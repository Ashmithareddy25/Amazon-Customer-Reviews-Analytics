0345803485|1.0|Wow I am not sure if it's because I listened to the audio version (that was thankfully free) but if it wasn't for my curiosity to see what all the hubbub was about I would have had to shut it off after the first five minutes. It's simply horrible. The audio versions narrator is to teeny bopper in her impressions, it's bad.<br /><br />Yes there are a couple of steamy scenes towards the END of the book, really you could skip the first five to six chapters and not miss anything. It's very redundant, filler really of to many \\"holly crap\\" exclamations and over analyzing from the female lead.<br /><br />Some other reviews mention that it seems like this was written by some twenty year old girl and what her version of the perfect man is which sums it up exactly. This is really best left for the bored house wife to try to get ideas to spice up her love life or twenty year old crowd who loves drama and obvious endings which lead to sequels planned for corporate gains.
0634049011|2.0|I accidentally picked up this book thinking it was something else.  The book is well written and the author knowledgeable, but I don't think it is a clear teaching method for beginners.<br /><br />Chapter 2 on root shapes is brilliant and was enlightening for me even though I have been playing for over 25 years.<br /><br />For the part on building scales, I always have students build scales with the root on the E strings.  This builds the familiar 'box' shape for scales, of which the minor pentatonic is an example.  It makes a simple pattern that the student can move up or down to get into a different key with ease.  When a student masters the box position they can learn extensions to build on it and create a standard pattern that can be moved anywhere on the fretboard with the box as the center.  The author of the book has the reader build the scales lower on the fretboard, which is a good way of mentally building the scale I suppose, but does not give the budding guitarist a standard fingering position for all scales.<br /><br />The rest of the book has good theory about chords, etc, which are good to know but which I consider a more advanced topic.<br /><br />So the book targets the beginner but it is not a beginner book.  Who then should buy this book?<br /><br />Re-selling mine at a reasonable price on Amazon if anyone is interested.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Well worth the money and cannot wait for the next installment.  Too short as I didn't want it to end!
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Better than Vicodin and Norco, lots of talking. If u wanna great sleep rent this! I am sorry I did!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Great free product to help clean out unwanted programs and cookies on the kindle fire. Uses little memory. Gave me extra free space son could down load more games.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Get CD and I am listening to it almost daily. We are really happy to get the CD.  Thank you
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This album has impacted my life so much! I Love it! I Love having classic CDs on deck. Always a good one.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Looper is a rare film that tries to do more than just entertain with a slick premise and pointless action. (Think Total Recall remake) This is science fiction, which is supposed to make you think as well as entertain you.<br /><br />The description is already posted, so I won't rehash. I'll start off by saying that it was refreshing to see Bruce Willis in a movie where he's not just cashing a check on his Die Hard persona. I haven't enjoyed a performance from him since Twelve Monkeys, which certain aspects of the film give just a slight nod to.<br /><br />Joseph Gordan-Levitt proves once again that he's capable of lead man status with his multi-layered performance as a dead man walking who gets the wake up call of his life while literally facing his own future.<br /><br />They dystopian version of the future was realistic and veers away from the constant Blade Runner knock offs that we've seen time and again in sci fi films. The darkness in this future isn't in endless scenes of darkness and rain, it's in the souls of its inhabitants.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd knock is that the story tries to encompass too many themes at once, which isn't such a bad thing when you compare it to the trivial plots of so called films that are being produced right now. Time travel and meeting one's future self is quite a load, however, and would have been perfectly sufficient without the additional moral quandary of whether it's acceptable to kill someone before they have a chance to become the worst type of person.<br /><br />Still, the beauty of the story is that it manages to juggle all of its themes without dropping the ball. The characters are fresh, the acting superb, and the movie ends cleanly, wrapping up the time travel paradoxes with a single act.<br /><br />The only thing I regret is not seeing this sooner.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I purchased this app thinking that it would be quick, easy way to access Facebook without going in my browser, like I would on a regular computer.  However, I was wrong! I ended up deleting this app off of my Kindle Fire for a number of reasons.  First, the news feed doesn't let you see past the first couple posts.  It doesn't even show an option to load more stories like it would on your desktop version.  Second, it sometimes lets you comment on other posts and sometimes it doesn't.  You sometimes can access the comments but then it won't let you post a response.  Third, it is really slow to load, even with full strength of Wi-Fi connection.  I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone that is looking to put it on their Kindle Fire.  I have found a way that is easy and quick other than the app.  I would recommend pulling up your browser and have the Facebook desktop version set as kind of a home page.  It actually saves your login information so it's always ready for access.  This works A LOT better and has everything that you would on a regular computer but doesn't show ads which is really nice!!  I hope Facebook does something about their app because it has many glitches that need to be fixed to make it more user friendly.
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|Friends of mine have given this film rave reviews but aside from a few really charming moments 500 Days of Summer is a pretty average romance story. The end gave me the feeling that the main character has obsessive, stalker like tendencies which put me off. The moments that charm you make it worth a watch so at least you can hold your own in a conversation in which this film may come up.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game I used to play this card game. I like that you play people not the computer and its fun for all ages
B0067R0APK|5.0|It's good and efficient. It shows up to 5 cities.<br />Then weather shown is accurate and we can easily shuffle between different cities.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book is an excellent source of knowledge for improving how IT can be incorporated into business and together bring great results.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I got it as a free book and it was a really great find. Fast paced and action packed. The story is constantly moving and has a few good twists.
B000MV9026|5.0|great item
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It was hard to read but only because I have been reading these since I got my first library card at thirteen. It is a good read and I couldn't put it down. It left a few open plot lines but then again it isn't really an end the wheel keeps on turning.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I'll admit that I only watched part of the 1st season when this aired in 2001, but after the new ST movies, I decided to go back and finish the rest of this series. Like all of the ST seasons, it has its highs & lows, but overall the series does an excellent job of recognizing the trajectory shown between all the series and effectively projecting it backwards, to establish a history and tone that feel right in pre-dating the original series. Given that it is now the only series that remains canon in the new ST continuity (with the movies introducing an alternative timeline), it is worth watching as it remains a logical lead-in to the 2009 and 2013 movies. Overall a great set of stories pre-dating the creation of the United Federation of Planets in the ST universe.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|2012R: A little reminiscent of LA Confidential, except darker. Good, solid gangster flick. Didn't care for the sappy speech at the end, but otherwise a keeper. Enjoy. MFJLabs 4x
B00421IR5I|2.0|This may have been an instance of mismatched expectations. Perhaps I was expecting something gently nostalgic? Or more  subtle than a Hollywood comedy (or a Hollywood film for kids). There are occasional and wonderful moments of observational humor. Mostly, though, this is broad farce.<br /><br />What the writers considered to be funny: it's nearly always based on a familiar formula, one of which I'm admittedly weary: such that this will feel more like a pet peeve than an opinion. But nevertheless, the sort of thing where characters are repeatedly (and at times sadistically) tormented, for the sake of a few chuckles? Don't like it, never did: and this film relies on it. In ways both predictable and tiresome.<br /><br />(Of course, some viewers will find it more to their liking. I wouldn't want to cast aspersions on someone else's enjoyment. This isn't an awful movie; it's simply not the sort of thing I particularly enjoy.)<br /><br />The young actors do a fine job. Which could have been a challenge, given that most of the characters are little more than stereotypes: i.e. the kid who eats too much, the \\"dumb\\" kid, the \\"teacher's pet\\" who's a prissy tattletale, etc. Oh but they're somewhat affectionately portrayed, as cardboard cutouts go. (Except the obsessively-studious boy. Not a surprise that he's repeatedly bullied, but appalling how he's portrayed as fully deserving of every taunt and assault.) Nicolas is more well-rounded. Not terribly interesting: although--compared to his schoolmates--he's remarkably complex.<br /><br />Despite being boxed-in by similarly stereotypical characteristics? The foibles of Nicolas' parents (and of the other kids' parents, and the teacher) are a highlight, and got the most enthusiastic laughs. I recognize I may feel this way because they're adults and \\"can take it.\\" Whereas seeing winsome, endearing kids endure mind-numbing mistreatment? Before using the word \\"funny,\\" I'd think of plenty of less-flattering ways to characterize theirseemingly-unending woes.<br /><br />Tone is everything. In Fargo many of the characters are tremendously engaging: including those who are loathsome. Even when they're placed in agonizing situations, it's hilarious.<br /><br />Le Petit Nicolas, superficially, appears a charming story about a group of prepossesing (even adorable) schoolboys. Then, at length, we see them (metaphorically) put through the woodchipper. This is neither Fargo nor South Park. It doesn't feel wrong; it feels worse than wrong.
0756655307|5.0|This an excellent encyclopedia that have nice illustrations and a complete information of all the marvel characters. Good buy for a marvel comics fan.
B00810SCCY|2.0|my least favorite of all of Jane Austin's novels.  Had trouble actually finishing it.  I preferred Persuasion and Pride & Prejudice over this one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Imagine a world without hate, violence, pain, sorrow, evil, yup that's what I imagine heaven would be like. Great story.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Great cd love it. Came really fast and love almost every song on the cd, I would recommend for the people that love the old rock music.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This group continue to amaze us with their talent. I am sure their next album will be  just as good.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|We know so little about the Saxon kingdoms following their seizure of Britain from the Celts that Bernard Cornwell's version may be as good as any historian's. In fact, in his own way Cornwell is a historian. He just makes things more entertaining. I trust him, in so far as is possible, to stick with the main facts (?) and provide reasonable guesses as to the details. Is there any man alive who knows more about the Saxon Shield Wall? Is there any man still breathing who knows more about what it is like to fight in one? Yes, he tends more to the super heroic than is probable, but I do realize this is fiction. Nevertheless, when he describes the differences between swords of the time. I believe him. When he says there was a battle between Saxons and (probably) Danes at such and such a place when Alfred was king, I think he is telling me as much as we know. I accept as fiction the story of a warrior who ends every book personally winning every battle. I have read all of this series and feel at home with every book. I may read them again 10 or 20 years from now. If so, I believe I will enjoy them just as much. Why 4 stars instead of 5? I really don't know. It would be very difficult to avoid a little sameness. I suppose that's it.
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|I like Darius, but their are only a couple of songs that I really enjoyed on this album. I was really disappointed.
B00009L1OB|1.0|I was sorely disappointed when I put this disk in my CD player. The very first thing I had to do was turn my volume way down, because the music is compressed and burned hot. Apparently some people like it that way, I don't, and if I did I still have some old 45s around of some of the tracks on this album. Some of us are buying a CD to avoid the work of ripping an old vinyl copy, but one of the expected benefits of the CD is that the sound quality should be better than old scratchy vinyl, and this isn't the case.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Cheryl's odyssey was interesting and the camaraderie of the trail was an important part of the story.  However, I found all her sexual exploits and references to sexual exploits not to be germane to the gist of the story.  I had the sense that these episodes were meant to titillate and sell books and really had no place in the book.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Enjoyable story of a time and place no longer seen. A small town community interacts in all sorts of situations. It was worth it to me just to see the lace that places a part in one of the episodes. Entertaining and ultimately, a reaffirmation of life and the people who live it.
1781162646|4.0|I read this book because I feel that Stephen King is a master at character and plot development. This story revolves around people in a carnival. The people are well-sketched out, and the plot has the usual King twists that keep you reading to find out how everything turns out. I don't think it is his best book, but definitely a page-turner. I did like the ending too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although the setting of this book is in Afghanistan, it addresses powerful issues that all humans face in every time and place. True - some of them are exaggerated because of the location. Sometimes a particular location causes certain elements to be more of a player than another location would do. Yet, the themes are universal. This book will win many awards, I am sure. Don't miss this book. Seriously. Don't miss this book.
B0085OEIOC|3.0|Not nearly ss good or coherant as Airplane, this movie spoofs both musicals and spy movies. My favorite scene is Nick proving he is not Mel Torme in Der Pizza Haus.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|A little on the darker side for QOTSA, a little bit slower... but as always edgy, lean, and indifferent.  Great album.
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|This is a fun movie that mirrors several of Shakespeare's plays while showing how his most famous one may have come together.  It is entertaing and light, but has depths for anyone who looks.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a good game but there is one problem... on my kindle it stops working so you need to uninstall it boohoo
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked it as soon as I figured what he was doing, going from story to story, but tying the characters together.  I liked the first two books more, but found this one very  interesting.
B008Y73940|5.0|Waited quite awhile to watch this as Matthew McConaughey just wears me out sometimes. But, this is a really good movie. Well worth watching.
B000ZNRBK4|1.0|This is the second on that I've purchased recently and both have fallen apart the first time I used them.  The springs pop out and it falls off the camera.  It is as fragile as an egg shell.  On the plus side, it does fit good and is easy to put on and take off of my lens.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My grandkids love this movie. It is entertaining even to adults. The little girl is excellent. While the subject is quite serious the story develops in a comic book kind of story.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is the first Gaiman book I've read (I know! What was I waiting for?) and I LOVED it. I devoured it. What a beautiful, magical little tale. You should read it. Now.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Like all of the Harry Potter series this is of course great. I love the simple complexity of the story. Harry is a hero as always.
030789701X|5.0|Hard cover, full color and more pages than you can count! Well... 1117 actually.<br /><br />This is a fantastic guide. It has every quest in the game detailed within. I had played the game before and thought had seen most of it. I was very wrong. Like all Bethesda games there is so much to do and find in the world that it can be overwhelming, this guide really helps you hone in on a particular quest you want to do or item you want to find.<br /><br />That being said, Skyrim is very much about exploring the world for yourself and the writers know that, giving you ample spoiler warnings and never to much direction that it feels intrusive into your game.<br /><br />Even if you aren't the kind of person that uses guides with a game as big as Skyrim a guide like this is an amazing help. It really can't be compared to online walkthroughs or wiki guides. Having the physical item in this case is infinitely more helpful.
0812983459|5.0|This book took you through an incredible journey with a gentleman who was on a mission and completed it with more than he expected then realized his happiness was right at his fingertips at home  I loved it.
140006922X|3.0|It looks like an interesting book, but an imperfect book, one that should be cross-referenced with other books. It would have been helpful if Aslan had included some reference notes. Some aspects of this history may be more accurate than other popular texts, but not all. Aslan makes a very common mistake in the title of the book. Jesus (Yeshua)was not \\"of Nazareth\\", a town which didn't exist at the time and for decades afterward, but was \\"the Nazarean\\" (ha-Notzri,in Hebrew \\"the Watchman\\"), one of the Watchmen faction(ha Notzrim), who aggressively contested both the Jewish (Judean) establishment of the time and their Roman overlords. Aslan seems to have picked up on much of the political dimension of the time, but glossed over in the \\"gospels\\".
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Wow! A book with a whole new angle and real to life characters that everyone will love!  I loved the twists and turns, the real life problems to be dealt with, the whole concept!  Thank you so much Rebecca Stead for your creative thinking and down to earth writing!  I recommend this book to all readers!  If you like it, you would also like the book [[ASIN:B008TD3HAA For the Love of Petey]]
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neal has done it again. After reading The Graveyard book and loving Bod I wasn't sure he could make me fall in love again but he did. This book was wonderful first read, but it makes me want to re-read it to find what I might have missed. It's a very personal book for Neal because he left a part of himself in the character who tells the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is good exercise for yourbrain. It makes you use your powers of reason and deduction as well as memory. Hurry up with the next levels please.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|it was an okay. movie. I thought I would be dissapointed that I didnt see it in theaters, but now that I watched it, I'm glad I did not. It wasnt a horrible movie and I was able to watch it all the way through.
B00AHXIC50|1.0|I felt like there were only a couple of good songs on here. Definitely should have previewed before I bought it, but it was on sale for an extremely low price and thus, I don't feel like it was too much of a waste of money. I have no problem with the language or the lyrical content but I just found it to be boring and repetitive.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I liked it. not as cool as the first season, but I still liked it. it was cool how they used the same actors in different story lines.
B001P3SA94|5.0|If you love the blues, this is a must have movie that tells the story of Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Howling Wolf, Little Walter, Etta James start in the music business.  I only wish the movie was longer.  The music is great!
B00DHNBY02|2.0|I purchased this movie to watch in HD on my computer. it wont let me watch it in HD unless I use a kindle, ps3, xbox, or whatever. highly dissapointing.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|After seeing all the other Die Hard Movies I must say that this was just not up to previous standards. The script had Willis acting like an idiot in the beginning. He was always smart enough to outfox the other bad guys so it just was not a good start. It improved as the movie went on but................
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse novel's, and I couldn't tell you my favorite. I wish the books didn't I feel in love with each character and once I started reader I couldn't put it down. I'd finish each book within two days and couldn't wait for the next one. I can't wait to read what else Charlaine Harris comes out with..
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great spin on classic game. Fast game play and easy intuitive navigation make this game great. Cool retro graphics and effects
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its not the best game I have on my kindle fire but I still like it its not as had as some other games
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it!  so does my nephew!  we have a great time doing this together! two heads are better than one!!
B00A86AIAI|5.0|I love everything about this model and hope to buy at least Superman and Wonder Woman in the near future.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is one of the best HO/mini-puzzle/adventure games I've played. The graphics are great, and I really like using the &quot;hint&quot; button to navigate without having to wait for it to recharge. The demo really gets you hooked, with a creepy cliffhanger to get you to buy the full version. I hope it lives up to the demo!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. I like it a lot. I want to work in a salon when I'm older. I'm 7.
B001NA6096|5.0|I like the fact that there are three movies that denote the relationship between the characters at different stages of their lives.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I enjoy The Tudors,but it is missing the clever humor of Game of Thrones and Rome. It is nice to see some of the same actors in these shows. Natalie Dormer is great in The Tudors as she is in GoT.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Loved seeing this second episode in the lives of these interesting characters.  Can't wait to see the third one when available.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I gave the movie 3 stars because it did have some great action sequence and some funny moments. Unfortunately these qualities aren't the only things that makes a movie. The movie started off with crazy events and then it slowed down trying to build the momentum for the movie. when the momentum was build, the storyline was whack! &#34;I was like really?! All this for that!!&#34;
B005544TRQ|4.0|I began watching the series and will continue to view episodes when I have more time.  It's not yet got me hooked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun! It is very entertaining and has definitely kept me busy. I will recommend this to all my friends.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this for a family member and was given it by another!  We are  very much a dog family and the dog on the cover is a ringer for my recently rescued Flat-coated retriever mix.  I rescued her and a Newfoundland in November and this was a perfect addition to our dog library.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Having been a long time fan, Koi No Yokan is another extraordinary step forward. This album has everything that you'd expect from a Deftones album and a few surprises thrown in. Get it, listen to and enjoy it!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so enjoying watching the Downton Abbey series.  The acting is wonderful, the costumes and sets are fabulous.  I am looking forward to Season 4!
0307730700|5.0|This book had it all. Made me laugh and made me cry. The situations faced by Adam and his determination and inner strength to get over the problems was mind blowing. If I could be half the man Adam was on my best day, is something I am aiming for. Adam's story and ultimate sacrifice is a must read for everyone. Adam's story is heartfelt and very touching. Read it now.
B000001F76|1.0|this cd would not play on my PC. I could not make a personal copy for my car.<br />it would play on a cd player.<br />I took it to a computer shop and they said it was encoded with information that prevented any coping what so ever.<br />I  reported the problem to the seller and they gave m a choice of replacement or refund. I chose replacement so I could make a personal copy for my vehicle.<br />the seller sent a refund instead.<br />very unhappy with disc and seller. i.will not use again
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Amazing movie; well acted, directed, and written. To be as brief as possible:<br />-If you are a Superman \\"comic series/book\\" fan, I have one word for you: \\"Wow\\"!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game when I am bored I just play this game. I find my self playing it in till late at night I just love it
B007NZDES0|5.0|Like being at a live concert.  Beautifully produced with amazing sets, effects and music.  The best part is that it is live band not lip synced.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|This is different for Yanni.  It seems he is expressing a different message through music than most of his other albums.  I love the title &#34;Truth Of Touch&#34; because it expresses a major factor in human relationships.  The music isn't the only thing about this album worth contemplating!
B005USZYDU|4.0|A good hero for kids.  Enjoyed the story and the idea of a John Grisham series for kids.  Looking forward to sharing with my younger friends.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. It was a wonderful, touching story.  The ending was perfect but I enjoyed getting to know the characters so much that I wish it hadn't ended where it did.  I want to know what happens next.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A little predictable but a very good story, well written in an interesting tone.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to friends.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Romeo and Juliet, with zombies. Can't beat it! I've heard that the book ends quite differently, so book purists beware.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so fun And<br /><br /> alsome I love it I wish it was real I want a horse. it would be alsome
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The depth of the characters are multi layered.  You expect to leave you driveway and wave to them on the way out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a great game.always different.relaxing to sit and study what needed to be done next to open the doors and get to the next floor.
159463176X|4.0|Some say its disjointed. It's a story entwined by the telling of each characters point of view in each chapter.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|My wife and I always looked at the previews for this movie and wanted to see it but never made time....I wish we would have.  I am a QT fan and always love his movies but I have to say, this may be the best one yet.  EVERY character is perfect!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
B009C7JS14|5.0|I lve having the Weather right there on my phone........it just really works for me!  I certainly always want to be able to see it especially if I am away.
B00821OX98|4.0|They've even got a Darryl type character in there. Less teeth than walking dead, this rated PG to TWD's R. Useless add the sappy all-american themes laced in. Post-apocalyptic I love tho, and TWD too, so this one services my fix meanwhile. lotta fun for me, maybe u 2.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Helps me plan my day or my week..  I use everyday before I send the guys out weather or not.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the story lines. Totally enjoy watching this show . Like most legal thrillers. Looking forward to the third season.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We love this app! It's the best Weather app out there.  The new look is great Thank you Weather Channel!<br />Hammer's
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really great game. Whenever I play this when I'm bored, I never seem to stop. It really is a fun game!:)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie is well worth watching.  If you're like me you are tired of trying to choose a movie worth a damn from a list of budget or outdated offerings.  This one is OK.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|It is a really nice tool to open the document files if you are frequently looking to open and edit email attchments
141659521X|5.0|My deepest sympathy and prayers for his family, and the book was like all his others just wonderful.<br />Will truly miss his writing.
B000FBFM9S|2.0|Otherwise, I would have quit after about 3 chapters.  There was not enough story to keep my interest.  After all the big buildup to the last scene, the characters didn't have a realistic end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! I am a huge lover of despicable me and despicable me 2 both films are just amazing! I really love agnes and fluffy as well as the minions so the fact that they have managed to intwine agnes and her cute unicorn is fantastic for lovers of anything adorable!!!! 5 out of 5 for me, a lot better than subway dash, plus Dave?! Really dave?! I am in love with this addictive app!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|George R. R. Martin has developed a good series with this first book of Thrones.  His writing is engrossing and can be hard to put down once started.  I am coverting my reading to my Kindle and this book was one of my first fiction novels I completely read on this digital reading device.  I like the convenience of the digital format.  Imagine a medium where all your reads are in your hand, books, how to's and DIY reading, periodicals and your music also.  The eye strain will need to be gotten used to, but since the late 80's I've haven't adapted so completely to the computers I've used to really have grown to love every aspect of the digital age, but it is here and I am adapting.  GRR Martin, is an accomplished screen writer who when putting his skills forward to Fiction Novels designed to be made into Movies or TV Mini Series, lays the foundation for much to come.  I expect this to continue on to a popularity of any writer in our history.  Including the gread JRR Tolkein.
B00821OX98|3.0|Id rather give 3 and a half stars to this, because for people that have never experienced a show like this (group of people faced with a dire situation, have to get together and work as a team)  then its probably good.  I watch a lot of shows like this, and it gets boring after a while to see the same thing again and again...  I think the style is just getting tired.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The Idea for rhe show is awesome and the way they follow through with great plot and twists and turns makes for an exciting evening of television!!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Really?? I was very disappointed by this book. It focused so heavily on ftbll yet we never know what happens with pats dad, his new relationship or his friendship with cliff. Feels like a few chapters of this book are missing I hope the movie is better
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|On the books Jack is tall and powerful and sexy as all get out with a little rough around the edges Cruise just misses the mark as far as Casting goes his portrayal is not bad but just does not live up the the expectations of the character defined in the books.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is honestly the best Sherlock Holmes show ever made.  And of course it had to be the Brits to do it right!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Loved the characters, the storyline as well. And I had trouble putting it down. I will read Gillian Flynn again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If it continues as the first two seasons I am sure I will love it.  Can't wait to get to it.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I expected this movie to be a little better than what is was.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but when she changed into a witch I was disappointed in her &#34;make-up&#34;. She seemed too cartoony to me.  I agree with others that for the cost you should be able to get 2D and 3D, but companies want to make their money and as I did people will buy regardless. Overall, a fun movie night with the family.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is great.  I had to wait between season one and season two because of the shipping time but so far it was worth it.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love Phantom of the Opera on Broadway and I love this movie.  The singing is beautiful, the acting fantastic and overall it is just an amazing movie.  Favorite part in the movie and on broadway has always been masquerade.  If you like the musical you will enjoy the movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love star wars, and angry bird just made it even better. Amazon special! It's now free. Great game and free, you can go wrong.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Since ditching cable this year, I've started to dig into streaming a lot more. My gf and I burned through a lot of shows this winter, and in a search for something else to dive into, we stumbled on The Good Wife. Very quickly we began watching 2-3 episodes at a time. Very entertaining. Not too predictable. Plenty of episodes in the 1st season. We are looking forward to season 2.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is exellent. This is just what i was looking for! I used the \\"word\\" like feature for having my resume and cover letter on hand and available for email, and the \\"excel\\" like feature to make menstrual charts for my teenaged girls. I have not used the \\"powerpoint\\" like feature yet but I'm sure I will not be disappointed.  The app is easy to use and has a lot of the same options as ms office. I would absolutely recommend this app to all!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|2nd read even better... think about this... If all nations &  peeps involved had not blundered into WW1 ... Not a single person who read this book would be alive...
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Quality show. I like it. It is not HD and the resolution is little low so I give a 4 star.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Expressive face. Just a delight to watch it  Didn't even mind the sub titles. What more can I say? Right
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I gave 4 stars because its so informative but i prefer the previous design/display that you used for years,straight and to the point. Guess i just need to do a little adjusting and get with the times. If it till had the previous design , it definitely would have been 5 stars.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This timeless classic may strain adult imaginations but the awe surrounding Spring is still its strongest part. To bring a neglected patch to life and watch the progress has to be inspiring enough to even bring healing.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Although not as good as the first one, it had some very funny moments. Great for adults, but not for kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. The characters are well developed, lots of emotion, but twists and scenarios I never would have expected. Good from beginning to end. I can't wait to read more about Dean.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|This book was recommended to me by my boyfriend, he said he read it when he was young and liked it. It turned out he was thinking of White Fang by Jack London not The Call of the Wild. This book started off great Buck was happy and had a great life. Then he gets dognapped and the book is downhill right up until the end. They beat him a lot almost kill him a few times. I don't want to give away the end but it makes the book worth reading, if you can stomach how mean they are to Buck. I cried a few times.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy.  It was edgier and more raw than 50 Shades and a quick read. The ending was a disappointment, leaving the reader hanging.  Good beach reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I chose five stars because it really deserved it. Suzanne Collins has done a great job. I have read some of her other books as well all I can say WOW she is a really good author.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I've watched the Harry Potter series so many times.  I loved Tolkien's books, but those movies have been a disappointment.  In this case, the Potter movies are so much better than the Potter books. What else is there to say? Enjoy
B000000H6Y|5.0|This is a must have cd christian woman is my favorate song will play for years to come thanks for listing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly recommend! Great for any age group I believe I will start letting my daughter play this game as it is very well put together and easy to use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was looking for a game like this to were I can make care of my horse. I have always wanted a horse and now I've got a virtual one. When u first start the game, on Kindle Fires it'll take some time to load. So don't exit the game like I did, just wait and it'll load. Other than that I hope u will enjoy this game or app.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Who has not seen these? I had all of these on dvd, but had to get these on blu ray and they did not disappoint.  Get these great, all are so good!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case is lightweight and gives me comfort to know my Kindle Fire has a protective shell around it.  Nice product.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I usually like the meeting of fantasy and history, and the Discovery of Witches had me hooked from the beginning.  But for some reason the romance was a little too brooding and possessive.  Ongoing stories can be fun when there is enough story and a definite resolution at the end of each book.  I have an idea how this story ends and am not compelled to read the second and third books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game, great puzzles that weren't too difficult  . Enjoyed the story line, only wish it would have been a little longer for the price (I paid $499)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a complete surprise for me.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down.  The twists and surprises will keep you up wanting to find out what happens.  Will make you consider who is living next door.
B000002KDO|5.0|3rd album which some consider to be the first stoner album with the first song being sweet leaf, but its much more than that. Songs like After forever, children of the grave, lord of the world. If you think BS is a satanic band this album will change your mind. Listen, read the lyrics and take your self back 1971. must buy !
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled isn't for the innocent.  There's sex, and there's language, but it's funny.  I enjoyed reading the man's point of view.
B000NA77YO|5.0|The Dio years is a great collection of Black Sabbath music with the roar and high range of Ronnie James Dio RIP. If you are an Original Black Sabbath fan with Ozzy this album isn't for you. If you like Dio it's a must have. Ozzy and Dio are two different groups with Black Sabbath. It's like beer or wine.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|KA-BAR knifes are built to last & the BK2 is no exception.  This thing is solid.  Highly recommended by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and Editor of Natural News.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Very funny! Both my husband and I enjoyed it.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|The movie sucks big time. Do not rent this movie. Spend your money in something else. A waste of time and it cost me $4 dollars that i will never recover.
193700788X|3.0|I can't say I hated the last novel of the Sookie Stackhouse series, but I can't say it was a great book either (even for fluff reading). This was definitely a book for fans to say goodbye, but there were some serious story writing fundamentals that needed to have been worked out. I will first talk about them generically for folks who have not read the book, and then do a spoiler line and go into more detail.<br /><br />First, Harris attempted a new Point of View for the writing of the book. This could have been a refreshing and hip way to end the series, but it did not work well. It was very confusing and for anyone who does not have a perfect memory, you are frustrated with trying to figure out who she is talking about as she jumps from setting to setting. Second, the plot of the story is non-existent. Yes there are bad guys, but there is no seamless threads and connections and when it all comes together at the end, you just want it to be over rather than experiencing the action through the story telling. Lastly, there are HUGE continuity issues in this novel. I don't think these are real spoilers, but be careful if you read the next couple of sentences. Characters don't just change and develop because of things that have happened to them (like same being brought back from being dead), but they actually have a different personality. I will take Sookie as a prime example in a least non-spoiler kinda of way. First, she has become WAY more religious than in any of the other novels. It permeates her life. It is really weird. Then there is the whole \\"telepathic\\" change. Sookie we know and loved had a horrible time being around any human because of how their minds were. She really had to work to not read a mind. That has totally be negated in this book. She goes here and there and everywhere and is all fine and dandy. She tries to listen to people (when she wants to) and when she wants to, it's ok. And she hasn't had any special training. Those are just some of the examples.<br /><br />***NOW THE SPOILERS****:<br /><br />Back to the plot, there was way to much going on and it all really didn't match up. Instead of focusing getting the reader drawn in with the Arlene murder and the Devil pact, all we get is a lot of domestic stuff and Sookie whining if she should go into work and how she is going to feed all the folks in her house, why her tomatoes are so big, and why her friends annoy her. While people have been focusing on the Sookie and Sam ending, I think it is more a lack of character continuity that really is what has unnerved folks. As a writer, I don't think the Eric/Sookie relationship could have ever worked out (she did well explaining that), but I think a Bill/Sookie could have worked out well. I think Sookie could have re-evaluated her anger she had toward him and if she really hated him or hated all the circumstances that initially led them together. We see a glimmer of this when she had a very heart to heart discussion with Amelia. It is this conversation where Amelia points out what non telepath humans have to deal with every day not being able to listen into the thoughts of others and what Sookie experiences with vampires (hence why a vamp relationships is probably best for Sookie).<br /><br />In the end, Sookie is far from a normal human. While I agree Sookie's place is in Bon Temps and satisfied with those last lines in the book, I am not sure if Harris felt pressure from her own personal beliefs, family, religion,or community, but she took Soookie and did a complete 180 with her character. Because of Sookie's abilities (as they were in the prior 12 books), she could never truly fit into human lifestyle. Harris made a choice to throw that to the wind and make her abilities less of an issue so Sookie could fit into the average old human world. That just doesn't mesh with the series. I do give Harris credit that she does leave Sookie, unmarried, childless, and dating versus a truly committed relationship. It could have been very easy for her to have had Sookie wedded, bedded, barefoot, and pregnant. And I think because Harris does refrain from this that I can give it 3 stars, though I am more inclined to 2 1/2.ve been very easy for her to have had Sookie wedded, bedded, barefoot, and pregnant. And I think because Harris does refrain from this that I can give it 3 stars, though I am more inclined to 2 1/2.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I have all the another movies of the terminator. But I was missing this one. Now my collection is done. Great movie.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Fascinating beginning of a compelling story. Acting Is five stars. Storylines are four but having seen the ensuing seasons they do get better and better.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It is a challenge- even though you feel you- know each symbol - Difficult- and challenging- even though you do the same one- twice-
B001DUGOWY|5.0|Steinbeck exposes what lies back of american development during the past decades. The sliding from the \\"american ideal\\" to todays wealth-based udemocratic society, depicted by the development of the main character, Ethan Allen. Steinbeck is among the very few that present the feelings that led to emigration from the States in the mid 60s.<br />A gripping book!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I normally read when I travel on business.  This was a two trip page turner.  Highly addictive series that I would recommend to anyone.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|This is well worth the investment I think, as a fan of this show. If you liked this show I highly recommend buying these high def 1080 pixel disks. Friends is a show I can watch over and over, also so much fun to watch without commercials.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Enjoyable game worth the space. Battles are fun and building even more fun. Very relaxing, just wish my friends would accept and have even more fun.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love it. Addicted to it. Can't wait for the new season. Great storytelling. Plus learning about corporate law each episode.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I never finished this book.  Found it boring.  A story needs to involve me and this one didn't.  I usually like Michael Connelly so I was disappointed.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Great drama during the film.  The kids done a good job. Good fantasy movie worth watching. I will watch it all over again.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland Rocks!  Good story, Great Characters, and enough twists to get the blood pumping!  Stephen King writes and I read...  No questions asked!!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|This is one of John Le Carre's best.  The quality of the writing and the character development are superb and the international analysis masterful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who is not watching Downton Abbey.  Nobody I know DOESN'T WATCH THIS EXCELLENT SERIES!!  It is very addictive and a marvelous viewing experience
B005TKD8ZK|4.0|Interesting view on running and writing, not a book on how to run. Pleasant to read. As a runner myself I could relate to the author, even if some of his considerations are very personal.
B004EF65QA|4.0|This rather classic story is well acted, and the camera shows very effectively the squalor and poverty of a British mill town in the mid-nineteenth century.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies it will have u on the edge of your seat what a twist u would never expect Anthony Hopkins does a great job
B004UID2LC|1.0|I down loaded this and tried to watch some videos.  My kindle froze and I couldn't get it to do anything until I deleted it from my device.  Could it have been the video?  Maybe, but it was a Rush song that I had watched on my lap top without a problem.
B00DM0UTPQ|2.0|I like a good submarine movie, but this is no Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide.<br />The plot moves too slow.<br />Did not feel engaged to the movie throughout.<br /><br />The story is intriguing, but that did not sustain the movie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Bringing all these characters together in 1 movie was a hoot!  Action, comedy, and characters that I would like to go get a sandwich with (spoiler alert) made for a movie that I enjoyed from the beginning to the end (which makes it quite obvious there will be another movie)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would have said I LOVE it but it isn't the greatest app ever. cocidering that its just like every other running game on the market so I wouldn't sugjest you get this app but it isn't bad only because it has some more material that you can get with fake money in the shop, some new material, and I enjoy how they have the world tour part because sometimes it is boring seeing the same background every time you play.
B0014C0BMU|5.0|Like all the Matrix movies you are challenged to redefine your reality and what is or is not possible in it.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This product works fine with my Kindle Fire HD. I have had no problems with it. I just needed to buy a replacement because I lost my original. Does not come with an AC adapter.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Author shows great insight to the human spirit.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Some names were hard to keep straight but was worth the effort.
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|We watched Lego Batman as an afternoon treat. The was engaging for them and they weren't restless or fidgety. I rented SD it was good quality and played smoothly.
1597801585|5.0|I loved this book.  I completely enjoyed the story line.  I found myself having to put it down just so I could make the experience last longer.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I would say this is a good puzzle app. The numbers go from easy to impossible to see. And no puzzle can be solve in under five minutes. Get this one if you really need to test your brain.
B0043UB0EI|4.0|Very good movie, too much animation but overall very good plot. There is lots of sex in it so if you have kids be sure to keep away from them. Easy to download
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google, is great, give it a try, you can find most anything that you want to find. I use google everyday.
B00CEMH31Q|3.0|I own them all. This one has too few singles  in my opinion. Get the Girl Back(GTGB) is a great song but not indicative of the entire album at all. Makes me thing GTGB was a holdover from Shout it Out. I still think this is a great band with incredible musicality but this album just didn't do it for me. Oh well.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie. Well done. Why do I need to put in more rubbish when this pretty much covers it all?
0440246318|4.0|Jack Reacher is my favorite protagonist.  Although the usual plot is &#34;he gets into trouble, then gets into more trouble, but gets out of it in the end&#34;, there are twists that still surprise me, a long-time reader of Lee Child.  Lee Child has that easy, clear writing style which allows the reader to follow the story as if one is on the scene.  I never tire of Jack Reacher's escapades although I wish he would settle down in one place for a while.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Adaptation of a graphic novel done just right, with a great cast, great action, done in a tongue in cheek manner.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This little book has what every reader looks for; I've not read anything like this. Whether you think you enjoy Gaiman or not ignore preconceptions for, this is new----oh, and it's very, very good.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Grave Encounters is a Canadian-American horror film. It is filmed in ''found footage'' style. This is a really scary movie, and I couldn't sleep properly for about a week after I first saw it. This movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The film is about a guy named Lance Preston and a group of people who are doing a reality show called ''Grave Encounters''. It is a ghost hunting reality show. The movie is one of their episodes where they go to a haunted mental institution. When they get there, they decide to film all the time. They soon realize that the place is actually haunted, and they can't stay in character anymore. They become literally terrified. They soon realize that the institution is not only haunted, it's alive. They run through the exit, and it is a whole new hallway. They look outside in the daytime, and it is still dark outside. They open their food bin, and all the food is rotten as if it's been there for months.<br /><br />Some of the scary things that happen are the following:<br /><br />1. A spirit moves Sasha's hair<br />2. Sasha wakes up, and the word ''Hello' is scratched on her back.<br />3. They see a woman in a room who then looks at them and her face contorts evilly<br />4. They find their friend Matt, who is now crazy. And he tells them ''they can all leave as soon as they're better''.<br />5. The group wakes up, and they are wearing patient bracelets with their names on them.<br />6. A girl who killed herself comes out of a bathtub filled with blood and grabs one of the crew members, then they both disappear<br />7. Many black arms come out of the walls and ceiling and start grabbing at them<br />8. Lance walks down a hallway, and an evil spirit runs at him and starts hitting the camera<br />9. Lance records himself and plays it back, and he hears spirits on his tape<br />10. Lance is trapped in a long underground hallway, and he hears spirits screaming and laughing.<br />11. The scene where Lance finds pictures of his friends being lobotomized.<br />12. The ending scene where Lance talks to the camera after the spirits have lobotomized him.<br /><br />This is a really original and horrifying movie. Sean Rogerson and Ashleigh Gryzko are good actors and they play their characters really well. It's a good and original horror film.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|One of the best movies made about Viet Nam. Nothing more can be said. It will be enjoyed for many more years to come.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An amazing series, the characters have developed so much and the emotional swings reach quite a broad spectrum.  The show really makes o e appreciate the growth of medical knowledge and procedures as well as communication and transportation
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I have been a fan of the old Tin Tin books, and this presentation brought them to life. An exciting story even for children. The HD quality was superb.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love mysteries and really read almost nothing but them but nothing prepared me for this book.  Every time I thought I knew where the plot was going it would zig where I thought it was going to zag, and then zag where I thought it would zig.  I never knew where the plot was going to take me and was pleasantly surprised when it went where it did.  A page turner that I read in basically a day.  I mean I just couldn't put it down.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|My favorite movie of all times. This must be about the 150th time I've watched it. What makes this particular presentation amazing is the HD. Ingrid Bergman never looked more beautiful. WOW!!!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|A unique approach - kind of silly, but perfect when you want to watch something light. This series is definitely worth watching.
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|To me this movie was just an overbearing mother driving her son crazy.  I didn't find it funny--just annoying.  Would not recommend.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Covers the spectrum of all things felt and experienced by alcoholics and abusers with the spice of being a headline rock and roll star!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Surprisingly addictive, quite a lot of gameplay without the need to spend money, though quite a few features need a small amount of money to use.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Anna Faris is absolutely hilarious in this film.  It's cute, quirky, and one of my new favorite romantic comedies!  And Chris Evans is pretty nice to look at which doesn't hurt. :)
B0012HF5NC|5.0|love this movie watch it every fourth of july. great movie a classic must see anytime of the year! great actors.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|This book changed my life; it is both inspirational and mind blowing.<br /><br />Although I found some of the main story/characters a little boring at times, the material covering our evolution and the history/biomechanics of running is what really made it for me.<br /><br />I bought this book as a gift for other people, or recommended it, and universally people have found it inspiring.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|have seen the other toy story movies. my grand children called me and told me that I had to watch this movie they loved it and so did I

B00CLD65X0|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy this show. The characters are well developed as is the plot. Not to mention their cool accents and costumes.
B00DFFHUUA|3.0|As long as you know you're about to watch G.I. Joe before you watch it, when you will not be disappointed. Believe it or not Ray Stevenson is probably the jewel in this entire film Except for the action choreographer. In essence, watch it for fun don't watch it for insight!
0718157834|5.0|I have taken ages to review this book, and even this will be short and sweet.<br /><br />While I wasn't completely smiling and in love with the end, and things didn't tie up how I wanted them too, everything in this novel stays true to the story that needs to be told. If you're looking for a glossy perfect story, this isn't it. The guy, Will, has problems and man he was a *meanie* for a lot of the time, but I saw through that because he like the rest of the characters have so much depth, he couldn't have been nice and all swoony with his situation and history.<br /><br />Lou, the lead female narrator was a favourite for me, too, because she had strong opinions that gave depth to her. But more than that I was with her and what she was trying to do the whole novel, but as things fell apart in her plan, I felt all her emotions and was with her through every peak and trough.<br /><br />This book mirrors the difficulties in life so well, I was astounded. I commend Jojo for creating such a deep, moving story, one with so many layers, I can't even begin to describe the story fully and do it justice.<br /><br />To sum up, this book is on my Best Everrr shelf for many reasons, one being how totally blown away I was by the journey and ending and that I haven't forgotten it even now, months after I finished.<br /><br />5++ stars!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Wow!!! Wow!!! Wow!!! Awesome!!! Stupendous!!! Terrific!!! Will watch entire series. This is what SiFi should be. Entertaining, Plausable and Fun.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am so glad that I took the time to watch this show.  The characters are well developed and the show is produced excellent.  I have to limit myself to one episode per night or I will end up watching four in a row.  I am almost half way through season 2 right now.  Great show.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am always searching for period books like this one. It is by far one of the greatest stories I've ever read.  The author has done a masterful piece of work and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves antebellum history as much as I do!  Marilyn Tooley
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really enjoyed all three books. Didn't know what to expect based on the title and the reviews, but they were great! A love story with a twist.
B007NESBK2|5.0|There is something about this unique and beautiful singer I love so much! She is so smooth and so good! I bought this Blu Ray Dvd of her because I have never seen much of her. It is awesome. She is a lovely lady and very talented. Put it in and you will have a great evening with Sade! Get it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best of the best from PBS. The best they have ever shown. I watch it over and over. Enjoy!
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|I love this game. It's very entertaining and fun. I enjoy it tremendously and have only one complaint. It frequently locks up during the beginning of new games. If it were not for that I would give it five stars.
B00821OX98|3.0|Another story of earth being besieged by an alien race.  The twist is the little \\"skitters\\" aren't exactly having the best of luck either.<br />Good effects.  Decent story line.  And a joke or two added in makes it worth watching.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Completely what I was looking for. Need something with local info and maps. Really love that it updates every 15 minutes and shows sever weather notifications.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|as usual sanderson delivers a uniquely entertaining experience and intrigueing characters in the shortest of moments.<br />Great read, sanderson continues sharing his fantasy brilliance in the emperor's soul.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Even two weeks later I still feel a part of the world Gaiman created and in many ways I'd like to stay in his world even with its evil.  The strength of his &#34;good&#34; beings makes you feel optimistic about the world.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book.  It was sad and happy and made me realize even though just snook that there truly is good in the world.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|Hoping it is good as the MSI motherboard I bought for it is D.O.A. Have had good luck with i3-3225 and expect this one to be just as good for non gaming use.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|The hype on this movie totally killed it. The gore factor was awesome, some scenes make me jump a little, but it wasn't that scary...
B003UBTX6S|4.0|So the second book wasn't as terrible as I thought it was going to be. The pace of this book flowed better than the first one which was great. It still took a while for the story to pick up and become interesting to the point where I didn't want to stop reading. I'm curious to see how the series ends so I'll be reading the last two books here pretty soon.
B000BT97AO|5.0|If you like artsy movies... this is for u! It is weird but awesome! It is a hard-to-find movie but it is worth purchasing. It shipped fast too!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|People even seem to love or hate this album. The old school thrash fans hate it because there are<br />only thrash parts in songs, but no really entire thrash songs. Fans that appreciate all types of metal and music,<br />and also appreciate good musicianship love this album. I happen to love this album. This album has rock, hard rock and metal, with some thrash parts mixed in. Mustaine has earned the right to do a album like this and if you give it a chance, you<br />will hear some great music. As far as heavy songs...Don't turn your back is excellent. It starts off with a blues intro and then goes into full on thrash. Jus ta great song. Kingmaker is a excellent heavy metal tune and it kicks off the album in fine form.<br />Built for war is a full on rage song with a nice helping hand from standout drummer Shawn Drover.<br />Beginning of sorrow is another standout track and it features the great bass playing of David Ellefson. Forget to remember is just a great song, reminds me of stuff off the Countdown album. its not thrash, but its in that area of hard rock to lighter metal but its just a excellent song about a very serious issue. This should have been there first single and whoever at the record label decided to release Super Collider the song as the first single, really blew it because its probably the worst song on the album. Dance in the rain is very good and the old school thrash fans will love the 2nd half of the song where it really heats up. The Thin Lizzy cover of Cold Sweat is a awesome track. I got to see them do this live recently and it blew me away! My dark horse song for best song on the album after Forget to remember and Don't turn your back...Its A House Divided. Just a great metal song and its a shame that this song only shows up as a bonus track which you cant get on all versions of this CD. The horns really add a vibe to this song which makes it even more awesome. Last but not least...The Blackest Crow has a evil banjo going through it played by none other than the great Dave Mustaine. Its a cool vibe type of song that really works in my opinion. What is so cool about this album? The different musical styles that you hearm including Rock, hard rock, bluegrass, blues, metal and thrash. You have to have a open mind, but if you appreciate mnetal musicians who can actually play, and like different types of music and like songs that are about other things than your normal metal topics like demons and devils, you will love this album!!!by none other than the great Dave Mustaine. Its a cool vibe type of song that really works in my opinion. What is so cool about this album?

0307271080|3.0|Adichie's third novel is the story of Ifemelu, a young Nigerian (Igbo) woman, finding her path in Africa and America. A great portion of the plot centers on her romantic struggles, and the 10% or so of the story that is not told from Ifemelu's perspective follows Obinze, her high school sweetheart, as he tries to build a life for himself in the UK and Nigeria. The book also has a lot to say on the subject of race - Ifemelu ultimately writes a very successful blog called \\"Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black,\\" portions of which are included in the story.<br /><br />This novel helped me to develop an appreciation for all sorts of experiences I wouldn't otherwise begin to understand: the richness of Nigerian culture, the deep, soul-shaking challenges of immigrating (especially in a post-9/11 world), the complex relationships between Africans and African-Americans. The writing style reminded me a bit of Jane Austen, with lots of keen (and often funny) observations about what makes people tick. One of my favorite passages went: \\"Ifemelu watched them, so alike in their looks, and both unhappy people. But Kimberly's unhappiness was inward, unacknowledged, shielded by her desire for things to be as they should, and also by hope: she believed in other people's happiness because it meant that she, too, might one day have it. Laura's unhappiness was different, spiky, she wished that everyone around her were unhappy because she had convinced herself that she would always be.\\" Another I liked: \\"Aunty Uju collected all of her dissatisfactions in a silk purse, nursing them, polishing them, and then on the Saturday of Ifemelu's visit, while Bartholomew was out and Dike upstairs, she would spill them out on the table, and turn each one this way and that, to catch the light.\\"<br /><br />What ruined this book for me was its arrant narcissism. Ifemelu, the main character (who happens to share a lot of the same biographical details with the author) is written as tiresomely flawless. She's brilliant, beautiful, and brave. Despite not having children of her own, Ifemelu appears to know better how to raise them than any of the parents she encounters: her aunt, a single-mother trying to become a doctor in the United States (whose son prefers Ifemelu to his own mother), the wealthy suburban mom who hires Ifemelu as nanny (whose daughter prefers Ifemelu to her own mother), the wife of her lover. Over the course of the novel, when she is compared to her boyfriends' other love interests, she always comes out ahead - the author even makes a point of saying that Ifemelu is chosen over a girl voted \\"most beautiful\\" at her high school, and later a woman voted \\"most beautiful\\" at the University of Lagos. And she's never, ever wrong. A high school friend says of her, \\"Ifemelu is one fine babe but she is too much trouble. She can argue. She can talk. She never agrees.\\" And later on in a conversation with a love interest, he tells her, \\"That's a pretty strong opinion,\\" and she responds, \\"I don't know how to have any other kind.\\" When Ifemelu decides to shut down her popular blog on race, a fan writes to her, \\"You've used your irreverent, hectoring, funny and thought-provoking voice to create a space for real conversations about an important subject.\\"<br /><br />All of this feels a little too self-congratulatory and masturbatory. Later on in the novel, one of the secondary characters delivers a monologue about how brave someone would have to be to write a novel about race in contemporary America (nudge-nudge). Furthermore, the critiques of race issues in this novel (such as the extensively-developed argument against the pressures for African and African-American women to treat their hair with chemicals), while important, seem preachy, simplistic, and unoriginal.<br /><br />I haven't read any of Adichie's other long works, but I imagine that if she turned her attention to a character in whom she saw a little less of herself, I would enjoy it. As far as \\"Americanah\\" goes, it felt sort of like a ten-hour road trip with a deeply self-involved friend.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|So easy to install and use. It is a must have if you read a lot and want to carry your tablet and leave your kindle at home.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My granddaughter showed me this and I have enjoyed the puzzles very much.  The way they progress adds an element of difficultly that keeps it interesting. I heartily recommend it to thinkers everywhere.

B0012YYZYK|3.0|Im a hardcore Zeppelin fan and so is my dad. I bought this for him for fathers day thinking this will be the most epic dvd he owns since he would always tell me about when he saw this movie in theaters and when him and his friends had nothing to do, they would go to the theater to go see Zeppelin. Well the picture is AMAZING! Its so clear! And the audio is crisp and pristine. The only negative I have is that they edited songs out of the concert. I don't know if because they couldn't transfer those clips over or what but one of my favorite songs got cut out (The Ocean) and both my dad and I noticed the editing. =/ other than that this movie/concert shows you the raw energy and talent of the greatest rock n roll band that is Led Zeppelin.
0802473164|3.0|Good book for men's bible study. Helped me to be a better spouse. Will read again and practice what I learned.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully written book and John Green is a very talented author... When I got to the end, I thought that maybe, just maybe if I turned the page there would be more. Makes you really question some of the most mundane and commonly accepted practices in our world.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|I was expecting the Disney story but expanded. This is a collection of short stories about animals, and the Mowgli, Bagheera, and Baloo story was only the first one.  Interesting but not amazing.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|Well I'd give it a higher rating if it didn't crash out every time I tried to input a profile name, tap options, tap play. Just plain tap the screen. Poof right back to the main screen.
B003XRELEI|3.0|Not his best, but decent read.  Very unusual writing style which I find always captivates me.  While the story line ins kind of kooky, his commentary on life, history, and the revelations of his own life are extremely interesting.  Read the book, take a leak, and reflect on yourself.
125000098X|5.0|I am almost done with the third book in the Clifton Chronicles and I love the series. A good mix of villians and heroes and interesting plot lines
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Well written, unique and creative world and character development.<br />Several unexpected twists and turns.<br />I bought the 2nd book right away and am looking forward to the 3rd in the series.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|Years in the making in the Philippines, endless editing, rewriting, and revisioning, Apocalypse Now Redux is Francis Ford Coppola's tour de force. At over 3 hours long, the Redux version has the added scenes of the French plantation and the Playboy bunnies in the rainy encampment, as well as a few other shorter scenes. These scenes don't really change the movie, but add to the richness of the whole experience. The sound track is amazing as well, with music by The Doors and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, and it can be edgy or ethereal.<br /><br />I had to read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, upon which the movie was loosely based for a Core course in college, and then see Apocalypse Now. Being a young, sensitive, idealistic gal, this was not my cup of tea. However, as an adult, this is my second favorite movie of all time, behind Blade Runner, and I find myself watching it over and over. Both the original cut and the Redux are great, but I like Redux a lot better. Recently, I have tried to reread Heart of Darkness and can't quite seem to plow my way through it. Did he get paid by the word? We quote the movie on a regular basis as well.<br /><br />Young Martin Sheen is amazing. It's hard to tell whether or not he is acting. Robert Duvall is iconic in his role as Colonel Kilgore. Marlon Brando is completely over-rated for his 2 days on the set. Look for a very young Larry Fishburne, now Laurence Fishburne.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now Redux has a well-deserved, significant place in our modern culture. Please read what other reviewers and wikipedia have said about the movie, as well as the original cut, because there really is some well-written descriptions and insight on it. This movie is definitely worth owning and watching often.
B003HKN52A|5.0|Is there anything more to say?  I do not believe there was ANYTHING Elvis ever did was pure ELVIS.  This is it.  I went to see the Elvis on Tour when it came close to our town.  A wonderful thing to see.  If you do not have this DVD, GET IT.  You will not be disappointed.<br />kakvan

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Worked better than I thought. I don't know how many uses I will get out of it, but for 8 bucks I can buy a few. I will be ordering a few more to put in my vehicles and hunting bag.
B003QO8TDC|4.0|I grew up around Pittsburgh in the tail end of its days as a steel producing powerhouse and visited periodically as the rust set in, and  I never saw it as beautiful or even photographic until I saw this film. The most beautiful thing in town in this film is the striking (and very young) Jennifer Beals. Somehow her charm overcomes the complete absurdity of the film's premise and a good deal of many of the less-than-appealing supporting characters, who frankly seem more typical of Pittsburgh than Beals herself. I suspend what I know about the setting and life and enjoy Beals, the dance performances, and the simple premise of the winning long shot at success by someone with a lot of strikes against her. Leave your mind at the door and focus on the eye candy.

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My granddaughter and I loved it, I bought it for her to watch on my kindle fire while I was working and she sat down and watched the whole thing and she is only 2 and half years old. It kept her interest, after I was done working I watched it myself great movie!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is by far the best, most consistantly excellent show that I can remeber watching.  It's TV on a higher level...
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|It might be a free ap, but you have to buy coins and I'm just NOT Going to do that! The bow was hard to get used to but ok in the end. I think I'm just going to delete the ap, tired of struggling. Sorry.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I looooove this movie all the actors were great and the end will make you CRY I GUARANTEE you'll fall in love with the concept and feel like you personally know the actors WATCH.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book attempts to prove there is a heaven.  I already believe there is one.  It was an interesting read but went on and on a bit much about the same things.  It did not say anything that has not been written before.  For example, when the author was in heaven there was no mention of seeing any of his friends or loved ones who had gone before  him.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It is his best work.  Keep tissues handy, it is filled with emotion that allows you to intimately get to know the characters.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This is a useful product for travel planning and just exploring possible travel locations. Usually check several travel online sources when making plans.
0811874192|5.0|I first bought this as a Mother's Day gift that would never wilt. Shortly after that we found out a beloved coworker at my school would be leaving soon. I immediately ordered another copy and passed it around with colorful Sharpies for everyone to write a message in and over 50 people wrote sentiments in the pages at the bases of the pop up flowers. It was a unique card and gift that will always be appreciated. I now have 3 more tucked away to give in the future!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I truly and utterly enjoyed reading this book although or even more it definitely is not some light reading.<br />It is a \\"difficult\\" book with rough edges and an oppressive undertone; simply a book about the real world.<br />I am sure this is a book one can just love or hate without anything in between, however I can only recommend to give it a try!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Every part of The Room is amazing! The music, the graphics, the puzzles, all of it! I can't wait for the next game! Don't keep us waiting too long.
1609613937|5.0|This &#34;new&#34; idea of actually being able to eat all the potatoes, oats, corn, rice & pasta has me wondering why I haven't heard of this before.  I grew up on potatoes & oats & corn and had a very healthy life.  I always thought I could or should be a vegetarian.  Now I have a reason to live without meat, dairy & fats in all forms.  My osteoarthritis had me incapacitated and in just 2 days of following &#34;The Starch Solution&#34;  I could move again.  After 4 weeks I have lost 10 lbs.  I have a new lifestyle now.  Very informative.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I've only used the device once so far but it worked great.  I charged it several days before I left town and used it a week later and still had all 4 bars of charge.  I'd give it a five but I've already lost my iphone charger connector via the drawstring bag.  I wish the bag that holds the device and connectors had a zipper on it instead.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is very page turning book that will get you thinking about the book. I would not change a thing about the way the book is written in style.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The story of a family that made a monumental decision by adding a member to the family.  Great story line as well as valid information regarding a certain sort of adoption.

B008602KQI|4.0|I love the book and the movie is pretty good too.<br />Fast shipping I  received the hunger games earlier than expected. If you haven't read the book I recommend you do!
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Great game lots of fun to play and really takes thought and strategy to defeat toy defense 1 is much harder
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An amazing effort in storytelling. Best of anything TV has to offer.  We want more please!  This is truly must see tv.
B00DGNOMB6|1.0|Disappointing boring movie.  Expected something more engaging and somewhat less geriatric.  I don't know the point of the movie. One star
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I got this for my husband because he would have the volume on the TV so loud you couldn't hear anything.  He uses this when he watches TV and the volume is now at a reasonable level.  The only problem is that when you're not using it you have to take the battery out or you're putting a new battery in every day.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show.  Can't wait for next season.  Wish this last show did not have such a shocking ending.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Reviewing anything that depends on taste is always subjective. Let me put it this way -- if you like this kind of music you should buy this. My only regret is that the auto-rip service isn't available on this as of this writing.  As to review of the actual music -- Stephen Holden of the NY Times already did a far better job than I can. Part of the review is on Salvant's Amazon store page, or find the original. Either way, listen to the samples. If you like what you hear you will not be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another Gaiman success - I was sad when it ended.  There much of childhood we forget - the innocence, the terror, the wonder, and the magic. This fantasy takes us there and so much further.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|On my kindle fire I have really cool games. Most of them aren't like this. If I could I would give this app 100 stars!!! If people are looking for an awesome app they should choose this one. P.S. This my favorite game to play!!!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|While impatiently awaiting the next season of GoT, I decided to start reading the books. I was not disappointed. They give greater depth to an already well woven tale.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I was able to get this set up quickly with my Hp officejet pro 8600. I had already set up the email account for my printer so I understood what the app was asking me for in the setup. my first attempt I was able to print a recipe but it cut off part of the page including the text. the print quality is not great either. looks like a poorly rendered scan of the web page. I'll play around a bit more but not really impressed so far.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Eh, it's a sequel, so I guess I wasn't expecting too much. It was an enjoyable rental even if not as inventive as the first. One of the key plot points was a totally predictable play on transphobic stereotypes, but with a comedy aimed at guys in the flyover part of the country I was not surprised to find that type of humor.<br /><br />The thing that ruined it for me was the photo sequence at the end. The photos were funny until the very last photo, which mocked a famous photo of an atrocious war crime. Seeing a restaging of \\"General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon\\" as the very last moment of the movie completely defeated the point of watching an 1 1/2 of escapist silly drivel. Now my spouse is in the other room crying ... thanks guys.
B0094M4OW0|5.0|Action, comedy.....it's one of the best movies. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a perfect team for this movie. I give it two thumbs up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the availability with my Prime membership.  The ONLY thing I don't like is having to wait 6 months to find out what happens  now!
B009Y61ZMI|5.0|In my opinion this is one of Kurt Russell's best movies.  It is done with great eye for detail.  For the time it was done and before some of the other Science Fiction/Outer Space movies were made the cinematography was fantastic.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Love the game. It is simple and fun. Kind of like playing Risk in space. Well worth the download.  Takes about 10 minutes to play small size map.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|An addictive game with enough challenges to play for many hours, yet each part of a course can be played separately if you only have a short break.  Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome but they should have a vaccum that sucks up minions I think it will be better game
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|... But you have be able to get over the fact that this kid is not an attorney and everyone is okay with breaking the law. Its a stretch and pretty much a needless one. They could have just made the story around him being an attorney but from a B-rate university since the firm only hires Harvard grads (which you never want to do unless you want a handful of overinflated egos and not that much personality or talent in your entire office) and hidden that fact from the group. There are interesting enough story lines to keep you watching.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|After years of feeling unworthy, love patience and understanding  breaks down that barrier and the language of flowers plays a pivotal  in bouquets of healing.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|Daniel Pinks ideas are certainly something that deserves a great deal of consideration. Perhaps a whole minded paradigm is dawning. It is probably due to my mind being anchored in my left brain, that I felt that this book suffers from the scourge of the age--opinions dressed up as facts.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Was hooked by first episode with story line and favorite actors. Great to be able to watch the next episode without waiting for a week to pass to find out what happens like prime time.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am totally hooked on this series.  I lurched three seasons @ the same time.  I will be purchasing more soon.
B00AEFXXMI|4.0|I agree with Keith Simanton's review that this movie, although still fun, hasn't aged gracefully. Despite some iconic moments (like the hilarious stunt with dad's prized car), much of the movie seems dated, and more specifically, tied to the 80s. Of course it is an 80s flick, and much of the charm is its nostalgia for that period. Broderick is still appealing as the hapless teenager who's hoped-for fun day off playing hooky blows up in his face. The 80s and fads like disco music, bands like Abba, and other 80s phenoms are long gone but if you look back fondly on those sort of 80s things you might like this movie.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am definitely a fan, I am totally hooked on this series.  I purchased the first three series all @ once,I am due for more.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is a typical tycoon game.  Nothing special.  I do find it more enjoyable than other tycoon games I have played, like Oregon Trail for Kindlefire.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am finished with my third season, I perched three at once.  I am hooked and will be making additional purchases.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun on my kindle fire. Really good use of an hour or so. Not difficult but entertaining. More rooms please!
B00CW665VI|4.0|a fresh approach in romance seeing things from the eyes of a man. Drew is cute and well, taylor id fierce.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I first started this series when I picked up a book that looked promising at the grocery checkout. Such an &#34;exquisite&#34; story, as Thom would say! When I knew this last book was out, I started from the beginning, and have read all fourteen together. The writing by both authors is fabulous. Mr. Sanderson did an excellent job of completing Mr. Jordan's epic vision when the world lost him. The triumph of good over evil, with human frailties and faults -- the best story around!!  I recommend this series to everyone.
B003G4W49C|4.0|While the concepts were great and the action good, the characters were less compelling than in other novels, perhaps because the main characters were children and maybe have a smaller range of emotions and outlets.  While I enjoyed the book, I did not feel compelled to read others in this series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried and grateful for the story at the same time. Read it. A sadness that you wish you could change but glad they experienced what they did.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was wonderful just like the first full of imagination and imagery. It did get slow for a bit but bounced back with action and twists and turns. Can't wait to start book 3!!!
B004XANKVO|5.0|This book bag is the best I've ever owned.  It has a ton of space for a weekend's worth of clothing and your laptop with all it's accessories.  It's very well built and looks like it will last you a long time.  I love it!
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|Love this writer - anything he writes.  Wonderfully thought out plots, well written and informative, yet easy to read and hard to put down.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|No woman likes the way she looks. This movie touches on a woman's view of her own looks and her inability to see past her own prejudicial vision. Jeff Bridges plays a brilliant professor who decides that love is ruined by sex. He convinces Barbra Streisand to marry him and live in a platonic relationship based on friendship. Neither plan on falling in love and it is that messy emotion that forces both to realize that they have so much to offer each other and that the world does not see us as we see ourselves. This is one of Barbra's best movies ever.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Excellent movie with characters that you can relate to .  It shows that there are opportunities for second chances and it doesn't matter how old one is, love matters.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was hot and yummy. I do get a little tired of Eva run in  away all the time by  other than that this  book  is steamy.
0307716988|4.0|Haven't read the book yet but I wanted to give the product a review in terms of packaging and product expectation.<br /><br />First, I was a bit disappointed that the cover itself that we see on the listing's pictures aren't actually part of the book. It is part, but you can detach it from the book. Although that's only a detail, it is kind of misleading, unless I didn't look at the pictures carefully.<br />Like I said, it is a detail. The book itself is very well made, the real cover is a red hard cover with Michael's authentic signature on it. It is very nice. On the side, it is written gold (color gold of course) on black the title of the book and the author's name of course:<br />\\"MOONWALK<br />MICHAEL JACKSON\\"<br />Overall, it is a good product.<br />Can't say if it is a good book because I haven't read it yet.<br />However, I already had good expectation for it even before buying, let's hope I'm not wrong!<br />About the packaging itself, it is very well package, simple but efficient, no waste.<br />It is simply wrapped by a simple piece of cardboard.
1442366621|1.0|I was disappointed with this item, I thought I was ordering a hard cover book, I opened the package and thought , nice I don't have to read it, it will read it for me and i can see the pic and receipes at the same time.... &#34;WRONG&#34;  I played it on my computer and was disgusted but I guess its too late because I opened it and threw out the bag it was delivered in ..
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We found it to be quite e  ntertaining...with a message...now we can watch the sequel and know the background, yahoo!
B005DD7H50|5.0|The 'insight' into the condition of reality was quite the ride, and makes the relevance of proper motivation readily apparent. I especially enjoyed the fact that the effect no longer required the drug after the proper synapses had formed within the brain, allowing for independence from possible manipulation by others. Great flick!
B00687PWQG|5.0|After all these years, we finally watched the whole series. So wonderfully done. Lots to discuss & mull over after every episode.
B004MPESSY|4.0|Always nice to see the victim come out on top, although some of the scenes were rather 'contrived', and lacked credibility.
B000784WMW|4.0|I enjoyed Timothy Dalton in this role - the film production with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg is far far better, but as a 1980's production goes, this is good.  Zillah Clark is very sincere in her performance in Jane Eyre and it is a very compelling production.<br /><br />I still want to get the William Hurt Charlotte Gainsbourg production one day - can't be shipped to Zimbabwe!
B00CATSONE|5.0|the book describes what differentiates a genius from a commoner and in particular, the very perseverance character of Tesla what made him who he was. It is very helpful to be reminded that it depends on us whether we can survive all the ups and downs in life. Great reading, I keep reading it over and over to keep myself motivated. Highly recommended!!!
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the production that made me fall in love with literature.  I saw it as a child and from that time on took an interest in literature and now teach it.<br /><br />I think Elizabeth Garvie was the best Elizabeth Bennett ever - David Rintoul as Darcy is a bit wooden, but this is a lovely production - I especially like the way that the early BBC productions used authentic candlelight for the evening scenes - it really shows what  evenings were like in the 19th Century.<br /><br />I'm very glad I found it and was able to add it to my collection.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I've loved Charlie Chaplin my entire life.  Now I'm introducing him to my children.  This bio was great and informative.
B006S080DK|3.0|This movie was o-k.  Not really what I expected.  I certainly didn't expect to see Helena Bonham Carter buck naked on top of a guy.  Looked like a cave woman.  I guess it was made before bikini waxes were popular.  :(
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I'm giving this one only 3 stars b/c It keeps freezing up & I have to restart my Kindle. I think the game is very fun & it's exactly what i was looking for. But the way it freezes up all the time is very frustrating & annoying, it makes me not even want to bother playing it. I hope it gets straightened out so that I can enjoy the game! I'm gonna keep it around for a bit & see if it gets resolved..but if nothing gets fixed soon I'll probably be deleting the app. :/
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I can't put my finger on it but this book felt different than the others.  Sad to see a couple familiar characters meet their demise but it does add a touch of realism to the story.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Great period piece & excellent drama<br />I enjoyed it immensely. Acting is very good as is character development. Really loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son says this is an awesome game. He enjoys getting coins and finding ways to get to the next level. He does say he wishes it were not so expensive to get an extra horse.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I'm not the type to like legal dramas, but the premise of this show intrigued me. I was very surprised by the amount of humor this show delivers.  I really enjoyed this season
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Yanni's transformation for adding some lyrics is beautifully composed. But with Yanni, There's never Less, It's always<br />Over and Above what he puts his heart and soul into, to share with the World. Excellence In Motion.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie is great for when friends come over that get squeamish during horror movies. It's more comedy than horror.
B00005M989|5.0|I had been wanting to order this CD for quite a while and just decided to do it. It arrived in perfect shape.  It also has all of the Prince songs that I love to hear.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This is a good movie with a lot of action with the Character involved Michael douglas with a good pace .
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Its a shame it took 42 years for this to get released. This is excellent. Its a must have for Who fans.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|This film is realistic and reflects todays sad state of affairs and society  in America  Michael douglas does a well done performance of a middlle aged white man down on his luck losing his job and marriage problems and gets revenge on society,is well done with action through out the film which is very well done. Highly recommended ,
B00005AFLS|5.0|There was a mistake made when Sanctury brought out the remastered version of Brain Salad Surgery catalog number CMRCD201. They pulled the wrong master tapes. This version is the first version that was never released previously, ELP decided to rerecord it later which is the version we all know and love. This version is kind of like hearing demo tapes, close but not what was eventually released. Later Sanctuary went back and did it right. That is catalog number SMRCD059. I recommend seeking out the CMRCD201 version if you like this album.
B00186DV1U|5.0|Love the sense of humor his character brings to life. He and Renee Russo have amazing chemistry. My 12 yr. old twins love this movie. They have become huge  Clint fans. We watch it over and over!
B009E3EY38|5.0|The Blu-Ray of the concert is excellent. The songs are played closer to the original as opposed to being drawn out and altered as was the case of Zep shows in the 70's. Highly recomended
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It's a progressive game.  Witches brew pot contains the bubbles you can use to toss to like colored bubbles.  The more bubbles tossed in the multible pots earn different scores.  Get them all in the pots and you can move forward to more challenging games.  Warning:  Very Addictive!
B002M3GPOI|5.0|if you like In the Court of the Crimson King you need this box set. With several different versions it leaves no stone unturned.
B00935KWWO|4.0|When my other FaceBook app was having some issues on my Kindle Fire HD, I downloaded this one and it's just great!  I'm able to to review all my columns as set on my computer, reply, see photos, go to links, etc.  It's always nice to have an alternate way to access FaceBook!
B00742F4W6|5.0|This one was hard to come by due to rarity. If you can find it get it. I'm glad I was able to track it down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Allows me to stay connected to my auctions anytime, anywhere. Great for buyers and sellers. Easy to navigate and has allowed me to snipe several items while away  from my pc.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|just ok  prefer to play on pc than on device. i was not over that top excited it is just ok.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Can't wait to finish the series!  Love the character interaction and the unusual challenges they face.  Really a creative series.
0545586178|5.0|This book is just amazing. I love how this one gets more political and even the twists and turns. Every page is just a cliff hanger. This book is a must read, along with the series as a whole. And after watching the trailer for of the movie being based off this.....holy smokes batman. This is going to be epic!!!
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Great game design. Solitaire that keeps you playing to best your score and earn 3 stars. Includes a gopher just annoying enough that you want to best him too. Addictive, love it!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider Solitaire is more difficult to master than some solitaire games.  If you get bored easily with simple solitaire why not spice things up with this great game and challenge yourself.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great free game, it is nice that you don't have to spend money to continue through the game. Both my son and I play together.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I've been a huge 'Castle' fan since the very beginning, (I followed Nathan Fallon over from 'Firefly') and I must admit that this season is the best. Simply because, in the beginning we see Castle as the cocky, self-absorbed novelist who is more interested in having fun than working. All of these qualities are awesome because it shows him, and the other characters, as they were before all the sub plots of the series started taking over the main characters actions.<br /><br />In this season, Castle is just interested in getting a good story and bugging the hell out of Beckett. Ryan and Espizeto are just working stiff cops trying to do their job around what, at first appears to be just a big distraction. And Beckett is bound and determined to not let the attention of one of her favorite authors distract her from solving murders. Oh, and it's clear right from the start that she's totally hiding her attraction to Rick, no matter how much she complains. It's a case of, 'me thinks the lady doth protest to much'.
0062255657|3.0|Gaiman seems very much to be trading on his name in The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It's a quick, solid little fairy tale, with some genuinely creepy bits, but overall, it falls flat. And my main critique is that, of all the incredibly interesting story lines and points of view available to him, Gaiman took the least interesting one.<br /><br />In part, this is due to Gaiman's over-reliance on the \\"nebbish young man falls into/discovers magical world\\" trope. It works in some of his novels - Neverwhere and Stardust, for example - when he gives himself enough space to flesh out the stakes and the world. But he doesn't give himself that space here, and so everything seems to happen just because it is A Fairytale and Strange Things Happen in Fairytales.<br /><br />The characterization here is also stilted - the way characterization often is in fairy tales. Gaiman's choice to not give the narrator a name is an odd one, and, since he's your YA fantasy stock \\"bookish child without many friends,\\" the lack of name makes him even harder to really get into.<br /><br />However, the narrator's scenes with the Hempstocks, particularly Lettie, are superb. And Gaiman has rendered something truly delightful with these three women; unfortunately, given the short length of the book and the limited knowledge of Gaiman's narrator, we end up knowing very little (and suspecting much) about the Hempstocks, their history, and their magic. I suppose for some, this will increase the sense of wonder in this book. To me, it felt lazy and like Gaiman didn't actually care enough to flesh out this book, its world, and its characters to a fuller extent.<br /><br />Bookending the novel with the adult narrator's perspective also felt lazy; the ending felt cheap, and the message (I suppose) that childhood is a realm of wonder and terror which an adult can never fully recover is trite. Framing the novel with the adult narrator's comments, frankly, added nothing to the book, and this is a book that could stand to have a lot added to it.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is an enjoyable - and quick - read. But if you're hoping for something more like American Gods, Neverwhere, or even the Graveyard Book, you'll be disappointed by this slight thing.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|I love superman especially Christopher reeve charm and captivating performance, this superman lacks that. I personally think Brandon routh was a better fit just bad script,this superman is dark and brutal without the charm ,comedy or cleverness of originals. For example superman trying to keep his identity from Lois and her crazy antics trying to prove he was gone she knows from beginning , superman outsmarting zod and his flunkies when odds were against him gone. General zod in this one seems like a recovering junkie terrible ,Jor el  not as good as Marlon brando even the charm of the Kent's was lost in this movie and way to dark this is not batman. Also where are superman's quirky but brilliant comments. Very disappointed
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved MacGyver when it aired on TV many years ago and I loved watching the episodes again.  He was very creative and a really good looking man.  There were problems with the streaming, however and I would sometimes have to restart the show 5 or 6 times which was very frustrating.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|This Superman is way to dark and Brandon routh was better closer to original Christopher reeve. General zod is a recovering junkie with laryngitis, jor el wasn't as distinguish as Marlon Brando, Superman Henry lacked charm and prescence that was exuded by reeve and even to a lesser extent Brandon. This was dark and brutal like batman ,not the smart clever funny originals. Too much cgi,movie has no personable characters,just leaves you feeling empty. can do much better Warner bros guaranteed.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful writer, better than many I have read. But it is not as good as his &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;, which I rate 5 stars. Although everything, in Mountains, comes together in the end, the chapters jump around and the reader must stop to figure out just where the characters are at this point. Confusing.
0064430227|5.0|We have tons of kids books and read handfuls everyday, so this one was very refreshing in that it was soooo different from the other ones we owned.  It is very original and creative.  The illustrations are extremely simple though. There is one part about a dragon though guarding an apple tree that scared my child at first, so we just emphasized, he is guarding the yummy apples for Harold and that seemed to help.  I'm very glad I decided to order this book.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Every once in a while a show comes out with fantastic characters, ideas and imagination, and Eureka was it.<br /><br />Sadly, it is also true that  shows like this earn a following TV execs don't appreciate as much as they as should and the show was cancelled sort of unresolved! Scifi is a unique crowd, but a HUGE crowd!<br /><br />Every season was clever, creative and well done!  Super entertaining and you fall in love with all the characters!<br /><br />Sorry it was cancelled, but so glad it is on Amazon Prime!
0679809015|5.0|Great lift the flap book as long as you don't mind how teeny tiny it is.  My child has always loved this book though, so I would definitely recommend.  Its an easy one to through in the diaper bag.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I like this game cuz I is like u r in an actual town but on a kindle kindle I love it
B00DHNJCKQ|2.0|ZZZzzzz, movie could not keep me interested or even awake for that matter.  Lost interest in all the characters about 1/3 into the movie.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I am bout to delete the app cuz I never play it cuz it doesn't do me well and I don't get it
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi was a good and interesting read for me but I found the first 1/3 of the book as almost boring but it picked up after that point and became very interesting.
B00DFFHUUA|2.0|Is the Rock going to be in the next Hobbit, Star Wars and Harry Potter movie also? It seems like Follywood has decided to put him in every other movie franchise on the big screen. Maybe they should try better casting and character development instead. What a letdown.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|I thought the plot was a good one. THe acting was really well done. I'm a big Colin Farrell fan.
0345803485|5.0|Great book according to my wife. Now she just keeps me busy on lets do these lets do that so is ok with me. Hope she find more books like these.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|The decision to purchase this album couldn't be simpler.  Simply listen to the 6th song, Soulcrusher - all of it, not a sample.  Your ears will either be begging for death or begging for more.<br /><br />I always thought the search for the next great singer is pointless since there's a 100,000-way tie for first place.  It's really not that hard.  But Kraller's effortless power, emphasis on effortless, inspired the whole band to go much farther than they've ever been.  Xandria before this album is not worth your time.  But this album might be the most ferocious and intense in the history of music.<br /><br />The composing is a little flat and blocky - no Tuomas Holopainens here.  But not a whit of epicness is lost because of that.  And though the album softens a bit at the end, as such albums typically do, it does so organically.  The experience as a whole is like an early explorer going through a mountain range.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Wonderful little holster. A must have for anyone that carry a 5 to 7 inch flashlight.  Very durable.  Would recommend it to anyone
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle Fire 32 kept stopping so I would have to turn it off and back on. Now I just clean it with Clean Master and it is good to go. It only takes about 10 seconds for the procedure, so I am happy with it.
0345803507|5.0|Great book according to my wife. Now she just keeps me busy on lets do these lets do that so is ok with me. Hope she find more books like these.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|There are some great puzzles here. Not so obvious that you figure it out easily. And, there's a method to the maze that you can follow. It was short though it took me 8-10 sessions to get through it. I can now watch and guide my 5 year through it. It's far too complex for a young child to understand, but it's a great puzzle to walk them through.  I am amazed at the thought put into each step.  This is one of the best puzzle games I've played.
0345803493|5.0|Great book according to my wife. Now she just keeps me busy on lets do these lets do that so is ok with me. Hope she gind more books like these.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It was a fresh take on the zombie, apocalyptic future kind of a theme. I think I will watch it again sometime, I enjoyed some of the metaphors of how people turn when they loose all hope.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Despicable me is such a great breath of fresh air to the modern family is just looking to spend time together and watch a funny and uplifting story. Not only is it very very funny but all the characters have deep stories that allow everyone to get involved and get connected to each each one of them. You will enjoy this movie with your family units are just watching it by yourself it's still a great movie to watch.
1878424319|5.0|The wisdom expressed in this book was life changing and blew my mind. It gave me a whole other perspective on looking at relationships and life in general.
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved the series but hated that amazon made me pay 1.99 for each episode of the last season even though I am a prime member..
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|You can feel the energy of the movie both positive and negative. Most of all you can feel the love of a dad for his son and wife.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|There are many on meds it seems today with a lot of mental problems and this movie was great to show the obstacles that families go through.. Never been a movie like this one.. Awesome..
B000FC0V3E|3.0|The way these people lived their lives was sad.  No one seemed to truly enjoy life.  Time was spent indulging themselves in whatever they chose to do.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|Great compilation of soundtrack music as it's heard in the Movie. If you like the movie and felt the scenes of the movie when or where each track was heard ? This is definitely the mix of music you want to hear over and over!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app is amazing, but it would be nice if it was gamepad compatible and a 3rd multiplayer option using Bluetooth.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I dig what this app is doing for me, I just feel like it could be done in a more straight forward easy to  undestand way. Less aesthetic,more simplicity.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Super fun and worth it for being g a free game. Graphics are awesome and the enemies are challenging. Get it!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Heard Lorde briefly on public radio and loved Royals.  Researched her using the key words; 16 year old pop star New Zealand and it worked.  Her voice is beautiful and her music is meaningful, even though she's so young.  I would definitely recommend her album to a friend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Title says it all~ :D Its simply what the game implies but the missions keep you hooked. It is surprisingly addicting.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Hard to do. Have to be persistent! I had my 8 year old grandson help me with it. Oh the glory of the young!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The app is super fun and super easy to use. I like that you can play it without having to spend real money to get the &quot;good stuff&ldquo;.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Fun and challenging! It is simple to understand! It was recommended by one of my friends! I will download the paying version!
B009IF82SK|5.0|Who doesn't love BBT? I don't have cable and Amazon makes it possible for me to watch it, in HD, even! For a 30 minute sitcom, it's a bit better than average.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Our grandchildren love this app! It is challenging and fun! No violent action and a &#34;clean&#34; app! Glad I got it!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|A  band with a unique sound.<br />Lead vocalist makes this a great album.<br />They are on tour this summer,  Try to see them live
B007MCTTHY|5.0|this app is extremely fun and addicting. i sort of thought it was lame at first but it grows on you and gets addicting
B009NOVCTM|4.0|Other than the 2 new songs, &#34;One More Shot&#34; and &#34;Doom and Gloom&#34;  the music on here most Stones fans have already on the individual albums.<br />It is more a second set of greatest hits starting with the  Some Girls album in 1978.<br />Ge the individual albums to  hear all the other great music that did not make it on here.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie is AWESOME.<br />It doesn't have any flashy young actor or superhero or robots or zombies and YET it made my day.<br />I love all the actors : Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, John Milkovich.<br />When they all come together on the screen they made magic....<br />It was pure FUN
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Fast paced and tightly plotted. I was curious<br /> to see if Tom Clancy could make eco-terrorism<br /> work as the plot line. He makes it work quite<br /> well. This book is well worth your time.
B006T9PI5I|5.0|Oldie but a goodie. Classic old movie. Why cant new movies have this kid of imagination any more. Good movie
B004B8BFSI|3.0|Slow moving and dull dialogue, what there is of it.  Clooney seems to be walking though it.  No one else of note in the film.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Says it would work but doesn't They need to supply more instructions instead of just a general install information. Not worth the time
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Outstanding as a personal narrative and also as a perspective on Americsn race relations from a non-American. Well-written and engrossing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looking forward to season 4!!!!<br />very addictive plot, kept me interested through all the episodes even I knowing how it ended.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The good wife never seems to disappoint. Each week brings a new court drama, while the ongoing back stories remain rich and compelling. Shocked its not the number one show on tv!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|i can not figure out how to link it to my facebook account and i do not want to start all over
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Had to wait for it to be released but it was worth it.  Oddly enough, Amazon has found ever so many other books along the same line for me to buy.  How do you suppose they do that?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game for me and my daughter can bond and enjoy this time with this horse . Its a wonderful game and tea he's you to keep the animals well treated and well balanced.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This CD does not disappoint....his smooth voice is as good as ever! If you love Darius Rucker, this CD is a must.
0670014893|5.0|You have a young whistleblower who decides to publicly disclose a failed security operation and faces its aftermath. You also have a young ex contractor whistleblower who decides to go public about the security state whcih nobody seems to like and is stranded in Moscow, while the whole U.S. executive branch goes for a world-wide manhunt which includes forced landing of a private jet carrying the head of a South American state.<br /><br />Now, which is more realistic/believable? Which sounds more likely? And which is more John le Carre? After a few decades since the end of the cold war, the world is finally catching up with le Carre.
B004UPANAI|3.0|The graphics were not worthy of this storyline. enjoy the actors but the plot was thin.  trying to capture Wolverine's emotional ties with his present life and his past is hard to mix in an action fest type film.  I enjoyed watching but disappointed in the photography and the plot. My review is Semi watch Hope better for the next one.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love this series.  It just goes to show you don't need a big budget to make an entertaining show.  You need strong characters and a good story.  It's impressive how they have tied together the long story arc involving River Song and the doctor's latest demise.<br /><br />I'm really pleased I can catch it on Amazon Prime, since I can't seem to get it anywhere else.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Fantastic tale of discovering religion, family, survival and passing these lessons on to others. The cinematography and animal scenes are superb.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I have been hoping for a long time to find a series to keep my attention in the way &#34;Lost&#34; did..sitting at the edge of my seat! &#34;Fringe&#34; almost does that but not quite. Agent Olivia Dunham is daring and full of adventure. No risk seems to great in her search for truth. She doesn't think twice about her own personal danger. Dr. Walter Bishop appears a genius with his knowledge of the bizarre when it comes to what can be and has been discovered in the lab. Never far beneath the surface is the thus far unacknowledged love interest between Olivia and Peter, Walter's son. Massive Dynamic - a huge, powerful, and incredibly controlling corporation, is shrouded in darkness while appearing to be light.<br /><br />Only halfway through Season 1, there is a long way to go before the series conclusion. There is much yet to discover. Why only four stars and not five? I am not quite sure - yet, and may change this rating in time. Suffice it to say, I am always glad there is another episode to come. Whatever will turn up next, and how, and where ... for surely something else of intrigue, danger and mystery lurks around the next corner. Watch out!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|great CD, totally typical Andrea Bocelli, we did not own one of his CD's, we find a little A.B. goes a long way, this is a terrifically representative of what he does, and does SO WELL, for when you want mushy fluff, + duets with Jennifer Lopez, Nelly Furtado, and in a time-travelin' trick, Edith Piaf !!!!  Memorable, fun, repeatable.  This is one worth owning.  Don't know we'll buy another, but very glad we did buy this one!
B008133MDK|5.0|Very captivating and suspense filled all the way...  Well filmed.  Never a dull moment.  Character development was done very creatively
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I can not express the gratitude I have for the wisdom and love of life this movie brings.  The Action, the cinematography, the plot, the switches of reality and time that bends around the lives of these characters are all enthralling compelling to watch.  The actors assuming the many facets of each characters different personalities and emotions was superb to watch as well as experience.  I want to implore all those who look for a review to decide whether to watch or not please read in my review that I wish for you not only to watch but to experience this movie's message as well as enjoy the action and sexy images of the characters.  My review is MUST WATCH NOW!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I probably didn't understand exactly what I was getting. I liked the idea of the game but ran out of all supplies while I was still learning -- frustrating. I don't want to play a game where I have to beg or buy items to continue play.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I liked all the historical references in this one. Glad to see Diana and Matthew's relationship formalized. Matthew's father gets the award for most interesting character in this one.
B007N85POS|5.0|I love angry birds, all of them are fun and this one is a good challenge with the monkeys and stuff in it
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were excellent and very captivating.  I actually read this book in one day as I didn't want to put it down.  I also just love this series.  If you start at the beginning, you get acquainted with all the characters and then understand better as a particular character or characters gets their own story.  Excellent historical romance.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Without being preachy, this movie champions people who prevail over psychological issues and interruptions.  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence virtually became the characters, totally believable while experiencing the many layers of life's interactions.  This is a feel good movie, with subtle, enhancing performances from Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the thrill of triumph when watching characters navigate through complicated and confusing lives.  5 stars!!!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|No matter where you come from things that are different often lead to the same Outcome.  Prejudice, indifference and bias judgments.  Even in a fantasy movie based on 2 worlds sharing the same space but different gravity fields.  I enjoyed the actors acting and the cinematography.  The Directing was capturing my attention, but the plot was predictable.  I enjoyed the fact they didn't go with a Shakespearean ending of Romeo and Juliet Style , but I liked the Happy ending.  Even-though truthfully no one is scrutinized as much as the director said they would be for interaction with opposite side personnel.  Watch as an experience but then watch Cloud Atlas for the experience of a lifetime.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great fun but was confusing for me when I started (maybe because I am past the age where this sort of thing is intuitive). However, I have learned how it works and am enjoying it too much!
B00065GX64|5.0|I won't speak to the merits of the film as others have so generously discussed. Rather, I want to commend the Criterion edition's audio commentary by Anton Kaes and Eric Rentschler. Without a doubt, this is the best dvd commentary I have come across in terms of elucidating a film's form in relation to its historical/social context. I tend to get bored with most dvd commentaries, finding a few useful tidbits here-and-there, but this commentary was quite the opposite. I couldn't stop taking notes, stopping and pausing along the way to re-think \\"M\\" or what I thought I knew about \\"M.\\" Don't ignore the bonus features on this one!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I really enjoy playing all the Zen Pinball games on my Kindle Fire.  I can't wait for more tables to come out.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|For many years I lived in Pakistan and India, so the beautiful country, interesting characters, and charming storyline were a delight to my senses.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This is a great movie . . . if you have a very low I.Q. or are just too tired to think.<br /><br />It is an unintentional self-parody.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Give me more of this actor.  His strength in his smile and wit captured my intriguing mind. The ability to express the culture of the Vikings timeline is wonderful.  The sadness is in knowing the outcome of this superstitious blind culture's downfall.  let the writers express a defeat worthy of watching as it has shown a victory of slaughter that made them rulers of their time. My review is a Watch. What do you ink?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best interactive puzzles since myst. Loved being absorbed into the whole vintage environment and steam punk- ish mechanisms...can't wait for next one!
193700788X|5.0|I love, love, love Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series. I have read each one and started these way before &#34;True Blood&#34; ever came around. I am sorry the book series is ending but Ms. Harris did it oh so very well and everything turned out exactly as I thought it would (and should). Love the fact that Sookie and Sam FINALLY ended up together. WOOHOO another winner Charlaine and thanks for all of the late night good reading !!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not much for soap operas.  But, this shows historical setting and location makes for a really great story.  All of the characters do a great job!!
B008J34466|4.0|Good songs!<br />Have not had any of Pink's cd's before. Glad I bought it.  Have it on my computer to listen while on line.
0062255657|1.0|After finishing this book, I am shocked at all of the 5 star reviews it has received. Nothing against those who enjoyed it, but this story just rubbed me the wrong way. First of all, I found it incredibly pretentious. Every page was oozing with high-brow, sophisticated words, phrases, and references that didn't create a thought-provoking experience, but an eye-rolling one. Looking past that, the story was beyond annoying. None of the fantasy elements presented in it were well explained or thought out, creating a confusing and frustrating read. None of the characters were three dimensional; the unnamed narrator's (a young child) voice sounded nothing like a kid's and he went off on random tangents on more than one occasion.<br />I really wanted to like this book, and I'm glad that most of the people who read it did, but I, however, did not. I almost couldn't get through it. Bottom line: plot is stupid, little to no explanations, writing style is pretentious. Waste of $12!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I did not think that I would like this series, but the actors do such a great job that I can't help but get sucked into the plot.
034580709X|4.0|Jo Nesbø's procedurals have earned high praise in his native Norway since his 1997 debut, but his work has dribbled into international markets, completely out of sequence. Nesbø's English-language publisher calls this \\"The First Harry Hole Thriller,\\" and it reflects its dated 1997 setting--we keep forgetting about the scarcity of cell phones or the early, sluggish Web. This gives it a naive quality almost like Agatha Christie.<br /><br />Nesbø distinguishes this thriller from the seemingly limitless interchangeable paperback mysteries with his laser-like focus on character. From the beginning, Harry shows a casual attitude toward procedure, playing his investigation by ear, openly chafing at rules and limitations. His finely-honed intuition leads him to remarkable moments of insight. His Columbo-like gift for \\"just one more question\\" repeatedly unlocks the right evidence at the right moment.<br /><br />But Harry offsets his finely honed investigative discernment with a self-destructive streak like the broad side of a barn. If he feels stymied in the first half, it's because he's trying to accommodate official channels. He starts winning against his enemy only when he puts himself in situations that could easily kill him. Criminal scum fears and respects Harry because he's mere inches removed from becoming one of them.<br /><br />Not that Harry wants to implode. He tries to do well, follow rules, make friends, and even court a woman. But he sabotages himself so thoroughly, we suspect he's doing it on purpose. The woman he loves is also a material witness, so their relationship skirts the law, especially when the killer spots her as Harry's greatest weakness. When the rules impede his investigation, he chooses results over process.<br /><br />Harry plays the perpetual outsider, asking questions that seem obvious to his colleagues. His unique perspective unblocks longstanding stalemates because he doesn't share others' blinders. Important clues lie in Aboriginal myths that the Australian characters have grown bored hearing, but which Harry encounters for the first time. He talks to people he doesn't know others ignore, and focuses on details others see as mere background.<br /><br />Nesbø's episodic style takes some getting used to. His very short chapters combine copious dialog and Harry's internal speculations into an atmosphere unlike typical American or British detective thrillers. Nesbø often introduces characters and details that appear tangential, not just at first, but for many chapters afterward. Only tenacious readers will realize how tightly constructed Nesbø's prose actually is.<br /><br />Harry Hole makes an intriguing character, and the parallel between his personal disintegration and his investigative success is a real eye-opener. Longtime Nesbø readers will welcome this addition to his translated canon. New fans will find this a good place to begin Harry's story.hs that the Australian characters have grown bored hearing, but which Harry encounters for the first time.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is yet another winner for James Rollins. I love his character Cotton Malone. I also like the fact that Mr. Rollins isn't afraid to write out the fringe characters just when you get used to them being in each plot. It keeps his plot lines fresh for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed it very much.  Movie was fantastic and actress was great.  Great story. I feel it would not be a waste of money to purchase either the book or movie.
B008OOYALE|4.0|In this game you hatch, grow, evolve, and breed dragons. The graphics are good but clearing space building items gets very expensive very fast. it will be a slow process without spending real money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a decent app. It like that it has multiple games that are orginial and easy to understand. i woild recommend it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The HD stream is very nice on my computer screen. That makes a big difference in quality. It is a good job.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love historical fiction and this book didn't disappoint.  Written in letters, it has a interesting style.  It did start slow to me, but then I couldn't put it down.  My favorite part of the book is how it told what it is what like to be on Guersey Island during WWII.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|A lot of fun in your spare time and no need for in game purchases to move to the next level!
B006VR65OQ|4.0|I was pleased with this movie.  It was based on overall computer rating and impressed me.  I use this method when I coach so I was already a believer in it.  By the way,  I did real well in coaching.  Do not knock this method until you try it awhile.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book that should be on must read list, especially for anyone working with children. Ot only fifth graders but the adults.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book gets you hooked from the beginning. It is fun, exciting, and heartbreaking all the way through. I would definitely suggest reading it.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|This book is so helpful and informative. It is not composed of abstract, vague, inapplicable statements about \\"making do\\" with curly hair but step-by-step, hands-on advice that allows curly girls to thrive in the glory of their curls. It is a must-have for anyone who has had a rogue wave or frizz-fright.  The embedded video clips in the Kindle version made this book an even better value.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Smartly written and acted, this series is entertaining if you don't think too much about the out-of-character actions, e.g. the smart guy doing dumb things, and the legal flaws
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was very good. But it surprised me in the end. I never expected Eva and Gideon's story to keep going. So happy it's not over yet but can't wait until the next book comes out. Hope I don't have to wait to long.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  It was an insult to the old movie.  Waste of money. Buy something else.
006114665X|3.0|The authors clearly went to extraordinary lengths to produce an insightful, in-depth, and unique analysis of the origins of World War I. However, the extremely detailed context they provide on many of the key developments leading up to war can be labored and tends to drastically slow down and occasionally misdirect the narrative. So, to me, anyway, the book is halfway between a popular history and an academic publication. It's an uneven but in many respects great book. Plus, if there is ever an award given for most uses of the word \\"irredentist\\" in one book, this one will win.
0812982622|5.0|This novel was absolutely outstanding and more than worthy of rewards received.  In depth look at North Korea from the author who went there.  Character development is very intricate, as is the story line. This is literature at its finest.<br />The culture comes alive with all the differences, fears and brainwashing.  Control of a people and gradual shifting of Jun Do and others' who come to understand their lives mean little.<br />This is a very deep read and one needs attention to detail. To fully enjoy and appreciate the subtleties.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This book was quick and fast paced, no drawing out of the story, just enough for a reader to want more, especially of Jack the detective. Looking forward to the next Lexy Baker!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|There are so many twists and turns! Just when you think you know what's next, another surprise turn comes along.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Love the fast and the furious, love it, love it and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I love it, never been a better movie series in a long  time!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|It is slow in updating and I believe I went to another app as this one left me desiring more from it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This new application is very confusing to use. It seems like they want you to get everything but the weather.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Only thing I do not like is after you take the picture and hit save, if you don't hit save/share it does not save the picture. :(
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is an impressive, and addictive show. The acting, the characters, the writing is all top notch! Thank you Amazon, for making my prime membership more worth it, every day!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this game but it is slow on my Kindle Fire and frustrating with my stylus.  Maybe just me.  However a very well done app and it was a very good price.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Pretty smarmy and generally unsurprising in terms of plot. I'll give it a couple of more episodes but I am unimpressed.
B006RXQ0JO|3.0|An average movie.  It was OK and that is my top rating. I am not sure I would recommend it to anyone, just OK&#62;
B0092S4WLY|4.0|it would be nice if there we some hints to click on when running. stuck instead of having to look on you tube for hints.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book !  A great lesson in what it means to be kind.  The characters come alive and you will keep them in your heart.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|A weird story of a kid that randomly has senseless events happen in his life and ends in further pointless events. Don't waste your time on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It is like Temple Run, but I like it better ... probably because they are so cute.  It is challenging enough to keep me interested but not impossible. And as others have said, the graphics are great! Best free game I have gotten in a while ... highly recommended. Have fun!
B004EPZ0AM|3.0|My kids are really into the Happy Feet movies. When I ordered part two we were three days from a long drive so I didn't expect to receive it in time but it arrived two days after ordering (with no upgraded shipping). It was a great surprise for the kids before our vacation!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Not what I was expecting at all. Thought this was going to be just a modernized version of the classic Wizard of OZ. It seemed to be more of a &#34;prequel&#34; to that movie, as Dorothy was not even in this movie! The acting really wasn't that great. I ended up not even finishing it. The only reason I watched the majority of the movie was because of the actors hoping it would improve.
0451232577|5.0|This book is great historical fiction.  There's lots to be learned.  Follett lives up to his reputation.  I cannot wait to read the next one.
B000002KDG|5.0|Some original tracks on this album.  Just a must hear album to see magic.  I pray my words are great enough to comment on this piece of beauty.  Simply the best!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, Love, Love this series!! I would reccomend this to everyone.<br />The Acting, the photography of landscape, the caractors roles, the acting. The interaction between the family and the help, just surperb!!! I can't wait for season 4!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's definitely a fun game but it locks up all the time has trouble updating and sometimes will completely erase your memory
B00D3V85FA|5.0|If you like the old Sabbath then you will love this album!! The sound is modern but the riffs are classic doom as only Tony Iommi can do it, this is as heavy as it gets without being thrash. I had high expectations for this after Geezer said the stuff Tony came up with was pure genius and not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded as I didn't expect the deluxe album to have songs that were as good as what was on the regular edition, the deluxe addition is a must if you're a Sabbath fan!!!
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|I quite enjoyed reading this book for the second time. There is always something happening and as usual Catnis is in the thick of it.
B0064W652A|3.0|I have not read a lot of comic book collections like most of the large reviews written here. Most recently I read the famous Return of the Dark Night. The story was much better in that one. With no previous knowledge of this book I managed to guess who HUSH was, and the romance between Batman and Catwoman didn't do a lot for me.<br /><br />That being said, it was worth the price on Kindle to Finnish in a few sit downs. It's got plenty of well known batman villains, although they aren't necessarily around for long.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was thought-provoking but not discouraging.  Lots of fun challenges.  I would recommend this app to my friends.  It was interesting to see the different rooms at each level.  I hope more rooms will be available soon.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Really great game and great gameplay, only downside is the controls are a little hard to use but you will get used to it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this was full of fun and very addictive. my kid loves it and so do I. I suggest it anyone of any age who loves despicable me.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Works good, but sometimes its hard to grab the right piece as they are so small.<br /><br />Has some nice pictures for puzzles
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a real simple game but strangely additicting. overall very good though. plus its free so that makes it well worth it
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik&hellip;&hellip; its a pretty good app you get to text your friends for free.......Now tell me that its a pretty good a babe!!!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I am stuck on level 147 for a very lllllllloooooonnnnnnggggggg  time and I thought this app would help. WRONG only shows for some levels
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Well I kinda liked Gangstar Miami... BUT then gangstar Rio came in I got it and I thought it was Great! But I thought it was the last of the gangtar series But then they announced that Gangstar vegas was coming! I recommend you get this game and it is NOT a waste of money so get it
B007REV4YI|5.0|There really isn't a James Bond film, including the well-loved Casino Royale, that I can say I love.  Except for this one.  I can enjoy the diversion of Bond I guess, but mostly it's Gadget, Gadget, Boobs, Snark, Gadget, Chase Scene, Gadget, Boobs, Credits.  And while the opening chase scene in this one is more engaging than most, until the opening credits sequence with the Adele song, I didn't think I'd love Skyfall, either.  But the movie from the moment the first piano chords of that opening song strike up until the end is genuinely heavy.<br /><br />I'm not a huge Sam Mendes fan, but I think he's plenty good, and this is the film where, for my tastes, all of his skills rose to a masterpiece-level peak.  The pacing is perfect, rhythmic without being sappy, energetic without being spastic.  The cinematography by the great Roger Deacons is heart-meltingly good, maybe his best work since The Man Who Wasn't There.<br /><br />I've read some reviewers calling it nearly Emo with all its moodiness.  I didn't think it went THAT moody.  And I also didn't think it went over-dark and cynical in its moodiness.  What it is, in some parts, is genuinely sad, and in a cathartic way, which is how sadness in fiction is supposed to go, in my opinion.<br /><br />The blu-ray is great-looking, showcasing a dozen or more shots that would each be the visual highlight of most films.  The sets change often, evoking several vivid emotional tones throughout, lingering on each one just enough to create a longing, then changing to another, which is an underrated filmmaking skill.<br /><br />There's lots more to say, but that's enough for my two cents.  This is the only Bond blu-ray in my CD wallet, and I'm glad to be able to join the club finally.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Its great to be able to have videos on hand to either watch offline or show to others things you've discovered.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Liked the old app alot better. This one is awkward to use. Dislike the asinine &quot;achievements&quot;, the large adds at the bottom, Severe weather alerts don't really get your attention like before. Just a mess. Expected better from TWC.
B004NSULHM|4.0|Bought for my husband. arrived in a timely manner and excellent condition. Of course he loves this band so is quite pleased w/ the content.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|but when i go to play it sometimes it wont load and I have to remove it and re install it grrrrrrrrrr  but all in alll great game
B003FXCSNQ|5.0|I nearly passed on this over negative reviews. So heres my opinion after reading it. Loved it. Simple as that. Its not Tolstoy, but i found it read like a good B detective novel. Entertaining. And good enough to 'base' Bladerunner on. Buy it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app because I can make a list then text it to someone or print it out.. I use it all the time.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I could not put it down-please,sent season 2 ASAP.I ordered it in in June or early July.I know it will not be available till September.Claire Danes was great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game. I love solitaire and it is much easier to play this way than with a deck of cards.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is addicting!!  Great series if you like this type of movie from England.  Great story line about a family dynasty.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It's a great way for a girl to explore other options in life and not settle what society put them or family expectations.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|after downloading multiple times, I finally began to play. the game always froze my kindle fire and was sluggish while playing. it was fun when it worked but overall,  I did not have a good experience
B001NHNG64|5.0|these books never fail to engage, always a great read, never disappointing or boring, and I always look forward to the next Reacher adventure.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This really was a waste of time and money. Poor everything.  Even my kids walked away after 20 mins to go do something else.  Need I say more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting little game...as the little guy starts running faster I find myself getting a little more and more anxious each time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I really love this game. i play it whenever i get the chance and i spend multiple hours a day playing it. i would recommend this game to almost anyone.
B006QPX6IG|4.0|This movie ia awesome! The only reason I gave it four stars is that it leaves out some important battles that occurred the second and third days of battle. That being said, so much was happening all over Gettysburg that it would be hard to fit it all into a movie. But, the movie overall is very accurate. The movie was even filmed in Gettysburg.  The cast is outstanding! Filled with big name actors! I've seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We enjoy watching Downton Abbey. It is nice to see how people might have lived at the time. Also the family dynamics are interesting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is what it is. I love having on my phone. I can check out what I will be driving into or what to expect what will be happening the next day... without have to pull up my computer.
B008CRC506|4.0|I don't watch this type of show but it came quickly and since it was a gift that was good, My Mom was thrilled to receive it.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown delivers another Robert Langdon novel that kept me reading and guessing.<br />His imagery and level of suspense make this novel a candidate for another movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Did not like the way it ended.<br />I enjoyed her(Judi Picoult) other books more:  My Sister's Keeper and Vanishing Acts
B008XG1X18|3.0|Havent really found anything I want to buy yet, and that is a problem, because I like to buy.Not to sure I like this program yet. Have to keep looking.
B00005JA8B|5.0|One of my favorite movies.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Its a great game. Its fun and addictive, but if you don't check daily you stop winning cash (the habitats have a limit of gold they can hold. Its like a zoo with dragons. Your zoo eventually grows and its really fun
B000H2GS6Q|5.0|Pale Rider is Clint being Clint! He is at his best on a horse with a six shooter in his hip. Pale rider is not his best western, however it still deserves a 5 star. If you are Clint Eastwood you don't have to do your best to get a 5 star in the movie industry.
B00181JGI2|1.0|Probably one of the dumbest movies ever made. I'm glad I purchased it on sale. A decent cast, but where is the plot? Not a funny movie whatsoever to me and I believe this is the first movie ever that I have not liked Jeff Bridges. This movie was all over the place...
B002BVOYBW|5.0|fun story- yet sad too- it is a good story about a look into mental illness and just who is really the crazy one
B002W1UEW4|2.0|Which is why I didnt like this movie. It is a goofball comedy of an action movie that is forced and dissapoints at every turn. On the next gi joe movie, &#34;Do better!&#34;
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I don't like the way the characters move and react.<br />I din'y understand the strategies needed to win.<br />I have removed from my device.
B0000028M7|5.0|It doesn't get much better than Alice in chains , it was as described and arrived on time. If you don't have this cd it is a must have.
B007W4OZ76|1.0|Very difficult to install with Antek Client. You need to bee a computer geek to get the multiple programs installed and correct addresses listed to make this product work.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so cool. You can collect and breed animals, you can also cross breed. Get a Griffin, a unicorn, or other mythological creatures. Two words ...<br />SO FUN!!!
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|it is a classic movie that everyone needs to see at least once in their lifetime- good characters and story
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Very well done. They captured all of my favorite 80s game characters. If you had an Atari  NES, or spent quarters in an arcade, then you will be drawn into this movie.
0823003590|4.0|I'd recommend this to all aspiring and accomplished artists; to those like myself who struggle with attempts at producing a likeness to their subjects.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i recently watched despicable me 2 on the theater and i loved it,<br />so i decided to watch number 1 as well and was not disappointed at all<br />both of the movies are fun and sweet.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|We really enjoyed it. If you are into suspense movies, then you shouldn't miss this one. I completely disagree with those couple of reviewers who said the movie is boring. Not at all!
B0095R4LM2|5.0|My 4-year old is now fascinated with Ancient Greek mythology and Herakles. This movie helped stimulate her interest and was a lot of fun.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|Wonderfully written and brilliantly acted, by an all time great cast, but the story line highlights mostly just the flaws in every character, leaving us with no hope. With no moralistic upside. When we are not in a recession, I may give this 4 stars, but the downer aspect mirrors our current job market to closly and costs it a star. Entertainment should be an escape from reality. This is a significant movie that you should see at some point in your life though.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This is exactly what you think it is going to be. Lots of action, cheesy lines, and aging action hero's....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The intrigue comes from the change and shift in how the characters act and react towards one another. What one likes or dislikes about a certain character often changes as they seemingly change.

B00BC24NT4|3.0|Realizing that Le Carre writes in his own distinct style, I read this book expecting to enjoy it more than I did.  I don't think I'll try any more of his novels.  They are perhaps appealing to  other readers, but I will not recommend it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Entertaining.  The follow-up to an outstanding novel.  The ending leaves the reader wanting more.  I am eagerly anticipating reading the last of the series.
B000056HOZ|4.0|I gave as a gift...as far as I can tell my sister-in-law really liked it. Really, how bad could Bruce be?
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great action flick with a well written story. Tom Cruise plays this character perfectly, I would definitely recommend this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say that no one else already has? Awesome book that takes you into a magnificent fantasy world.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I like this book very much.  It is incredible how this book has taken me through smiles, tears, happiness and sorrow...from page to page...
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I've been impressed with this lovely app by its interactive and fun features that my girls loved from the first minute they've been introduced to the same. I must admit that I've been purchasing a lot of the alphabet books over the course of the last year and whilst my older daughter is quite well attained, the younger one is still struggling with alphabet. Moving from the static books with such boring ABC references to this animated features learning tool was kind of discovery for me and for my girls as well. This app perfectly balances its educational character with the great fun for my little ones. The older daughter is acting now as the teacher trying to speed up the learning curve of my younger daughter. At the same time they have a great fun laughing at the crabs, especially when those are saying `good job' or similar upon successful completed puzzle task. I highly recommend this app to the parents looking for a simple, intuitive alphabet learning tool.

I've even bought a copy of the children's version and will read that next. I've never been a fan of Facebook, but am considering joining just to find out what James and Bob do next. Also to see whether there'll be another book! I think it's great they helped raise 5,000 pounds for the animal charity!

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|... how long it took for the game to reload when they died, and we do not have a slow system. Otherwise, they would have liked it just fine.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|Other then the music and to some extent the visuals this movie is just plain awful. It feels rushed with the same old tired, worn out - Evil corporations stealing everyone's happiness. Yes it's in play once again from progressive Hollywood. Lack of enough emotional punch - I didn't care about the characters all that much. I guess there is a reason I don't recall hearing about this when it was released back in march. 1 star for the music, 1 star for the visuals.

B009NX3TB2|5.0|In this humorous satire on the American dream, British director Sam Medes highlights of all of the absurd peculiarities of contemporary American culture, from cheerleaders, to guns, to consumerism and materialism.  Outstanding performances throughout, especially by Keven Spacey and Annette Bening, along with artful cinemetography and a sharp script, all combine to make this one of the best films of recent decades.  In this case, all of the awards were deserved.
0307716554|5.0|I read Ms. Lupton's other book, Sisters, so was pretty confident that this was going to be a well-constructed and well-written book.  I was not disappointed.  The plot is thoroughly unique and thought-provoking and the mystery surrounding the fire had me totally engaged, but where this writer really excels is in making her characters and their lives completely believable.  I can picture each and every one in my head, and just loved the nuanced way in which they were drawn.  I am baffled by the reviewers who disliked the occasionally \\"mundane\\" dialogue and who skimmed in places, because I think those very same places are what helped make these characters as whole as they were.<br /><br />I sincerely hope Ms. Lupton writes a ton more books and does so quickly, because I will read each and every one.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|the movie itself was very well done and based on how the Arabic cowards attacked and killed jews at the 1972 Olympics.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|The depth of character and characters portrayed is typical of the epics of Victor Hugo's era.  A few too many coincidences stretches credulity but an excellent read.  Similarities with Russian novels in that he reached the life of the people.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is Stephen King's best book since \\"The Stand.\\"  He is a great story teller, and this book is epic!  Really enjoying it, especially since I have been researching JFK's assassination since a high school physics teacher showed the class the Zapruder film and discussed the physics of it.  No way one shooter from the Dallas school book depository building in my humble opinion.  There is a lot more to this book than just the assassination though.  It has three or four stories within the story due to the element of time travel and a man of our time living in the late 50's and early 60's.  Fascinating! Great job Stephen King!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I like this case a lot. It is smooth and slick looking, the inside is a grip pad so you just have to open the case and place the device at any angle that is comfortable and it stays like that.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Before I purchased this product, I have done many research about it. First thing is if the charger match my car, cuz I ve read some comments said the charger cant plug in their cars. Second, the charger's USB output matches everything. I use SamSung galaxy S3 and SamSung tablet. I've never tried charge my tablet on my car but the cellphone one works, of course, I use the IPHONE usb output. Thats the thing that I worried about the most before I purchase. When I received the charger, the worries were completely gone cuz it suits perfectly in each usb wares. So far I really like it becuz it charges fast too.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|Saw the movie on HBO several times and had to own it.  GREAT music and just a fun movie to watch and watch again.  Not a deep storyline, but an enjoyable one, at least for me.  Truly 5-stars in my opinion.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have read two Ken Follett book's prior to this one, Winter of the World, and they were 14 years apart with Eye of the Needle in 1999 and the first book in this trilogy Fall of Giants, last month. The thing that both of those books have is amazing character development, that is so in depth that you have strong feelings for or against characters (that also may evolve through the story) but for very deep reasons because you are intimately brought into their life experience and mind. Additionally they are complex and flawed beings regardless if they are playing the so called \\"hero\\" type characters or \\"villains\\". Because in reality that is all of us, we might be a doctor and work 14 hours straight giving someone with heart disease a new chance at life, then go home and live a life ignoring your children. We are all grey as our political views, which for almost all of us, regardless of where they fall in the spectrum are never just cardboard cut out check points of an agenda and more often than not are selfish and hypocritical.<br /><br />It is that intro that brings us to Winter of the World which follows what I would call an epic in Fall of Giants (4.5 - 5 stars). Anyone who loved the first book must have been really looking forward to this one given you had 1,000 pages already of invested character development plus the backdrop of 1933-1949 period in history which arguably is the most tumultuous in our global history, especially given the players involved. Winter of the World is still a page turner (or in my case an Audible listen for hours on end on long walks or commutes), albeit not as much as the first book. The major characters Grigori, Ethel, Maude, Walter, Fitz, Lev, Billy and Gus range from bit supporting cast players to weak cardboard cutout characters of a generic prototype (i.e. champion of people so all is touched turns to gold or sympathizer with communists so every good fortune is at expense of others). In the case of Billy he is barely in the book at all and Grigori goes from maybe the most complex character in book 1 with so many levels to just a mouthpiece of the relevant Soviet event at the time.<br /><br />It is all these character's children (and their love interests) that become the main driving force and not one of them is deep or that likeable, mainly because there is no real delve into their life experience such as the story of Billy in the mines from start of Fall of Giants. Also the \\"good\\" guys/girls always seem to survive and the \\"bad\\" guys/girls always seem to fail. And by good this means some on the left side of politics, union supporting, always volunteering, always having house door open, always well mannered , always moderately dressed, always highly intelligent, always multi-lingual, always courageous and always good looking. Bad characters is the just the opposite of this except when it comes to the Communists who Follet seems to have a particular hate for as almost neanderthal barbarians. This came out a little in book 1 but was tempered a lot by the stories of Grigori and Lev that were so brilliant so as not to be the dominant narrative as it is Winter of the World.<br /><br />The funny thing as it relates to the politics of the book is that I agree with a majority of Follet's obvious political agendas but I probably found it as annoying as someone who would be very conservative politically and socially might find this, if not moreso. It is this type of partisan viewpoint which is why global politics is at a gridlock. Due to his indifference or loathing of various historical figures or his admiration of others many things were neglected to be mentioned - i.e. Churchill's rousing speech to the US Congress, FDR's internment of law abiding Japanese American citizens, Hitler's bringing many destitute Germans into economic prosperity and the German economy roaring with introduction of the Mark, the Soviet Union's massive sacrifice of military and civilians which dwarfed all other nations, the complex self interest in the post war world where all countries wanted to exert their influence not just the USSR, the flaws of Truman and corruption existing in the leadup to the A-bomb drop, etc.<br /><br />Without a balance across all the major historical events then you are all telling half the historical story and thus just as guilty as any dictatorial nation who brainwashes their populace.<br /><br />In regards to the social issues like National Health Schemes, Gay & Interracial Relationships, Race relations, Pre-marital Sex, Rape, Women's rights, Religion, Dealing with Death, Public emotion from Males, etc. and societies attitudes towards them, the good characters are always tolerant and almost like a 2013 version of tolerance and the rest are always bigots and boorish. This is one issue that whether conservative or liberal, intolerance was everywhere and certainly general attitudes to things like Homosexuality was almost universally intolerant across the board and just because someone was for racial equality doesn't mean they were for gender or sexual equality. This exists all the way today.<br /><br />However the book as a whole is still well worth the read as it continues the epic from Fall of Giants. Facts about things like leadup to Pearl Harbor, life in mid 30s Germany, the Manhattan Project and USSR search for A-bomb development, British flirtation with Facism, post war European reconstruction, etc. are covered in such a way that is interesting and including the characters throughout so you are both thoroughly entertained and learn a lot even if you are well versed in the period.<br /><br />Of the new characters, Lloyd Williams, Greg Peshkov and Velodya Peshkov are the most interesting albeit irritating at times. The most annoying are Carla von Ulrich, Daisy Peshkov and Verna Franc as they are all just pious and whiney characters who no matter what they do and what age can barely do wrong, always seem to live despite Gang Rapes, being bombed, being in concentration camps, experience bad miscarriages, starvation, spying behind enemy lines and are almost God like in their ability to always know best.<br /><br />Definitely read it if you read the first book, and if you haven't read the first, absolutely read the first book! You will get a great story from this book and a great schooling about many of the major events through that dramatic 20 year period of our history. Bear in mind the book is slanted towards the political viewpoint of Labour Party advocate from the UK and all that entails but that doesn't mean you can't appreciate the narrative as a solid 3-3.5 star very good story.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|This may be the best Jack Reacher book. I think he spent more time getting it right with this book. Or, maybe he had a better editor back then. While his latest books have become a formula this one is a real story. It also has a lot less violence than his newer books.
B005MMY9A8|1.0|I only managed to watch 20 minutes before I got tired of the nonsense.  Part of the problem was that the dialogue was so low that I could hardly hear, but the action scenes were so loud it woke up my wife who was sleeping in the other end of the house.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply brilliant! when I began the book, I expected it to be painful & just sad. I delayed reading it for weeks even after my niece insisted I read it. I won't lie, I didn't cry for the first half of the book, but the last half ripped me open, and I found myself sobbing for the pain these characters experience. I adored Hazel & Augustus, they are written intelligently and compassionately. And the story takes turns that are so unexpected & raw. The description of the book tells you that the main character Hazel is terminal so you don't expect happily ever after. But I did not expect the turns in the story that happened. This is the kind of book that makes you examine your life, your beliefs & will stay with you forever. This is the first John Green book I have read, I plan on reading more. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an honest & emotional story. Life isn't always fair & there isn't always a happily ever after...it is just real.

0756404738|1.0|So disappointed.  This is the first time I've written a review for anything.<br /><br />I actually listened to this on audiobook elsewhere (something which must have taken more than 40 hours to complete), and for the time I spent with this book I got basically absolutely nothing in return.  I really loved The Name of the Wind and had been looking forward to reading The Wise Man's Fear and learning more about the Chandrian and other mysteries but Wise Man's Fear offers basically no new information and fails to advance the plot at all.  The first part of the book with Kvothe still at the university is all right I guess (although it is pretty much just a repeat of the later parts of the first book in a lot of ways), and a little further in when Kvothe goes off to be a part of the Maer's court and it seems like the novel might actually be going somewhere things are enjoyable too, but in the end nothing comes of it and Kvothe is sent off to waste time in an excruciatingly boring hunt for some bandits so that the character Tenpi can be introduced so that he can go off to yet another pointless new location to learn to fight--though not before we spend over a 100 pages in the Fea so that Kvoth can spend what is estimated to be at least several months and perhaps even more than an entire year having sex with the Fae creature Felurian in what is easily the most infuriating section of the book.  And unfortunately it doesn't end there either.  After leaving the Fea realm Kvothe spends the rest of the book sexing up any woman that comes within 20 feet of him between paragraphs (I remember reading somewhere about someone saying that the book should have been called \\"The Name of the Wind 2: Kvothe Gets Laid, and I think I'd have to agree with that sentiment).  This is especially bad because the society of the Ademre is specifically designed by Pat to facilitate this behavior--they have some kind of natural birthcontrol in their diet that makes it so that sex leading to pregnancy is a far less likely outcome than it should be<br /><br />(in fact this supposedly even leads to a culture that doesn't recognize the existence of fathers--they think women just get pregnant just because.  Unbelievable that we as readers are actually expected by the other to swallow such nonsense.  Talk about breaking the suspension of disbelief.  Really the entire Ademre culture is like this.  Instead of using natural facial expressions like a smile, they keep their face impassive except in very familiar situations, and instead use many different hand gestures to get the same meaning--except that facial expressions are a natural thing identical across all cultures and its simply ludicrous to believe that there could be a culture that would go out of their way to train themselves from birth to be able to keep their faces passive (but only when in unfamiliar company!) and instead use inconvenient hand gestures that require you to use your hands AND your mouth in order to talk to someone)<br /><br />This is getting a bit longer than I'd intended so I'm gonna try and wrap things up here and mention just a few more things that really bothered me about this book.  First: Denna.  God I hate this character.  I want to say that every time she appears on screen the books simply grinds to a halt, but unfortunately it was never going anywhere in the first place so that's not quite right.  I guess it's like normally the book is just spinning its wheels aimlessly standing in place and then when Denna comes on stage even the wheel stop spinning.  Even if you for some incomprehensible reason actually like her, NOTHING happens with her relationship with Kvothe (just like the rest of the book).  They get in a stupid argument but then eventually meet again later and get right back to speaking to each other in annoying couplets like nothing ever happened.  That's it.  That's everything.<br /><br />I'll probably still read the third and final (though actually I really have my doubts atthis point that the series will end with just one more volume.  Pat has stated in interviews that there will indeed be only one more book, but frankly I'm tempted to think of him as simply delusional considering how little happens The Wise Man's Fear.  That, or the mysteries we've been longing for answers for are actually not interesting enough to warrant anything more than that and the third book will be disappointing as well) but if you haven't read the Wise Man's Fear yourself yet, just skip it, seriously.  I guarantee you will be able to pick up the third book and get along just fine without it.

B008KYOCA2|5.0|It took a little time to get familiar with how this product works, but once i got the hang of it it will now be my primary calendar.  it doesn't sync with other web calendar (i think), but i don't have one anyway.<br />i love the color-coding option especially, because it makes it easier to organize  and quickly identify a variety of activities.<br />it is easy to navigate, and you can see a little into the month ahead which is particularly helpful.<br />i never thought i would use something like this, but it's actually easier and more efficient than a paper calendar!<br />Con so far:  I just can't figure out how to use the tasks/memos.<br />So I just use the app \\"ColorNote Notepad Note.\\"  That also has a learning curve to it.  But it turns out that it's more efficient for me to have notes and calendar separate.
B00009R86L|5.0|The perfect accessory for the Domke F-6 bag or possibly any other one you'd want to use it on. Takes a lot of stress off the shoulder from conventional camera bag straps.
B002361MLA|1.0|I down loaded this book but was unable to read past the preview, I tried to get help from kindle but was unable. First part of the book I actually got to read was interesting, just wish I could read the remaining story.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|There were two items that bugged me about this movie. First it was dark most of the time, and then the sound would just go crasy when cannons would go off, or explosions. It  was a good movie Bruce.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have 3 Kindles, and I use this app all the time to keep track of the books I've purchased and read.  The ultimate goal of an app is to work as advertised and this one does that very well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is pure joy to watch. The character development greatly enhances the daily dealings of the British elite. One lives the subtle changes taking place after the war while laughing and crying with entire cast. Watching  how the serving staff and the family interact with each other demonstrates the depth of feelings they have for each other and the struggle it carries in a seemingly caste society.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I like the actors and characters.  Some are despicable, some are sympathetic, and some are just unbelievable (almost like the people I know).  I especially like Kalinda, the firms investigator, who is so detached and focused on her mission.  Good writing from the Scott's  who have tremendous success producing TV drama. it's also set in Chicago - one of my favorite cities.  I will watch as long as the writing is fresh and interesting.
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|I guess I should have looked closer at the cover to see the Advisory label- very sexual with bad language.  I cannot listen to it in the car, as I usually have my 3 year old with me.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|So, the app is repeatedly telling me to update, yet you can't because in order to do that you would have to go through Google Play which of course isn't happening on a Kindle.  Meanwhile on the app that ISN'T being updated, huge chunks of the news feed and notifications are not being shown.  So, until this version gets updated I am afraid you don't get very many stars from me.
B00APD6O16|5.0|I had this movie on VHS & it is worn out. So, I got it in Blu-Ray since that is the newest thing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game would suggest better instructions for beginners though I had to find a cheat on the Internet to get started.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|The movie was okay, but barely OK.  They shouldn't have made a sequel.  It seemed like a different movie and it was even in a different country.  The first movie was the best and they should have left it at that.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Funny, funny, funny, funny, and brilliant! This is a great plot with superb technical magic. This movie is a wonderful entertainment experience. Warning, if you're the &#34;church lady&#34; that can't go beyond &#34;fiddle-darn&#34;, keep away. But if you're everyone else, go for it!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I been a fan of Joe for quite a few years;have to say this falls into his top 2 or 3 CD's!<br />Listen to it at work and in the car.
0425238091|4.0|Now that I am far beyond being an intern, the book has lost some of its visceral appeal.  But it still a wonderful commentary on both young physicians and how patients are treated.  Re-reading the book has helped me recognize the improvements to both groups, particularly in the last decade.  Nevertheless, I still quote many of the laws of the House of God.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app. I just bought the full version because she like it so much!! She especially loves the balloons.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|No idea how to interact with this.  I read the posts of a few famous people but that is all.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Downloaded it to my Kindle to watch on the plane on the way back from Maui.
0062255657|5.0|Like going back to childhood, this is an enchanting reflection of how childhood used to be.  Just marvelous. Poetry and beautiful
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The CD arrived and plays perfectly.  The entire CD has wonderful relaxing Hawaiian music.  My husband and I both enjoy the music and so far haven't tired of it.  GREAT purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved the game, kept me busy and actually using my head, can't wait for more rooms to come. Yep
B000VZYPB4|5.0|With the performance of characters in this season, and all the possible situations that developed in it. It gave the writers stuff to write the other 5.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like Facebook.  Their new thing where they post &#34;suggested posts&#34; for me is annoying and I will pay to make it go away when the offer that.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|Forget Issac (children of the Corn) and Gage (Pet Sematary) They have nothing on the girls in this movie. Particularly the little one.
1594204217|3.0|I overall enjoyed the book. At times it can get a bit wordy and I had troubles getting through at certain sections. Overall enjoyed and learned new things
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Lots of fun !<br /><br />Great writing, acting. It was kind of like watching a different version of star trek.<br />As you follow the path of the crew of Serenity, personal lives of each crew and why the are there. People from different back rounds join together and become a family keeping away from the system and needing to survive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play it like every day! It's super addicting and loads of fun..... this is great game and I never leave any ratings but I just love it too much to ignore! This game is sort of like a mixture of temple run and subway surfer but with unions and really cool 3d graphics.... it's a must have for everyone who loves minions and even for those who don't!
B00A6WSTIW|1.0|i didnt lik e this at all. i prefer Jaws<br />no similar<br />woukd hve liked it scarier<br /><br />wouldnt recomend this
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is interesting.  I didn't play it very much but I would if I had time to kill with my kindle in hand
B004MYFV0O|4.0|It's been more than 30 days and I still can't draw well but I started from stick figures. I can tell a big difference though. This book has really helped.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book that is a to the point read.You don't know what you don't know about how to keep the love alive in your marriage.  Chapman gives first-hand accounts of how to learn what makes a marriage gain/ regain love and build a communicating relationship for couples who may be having trouble or who think they are okay.  I am going to share this book with everyone and will read Chapman's other books starting today.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely!<br />Recommend it to anyone who loves the relationship dogs have with us.  A make you feel good book!
1596680296|4.0|I really liked using this book for my first pair of socks. I am not sure I would have been able to do some of the more complicated steps, like the gusset, if I did not have my aunt helping me along the way (and a you-tube video or two). But since my aunt explained it to me in person, I was able to figure it out with the instructions and pictures from the book. Another really cool feature about this book is that it has instructions on how to make socks from all types and sizes of yarn. Overall, I would suggest this book. My aunt (the pro) would also suggest this to anyone. So if you're a beginner or a pro at making socks, you will find this book useful.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Prolific writing, magnificent performance, masters of their craft, but like most rock, recording detail is an afterthought.<br />They should have brought in Alan Parsons to the recording studio to lend a hand, or does this demonstrate another profitable venue for the Stones, as they could re-make these great classics via digital recording.
B005HSL626|4.0|Entertaining and free.  The game is passable and easy for kids.  Not sure about slicing fruit with a giant knife but I guess that's what people want.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This show was great. Fat Amy really made this movie. It wouldn't have been near as good without that character.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This app is cool because you can do all kinds of stuff but then again its confusing because you cant get anything unless u have a certain amount of something so yeah its confusing but fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ITS VERY SIMILAR TO SUBWAY SURFERS BUT ALWAYS IS GREAT A HAS GOOD THINGS A GOOD GRAPHICS, WORKS IN KINDLE FIRE HD
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Being a J. Cole fan since he was underground I've followed his career and progress as a rapper. With this album he returns to early rapping days when he didn't worry about the label, the radio, and the industry. This is the best album drop since Nasty Nas
B003UESJHE|5.0|It' s always a pleasure to see well-written and well- acted movies.  Colin Firth was wonderful!  Only down side is the use of foul language.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Pros:<br />• Language is lively, sophisticated, made me happy. Good metaphors. Nice cadence.<br />• Protagonist is quirky, interesting, believable.<br />• The idea of memory being unreliable is interesting. And it’s satisfying and intriguing when Rosie’s repressed traumatic memories surface.<br />• I ached for Fern and bought the protagonist’s sense of grief, so the novel works emotionally.<br />Cons:<br />• Got a little too preachy at times.<br />• Got too scientific at times (luckily, not often).<br />• I resented having to wade a quarter of the way through the book before learning what was going on.<br />• Not enough character interaction.<br />• What happened to Harlow? Dropped like a hot potato.<br />• I wanted there to be more drama—like an adventure where Rosie goes searching for Fern and aids in her escape. Reminded me why I liked State of Wonder by Ann Patchett—in that novel, the protagonist goes to the Amazon even though you don’t think it’s a good idea at the time. Yet it works incredibly well and there are adventures galore. The author uses her superb imagination to take us someplace fantastical. I wanted Fowler to do the same—to take me on a phenomenal adventure. Instead the book stays mostly inside Rosie’s head.<br />So the cons slightly outweigh the pros, so I give it 3 stars (liked it; didn’t love it).
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I'm glad they are going to release more to this story. I really liked it. What's not to like about short men with big hairy feet and funny personalities?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A peak into the lives of a period piece. I like as it moves through history, the inventions and politics are kept current. Very well done.  The pace of the show is good; the cast excellent.
1439177791|5.0|I finished this book in only two days. The power of the writing was astounding and the narrative was well organized. Portia is so honest I found myself crying at multiple points of the book. The epilogue is really what I loved the most, though. Portia suffered so much from her eating disorder and reading about how she came to heal and move on was inspiring and powerful. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever suffered with self-image or self-worth or has failed at dieting and blamed themselves. Brava!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great fun. I play it each and everyday. You should play this game. Hope you play soon.
1401238580|5.0|The magazine has great quality, ande the mask is way better than in what i expected from the product images.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just an all-around great movie.  Whether you are a comic book fan or not, this movie has a great story, great characters, and great action.
B002KCYIEA|3.0|I was actually impressed with Beyonce's acting. She isn't the greatest actress but I really didn't expect her to be as good as she is. The story line was just okay. A good move for when you're bored.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Snail pace.  It seems as though the writers sit down each week and wonder what they can just throw into the show this week.  I don't watch this anymore and feel as though I wasted too much time waiting for it to take off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's like the best game ever and I want the new update what's on the Apple androids please I love this game
B003FFEX8C|5.0|This is my first viewing of Catwoman new version. I really enjoyed this movie. The picture was clear and the plot pulled me into the story. I think this is a winning movie and many will enjoy and want to watch again and again.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|A must for my collection and at a good price. It has more on it than what you get from viewing it on HBO.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Suits has great characters that you love to love and love to hate. Meghan Markle is very easy on the eyes.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love this book and feel it is just as good as the Secret Garden.  Would recommend to book clubs everywhere. Good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I liked seeing how the British lived almost a century ago.  This covers the servants and the rich folk well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it!! 8ts a rreally fun game to play.... its keeps u interested for a long time... different outfits n people on Lvl 40
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!!!  Very fun and interactive game, Minion's are kool!!!  It's the beeeest gaaaaaame eeeeever (Homage to Sponge Bob)!!!!
B004LROUNG|4.0|THE Litigators is another example of why John Grisham is on top of his game. A fun read that covers the dirty wold of Tort Law. While not located in the typical south we have come to expect from Grisham , the Chicago backdrop adds a dimension of realism. A recommended read for all Grisham fans.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I saw the movie the girl with the dragon tattoo, then read books 2 & 3.<br />So good I'm going to go back and read book one!<br />Larsson is a wonderful author!
B003477DVK|4.0|This would be a very good movie for children or families.  It was a touching and very heart warming  movie.
030746363X|5.0|One of the most detailed & informative books about health, body transformation and wellness I've ever read. A cookbook for the body!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|In this game you will have so much fun be a doctor take care of your patients with the right tools!
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|A big, loud, bombastic score for a big, loud, bombastic movie. Queue it up and crank the volume to 11.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this in one sitting. I couldn't take my hands off of it. I love it because it's not the classic love story. It's realistic, it has everything you want in a book. There is comedy, love, faults, twist and turns. John Green sure knows how to twist your emotions.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I've read other Green books and, while I wouldn't call myself one of his followers, I think he writes with a realistic approach to teens and the world they live in.  This book is no exception.  Even though it deals with the devastation of adolescent cancer, it does so in a way that makes the reader root for the main characters rather than cry for them, until the end.  The only criticism that I have of the novel is the pathetic author that Hazel Grace and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet.  I just didn't understand the role he played in the teen's story or the novel: was he supposed to accent the destruction of the disease for families left behind or the power of a good book or something else entirely?  Other than that, a really good read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a wonderful book just as the others were. However, I didn't care for the way the book was concluded so abruptly.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I expected to love this movie.  It was okay.  I enjoy Johnny Depp and I guess I would have liked to see more development in the characters and situations.  More detail always creates a better story.
B000FC1192|5.0|Coraline is filled with amazing detail so therefore I rate this book 5 stars!<br />I recommend this book for kids 8+<br />I hope Neil Gaiman keeps writing amazing books for children!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked it alot.  It was creative and lots of fun. Looking forward to seeing some more rooms open up soon.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Well written with a balanced combination of humor and dark tones. Howl and Sophie make a dynamic duo. Definitely looking forward to reading the following books in the series.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I liked that the horse was the narrator.  When I began to read I thought  &#34;What? The horse is telling the story?&#34;  Beautifully told story of the waste of war and the healing power of love.  Great ending.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|Mindset is one of the most important books I have ever read. I wish I would have has the information in this book when I was raising my children. There are so many things a parent can do to create a growth mindset which is the biggest gift you can give a child!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I love the first movie in the series, and I'm not sure why I haven't been a huge fan of the others.  This was okay for light viewing.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Describing this movie really is best done by asking this question! While some people may say that the movie is predictable like the plots of many of the Star Trek movies can be, I really don't think it mattered. The intensity of the actors really pulled in the audience so that you could feel the actions taking place on screen really affected them on a deeply emotional level.<br /><br />This one definitely made to the short list of movies that I will own!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Right now I am having a problem and I hope I have not lost all my data. Other than that one issue the program does what it is intend to do and works great. But be careful when beaming or sharing your files from one phone to another.<br /><br />I hope DataViz will help get my file open from my older phone.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I watched A Goofy Movie years ago with kids I babysat. I have my own kids now and we were toodling around looking for a good movie to watch for bedtime and I thought of A Goofy Movie. We just rented it on the Kindle at first because I didnt know if they would like it, but they LOVED it!! We ended up buying it and they've watched it at LEAST 8 times in the last two weeks!! Its a good mix of funny and serious, music, comedy, peer challenges, and of course GOOFY!!! It covers a broad range of ages because of its content. Its like the newer Disney Channel shows, but without the dramatic, snottyness that is on TV today. My 3 yr old, 5 yr old and 14 yr old LOVE it!! And its nice to see your 14 year old enjoy something innocent sometimes because of the not so innocent things that go on in a 14 year olds day. It lets him slow down from friends and baseball and all the peer stuff and enjoy something simple. We LOVE it!!!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Tis isn't a spy novel. Rather, it tells the story of a (fairly low-octane) anti terror operation gone wrong, the attempts of a faction of government to conceal that, and how a whistleblower in the British diplomatic corps tries to uncover what happened. If that sounds a lot more boring than what the Le Carre books most people probably love are about (clever spies with complex personalities trying to outsmart each other against the backdrop of global conflicts), then you get a taste of why this isn't my favorite Le Carre book by a long shot. The story lacks any kind of major plot twist, its few turning points are predictable, and most characters in the book surprisingly (for Le Carre) simplistic. There is the eminence grise in the British foreign office who turns a blind eye when it matters but comes around just in time, the previously plain and opportunistic careerist who finally grows some balls but then screws it up just because of his newfound courage, the greedy American hip shooter. None of these characters has any kind of deeper level that is revealed as the story unfolds. And neither, for that matter, has the story. Which, on top of that, ends prematurely and without further reveal. Le Carre is always worth a read for his elegant language and the existential angst a lot of his characters convey. But beyond that, this book isn't terribly satisfying.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I had to take a break though as I started seeing zombies everywhere!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show! I am so happy Amazon has it and I'm happy it's free to watch with my PRIME account. Thanks Amazon!
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|I had to watch it being a Bruce Willis fan, and a fan of Die Hard movies in particular.  I read reviews before purchasing it that were middling, and I agree with that assessment, but would still recommend seeing it once.  Buying it?  Hmmm... Want my copy?
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I like so much these Indiana Jones movies. I got excellent quality blue-ray movies for very good price. One can watch again and again.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|'Nobody came to my seventh birthday party.' That is how the book begins, and it sets the tone: in short, stark and poetic sentences, it tells a story that is simultaneously fantastic and frightening. A story about a seven year old boy who discovers that the lake near the farmhouse at the end of the lane is really an ocean, that the people living in the house are really a few hundred years old, and who accidentally invites ancient evil into his own world. The text is full of poetic sadness that is casually tossed at the reader: the boy's parents lose their business, and his father has an affair, while the evil the boy let into his world consumes it. That makes for a powerful and emotional read in a way that no simple fantasy or ghost story could achieve otherwise.<br /><br />Don't look for a grand narrative or world design underlying the plot. Lots of fantastic elements are weaved into the plot, but their overarching connections are never really explored or explained. But that makes this feel like even more of a memorable, mysterious gem of a book.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I was bored and thought I'd watch this on recommendation of a friend.  I like the idea of it, but somethings missing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book! And...I'm not a reader! It's one of those books that you're sorry it ends. I highly recommend it
B00013M6NK|5.0|This battery is a true Nikon battery, not a knock-off.  It charges quickly and has good lasting power (I can take two to three hundred photos before it starts dropping off).  It doesn't last as long if I am using noise reduction burst, but that is to be expected.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Definitely not as in depth as the book, but it does accurately depict modern war and the successes and failures of modern campaigns.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album rocks super hard! I totally dig it! Grab it as soon as you can, you won't be disappointed.
B000W94FE6|4.0|Author's analysis and conclusions are backed by extensive expanded references and primary research data. About 18 percent of this medium length book consists of that information, and it is organized by chapter, making it much easier to find the references associated with the text. One could become an expert in this field with those references.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I was off Clancy for many years. I know these are different than the old Clancy but I thought it was still a good book. A little quick in some parts but overall decent. Waiting for the next one now.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Great history, great acting, great sets, great actors - what more could you ask for?! I'm watching it all over again!
B007SGM084|5.0|The prose in these books denotes a sixth grader as a possible assistant editor. But who cares? The sex was great and gave me many ideas for the future. All guys should read these books-it gives excellent insight into what women dream of when they talk about S&M.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Unexpected humor and shannigans!  Loved it! The guidelines said I had to add fourteen more words and I cannot think of fourteen more words.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I don't like fighting games.  Downloaded by Grandson, deleted by Grandma, who also added parental block.  I've learned from my error.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I haven't any problem with this foreign made replacement product? everything works as advertised and delivery was as good as any from the US?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|For a novice writer, EL James wrote a readable series with all 3 of her books. The books kept me interested and wanting more.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|After the clumsy characters and predictible plots of &#34;A Place Called Freedom&#34; Follett is back on track with historically accurate, compelling characters and plot.
B004X75RK4|5.0|hilarious movie that showed a great sense of humor for couples to enjoy and good song choices that stuck in my head days afterwards
0307341550|5.0|I don't want to say much, in fear of giving anything away, but I will say this:  after having read it weeks ago, I still have moments where I stop and remember something from the book and get chills.  Love the author (new to me) and love this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is better than a plate of spotted dick, bangers and mash and fish-n-chips combined. Watch it and remember why we wanted to be our own country. God save the queen!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Although I have not had the chance to use all the applications yet, I am satisfied that they will perform as required.
159463176X|4.0|It's a bit of a challenge with the names, but that's minor.  this is a wonderful author and good man, to boot.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|This was a hilarious little book, and everything rang so true. It was like someone wrote a book about my cat.
0307341577|5.0|I love this author because she tells a good story and involves me in it.  She has a real knack for getting me to leave my own world behind and settling in to her characters'.  That, and I love a good mystery and some goosebumpy vibes.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Unlike most other movies of this genre, I could actually identify with the the relationship between romantic leads Natalie Portman and Ashton Kushner.  The craziness and the intensity of their feelings and beliefs, regarding what a relationship (or non-relationship) should be, actually rang true to me.  People do crazy things when they are strongly attracted to one another--whether you are the person like Kushner who tries to frantically push the relationship forward, or the person like Portman who refuses to even consider the possibility that something special is happening.  Both parties, are, in point of fact, terrified that this thing will follow a different course than the one to which they are currently committed.<br /><br />For me, a very large and essential part of the appeal of this movie is that I could actually FEEL the intensity of the attraction between the characters played by Portman and Kushner!<br /><br />I was particularly taken by one scene in which Portman begins to realize how much she cares for Kushner.  As you would expect for someone who has strong emotions, her description of her feelings for Kushner are often incoherent.  I really loved it that she begin this outpouring of her feelings by exclaiming \\"He's so tall!\\"
B0095MVOMC|5.0|So many hidden object games are not that good but this is one of the better one - probably best suited for tablets; maybe a bit small on phone (I have a 10&#34; tablet). There are plenty of screens to play and the numbers are a mix between easy to rather difficult to find. A good way to pass this time. Though I got this one as the FAOTD, I may buy Agile's other 2 hidden object games!
B006ZPJWBM|4.0|I enjoyed all the duets, and the commentary.  Tony B. is just a treasure.  I like him better than when he was in his hay day.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I like this game I just wish you didn't have to log into Facebook to find neighbors. That's why I rated it 4 instead of 5.<br /> Anyone looking for neighbors invite me CJSXQJJ.<br />Give it a try no need to buy anything to play if you don't want.
1781162646|5.0|I didn't purchase this for a long while, because of it being advertised under &#34;Hard Case Crime&#34; with a picture on the cover reminiscent of an old True Detective magazine.  I'm not fond of that genre, but I am of Stephen King, and because of some of the reviews on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a try.  What I found was a simple, charming, compelling mystery told by a seasoned storyteller.  Loved it.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|It is not clear how to move the cubes where you want them.<br />Controls are very confusing.<br />I uninstalled it!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|This BBC import is one of the most unusual and successful series I have ever seen. I will disclose only that the first character we see is a clone (which is revealed early) and the incredibly gifted Tatiana Maslany not only plays all the roles with marked and convincing individuality but successfully plays some of the characters when they are pretending to be one of the other characters -- and both layers are visible. To cap it, the plot gets more and more involved, wheels within wheels, complexity upon complexity, unfolding mystery and conspiracy, with a creative genius almost never seen in TV drama. This show is in the realm of Battlestar Galactica and The Wire. This disc should not be started if you have anything else to do.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Love it, hold the kindle very well. The case is very pretty and protect my kindle fire better than expected.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I am very pleased with the status quo.<br />I wish that  Yahoo leaves well enough alone<br />I don't want to learn something new.
B008220BLG|5.0|My thirteen year old granddaughter would like you to know that this is a very nice movie, fun and funny, and is a good movie to watch at slumber parties.  I haven't actually seen it, but she's pretty honest.
0307744434|3.0|VERY MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED!<br />this book held me in it's grip for the first half...the slow unfolding of the mystery involving the two old wizards and their years-long battle always involving two proteges was fascinating. the suspense when marco and celia first meet and even when they begin to fall in love is also wonderful...two scenes that i thought were quite impactful and unforgettable were when celia auditions for marco and when they are floating on the sea of ink in the ship made of pages.<br />the reason i gave this book 3 instead of 4 or 5 stars though is because of the following:<br />* the author's descriptions of the circus become repetitive after a while.<br />* she begins by framing the battle as life and death...but it becomes painfully clear that there is in fact, not going to be any consequence whatsoever to this \\"battle\\".<br />* the characters are too thinly drawn...this is where i felt the most waste of potential...we never really get to know celia or marco intimately and so their passionate love story rings a bit empty.<br /><br />i personally prefer a more character based story as opposed to a plot driven one but the plot of course is important here...i just felt that the author sacrificed her character development in favour of focusing on what happens, and then to top it off, what \\"happens\\" eventually is a cop-out...i give this book 5 stars for the first half but 3 for the latter.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|It was ok to watch,and I would probably watch it again. Would recommend to a friend to watch it. Ok
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This is a great movie that I will watch over and over again. I don't think you'll be sorry for getting it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I'm hooked on this game! It's got lots of levels I can't wait to see and it's definitely challenging after the first few levels. I just think it's fun.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Std did tux Dutch fix cm so ssh at Wii Wii do cm cm up to ssh ssh! Lymph job up hop cm hmm n.a.
0316228532|2.0|I kept waiting for the story to get better--for at least ONE of the  characters to become likable, or at least get some better insight into how they got to be the way they were.<br />I had expected a much better read and was very disappointed.  I donated the book to the local library--maybe someone will enjoy it more than I did.
0770437400|5.0|I enjoyed the book and it was a great read. Everyone is so zombie obsessed these days and this book is a great read if that's your interest. One side note that I found interesting is that the author is the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to quite a few people.  Dr. Eben tell his story in a way i really enjoyed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades Of Grey, I have to say is one of my favorite book at this moment, but it was at a good level of confusing for me, but other than that the cliff hangers, mwah, beautiful. You ar one extremely talented author. Im now headed to Fifty Shades Darker. Cant wait to see what this book has for me. Although, thank you for writting these books
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|that can be a good and bad thing, but it's fun. you get to play with minion and compete and there's room to make it what you want it. hoorah
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|If you love submarine movies you will love this one.  Based on the NY Times best seller Red Star Rogue, the entire film was shot inside of a Russian sub owned by the San Diego Maritime Museum.  Ed Harris, David Ducovny, William Fictner, and Lance Hendrickson are fantastic actors....This is a must buy for any DVD collection
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|FIRST IT WAS TEMPKE RUN THEN SUBWAY SURFERS N BELIEVE ME BOTH OF THEM WERE COOL BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST IF THEM ALL!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Definitely 5 STARS!!! This game might take a little longer to load but once I played the game I instantly said that this is the most awesome game I have ever played!!! It has really cool graphics and its really fun for all ages because my whole family loved it!!! I would recommend this game!!! TOTS AWESOME!!! :-)
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I saw The Phantom of the Opera on broadway in NY and fell in love with it instantly. I dreamed of seeing it again but tickets are quite expensive. I was thrilled when this movie came out and was impressed at how accurate and moving it was. The movie includes a lot of dramatic scenes that take me back to the stage performance. My kids recently watched this with me and loved it so I had to buy it. Now we can watch it over and over and sing along with our favorite songs. I was blown away when I found out Gerard Butler was the phantom. He did and amazing job and I love his voice.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Played the free version, had to buy the full version! No problems, great, enjoyable game!!!! Pass it on.....it's worth it!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fantastic first book in the series! And it ends with sort of a cliff-hanger, so you're left wanting more. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I am proud of myself:) I sat and watched the entire movie! and what a movie! It was not my usual history-type movie, but I couldn't stop watching! Amazing transitions from era to era. It did have some of my favorite quotes; \\"if you fall, I will catch you\\" and \\"when one door closes, another one opens\\". I did close my eyes a few times:/ .....and my most profound thought whilst watching: \\"there is no life without music\\"
B00511ONPG|5.0|Great book, written well, I am not done yet but have learned so much from what I have read so far!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down. It's a nice quick read.  The characters are great and the story is well written and David Baldacci always does!  Another winner!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It's the Avengers, what more can you say, it is a very good movie of how the Avengers are brought together.<br />If you have read the comic books, this movie comes pretty close to what the comical were like.
B0089XH38M|4.0|Used several other different antivirus apps on my Kindle Fire but all seem to have some issues.  AVG seems Ok so far.  Abiliity to update on demand.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|nice costumes, plods along with a typical english story and cast , and story line like an old shoe, comfortable should not have killed matthew
B00DU74U74|5.0|It is a good movie standing on it's own, I did not read the book so I can not compare to how the story is in the book.  I am a big fan of Ms. S. Myers Twlight Saga and found myself comparing it to those movies and was not quicksanded into wanting more.  I will buy this movie but it is not high on the list of must haves.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|This movie was incredible and for so cheap. They even have English voice actors. There are special features and behind the scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was surprised by the greatness of this game.I got the game thinking that it would be stupid so when I played the game,I was like \\"what?! WOAH.\\"<br />This game was purchased at amazon
1781162646|2.0|Nothing of real substance. Very slow moving, no real suspense, and we never really get to know much about the characters. Makes me wonder if King might be starting to mellow out some in his years
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Princess Salon is a very fun game where you dress up a princess to look their best! Probably my second favorite Libii game. There are amazing dresses, purses and shoes to pick for your princess! Definitely get this app!!
B00DQQZNZW|3.0|I was anxious to listen to the full album, but to be honest I've been disappointed by this effort. It's more like DJ'ing to me than music. I expect more from them because their lyrics have been something to look forward to from the very beginning. 'Elysium' was also a bit of a let-down. 'Yes' was the last album I really enjoyed, and I think it's genius. I enjoyed the song 'Thursday,' but even that becomes a bit repetitive. It's nice to see them try something new, but I wish the lyrics had been able to stand up to the overloaded techno beats.
B000TVNR0U|1.0|We were ready to enjoy a romantic evening but when we inserted the dvd in our recorder, a message came up:  &#34;Playback prohibited by area limitations.&#34;  How can I return this dvd and how can I get one that will work?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I give my horse a five star rating because it's a fun game with vertial horses and you get to feed and groom them plus you can compete tournaments there's a lot more but I want you to find out the rest
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Lot of fun even w/o buying upgrades. I've had it 2 days and am very happy with it.Take a chance heck it's free
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|same as above loved the series can not wait for season four. excellent video and sound better hd quality than cable tv
B00D23K0MU|3.0|Let me start by saying Maysa's vocals get five stars. They are stellar, as always.<br /><br />However, I just can't get past the production direction on this one. Too much electronica, programming, and hip-hop influence on the instrumentation and the drum programming (or the live, mechanical sounding drummer). Some of her past albums are so much more organic, interesting, and lively as far as the instrumentation and production.<br /><br />And it's not that the songs themselves are bad; it's just the wrong kind of production for someone of Maysa's calibre. The backing tracks sound like a mellower version of something you would hear on top 40 radio from one of the hundreds of talentless female vocalists floating around out there. Maysa is just so much better than that. Basically, the tracks (other than her lovely vocals) are just too \\"canned\\" sounding for my tastes (with a couple of exception songs that are quite good). If there were more creative, live musicians backing Maysa here, this album would certainly be one of her better efforts. But, sadly, some slick, canned, drum-machine-sound-loving electro-hop producer really stunted what Maysa is capable of. Compare this to her work with Incognito and some of her earlier albums... and there is no comparison. So... five stars for Maysa. One star for the producer. Sorry. I hate to be so critical of someone I like so much. But it is what it is.
0345541588|1.0|I have bought about ten Reacher novels so far and am slowly completing my collection of the whole series. With this one, however, my experience was totally negative. Almost as soon as I started reading the book, the pages started falling out like autumn leaves. By the time I got to the end, I was picking them up from the floor and trying to sort them into the proper order. In the end I gave up and still don't have the patience to find out what happened. Just was was in the photo which would damage the Afghans?<br /> So, if the publisher reads this, a substitute copy would be very gratefully received! It might also give me more confidence in buying the remaining books in the series.
0060555661|5.0|Great book, simple in reading but before starting it you have to have basic knowledge about stock market otherwise you wont understand some things
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|What's the deal? A help guide but no game?! Give me a break! I'll download it and play on my ipad not my kindle I guess.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. I even got my sister addicted to it!!! It's wonderful being able to have whatever you need at your fingertips.  Recipes .. Art..Home design.. love it.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I watched all 3 episodes of season one and I found the experience to be a fun mix of action, wit and sarcasm.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|This was purchase as a gift but it was a movie that we had already seen, the movie was good and I would recommend it!
B0015XHX7O|4.0|So, I know that the vinyl copies of this have been getting a bad-rep. I was so pleased with the Kill 'Em All 45 RPM series, that I decided to grab RTL and MOP.<br /><br />I think the negative reviews are for the 33 RPM version of this reissue. It must be, because my 45 RPM set of RTL sounds pretty good! Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. That gatefold sleeve is very well-done and heavy-duty, too. If you want a great copy of this record on vinyl, look no further. Get the 2 LP 45 RPM copy, NOT the 1 LP 33 RPM copy!<br /><br />However, my original Elektra is a bit brighter, the dynamics are apparent and in-your-face, and James' vocals are right up front. In this 45 RPM mix, everything is a bit more subdued. However, I don't get any inner-groove distortion with these 45 RPM records. So, it is a trade-off for me at least.
B009MO5960|5.0|These movies, as nuts as they may be, are a true action-lover's feast!  Whether you're a video gamer or not, even non-gamers will love these movies and become fans as long as you like action!  Yeah, they're not great on plot and they are outrageous; but c'mon, they're just great fun and &#34;Resident Evil: Retribution&#34; is no different!  It looks great on Blu-ray Disc and the special effects are awesome!  If you like great action and fun at a reasonable price, then definitely buy this flick!
1781162646|5.0|It was not that scarey so don't read it if you are looking for a horror novel. To me it was much better than that. It was more a drama with a touch of ghost story. I loved it to the last page and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0036EH3UC|3.0|I watched this series for the battle scenes .<br />If one is looking for something non USA cultured like lingo or life style then one will be very disappointed.<br />Wondered why bother to use another &#34;F&#34; word to replace the original profanity?<br />Hope to see future production of such series about beings from another star system not model on good folks from USA for a change.
B009NY43NY|1.0|but wow.  It was truly her worst book yet.  :(  She clearly lost her interest in this series long ago
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Makes me wanna watch Jurassic park all over again. It's fun and I like how you earn dollars too. Some games it takes forever to earn dollars.
B0053O89XI|5.0|This show looks spectacular on Blu-ray Disc.  It even looks better than the original HD broadcast on CBS.  If you like your laughs, &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; is one of the funniest sitcoms out there.  If you've never watched this show on TV, watching it on Blu-ray Disc is a great way to discover it for the first time and catch up on it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Again this has become a favorite show of mine cannot say enough good about it!  Writers, actors and directors you are doing a great job!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I like the intrigue.  I would like to see more like this.  Can't wait for Season 4.  Good going team.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Persuaion is my favorite Jane Austin novel.  This is such a great adaption...very faithful to the novel.  I recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game me as a horse owner and horse lover can play this game for hours and not get tired or bored of it I love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Theater like before. Real actors, real acting. Magnificent twists and turns of plot with real-life situations that apply to the 21st century as well as to an era that is longer in time from today's lives than the mere years that separate us.<br /><br />Highly recommended and with Amazon's Prime subscription you get to see all the seasons and all the shows whenever you want. Such a deal!
B009CF7GRY|2.0|I love the original and so this one just really redoing what they did I found cheesy.  Many of the lines and actions where exactly the same as the original.  I think when you remake a movie you should try to make it fresh and new this really didn't do that.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I'm pleased with this holster. The only negative I can say about it is that the bottom end is open. I would've like to see them design this with a closed end as your flashlight does have the potential to work free if you're moving around a lot while working and could slip out. I haven't had the problem yet, but again, there is that potential. Overall, though I'm happy with the holster.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is perfect for the Kindle Fire.  The Fire snaps into place easily.  The cover folds to provide viewing of the screen at a good angle.  As soon as it is closed the Kindle goes to sleep.  Works well and the price is right.
0143039881|5.0|I picked up this book on a whim, and I was surprised to find that even before I finished it I knew it to be one of the best books I had ever read. While I can't speak to her interpretation of the characters associated with the trial of Adolf Eichmann (which in its time aroused some controversy), I can say that taken as a whole, it is a moving, subtle, and well-thought commentary on perhaps one of the most important episodes to come out of the defeat of Nazi Germany. She treats the legal, historical, moral, political, and philosophical aspects of the Eichmann trial with a deft hand and with florid, energetic writing. I wish there were more works of journalism like this.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I just can't say enough of how much I enjoy the characters in this show.  Sheldon is my favorite and his girlfriend is hilarious!  Great job writers and actors!
B000002V07|3.0|If you really like (heavy, bassy) rock music, get the album.  Otherwise, download the song(s) you like.  I would have liked to hear her voice more in the forefront.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The overall story feels more like a single persons voice.  Rather than the interviews it is supposed to be. As long as you can get past that the story itself laid out is quite enjoyable.  I was  a bit worried with the after the fact nature, meaning a lot of the suspense is gone.  Doesn't feel like a horror story to me, well aside from what the governments do to survive it.<br /><br />  If I have a real gripe it is that the author doesn't seem to accept that there are some things worse than death.  This leads to a business-esque justification on expending human lives.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|All the cross references, study notes and intro and topical articles you'd want or need. All the resources of the study bible in electric form.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it!! I was hooked in the first room. just make sure you have nothing else that needs to be done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could never figure out the hype till I picked up this book an could not put it down! I read all 3 books in one week!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It is simplistic, yet holds interest as you can move the cube to any angle to find matching pairs.
0345803485|1.0|I originally bought this book in book form last year for a long road trip with my husband and I couldn't get past chapter 2 without wanting to go to sleep.<br />So this year we bought the audio version for our long road trip and had to remind ourselves if we threw in out of the car it would be littering.<br />This is the most repetitive book I have ever listen to. We kept thinking it would get better ( it didn't). Besides the oh my's and blushes every-time they<br />did an email it was so detailed it drove us crazy. I guess the author never heard about texting. As to the geography being off and the whole she's a beautiful<br />women who's never been kissed and so on well it is fiction. As to the sex if you have never had any or no imagination it might seem exciting to maybe a 16 year old.<br />As to the cliff hanger at the end well I only finished this one because I was down about 35.00 dollars for the book and audio version so it was hear it through<br />to the bitter end. I could care less how this story ends in the following books. The ingredients on a cereal box are more interesting and yes the negative reviews<br />are by far the best part of book one in this trilogy. Overall I rate this book as a dud for anyone that reads books or cereal boxes with any regularity.<br /><br />P.S. my husband thinks I'm being too nice in this review.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|If you started delving into fracking for natural gas, this is one documentary you should see.  I would also recommend viewing Promise Land to see how the NG companies work when trying to get into a community.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Enjoyable romantic comedy. Great characters good plot. Kate Hudson plays a great egomaniac!  No one over acts unless necessary. Good chemistry between all characters.  It is believable and fun..
B008BU75IQ|4.0|True history of the early years of the World War I and lots of word pictures of life in England
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game the minions are so cute it is a game all ppl should have it J's so fun and Ps.look for the clear tube that u can run on it will send you to a secret room
B000W23KHQ|5.0|It was this album, Killer key cuts wit song titles  like European Son, Black Angels Death Song, I'm Waiting for the Man, Heroin and Run Run Run. The Velvet Underground was shunned both in sales and in the so called hip rock press, like Jann Wenner's Rolling Stoned. Never buy hype, this album was under the radar for years. Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison's guitar assaults blend beautifully wit John Cale's prowness on both bass guitar and electric voila (the viola shrieks unmercifully on the epic Venus In furs-great fkn song kiddies! so if some alleged \\"hipster\\" tells ya it wuz da Ramones or Clash, piss on em and play dis joint for em!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would so recommend it to others. very cute and my kids love it. thanks for the opportunity to be able to play it :)
B009RH9FR6|2.0|this case is supposed to turn your screen on and off when opened or closed. it does neither. that is why i purchased this one as opposed to a less expensive one. The rotation of the product is difficult, hope it loosens up more as I use it more.  disappointed that the description was not accurate.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book! And I still love it! This book is just so amazing! I can't wait tell August 23!
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|They should never of made this film, for those that like action, granted its chock full, however if you are a Die Hard fan or like a story line, i would not bother. Bruce is side lined and Jai Courtney is not likeable no matter how hard i tried!<br /><br />I waited months to watch this film and by the time i got to see it it just left me sadly disappointed!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Wanted another email app for my kindle fire and Yahoo is a very good alternate. Very easy to install and use.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was REALLY good. Even great. I loved it. I would highly recommend it. It reminded me of beautiful Bastard but smarter. Seriously  buy it
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Much better action than 4. Lots of unbelievable scenes but the reviewers are plain wrong especially if you like Bruce like I do.
1451695195|1.0|I read my friend's book then saw Eben Alexander and heard him speak of his experience at Midland, Mi. Center for the Arts.  After that I knew I had to own this book so I could re-read it again and absorb all that I had missed in reading it the first time.<br />Wonderful Book!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  Have supprised many people with it.  I understand the concept of how it works with eliminating or adding possibilitis with the questions.  But it still is amazing to see it work.
B007EMMINY|4.0|Great fun, worth the cost. Just be prepared as Rowand's humor isn't for everyone. The kitchen scene is great, be sure to catch it at after the end credits.
0345525558|5.0|All good. A compelling and moving story told so darn well. The protagonist is so sadly real and realistically flawed, along with most of the other characters, that anyone with an ounce of compassion or understanding will definitely relate. A \\"cast\\" of characters searching for a place of peace.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved it.  The title put me off but when I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I thought this app was great for reducing or increasing recipes.  Doing it in my head is getting harder as I get older.  Now I can cheat and let the calculator do the work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the few choices to watch that isn't rank.  Acting is awesome.  Love the clothing and set.  Looking forward to the next season.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Don't feel too rushed playing this game.  I enjoy the relaxing ocean life and tapping the algae and sand dollars.  This is an easy game to play for the little ones.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|I originally ordered a whole bunch of this stuff for my seven year old's birthday.  It was such a hit with every age-including the teenagers in the family, that I ordered more for my own personal collection.<br /><br />It is magical and mesmerizing.  It is better than the damp sand at the California beaches I grew up with making sand castles.  I have my own stash in a shoebox right now.  It calms me, and makes me feel like a kid again.<br /><br />The sand  is forever moving...  You can make a sand castle but the movement of the sand will eventually start crumbling but that is what makes it so fantastic.  :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a gift for your kid or yourself that is sure to impress-get this!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Great calcutator for work and home.  Was very pleased.  Easy to use and understand.  Would recomend this app. to all.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Just as with &#34;:Pillars of the Earth,&#34; he took me to the medieval world so powerfully that it was rather like being there. He is a master of detail as well as nuance.
B008XK69S6|5.0|Its very nice I had a large one for my samsung galaxy note and this is very similar, they're both great.  It's study and easy to use.  You'll enjoy it.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This short, tender, concise piece had me at the first line...kept me up at night and in the bed on this Sunday morning. I wanted to be part of her family...<br /><br />The relationships, though developed from a past perspective seemed believable for the most part.<br /><br />I recommend it. Made me take stock of all I have and all I have lost and, mostly, what I never had to begin with...
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun so far. My son and I are playing it together.  He is enjoying it as well.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|It was okay a bit draggy and not very believable.  Read it for book club<br />Did not choose it.  Just ok
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Another good movie in the series. Not the best but certainly worth watching. Another strong movie for Star Trek fans
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was the best book I have ever read I recommend it to ages 7- any age. I loved it
B000000WFZ|5.0|I  loved the movie and the CD was very moving to listen to. Make sure you watch the movie first so that the music has more meaning to you.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Selfish and cynical views of everything and everybody  ... I decided to stop watching it because it was so bad
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|This album was true Hip Hop. It's been a while since Hip Hop has had an artist comparable to J. Cole. Unfortunately, based on my personal demons, I didn't care for the track &#34;Let Nas Down&#34;. Nas to me is an idiot and may have had one or two good joints, but in my opinion if you're ignorant, don't pretend to know...and that's how I feel about Nas. J. Cole is the premiere Hip Hop artist of this decade.
B001NAT05W|1.0|It moved so slow I could not stay awake lone enough to find the plot. don't waste time on it!
B00003CXBH|4.0|This movie is based on the true history of the Jesuits in South America. It is unbelievable what they endured to spread Christianity to the native Guarini Indians.  I was not impressed with Robert DiNero's acting in this movie but Jeremy Irons was great! Beautiful scenery, too.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Night Visions is fresh and mesmeric. The price is right. There are numerous hits on the album; not just the chart toppers--which are fantastic by the way.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good. It's been a while since I read a book that made me mad at others for interrupting me and bringing me out of the story

The kids love cheering for Wilber and being worried about him all at the same time.  They also enjoy thinking of different words they would have put in the web.
B009WUBERW|4.0|It was packed with action, as expected.  It had a lot of cliche moments and flashbacks to famous movie roles for each of the various action stars.  Some might find that cheezy but I got a chuckle out of it here and there.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This show is well written with the main character being humorous while, at the same time, connecting with the viewer. If you like shows with a cheeky side, you'll probably like this one.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Very nice John Fogerty CD.  It was nice how he incorporated various artists with his past hits.  Would have liked to heard a little more of him though.
0060581808|5.0|This is just the first of the several 'Little House\\" books that I feel in love with as a child. I vividly remember not being able to read it by myself and my mom reading it out aloud. I hung on every word and did not want her to stop reading each night. I loved all the adventures and characters of each and everyone of the books. Little House in the Big Woods is where it all begins.  This is a must have for any lower and middle elementary school classroom library.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've known about this book for 10 years and now married 3 years finally bought a copy and read it together. This book is perfect for those 'love just isn't what it used to be' couples, but everyone including singles will benefit from the simple advice inside. It is simple, but full of stories to ease the repetitiveness. Every single person needs to read the chapter about the inevitability of falling out of love, and the rest of the book is how to choose the love that lasts a lifetime.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love this show. I was hooked from the first episode. Casting and plot line are fantastic. Thank goodness I can get all caught up on amazon prime!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great read, real tear jerker!  My first jojo moyes, will read more. Thanks for a good book, well written. Enjoyed it.
0142406112|5.0|This book as with this whole series will entertain and keep upper elementary kids reading books.  I had kids (particularly boys) that could not get enough of Alex Rider.  The book is full of suspense and action that keeps you from wanting to put the book down.  Even some of my reluctant readers got into this series since it became \\"the book to read\\" among my kids. Many of my kids would come into my classroom in the morning explaining to me how they would have done just what Alex Rider had done.  While others would come in explaining in great detail how they would have handled a situation differently.  As a teacher I can tell you that it is awesome to have kids that excited about what they are reading. Another must have for the upper elementary classroom library.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Watch to see which one wins.  I thought McConaughey was cast perfectly. The judge not as well cast, but a good actor just not true to the book.
159463176X|3.0|Not as good as his first 2 books. In fact, a little confusing at some points. This one was overrated.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Play it all the time! Only draw back is the many ads. But even THEY don't destroy my enjoyment. Fun game.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This novel is told in the voice of a 5 year old and the content of the story makes it terrifying right as it starts. This book was much more than I thought. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the content of the story. Don't let the simplicity of the words turn you off because of this 5 year old is very smart for what he has been through. Definitely give this novel a chance! Five stars all the way!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I liked seeing all my old stars doing a movie together and they made it all come together where you enjoyed the movie.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|They were right when they said \\"make sure you clear your schedule\\" once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Awesome!!!
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I read dystopia because I love the world-building, the imaginative story telling and (in the best cases) chilling commentary on today's world. The first book, Delirium, took a solid stab at this type of storytelling, enough that I snapped up the second novel.<br /><br />Which for me, was disappointing in that it focused too much on romance. If you're deciding whether you'll likely agree with me, I will note that I'm a bit jaded and generally find romance extremely dull unless it is exceptionally powerful, which this one was not.<br /><br />The main storyline, life in the wild, was necessary given that Lena was in the wild ...but it was rather dull and predictable. Again, I'm not a big fan of \\"living in the wild\\" type storylines. If you are, and you're not too fussy about them being original, you might like this better than I do.<br /><br />There were a few interesting new story lines, including emergence of the Delirium Free America, a right-wing-style activist group that wants to move the cure even earlier. There were some interesting aspects of this, and surprises even, which I won't reveal. But overall, this storyline and its revelations could have been handled much more skillfully.<br /><br />Some people didn't like the ending. My opinion is that it was okay but it did take the storyline in a direction I didn't think was that interesting for the third book in the trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, I would say if you liked the angle of Lena in love in the first novel, and you would like more of Lena in love, you'll like this book. If you were more interested in the dystopia side of the story, only buy this if you don't have other better books to read.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed the book it was a great love story. I enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks books. I recommend the book to anyone looking for a good love story.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is not an easy or light read, but well written, enlightening and well worth reading. I would recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The way the author mixes loss, doubt, stress, happiness and just every emotion imaginable is uncanny. great I loved this book. great It was great.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The dystopic society in this trilogy is not the best ever invented but it is reasonably interesting. The totalitarian goverment has labeled love a \\"disease\\" so at the age of 18 everyone must endure a mandatory \\"cure,\\" or  brain-cutting operation so that they will no longer love, or feel strong emotions, again.<br /><br />The novel hints at the truly evil nature of this. If you think about it, curing everyone of love has created a society of sheep. Like many decisions of totalitarian governments, it is really about control: the desire of some for power and to squash the individual to keep that power.<br /><br />This angle is explored a bit in this novel, which is why it gets four stars. There's some decent world building and imagination that goes into how the society is put together, how your life is mapped out by you for the authorities and how the government pretends the resistance doesn't exist--which is the main reason it is actually allowed to thrive. Sadly, the two subsequent novels don't expand much on the most interesting part, which is why I'll be rating them lower.<br /><br />Why not five stars? Well, the romance angles in this book, and the next two as well, are quite frankly dull and one-dimensional. And did I mention, dull? The only interesting thing about them is that the romance is forbidden, but it's not enough to carry pages and pages of flat unimaginative romance.<br /><br />For those of you looking at reading this trilogy, I would suggest reading this book. It's worth it. After reading it, if you enjoy reading Lena's romantic adventures, go on to the next two; if you don't, you can probably stop after this one since there's very little new on the dystopia angle.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|If you have read the books, then watching this movie with Tom Cruise is not easy. Throughout the movie, I keep thinking, is Cruise in high heels? Is he standing on a box? Got platforms on?<br /><br />Honestly, getting a munchkin to play a giant just doesn't work. I much prefer my mental pic of Reacher.<br /><br />For those that have not read the books, you will probably find it ok. It's a typical Tom Cruise production, where he is super at everything. Robert Duvall is the best part of the movie.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like this game but all the main elements should be coins also you should be able to get more coins faster.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game is hard! It walks you through step by step but its just not a \\"fun\\" game for kids, I got it in hopes of my son watching me play it and then when he gets old enough to play in his own but I don't think he will be able to play it, when me as a grown adult can't find it fun! Disappointed :( I really wanted to like it
B0089LOKHG|3.0|There were two storylines in this book: Hana's story and Lena's story.<br /><br />Hana's story was gripping and interesting, following her life post-cure--the story of a golden girl at the top of society, marrying into a powerful family, a media icon and yet somehow, there's something wrong. This was a fascinating and very well done story line and I was completely hooked.<br /><br /> Lena's story was desperately dull, bogged down in more boring romantic stuff. I know the book is about a society which forbids love, so there has to be some romance. But Lena's romances are very dull. And the other part of Lena's story, trying to stay alive in the wild while pursued by evil regulators, was poorly paced, badly executed, unimaginative and frankly just dull. I hated having to slog through Lena's story every other chapter so I could get to the interesting story about Hana!<br /><br />And then there's the ending. Lauren Oliver said in an interview (and in a video on her tumblr account) that the ending was deliberately left open-ended to allow readers to imagine for themselves what comes next and have the book \\"continue to live inside you.\\" This is nonsense. A good ending can, in fact, leave a lot to the imagination, but there is a skill in doing that--and Ms. Oliver, despite her obvious skin in storytelling in general, simply hasn't learned that skill.<br /><br />This ending feels simply like a cop-out. It feels like she kept writing without a plan and then, at the end, there was no way to craft a spectacular ending...there wasn't a way to do that since she hasn't planned and hadn't planted the seeds for it. It was a letdown, like, you took me on this long journey and you didn't know where you were going?<br /><br />There could have been a way to craft the ending--even leaving even less closure than she did--which could have been more satisfying. It's not simply by not answering questions that you create a book that lives on in the readers. It's by making revelations at the end that are powerful enough to keep you thinking about the book for years...when a book does that, the ending becomes less important and it can be more powerful to leave the details to the imagination. But if you don't have anything powerful to give us, stop trying to be \\"literary\\" with the ending and simply give us a good conventional satisfying ending with the is dotted and the ts crossed.end that are powerful enough to keep you thinking about the book for years...when a book does that, the ending becomes less important and it can be more powerful to leave the details to the imagination.

B000WMFZNS|5.0|Best ever movie.  Am the biggest Charlton Heston fan ever and would not have missed the opportunity of getting this collection.  It is absolutely wonderful.
B002ZG974W|5.0|I love this movie. It is so interesting to see the babies in different parts of the world. There's definitely a bent to point out how much better off the American baby is, which is true! Love this movie and that there really aren't words.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Amon amarth latest cd does not let you down. Great cd from Start to finish .  If you have listen to their previous album this is much of the same but still a gold album to listen

B000VR824S|5.0|Once again, buy these. If you love great guitarists you just can't miss. These DVD's come close to capturing what happens live. Do yourself a favor and enjoy.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I was looking for an app that was easy to use and not limited to 3 documents. Some apps don't allow you to save more than 3 documents unless you buy the app. That's not for me! I love the freebies and this one has no limit, it's easy to save and edit, and I can navigate it with ease. Download this app!
B004BFPDQQ|5.0|You have to write long reviews for these posts. Dumb. I have the same thing to say about all of theme. You just can't lost seeing the best guitarists playing together at these concerts. I watch these all the time. Buy them.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I think that this app is very puzzling but you can always solve it if you have a partner to help. I found this true. It's like the real world jammed into a computer. This 3d world will help you in them real world  because it is so realistic. I think this app is amazing but I often get stuck. I think it has a very mysterious vibe to it. Good luck!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Well I started reading these books because I'm a fan if the show. It's weird reading the books now because I keep comparing the book to the movie and although the plot is the same so many things are different. You would think that a director would at least stick to the descriptions of the girls from the book but there is a huge difference. Anyways I love the book and fantastic to start the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent series. The problem is amazon streaming SUCKS. Though I purchased HD, it comes out as standard because of slow streaming and it is amazon's fault, not my ATT Uverse provider.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Honestly, not as scary as everyone made it out to be. The gore was a little much, and the plot kind of anticlimactic.
B009ZFPQOQ|2.0|First it did not load correctly, had to delete it and reload it. Second, it will not store locations, Third you cannot use your current location as a stored location if you could store a location. As far as I'm concerned fairly useless, so far. I will try to reload it and try to use it again, but so far I don't like it. Did not put &#34;hate it&#34; yet, but I'm close.

0871164566|5.0|I have been making jewelry and teaching wire-wrap classes for almost 10 years now.  I have a good variety of books but this is the best by far.  Learning to work with wire is very tedious and requires patience and practice.  This book has an abundance of creative ideas, good close-up photos and step-by-step instructions.  My only caveat would be that this is not for beginners.  If you have had some experience with making earrings, for example, and know how to make a loop and wrap, you might be able to work through this, starting with the simpler projects.  If you are an experienced designer, get this book!  I have already sold several of the wire-frame pendants.  It is a great way to use up those odds and ends of beads and findings that any jeweler has lying around.  Just love it.
B004C0WVP6|5.0|I had three of these already and I wanted to make a raid 10 array with them so I needed to find another, it is a pretty old drive at this point but it gets the job done!

B005DJREGQ|4.0|The season is entertaining and doesn't trouble the brain too much, but in the end it is teenage information mis-management all over again, so some people may not like it much.
B000O599WG|5.0|Rio Bravo is an excellent movie with a great plot and cast starring John Wayne. Made in 1959, and directed by Howard Hawks The story is set in the western town of Rio Bravo with The Duke as sheriff guarding a bad man who has shot and killed a man in cold blood. Dean Martin plays an alcoholic deputy and Walter Brennan is another deputy. The story is a basic one of holding out against the odds when the bad man's brother who is rich and powerful tries to get him free by anyway possible. Angie Dickinson is The Dukes live interest and Ricky Nelson is the heroic and mysterious gunman and cowhand...Inwont go into the rest of the details but let me say it will keep you interested until the end. A great movie soundtrack and songs sung by Martin and Nelson enhance this classic western. A great movie overall that is highly recommended!
B004SBX112|5.0|I loved playing Angry Birds Seasons, Rio, and Original, and have attained three stars on every level in all thee games.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a fascinating part of our history, and I was amazed that I had not heard of this happening in the US. My heart broke for these children and what they went through, and you can't help but compare it to slavery. Maybe it was better than the alternative, and maybe not. She did a great job of turning it into a fictional story and relating it to a current orphan's life.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Every summer I decide on a &#34;classic&#34; book to read or re-read.  Somehow, Catch-22 caught my eye this year and, I just can't believe that I missed reading this book.  Each page is a delight.  The writing is fabulous!  The characters are fabulous!  The social commentary is fabulous!  But most of you already knew that.  In the &#34;words&#34; of the new generation, it is truly a &#34;laugh out loud&#34; but it is also a &#34;think out loud&#34;.  I urge you to go back and take a look.

B00846REIS|1.0|Yuck.  Is Gideon Cross what passes for an alpha man these days?  A guy who furiously masturbates in his sleep and bawls in his girlfriend's neck until dawn?  Okay, we get it.  He's good-looking.  So what?  He was such a creepy, unappealing weirdo, I couldn't read the sex scenes without cringing.  With his stalking, spying, and wild nightmares, he sounded like a guy in desperate need of a restraining order.  The writing isn't much better than the characters (\\"Friday started out awesome\\"), and the conflicts are of the \\"ex-fiance reappears out of the blue\\" variety.  God help us if this is the blueprint for successful erotic romance.  It was absolutely dreadful from start to finish.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|So this is it. The moment all Superman fans have been waiting for since it was revealed that Dark Knight trilogy helmsman Christopher Nolan and director Zack Snyder ([[ASIN:B001P575IE Dawn of the Dead - Unrated Director's Cut]], [[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B002Q9VPFM Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut]]) were rebooting the franchise. Of course, \\"Man of Steel\\" is better than any current standalone Marvel Comics movie (i.e., Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, or any of the Iron Man trilogy). But the question most people may ask is: \\"Is it better than [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]]?\\" More on that in a moment.<br /><br />Anyone who knows me knows I'm a big Supermen fan and not much of a Marvel fan (save for Daredevil and The Punisher), but I can honestly say that \\"The Avengers\\" was an excellent film -- the most perfect (next to [[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]) comic book adaptation to date. When critiquing a comic book film, I not only look at story, acting, and directing, but also if the film sticks to or addresses the original material. Both Marvel and DC comic characters' origins have been retconned, reimagined and rewritten so many times over the years since they first were originally introduced to the world that filmmakers have had a lot of material with which to work. And while some creative license is allowed, the story must stay mostly true to the comic book story and the characters have to definitely stay true to their comic book counterparts.<br /><br />I remember seeing the original 1978 [[ASIN:B000IJ79UW Superman - The Movie (Four-Disc Special Edition)]], starring Christopher Reeve, and loving it. I still love it to this day. But that Superman was one for younger and/or more general audiences -- a tongue-in-cheek Lex Luthor, his goofy, bumbling sidekick Otis, the sexy, misunderstood \\"bad\\" girl Miss Teschmacher, and a Lois Lane who is nothing short of annoying. Reeve's performance was excellent, but, as most Superman fans can tell you, his Clark Kent was the C.K. of old. The new Clark Kent -- while still a little bit of a klutz and wearing glasses -- isn't quite so dorky (think Tom Welling's portrayal from The CW's [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]]). Also, no offense to Richard Donner's masterpiece, but the 1978 film simply does not achieve the greatness of the comic and who Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman has become over the years since. When I was a kid and a teenager, I always preferred Batman to Superman because Batman was a darker comic and darker character; his parents were murdered, people died. The teen angst in me related to him and his plight. Whereas Superman -- at the time -- seemed like a goody-two-shoes, a boy scout. And while he still may be that kind of superhero, as I've grown, my admiration for the Kryptonian has grown, seeing how he has more problems than one may contemplate. If you were to think more about Superman's plight, you'd see that he doesn't have it so easy either. There are many philosophical complexities and moral dilemmas presented in Superman's stories. \\"Man of Steel\\" features all of these complexities of Kal-El's existence:<br /><br />  1) The knowledge that despite his love for humans and his feeling of being one, knowing he will always be an outsider -- check!<br />  2) The knowledge that any time an alien comes to defeat him or make him suffer, it is his mere presence on Earth that brings them there so he believes any destruction or human casualty is his fault -- check!<br />  3) The knowledge that any small physical reaction could lead to instant disaster and would garner great scrutiny and fear from the humans he so loves -- check!<br />  4) Having to truly sacrifice those he loves the most ... even meaning letting loved ones die for the \\"greater good\\" -- check!<br />  5) Being solely opposed to killing ... no matter good or evil -- check!<br /><br />It has been reported that the \\"controversy\\" (if that's what you want to call it) of \\"Man of Steel\\" particularly touches on two aspects of the film. One involves that last bullet point I just mentioned. The other is the destruction of Metropolis at the end of the film when Superman (Henry Cavill) fights General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his Kryptonian cronies -- an inevitable result considering a bunch of super-powered alien beings are there to take over the planet and trying to kill Superman (this is definitely no Superman II where Superman flies away to avoid destruction and human casualties). The fact that the destruction of a city is even an issue proves that critics and audiences are merely nitpicking for any negative criticism they can find. Was there a lot of this nitpicking when \\"The Avengers,\\" \\"Watchmen,\\" \\"Transformers 3,\\" or \\"G.I. Joe\\" were released (and that doesn't include all of the numerous alien-related films where New York is destroyed)? Did their destruction of a city sully the film's worth? Besides, if you want to get into semantics, then you have to remember that Superman has unlimited strength and can move at the speed of light, so I'm sure the city could be rebuilt in no time. Besides, if it weren't for the heavy action you expect from a Superman film, then those same critics who are moaning about the destruction of a city would be saying how little action there was in the film (remember what most people said about Bryan Singer's 2006 [[ASIN:B000J10ERO Superman Returns (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]?).<br /><br />So ... onto the question I originally posed: Is \\"Man of Steel\\" better than \\"The Avengers?\\" Yes. And I'll tell you why. Basically the same type of threat that was in \\"The Avengers\\" (i.e. a demigod being attempting to have alien beings take over Earth, starting with a major city) is the same threat in Man of Steel. The one major difference? The threat that took an entire superhero team (and a few random regular humans) to diffuse in \\"The Avengers\\" took only one man (and a few random regular humans) in \\"Man of Steel!\\" But it's just not that. Man of Steel takes the audience into every aspect of Superman's character (his birth and more background into his birth parents and home planet, his formative years, and his reclaiming his heritage and powers), and also injects some of the new origin material that has inhabited the comics for the past few years. The scope is massive and Snyder pulls it off without making the audience roll their eyes. To say this is not your grandfather's or father's Superman is a huge understatement! \\"Man of Steel\\" introduces the audience to the contemporary Superman. Nolan and screenwriting partner David S. Goyer inject more of the alien world and technology of Krypton into the story, which is necessary seeing how the main hero and villain(s) are alien (Kryptonian) and this is an origin story. The film explores both Clark's farm-bred past and his isolated present, which is what makes the story so great. Unlike \\"Avengers,\\" which would not have worked if not for each character (save Hawkeye and Black Widow) having their own respective movie before its release, \\"Man of Steel\\" shows both Kal-El and Zod's background, almost making Zod a character with which to sympathize. In fact, there is a bit of art imitating life when it comes to Zod's views as well as the reason behind Krypton's fate. But I cannot go into those points without giving away the story.<br /><br />I believe an updated cinematic origin and retelling of Superman is long overdue, and Nolan, Snyder and company have greatly succeeded! The acting is well-done, the writing is stellar (with plenty of quotable lines), there is plenty of action (at least enough of what a fan would expect from a Superman movie), and every major complexity of Kal-El's life is conveyed in all of its bittersweet glory. Plus, there are hidden hints at the existence of both Lex Luthor (see the tractor trailer logos?) and Bruce Wayne (see the satellite Zod throws at Superman?). What more could a true fan ask for?<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />Some may not like the fact that Lois Lane (Amy Adams) finds out Superman's true identity but I thought it was a breath of fresh air. Honestly, how could a respective, professional reporter like Lois not tell who Clark was just because of him wearing glasses?<br /><br />****END OF SPOILER****<br /><br />Some critics did not like the way particular characters were treated but I found all situations understandable and adding more depth to the story. It should be pointed out that if Nolan & company did a somewhat \\"traditional\\" origin story -- the same one all audiences have seen over and over again -- critics and audiences alike would be quick to point it out and complain about how unoriginal and ho-hum the film would be. If there are two things that \\"Man of Steel\\" is not, it's unoriginal and ho-hum! These people are just overly critical blowhards who can't be pleased. And for anyone who thought any part of the film's story was confusing, I'd wonder where they were coming from as I found the film's story not that difficult to follow. When you go to see \\"Man of Steel,\\" prepare for lots of action, a good glimpse at Krypton, a touching story and the epic beginning of a spectacular universe of characters! If \\"Man of Steel\\" is the beginning franchise in what DC Comics Films will be offering, we're in for one hell of a fun, imaginative, heartfelt, cool ride! \\"Man of Steel\\" is the best big movie of the summer and the best action film I've seen so far this year!ular humans) in \\"Man of Steel!\\" But it's just not that.

0062280228|5.0|Neil Gaiman has written a marvellous book here, poised beautifully between literary fiction, fantasy and horror, and adult (or child) fairy story<br /><br />The central character, a man in middle age, with the disappointments of adult life upon him, turns down memory lane, when the death of a parent and the funeral gathering will unite him with the years passed. A failed marriage, work, creativity and the dreams of youth not having quite turned out in the way the younger man or boy might have wished he physically revisits where he once lived, as a seven year old boy, and recounts and remembers what the adult man has forgotten.<br /><br />What makes this different from other 'revisit childhood' books is that the revisited land is large with powerful myths, and presided over by 3 potent female figures who live by 'the ocean at the end of the lane' The 3 powerful women a grandmother, a mother and an 11 year old (crone, mother, maiden)are constantly reminding this reader of other pagan and indeed religious threes - a matriachy of power and goodness to rival patriarchal religion, - including a willing sacrifice - the three Fates of Greek mythology, even as they appear to be initially easily dismissed perhaps as the three witches.<br /><br />Gaiman narrates a brilliant story - more than a battle between good and ill (is it really good to have all desires met - even the desire to be happy?) but under the tight and page turning narrative drive, the fine writing, the believable characters and relationships, philosophical and psychological insights are placed for the reader to chew on.<br /><br />Its certainly a book which might be enjoyed by a child, even read to a child, especially as the central character is a child, but it reaches, I think, to the wisdom within a child, and to the child within an adult:<br /><br />As Gaiman has his central character say:<br /><br />I liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. They just were.<br /><br />I also liked the absolute truth (so it seems to me) of this:<br /><br />Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.<br /><br />And, if you don't like that sort of psychology, what about the plunges into transcendental experience - perhaps the experience much fine poetry and music takes us towards:<br /><br />In those dreams I spoke that language too, the first language, and i had dominion over the nature of all that was real. In my dream, it was the tongue of what is, and anything spoken in it becomes real,, because nothing said in that language can be a lie. it is the most basic building block of everything.<br /><br />As adults, we have (in the main) forgotten the power of words, of the naming of things, of how potent the dominion of naming and language must have been to our species. And why (some of us) venerate poets, who give us back that placehey just were.<br /><br />I also liked the absolute truth (so it seems to me) of this:<br /><br />Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside.

B00C2PO09I|4.0|a love story,with cool visuals. the boy gets girl,boy loses girl,boy gets girl back is in full effect here, so dont go into it expecting anything different than the usual lame tired same old same old. the visuals,however,elevate it to a chick flick worth watching.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I love this book.  I just finished the whole 30 day challenge and this book provides everything you need to do it.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun for a while. Needs more upgrades and the gameplay gets stiff at the higher levels but still a fun game and good time killer
0679805273|5.0|We bought this book to have all of our daughters teachers sign (from Kindergarten all the way to high school) Then to eventually give to her as a graduation present! It is hard back with a paper cover and has LOTS of room for teachers to sign if you want to use this idea for your child too!
B001NHNG64|2.0|good start . Got one wondering about why this particular person was targeted for capture. Once in their remote location, attempts at escape and foiling of enemy were implausible. Actions and in-actions of many characters were silly.
0762777931|5.0|I bought this book due to chronic pain - and I bought a juice from Amazon the same day. My pain is better and I have lost 13 pounds in two weeks. Highly recommend.
1401324649|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone.<br />I haven't had such fun with a book in years.<br />The 100 year old man is a character who everyone should meet<br />and with whom they should spend time.  Enjoy!!!!
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|The saga has been wonderful from the 1st book captivating,different family members have purchased them also,we all have been entertained by reading the series and had great discussions on what is coming next.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|I had never played the the game Angry Birds before so I downloaded the free app. I enjoyed it so much I told my son and he suggested this version. I purchased it and have had a great time playing it. The graphics are great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is gripping read, full with colorful and juicy language. Many insightful moments that invite you to travel deeper into the lives of the characters.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|This film is an affectionate send up of schlocky sci-fi shows, and those of us who love them - you'll laugh at all of the nods, cliches and sight gags, and you'll probably laugh at yourself a bit, too. Even the music pokes some fun at the heroic themes we all know and love.<br /><br />I am no fan of Tim Allen, but I have to admit he was a great Buzz Lightyear, and he was also the perfect pick for \\"Galaxy Quest\\" - he's funny and totally believable as Jason Nesmith.<br /><br />Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are excellent(Sigourney Weaver's duty on the NSEA Protector is hilarious) - wish Tony Shalhoub would have had more screentime, but the bits with him in it are all pretty funny.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition looks better than I was expecting, worth upgrading for under ten bucks.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A view into the past.  I believe it to be an accurate picture of the gentry of the period and of the lower class doing their bidding.  Seeing the changes to England is enlightening.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Well developed characters in a short piece. Sanderson's gift for weaving multiple storylines into intriguing work of fiction leaves you hoping he'll write more of it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|After I got this app I realized that I really didn't need it That's all. I am not on the internet with my tablet that much because it is an inexpensive one and it doesn't have a lot of room.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I truly enjoy reading anything this author writes. I loved all of the different stories in this book. I am sad to be finished.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Many shows loose my interest after season 2. So far this season this acting has been superb and the story lines have been intriguing.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this app is not so good. I wanted to play the demo and then download the game but now I dont get close to ghe close. Este juego marea y es bien estupido no lo descargen!! Dont download this game!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The only thing that I see is that there needs to be an opportunity to place the books in Reading order & to be able to add a few notes if the person wants!  REALLY the Reading Order is a MUST! To also be able to place them into Authors folders to access only that author is you want would be a plus that would be nice!!!! They do this on Amazon in the Wish Lists Why not be able to allow this in the APP!!!
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Neil Gaiman write a lot, for a lot of medias. But this means that he usually spent a huge amount of time beteween his adult books doing something else. We can't complain - everything he does is good. But it was a pleasure to see The Ocean at the End of the Lane  finally being released. I read it in few hours. It's fulled of wonders, magic and a wonderful child-like point of view. I loved every bit of it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun for all ages and the graphics are incredible! Highly recommended for horse lovers of all ages! Only downfall is that you can't switch over to another horse for energy
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great game it reminds me of mc. Only complant is there is not an area u can acrw around. But its great buy it for ur kids or ur self
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Very enjoyable summer read. Sophie kinsella has a great sense of humour, very funny and entertaining! Always good for a laugh.

B004SGWYVA|5.0|This is a great anime that at first look, I thought I'd hate and looked like just fan service. Thankfully, I was wrong. The fan service is making of itself. It is over the top fan service to kind of make fun of fan service in anime in general. If you can't tell that's a joke, this show has gone totally over your head. As far as zombie stories go, it's pretty solid. The writing is sometimes funny, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes sexy. It's entertaining, well animated, satirical in nature and points out cliches that are present in fan services anime as well as things found in zombie movies. It's like having you cake an eating it too. You get a good, entertaining anime, that also has lots of boobs and blood. Like my girl likes to put it, big boobs, hot chicks and zombies, what's not to love?
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a terrific show that I had never watched before being able to see this on premium plus for no charge.  The actors, plot, setting, and costuming are terrific.  I really care about the characters.  Really sophisticated drama/comedy.  Wish there were more like this instead of the silly situation comedies that seem to be so popular.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You have to read this book. It made me cry. The book is a little slow a first, but it gets better. Best series I have ever read.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Not for the faint of heart.  Excellent drama, excellent cast.  A view into a slice of life that most people would never see.  Watching this as a marathon can be depressing as we ponder whether anyone anywhere is honest and caring.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I didn't like the way it ended, I understand that you have to leave us wanting more but I felt it was to abrupt.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was great ! Too bad he had to eat her boyfriend to become human again. good thing her father could be reasoned with. They really do look good together :) What is &#34;R&#34;'s real name ??
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie. Super fun and fast read!  Can't help but be inspired by katniss and all she does.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|I got this for my brand new HTC One which I absolutely love.  This double flip case is pretty thin and slim and maintains the phone's pleasing dimensions.  As others have pointed out the cover does not have a clasp to keep it closed but it serves its purpose well enough for keeping phone in pocket next to keys etc.  The case looks pretty elegant with the black and red.  This is the first time I have ever used a case for any of my phones but the HTC One looks too gorgeous to be in my pocket with keys etc!  The stand is perfect for my toddler to watch videos when dining out etc and the HTC One's Kid Mode keeps the software of your phone safe while the kid is playing with it.  If HTC adds a clasp to the case they have a winner!

Should be 10 !
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I reinstalled again but it is still awful.  I uninstalled because I don't feel it is user friendly at all.  I liked the old format for the speed, ease and convenience of use.
1591840562|4.0|Great summary of how to approach your pitch to make your story understandable and compelling. Keeps you in the mindset of thinking like your target audience, potential investors.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Wonderful characters with delicious flaws and hilarious quirks make you cheer for each of them from beginning to end.  Life's triumphs and sorrows are laid out in an entertaining and page turning book that left me smiling.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great family movie, but don't forget the tissues.  Didn't even know about this movie on TV or in theaters.  Really Good on a rainy afternoon
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was different from some of the books I had been reading.  It was interesting to view events and hardships from an animal's point of view.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fascinating book. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait for the next one. Great male and female characters, interesting world, back stories that are slowly revealed, ancient magic. It has great elements to start with and is so well written. I did get a little frustrated jumping to POV characters in other parts of the world, but I have faith that this will come together to be an epic series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this app. We installed it on their tablets And I think it just became their favorite. Great job and keep the games coming.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This is the 3rd book in the Chronicles series. A masterpiece story about a family which  follows a major period of American history. It's full of nice folks and others full of deceit and treachery. The descriptions of time and place provide the reader with graphic images of the characters.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This in his usual style is heart rending but more interestingly it portrays the broader reaching tenticals of the Afgan homeland as its people settle in other parts of the world. Once again with Hosseini you become deeply involved with the characters. I stayed up very late reading this wonderful book.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This was a great read. All the characters have a life of their own, and very few are just plot devices. The whole world created is very detailed.  I loved the protagonist. She is one of the best female characters I've ever read in a fantasy novel.<br /><br />There are some plot twists that I saw coming a mile away, (though maybe that is intentional, for us to get information before the protagonist has it). The villain had an interesting backstory, but we learn very little about him before he is killed and he suffers from the pure evil psychopath trope. A lot of what is does is just out of a desired to do horrible things with no logical goal.<br /><br />It does have it's flaws, but I was so interested in the world and it's people that they did not ruin the book for me.I will be reading more by this author.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|He always writes such memorable characters. This was No exception. It made a great summer read. I look forward to the next book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Some friends told my wife and I about it.  We watched the first episode of the first season and we were hooked from there on out. For the next week, we watched all the episodes of all three seasons.  Wow, what a unsuspecting way to end the 3rd season, especially at watching everything pretty much back to back.  The writer(s) for the show is good. No wonder Downton Abbey has won so many awards across the pond. Great show, great actors, great story line.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Very Good! Thank U! I love this movie! I enjoy view this whit my friends and family! excellent! Dios mio no se q mas escribir!
B008PZ69T8|1.0|not worth the money.  just a gimmick.  I have higher quality recordings of the same. would suggest purchasing another copy of classics.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|I listen to PSB since they appeared in mid 80s and I own all of their releases, except for several compilations. In 'Electric', boys primarily focused on trendy hi-tech sound rather than music material. To make words easier to incorporate into the music they even changed the name of Bolshoi theater to Bolshy.<br />The quality of studio recording is top-notch. However, overall impression is a noisy Ministery of Sound type of house music with a little of what PSB were, except for Neil's vocal. Would give them 3 if they were not one of my favorite bands. A must-have for fans (to keep track of PSB works), but for others - may spoil an impression of the group, take money and space (if you buy a CD).
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|I decided to purchase this movie because I had seen the first one.  I wasn't disappointed.  Although it left it open for another installment of the same.  Most movies of this genera always do.  I enjoyed this movie and if you are a fan of the other G.I Joe movie you will like this one.  The special effects are 1st rate and the action sequences were great.  I don't think that you will go wrong getting this movie.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Very Good! Thank U! I love this movie! I enjoy view this whit my friends and family! excellent! Dios mio no se q mas escribir!
B002RXMG00|4.0|Right down to Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance, this is classic Hitchcock.  Quirky characters, long, suspenseful buildup, and a creepy ending.  There's no Tarantino-like gratuitous, gushing blood.  This is all about the characters.  It always amazes me how Hitchcock's films stand the test of time.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I am eagerly awaiting the next movie and I am trying to pace myself with the book.  I do not want to finish to fast.
B008220BLG|4.0|super cute movie way better than i thought it was going to be. made me laugh at times and hope for love to win
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Very Good! Thank U! I love this movie! I enjoy view this whit my friends and family! excellent! Dios mio no se q mas escribir!
B009LDMJGA|4.0|This review is for the vinyl pressing.  It's compressed and brick-walled; sounds worse than the CD.  Great music RUINED by the record company.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|It started out kinda cheesy, a bit cliche.  But it's getting better as I watch it. I like the rewinds that go back and tell about what happened on the island.  However, I think they spend too much time on the interpersonal stories between the main characters and not enough on the actual plot lines.  It almost seems the main plot lines become secondary.  Someone is always getting pissed at someone else and they end up making up by the end of the episode.  I think the writing could be a bit stronger.<br /><br />But I still love it.  God help me Stephen Amell is a friggin HOTTIE!!!
B0090SI4LU|4.0|great movie read the book awhile ago and  had been waiting to see it in the theaters. unfortunatlly i had to wait for the dvd. if you read the book then you already know its good.
B002AS463W|5.0|It is a Classic Movie and full of action.  I think you will like it if you never seen it!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I intentionally got the abridged version because I didn't have the time for the full version and it was a good purchase.  However, perhaps appropriately, I was left with the feeling of wanting more.  Major historical events are regularly glossed over in this audio book, so it truly is abridged.  The good news is that a few commutes to and from work can get you more or less up to speed on the book.
1608862771|4.0|I have bought many sketchbooks. This one is cool for the urban 'scapes. I'm an Urban Planner in a large city and liked the cover.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really love this game I play whenever I can and I love trying to beat my sisters high score the only problem I ever with is it wouldn't let me stay in the game but I figure that out pretty quikly u just have to upgrade it and it will be fine. anyway i loved trying to get new backgrounds and swords! I have managed to get them all but it took like three months in order to do it I had trouble with some of them and others just a while. whatever I totally love this game! u would be insane not to buy it
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Just buy it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />This album has been played through a ton of times in my vehicle.
B00AFPVPDG|4.0|I think that the book is okay in that it does provide good points on how to rapidly learn something, but there's not a lot to it.  Most of the book is filled with his personal examples rather new information.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an addictive puzzle game that tests your problem solving abilities!  It's not too hard to where you are just completely stumped.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I thought this app would be fun because everyone has it but its so boring!!! and it takes forever to load!!! this game shouldn't even be in the app store because its so terrible!!!! DO NOT GET!!!!!!!!!!
B0030FHP9G|5.0|I love this tape. It's now a part of my cassette collection! I have other Ozzy cassettes but this is my first Sabbath (cassette). Have not stopped listening to it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed watching this together.  I would not recommend it for younger children since there are a few very scary scenes that caught us by surprise, but should have known that was about to happen.  It is a sweet and fun tribute preqeal to 'The Wizard of Oz', although a movie format all of its own.  I would have liked seeing more about Tic Toc or mention of Gnomes.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This one really says it all. Just like Garretty<br />We are all on that long walk. Good job Mr. King.
B00943SQCI|3.0|I like this movie. I watched it and didn't expect it to be the greatest film ever. It was good for a laugh and gives a few.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I was absolutely astonished by the horror of these anecdotes told to the author by the only escapee who ever made it to the west.  I had read &#60;The Orphan Master's Son&#62; and wondered if the details were exaggerated, but this true account proves that things are that bad and worse.  It sounds like he's had a hard time adjusting.  I hope putting his tale out to readers around the world will help somewhat
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Watched this series on TV, and bought the DVD to re-watch.  Season 2 won't be out until January 2014, and can't wait..
0765357151|5.0|After reading the book I am angry to say the lest over the spin that &#34;Hollywood&#34; put on it for the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fast-paced & fun...the kids really seem to enjoy it!<br />The graphics are great and it feels like your really<br />a minion on the run :)
B007CSWMWM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, def&iacute;netely one of my favorites. I read it on two days, great life lesson learned.
0345803493|3.0|Not as good as the first book and the story should of been wrapped up with this one, do not bother with book 3 unless you just want to own the complete set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is just the right amount of challenging, and I love how you can move about the rooms to explore them!! I only wish there were more levels!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Too much extra blitz going on besides bingo.  Just when you start to get used to it, they want you to spend money to play.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The version is too comic book looking.  Not as easy to navigate with the goofy looking graphics.  Wish I could go back to the previous version but was automatically updated.  No choice.
0345803507|2.0|The story concept ran to long and jumped the shark with this one, the story line should of wrapped up in book two.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I was completely unable to look up anything. I would have had to read the entire book to get to a word. And, it takes up too much space.
B00821OX98|4.0|The Sci-Fi aspect is awesome and so are the plots! Character development is wonderful! And the action is spectacular! Overall great show!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading all 3 of the books starting with the first book, Bared to You!  I found the crossfire series to be so much better than the 50 Shades of grey books, definitely keeping me reading hours into the night- Sylvia Day sure knows how to write words to paper & spin a hot romance story between 2 highly charged up characters that make the pages sizzle - so happy to hear that a 4th book is in the works- cannot wait to read more  of Eva & Guideons love story!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What's not to love if you are a fan of S.O.A. I own all four seasons and can't wait for season 5 on dvd.
B002MFULQO|3.0|I learned a few more details about the conspiracy. At times the movie was a little slow. Over all I would watch it again.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game is awesome and it FREE I LOVE IT and i love the story about the girl and the ship
B004FEFZU2|3.0|I got this for my 3d set up and was looking for films to play this movie was ok not really impressed with the 3d aspects of the film but then again my set up isn't the best in world either.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun game to pass the time. My eight yr old son polices it and it's even fun for myself if I need a quick way to kill time :-)
B002413TY2|4.0|More great action and Stratham shines! The trilogy ends here, and I hope we get another sometime in the future.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This classic work did not leave you wanting.  It was especially nice since I got it free from Amazon Kindle downloads!
B00000IREA|5.0|what can I say fantasy plus get to see jane fonda naked so you really cant go wrong with this film a must see
0439023513|5.0|I started reading the first book because i found it  laying around and needed something to read.  A quick read but a powerful one.  Alot of the issues dealt with in this series are socially and politically relevant right now.  I cant remember the last time I was so thrilled and disappointed to finish a book/series.  I had a few issues with this last book.  the beginning felt too convenient but was perfectly explained later on.
0142403873|5.0|This book has quickly become a favorite in our house.  The story is about using your imagination and is such a fun story.  The video is a great buy too.  It is the book (exactly) in cartoon form and is really well done.
B00CO6QGCE|2.0|I bought this app because I read how good it was and it was awarded 2013 of something and it was free and I really wanted to play with something like this,but this kills your battery even if your not using it! Really I'm watching my battery level go down by ever 3 minutes. Plus you got to buy coins so you can unlock tools for the dj extras and member ship of some sort. And I do something cool with my music but when I'm done I can't seem to find the music! If it's a bug PLEASE FIX IT if not get a paid version with theses things fixed!!! But other than that it's kinda cool.
B004YJMQCS|3.0|this film was ok for the series the 3d aspect isn't the best in the world but neither  is my setup which is why I bought this their wasn't a lot of 3d movies to choose from when I bought my set up so I got this film because it came in 3d.
