B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game and its very fun when my kids are bored and when I am bored to. Lol  its lots pf fun for the whole family
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Everyone said you had to go through lots of ads....not me.  This game works great on fire. People should actually play a game before reviewing and give it a chance
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so fun. You have to match the tiles together. It is very entertaining! You should really get it! It is totally worth it!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A thinking mans game. Enjoyed the fact that you can shuffle the tiles and and continue to solve the puzzle.
B006ON41FC|4.0|takes a little time to get the hang of it. have to play a lot of games to get anywhere but a good way to pass time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|wonderful game! Love the game! Great graphics! The tiles are very versatile. I could get really addicted to this game and play forever...
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun for my son and myself. Easy controls and simple design. This is a simple game that is actually fun. Lots of goals to accomplish
B006ON41FC|1.0|don't force me to leave a review.  I don't like the game freezing up.  get rid of open feint garbage.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|out of all the apps i have this one is the best. i don't mind the couple ads in the beginning. works great on my kindle fire.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Even though it was free, the ads are a bit much. G5 Games should have known better than to spam people away from what could be a good game. No one should ever pay for this. There are plenty of other Mahjong games that are free. And it does work for Kindle Fire.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Connecting to a device through a serial port is not always easy with today's laptops, the older laptops had a built in serial port and you merely plugged the cable into the device and set the serial port parameters. Now to save weight and money laptops have USB ports and you can almost plug anything into these, but connecting to an older serial port used to be a real challenge.  However using this USB adapter made it easy again. Every device I wanted to connect to, professional sound DSP, telecom router, internal alarm system, all worked flawlessly. The prolific chipset drivers were available for Win XP, Vista and 7 and all 3 versions worked well.  It was nice that the drivers were included in a disk, but I did find an updated one for Win 7 on the web site.  I have wasted too much time with the cheap knockoffs and actually had one adapter damage the UART chip of a professional sound DSP device. Don't waste your money, buy this one and it will work flawlessly. Save your time and money and but this device because it works!  Plugable Technologies delivered on time as well, also if you buy a number of items then definitely explore becoming an Amazon PRIME member as the free shipping makes it easy to find all those small items you may not have purchased when the shipping costs were 25% of the price of the item.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is by far the best Mahjong app I have tried. It can be played as easy or as challenging as you wish. The interface is easy
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this version of mahjong! It is really nice that it does a full tutorial to help beginners like my little girl but also has harder levels for the more advanced players. Awesome
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game. After a while you get the hang of flying into the nuts and close to, but not hitting the trees.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app provides today's weather and also a two week prediction. On the &quot;today&quot; page you slide the screen to.the right to see hour by hour. Overall a nice, convenient app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game on the PC. It looks and runs great on my Motorola Droid Razr. I would highly recommend it to all mahjong fans.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game, great graphics ...I'm sure kids would love it.....there is a mandatory tutorial you have to go thru but that is short and cutesy......I saw a tab I could click to go see their other games, but I got none of the popups other reviewers complain about
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love it. It doesn't freeze up or anything! I Tried to get it off the Android market for free and it wouldn't let me go any further. I'm still waiting to see if this game is a scam too but Amazon apps usually isn't like that.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have played a lot of games and this one is very well made! I have really liked a lot of games this company puts out. if you buy from them you definitely get what you pay for and more!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. its soooooo adictive I play it all the time. I love the challanges. the feint is no prob. just coos no thx or turn off wi-fi duh.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I don't even know whether this headphone is good or not, and frankly i don't care. the packaging of this headset is the ABSOLUTE WORST i've ever seen. I almost broke my scissor and broke my arm trying to cut through the plastic sealed packaging. It's almost harder than steel.  DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT. You've been warned!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it! it works perfectly. I get tired of all of the same types of games but I always go back to solitaire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app I've seen. I love the red letter text! The feature I love most is that there are many different versions that can be downloaded and kept on my Kindle Fire. Highly recommend!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun and relaxing. not sure why others are complaining about ads they don't interrupt game play like some apps. besides if i like the game i want to know what other games they have to offer  I recommend this game to anyone who likes mahjong and just wants a relaxing game to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love how it reads with me.  I get more out of Bible reading lisrening while I read along.  Great for traveling...always have my Bible with me now. Love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This version is much superior to the Solitaire game on my computer.  It is easy to navigate, yet challenging.  There are several different types of solitaire available although I only play original solitaire.  The only drawback to this app getting 5stars is that after each hand, there is some sort of ad. I almost removed the app from my Kindle Fire because of the ads even though I love the game.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I LOVE this DVD!!! Over 20 of her best songs and videos from the 80's and 90's!! Includes \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", \\"The Greatest Love of All\\", \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and many more!! The Special Features are GREAT!! Interviews and additional songs!! I couldn't ask for a better Whitney collection!! :)
B0034G4P80|1.0|After seeing the cast of good-to-excellent actors, and somebody I would expect to be a strong director, this seemed to be at least promising.  The result, however, is a complete disaster.  Inane lines spoken with absurd posturing, truly ridiculous costuming, cliche after cliche after cliche, this movie is fit for 12-year-olds, 300 pounders who live in the parents' basement, or both.  Embarrassing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|liked it!  fun story line. very entertaining! nice graphics, fast. it moves nice on the kindle fire. challenging game that is fun for all ages. mahhong fans will enjoy this app.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love playing this game it is very very addictive.  And the best thing is it was free! great game!
B000LXHK22|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES OVER SIMPLY BECAUSE ITS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE --LIKE A GOOD BOOK U CANT PUT DOWN AND THEN U WANT TO READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN! I LOVE ALBERT FINNEY AND RUSSEL CROWE DOES A FINE JOB IN THIS MOVIE....AND ITS FUNNY TOO! ITS JUST A GREAT MOVIE---PERIOD!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire.  Fun to play.  I am really enjoying this game.  It's nice for these older eyes that you can zoom in easily and see the tiles better.
B006ON41FC|5.0|wildly addictive! I find myself playing every chance I get! Great graphics and sounds. Absolutely love it, got everyone in the house hooked!
0385344228|5.0|An outstanding novel. The format is unusal and very effective at drawing the reader into the story and characters, not the run of mill court room drama, you will not be disappointed.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game.  Lots of goals to shoot for along the way.  Who doesn't like to just go nuts from time to time?
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This is really a handsome cover. Looks like an old Leather bound book.  Have received many compliments. You won't be disappointed.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Always been a huge fan of Mahjong.  The only ad I get is when you turn on the game, just hit play and the ad is gone.  Works well on my fire.
B001KP2J3U|4.0|Watched it again for old time's sake and was still impressed with the acting and the mystery.  Agatha writes a good story and her characters are outlandish and entertaining, and our Inspector and Colonel Race do a superb job in solving the cases and bringing the culprit/s to justice. The land of the pharaohs and the long dark river add to the senses and feel of the scenario. I enjoyed it again with a bag of popcorn and several fresh mangoes.  A good flick to see again!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lots of fun on my Thrive! So far the ads haven't been a problem. If you like mahjong at all, grab this. It's a great time killer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Can spend a lot of time playing. lots of different games. just wish they would last a bit longer. but fun for the most part
B006ON41FC|4.0|the game was really fun but the add for rating it a 5 star would pop up in the middle of the game
B0067Q42BY|5.0|good game,  better than other mahjong games ive played. it has a story and great graphics.if you like mahjong, you'll like this version
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Extremely addictive.  Cant put it down.  I was thrillrded when I saw this was the free app of the day.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I get every single FAOTD.  This is one of the best ones yet as far as games are concerned.  The openfeint stuff is not an issue since it is unintrusive and easily ignored.  The focus for this game is the ease of gameplay, the fun, yet challenging goals, and the ability to upgrade with earned acorns.  I highly suggest this game for anybody looking for a quick, fun game with hours of replayability.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I happened to check this game out as my first download on the kindle. My wife loves this game. Graphics, music,  and gameplay is great. The game runs so smooth.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game a lot. I enjoy games that have quest modes and this one has a long journey to find the pieces of the artifacts to continue on the expedition. I have already spent hours playing this game and having fun.<br /><br />I also like that the Mahjong pieces change characters on them depending on which country you are in. The special tiles are fun because they help you speed up the game by clearing the board faster. I am playing this on a Kindle Fire and it is working fine. The graphics are very good.<br /><br />This is one of the games I have enjoyed getting. It is a time killer as you get into solving the puzzle as fast as possible and lose track of the clock. I also like how you can get bonuses for different attributes of your game playing skill.<br /><br />It is a large game at 43.78 MB but with so many levels, three game modes and very good graphics I can see why. This is fun and I like playing it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love it, me and my daughter take turns playing it! And the different gear and out fits make it fun!
0066214122|5.0|Imagine an enemy so small you can't see one of them but that has the ability to work together with other devices of its own kind as a team. The enemy then slowly evolves, increases intelligence, is able to replicate and improve on its original design. Over a period of time it improves itself so much that it is a threat to all life forms. Now imagine that you helped create it and you know it has escaped your laboratory and processing plant.<br /><br />Out of the imagination of one of the best Sci-Fi writers of our time, Michael Crichton, comes a story where mankind's quest for knowledge and the use of nanotechnology to build nanorobots may spell the doom of all life. Michael includes genetic engineering and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to make a predator swarm of nanorobots that attack their creators and simply want to survive.<br /><br />This is a good book and I was highly interested in its thought provoking concepts of maybe we can move science too far before we are ready to control the results.<br /><br />Maybe we are no longer the top predator in the world and we are the prey! I recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome. me and my sister love seeing who can gt the better score. we played for a good 30 mins before we knew it. it wool much fun. I would really recommend this to anyone who likes having a little fun with their family.
0545265355|5.0|Okay. First of all, I'm not a TWILIGHT hater. I don't love the books or anything but I never understood the mob-with-torches mentality about the sparkly vampires and their love object, Bella.<br /><br />I do hate Bella but largely because she doesn't actually exist. She's the worst possible role-model for young human beings of either gender for a host of reasons too numerous to go into here.<br /><br />I just want to get that out front to give everybody the proper context for what's next. I do not and have never hated TWILIGHT.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />I'm now 2/3 of the way through the HUNGER GAMES trilogy and Katniss Everdeen is, almost literally, the precise opposite of Bella. That alone would be enough to recommend this story but, above that is the superlative dystopian world, the crisp economical prose that perfectly immerses you in the  mind of this young woman who is, despite her scifi-ness, far more real, engaging and familiar than any sixty Bellas could ever hope to be. She is fantastic.<br /><br />I know I'm late to this party but there must be some who are even later. To them I say this: If you have a copy of TWILIGHT and a copy of THE HUNGER GAMES and are considering what to do next, my advice is to set a match to TWILIGHT and use the light of the ensuing fire to read THE HUNGER GAMES.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game, and although ive read a lot of reviews about the ads, I don't have them on my Kindle Fire. I'm very happy with this paid app for free :)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have always liked mahjong but most games I have come across are easy or just plain boring, but the quest mode is lots of fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There doesn't seem to be much to this game. Just keep playing and it will get better. I am kind of upset that you have to beat EVERYTHING before you can move on. I am currently stuck.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It is unusable on 4.0.3 Galaxy Nexus.  I can't put in any text for player name nor can I submit the default &quot;player&quot;.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent, seems like a great game,so far.<br />A cross between standard Mahjong and Mystery games!<br />Very Challenging!<br />I would buy more from this company.
B0071QIN00|4.0|its fun but it can also get annoying so ya I think its good but I don't know about u so ya
B005WMQ5R8|1.0|Such a bad movie, can't believe I had so much hype for that. Everything in this movie was terrible from the beginning to the end, only the animation was worth watching, I could put this movie in Russian with Vietnamese subtitle and it wouldn't change a thing because the story is so bad that it isn't even worth trying to understand wtf you are watching. I wish I could put -5 Stars.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love playing mahjong classic, but this new Mahjong Artifacts, keeps me playing! It's funny to follow the quest! Good idea!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so much better than the other Mahjong apps out there.  A real challenge and well worth the money!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is the best game ever its sooooooooo addicting and i love squirls too and i reccomend it to every one get it nowwwwwww
B0067Q42BY|5.0|good graphics and fun to play so far. I enjoy Mahjong but this makes it much better with a good story line to follow.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|halfway thru making this an ad free free app they made it an ad filled app. what a scam i hope no one else downloads this and encourages this detestable behavior
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Never played mahjong before. Polished game, very addictive. Nice to finally see a high quality app for faotd again. Not worth $5 but 2-3 bucks
B0067Q42BY|4.0|a lot of fun and simple so far. I recommend to anyone. I got it free for free app of the day bug worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun for the kindle fire no gliching. what so ever and fun games that keep coming I love this game
0783240287|5.0|Some childhood pieces don't hold up after all these years (I'm thinking about HR. Pufnstuf and co). But this does. A great production is captured here and the songs, moral, and plot are as lively as you remember. I'd recommend this to anyone who loved it as a kid- you won't be disappointed.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Ghost Rider was likely to be made into a movie... an animated feature would have worked.  Following the `how it all began' premise, Ghost Rider starts with Johnny Blaze and his  father performing at a carnival and making a decision that determines what life Johnny  will have.  The movie's incarnation of Johnny Blaze is older than in the comic book and  quite a risk-taker... leading to Ghost Rider, the judge, jury and executioner. I love  the flame effects of Ghost Rider's skull and the bike design was impressive.  Peter Fonda as the devil... who else was there?
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Got this app as a freebie on Galaxy Nexus. Seems good so far, no other Android Mahjong to compare it to.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I had some problem downloading this game on my Kindle, but it works fine now.  Great game to have when you have some down time.
0307938905|5.0|Night Circus is a fantastic, magical, mystical, incredible feat of story telling and imagination!  Jim Dale's theatrical experience and sensitivity bring alive the characters, the setting, the events, and the character of this tale of a Victorian circus.  It's been a long time since I've heard such a tale of wonder amd imagination.  The other reviews give great details so I won't repeat them here.  I will say that listening to this on my ipod, while I am laying in bed in the dark, I feel like I am there - when the sun goes down, the darkness falls, and the circus comes alive - I am there - thanks to Jim Dale's reading and Erin Morgensten's wonderful storytelling!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was the first app I had on my Kindle fire and its still fun and addicting I love it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its a difficult game cause all the amount of birds they give you with a massive amount of pigs to kill and find all golden eggs but its a fun game
B006ON41FC|5.0|In this app you are a flying squirrel who must navigate through the forest collecting all kinds of acorns for money so you can buy stuff to get more acorns and fly farther and farther into the unknown
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good Mahjong game! Especially for beginners. Good music and graphics. Works on HP Touchpad using CM7. Haven't tried with CM9 yet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My whole family has enjoyed this game greatly. The earning points to buy new games adds to the challenges daily.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it might be a little slow, but it is not stupid, or cheezy. I have played better games, but this one is pretty good
B006ON41FC|4.0|its pretty good and fun but one time I lost it on my apps and it wouldn't come on!it EVENTUALLY came back on
B005HSL626|5.0|it is awesome if some people think its crap no its really fun i would say get it you get to choose your knife and it is super fun it is not crap!!!!!!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love the graphics and the story line. One of the best Mahjongs by far!  l highly recommend. this version. Its even great for children learning to match up different colors.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a fun game. once you play you cant stop, that's how addicting it is. its good for all ages!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games!!! never get bored of playing them and they can be challenging but not too hard that little kids cant play.
B006ON41FC|4.0|A bit of a grind to get the better items, but it is still enjoyable and its fun for what its worth.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|glad I got it free on amazon app of the day.  tiles are easy to see, and graphics are good!

B006H3MIV8|1.0|I have listened to every song on this album twice, and other than a few covers that caught my attention, such as Lenny Kravitz covering \\"Rainy Day Women\\", I thought this was a terrible tragedy to the music of Bob Dylan. Allowing Miley Cyrus, Adele, and Kesha to do Dylan covers is dumbfounding. I understand the profits go to Amnesty International, but why did they have to use Bob Dylan? Couldn't they let these singers do Beatles covers instead? I suppose I am biased being a huge Dylan fan and loyalist, but I still stand by this review as the album not being worth the money if you like Bob Dylan singing his songs - not other pop singers and nobodies whom I have never heard of such as Steve Earle & Lucia Micarelli covering one of my favorites - \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\". To all Dylan fans - please listen to the album before purchasing. If you don't like it but still want to give Amnesty International money, just donate, don't allow this filth to sit beside your Dylan albums.
B0070CG1XQ|5.0|I bought this download based on the review in the March 2012 Gramophone review by Duncan Druce. I am not a musician, I am a music-lover and these performances are as good as Mr. Druce said they would be. I was not disappointed in the least. This is certainly one of those \\"must have\\" performances.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Kindle fire ....works great...can set up saved searches and sales and purchases with ease.  Would rather use my Kindle Fire than my laptop!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It was the free app of the day for my kindle fire. But I would have paid the $4.99. It's fun and I've found it to be very addictive. I would highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That's right feel like I've been on a three day bender.  Read all 5 in 3 days. Good work please don't stop here.  Considering the size of the world he has created I kept thinking there was no way he would wrap it up in 5 books.  To my relief he does tie up all the loose ends and you still can't wait for more.  Female protaginists are hard for me to get into, Jules is rock solid.  Post apocolyptic stories; too damned many these days. This one really stands out and turns into more than survival, includes exploration of the inner world right along with the outer wasteland.  Tension and suspence never let up; anybody can die at anytime, you will be deeply entwined with the ones you love.  Good work, Keep going and raise the price on your next Wool adventure you earned it and deserve it.  Thanks
B0067Q42BY|5.0|First time review for an app. This is fun! I like the storyline. I got bored with random mahjong. This makes mahjong fun again.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this game is well made and quite a bit of fun. the dev ads at the beginning cost it a star.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game, I like the story too. Good graphics, smooth gameplay, a quality game in general. If it hadn't been free I would have paid for it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great Game! Runs fantastic on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 with ICS 4.0.3 and my Galaxy Nexus! Like it much. Great animations and nice story gameplay. Got it as &quot;free app of the day&quot; but 4,99 is really okay for such a great game! Thank you!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very nice, enjoyable game.  has pretty graphics, and nice soothing music.  the puzzles are of good difficulty level: not too hard, but still take a bit of time to solve.  nice, relaxing game to play at the end of a stressful day.  and would probably be great for all ages, too.
B0042100OY|5.0|Three day delivery from Amazon of two copies.<br />I am a sponsor for several men in a Celebrate Recovery 12 step program.  Upon graduation I personally give each participant a copy of this book.  It is always read and shared by the men with their wives.<br />Well received and it makes a difference.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|The case fits very good! It adds a little weight to the phone but not too much! It makes me feel like my phone is heavily protected but still has the slim feel to it! Everything matches up to the phone, the lock/unlock button, the front and back camera fit perfectly where the cutouts are etc etc. The price is amazing i got mine for $19 flat plus free one day shipping! You cant beat that at all! Only thing i disliked was the screen protector is for the international version but i dont use screen protectors so im not in complete shock. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a case!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Greatest game of Mahjong I have ever played! This has become my favorite game! I recommend this game to everyone!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is the best app ever works great on kindle fire I would recommend this app to anybody get this app its will totally impress you take my opinion
B006W0QOF2|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  Ryan is like a new Man with no Name (Clint Eastwood westerns), the quiet good-guy criminal.  Anyone expecting a F&F actioner is going to be seriously disappointed (though why would you even WANT that??).  This is a movie about a man who does one thing very well, and his only attempt to reach out to normal society blows up in his face and goes horribly wrong, and now he's trying to fix things and preserve what he can't have.  Several action scenes are shot in a restricted way from his car, showing only what he can see, highlighting the fact that he's always on the margin of events, keeping his head low but at the same time not able to make any real connections to people.  There isn't much dialogue, and there are quite a few introspective moments that I think serve well to show off how he isn't a complete monster, and also showing off some of the more dingier parts of LA.  He actually cares about the people around him, but he's only good at driving and violent retribution and doesn't want them to see this side.  Even the mobsters villains in this movie aren't stereotypes.  They're nuanced people caught in a spiral that they hate themselves.  For example, I went the whole movie thinking Ron Perlman was being a complete dick, but in one sentence in the second half of the movie I realized why he's like that and actually felt sorry for him.  The soundtrack is a mix of great retro synth rock/pop, and ambient songs for the quiet moments, which I absolutely loved, though I wouldn't really recommend purchasing it separately.  A lot of the songs are great for the scenes, but taken out of context many of them sound very similar.  It's a low-dialogue movie, with scenes of tenderness offset by sudden and brutal violence.  It's not everybody's cup of tea, and I think some people have legit complaints about it since we're all different.  But I seriously question the taste of those who think it's \\"THE WORST MOVIE EVAR!\\", and I think they were just expecting another popcorn street racing movie.
B004478GNI|4.0|This is a great set, as a lot of people I really enjoy clone figures and this imperial pilot looks amazing, of course R2-Q2 looks great too but this is just R2-D2 in grey. The ship was bigger that I expected, but its a really nice toy, it has a very nice dark look, according to the imperial fleet in the original star wars. I'm giving 4 stars not for the toy itself which deserves 5 stars, but for the whole thing including its packaging (check next comment).  COMMENT ABOUT PACKAGING FOR LEGO: Lego has always done a very nice job with their packaging, bags come labeled with numbers, capes and other cloths come in little paper packages and the instructions couldnt be more acurate. But what about the stickers? Some people really hate stickers on lego toys, but more than that, is worst when the stickers come with all other items in the box and they just get a lot of damage and get wrinkled, so just out of the box the stickers are pretty much useless. I'm pretty sure that Lego will come out with a very nice idea to protect the stickers.  - Fernando
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought I would not be kept interested in this third installment. Actually, though the first volume remains my favorite, I gave this one 5 stars because it kept me interested throughout the whole book.  I don't like books with non happy endings but this one actually had a few strong messages that I shared. I recommend this series to all...
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it. controls are not quite as responsive as I'd like, but still pretty awesome. great concept. fun to play. wasted hours.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this app feels just like Microsoft office on my android.  works great with my Google docs.  I have not found any dislikes yet.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Have never read a book by this author before but the book was recommended to me.  This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It made me think about things and see things from a different perspective.  It made me laugh and yes, even cry.  You wont be disappointed with this book
B0061TQBRK|3.0|I have a few of Lacuna Coil's CDs, and after listening to some samples that Amazon provided, I was expecting something on the order of \\"Unleashed Memories\\", which is still my favorite. After listening to \\"Karmacode\\", and feeling like the vocal mix was not done very well on that one, (with vocals that seemed buried under the music too much) I was happy to hear more upfront vocals on \\"Dark Adrenaline\\". While listening to the album, overall I felt like the songs were good, and what I've come to expect from LC, but they are not quite as epic, atmospheric and compelling as songs from \\"Unleashed...\\" Also, I felt that Christina's voice doesn't, in some cases, have the same power and range that she showed on my favorite album (you know by now what I'm talking about). Andrea's vocals are fine, about what you'd expect, but somehow I'm a bit disappointed in Christina's voice. It's not terrible, but she can do better.  As a whole, the band is tight in musicianship and the songwriting is very Lacuna Coil. But in my opinion, the album is good, but it could be better. I'd give it 3 stars, and maybe I'd go 4 stars if Christina's voice were what I was hoping for.
0385344228|5.0|Although I know that William Landay is anything but a \\"new\\" writer, he is new to me, and he is WONDERFUL. I was drawn in by the first page. Mr. Landay weaves his story so tightly that before you know it you are captive in his web. More later when I'm done! I am SO glad that I won this book, I can't even tell you how exciting it is to add a \\"new\\" author to my shelves - Harlan Coben is one of my favorites, and Landay writes as well as \\"seasoned\\" Coben (let's face it, Coben has GROWN to be a \\"master\\" writer, he wasn't one with his first books, he was only good). Anyway, more later!William Landay<br /><br />I cannot praise this book enough, it's everything, intriguing, thought-provoking, and plausible. I'm so thrilled that I've recently seen this book highlighted on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other sites. He's climbing the charts like a fast train, and I recommend you take a ride. I was so impressed that I got copies for everyone in my sister's book club. All I ask is that Landay keep writing; I promise, I'll keep buying!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I wont even waste the time,  even if it's free.  ads in a paid app are enough of a reason for me.  Especially for such a hefty price tag
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great visuals, soothing music, and a fun twist to make it more adventure-oriented. There is an ad at the beginning but it takes about two seconds to click Play. I read a review on here that complained about the tutorial...are you kidding me? It's an integral part to ANY game...Great game, well worth a try.
B004P7CNE0|4.0|Sci-fi thriller taking place in a future where emotions are not tolerated. Good picture, atmosphere, and cinematography among a few cheesy elements and recognizable actors. Decent movie, worth a few bucks.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've never heard of mahjong before but I love this game! Awesome for kindle fire. Recommend to all. Get this app!:)

B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is like a mixture between temple run and jetpack joyride. this game is totally worth. 99 and it is amazing
B0073PZIYI|4.0|I'm surprised at the severely negative reviews on this film since it's significantly more watchable than I expected from reading them. Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) gives us another ingenious concept - lifetime traded as currency - and then builds an average script around it. It gets into the areas of redestribution of wealth (time) and alludes to evil corporations and billionaires (immortals) but gives us a pretty tame bad guy even by real life standards.<br /><br />Generally the casting is quite solid though somehow I don't put Seyfried and Timberlake together - I wondered if Cillian Murphy might have been better in the lead. The plot raises enough interesting questions between the action set pieces to keep you thinking, though with such a strong concept it could have been a Blade Runner-quality film with a total script revamp. Instead, I found myself reminded of pieces of other films like Bonnie and Clyde and Gattaca.<br /><br />Still, In Time is better than many films I've seen recently. If you like thought-provoking concepts, you might just forgive the fact it doesn't live up to the promise but does at least deliver an enjoyable ride.
B006ON41FC|4.0|cool game could be better. the game could be fun and not fun at the same time I read some other peoples ideas and they fell the same way. I am on my kindle fire so I do not know how it feels playing on a phone. :)
B0078JOAOI|4.0|The Walking Dead is written with such finesse that I can forgive the occasional lapse where it falls into talking heads drama or spends too much time recapping an event that just happened for the characters but for the audience was concluded months ago. The production quality, acting, special effects and general coherence is really very high quality so I keep hanging in there.<br /><br />I was seriously hoping - praying - that with an episode titled \\"Nebraska\\" that we would be leaving the farm. The Walking Dead has been at its best as the cast moves from location to location facing unpredictable challenges along the way. We've been in the farm vacation for a long time now. While it looked promising that they were about to be kicked off the land, the conclusion of this episode gives the landowner every reason to allow them to stay.<br /><br />Let's see what happens but if they don't get moving pretty soon this show could hit the brakes.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|Colin Farrell was fun as the vampire. He moves into a home in Vegas next door to teen Charlie played by Anton Yelchin. Charlie is suspicious of the guy and warns his mother played by Toni Collette to stay away from him. Toni Collette is one of the gifted actors of our time and is underused in this, but its still nice to see her doing a fun movie for a change.<br /><br />I saw the original which came out 26 years ago and thought it was ok. This one is better. While the original used more comedy, this one is darker, more horror and appropriate. It's well acted by the entire cast including the teens which you expect to find mediocre acting - not in this. They rise graciously to the challenge. One by one Charlie notices his classmates disappearing and it isn't long before he discovers that his neighbor is a vampire and not a nice one. That's when the fun begins.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|While it's become trendy to hate remakes, I've made a concerted effort to give each \\"reimagining\\" or reboot a fair shake. The Thing is not a bad film, bringing many of the effective elements from John Carpenter's version and adding a few of its own scares to keep the audience on its feet. The casting works, the pacing is brisk and generally it makes for an entertaining horror flick.<br /><br />Where it goes horribly, horribly downhill is during Act 3 (after the camp is destroyed) and we get into a ludicrous \\"2 Americans on an alien ship\\" routine. The showdown makes Will Smith uploading a computer virus in Independence Day look like the conclusion of The Usual Suspects. It literally drops all tension and becomes a dull CGI-fest that just doesn't do the rest of the film justice. And that's a real shame since the first two thirds was promising.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was fun and fascinating how each time you played a game you would unlock another game. I was never bored I was entertained.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is really awesome and I don't know why anyone would rate this a one star because it really a five star game
B00004ST9Q|2.0|They can be had but the cost is as much if not more than this set. From the Bodyguard album: 'I Have Nothing', 'I'm Every Woman', 'Queen of The Night' (Radio Edit) and 'I Will Always Love You' (original on Disc 1, remix on Disk 2). From the My Love is Your Love album: 'It's Not Right But It's Okay', 'My Love Is Your Love', 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'I Learned From the Best'. From the Preacher's Wife: 'Step By Step'. From Whitney: 'Love Will Save the Day', 'So Emotional' and 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'. From I'm Your Baby Tonight: 'I'm Your Baby Tonight'. And finally, from Whitney Houston: 'How Will I Know' and 'Greatest Love of ALL'.  'Fine' and 'Could I Have This Kiss Forever' don't exist in their original form anywhere that I could find where I could download it legally.  As for Disc 1, 'If You Say I Have Nothing' from the Bodyguard was the only one I could find of the remix's in original form.  I wish that Amazon and iTunes would press the recording companies for the ability and right to make original hits available to their customers, make it known that there is/are remixes for a song and let the customer decide which version they wish to purchase. Many, many songs that have been recorded are no longer available in any form, though many were mastered from their original vinyl albums to CD and in some cases into MP3.  We, the public, are the ultimate loosers. My guess is that even what I've been able to accomplish, to get as many of the original hits as possible, may become somewhat unavailable soon. It is very sad!!!

B00EZ7K51I|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE December 2013 2-DISC 25th ANNIVERSARY BLU-RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />Name-checked by the ludicrously-well-balanced readers of England's &#34;The Guardian&#34; newspaper in 2007 as their favourite-ever Foreign Language film - Giuseppe Tornatore's &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; was already the stuff of celluloid legend less than a decade after its release - and rightly so.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw it - I bawled my eyes out like a big girl's blouse - and it's been emblazoned in my heart and top five ever since. I make no bones about it - if &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; is the greatest film ever made (and the absolute people's champ according to the IMDB database) - then &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; is the most 'beautiful' film ever made - and my number two with a bullet.<br /><br />First aired in Italian cinemas in 1988 at 155-minutes - &#34;Nuovo Cinema Paradiso&#34; (its original title) was not well received at the box office. So edited down to a more manageable 123-minute length and given a shortened name - it was then re-presented by a terrified and weary Director at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989. The results were magical. The cast was literally cheered and applauded by hardened film critics as they walked from the screening to their hotel rooms. It won the Jury Prize at Cannes that year, then the Baftas, followed by the Oscars and subsequently garnished some twenty-plus awards in Europe alone (they run like a role of honour before the film starts)...<br /><br />Told in flashback and subtitles - an elderly Italian lady phones her son in Rome who is now a big movie director. A local man has died and his funeral is the following day - she feels he must attend. Failing to get through - her daughter who is sat beside her mum reasons that maybe he's doesn't want to remember - after all he's been away from home for over 30 years? But as she dials again - mother insists - Salvatore will make an exception for Alfredo. When the middle-aged but still devilishly handsome Salvatore Di Vata lies on his pillow beside his beautiful young starlet partner in his suitably plush apartment - the camera closes in on his guilty face as he remembers who and what got him there...<br /><br />And so the story begins - we're introduced to Salvatore as a precocious young 8-year old boy (nick-named Toto) who lives in the small Sicilian coastal town of Giancaldo. As his mother Maria stoically waits for her husband to return from the Russian Front of the Second World War - she darns socks and makes ends meet (subtly played by Antonella Attili). Meanwhile Toto sneaks away from his alter-boy duties with the town's priest - the hotheaded and sometimes comical Father Adelfio (brilliantly played by Leopoldo Trieste) to his real obsession - being with the wily old Alfredo in the projection booth of the local flick emporium 'Cinema Paradiso'. Childless himself, but big-hearted to a fault when it comes to the permanently inquisitive boy - Alfredo is a surrogate father to Toto and a hugely positive influence in the child's formative years (veteran French actor Philippe Noiret putting in a towering and endearing performance).<br /><br />But more importantly - Alfredo makes Toto feel wonder. All those glamorous movie stars and the exotic locations they inhabit - their fabulous lives with all that possibility. Then there's the community who gather in the cinema - characters who spit - kids who drop spiders down the open mouths of sleeping patrons - hookers who sell their wares in the booth at the back. Onscreen there's Edward G Robinson gangsters - John Wayne cowboys - Charlie Chaplin comedians - gunshots followed by laughter (a few in the back seats of the cinema are timed to match those onscreen). And in between the feature films are newsreels that show war and horror and political change - but somewhere else. Then there's the really good stuff - like love and kissing and sex - if only the priest didn't vet it out with the shake of a bell (&#34;Twenty-years! And I've never seen a kiss on screen!&#34;). And as he peers out through the carved lion's mouth beneath the projection booth onto the gathered patrons below basking in that swirling combination of light and cigarette smoke - Toto gobbles it all up. Until one evening when Alfredo does the crowd a favour and the highly flammable film stock catches fire and changes the course of everyone's life...<br /><br />Although accused of being a little over romanticised in places (young women wash their hair in fountains, happy kids carry books up school steps in glorious sunshine) - Tornatore is saying that this is an Italy of old where things seemed simpler. There are inkwells in school desks and children have their heads shaved in public to rid them of lice - but there's also laughter in the town square as people gather of an evening. And as the movie progresses with the decades - so some of that innocence and community is brutalized and lost (the final fate of the building itself, the town lunatic still prowling the square that no longer seems quirky but sad). &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; is also funny and poignant - a lot. The teacher banging the dullard kid's head against the chalk blackboard because he can't get his sums right - night-student Alfredo trying to skive answers off Toto as he sits an exam that only young children should be taking - the town lottery-winner who looks up at the burned-out shell of a building and thinks I can rebuild this...<br /><br />But it's the relationship between Toto and Alfredo that drives the movie and is full of remembrances and sweetly observed moments. The scene where the child Toto rides in the basket on Alfredo's bike down the hill towards the town will make many think of the love they feel for their own parents. Toto then grows into a handsome 18-year-old who falls madly in love with a girl who gets off a bus as he's filming. Agnese Nano plays Elena and while Salvatore's initial advances are spurned, the beautiful Elena eventually comes around - only to have their love parted by fate and a banker father with other ideas for his daughter (their story as adults is considerably fleshed out in the extended 'Director's Cut'). Finally - the young Salvatore is told to leave this dead town and curdled past behind - go forward and create - never look back. Alfredo loves him enough to make the ultimate sacrifice - let him go - be his own man. The later half of the film is admitted very sad (especially the crushing of dreams) - but on it goes to an end-sequence that is quite possibly the best cinema has ever made (the celebrated `kissing' sequence).<br /><br />25th ANNIVERSARY ISSUE:<br />The 2009 single-disc BLU RAY contained the 'Theatrical Version' only and 'some' of the extras from the 2003 4-Disc DVD box set. This new 2-disc &#34;25th Anniversary Edition&#34; BLU RAY released Monday 16 Dec 2013 has both the 'Theatrical Version' (124 minutes) and the 'Director's Cut' (174 minutes) which extends the story of the older Toto massively. The print has been literally frame-by-frame restored with the liner notes telling us that thousands of instances of hair, dirt and scratches have been removed with damaged frames fixed and density and stability issues corrected. The film was shot in European Widescreen which is aspect ratio 1.66:1 which means that on a modern widescreen TV - there's skinny black bars on the left and right sides of the picture frame (they are very small and don't really intrude that much). The audio is also majorly restored with both Italian 5.1 DTS Master Audio and 2.0 Stereo mixes really bringing out the beauty of Ennio Morricone's magnificent score and the film plays in the Italian language with English subtitles to the bottom of the screen (optional on or off). In fact in appears that this major release has only ENGLISH as its lone Subtitle (odd that). Although digital technology was used in restoration - care was taken to keep all the original issues in place. All in all it's an exemplary handling of the film.<br /><br />But as I suspected - the restoration goes both ways - producing results that are both GORGEOUS and in some cases worse than before. Filmed in 1988 on a less than monstrous budget - the wildly varying picture quality as locations jump and change is now ruthlessly shown up. One moment its glorious with shots of full-on Sicilian summer sunshine - children running through the town square to school - the funeral procession on the hill with donkeys - Elene kissing Toto in the rain by the river as the thunderstorm breaks - these are truly beautiful to look at. But once you get indoors the grain and fuzziness is incredible at times. The opening shot of the elderly mother phoning Salvatore is a perfect example - beautifully framed and now massively improved - but then it instantly turns to the daughter at the table - and the grain and picture disappears into an almost unwatchable fuzz. But I must stress this - I've seen this wonderful movie so many times - and at last &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; is truly shining like a diamond. It's just that those expecting visual miracles here may be somewhat disappointed - and should allow for what they had to work with.<br /><br />The outer glossy card wrap with lovely new Toto artwork (so easy to smudge) houses a 3-way foldout inner digipak with a 32-page colour booklet. Both the card box and the booklet are a joy to look at with new liner notes by Italian film expert PASQUALE IANNONE, colour stills of set outtakes, reproductions of the two posters and huge amounts of info on the cast, the film's history and the restoration process.<br /><br />Fans will recognise the &#34;A Bear And A Mouse In Paradise&#34; and &#34;The Kissing Sequence&#34; features from the 2009 Blu Ray reissue. Both are hugely informative and entertaining featuring interviews with the cast and director - a history of the film and how the famous montage of scenes at the end came about (naming each source fim). But the new 52-minute documentary &#34;A Dream Of Sicily&#34; is odd to say the least. It features home footage from Director Tornatore and is mostly about him and Italian political corruption at the time and although it features clips from other movies (with Paradiso occasionally referenced) - the whole premise seems wildly out-of-place and self indulgent to a point where it's a chore and has little to do with the movie or its celebration. There's also the feeling that all Sicilians are stark raving mad - and that's where they get their 'dreamers' quality from. Although credited as featuring Tornatore - the Commentary (which is only on the 'Theatrical Version' and not the 'Director's Cut') features MILLICENT MARCUS speaking alone. She's a Professor of Italian at Yale University and Author of several books on Italian cinema. Her delivery is scholarly and full of dry details (some of which are obvious) but it would have been far more insightful if the actual filmmaker himself was telling us what's going on and why.<br /><br />Lumping in almost a full hour's worth of extra material - the &#34;Director's Cut&#34; is a strange and unwieldy beast. As a lover of the film - I ate it up - but others will inevitably find it overly long. What you do get is a huge amount of hole-filling scenes that focus on the young adult lovers Toto and Elena and what happened next (why they parted). But more importantly it properly fleshes out how Alfredo truly set Toto free by pushing him out of Giancaldo to his destiny as a movie maker. I haven't watched this long version in years but it was fab to return to it - especially looking this good. The subtitles are again only in English the audio has the same two settings as the shorter version. The lone extra (if you could call it that) is the trailer for the 'Director's Cut'.<br /><br />Why does &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; resonate with audiences so much? I can't help but feel that it's the poignancy of the loss as much as thejoy that touches us. Young love - young dreams - still fresh - still uncorrupted by life and its disappointments. The famous 'kissing' sequence that ends the movie sums it up best. It was apparently shown to the actor Jacques Perrin (who plays the adult Salvatore) without him knowing what he was going to see. His reactions of being blown away are real - and we in turn were exactly the same when we first saw it - blown away. Frankly Scarlett - if you're not in floods of tears by the time that sequence ends - check your pulse, you could already be dead...<br /><br />&#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; is a masterpiece - and sure this 25th Anniversary BLU RAY reissue of it is a little flawed (could have included the soundtrack lads) but I have to say that re-watching it looking all sparkly like this has been a joy for me. I cried like a sop again - and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Beautiful and then some.<br /><br />PS: make sure you use the actual Barcode in the search box on Amazon to get the 'right' issue - the 'UK and Europe' 25th Anniversary Edition BLU RAY is 5027035010557 and is REGION B LOCKED (US buyers need an All-Regions player)oration goes both ways - producing results that are both GORGEOUS and in some cases worse than before.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie. I did read the book and it was great and that is why I wanted to see the movie which I will  watch over and over again.The movie itself shows you the relationship between the white Kennedy south homeowners  and the maids who are black and how the maids are so mistreated at least by most of white homeowners. Emma Stone  who gets a job as a writer wishes to write a book on how the maids are treated. And Viola Davis who playes one of  the maids is a great actress. Emma Stone is fantastic as well all the other great actors in this movie. I really  would recommend this movie highly to anyone who wants to see a touching, at times funny a just a great movie with  a great message .Amazon is a great website to purchase great movies etc. . Thank you Amazon.    Carmela S Maggio

B004HW7JMO|5.0|I was a big fan of Lucy Lawless in Xena: Warrior Princess so Spartacus was appealing to from the start. I wasn't a huge fan of Spartacus at first because I thought it was too slow in the scenes that weren't action orientated. While Andy Whitfield's charisma was certainly missed, I thought Gods of the Arena was an overall improvement on Blood and Sand.  What really made Gods of the Arena was the increased focus on the characters. It took a little while to get accustomed to the kind of storytelling that Blood and Sand used, but you really get a feel for the characters in this one.  John Hannah and Lawless make this prequel well worth your while. I don't generally like prequels and this looked like a load of filler from the start, but that ended up not being the case. The writers got over the loss of their lead actor, which generally cripples shows.  If you liked Blood and Sand, you'll love Gods of the Arena. If you haven't seen Blood and Sand, I still think there's something to be enjoyed about this series. It's an overall better series which might enhance your enjoyment of the first one.
B000PC6A3E|3.0|First of all, great movie.  Now, for those of us who have had issues with their bluray copies as I have, try this: The minute you see the FBI warning, press the \\"menu\\" button (make sure you press the right menu button. You want to get the the movie's menu. Not your bluray player's menu.). That works 8/10 times.  I've bought three different copies of this movie. 2 directly from amazon.com brand new and sealed!!! On my third try I bought it used in \\"very good\\" condition. Still wouldn't work so I just started playing with the buttons and discovered the trick. For all the hassle I went through, I went with a 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry WB. You messed up when pressing these blurays.  Hope that helped.  Other than that stupid issue, this is a great movie with a great origin story, great acting, music, action... you get the point.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Colorful tiles and scenic backgrounds. Plenty of options for game play and level.  &quot;Special &quot; tiles along with quests add extra interest.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app. its a perfect time waster. there's one thing that bothers me, when its game over, you cant just click play again. you have to click out and click back in.

B00280LYIC|5.0|this book is so amazing. i read the lightning thief and i couldnt wait for the next book to come out. its a great book.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|this is one of the best movies i ever saw. the acting is superb. speechless. id like to see more films of these actors. the plot is somewhat cliche but isnt. i know it's contradictory but what can i actually say? it's fresh. it's wonderful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is awesome I love it I play the game every day it is my favorit game all the games are really fun but some of the games are hard but still fun
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a very good ending book of the epic series. the action is nearly never-ending but i was nearly crying at parts of it because of occurances that most other authors would not dare trying to incorporate in their books. I cant say that it wasnt written beutifully and I think that the story was expertly written with enough creativity to make a pig grow wings.
B00472OBYI|5.0|Este libro tiene un gran contenido bibliogr&aacute;fico y casos de estudio que son interesantes para todos los que desean estar al tanto respecto al impacto social que tienen las redes sociales hoy en d&iacute;a.<br /><br />Esto cambia la perspectiva de ver las redes sociales tanto a nivel personal como profesional. Es importante tener en cuenta que a&uacute;n cuando las culturas pueden ser diferentes, existe un impacto similar en todas.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I bought the entire set from Best Buy because i didnt want to wait the 2 days for shipping and wanted to watch it right away.  Well I had read the reviews that the bonus features were very limited but  i was still amazed by the laziness of warner brothers in that the collection is literally just the first disc from each blu ray set.  The sixth movie even says straight up disc 1- movie.  Now although i do understand costs and such i feel like they could have at least gone 1 extra step and printed a different label for each and possibly matched up some menus to make it seem like the movies should all be together.  hopefully they do a better job when they come out with the big collectors edition at the end of the year.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|great video on the history of RUSH  great sound and video quality  recommended for all RUSH fans & their wives !
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is just like temple run and jet pack joyride combined this game is awesome and I was a lucky one who got this app for free but u shuld still buy it for 99 cents
B0063GORYU|3.0|Ads are a real pain - they come up after each hand. About ready to buy the paid version if there is one. Good game if not for annoying ads.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Simple but fun. You can make lots and lots of cool designs. The designs go across many different planes. X2.

B004QWKIYQ|5.0|I love this album.  It was worth the extra few dollars for the bonus tracks. I would reccomend buying this version when compared to the basic version.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Good game, runs a little slow {galaxy s 2}. but my main question: why in there world would a paid app have ads?
1932735410|5.0|I received the book before the estimated deliver. I recommend this book to all the people who want's to take the PMP exam.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Haven't played Mahjong in ages, got this as free app and now I'm addicted ...glad I tried it! You should too!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I have to admit, I watched it because I like the guys in it..but I knew it was not a goofball movie.  I have to say, I am not a \\"Birder\\" but I really, really enjoyed this movie. It is a sweet, funny movie, with a good message.  Jack, Steve and Owen were perfectly cast, and the soundtrack is wonderful.  I say it is worth an hour and half of your life.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I got a huge kick out of this fantasy movie. I love foreign films and so subtitles are no problem here, and I love to get an insider's view of another culture, in this case, Norway's. The settings, from tumbling waterfalls and angry wintery mountain tops, to road side rest stops and campgrounds are at least as cool as the CG to this virtual traveler. The story is about a college age film crew who seek out a forbidding loner who is rumored to be a bear poacher. Instead, the man, gruff and ex-military, turns out to be a disgruntled government worker, whose job is to cover up the bloody mayhem Norway's trolls occasionally cause.  The handheld documentary style is used to advantage, but not to the point of nausea. Like the Blair Witch film crew, the kid's adventure doesn't end well, but there was plenty of humor. Norwegians, it seems, tell Polish jokes, and governments and their functionaries appear to have the same problems, from inane reporters, red tape, and endless forms to fill out, the world over.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I cant dolod this game it donset let you I want my money back it Stine never get it this app nevers Dolores this app it is the where's game app wherever the move his good Sept the app stinks it is stiled the app the move is bereter Sept the app stupefy  d!!!!!!!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Noah reviews this beyblade:  \\"I love this beyblade because it has 2 modes. And it has an awesome spinning tip. Plus, the beyblade launcher looks cool.\\"
B006ON41FC|4.0|It is an awesome game but maybe if they could make it a bit easier. Though it is really fun and addictive, you really want to beat your high score so you could be playing for hours
B006TJXZ30|5.0|The default mail client connects to live mail but as a pop account. LAME, since I want my mail synced on my windows phone, outlook and kindle fire. This app does the trick. When a calendar is added to this app it will be perfect. In the meantime, if anyone knows of a calendar app that taps into the fire's calendar data let me know.
0440244412|4.0|I spent half this series being irritated and the other half being confused. This book finally gave me some answers! The twists and turns were unexpected and the end was satisfying.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Cards move fast.  Just touch a card and it will move to a legal spot.  Cute card dance when you win.  Beware, addicting, but I love it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very fun game.  It makes you want to continue playing so you can collect all the artifacts.  Love how you can manipulate the screen also.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw a preview for the upcoming Hunger games movie and was so intrigued I had to learn more, and this is where from under my apparent rock I learned that there was a trilogy book set for the Hunger games.  With great excitement I turned on the wifi for my Kindle and speedily downloaded the three book set, with a cup of hot tea in hand and cuddled up in my favorite chair I began to share the journey of a young girl just trying to survive the world she was born into and keep her family safe.  Like all great tales I was pulled into the story, as if watching a movie in my head I walked with Katniss as she prepaired for the reaping. I waited anxiously for the names to be called and I sat in shock and horror when Prims name was pulled. So to avoid spoilers I will not detail all the events I have survived through with Katniss but I can say survive is the word. I have cried, laughed and, and even screamed at my book in horror when something happened. I have been glued to the printed pages before me like an addict desperate to know what will happen and if every thing will be ok. I am 30 years old, I am a mother, and a wife to a military man, and I can say this book set is not for kids, and pushes the boundaries for anyone under 16, and should be a mature 16 at that.  It is a wonderful, addicting book set that tells an epic tale of survival, hate, war, revenge, loss, friendship, loyalty, love, forgiveness, and most of all hope. By the end you feel torn and bloody, dragged through horrors that we all hope to never have to face, and yet you feel hope because as bad as it gets the characters never give up.
B006ON41FC|5.0|super fun game, with fun goals to reach. it is worth getting even if it is just used to pass time!
B0043WHRWA|5.0|There are lots of detective shows on TV, including NCIS, CSI, The Mentalist, etc. but the combination of characters in 'Castle' really steals the show.  The whole show, including Castle's partner, daughter, mother, etc. all make for an outstanding series and hope it stays on for years to come.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Really fun toy. Wish there was a live wallpaper version of it! Great way to kill time. Colors are fun.
0385535139|5.0|We have collected a number of his books through the years and The Litigators is one of his best.  Thanks for making it so easy to obtain.
0375704027|5.0|Anyone who has read other books by Haruki Murakami such as A Wild Sheep Chase or The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, may be surprised by the tone and subject of Norwegian Wood, as this is not nearly as surreal or dark as those other books, however this is still very much a Murakami novel. The plot is simple, a now middle aged man hears Norwegian Wood playing and he is soon lost in a nostalgic rush of memories about the first serious love he experienced while in college. The action of the novel takes place during the late 1960s in Japan, a time that mirrors closely the '60s in the United States (student unrest, rock music, etc). The beauty and melancholy that the writing exudes quickly engrosses the reader into the relationship and thoughts of the characters. While this is a tragic love story it is also beautiful, like a soulful dirge. This is also a much more accessible and easy read then the Wind Up Bird Chronicle, in particular. This is certainly a must read not only for fans of contemporary Japanese fiction or fans of Murakami but also for both serious and the more casual readers of adult fiction.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very fun long lasting game. purchased on a snowy Sunday and it made my day enjoyable. like the preface to each new game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game it is always a game that I suggest to people the difficulty level is pretty good for this type of game as well.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|Quite simply an abomination. A disgrace to the legacy of Robert E Howard! Robert is not merely rolling in his grave, he has drilled through the other side of the earth and reached escape velocity!
0307593495|2.0|No more Henning Mankell for me. This meandering book took too long to reach it's conclusion, the character Wallender I no longer find interesting. I'm done.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Between advertising their other games in the news section, automatically enabling openfeint, and pandoring for reviews, these developers seem more intent on writing a virus than a game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun, simple game that is very addicting. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who Just wants./to have some thing to do to just pass time
B0067Q42BY|4.0|graphics are pleasing. game play works. auto zoom help on smaller screens. i see some lag on tile removal on droid bionic
B006ON41FC|3.0|Gameplay itself is fun, although more, cheaper permanent upgrades would be nice. Feint in itself isn't a bad thing, but in this game it causes lag and keeps you from interacting with upgrades until your scores are submitted. Also, repeatedly asking to rate a game 5 stars is highly obnoxious.
B003L77GG0|5.0|There have definitely been times in the previous couple of seasons where I felt like Smallville may have outlived its best years. But this last season really brought its A game back! I think my favorites will still be among the earlier seasons (I miss the wonderful friendship/threat of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor so much) but this one is very strong and I'm glad the series went out on such a good note.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is the best mahjong game I have ever played. I love G5 games, I have and allways will love the G5 apps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the adds are only from applications from the same dev if you haven't noticed (maybe I'm wrong but that is what I have seen)<br />this game's quality is absolutely magnificent and I think that people that have purchased the game may want to see high quality games like this, I agree that the &quot;more apps&quot; button may be more appripiate for a five dollar purchase, but think about this : His hard is to tap the screen one extra time to move to the main menu?
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|If you never played Final Fantasy 7 then first you must watch the recap that is in the special features. Its very well done, taking the best parts of a long game and giving you the condensed version. Without knowing the events of the video game you will  have a hard time following along.<br /><br />The 2nd half of this movie is where the action is just so you know. And if you want to prevent constantly slapping your forehead with your palm then leave the Japanese voices on and turn on English subtitles. The reason I'm giving the movie 3 stars is because the English voice acting is atrocious. It sounds like the majority of the actors were just reading off a sheet of paper, utterly unaware that there is a motion picture attached to what they are doing. Hardly any emotion is displayed and even Sephiroth sounds monotonous, robotic and just plain bored with the events going on around him.<br /><br />I'd write about the plot but why ruin it? If you like FF7, think Cloud is the ultimate cool good guy and Sephiroth is the only video game villain worth talking about, you'll want to see this movie. It takes a while to set up the story and some of it is predictable but much better than the plots of FFXII and FFXIII.<br /><br />The visuals in Advent Children are the definite highlight. Nobuo Uematsu's score is sweet love being made to your eardrum. Too bad the English voice acting is the vomit on your face that you end up feeling forced to forgive during that sweet eardrum love.
B0058VW36U|5.0|ok I love this game it is so fun I could play it forever it is so worth $0.99 if you do not have it get it now no joke get it that is a order!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty cool each game is simple yet fun and challenging. it makes you want to play more.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Not the best game in the world no way it would cost any thing because it is not fun citing fruit in the air and then citing a thing and boom the game is over so don't. wast time on it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome game! Love dodging the trees and collecting nuts. Openfeint isn't that bad.<br /> Everyone is such crybabyies. I love the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thought the game was pretty cool and really fun. I play it all the time. I also like how you can customize the backboard and card backs.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is one of the most underrated films I have stumbled across.  With stunning scenery, amazing acting, a script which somehow blends two parallel plot lines seamlessly, and so many little surprises for those who can recognize the many art and culture references, it is unlike any other film which I can think of.  It is especially rewarding for fans of Salvador Dali as it seems to be almost an homage to the deceased artist.  It is similar in many ways to the films of Wes Anderson and also Guillermo del Toro; Wes Anderson because of the deep human themes at the root of the film and the ironic way in which these are presented and Guillermo del Toro because of the surreal, fantastical nature of the film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and awesome very addictive love it and takes time hey it is snowing yeh it has a weird name 101 games + 20
0062082353|5.0|Excellent book. It goes into detail just enough that you want to see what is happening next. The book lets you in on how his wife accepts his job
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love the graphics Love the graphics, the storyline, ease of play, challenges, music  Love the colorful graphics, storyline, music,ease of play, and concept.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The Kindle Fire is awesome! So I thank Amazon for creating it. But this case is definitely worth it. it goes very well with the kindle. Fits so perfectly, it has a good grip when its on your hands so it has a really nice feel to it.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Ads? Really? This game isn't nearly good enough to pay $5 and still deal with ads. Poor form G5, poor form.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|So I've heard about Adele for so long now, I was really turned off by the name alone because I had imagined another media-driven artist such as Lady Gaga that I'm just sick of hearing about... boy was I wrong.  The songs are ridiculous in every way, her range and depth of vocal power is world class and possibly the best I've heard from my generation and I can't think of anyone even close.  I'm not a woman, but the lyrics still resonate with me just the same.  If you don't feel somewhat emotional on at least 1 of these tracks, then you probably haven't had many life experiences and lucky you.  I've been listening to this CD every day for a few weeks now and have watched the Live performance at Royal Albert Hall probably 10 times, it's just mesmerizing.  Google that Live performance and watch some video on YouTube of it, this will help make up your mind about buying the CD if you're on the fence.  Buy It.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|different kind of game. just started playing it and not as addictive as other games. i'll give it 4.5 stars if I could.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Things get progressively more difficult so there is never a dull moment.  My kids love to play this game but they have a hard time getting it away from me.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Mahjong should not have ads or &quot;power tiles&quot; or a stupid &quot;storyline&quot;.  I'm giving it two stars because I could turn off the music, and it does allow for zooming to see the tiles clearer.  If anything, I would call this Mahjong Lite.  And Superman75 has a good point . . . why are there two g's in mahjong on the title page?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|be careful you might not want to put this game down. I haven't applied the update as others warned and probably wont. have fun
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've always liked mahjong but it can get old.  This is a nice twist to an old fav, an since I got it as the free app of the day it's even better.
B0026PW67W|2.0|now, I want to start out by saying that the Marauders Map in the movies is a magical object(for muggles,read, Special Effect) and this does appear very close to the one depicted in the movies, but the one I purchased lacks continuity. No one level of the school is depicted. Many things, such as the classrooms, the dorms, Dumbledore's office etc are not listed. while the map makes a great conversation piece, it isnt terribly illuminating as to the layout of Hogwarts.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was doing fine for awhile until I realized what I was reading was \\"inane repetitive dialogue\\" to quote another reviewer. I normally like legal thrillers but this was too much to bear. Good editor needed!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is really fun. i love all tile games, especially the majong series. so i think that you should get this game while its free.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Unreliable. Would set alarm night before but the alarm only rang once in a while. Don't know why. Tried to use it numerous times but failed more often than not. :0(
B000EBD9TY|5.0|There is no more important performance in twentieth century film.  Brando changed everything in this role.  Humor, sexuality, and menace never were more real or beautiful. Magnificent!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great graphics and a lot of fun, I recommend it. my three year old son and I enjoyed it from our first time playing it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It is so addictive and awesome!!! I would recommend this game to anyone.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i love getting to different levels and becoming a differant nut.  this game is just so so so so so so so so so great
0307270807|5.0|A literary masterpiece by a very gifted writer.  Michael Herr really relates the time, place and environment.  Read this book if you're interested in the Vietnam War.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have been looking at this one for a while. But now that's free I'm am really excited. Haven't tested it on my Toshiba Thrive. It does look great on my Droid X2. A must have overall.
0345528581|5.0|This book is excellent for so many reasons and is very concise and to the point. This book has the RIGHT following concepts!! I know, as I have been on an overall health and fitness journey since 2007. I am a 40+ year old who works hard, travels, fights the belly fat like most middle-aged folks and does not have a lot of time like most.  (1) First about nutrition: Mark is right, eating smaller meals (5-6) each day is better for your metabolic rate (keeps your body fueled and  burning calories all day long).  Eating good food in the right grams/amounts of protein, carb and fat and proportions is right on.  Fad diets don't work. Calories AND WHAT you eat are both important. We should eat little to NO processed food (eat the basics: chicken is chicken, rice is rice, spinach is spinach - you shouldn't have to guess or wonder what is in your food). I will add that preparing meals on the weekend for the week (oatmeal, chicken + veggie + sweet potato baggies, hard-boiled eggs, etc) is an excellent practice toward eating the right things and moving toward healthier food.  (2) This book is great for the traveler or someone who wants to supplement what they are already doing for fitness and health. The exercises can be done anywhere without gym equipment - no kidding!  (3) This book is has many great exercises and the varying workout plan levels are awesome. They totally reduce the boredom of any exercise program and the various levels of workouts give you something to work toward (from Beginner to Intermediate to Master to Chief!!) I just finished my first 30 minute workout by Mark Lauren and already feel that I have used muscles that I normally would not have even at the gym for an hour.  Thanks Mark for a great book!!  I will be using it - probably forever and plan to send copies to my friends and family right now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very relaxing game and easy to get involved in. I like to play at night before trying to sleep and use solitaire to clear the day from my brain
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read all the reviews on this product and would like to address several of the negatives I read. The elastic is tight but I consider that a plus. Never have to worry about my kindle fire coming loose. The cover does not want to completey close at first but just store it upside down for a week or two and that problem goes away. It is a classy looking cover an everywhere I take it I get comments on how good looking it is. The classic antique book look is great and looks and feels like real leather. Can't beat this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King at his best. I loved the storytelling, the suspense and the love story. Great, great read! Any fan of King will love this story.
0439023491|5.0|The book came in amazing condition. No creases in pages, the paper cover over the hardcover was in perfect shape too. Not to mention the book was amazingggg. I couldn't put it down. Im not a big reader but this book was out of this world. I highly recommend it! only down side was the shipping was really really slow. took about 2 or 3 weeks to receive the item because amazon didn't keep it in stock
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game, very short and not all of them are very challenging. this. free game is. worth the storage space.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This app is extremely fun! its also a challenge,  if you like any Mario&reg; games, you'll like this one! its worth the $1!  :)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|like the story line. easy to play and fun to learn. will be looking for more from g5 entertainment soon.
B006ON41FC|5.0|you haters this game is SUPER fun......  it would be fun for kids four and fourth if you don't want open feint. DONT CLICK ON IT.  SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!  use your brain.  THINK!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|time consuming in a good way fun game great playability all togather yessssss....I will be playing this one for a while
B0067Q42BY|4.0|FUN AND SOOTHING. NOT REAL DIFFICULT . THIS MAHJONG WAS DIFFERENT. THAN THE ONES I HAVE PLAYED. BEFORE ...WHICH IS NICE
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great game. I am totally addicted to Mahjong Artifacts. I am so  glad that I am able to get it for my Kindle Fire!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great for all ages.There are a ton of games to play!Best of all it's free for all!
0553381407|2.0|How ugly it is that in the co-author photography above, he is disguised in devil. When in other books covering the same topic it is not uncommon to read about paranormal problems, and satanism (like in \\"The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment\\" by Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman or \\"MPD form inside out\\").  The book was very useful, but now I doubt. I have found other misleading books. It may be something broken in this book.
B002ZG983M|5.0|This one took me by surprise..I found it in the bargain bin at Wally World and figured what the hey, for seven bucks I can accept a crappy flick every now & again..  Instead I got humor up the wazoo, unbelievable action scenes that had me giggling like an idiot, and the unrelenting urge to press \\"play\\" again when the movie was done..  All in all, would have been worth paying the full retail price for, IMHO.  Two thumbs up from me.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's very fun, while still being a bit challenging.  I got it as a free app of the day, but if I knew how much fun it is, I definitely would of paid for it. I don't know offhand how much they are charging for it, but I'd say it's worth about $3 to $5, far as often as I play it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game, especially considering it is free!  no issues, seems to work just fine.  great for filling time while waiting at appointments, etc...
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I love this game! its super cheesey but that's what I love about this game! If you need a great game to pass the time, this is it!
B006UG90RM|5.0|The Mighty Van Halen has returned with the best rock 'n' roll album since Nirvanna came along and destroyed the genre and allowed Britney Spears, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Justin Beiber to control popular music!  They have really done it!  They created a modern day masterpiece!  Eddie plays his best guitar ever and reclaims his place as the greatest hard rock guitarist. He obviously knew he needed to redeem a lot of bad will, from allowing VH to become too keyboard heavy with too many love ballads, to the horrible misfire of hiring Gary Cherone to sing while forgetting what his tone should sound like on Van Halen III, to getting too drunk to remember how to play anymore, and seeing the embarrassing display plastered all over youtube during the 2004 tour. Eddie totally redeemed himself for all past sins!  Eddie also provides some of his best harmonies ever, and I was worried that his weathered speaking voice and cancer issues would affect that, especially when I first heard his monotone low octave harmony on Tattoo, but that is definitely not the case.  Dave is also in top form, writing some of the greatest lyrics and melodies I can recall in a very long time from anybody.  The guy was hungry to prove himself again just like Eddie was. I've seen people making comments that Dave has lost range, and it's like they are just repeating what some clueless critic who doesn't know how to sing had said. Dave never had great range back in the day, and he's actually stretching his limits now. He did that on Me Wise Magic, obviously realizing that Sammy Hagar had set a vocal standard, and he needed to at least stretch his range a bit to avoid criticisms. He continued stretch on the new CD, and if you listen to Outta Space and parts in You and Your Blues, he's hitting stuff in Sammy's range.  It's everything he can do to hit it, but he's hitting it, so please, no more of this silly talk about him losing range because you read some critic who can't sing say he has! He hasn't!  Wolfgang buries Michael Anthony on the bass, and forms a rhythm section pocket with Uncle Al that is a very big reason the new CD grooves so well!  I have to believe that their personal closeness has a lot to do with them getting so in step with eachother. He also kicks ass on the high harmonies.  I keep hearing people say that Michael Anthony's high harmonies are missed, as if they think the pitch on the high notes would be higher if Mike was singing.  Harmony doesn't work like that.  Wolfgang is hitting every note that Mike would have been singing.  Those notes don't change just because the singer does. I get the feeling that Wolf and Dave like eachother a lot, just from seeing them interact. Dave probably knows it's best to make friends with Eddie's boy. I also get the feeling that Wolf really got into Dave's lyrics and melodies by the way he throws himself into the vocals so passionately.  He and Dave sing great together, and when Eddie joins in, those Van Halen harmonies aren't begging for Mikey to return one bit.  Alex rocks the hell out of the drums, providing his nephew with a perfect partner to make everything sound as tight as I've ever heard music be. He does difficult advanced stuff, from the double kick beats to the speed changes. It's a bit surprising that with all the attention his brother's guitar playing gets, Al's very difficult and creative drumming never gets the same praise, despite everyone knowing how great he is.  Okay, since I have listened to this album about 50 times already, I'll do a quick song by song review:  Tattoo - When I first heard this, I was ashamed.  I waited 14 years for this turd?  After disappointments from bands like Kiss and the Eagles coming back after years to do mediocre cash grab lazy songs that didn't come close to their glory days, Tattoo seemed like more of the same. Then a funny thing happened!  That song started popping up in my head every day. It really grew on me because it's got a groove that stays with you, andit's catchy with some fun lyrics. When an album starts out with \\"I've got Elvis on my elbow\\",  I should have known the rest would be just as great! Eddie plays a mesmerizing rhythm guitar on this track that really sucks you into the groove.  She's the Woman - This was one of the old demo songs that VH used, and people really need to stop whining about that.  It's done all the time!  Even the Beatles went back and rerecorded One After 909 in 1969 after it appeared on their 1962 first demo.  She's The Woman is a great rocker, and it showcases exactly why Wolfgang easily replaces Michael Anthony on bass and vocals. Just listen to the new version compared to the old demo and hear for yourself.  All the reworked songs are improved upon!  You and Your Blues - This is a great song that I expect could be a single because it's got a great vocal harmony hook and melody that would work well on radio. Dave hits some Sammy Hagar range notes during the chorus, and Wolfgang and Eddie hit some super harmonies.  This is another song where Wolfgang shines on bass and vocals.  China Town - Eddie starts this off with a great intro, and then it's hold on for the ride of your life, as Eddie, Wolf and Al kick the tires and light the fires. It's fast and frantic music at it's energized best.  Dave's vocal phrasing is exceptional in this one, and the lyrics are stellar.  When Eddie takes off on the solo, it's the first song where he steps up and displays skills that we thought he lost or that he never had.  It's that good! Wolfgang's harmonies with Dave are incredible, as is his bass and Al's drumming. Perhaps the best track on the CD.  Blood and Fire - This is another great track where every member of the band shines. It almost feels like it's the band's anthem after all they've came through. The standout moment in the song is Dave saying \\"I told you I was coming back. Say you missed me.  Say it like you mean it.\\" and then Eddie answering him with a great guitar solo. The solo ends with anawesome nod to the Who, the way the power chords and drums play while the lead singer lets out a scream. Great stuff!  Bullethead - This is another rocker.  It's a fun song with a great harmony by Dave and Wolfgang as they sing the albums name \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\". This is the shortest song on the CD.  As Is - This starts with a funny count in by Al, and after a short drum and guitar chord intro, Eddie and Al take off with some of the most impressive speed riffing I've ever heard. Dave sings this one great, and when Wolfgang comes in on the harmonies, it's just perfect.  Eddie's solo in this is mindblowing.  Dave does a lot of talking throughout various places, and it's always awesome what he says, but nothing is better than when the song changes into this great shuffle beat guitar in the middle, and Dave talks out some awesome lyrics. Everyone comes back in to rock the song.  This song rocks so hard!  HoneyBabySweetieDoll - This has a bit of Ted Nugent mixed with a bit of a rap/hip hop delivery by Dave, and goes into some very interesting vocal harmonies. The most impressive thing about this one is how difficult it must have been to play because of all the stops and speed changes throughout. This is another song where Eddie delivers an absolutely mindblowing guitar solo. All 3 Van Halens shine musically on this one.  That's the Trouble With Never - This is another great rocker that starts off with a great lead guitar/bass riff hook. Dave sings this with a great sense of fun, and the line \\"when you turn on your stereo, does it return the favor?\\" is an awesome line. Great music, great harmonies, and another mindblowing solo from Eddie.  Wolfgang once again shows himself to be a much better bass player than Michael Anthony.  The kid is really THAT good.  Outta Space - This song is just balls to the walls ass kicking rock music! You would think that Dave's singing on this would shut people up about his \\"loss of vocal range\\", but it doesn't.  He's singing in Sammy's range here, folks. You can almost hear Robert Plant singing \\"Been a long time since I rock 'n' rolled\\"! Eddie delivers yet another mindblowing guitar solo.  Stay Frosty - This could be the star of the CD.  Stay Frosty could be released as a single, and it could become a national catch phrase if it is. It has the obvious connection to Ice Cream Man, but I can also hear Z Z Top's La Grange, Eric Clapton's Motherless Child, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band's Aberdene. Maybe a little Stray Cats thrown in there, too!  It's fun, swinging, and has catchy hooks and lyrics. Wolfgang and Uncle Al lay down a great boogie, and Eddie, once again, provides a mindblowing guitar solo. Stay Frosty!  Big River - This is another strong rocker, with great guitar, awesome bass, and some great harmonies by Dave and Wolfgang. Guess what Eddie does again?  Yep, another mindblowing guitar solo. He is on fire on this CD like never before!  Beats Working - The CD closes with another strong rocker with great harmonies.  After all the hard work that obviously went into this record,  it sounds like the fun and satisfaction they all got from knowing they just made a really special album that comes along so rarely made it all worthwhile and didn't make it feel like work. And it's got a cowbell!!  That's all for me.  Go out and buy this CD and support great rock music so we can bring it back where it belongs. A Different Kind of Truth is one of the best albums I've ever heard, and it rates right up there with Van Halen's first album.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|First off, this is the 3rd Matrix collection that I have owned. I purchased the original trilogy individually, then the Ultimate Colection on DVD and now this blu-ray release. I knew eventually that I would need to scale up to blu-ray, but was always worried that I would \\"lose\\" some of the special features.<br /><br />The Matrix movies are certainly one of my all time favorites (next to Star Wars and LOTR) so I didn't want to down grade by purchasing the blu-ray set. Let me start off by saying - this is not the case. I don't know that the promotional material has done a good enough job explaining what you get on this release, but there certainly are some differences.<br /><br />The DVD's were on 10 disks- but, the blu-ray set is on 6. You get 4 blu-rays (one for each movie) and then a set of 2 DVD's for the bonus features. The Zion Archive DVD is exactly the same as the one from the Ultimate DVD set - and then the \\"Burly Man\\" and \\"Roots\\" DVD's are mashed together on either side of a single disk.  But here is the break down for the rest of the disks and since I own all of them - let me show you exactly what you get comparing the original DVD release, to the Ultimate DVD release to the now Ultimate Blu-ray release:<br /><br />1.1 Matrix DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries the actor track and the music only commentary with Don Davis<br />* Making the Matrix<br />* Bullet time (as an Easter egg)<br /><br />1.2 Ultimate Matrix DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries \\"the philosopher\\" and the \\"critic\\"<br />* The music revisited<br />* Behind the matrix<br />* Take the red pill<br />* Follow the white rabbit.<br /><br />1.3 The Matrix blu-ray<br />* All 4 commentaries together. (great feature)<br />* Everything from the Ultimate DVD plus:<br />* The Music Revisited<br />* Rock is Dead Music Video<br />* Trailers and TV spots<br /><br />2.1 Reloaded DVD<br />* The Matrix unfolds<br />* Pre-load<br />* Get me an exit<br />* The MTV movie awards reloaded<br /><br />2.2 Ultimate Reloaded DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries \\"the philosopher\\" and the \\"critic\\"<br />* Car chase<br />* Teahouse fight<br />* Unplugged<br />* I'll handle them<br />* The exiles<br />* Enter the matrix the game<br />* All 23 live action shots from Enter the Matrix the game<br /><br />2.3 Ultimate Reloaded Blu-Ray<br />* Everything from both previous editions including:<br />* P.O.D. music video<br />* Theatrical and TV Trailers<br /><br />3.1 Revolutions DVD<br />* Revolutions recalibrated<br />* CG revolution<br />* Super Burly Brawl<br />* Future Gamer<br />* Before the Revolution<br />* 3-D evolution<br />* Operator<br /><br />3.2 Ultimate Revolutions DVD<br />* Crew<br />* Hell<br />* Super burly brawl<br />* New blue world<br />* Siege<br />* After math<br /><br />3.3 Ultimate revolutions Blu-Ray<br />* Everything from both previous editions including:<br />* Neo realism - the evolution of bullet time<br />* Super big mini models<br />* Double agent smith<br />* Mind over matter<br /><br />In addition, each Blu-Ray features an in-Movie experience. The IME is included on all 3 of the Matrix films. The IME is an exclusive interactive feature that allows viewers to enjoy new ways of accessing interviews and other material while the movie is running. For these titles, the IME will let viewers experience via picture in picture the evolution of all The Matrix's ground breaking elements through the recollections of the cast and creative team.<br /><br />So you are not losing anything with this set.<br /><br />The negatives: first the thing that bummed me out the most... no fun menus. Each menu is a static matrix code screen shot (that doesn't even move) it looks like the wallpaper that you had on your desktop back in high school. You'd think on a blu-ray disk, you'd get something fun and awesome, but it's boring, there are not even little transition videos like the other releases had. Oh well.<br /><br />Second, I play my movies on a Playstation 3 and all of my Blu-rays show up with the title, an icon and perhaps even music from the movie. These discs all show up as an unknown file. Not even a title - you can't tell which disk is in the player from the PS3 menu. Kinda lame.<br /><br />Other than that - these movies have never looked or sounded better. Amazing transfer! I watched these on my new HD-TV with my surround sound up and I felt like I was back in the theatre. Definitely pick these up!t like I was back in the theatre. Definitely pick these up!
B0000027FQ|4.0|Just broke this out after a couple years and it still blows away almost any live metal performance of recent years.  Precision German musicianship and Japanese sound engineering came together on that night in Osaka Japan almost 30 years ago and the result was pure sonic bliss!  This was YEARS before the digital age and the sound is phenomenal.
B004478GN8|5.0|If you're wondering why this kit comes with 4 Jango Fetts and two crafts that you have never seen in the Star Wars films it's because this set is taken from the cartoon TV series. The episode was called \\"A friend in need\\" and it would explain that these characters are members of the \\"Death Watch.\\" These are Ex-Mandalorians who split with Jaster Mereel. The two craft are also modeled after ships that the Death Watch rode in the episode.<br /><br />Of course, my son calls them all \\"Jango\\" and that's fine. The craft are super easy to build. This is a great set, lots of playability and of course... there are a lot of guns!
B000000Y26|4.0|Of the Wes Montgomery albums, this is my favorite. Really his most inspired work. The quality of this vinyl is great as well.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|its all in how the tiles are layer out. I wish the music was different..but to each his own..app games are just a time waster.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is great. It opens and works great on the Kindle Fire. I would have bought it if it wasn't the free app of the day. Thank You App Store!!
B003RV43X4|5.0|this movie got a lot of bad buzz, and mixed reviews. I thought it was fantastic, a great bigger better and more fun than the original which I loved as a kid, I must have watched our tape till it wore out.  I think a lot of the bad reviews were related to the last minute cash-in 3d conversion that was made, but as a rental on Amazon - 5 stars.  my only complaint is the guy who plays Perseus is more of an action hero - not a great actor. he is completely a block of wood through the whole movie which is a shame because everyone else was great although his fight scenes were intense and well done (probably the main reason they hired him)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've tried quite a few of the free rule games with no luck, but this one is awesome. Thanks Amazon!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app has a lot of fun games but some times it takes a second to register the moves. especially when playing the snake game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm enjoying the multiple layouts, backgrounds, and tilesets. I also like the story.  I haven't tried the endless version yet. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this game.  Hard and extremely frustrating but the faces on the groceries are hilarious.  Just one question; Why is the milk so mad???
6305128952|5.0|Having been a horse lover all my life, a Robert Redford fan, and a lover of the beautiful breathtaking scenery of the west, this movie contained all the elements plus a wonderful heart warming story with many levels of emotion.  I tried to find the movie several places and was so pleased to be able to purchase it at Amazon.
B001NLKT60|3.0|The first 150 pages of The Girl Who Played with Fire could have and should have been condensed to about 15 pages.  The reader does not care about how Lisbeth Salander furnished her new apartment with selections from her local IKEA.  But, for the remainder of the book, the plot was well developed.<br /><br />In the first book of the trilogy, Lisbeth Salander survives and thrives because she is committed to her goals and because she is clever and resourceful.  In this book, she is transformed into something of a female Rambo, which is only partially explained.<br />To say that Ms. Salander is a fighter by nature is an understatement.  But having a fighting nature and being clever and resourceful does not explain how a heavy smoker who is as small as she is has the endurance and the strength to elude and overpower adversaries like she does in this novel.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love it.  The tiles are easy to see and the backgrounds are beautiful.  I also think the quest story line is fun.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just started the 30 day shred and I am on day 5 and I am already seeing results. I have a lot more energy , and feel very happy because I am finally comitted to a work out .

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love playing this awsome game. Thanks! The graphics and gameplay are awsome... works great on my Atrix 4G. I love mahjong
B000001FDK|5.0|Cool comes with lots of songs like 23 and it has all the songs from the movie. And arrived on time(:
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Like the floors and the story.  Works great on my Fire.  Ads don't bother me because I ignore them and just enjoy the free game.  **UPDATE** After the initial ad telling you about their other games there are no more ads.  This is a great game, I have been playing it all day!!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is honestly the most incredible book I have ever read - and I read a lot.  I originally bought it because it's a longer book and I wanted something that would take me longer than a day or so.  But I was incredibly wrong - I picked up my Kindle to read the book and didn't put it down until I finished.  \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is the perfect kind of romance - the characters aren't mad out to be perfect.  Abby and Travis both have their flaws and their relationship is horrible sometimes, but it's real life.  I have very little complaints with the book - they're so menial they aren't even worth mentioning. I love how each character brings a different aspect to the story line.  I fell in love with the relationships in the book.  All the characters make mistakes and McGuire doesn't glamorize the bad in the relationships.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is a great show. The first episode was a little like \\"what the hell am I watching\\" but it had enough to keep me wanting to see the second episode. I was hooked! Great characters, great stories, awesome special effects. This show makes buffy look like a joke. Why one season? I don't get that.
0060873027|1.0|This is Crichton's book in name only. He may have even written the outline for the book. But this is in no way up to par for a Crichton novel.<br /><br />Preston gave too much away in places. What should have been a huge reveal was lukewarm as best, since Preston had shown his hand mere chapters (very short chapters at that) before.<br /><br />What little character and scene development was there read like it was lifted from Crichton's original notes. Preston made no effort to delve into background details, which made the detailed sections stick out all the more. At least two characters existed only to further the plot with dialogue where Preston could not sculpt or weave a meaningful plot. Actually, there was far too much dialogue and not enough paragraphs.<br /><br />The tale is predictable and fairly boring. The verbiage meanders and reuses words and phrases in close contact with each other; a habit I can't recall ever reading in a Crichton work. I also can't recall ever skipping over even the gory passages in JP, or Next, or Prey, but I merely glanced at some of the later chapters in Micro. *yawn*<br /><br />There are other authors (Alton Gansky, Andrew Klavan, and especially Robert Liparulo) whose own writing style mimics Crichton's far better than Preston. Micro is a watered-down Crichton at best, a horrendous mockery at worst.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have never read a Preston novel, and only chose to read Micro because of Crichton's name. I am so glad I got it from the library and did not waste any money on it.<br /><br />If you are looking to read this just for a bug's eye view, the movies Antz, A Bug's Life, or Honey I Shrunk the Kids are a better bet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great for picking out verses. easy reading. good notation. use it every day. like the format - like randomly picking verses.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game. Nice music. Smooth game play.  Any Mahjong fan would be happy with this game. I don't have ads on my game. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A very nice and polished Mahjong Solitaire game. Great variety and worth a try for anyone. It is a very well done application without a doubt.
B005FITIIC|5.0|This movie totally surprised me at many levels. First there was the acting. They all did a good job but Jereme Irons was \\"incredible\\". His part reminds me of the power displayed by Cristopher Walker in his \\"sinister\\" role as the counselor for a Don in the movie True Romance. Irons played the role of a CEO of an investment firm and you could feel the power of the character he played. His scenes were show stopping. His acting is worthy of an academy award. Paul Bettany also did an excellent job in his character as an investment floor supervisor. It was a change up for him in roles and it showed why he is such a good and powerful actor.  The script was the next pleasant surprise. I was expecting a movie that was going to bash the Wall Street People but instead it was a thoughtfully well scripted movie showing the ordinary lives of people who got caught up in the meltdown. There was no right or wrong or Democrat/Republican \\"stuff\\". Just a story of how part of the meltdown happened, how some investment people dealt with it and how it affected parts of their personal lives. In essence this was \\"A day in the life of\\" type of movie that was incredibly well acted by a heavy weight cast (and there were lots of them).  The movie will probably not do very well commercially because it is too cerebral but if you like your brain to be worked out then check this movie out.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is so much fun. it is addicting!!! some lag but still really cool.  I though wish there were more stuffin it though.
B005OK725M|5.0|I love movies where the heroes are a-- kicking heroines. I loved Sigourney Weaver's role in \\"Alien\\" (and all of the alien movies actually), Angelina Jolie's role in \\"Salt' and Sanna Lathan's role in \\"Aliens vs. Predator\\". This is another one of those movies and I love Zoe Saldana's role in this movie. I basically fell in love with her screen personality with the remake of Star Trek and have tried to catch alot of her movies such as Losers, Avatar and Takers.  This movie has all of the things that I like for your basic gratuitous sex and violence movie. It is hard hitting with real nasty villians, unrequited love, death, and some great revenge scenes. It is like your basic opera plot but with a few differences.  If you just want to relax and blow a little steam off this is a great movie. Also check out the \\"Making of\\" parts in special features on the DVD. They are interesting.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is great! The locations alone just added \\"I want more\\",to the films! It all made sense because of the world situation today. It is a subjuect that is beleiveable. The action,the plot,all make it one of the most enjoyable series of dvd's I have had the pleasure of watching in a long time! Buy it! You cannot go wrong!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|one of the best apps of the day.. well worth the free download ... highly recommend you will love this game
1452101248|5.0|From its looks to the content, I love this book. The recipes are wonderful, and just up my alley. I will eventually get to every single one of them. So far, the ones I have tried were all successful, tasty and great looking.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Totally fun and easy to understand. Great graphics and cool backgrounds. Addition of a story line keeps interest up cause you wanna see what happens next.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very enjoyable.  Excellent tutorial for folks new to Mahjong or for folks like me who have forgotten how to play and need a refresher.
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is addicting and I cant imagine not playing it 4 a day! I love this game. I got all the outfits (Which took about all day) and am now an almond.   smiles,   smilekate or Kate
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is amazing. I love it! so fun. its not too tricky but not too easy. very fun to be a flying squirrel

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a vary fun game but is really hard to get points on and the graphics are bad but its still fun
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game has a story line and missions to reach so it makes Mahjong even more of a game.  I'm enjoying it.

0307593312|3.0|I've been a fan of this author for a while so I was excited when this came out and I could read it. The story itself was not bad, however, reading through the book became a big chore. It seemed to repeat itself many times over and I found myself skipping over full pages about halfway through because different characters kept repeating the same stories, describing the same things, saying the same things. It felt like it was just trying to make the book longer for some reason. After a while it became a bit aggravating that it took so many chapters for one small thing to happen. I almost wanted to skip to the part at the end when Tengo and Aomame finally meet because all the chapters in between just dragged on and on and there was only so many times I wanted to read about her sitting in her apartment alone.<br /><br />I think this book could have been much shorter and more enjoyable but it was dragged out way too much. It repeated itself too much (like how I keep repeating how it repeated itself.) Too many things never ended up explained in the end and it annoyed me to an extent. What ever happened to Tsubasa? Who was the NHK guy that kept showing up at Aomame's apartment? What about Fuka-Eri? Especially her story, it ended suddenly and that was it. She just left and that was it. This was not the best thing he's ever written. It had potential but it just didn't impress me as much as his other books. Usually I felt bummed out finishing his books, but this one I was just glad to get it over with. Giving it 3 stars because it was a good story but not well executed. Shorten it and take out the repetitive parts and it'd be so much better.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|Faster has some great moments and a very decent premise. Unfortunately it's also fairly poorly executed in places. It's also very predictable and cliched and some of the acting is pretty wooden with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton (although he has a terrible haircut in this film). The basics of the plot are that Dwayne Johnson's character is out for revenge and it's established very early on that he's very determined. There is however a kind of pointless subplot about a hitman who is on Dwayne's tail. All of the scenes featuring the hitman and his girlfriend serve only to pad out the film and slow down the pace. The twist at the end can be seen a mile off, but if you're looking for a no brainer action movie then this isn't too bad a way to spend 90 minutes of your time.
B004L49K20|5.0|If Duran Duran had come out with this album after Rio, they wouldn't have drifted into obscurity. The production is great and the music is hoppin'. Really harkens back to Duran Duran and Rio. Love it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I don't know what everyone is talking about.... I haven't seen one ad, nor did I have to go through a long walk through process before game play.... this is a great game. Kindle Fire User.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|not bad at all. good for wasting time and also has some challenging puzzles that can kkleep you trying for awhile.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good game.  Kind of big.  One of the better app of the day.  Not sure i would pay five dollars
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album........ROCKS!  I wouldn't have thought they would be able to pull off an album that sounds like it could have been stuck in between Van Halen II and Women and Children but man oh man, is this album it.  Dave's voice shouldn't sound as good as it does at his age.  Eddie proves he is the guitarist that Hendrix is probably listening to up in heaven.  Alex proves he can still make a 40 year old bang his head against his car steering wheel and even though all of us true VH fans miss Mike and his JB bass, Wolfie's work not only keeps the band solid but he's keeping them young.  The energy coming off this album is crazy.  I won't go into a long description of each track since others have done a great job but just let me tell you that if you are on the fence about buying this album, TAKE THE PLUNGE!  If you're a true fan, you won't regret it.  One final word, get the delux album with the bonus DVD.  The live acoustic jam sessions are supercool to watch.  It's just a little extra treat that all of us true fans have deserved for so many years of putting up with thier antics.  VH ROCKS!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is very addictive. probably the best free app of the day I have seen this month. no issues with crashing or freezing on my Motorola RAZR.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|First I need to express that I do love this trilogy regardless of what I am about to write. I think the author is an exceptionally talented writer and I am only making a complaint out of personal frustration with the end. I still have not been discouraged to tell people to read this trilogy. I feel every character has their own identity and Suzanne Collins shows that she offers a lot of talent and brilliance to her readers. I know that many people will not agree with what I am about to write but I feel the need to express my feelings.<br /><br />Now to the subject of my review...<br />Why I am annoyed with Peeta's character!<br /><br />...SPOILER REVIEW...<br /><br />I became annoyed with Peeta when he openly admitted to all of Panem, during national live television, that he's always had feelings for Katniss. Peeta's declaration for love was a form of entrapment.<br /><br />Peeta delivers his news during a live national broadcast which in turn leaves Katniss exposed and vulnerable to his secret. Katniss never actual has time to consider her non-existent feelings towards the estrange Peeta. This news engulfs Katniss into a whirlwind of scandal. This is the foundation of my frustration. The rumors and allegations are all for the sake of more sponsors and a hopeful advantage that one will return from the Hunger Games.<br /><br />What about Gale?<br /><br />Granted Katniss is not at all Gales property but Peeta rightfully knows Katniss and Gale obviously have more than just a friendship. Katniss deserves a chance to confront her feelings for Gale prior to being pinned down by Peeta's devotion to protect her.<br /><br />When Peeta voices his feelings for Katniss he automatically puts her in a situation FORCING her to play this \\"star cross lovers\\" ROLE.... \\"real or not real?\\"<br /><br />Peeta doesn't even consult Katniss regarding whether this makes her uncomfortable, which it obviously does at the time, and brings me to the question of... \\"turn on or turn off?\\"<br /><br/>....In my opinion this is a big turn off.<br /><br />I feel like this makes a big impact on Katniss because now she has to appease what the people of Capitol want. Instead of being able to distinguish her true feelings she is forced into having unknown feelings and mixed emotions. The effects of his announcement leaves Katniss preprogramed to have feelings for Peeta. Is this for the sake of the game? In my opinion Katniss is hijacked long before President Snow ever hijacks Peeta.<br /><br />Eventually her feelings become more solid as the story develops but the whole storyline of there love makes me feel uncomfortable. Peeta, Haymitch, Capital, President Snow, and many others force a relationship and build on feelings that Katniss never truly had before. It starts off as an act and a tactic for survival and develops into something much more.<br /><br />The games make Katniss and Peeta's bond grow stronger and during these certain circumstances Katniss and her love for Peeta start to unfold develop and change. Leaving Gale without a fighting chance to prove his true feelings for Katniss.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is what causes Gale an unfair disadvantage. Katniss and her forced relationship, has taken away from Gale getting to show what he is truly capable of offering her. Gale will not be able to prove the lengths he can go for her. Katniss is barely even thankful that Gale will be willing to do anything to provide for her family, even if she is never to return.<br /><br />Finally Gale is given his chance, while Peeta is held captive by Capitol, but Gale doesn't hold a candle to Peeta. Peeta's safety is all that Katniss can think of.<br /><br />*When Peeta finally returns I had this extreme happy feeling when Katniss almost has to shoot Peeta dead- while having to try to escape the underground. To be honest, all of Mockingjay I had found myself hoping Peeta can not recover.<br /><br />I do not feel satisfied with Katniss and Peeta's bond. It is because the ending came so abruptly and I was not given a sense of attachment for Peeta after reading the first two books. I had the feeling that Katniss and Peeta's relationship was never as emotioinally developed it was not as natural as She and Gales. Katniss and Peeta's love always reminded me of an arranged marriage, something that was forced on by current events and other people. The influence of tragedy they endure is what molds the road ahead. I never truly connect with this bond though. Katniss and Peeta go through a shared personal experience from the twisted games. Capitol leaves scars that will never truly heal because of its brutality. This still did not give me enough reason for Katniss to have a change of heart towards Gale.<br /><br />Although Katniss and Gale share a devastating history of events, its as though Katniss loses all her past important moments with Gale. In this last book, Katniss completely pushes Gale out of her mind, basically making their past becomes a lost memory. Both Gale and Katniss fathers die in a mining accident. This devistating event forces Katniss and Gale to become their family providers at such a young age. They find each other because they start to hunt for game, this leads them to become hunting partners. After years, because of their closeness they develop a strong friendship and a possible blossoming romance. Katniss and Gales previous experiances is what has help to mold and make the relationship grow. Setting up a feeling of comfort for the reader. Their situations have force them to become stronger individuals. This bond is some how forgotten after the return from the hunger games and the relationship is forced to severly suffer.<br /><br />I don't feel like the relationship between Katniss and Gale should have drifted apart the way that it has. In the first and the second book Katniss always thinks of Gale while away at the games. As the trilogy comes to an end the author gears Gales personality to really get involved with throwing over Capitol. It is as though his life goals change more than half way through the third book and the perception of who he is dramatically changes to the reader with in the last quater of the book.<br /><br />The reason I became so attached to Katniss and Gales relationship is because she always worries for his feelings and doesn't want to disappoint him. Gale is always a thought in the back of her mind. She has an apparent love for Gale. The bond from growing up in the Seams and having to be the livelihood for their family. This gave me as the reader a sense of common ground. Even though ultimately Katniss decides to be with Peeta. Gale has to give up because he realizes Katniss lost her desire of affection towards him.<br /><br />The ending of the book happens so fast that I felt left off in anger and frustration. I felt heart broken for Gale. He is forced to give up his bestfriend, his love, and now must feel forever guilty that he most likely was the reason for Prims death. This was the hardest part reading the end of the trilogy for me. Not only does she choose Peeta over Gale, Gale is the person that causes Prim's death. It was entirely too unreal for me. Gale made for an outstanding protector of the Everdeens. The ending was like a carpet being ripped from underneath me.<br /><br />Not for nothing, I felt a whole lot of empathy towards one character. Their was never any clarity of what had become of Gale. Not only this but Gales character was left with an unresolved and heartbreaking goodbye. I feel I would have much rather read Katniss ended up alone if not with Gale.
B006G2NVCA|4.0|Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. What can I say. Their music is cutting edge, modern and it absorbs you. This album is a little beyond what I have heard form these two in the past and the three disc set goes on and on but you don't get tired of listening. The story of the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo is bold and edgy, and, so is this music.
1451627289|2.0|This book started off so promising. I ended up finishing it pretty quickly because I wanted to find out what happens in the end and I was so disappointed. It was a bit of a chore when it got to many parts and I speed read through them. I hated the ending and I really dislike the main characters because they were so corny and unbelievable. Maybe people in the 60s were really corny, I don't know and I don't think so. This is my first Stephen King book; judging from the reviews and since he is heavily marketed as one of America's best writers, I was convinced that this must be an awesome book and it wasn't. I was suckered in to buy this book by the first few chapter preview on Amazon and the 97% 5-star reviews and now I regret it. I don't understand how he can create a pretty interesting character and then proceed to make them so boring, maybe it has to do with writing a 800 page book. I skipped a lot of Jake and Sadie's conversations. The most interesting parts was when Jake was trying to help minor characters (Harry Dunning and the little girl). What a waste of an interesting story and plot.<br /><br />Anyways, I feel like this entire book was inspired by a Mad Men episode that featured Kennedy's death and an episode of American Dad where Stan went back in time to stop Reagan from getting shot and came back to a distopian America. I'm sure its not, because in the afterword King said he's been working on it in since the 70s or something. The worst part of it is that I finished the book feeling like I've wasted my time reading it and regret spending $20 dollars on it. I've already forgotten most of the book, and I've just finished it last night.<br /><br />Maybe I would've liked this book more if I'm a Stephen King fan or something but I'm really put off by this author now.
B003ITDN86|1.0|sorry but the clips on the cd sound too much like my chemical romance, i think i am gonna pass on this one. it sounds like his voice is giving out. too bad, i liked sum 41. they had crisp guitars and powerful vocals, this just sounds soggy and not like sum 41.
B006ON41FC|4.0|fun and easy to play, great on the kindle fire.  I was unable to stop.  graphics were cute.  would recommend as a great time.
B002C1BHIO|1.0|Bought this cable in January 2011, plugged it in, and it worked flawlessly for a year almost to the day.  It was connecting my Panasonic TV to my Panasonic Home Theater system, which among other things, provides a \\"Viera Link\\" between the two components, allowing for unified control of such things as volume and source input.  Then all of the sudden, I turned on my TV the other day, and realized the the link /control had been lost, and I received a message on the TV, \\"check your HDMI connection\\".  I re-seated the HDMI cable on both ends, and re-booted both components.  The connection was temporarily re-established, but was lost again later in the day.  I replaced the HDMI cable between the two components, and everything now works fine,  then I took the faulty cable and tested it between two other components in another room, and sure enough, it confirmed that the cable was faulty.  This happened just over one year after the original purchase, and Amazon warrenty expired, and the cable is not returnable.  What's interesting to me about this is that this is supposed to be one of Amazon's most high quality private label cables.  I have other Amazon-branded HDMI cables, but they are of the lower, non-braided, quality.  I haven't had any problems with those cables (yet).  But perhaps this is an argument that the amount one spends on HDMI cable is not predictive of how well the cable will perform.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Movie filled with values and ethics our society needs to return to and focus on.  Hollywood would do well to return to producing more movies that benefit society rather than corrupting our moral values. It is a movie that focuses on the role men need to take as husbands and fathers.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoyed the free version but am enjoying the variety more.  The varied tiles are colorful and easy to read. Not too &quot;busy&quot;.  I also like the auto zoom feature.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|really a fun game, and for free, you cant beat that with a stick! I'm not a huge mahjong player, but as far as these games go this is one of the most polished ive played. I like the quest mode too. id recommend to buy only if your looking for a slick mahjong game with different game modes. all in all a good game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|All I can say is Wow!!! The acting in this movie is far better than the previous Sherwood movies, in my opinion . I hope and pray there will be a Courageios II!!!
B006VREOOY|3.0|I don't think this is a great flick, but it is ok for an action flick, and well worth the $2 standard definition rental. So I wouldn't pay much but $2 is worth it.
B001SN78JO|5.0|I took forever to watch this film and had no idea it was so good. The storyline is about not making excuses and saying yes to everything. This seriously changes the protagonist's life for the better. Man on the Moon is my favourite Jim Carrey film and Yes Man might just be the second best. I think I'm going to definitely buy the blu ray.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its a good version, does what solitaire should do. is easy to use. I don't really like that there is an option to make sure you have a winning game, but I just don't use it.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I am not a Johnny Depp fan and I find his performance in most films the same as the other films. But in THE RUM DIARY, I really enjoyed his character. You see a man looking for a job lands up in Puerto Rico and he gets the job of a reporter at a controversial newspaper. He is the only person applying so he is selected but he has a drinking problem. There are several funny scenes in the film and the characters grow on you. Phoebe's Pyromaniac brother is back too and plays the role of an even more drunk fella. The scenery is beautiful, some of the action is fun to watch and overall this film does exactly what it set out to do. Not change the world but just amuse the viewer. Definitely a Winner in my book.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Addicting and fun. It can get boring at times, but fun when you have nothing to do. Going Nuts can be fun!
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|This movie rocked.  Pure fun vampire movie.  Nothing I found offensive in it ... might not be good for small children.  That being said I would totally let my children watch this.  Nothing but 5 stars is appropriate.  The main vampire guy did an awesome job at acting.  I know that isn't his normal role but it should be.  Freaking great movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i luv this game so much. addicted.awesome cute game where u move the squirrel left or right to get the nuts ( not bad ones) and avoid the trees :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Who would have ever guessed a game about trying to fit groceries into a bag could be this fun? This app is packed with many hours of fun levels. I have been playing it off and on for over a week now and haven't come close to finishing the game. Goals are to pack groceries into a bag, break them, arrange them and such. Just as the different birds in Angry Birds do different things, so do the grocery characters in this app. Loads of fun and definitely an app worth paying for!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very fun and easy I like to play this game when I'm in the car with my mom very fun to pass time
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very fun and addictive! achievements make it more fun as well. May not run very well on older devices though.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is a cute fun game. could use better game progression, and maybe integrating some levels would make it more engaging. overall entertaining and it was free! works well on galaxy nexus and HTC thunderbolt.
B003BWERF8|5.0|This little device works wonderfully with my Nano gen6. See my review of the Jabra Clipper, as I recommend using the Clipper with this device and a similar Nano for lightweight, easy, wireless music.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is a great box set to get. The sound is amazing with these movies. On a 7.1 system with big subs it is great.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app has been amazing! It has had some short comings in the past but it'sup to snuff now.The only problem I have now is when I initially connect to my iMac it displays incorrectly the first time around. I have to exit out and retry again to get it to display correctly. As it stands, it's impossible to play games like Minecraft. Please make that possible. Other than that we now have things like drag and drop and right click. So in summary this app is robust but needs just a little more to be perfect. I recommend it but it could be just a little bit better to be perfect. To make it more of an actual client it could use some intuitiveness to actually replicate being on the computer itslelf. Overall I'm happy but I'm waiting for that additional piece to make it perfect. Still pretty happy.
B003Y5H556|3.0|This was ok. Not really what I expected? If I had seen it before I would not have paid for it.

0446563048|4.0|Needing a break from the seriously seriousness of war books, I picked up Tony's Hsieh's \\"autobiography-ish\\" book named \\"Delivering Happiness.\\" At once a brief memoir of this young man's life, an explanation of his life's philosophy, and the origin of Zappos, this book is written in an accessible and conversational style (for which he apologizes to his high school English teachers in the preface) which makes it a very fast read. Hitting a soft spot and resonating for me, he opens the book with a Morpheus quote: \\"There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.\\"<br /><br />Other than my not being an entrepreneurial millionaire, Tony Hsieh's maturation arc matches very closely with mine and I identify with his overall life and professional philosophy. He prescribes the reader through analogy throughout the book to learn from mistakes and to learn from successes.  A particularly wise piece of advice in the book is to engage each person genuinely, whether they are a janitor or a venture capitalist, on a personal level because you never know what you might learn from them or the connections that might arise from the conversation. It is a very human approach to relationships.<br /><br />The book is filled with internal Zappos emails which shows you the relative transparency and intimacy that Tony brings to his management philosophy.  His view of work / life balance feels so familiar yet Utopian to me - he mixes his professional and personal relationships with a truly holistic approach to life... at one point he turns his own personal loft (Club BIO, great story) into office space to keep Zappos afloat.<br /><br />The book is full of lists, betraying Tony's organizational nature - what techie doesn't love lists? But the highlight of the book for me (being philosophically inclined) is the ending. After Zappos has landed on its figurative feet through rounds of capital raising and near collapses, Tony ends the book on a philosophical note. He recounts an idea known as \\"Happiness as a Fractal.\\"  The nerd attraction of fractals pulls me in, but the depth of this analogy is not lost on me.  Tony writes, \\"I think the parallels between what the research has found makes people happy (pleasure, passion, purpose) and what the research has found makes for great long-term companies (profits, passion, purpose) makes for one of the most interesting fractals I've ever come across.\\"<br /><br />This book will be interesting to those that are fans of Zappos or to those that want a glimpse into how Internet innovators and future primitive Silicon Valley entrepreneurs view the world.  Pardon the pun, but it is a happy, fun, and fast read.ractal.\\"  The nerd attraction of fractals pulls me in, but the depth of this analogy is not lost on me.

0756405890|4.0|I usually prefer more uplifting books, but something about the world created in this book made it difficult to put down. This is a good read, but ultimately I'll only feel justified in reading the first two books if the series does not get dragged out too much - I'm ready for a conclusion!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Now I'm part of the club and I understand why everyone has been raving about The Millennium Series.  So gush, gush, gush, I loved everything about it.  I was sucked in from page one, I adored all of the characters, and the intrigue kept me turning the pages rapidly.  I won't expound on the plot, but I felt so involved in everything that happened, from Lisbeth's research to Blomkvist's investigation into the Vanger family.  Every detail narrated was essential to connect the various threads of the plot.  I am definitely thrilled that I finally jumped on the bandwagon and am very excited to read the next book.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|I guess this is what you call a high concept novel...maybe that's why I didn't 'get it'..maybe it's too high concept for a knucklehead like me...or maybe it just wasn't really my cup of tea...<br /><br />Now I don't want to make this sound as if I'm bashing Gaiman's ability as an author.  He's a very GOOD author.  The prose, the settings...I can't imagine the amount of research and time it took for him to put this epic piece of literature together.  It's just that, in the end, it's not a story that I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />The overall concept was very intriguing.  'Gods' are a manifestation of popular belief and worship.  Enough people believed that a 'god' caused the thunder and then there was Thor..well, you get the idea.  However, with no one to believe in them they start to become powerless and forgotten.  It reads like a commentary on America, modern America as a whole.  The old gods are struggling for survival in the wake and surge of the new gods.  Gods of information, digital gods, social media gods.  A war is coming, old vs. new.<br /><br />Enter Shadow.  A man serving a three year jail sentence who will be used as a vessel of the old gods, an errand boy actually, although he's more important than the reader is lead to believe.  After being released from jail early (and I won't spoil why) he runs into a very powerful old god and his adventure begins.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad, or should I say, not to my liking.  At the beginning of the book I though I was going to love this story.  There were times, especially about half way through and about 90% through, that I actually enjoyed the story as well.  It's the in between parts that had me furrowing my brow thinking 'WHAT am I reading??'.  You see, it's very rambling.  Just when a kernel of an interesting story thread would be cropping up it would ramble off into uncharted territory: old gods, weird descriptions of rituals and god like powers, strange stories from the past.  These come up time and time again throughout the story.  And all the while Shadow, still dealing with some personal things (which I actually thought were some of the best reading in the whole novel) just shrugs and goes along with the flow, never questioning..not until much later anyway.  Not to sound too derogatory I felt as if I was in the mind of someone on a bad acid trip.  I very nearly skipped over entire passages and nearly entire sections of chapters just to get through it. Normally a book this size I can kill in a day, day and a half.  This took me over four days to read.<br /><br />I know this is 'revered' and 'critically acclaimed' but in the end it just wasn't for me.  I credit Gaiman for being bold enough to come up with something very new and different and what's more, he actually went on a journey while writing it that follows the progression of the story (as detailed by Mr. Gaiman in the forward).  In the end, it just wasn't my cup of tea sorry to say.

0321784421|3.0|I found the book hard to read. At first I thought it was me, but I have decided the book is not well written. Unless you read it cover to cover there are many places where terms are used without explanation. Maybe it is because there are 2 authors but I find the chapters are disconnected. The book seems to have much good information but needs a good editor.

B004RPKUTU|4.0|In \\"Coraline,\\" a little girl walks into a parallel world where her other mother cooks better than her real mother and desires for Coraline to leave her world behind. However, Coraline has to agree to have buttons sewn on her to replace her eyes.  Coming off reading something heavy (or profound, for \\"heavy\\" may connote something bad to some people; still, I prefer the simpler word \\"heavy\\"), I was thrown into some sort of genre shock transitioning to \\"Coraline.\\" I felt like, perhaps, I'm the wrong age group for this. Some works are not able to transcend age boundaries and the beginning of this story made me think that this is one of those works.  The question then arose: When reading, do you use a different set of standards for different kinds of written works? Or should there be standards at all?  As the story went along, however, I began to change my mind. I am the right age group for this. If not for the fact that I am truly a child at heart, I am also aunt to three children who can be a handful, demanding attention in the midst of seemingly adult concerns. They are the same lovely creations that I had to turn my back on because there are responsibilities I deemed more pressing.  The story is an easy and enjoyable read. We encounter a touch of the fantastic in the possibility that a more perfect version of us adults can be better at loving our children than we simply because they pay attention and we, we sometimes take for granted.  So, perhaps, I applied an even higher set of standards to books primarily intended for children because, if they were to transcend age boundaries, that is a broad spectrum of interests we're talking about right there. Besides, don't children hold all adults to a stricter (albeit more fun) standard anyway?  I'm glad to inform, however, that \\"Coraline\\" passed with flying colors.  P.S. And how cool is it that Coraline is preternaturally articulate? Like, you know, beyond coolness!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|you get a lot for the price but fortunately for me I got it for free today. there's a story mode classic and arcade. in the story mode the tiles change depending on the country so u start off with the regular mahjong tiles but then go to Greece and the tiles have Greek symbols on them.
1400079144|3.0|\\"History, if it has taught us anything at all, has taught us that the strange ideas we deride today will one day be our celebrated truths.\\"  I thought it should have ended many pages before its actual end but there was probably a need to use up all the facts culled from the research. This is what makes any Dan Brown novel truly fascinating. It's a mix of what you already know to be true and what you may have frowned at. The facts he inputs to make the reader either believe or suspend his disbelief are astonishing. At some point, you're just about ready to throw the book away because of concepts that are put forth as real but would require a massive amount of faith to internalize. Then again, not opening your mind up to new age concepts would get you slapped with the part I quoted above. And Brown would be right, of course.  To me, the charm of Dan Brown's novels isn't in the plot and the writing style, which one could merrily pick at and chew. It's in the fact that they make you think -- think about your own beliefs or the way you see the world. I liked The Lost Symbol because I believe in the premise already -- that thought can change the world. I'm not sure how I feel about the details or Freemasonry, which figures so prominently in this one. (Wonder what Freemasons think about this novel.) But I sure wish this detail is true: that people have a real and quantifiable, not figurative or vague, soul.  My quarrel with the end is its simplicity and the fact that it felt like a discussion of religion. But it could also be a non-religious discussion of some concept that religion claims to own. I have long dissociated from any religion and am allergic to any lengthy discussion that involves it. But again, I claim to be open-minded and that's what I'm going to be.
B0063IH60K|4.0|is fun to play I enjoy the random deals and the easy game play its nice to relax and play

B005I6EU7U|5.0|This Kindle Fire cover is high quality, great looking, and the idea cover accent to my new Kindle.  Love it in every way and highly recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|like this game better than the other mahjong game I have. the story line is great for keeping you entertained. will pass the time.
1423101499|5.0|This book is great and doesn't disappoint.  The entire series is worth reading and this part of the story is no different.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is totally worth it, gives you a variety of ways to play it. definately recommend this game. great job
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's a solid mahjong game, so I give it 4 stars. I don't like that it asks you to review it our go on the facebook and stuff even though you own it, but that's my only complaint
B0067Q42BY|5.0|awesome and teaches you how to play even for my 8 year old. great tutorial and graphics! a lot of fun.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Somehow, I had never seen this 1997 film which was based on a true story.  It is about the relationship between an FBI undercover agent and a small-time Mafia gangster and exposes the unique and complex violent world of organized crime.  Al Pacino is cast in the role of an aging Mafia member with a huge number of \\"hit jobs\\" in his past.  His life is a mess. He has cancer, his son is a junky and he has never moved up in the Mafia hierarchy.  Johnny Depp is cast as the FBI agent who has to deal with his own troubled relationship with his wife and children as well as his \\"on the job\\" challenges to infiltrate the Mafia.<br /><br />This is a film about the inner workings of the Mafia.  But it is much more that.  It is the story of the relationship between these two men, Each  with different agendas, and how they come to actually love and respect each other.  And so, in addition to the numerous scenes of murder and violence,  there is a basic humanity to this film which not only held my interest because of the plot, but which gave these two actors roles that were complex and deep and which required outstanding nuanced performances.<br /><br />I loved this film.  It is perfect in every way.  Don't miss it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really like the twist that this game gives it tells a story and adds some new elements to a classic game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play solitaire occassionally and this app allows me to do that on my kindle fire. Best of all the app is free and of good quality. What's not to like.
B005DZMP00|5.0|Am really enjoying this live cd. The Dark Star medley is the center piece but every song is well played. Was shipped out to me very fast!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|go angry birds. I longs this game so much I wish I could make my own angry birds. it would so so awesome.  I. play this game every day it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this a very fun and god game I don't normally review apps but this one is worth it, great selection for the free app of the day,
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is very fun and entertaining ... its so worth every penny I spent.... u can fly upgrade collect unlock the only thing that could make it better would b different levels and stuff....
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun because if you are bored then you play this game and you are not bored anymore.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it. it was easy to lean how to play. lots of fun to play. I really enjoyed this game within minutes of downloading it
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this is interesting so far.....I'm learning a little strategy so time will tell I guess ...... I like games that hook you &amp; so far I'he been hooked :)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The case is very  lightweight and sleek. It doesn't add any unnecessary bulk to the fire and it serves its purpose well.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|it's a lot of fun making long waits not so bad. works great on the fire no lags or freezes
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are cool. they are oh so fun i just cant stop playing I play this all day long. or at least until my kindle dies
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good program, very nice graphics.  I like the different option, classic and unending.  And the adventure is a nice twist.  And really like it because it is free.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|great game for your kindle fire. great graphics. easy enough for the younger crowd too. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle type games.
B006ON41FC|4.0|ejdjjf ijdjd jejjdjej jjdhrh jdjdjjr jdjj idjjc ieh hh hheidi dijejd jjdiei djhdiid djjjdke djjhyxuie ifikejhd xhhevhe djhdiid djjjdke sjidid jjdji
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun animations, goals and variations to make it interesting.  Controls work ok, and failure is amusing since it usually involves slamming into a tree or something else.
B006ON41FC|5.0|rThis is a great game.  My sons and I love playing it. Some parts are frustrating a bit but that is what makes it fun. You will get addicted to it like I did.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I just started playing, but it is fun. easy to understand gameplay. Nice graphics. I'll have to see how the storyline goes, hut so far alright.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have tried the other free mahjong apps and this one being free today is the best value easily. As far as the dev ads I personally don't see anything wrong. If you were a dev you would put your other games up so people can see what you have to offer. These aren't ads like what you pay not to have. If you like mahjong then you got very lucky today. While this game may not be worth 5$ it really would be worth 3$. It has a lot to offer but still fairly simple.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is worth the price. Its definantly a great book for 5-8th graders. If you`ve read the first ones your going to love this.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|it leaves bubbles, looks like cheap crap.  This is the most terrible screen cover i have ever used, without a doubt this company should put a recall on this garbage.  never buying zagg again.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Before I ordered this one, I'd been wondered how many chick-lit stories (my absolute favourite genre) one could read without finally becoming tired of the same old stereotyped main characters etc. I've Got Your Number has renewed my faith that good chick-lit can still be produced by those who know what they're doing, and as (nearly) always, Sophie Kinsella knows how to do it and does it well.  I really love SK's books although I did stop reading the shopaholic series before baby came along, preferring her stand alone novels. I've also been catching up on her Madeline Wickham novels which I have enjoyed too. I've Got Your Number is up there with best of them in my opinion. I loved the characters, the way the story developed and everything else about this book. The ONLY exception to my enjoyment was the footnotes on the kindle version, but I did get used to them so it didn't matter. I so did not want the story to end and kept making myself put the book down just to prolong it. But sadly, I have just finished it and had to write a review so I could share my enjoyment with everyone else.  In summing up, I loved, loved, LOVED this book!!! Would definitely recommend.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I got through the ads and the tutorial, then, when choosing the first game, it froze my Fire and I had to do a hard reset to get it working again. Uninstalled.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a nice workout DVD if you don't mind the 20 minutes of advertisements (that you cannot skip) before the video starts. I also found that it was a bit hard on the knees.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very cool love this game don't like doing reviews but I guess I have to keep writing ok bye now
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Very beautifully done. You can play in a relaxed mode or  challenging mode. Great on my asus transformer prime. I look forward to playing it more.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I like going nuts very fun and addictive....I still wish there where levels an evil bear to defeat and he needs a trusty side kick....oh and check points would be nice!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />I've noticed the newer reviews that have recently come in about ads. This is confusing as I personally do NOT have a single ad showing up before or during game play..<br />I'm also using a Kindle Fire & it DOES WORK. The only reason I can think of, that would give you trouble, would be having TOO MANY RUNNING APPS and/or not enough internal space.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I have NEVER enjoyed Mahjong until this morning!<br />What an incredible game app this is! On the Kindle Fire; the 27 backgrounds are stunningly beautiful. The colors & designs on the mahjong tiles, as well as other elements of the game are intricate, creative & non-repetitive; which makes this Mahjong all that more enjoyable.<br /><br />I have yet, and, I don't believe I will,  come across a stage\level where I've felt bored or, overwhelmed to the point where I just knew I were only wasting my time due to fact the game was purposely SET not to be won. (Yes, some game devs. really do this!)<br /><br />Although, I love this game app & feel its the best I've seen offered by Amazon so far, I'm not sure if I'd pay $4.99. Perhaps $2.99 or $3.49. If I am unable go for too long without obsessively wanting/needing to play the game, only then, would I deem the game worthy of it's asking price. Should this happen, I'll be sure to update my review.<br /><br />I highly recommend this download! You will not regret it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game-some are really challenging. great way to pass the time. takes a while to unlock them as you get farther in the game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great!!!  good for passing time!!! I like the challenges to unlock the new games!  play almost every day!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Well executed game design. Lots of ways to make the game playable on any size of device and many different game options that allow you to choose the right mode for you.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great timer waster, also very glad to see a free app of the day that normally my wife would spend money on!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and it is a great classic game. Just like the classic solitaire card game.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|First let me say, I liked the original movie Happy Feet.  Both of these movies were made for children.  That means most of the people who view Happy Feet 2 are taking their children to see it.  This is basically a cartoon about a dancing penguin.  What is causing all the ANGRY reviews about this movie? Nothing. I think these are FAKE reviews. These are not written as if coming from a parent.  A parent would want to help other parents and tell them in more detail what was wrong with the movie. Almost ALL of the NEGATIVE reviews are strange and hostile in nature. They have such an extreme over-the-top message.  There are several RED flags to prove my statement. Almost ALL of these reviews use words like HATE, SUCK, DON'T BUY, etc. There are just too many copycat reviews.  They actually seem like they were all written by the same person. One review was written that stated they did not like the FIRST Happy Feet. REALLY?  Then WHY would they even be interested in going to see the sequel?  One review said he wished he were deaf and blind. REALLY?  Because of a children's animated movie?  This is not a statement a \\"parent\\" or an intelligent person would make.  Do not believe the negative reviews.  I think they are bogus. Read the positive reviews and take from them what advice you need to decide about Happy Feet 2.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a game worth playing.  I love Mahjong and the different tiles and layouts made playing fun.  The comic that goes along with the quest portion is dorky enough to be kinda amusing, but the game play more then makes up for that.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The ads and splash screen aren't that intrusive. Decent graphics, good game play, looks great on my Xoom tablet. I don't foresee playing this too often but for a FAOTD, it works.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I do not like the level of control this app has when running.  It was too frustrating to even begin playing.  Poor design.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in-1 Games has 121 fun mini games for all ages,  a variety of short quick challenges.  I recommend downloading this app, you won't be sorry...none too hard, some easy but still fun...points to buy more games included
0545265355|5.0|I'm so glad I bought these books as a set. I burned thru all three in a day and a half. Great read!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I read it for the first time when I was 16, and I've read it at least once every year since... I never get tired of reading this book.  Elizabeth Bennett has taught me to never settle when it comes to matters of the heart.  I always find that the middle of the book drags a bit, as I'm not interested on the drama concerning Jane, but Lizzie & Darcy will always bring me back.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I played this game on my laptop a while back and loved it. Really happy it works flawlessly on the Fire. Great clear graphics and cool gameplay. Don't particularly care about following the story, but it's still a super fun game. Highly recommended for Mahjong lovers and KFire owners.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this ap makes one of my favorite time wasters more fun. love the idea of having a story line to go along with the different challenges.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a great manning app!!  You can pick the level you want to play and there are &quot;wild tiles&quot; that can be matched to various tiles.<br /><br /> The only minor complaint I have is the story between each game; yes you can ignore it ....  and the tutorial (it's short)  hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />  There was an ad at the beginning, but I just tapped play and went into the game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|just got it this morning and cant stop playing. its great having challenges and a purpose recommend for all mahjong junkies.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love G5 games and this one is no exception so I'm glad I caught the free deal today. The gameplay is fluid and the graphics are beautiful, with the exception of the cut scene comics. Those are kind of crummy. I've yet to experience any of those ads that others are complaining about, so I have nothing to add on that front. Perhaps after a couple hours of gameplay.<br /><br />But all in all, this game is satisfactory.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i luv air hockey! ive always wanted a air hockey app! i also love the other games. especially the soccer game. its really easy and fun.
B006ON41FC|4.0|really fun and cute. I bought this game because I liked the little squirrel but its really fun also! lol
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game works great on the kindle.fire it is fun and it has missions and goals and its an addicting and endless game LOVE IT
B006ON41FC|5.0|I bought this game and it was totally worth it.  I cant stop playing it!  I also think its fun to finish the goals.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|it works great on kkindle fire, but the game gets pretty boring after a while, it has a story too.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think this is a very cool game because it gives you a chance to have a challenge. and it also lets you learn to move your fingers and eyes more faster.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|this is a good game but for $5 not worth it i got it as faotd its good but not great. the ads on this paid app are a downfall as well.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I like this game. The graphics are good, and it operates smoothly with out crashing ever. Give it a try if you like tower defence type games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Sometimes in life for me one would think how does she even have time to breathe, let alone meet with God. This app reminds me and helps me slow down and take a needed moment... what a difference. Its easy to set up and easy to use. Definetly five stars.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love Mahjongg and this game is awesome! The quest gives it a whole new twist, lots of fun. Very good game!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I downloaded this for my ASUS Transformer Prime tablet and it is flawless. The graphics are great and the music is quite enjoyable. A top quality game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have no problems with a developer advertising his own apps. Quite useful actually. Even Angry Birds, one of the highest rated apps, advertises its own products. For an excellent $5 app as the Faotd I'll gladly take the ads. Works great on the Kindle Fire. For HD and clarity of tiles this is one of the best manning games available.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So, I made the mistake of reading some of the negative reviews before reading this book, so I was glad to read the book and think, \\"What were those people talking about?\\" This is not typically the kind of book I would read. I like things to be lighthearted with a guaranteed happy ending. I found this book to be heart wrenching, exciting, well told, cliffhanging, heart stopping, and life changing. I can't help it. I only decided to read it because a few of my friends had been talking about it and every time I visited the Kindle book store it was sitting there begging me to buy it. I decided that I should give it a chance and that made all of the difference. I am so glad I read this. Once I started reading the book it was too late to stop anyway, so here I am beginning Mocking Jay, staying up late hours and obsessing over the outcome of Panem. I tend to be one of those who reads the big epic pop culture book series like \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Twilight\\", but never has there been a time that I liked a character so much as Katniss Everdeen. She is strong, she does what she has to do, but is still vulnerable. I read a review from someone who said she was the worst character ever who was completely unlikable and had no redeeming qualities. After reading the book I realized that the person who wrote that review was so very wrong. Katniss is amazing and you'd be hard pressed to find a character as fascinating and kick butt. Peeta is another of my favorite characters, EVER! He is selfless, kind and strong. I can't explain the way my heart breaks during certain scenes in this book. I have to admit that I am not nearly as connected to Gale as to Peeta. I guess if there is the old stupid \\"Twighlight Teams thing\\" going on that I'd be all the way Team Peeta, lol. Some parts to the book are pretty brutal, but not too much to handle. I thought I was going to have a problem with some of it, but it just added to the suspense of the novel. All in all, this book is not just worth a read, its a book that will make you think, a book that will make you route, a book that will make your heart break a little. I loved it!ts a book that will make you think, a book that will make you route, a book that will make your heart break a little. I loved it!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is one of the funniest tv shows to come out in years! I highly recommend it if you want a good laugh!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I tried the free version a while back and was excited to see it as the free app of the day. I honestly don't see why the bad reviews. It has one add which really isn't an add because it only shows the other games G5 has... graphics are great and play is entertaining. I just don't see giving it horrible reviews because your impatient or your device's screen is to small... that isn't the games fault. Get it now while its free... who doesn't like free!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I heard Tattoo ONCE on the radio before I bought this, but either way I wanted \\"Truth\\" being that it was David Lee Roth back with Van Halen...For as much hot & cold reviews I've heard, I say this: This is better than any album Van Halen has done with Sammy Hagar & Gary Cherone. The songs are great, full of rock & roll and revolve around VH's early work along with fresh new hooks & riffs. Roth is Roth and you either love him or hate him. \\"Stay Frosty\\" has to be one of the best VH songs I ever heard and I LOVE Tattoo as well. I just would have liked a group photo or photo's in the CD Jacket. Wolfgang Van Halen does a great job on bass, and although I would have rather had Michael Anthony back, I will take what I can get...Everybody knows that Van Halen's band history is full of as many issues as it is insane guitar work, so having said that, it's just great to have the original Van Halen back with one more Van Halen in the lineup if that's what it takes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its def not the best game ever, but it is a great game to play if you have time to kill
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great game. It is very addicting. I would recommend this game to everyone. Also, it's free so why not buy it?
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is fun. its good for waiting like in a waiting room or if waiting for a friend or something it is good to pass the time. buy it
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Challenging game. I love the layouts of the tiles. It is just FUN! I lost track of time while playing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game works really well on the kindle fire. its really fun and easy to play. glad I downloaded it for free.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thank you, Amazon, for such a fine free app. Just started playing, but it seems really excellent so far. Yea!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It is great and easy yet challenging!!! Quest mode is fun and I love the golden tiles!!! G5 has great games that are appropriate for all ages!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|At least we got 121 games. Its good. But its hard.I like it very good.  I wish the games were better.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Its a fun game but when I get some gear it doesn't show up.Frustrating is the word I'm looking for.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I started off listening to this in the background as I did some cleaning and enjoyed it, and as I gradually took the time to listen to the album more attentively, I enjoyed it even more. With the exception of one song I like less, this is a great debut album as a whole that has quickly become a favorite.<br /><br />The album offers a good set of songs and lyrics to sing along to, and a good balance of up-tempos and ballads. A fun feel overall, infused with the right doses of wit, sweetness and heart.<br /><br />I hesitated to get this, but ended up really pleased with it. Good ol' country album with the ability to appeal to a broader audience. And I'm convinced: this band is the real deal. Looking forward to future music!
B005K17RU0|4.0|great quick look at local weather. Have not had problems mentioned in other reviews, may have been fixed? This is good because I am new to this technology.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I find it so disconcerting, to say the least, to note the disparity in file sizes between this app as the FAOTD (40.8 Mb) and the paid (full) version on the Android Market (8.35Mb), that I'm leery of even downloading this game.  :-(  Ordinarily, I'd consider it totally unfair of me to write a review without using or even downloading the app in question.  Considering, however, this great disparity in file size, the fact that the developers make no reference as to why this difference should exist, and finally, the plethora of comments regarding self-ads, I'm more than just a little cautious of even beginning this download.  It's too bad, because I usually like Mahjong games and the graphics  in this app (usually a factor in playing Mahjong on a phone) appear well done.  Maybe I'm needlessly cautious, but my concern is enough in this case to force me to proceed no farther.
B006ON41FC|3.0|very repetitive... also challenges won't stack... get 200 nuts, get 500 nuts, 1000, 2000... etc.. slightly addicting .. but power ups are very limited and only apply to items that are single use then buy again...
B005H1SDQU|5.0|I started out as a relatively strong Hackett fan having purchased each of his 1st 6 solo releases and having essentially lost interest in Genesis after WIND AND WUTHERING. Those first 4 (solos) were quite good even the inconsistent PLEASE DON'T TOUCH (c'mon, Randy Crawford?). I found CURED particularly hideous and HIGHLY STRUNG only slightly better. And that's where it ended for many, many years. As one reviewer so aptly put in another review (and I'm paraphrasing) \\"as much as I admire Hackett and his abilities, no Hackett album has fully satisfied me.\\" Even with those great early records, tracks like \\"Leaving,\\" \\"The Toast\\" and \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" bored me to tears. So I walked away from Hackett after HIGHLY STRUNG without any great reservations. I figured he peaked early like so many other of my favorite artists. I checked back with GUITAR NOIR in '93 and knew I hadn't missed anything. Sounded like standard album rock (Asia) to me. Thanks for the good times Steve. GENESIS REVISITED was nice but I preferred the originals. And again, that's where it ended.<br /><br />It wasn't until earlier this year when trying to decide upon which CDs to spend a Christmas gift certificate at a local record store that I noncommitedly picked up SHROUDED HORIZON as one of my selections. As a 2CD album there just might be a couple of tracks that'll be worth it. Wow, was I wrong! There are fully 22 tracks worth hearing. Even slower, poppier cuts like \\"Looking for Fantasy\\" and \\"Til These Eyes\\" are artfully done. Unlike many Hackett fans I have absolutely no problem with his voice. I'd much rather hear a  less-than-perfect lead voice singing with heart (the songs he composed, no less) than the plethora of cliched poseurs littering the pop and rock fields.<br /><br />Mechanically and artistically he doesn't seem to have lost a step at all. In fact his so-called \\"shredding\\" is every bit as explosive as in decades past. His progressive tracks are the most original within the genre inthe entire 21st century, in fact since the seventies, I'll venture a guess. I also believe his more pastoral/acoustic selections (which comprise a significant portion of his repertoire) are better realized compositionally. I had my doubts years earlier when I read of his blues affections. I may have to go back and give BLUES WITH A FEELING a try. On this album his blues piece \\"Catwalk\\" is a scorcher. And bluesy riffs infiltrate many numbers with great effect. Hackett, it appears, given his penchant for blues, classical, rock and world stylings in recent years has a better grasp on dynamics and composition than ever before.<br /><br />I was so pleased with this CD that I (within days) purchased TUNNEL'S MOUTH, METAMORPHEUS, TO WATCH THE STORMS and TOKYO TAPES with LIVE RAILS on deck. His current band is a creative powerhouse and I can't wait to hear more than the 30 second snippets to LIVE RAILS.<br /><br />Finally, so pleased was I with OUT OF THE TUNNEL'S MOUTH also, that I conclude Steve Hackett has never released two finer albums in succession than BEYOND THE SHROUDED HORIZON and TUNNEL'S MOUTH. And after 35+ years that's saying a mouthful.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Sometimes it is hard to understand what some tiles stand for. I feel they should just stick to certain characters instead of all the random symbols.
0307888681|5.0|Don't be deceived by the characterization that this is \\"just another science fiction book about zombies\\".  Rather, this is an exceptional book that delves into a critical (yet sometimes pithy) analysis of strategy.  It is a subtle indictment of those who engage in group-think and are wedded to the inappropriate and sole use  of technology to solve all problems.  Now widely read by military professionals from the lowest enlisted troop to generals, this is a delightful and thought provoking book written in an entertaining prose.  It is a page-turner!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Super fun game. Extremely addictive! My only complaint is that I'm constantly being pestered for a five star review. So this game gets a 4 star reveiw.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I just LOVE this album! Maroon 5 has such a good Pop/Rock feel to it. It also really helps that Adam Levine is soooo smokin' hot!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I sent the first book of this series in one of my husband's care packages while he was fighting in southern Afghanistan last year. The very next time we talked he asked me to send the other two right away because he couldn't wait to read them. Briefly entertaining my husband during that time had already put Suzanne Collins at the top of my \\"favorite authors\\" list, but this weekend I finally downloaded the trilogy on my kindle. I lost sleep and and weight, did quite a bit of shocked gasping, and washed dishes one-handed to avoid putting it down. I haven't read anything this good in a very long time.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is so fun! Maroon 5 has a great Pop/Rock sound and I absolutely love it! It also helps that Adam Levine is sooooo hot! Haha! Anyway, I think this is a fantastic purchase.

B005F96URI|5.0|Another great straight to DVD/Blu-Ray movie, Banraku has some good action, humor, and a great cast.  This is a very interesting martial arts type movie involving a mixed nationality of characters, and is filmed much like as if it were a play.  There are also some periodic elements in this movie that would likely appease gamers, comic book lovers, and western lovers as well.  I found this to be an all around entertaining movie, and I would say it's definitely worth a watch, if not a purchase.  I for one will be picking this up on Blu-Ray at some point.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|it is a good time. the quest for solving puzzles is really fun especially if you used to play regular mahjong tiles at all.

1451627289|5.0|Now when you read this book title and then the synopsis you may be scratching your head.  Stephen King?  Where is the murderous gore?  A pet Cemetery?  Possessed car?  A spooky clown?  (well, actually the clown is mentioned in this book in a brilliant way....)<br /><br />But no.  No gore.  No horror.  A new more user-friendly version of King that I feel will reap new readers.<br /><br />In its place, is a fascinating story of \\"what if\\".  Mixed facts (the place, the Oswald's, Kennedy) with fiction.  The result?  Brilliance.<br /><br />I listened to this on audio.... yes 30+ hours long and probably the longest audio I have ever listened to.  I loved it from the start.  There was no warm up session here... from the very beginning I loved it.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, King had first thought about this book in 1972, 9 years after the assassination, and right before the release of his first novel, Carrie.  He decided to put that thought on the back burner as it would require too much research while he was teaching full-time.  Initially King thought it would be titles Split Track.<br /><br />11-22-63 is such a powerful book.  Stephen King did an amazing job smoothly traveling back and forth between 2011 and 1958, switching between cell phones and twenty-five cent burgers.  The walk back in time was real enough for me to feel that I was walking along those streets of 1958 - 1963, scoping out a very real and very dangerous Lee Harvey Oswald.  Even listening to the climax of this book made the hairs on my neck stand on end.... perhaps, it felt a little to real to the actual event?<br /><br />At the end of the audio, do not miss out of Stephen Kings own words about the book, the research and his recommendation of books to read to learn more about the assassination. A couple of the titles I managed to write down:<br /><br />Marina and Lee by Priscilla Johnson<br /><br />Case Closed by Gerald Posner<br /><br />Oswald's Tale by Norman Mailer<br /><br />For me I can not stress enough that you must take time to read or listen to this book.  Audio lovers, you are in for a treat - Craig Wasson was fantastic... and that even does not seem like a strong enough word.  I loved listening to this and I will miss it now that it is over.  Easily the best audio I have listened to this year.reat - Craig Wasson was fantastic... and that even does not seem like a strong enough word.

6305922756|5.0|I think this DVD is a must have for your collection. But only if this film appeals to you. It's funny amazingly creative but keep your eyes and ears open so you don't miss it. You will watch it again and again. A cult classic in a category all its own. Rob Rieners finest hour! Surprisingly it has true to life elements in this film as well. You wont believe who appears in this film and they do a fantastic job acting. It's rock and roll, it's comedy, it's one of kind and is definitely SPINAL TAP! What more could you want. Thanks Rob! Two thumbs up, 5 stars and they earned them. If I have to explain this film to you, you wont like it. You either get it or you never will. That makes this classic DVD very special to me. No you can not borrow it. I lock it in my safe! Buy your own copy. In fact, don't touch my copy, don't even look at it. No you cant point to it, it still has the tag on it. No you don't get it and now you don't deserve to own this film. Make sure the volume on your TV is set to eleven! Not 10, not 12, but exactly eleven! Enjoy!

So I decided to order Catching Fire and Mockingjay from Amazon.<br /><br />It turned out to be the best decision ever, because I got them in the mail a few days later, and still never heard from back from the library. I was able to finish the second book and I'm already on the third.<br /><br />I will continue to use Amazon due to their fast service and the great products they offer.

0596009208|4.0|This book is a great resource for my beginning Java students. I suggest that they buy this as a supplement to the text book to help them understand java basics. Like the difference between a class and a object. I hope the author's are working on a newer version to correspond with Java 7. I gave it four stars because this book focuses on an older version of java (yet the fundamentals are the same).  As a Computer Programming professor I would recommend this book!!

B0061S073A|4.0|Thx 2 the kid proof block / restriction, it is often difficult to get the exit screen to open!  However, I will deal.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I loved this series (even more so after watching the 1st episode of Spartacus).  The actors/actresses in Rome play their parts so wonderfully that it's hard not to like them all - even those who are supposed to be \\"villains.\\"  The scenery is that of a big budget movie. And though they may have not followed the history exactly as it was, they do give a good sense of that time period. There is a good bit of nudity, but that was a big part of that culture and it's often just the beginning or end- not long scenes that distract from the plot.  I found the series to be more focused on thought than action (compare Elizabeth to 300).  It kept me and my husband so interested that we watched nothing else for weeks (if we didn't have 2 toddlers, we would have finished it off in a couple of days!).  My biggest complaint is that it felt rushed and covered such a short time period.  Also, the fight scenes are only a few brief minutes.  I don't need to see a bunch of killing, but I would have like to have seen some of the strategy behind one of history's greatest armies.  Oh well, I would still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys period pieces or just complicated plots with conspiracies lurking around every corner.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actually read the first two books free on prime and then was going to have to wait 2 weeks to read the third.  Couldn't wait and I liked it so well I knew I'd read the series again, so opted to buy the trilogy Kindle.  I read on both Iphone and Kindle 1.  I did not have any problems with the formating in either case so either they have fixed the complaints mentioned in prior posts or it isn't a problem for everyone.  I read the complaints on not liking the third book's ending as well as the others. I agree as a stand alone book I would not have liked it as well, but as a wrap up of the other two and because I have lived with the characters for over a week, I loved the third book.  I wasn't disappointed at all in the ending.  I do feel the author rushed the ending a bit and could have made it a longer book, and definitely has an opening to write a 4th, however, her writing still has me hooked from the beginning and her pace keeps me moving and not putting it down.  I'm not sure I am going to like a movie, the gore and action on film might be more than I would like but in a book I can handle it.  And I don't ever seem to like movies of books that are written as first person. It always seems to fall short as it is very hard to capture the details and feelings like the book.  I'll still go see it.  The price of the trilogy in kindle format is a great deal.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like it. It is fun. Majong with a storyline, rocks. Good enough graphics. Music is ok. Will recommend to friends.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wanted to write a review on this book because I had read some of the negatives and even though I wanted to finish the series I was expecting not to like it.  But I loved it.  Yes it moved a little faster and in a hurry and the author definitely could have gotten another book to the series.  But I loved it. I was not in the least disappointed in the ending and actually want a book to follow up on life after the war. The whole series was terrific and I couldn't put any of the books down.  I had to finish in wee hours of night, and late for work.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Repetitive but fun, slow start but when you get the hang of it you can do all sorts of things

B006MHWXMS|4.0|This is a simple but powerful app giving you a chance to have multiple lists and subjects with due dates and photos as a means to organize and optimize. the program complements Google tasks while giving you a chance to quickly reference the task at hand.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|I would not have watched this movie had it not been for the positive reviews here on Amazon.com, but I'm glad I did.  The acting really was superb, as Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain do a great job of showing us the slow unraveling of a typical family and their interactions with one another. Their emotion is, for the most part, understated (except for a few very emotional scenes by Chastain as the wife), which is what makes the film so interesting to watch. You can see the internal conflicts deepen in Shannon through his facial expressions, not in explosions of behavior.  What I like most is that the family decides to deal with what they think is psychotic behavior on the father's part, in a very loving manner. They stick together to try to make things work even though it seems at times that the father is totally off his rocker.  I was okay that the ending is not very climactic because it was resolved in the same way as the rest of the film - with an understated sense of urgency and doom.  This movie could have easily gotten religious or just plain stupid, but it did neither of these. The director kept the movie visually appealing while developing the characters just enough to create a slow burn of tension and interest. Though I've read some reviews that imply the daughter, who is deaf, is a symbol of the community, which refuses to believe the father's visions, I took her to be more of an extension of the father's character. He seems \\"normal\\" in most regards, but his dreams and ensuing behavior lead him to be an outcast in many ways. And he, like the daughter, has a chance to be more \\"normal\\" (she through surgery and he through medication) but aren't able to take that route.  In summary, I definitely recommend this film.
1433502410|5.0|This translation of the Bible is amazing! Very accurate, this was done using several experts in the field, also was done word by word instead of phrase by phrase as some translations have been done, thereby preserving the original intent the writer had when writing down the scripture. I also absolutely love the maps, and extra articles inside, which really help one to visualize the narrative, and to understand what was trying to be imparted to the reader. I highly recommend this translation, especially in view of recent efforts by some to alter the original Bible by removing gender references and passages not deemed as meeting today's so-called standards.
B0063GORYU|4.0|like the challenge of getting ahead, getting buried and reconstructing again. less frusterating than regular solitaire but just as difficult. always trying to top my lowest number of moves

B005LAIGW8|3.0|I think everyone had the urge to run outside and kick the ugliest puppy in their neighborhood when it was announced a second Ghost Rider movie was going into production starring a returning Nicolas Cage. The director of the original Ghost Rider (Mark Steven Johnson) was out and the directors of Crank (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) were in. Now that it's been released it's been getting nothing but a barrage of negative reviews pretty much anywhere you can think of. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is practically a reboot and could serve as a full on reset of the franchise if Cage wasn't attached. With everything working against this requel (that's reboot + sequel combined) and every entertainment site on the planet practically guaranteeing its atrocity, I seem to be one of the few critics in existence who was actually entertained by this movie.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has gone into seclusion in Eastern Europe. Johnny fights not only the urge to become The Rider, but fights to stay hidden from those who are hunting for him. That is until a man named Moreau (Idris Elba) shows up on his doorstep offering Johnny a second chance and a way to lift his curse. The offer gives Johnny a chance for revenge against Roarke (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who's Lucifer himself in human form and the man Blaze made a deal with to become The Rider in the first place. The one catch is Johnny has to guard and protect a boy that Roarke is searching for to fulfill the prophecy of becoming the antichrist.<br /><br />The main attraction to this movie was how it looked. There's this featurette that highlights just how camera oriented Neveldine and Taylor are when they come to shooting their movies. Seeing Neveldine basically risk his life rollerblading on the back of a motorcycle or hanging off of a wire along with the stuntman just to get the shot was incredibly intriguing to me. Unique perspective and fascinating camera work is something I look for in movies and Spirit of Vengeance let you know it had that in the trailers. The flaw in this method though is that even though it gets you up close and personal with the action it also feels really shaky at times. It seems very rough in comparison to dolly tracks or tripods being used. The camera work also involves those slight zoom-ins at random intervals to make it seem like the camera wasn't in the right place when they started shooting.<br /><br />I'm hearing a lot of people complain about the special effects, but those are another high point. Ghost Rider's appearance is more charred in comparison to how he looked in the first movie. His skull looks scorched, his leather clothes are melted, and the steel on his motorcycle is noticeably red hot and altered thanks to his transformation. The fire looks pretty fantastic all around and there's plenty of it. Everything The Rider drives becomes engulfed in flames and the special effects crew has a ton of fun with that. Maybe it looks terrible in 3D? I was going to recommend seeing it in 2D anyway. Johnny Blaze's transformations into Ghost Rider are pretty sweet, too. Seeing his eyes sink in for the first time is a bit unsettling, but it becomes a trademark. As he holds off The Rider the majority of the movie, his eyes are the first thing to show the transformation. It was a bit reminiscent of the T-1000 being shot in the face in the steel mill at the end of Terminator 2.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is exactly what you expect him to be here. The issue is that like always he's way too over the top during intense moments and not emotional enough during the quieter ones. The best example is when Johnny Blaze and Nadya (Violante Placido) are trying to catch up with the men who took Danny (Fergus Riordan) who's Nadya's son and the boy who's set to become the antichrist. Johnny and Nadya are interrogating a man named Vasil. Notice how twitchy Cage becomes here and how crazy he becomes during his \\"bad man\\" and \\"scraping at the door\\" speech. It's pretty insane inthis so bad it's good kind of way. Cage's performance seems to evolve throughout the movie and he almost seems sincere by the end of it. Cage also modeled The Rider's movements off of his pet cobra and it's blatantly obvious. His performance as The Rider is full of rigid movements, swaying motions, and quick cuts. It's very bizarre, especially when it gets to the scene where The Rider is floating around in circles on his back as if he's duplicating Trent Reznor in the Nine Inch Nails video for \\"Closer.\\"<br /><br />You'll wish Idris Elba's wine-loving Moreau had more screen time than he actually does as the Moreau character is generally pretty interesting, but doesn't really get a chance to shine. He does have a few really memorable scenes though. This will make more sense after you see it, but the \\"decay vision\\" gets a little bothersome. It's like looking at the action through a giant peephole or fishbowl. The evolution of the Carrigan character (played by Johnny Whitworth) is pretty awesome though.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is not as bad as people are making it out to be or maybe it is and it's just really entertaining anyway. The dialogue does get really cheesy at times (\\"You're the devil's baby mama.\\"), but the story and part of the screenplay were written by David S. Goyer so that should give you a little bit of hope. The special effects are fantastic, Cage's performance eventually grows on you, and Spirit of Vengeance is a huge step up from the original movie overall. In the end, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is explosively entertaining and just the type of brainless fun you need to forget about a hectic week.formance seems to evolve throughout the movie and he almost seems sincere by the end of it.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|I've been playing the game and so far I've only seen one ad (on the main screen)  and it was very easy to bypass. I love Mahjong tiles so I don't see a problem with that one ad especially since this $4.99 app was free today.

0446547654|1.0|I've never written a book review but I just finished reading The Best of Me and felt compelled to convey how disgusted it left me.  Nicholas Sparks has a predictable formula that has left me disappointed after reading his last few books.  So I'm mad at myself for thinking that would change with this book.  I'm also getting perturbed at his recycled story ideas that end the same way.  The Amanda and Dawson storyline held so much promise, as did the characters of Dawson's cousins and the Bonner family.  But I could almost hear Sparks yelling \\"Gotcha!\\" as I got 2/3 of the way into the book and predicted exactly how the story would end.  Predictable, convenient, unrealistic, trite and pandering.  I won't be adding any more of Sparks' books to my library.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Although it took a little getting used to with some variations of the traditional rules, it is a fun twist to the original game. Graphics are great. Story comic strip is a little quirky, but I like that it has a story mode.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Okay game, but a HUGE drain on my battery. Don't like the ads at startup, and the fact it has to reload if you switch to another app then switch back. Also could have done a better job of making it more friendly for colorblind people.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Positives - I love the ability to make the type larger, the ease of taking along multiple books and the way it automatically keeps your place.  Challenges - some books load easier than others, the battery life is shorter than I would like especally for long airline flights.  All in all a great gift that we have enjoyed.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Kinda a crazy, creepy, fantastic story!  Beautiful, too.  It is hard for me to put into words what I thought of this book because it was just so different.  The imagery was intense, felt like I was there.  Would actually LOVE to see this made into a screenplay, but not sure it could do the book justice.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|From beginning to end RATM is just plain awesome! The music is politically and emotionally charged. Well written and well performed. Easily one of the best bands to come out of the 90's.

I kinda wished I bought the book instead of the kindle version so I could lend it out to my friends.  Oh well, I guess they will have to buy their own :-)
B006C1DH92|3.0|I like how they added the tomato and the Bandito mode.is a very well thought out idea, but the game is much easier than the original. If you compare the speed at which the fruits fly up in this version to regular fruit ninjas you will see what I mean. But, it is worthwhile app.

I read over 150 pages without being interested; but I kept reading in hopes there would be a sudden reason to continue. The old photographs are the best thing, and may be the only good thing, about the book. However, the photos made me think more about the author's process than about the story. Did Riggs find the pictures first & create the book; or did he write the book then go looking for photos? Either way, it was often hard to relate the photos to the book. In fact, I found myself constantly going back and rereading in case I'd missed something. Many pictures seemed to have been inserted for no reason, except they were interesting to the author. There are places in the story where I became interested in a character; but most of the characters were flat and poorly drawn. Probably two of the most uninteresting characters were the 16-year-old narrator and Miss Peregrine. To sum up the problems I had with the book, it had no real ending. Nothing was resolved. It was just a way to set up the reader for sequels.  This book is billed by Amazon as for age 13 and up. If I were an adult buying for a child, I'd read this one before giving it. The \\"horror\\" scenes are filled with what seems to be gratuitous violence for violence's sake. I'm glad it was a gift. I hate to have paid for it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First I want to say that I got this video VERY fast. I put in my order in the evening of Feb 16 and it was delivered the morning of the 18th.<br /><br />I tried this video for the first time the night I got it and I could not even finish it. I made it about 10 mins in. I tried it again this morning and I was able to finish it but I really had to force myself to keep going.<br /><br />There are 3 levels and each level has a 2 min warm up then 3 circuits of 3 mins strength 2 mins cardio and 1 min abs then a 2 minute cool down. Someone who works out a lot might not find this as hard as I did but for someone like me who is out of shape and trying to lose weight and tone up this video would be a fantastic way to do it. And I haven't even made it to the harder workouts yet.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Lots of levels and cute characters, nice twist for a puzzle game. love the pirate watermelons.
1416972242|3.0|** spoiler alert ** Wow what can i say? I love this series so far and i love Cassandra Clare's writing but this just wasn't one of my favorites at all. Just because the book frustrated me so so much. I really hope it gets better in the next book.<br /><br />Clary is a great character the only thing is she really needs to get her emotions straight! because in the beginning she's totally into Jace but then she wants to be with Simon and then at the end she's totally into Jace again even though she gets shot down? and for me as a reader its extremely annoying because i get so into the characters that every time Clary gets hurt by these guys it tears me apart to so you can imagine why it took me so long to read this book because of so much heartache!<br /><br />I know it's kind of weird to want Jace and Clary to be together because their brother and sister but its a fairytale world so anythings okay right? In the City of Bones i was so for her and Jace being together but in City of Ashes i was really rooting for Simon which is why when he died a bunch of times i was very sad.<br /><br />One thing i totally forgot about was that Alec was gay! When the stuff happened with him and the Mangus Bane i was totally caught of guard but then i remembered that in the first book he had a little crush on Jace!<br /><br />I felt so bad for Jace though because his parents basically gave up on him and even though he has this tough guy no one can hurt me attitude he had to of been a little crushed. I mean Maryse didn't believe him when he said things she didn't trust him and then she kicked him out and had him taken away and put in like a cage i mean who does that? I'm glad that everything worked out okay for him in the end though.<br /><br />Well usually my reviews are a bit longer but since this book frustrated me i don't have much else to say. Other then i hope the third book is a lot better!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Like so many things these days the book is a bit overhyped. It was however, entertaining and hard to put down. Katniss, the protagonist, is very sure of herself in some ways and yet very conflicted in others. It's interesting to see her try to figure herself out while the excitement of the games goes on.Don 't expect any intellectual comment on government or society, its just an interesting, and entertaining read.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I lost interest in the HP series with \\"The order of the Phoenix\\". The Twilight series has held my interest all the way. This series is not as dark as HP and as I have to deal with depression as it is I don't need its darkness. The conflicts of Twilight are entertaining. I especially liked the birth scene (or should I say births? It was well done as was the honeymoon scene. Well worth the money I spent on it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love this game and its free bonus. Get it you won't be disappointed it's free and it gives you something to do and it keeps you entertained.
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to read cards especially in landscape mode. clean interface. ads appear before game starts but not in an intrusive way. I like the minimal approach because there is no distraction from the game.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like it must keep typing some a words here and there almost to twenty just a couple more should do it
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|The good:  beautiful locales in Paris and Venice.<br />The bad:  boring, botoxed Jolie and bland, bumbling, Depp bring nothing to the film or each other.<br />The ugly:  the supposedly big plot twist is so transparent, it had me at hello.  The film editing is awful with very obvious places where actors are just holding for the camera in hopes they can cut and paste in some interest later.<br /><br />Any resemblance to the clever and sparkling caper films (Charade, To Catch a Thief) is non-existent.<br />Personally, I must admit to avoidance of anything with Ms. Jolie, however, Johnny Depp is usually interesting.  Not so here.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice animation and fun game easy to use also good variety of ways to play.  I like solitaire so using it on android is great.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very enjoyable.  The game adds adventure and mystery with the included story.  Great idea well executed.  I am looking forward to Chapter 2.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a cool free app. haven't unlocked too many games but it is decent so far... definitely recommend as an app for kids or killing time
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop. This app is very enjoyable! It is great for ages 12 and up. I hope u like it!
B002WPVNOS|5.0|One Republic's \\"Waking Up\\" contains an emotionally driven set of songs from track one to eleven plus one (the Amazon Exclusive Version contains a cover of Duffy's \\"Mercy\\").  The album does not skip a beat with its energetic instrumentation of pulsating rhythms that breathes into the band's initial sound as well as a tinge of influences that are undeniable from The Beatles, U2, and Coldplay.  All of the tracks are deeply intimate and intense that has a somewhat subtle theme of treading on.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Made For You\\" contains a thumping intro and inter-play of Ryan Tredder's signature vocals and the string and chorale arrangements a la the Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" which is identifiable and perfectly flows into the next track \\"All The Right Moves.\\"  \\"Moves\\" along with the other singles off the album \\"Secrets\\" and \\"Good Life\\" possess a powerful musical executions and memorable choruses that pound with much exuberance from beginning to end.  The band slows the tempo with the following tracks that sound very much like Coldplay and U2 \\"Fear\\" and the title track \\"Waking Up.\\"  But beyond the comparisons, the piano ballad \\"All this Time\\" is simply unforgettable.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Waking Up\\" is an album worth listening to and adding to one's play list.  With its revolving theme of longing and waiting and marching to a beat of one's own, there is sure to be several favorite songs that may prompt the listener to replay with the volume set louder than usual.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Good quality mahjong game. A bit small for droid incredible screen. Can zoom in, but would be nice if you didn't have to zoom in to read the story on quest mode.
B00005JM0B|5.0|About two decades ago, maybe closer to three, a friend strongly recommended viewing \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day.\\" I hesitated. I just didn't like Arnold Schwartzenegger movies all that well. He persisted saying this was much different. Since he had the VHS tape, it was easy. Well, that was one of the best movies I'd seen in years. It was action, action, action, plus it was funny. Great movie!<br /><br />Well, now the Terminator is our Governator and there's not all that much action in Sacramento. So be it. The term is near the end. As I was looking through the discount DVD bins at my local Ross Store, I found \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\\" I heard that it wasn't as good as Terminator 2, but  what the hey, it was under three bucks. Well, it was a good, highly entertaining movie. Action, action, action from beginning to end. It was one long, elaborate chase movie, and quite well done!<br /><br />I don't watch stuff like this for the story. It''s just way to far fetched. I can't get into it. Don't take me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie but the story was just a way of stringing the action together. Man, what a chase! I've never seen so many cars and assorted property destroyed in such a short time! The movie must have cost a major fortune to make and how did they ever manage to do it in the midst of the city? It's awe inspiring! And the sets were magnificent! No expenses spared. I'm amazed at the whole thing. Who cares about the story? It's modern day Superman against a space-age Wonder Woman and a struggle to the death for both. And it's funny. I suppose most people woulldn't consider it to be a comedy, but it is. Arnold is quite droll, and hilarious. It's excellent entertainment. I wouldn't rate it as high as Terminator 2, but if you like stuff like this, it's well worth viewing.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is great !!!! people say the ads are horrible and everything, hut the only ads I saw were the ones in the beginning. the ads aren't bad. If you like Mahjong Tiles,  THEN GET THIS GAME! !!!!!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|well I read the reviews and decided to get it. then I came across a review for kindle fire. I am using a kindle fire to write this review. maybe it just didn't work for your kindle fire cause it works great for mine. I love the game! it was the free app of the day so that made it even better. I hope you find my review helpful!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Very fun and worth the price. I like having a storyline to add to the game. Would be a good game for kids.

B006ON41FC|5.0|so you wouldn't expect a flying game where the main goal is to eat nuts to be fun right??? well put that thought to the side because this is the best game ever...i am 14 years old and was instantly addicted to it......plus the picture was amazing on my kindle fire
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love that it has a story line and its not just a repetative board game. If you love a challenge then this is the game.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great application.  I'm glad they put this out for free, it gave me a chance to experience mahjong in a different way.
B00170MYIS|5.0|Daughter likes having another battery for her camera-she takes a lot of pics. Highly recommended-seems to hold a long charge.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|Buyer beware: if you are ordering the case in a color besides black, one side of the case will be black and the other side of the case will be the color that you chose. Hence, I wanted mine in all white and instead I have a black/white case. Additionally, the stand is nothing to boast about because most of the time it doesn't work. I think the retail price on this case should be $15. I wouldn't spend anymore for it
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really enjoy this game... The graphics are amazing and it was free when I got it. Can't beat that!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hardly think I can add to the glowing reviews already here... more of the same.<br /><br />I've had a Kindle for about 3 years now and I've read at least 150 books d/l from Amazon in that time. Many of them superb reads. But I have yet to actually throw out a review... I suppose, mostly due to the fact that most of those reads are from established authors. I have recently started to delve into some of the self-published works and have found most of them lacking in either the editing or the overall character of the work.<br /><br />Wool not only surpasses, by a WIDE margin, the quality in all respects of these other self-published titles, but is simply a magnificent read compared to ANY other. Smart. Interesting. Perfectly paced. Well-drawn characters. Interesting idea of building on the original short story.<br /><br />Gush much?! All I can say is keep 'em coming. I will be checking out the author's other works soon and can't wait for the next Wool.<br /><br />Outstanding.<br /><br />Jeff (not Mary)<br /><br />P.S. a character makes an incorrect reference in an internal monologue in the last book (can't elaborate - spoiler). That's it. That's THE THING wrong with Wool! =)
B006ON41FC|3.0|Was a bit addicting at first but then it starts to get old. I don't mind the Open Feint prompts too much but might follow the instructions to disable them.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Plays well on the fire. Had enjoyed the free demo so glad to see this one today. Would highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't like to be asked to upgrade every time I use an app.  The games provided are fun, entertaining. I just ignore the ads.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked the games. Most of the games were nt as good as I thought they would be but I liked most of them.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the bitter, negative reviews of the new Van Halen album are completely UNJUSTIFIED! The first song isn't that great and like other reviewers, I got a little concerned about the whole album after hearing Tattoo. Then I listened to the rest of the songs and was impressed to say the least. Simply put, the music is new so you have to give it a chance. I remember listening to '1984' for the first time and the only songs I really liked were Jump and Panama. Then the more I listened to the whole album, the more I realized that the whole album was a masterpiece. The song writing, guitar playing, everything!  Van Halen's 'A Different Kind Of Truth' is a refreshing mix of hard rock music that is distinctly Van Halen. Eddie's guitar playing is amazing and in my opinion, has been sorely missed. His guitar tone, I believe, has changed to a different kind of \\"brown sound\\", but with modern equipment. His sound has evolved with the technology that's available to him now. He has the option of using that state-of-the-art equipment to dial in the sound he likes and this album shows that. But in all honesty, I really missed EVH and I'm glad he's back.  David Lee Roth's singing throughout the whole album is spot on. His voice has that youthful, energetic tone that it used to have. No, I don't think he can (consistently) hit those high pitched screams anymore, but it's still DLR. I liked VH when Sammy was in the band and I think they created some outstanding music with him. I also loved the albums with Roth, including this one.  Why do some fans have to be on one side of the fence or the other when assessing Van Halen's front man?  Just listen to the music!  Alex's drum talent is still one of the most underrated in rock history and if Wolfgang was playing bass on this album, then he has certainly earned his place in the band. The drums and bass work together perfectly to bring out the vocals and guitar. I thought I'd miss Michael Anthony's background vocals, but it's not that critical if everything else works, which it does.  So for those who are on the fence about whether or not they want to buy the album; I would suggest you listen to the intro of \\"Outta Space\\" or EVH's solo in \\"Stay Frosty\\". That'll give you a taste of the whole album. As for me, I'm sold and I have no doubt this album will help reinvigorate Rock and Roll!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app &amp; site.  Could hardly  be better. Reading plans are great.  is very easy to use. Includes many useful resources
B0063IH60K|5.0|wow so much fun I could play it forever and ever and is a good easy game for blonds like me! I love it so so much
B00110K62U|5.0|After reading the book Les Miserables, this DVD was breathtakingly enjoyable.  I don't think I would have enjoyed the video without first reading the book.  The second time I watched the video, I activated the subtitle option and found it even more enjoyable.  The package that arrived had two videos disks.  The second DVD had related background material that some may find interesting.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this is a great game to play when you have time. the only problem is that you have to unlock the games.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|The best thing about Thor is South Park made a hilarious parody, also ripping the history channel.  We couldn't tell if Natalie Portman was terrible or if the movie just sucked.  Also no Samuel L.  Lame.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It has a lot of games. Maybe to much. Not addicting. Bored very easy. Very plain and simple not attracting.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|A cute little mahjong game that would be good for children.  simple and fun.  glad that I got it for free!
B006UG90RM|4.0|Rock n roll is back!  Hard hitting drums & bass: check. Guitar hero wizardry: check. Charismatic, fun rock vocals: check. a little light on hooks, but this is what I've been waiting for, a hard rock album that blows away the plastic pop emo crap that passes for music these days.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game. Helps pass the time when I am bored out of my mind. Need more words to get 20.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Could play this game all day and night. Of all of the mahjongg games I have played, this is the only one I need. Great game play, graphics and music.
B0001I55SS|3.0|While The Black Hole seems to endlessly be compared to Star Wars (an unfair comparison placed upon the film solely because The Black Hole is a sci-fi film released within the wake of the insanely popular Star Wars), its roots tend to reach back towards the more cerebral sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Certainly, The Black Hole never reaches the same heights in either popularity or ambition as those other two films; however, there is still something about it that will make you think of it long after you've looked past the film's obvious shortcomings.  The central plot of the film is one that's intriguing and rife with possibility and wonder and it's this set-up that is one of the film's only strong points. The basic premise concerns the exploratory spaceship USS Palomino returning from a deep space voyage, only to be diverted to a nearby black hole. There they find the derelict ship USS Cygnus seemingly defying the gravitational pull of the black hole, but the Cygnus has long been reported lost and the crew of the Palomino decide to investigate. Once aboard the Cygnus, the Palomino crew finds only Dr. Hans Reinhardt (the captain of the Cygnus) and a crew of humanoid, faceless robots operating the ghost ship. Reinhardt is determined (or is that obsessed) with unraveling the secrets of the scientific phenomena known as a black hole and the movie unfolds as his genius begins to border on madness...  From a story standpoint, this concept is intriguing and echoes certain elements of classic literature like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Moby Dick, only set in outer space. While the story is intriguing, its execution leaves something to be desired and I think that's where most people have a problem with the film. Rather than a straightforward sci-fi mystery/exploration, there's a certain amount of Disney-ification to steer the film away from its more heady subject matter and instead focus on the family-friendly aspects like goofy floating robots and fairly unnecessary laser battles. I suppose these scenes were emphasized because no kid was going to sit still long enough while the adult characters wax philosophical about what might happen should someone attempt to enter a black hole, but for the adults, V.I.N.CENT and company get pretty old pretty quickly. Sure, V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B figure out a few plot elements, but it could have just as easily been the human characters. Unfortunately, the robot characters are clearly the target of the critics who view this film as a Star Wars rip-off - V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B. do look pretty similar to R2-D2 and the laser fights they engage in are a less exciting version of what you saw in Star Wars.  Ironically, the action scenes in this film are probably the most tedious part of watching the film. The scenes are pretty devoid of any kind of excitement, seem to ignore some basic rules of science (there's a point where the ship depressurizes, but this seems to have no effect on anybody - they just kind of float passively for a few seconds and that's about it. In actuality, they would be blown out into space and be dead) and they even try to wring out some pathos from the robots. Oddly enough, for me, the more interesting parts of the movie are when the characters are talking about the theories of the black hole (which is almost always seen just outside of the ship through windows, viewscreens, etc., thereby giving the impression that this phenomena is always looming over the characters and should impose a feeling of dread or anticipation) while the rest is just padding nonsense.  There's also another aspect of the story that goes largely ignored and seems to just fit the purpose of being a convenient plot device and that is Kate's ESP with the rest of the crew, including V.I.N.CENT. I have no idea what that's all about and no one really attempts to explain it - it seems to exist solely so Dr. Reinhardt can't monitor all communications between the Palomino crew. I know it may seem silly to pickapart this one minor plot detail (given that there's so many other areas to pick apart), but I guess I just didn't get it. It's one more fantastical element introduced for no other reason than it serves as a deus ex machina. Also, they make a point of mentioning that Kate's father served on the Cygnus, but that story thread never really goes anywhere either. In fact, Kate as a whole doesn't really go anywhere as a character either - it seems like she's set-up to be a central element to the story, but she mostly just devolves into \\"token girl astronaut\\".  The ending of the film is probably what will remind you most of 2001, since it basically reappropriates the starchild sequence from the end of 2001. The ending is largely dialogue-free and doesn't really go out of its way to explain what it is you're seeing exactly. Generally, I like this type of ambiguity because we can't say for certain what would happen should one enter into a black hole, but there's a definite implication of metaphysical properties within this particular black hole and it's all pretty heavy for a Disney film. The ending will probably go right over the kiddies' heads, but the adults will do a double-take and wonder if they really saw what they just saw. When I first saw this film as a kid, I totally didn't get the end. Seeing it as an adult, it makes more sense now and while I can't say it's a completely satisfying ending, it does leave you wondering. It also leaves you thinking that maybe this film was trying to bite off more than it could chew, but the ending fits with the more philosophical side of the film. From what I've read online, it seems as though there were a few different endings to the film: in the novelization, the Palomino crew is basically atomized once they enter the black hole and it's only Kate's ESP that sort of binds their conscious' together, allowing them to survive (in a fashion) - this ending would lend justification and be the payoff to Kate's ESP story thread that I had a problem with earlier. In the comic book adaptation, the Palomino crew survives the trip through the black hole and emerges in an alternate universe with alternate versions of Captain Reinhardt, B.O.B. and Maximilian. Another comic adaptation has the crew emerge in another galaxy (which seems to confirm Reinhardt's theory) and the read-along book has the Cygnus crushed in the black hole while the Palomino crew emerges safely on the other side of it. The DVD special features allude to yet another alternate ending that ends in an even more metaphysical allegory that involves Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. Given all these options, I don't really know if one ending works better than another, but given the one that we got, it works within the context that I think the film was initially trying to strive for, and that is: a more cerebral sci-fi fantasy.  Bottom line: there's a reason that this film isn't more well-known than it is; it's got a lot of faults and it certainly isn't a movie for everybody, but I believe the central idea to be intriguing enough to get you wondering. A lot of people are wondering when this film will get remade and, to be honest, I hope it doesn't. Not that it wouldn't benefit from updated special effects, but I feel that today's generation will emphasize all the wrong aspects of this movie and ignore the more interesting parts. The black hole will exist simply because it's the name of the movie, but the bizarre majesty of it will be downplayed and I can just see a film full of ridiculous robots and lots more pointless action. I can also see this film being injected with a lot more humor and starring someone who can't carry a film; someone like Marky Mark or something. Should that god-awful version ever come to be, perhaps it would have the side-effect of making people reevaluate the original and promote it to \\"classic\\" status.  Personally, I hope this alternate universe with a remake of The Black Hole doesn't exist. If it does, then I'm staying on this side of the black hole and the rest of you can venture in and get crushed by the unrelenting mediocrity.  Just be sure to take V.I.N.CENT with you... I won't miss him at all.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|So I wasn't expecting it to be so awesome. Started playing and now I am addicted! I play this game all the time. It's a lot of fun!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a both challenging and addicting game.  Well worth the price!  It is a great way to pass the time.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I ordered this cover with the Kindle Fire and both arrived the next day. Both products are great and the cover protects the screen and folds into a stand to allow you to operate the Fire without holding it in your hands. The strap allows you to clip a stylus to the Fire if you use one which adds another level of screen protection. Overall the lightweight cover makes the Fire look even more appealing, keeps the screen clean and protected, and gives you many ways to use the Fire. I am very happy with this purchase.

0743298020|5.0|I have just read this book again for about the 5th or 6th time since I purchased it in 2006. With each reading, I enjoy it even more than the last time I read it; it's the only book I've ever read more than twice. I know the plot and the unexpected twist, but it's the author's words that draw me in each time. Each sentence is carefully crafted. There are no \\"boring parts.\\" The ending is not abrupt (which I really dislike), and ties up all loose ends. I find something new each time I read it, there are no wasted words. The Thirteenth Tale is my favorite book. A good wintertime read when the weather is cold and dreary....goes well with a cup of cocoa, a cozy blanket, and a fire in the fireplace.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is pretty fun. I play it oj my kindle fir and I don't get any interruptions by openfient or anything. It's reallly addicting!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great for when your bored and when there is you are on need of something to do. Ive told everyone with a kindle to get it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun twist to mahjong. Love the quest feature, gives you something to work towards, other than just get it done.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm going nuts just to play this game it is Frunze addicting and rad cant wait to play again in a few minutes
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So far it seems really interesting. I like the power tiles to give the game more options. Also, I like the graphics.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game, the story is good and the background is beautiful. And the rewards make it more fun to play.
B006ON41FC|4.0|So many games are just a slight twist on an existing format. This flying game is a refreshing new idea.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|thes are awsome headphones they get loud and have sudiophile sound. i listen to some classical music like william joseph and thes headphones really just bring out the sound it is almost like the music is in your head. some people claim that these headphones dont have enough bass but to me it sounds perfectly level. just like i like it. despite the size of these headphones they are extremely light weight and are so comfortabl you can easily forget about them. another nice feature is that the cord is replaceable. that is extremely helpfull if you are going to pay this much for headphones and are known for breaking headphone cords.. i have noticed that the cord is extremely tough. since i am known for uninteninally abusing headphone cords.
0440244412|5.0|OK, I'm not going to spoil anything in this review for any future readers, because we all hate that.  This is the last installment in Karen Moning's Fever series.  It is an amazing ending to an even more amazing series.  The main character Mac changes drastically as a person in this book, for better or worse, I'll let you be the judge but she grows as a person so much in this series.  Karen is such a great writer, and she knows how to make her characters relate to the readers interests.  It gets even juicier in this book and steamier.  If you've read anything by karen, you know what i mean.  If you like romance or paranormal occurrences, this is a great series for you. Its actually my favorite series and Karen has become my favorite author.
0596805527|4.0|Basically this book is a great book. only point I want to point out is the examples are mostly used math.  It's hard for people who don't know much about math or already forgotten math to understand what the examples really trying to show.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This device is great for projecting the image/sound from your ipad or iphone to your hdmi tv.  You will need to buy an hdmi cord in addition to this adapter to make this work, however they are very inexpensive on amazon.  I bought mine for $2.<br /><br />This adapter will not work on some older ipods.  The first gen ipod touch will not support it, I do believe the 2nd generation does though.  So I'd imagine anything more current than that wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />I love using this for movies or workout videos that I also love to take with me places.  I can easily plug this up to a tv in my apartment gym and do p90x.  I could even use it to watch a movie in the gym if i just wanted to run instead of doing a certain workout.<br /><br />The extra port makes it possible to plug in your wall charger and charge the device you are using at the same time you are using it on your tv.  Very cool product and I don't regret buying it.
1423140591|5.0|OMG!!! I loved the Percy Jackson series, but this.... SO MUCH BETTER! I love this new series and I'm counting the day until the next book comes out. I love the whole thing with Hazel and Sam and Leo and that other guy whose names escapes me at the moment. It's like a square? I guess. I also like the thing with Jason, Piper, and Rena. Then there's this other things with Annabeth that's supposed to happen in the next book. i so totally can't wait.
B004G6009K|5.0|I have to admit, as an adult, I love these digitally animated films!  This is the best one I've seen a good while.  The characters are lovable and humorous, the graphics are beautiful and pleasing to the eye.  Its very enjoyable for people of all ages.  This is a must buy!!  I had to get the blu-ray + digital copy version so I could put it on my iPad and take it everywhere with me!
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is a really fun game. if there were more stars I would fill in more!!!!! I really enjoy this game! plus there are no advertisements! also its only for 99 cents!!! I love cut the rope!!!!
B006ON41FC|4.0|fast fun easy to master with a little practice. Very nice graphics,  a enjoyable distraction for adults and kids alike.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It works very well for me. I use Yahoo mail on the Pc and this works as good. great app
B004RJMUJO|2.0|this game still doesn't have the pomengranate.. thought paying for the app would give it but no same as the free one
B0063TX06I|5.0|Have been wanting to get a CD copy of this album for a long time!!!  Adding to my Bee Gee collection
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It doesn't register my taps in the right location. Instead my taps register by some vertical translation. Please fix this. It seems like there are no mahjong games compatible with 4:3 screens as found on the vizio tablet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so addicting. i love playing this game. and i love how they remodeled the graphics on the Jon page! yayyyy
1455121924|5.0|Awesome book! My sister recommended it and I have been doing gluten free for over a month. My rheumatoid arthritis is now in complete remission and I am off all my awful RA drugs for the first time in 13 years! I now have a waiting list of friends and family who want the book next!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I found it funny when Charlie was describing the ink blots as ink with color dots when he was eager to please. As the story proceeded, I felt sad and moved about how people behave in different situations. The behaviour of people around Charlie reflects general mindset of human beings. This book was different and I liked it.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I had to buy this one to replace the one I had. The disk got worn out. I recommend this movie to anyone.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Entertaining and fun, a great free app of the day for puzzlers and game enthusiasts, don't miss out on this one!
0783225903|5.0|I hadn't re-watched this movie since the first time I saw it, when it came out in 1985. Back then, it had stricken the public with its fatalistic and pessimistic view of an overwhelming bureacracy, a suggested characteristic of fully-centralised power in a controlled society in the future.<br />Today, we can still admire some of its validity and premonitory qualities (and the sarcastic humour !).  The dream-like scenes and symbols used in the film are also ageless.<br /><br />Ever-growing computer systems govern today the relationships we hold with banks, government departments, utilities, phone companies, etc.  Who hasn't experienced the frustration of dealing with their 'machines' and/or incompetent & robotic bureaucrats when problems or errors arise in their service?  'Brazil' will seem so familiar!<br /><br />The omni-presence of screens in our lives, everywhere and incessantly offering us products or services, or used to control our movements and behaviour, is also a well-guessed futuristic scenario by Gilliam & co.<br /><br />And what to say about the 'terrorism' and the 'permanent state of fear' portrayed back then?  Sounds familiar today?<br />I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the threats of an unbridled, arrogant and all-powerful bureaucracy in human society.<br /><br />The film can be a bit 'heavy' at times, though.  Not everyone's cup of tea.<br />Watch it first, before sharing with friends or family.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it makes me think hard hah I'm a Blonde so yeah hah I hope I don't sound dumb lol !

B005Y423ZC|3.0|Here, I'm not really rating Adele's performance or operator's work etc. I'm rather rating the media and its producers. I had to return the first DVD I got, after seeing it not working on 4 different devices - a DVD player, and DVD drives in 3 computers (2 PCs and 1 Mac).  I looked at the surface and I saw some defect there, like internal crack rather than surface scratch. A-ha! I said to myself, and returned it for replacement, to great disappointment of my daughter for whom I bought it.  The second disk I got, before trying, I examined the surface under light, and it looked perfect. So I confidently summoned my daughter for the presentation. Only to see the disk performing the same, being completely unrecognized on some devices and having other ones hang. Can't even describe expression on my daughter's face.  So I got suspicious at that point. I thought: maybe it's simply so over-protected, the older devices can't tolerate it? (The youngest device I tried is almost 2 years old).  To check the theory, I had to hack the disk's protection, and guess what, it worked. What's so ironic here is... I remember, couple decades ago, I had to hack a disk to make a copy for myself because I couldn't afford to buy it but wanted it so badly it hurt. Now all of a sudden I'm forced to do this to a disk I've purchased for its full price; I have to hack it so my daughter can see it. Kids, don't ever be pirates, you'll bring a curse upon yourselves.  Still giving it 3 stars, because after all, the contents itself is high quality as soon as you can get to it. Just beware, you better have a recent player to deal with it.  Am going to upgrade mine and see if the over-protection is not a problem even for newer ones...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the only thing that I am not liking is you have to be on-line to play. That is why I play my other games.
0316044695|5.0|Lone Survivor is a riveting account of Operation Redwing. The authors do a fantastic job of detailing the events and depicting the story of some real American heroes. I would highly recommend this book.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Why must devs put ads on a paid app?  The app is also slow and laggy.  Download Random Mahjong instead!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun twist on an already fun game... I always enjoyed playing mahjong, and the leveled play with objectives and a story line makes it even more fun!

1594203334|5.0|If you hope to have, already have kids or work with kids, please read this book. It is a funny, fast read. It's a sad fact that in some communities in America, children are neglected. But in other communities, the opposite is true. Children are over indulged and parents have sacrificed their marriages, health, sanity and well-being to cater to their child's every whim. There is so much basic wisdom here and Drukerman does point out where french parenting is lacking, like their lack of interest in breastfeeding. She doesn't idolize or glorify french parents. She just humorously points out how much American parents worry, compete and obsess over their children. She makes a good point about parent teacher conferences and how French parents do not expect a lot of praise about their child - but American parents crave to hear how brilliant their children are. I'd say the basic premise of this book is that many American parents have wrapped up their identity and self esteem in their kids and this is very unhealthy. It's bad for the kids and bad for the parents. We have to set higher expectations for their respect towards authority and following our rules. But within the boundaries we set, we need to give them lots of space to grow on their own and experience life without us hovering over their every action. And we need to be adults and have our own life and loves and not make our kids the center of the universe.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun, good way to waste some time if your bored. my kids are even hooked on this addictive game
B006UG909U|5.0|While I'm fashionably late to the review party of Van Halen's latest CD, A Different Kind of Truth, it has come with certain advantages.  One of those advantages has been to eavesdrop on the various alleged controversies surrounding the band line-up and the songs on the album.<br /><br />There are various Van Halen fan camps (\\"One day, at fan camp . . .\\" never mind, it wouldn't be that funny) and all of them have chimed in as to the pros and cons of the current line-up.  It's fair to say that, when a band has been around as long as Van Halen has with all of its various incarnations, the fan base will be divided and there's nothing that can be done about that.<br /><br />What I find interesting, though, is that, after the various fan camps of finished duking it out with each other, they all seem to turn their sites on the album.  Big numbers from each camp seem to be a tad upset that the songs sound like old Van Halen work.  Do they think for one minute that they would be happy hearing anything not even remotely family to the Van Halen sound?<br /><br />I think not.<br /><br />I don't find myself in any of those camps.  I like the album.  It's good.  It's got the signature David Lee Roth lyrical hooks that often leave me smiling (\\" . . . when was the last time you did something for the first time . . .\\").  Eddie's guitar work is as good as ever as is Alex's pounding of the skins.  Wolfie's work as bassist for the band is maturing and he holds his own.  Would I prefer to still see Michael Anthony in that role? Of course.  But it's not my band and Wolfie is not detracting from the band's sound so I can't - or won't - complain.  I just hope the kid learns from the mistakes of his dad and keeps his nose and liver clean.<br /><br />While great tunes, all, the Boomerocity favorites are:<br /><br />Tattoo: Tight harmonies and incredible melodic and lyrical hooks that instantly create an enjoyable earworm.<br /><br />You and Your Blues: Lyrically brilliant, Van Halen/Roth does a great job of referencing lines from great blues tunes to create a great \\"ain't gonna bring me down\\" break-up song.<br /><br />The Trouble With Never: Fun song, great sound, and thought provoking lyrics ( \\" . . . last time you turned on your stereo, did it return the favor?\\").<br /><br />This is a great album.  Familiar sound? Yeah, but it delivers a different kind of truth so why not buy it?<br /><br />Boomerocity.comgreat \\"ain't gonna bring me down\\" break-up song.

B007AQIZNG|5.0|When this show goes off I wont have ANYTHING to watch! Ok maybe reruns! I sure do like how the stories have unfolded this season! I cant wait to see where its gonna go! And boy Dean Sure makes PRETTY babies! i want one! lol  Red
B0067Q42BY|5.0|excellent graphics and gameplay is intuitive. difficulty level is spot on. definitely worth a look for making snobs and noons alike
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Good quality works well you don't get much but it does the job well.There is cheaper stuff out there but i wouldn't trust that garbage.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I would recommend this game as a fun time filler. It has different modes. to keep you amused and playing. I would agree with what others have posted in that the in game ads are annoying but not overly so. continuous play would be better then having to reset tiles, Backgrounds, etc. I only gave it 4 stars because it was too easy. too many &quot;cheats &quot; per level that were hard to ignore. I would not pay 4.99 for this game and I am glad it was free!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's not really any different than other mahjong games but still fun.  There is a story line to it also.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Its ok bug some of the games are boring and doesn't make time go away. :(  yea and the game
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Wow there has been a lot of bad reviews about the free app. of the day mahjong artifacts works wonderfully on my kindle fire I'm glad I downloaded it instead of listening to all the bad reviews yea there are ads at first showing all there other games but its not really ads its just part of the main screen all you have to do is hit play and u do just that, you start the game and I have not saw any more ads.  If u like this kind of game go ahead download it it is worth the effort of downloading heck its a 4.99 game for free on the free app a day, you really should not complain.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think this marvolous game has inspired me. this wonderful game has brought adventure and a smile to my face. thank you.
0385335997|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />What. A. Ride.<br />This was a re-read for me. I think I've read Voyager about four times now but I've never reviewed before. So this is my first time with pen to paper (so to speak) on my thoughts of Voyager.<br />Outlander (book 1) will always have that special place in my heart as being one of my all time favourite books. After all that is the book that started it all and was my introduction to Jamie and Claire's world. However out of the Outlander books, I think Voyager is my favourite of the series.  Voyager is one adventure after another and just when you think your palms can be dry for a second, something else happens. As I said at the beginning, what a ride.<br /><br />There is this one little line in Voyager that perfectly outlines Jamie and Claire for me. It gives me the biggest grin every single time I read it.<br /><br />\\"Damn ye, woman! Will ye never do as you're told?\\"<br />\\"Probably not,\\" I said meekly.<br /><br />One of the reasons I adore Claire is that she is so amazingly smart, clever and has unbreakable loyalty to Jamie. However, there are times where even I want to ring her neck. I think Voyager had me wanting to ring her neck a few times. I completely understood every single decision she made, but it I still could not understand why she went through with them. Now tell me, does that sentence even make sense?? I was even arguing with myself. Ha! Having said that, what a boring book it would be if Claire wasn't Claire. I simply just adore her.<br /><br />There are not enough words to capture my love of Jamie. He is sensible, calm, brave and not shy about his devotion to Claire. The man is the package. Oh he has his flaws, but those imperfections actually perfect him. The thing is, I am seriously smitten with Jamie but I love him to be with Claire. They are my fiction super couple.<br /><br />Voyager takes us on a journey starting at present day Scotland through to 1746 Edinburgh and then on to Lallybrook (sigh, oh Lallybrook), off to Paris, aboard a ship to the West Indies, Jamaica & other various tropical islands to the final exciting resting stop on a wee bit of a cliffhanger at the end of Voyager. Which is why although I have read the series many times over, I'm off to start Drums of Autumn.<br /><br />Although I dont' think Voyager is the most emotional book of the series, my heart experienced heaviness quite a few times. I had a lump in my throat here:<br /><br />\\"He gave you to me,\\" she said, so low I could hardly hear her. \\"Now I have to give you back to him, Mama.\\"<br />and here:<br /><br />\\"It isn't Geordie,\\" I said. My voice was higher than usual. \\"It's me,\\" I said. \\"Claire\\"<br /><br />...and I can't quite put to words what I was experiencing with the acts of of the English soldiers following Culloden, the outrage with Frank wanting to take Bree from Claire, my mouth dropped open when Jamie was flogged again in prison, the nervousness of when Jamie was hiding in closet right after Ian was born. At this point in the book I am not even half way. I haven't even touched on the kidnapping of Ian or the shock of a certain wedding. A super duper rollar coaster I tell you. A true voyage of emotions.<br /><br />It wasn't all sad and distraught by no means. Just the sheer fact of Jamie and Claire's reunion and togetherness was paralleled above and beyond anything bad that could happen.  There were some extreme highs too. *grins*<br />\\"I must have ye, or die.\\"<br /><br />I was not expecting one of the return of a certain character from Outlander nor do I wish to spoil if you are first time reader. Blew_me_ away. Even knowing it is coming, it still does not contain my feelings.<br /><br />Voyager is not a stand alone book. I would not recommend anyone reading it before Outlander or Dragonfly in Amber.  I would recommend if you haven't read the books, you get going and start. They are not light reads. They are not romances. They are emotional roller coaster rides that will never let you forget the characters Jamie, Claire and the country, Scotland. I think Diana Gabaldon should get some sort of shares for how many visitors a year Scotland receives due to this series.<br />So tell me, have you read any of the books? Have I made you slightly curious?many visitors a year Scotland receives due to this series.  So tell me, have you read any of the books? Have I made you slightly curious?

B0067LY4WG|5.0|I am guessing many reviews will applaud this latest Cohen. Mine, too! What I like about Old Ideas is that LC has taken old themes of his music -- love, relationships, pain, spirit -- and with his words and voice, gone down new paths of exploration. His vocal approach is soft, backed by his wonderful singers, gentle instrumentation, and overall flowing rises and falls in rhythms. I love each song, but my favorite is Different Sides, a look at relationships and couples conflicts (\\"But frankly, I don't like your tone\\").  One of my musical peeves is that some of the icons of music rest on earlier visions, and don't keep growing. LC has proven once again that he is an explorer and keeps pushing the proverbial envelope. Way to go, Leonard! If we are not growing, we are dying.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is the best app I have downloaded and that means a lot because I have downloaded about 100 apps if you are looking for something funny me and my friends love it
B006UG90RM|4.0|.....but not too great either.<br /><br />I have given this disc two listens as of my review. I'm having a hard time getting into it and I don't know why. I read many reviews on here and elsewhere that were mostly positive, so I expected more. None of these songs stand out so far.<br /><br />Maybe it's the fact that the guys are older (as are we) and that one can't always capture the past as we wish one could.<br /><br />But hey, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or ears in this case.<br /><br />Not a bad effort by the boys, just not what I was expecting. Hopefully, these new songs will grow on me in the future.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|l like this game. easy to follow and well thought out mahjong can be frustrating at times this version is not
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games a lot of games so much fun my favorite part is that all of the multiple games are fun and also free!!!
B0041KKYGU|2.0|We don't need any more bad teachers, not even goodlooking ones. There are a few moments here that are funny but not many. Lucy Punch, looking far more beautiful, smart, and sexy than Cameron Diaz, as well as being a much better actress, is the star of the show. I want to see more of her everywhere.
B004OC07F8|5.0|I used this book for a strategy course I was teaching and it worked great. It provides an innovative perspective on strategy compared to traditional books on the subject. Although it was writen by academics, it is easy to read and the concepts are applicable to the \\"real world.\\"
B0067Q42BY|1.0|beautiful to look at,deadly to play...this game has been changed up too much to really be considered mahjong.  Avoid it if you just like playing a soothing game of mahjong, and look elsewhere!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Best Mahjong game yet.  Story to bring you on the journey.  Goals to reach instead of always just racing against time like other Mahjong games I have experienced.
B000002VMD|1.0|Enough said.  Lousy singer, terrible songs, vile lifestyle, overhyped nonsense.  This is probably her worst album.  Those who really want to hear a hot singer should look into the sublime Rebecca Black, whose \\"Friday\\" may well be the best music ever written since Beethoven, with brilliant lyrics to boot.  Whitney fans should grow up and face the future.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|has adds but if u turn off wifi while playing games they don't show up, its the free app of the day, its free ans yet evveryone rates it w one star based on ads, rate the game performance not ads or such things, its free ne way

0375842209|5.0|I do not know what combination of gift, skill, work and perseverance go into writing a book like The Book Thief; the product seems like a sort of miraculous expression of reality in a historical narrative of fiction.  I know that seems like hyperbole, but that is my reaction to a book that I had thought was a \\"teen\\" book. Zusak's writing is mature, deep and creative.<br /><br />The Book Thief takes readers to the world of Nazi Germany during WWII and a perspective that I had not seen before. On a poor German Street, families seek to survive poverty, hunger, their own country and a foreign enemy.<br /><br />Narrated from the point of view of Death, the story develops endearing characters facing tragedies with hopefulness.  Zusak adeptly creates his world and characters that I think would grip any readers and rend their hearts.<br /><br />The Book Thief shows that even in the midst of man's most cruel ventures exists man's most loving risks and expressions.  I recommend this book for any adult readers.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|The service and shipping was fast and The item arrived in a timely fashion. I have not used it as yet, so am unable to evaluate it. However The sellers information packet neglects to mention that it is compatible with Linux. I had to track down that information elsewhere. the firmware is Linux based according to Information I got from a Linux users forum.. So it should be compatible with NOAA raster charts.

B001N44BVQ|4.0|I have become an admirer of Scott's work since Kingdom of heaven, and this movie is very good too.  The thing I like about Scott is that he doesn't seem to take sides, there is no judgement against any of the characters in his films, he just seems to follow them with his camera.  DiCaprio was good, but I think Crowe was far better.  Say what you like about Russell Crowe, but he is the most interesting actor working today.

B0067Q42BY|3.0|Shouldn't needed to promote other games with this one. Charging 5 bucks for an app that has ads, even for another game by the same dev is just wrong. The game should speak for itself. If I really liked it, and enjoyed playing it I would have gone searching for other games by the same dev. As it is i'm going to assume all their apps have ads and avoid them entirely. Not the best marketing strategy if you ask me.
B006J420UE|3.0|Pro: AMD's tech support is GREAT when you have problems or questions.  Con: NOTE: These issues may be motherboard related and not APU related - I don't know -  Had trouble running more than one program at a time. When running Alibre (SolidWorks type program), Photoshop, and Adobe PDF reader at the same time using the on board graphics (AMD Radeon HD 6550D) the cursor would \\"skip\\" or \\"Jump\\" about 0.5\\" at a time. Almost impossible to point it at any item on the screen. A CNC milling machine simulator that ran just fine on my 7 year old 1.5 Gb, AMD Athlon 64 (1 core) CPU, Abit motherboard with Nvidia graphics card would freeze the system. (yes, it is certified for Win 7 64 bit OS)  Amazon shipped me a replacement processor (AMD's tech support suggested trying this) with no change in performance so I assume board is the problem. Add on graphics card would probably fix the problem but that would defeat the reason to have chosen this system combo in the first place.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I just finished listening to this book on my iPod - took me a while as I only listen when out walking alone instead of with a friend or working out. But it was GREAT company and also allowed for the stops and starts timed with my exercise.  Tina is super snarky and sarcastic but her hometown girl purity and morals totally take the edge of that. As a city girl born and bred, I actually adore snarky, but her niceness blunts it completely. Her anecdotes and self-depracating humor are a delight.  How great would it be for Tina to be one of my walking or workout companions? I would never be bored.  Continued success to her - her wit and talent are much appreciated.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|If you like PREDATOR, ALIEN, ALIENS, TERMINATOR, BLACKHAWK DOWN, BAND OF BROTHERS, PACIFIC, THE THING with Kurt Russell you will love this movie. If you don't like the SCI FI twist then this may not be for you. Personally, I enjoy the mixing of science fiction with realty type movies. If you like fast paced and non stop action type movies this is for you. This movie combines REALISTIC marine type genre with OUTSTANDING acting, screen play, plot, costumes, special effects etc... No joke here; this is a gutsy, brutal, suspensful, violent and entertaining thriller.
B000G2YD3C|4.0|For all of the progressive rock music fans that might come across this: some of you may well enjoy this release if you enjoy spacey, layered synth work with repeating male and female vocal harmonies, sometimes blended and sometimes not.  If you are looking for some bruising and buzzy guitars look elsewhere, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />There have been some especially good and pointed reviews for this album.  I agree with Murat Batmaz's review concerning how the fourth song is a good overview of what this album is all about.  Also, Lisa \\"Lisa\\" hits the nail on the head when she identifies how this album is built around so much repetition that the songs can easily get lost.  I'm going to chip in my few cents by giving this CD a song-by-song review:<br /><br />1) Aeropause--a promising start to the album.  An instrumental piece that is spacey, dreamy, and unhurried.  It establishes and rests on a simple, repeated motif.<br />2) Goshen's Remains--continuing with track 1's musical motif a pretty, soothing female vocal comes in and settles over this track.  Deeper male vocals join in eventually and there is a lot of vocal layering and harmonizing.<br />3) Apprentice of the Universe--male vocals dominate on this song and there is a strong emphasis on repeating harmonies.<br />4) The Bright Ambassadors of Morning--breaking momentarily from the first three songs, which felt connected, track 4 starts off with outer space noise, cosmic synth pop buzzes, and electronic breezes with ethereal background moans bedding the music.  This just shy of 12\\" song contains several distinct parts, or movements.  After the first 3' conclude drums and some familiar electric background guitars crop up and we come back to the male and female harmonizing that characterizes so much of this disc.  The song then takes a turn for the worse when, at about 4'30\\", the male vocal chants the line of \\"a million bright ambassadors of mo-o-o-orning\\" for a full 1'40\\" (the chanting had gone on for too long at the 40\\" mark)!  Once this movement concludes there is still almost half the song to go and it gets better as it shifts back to a largely instrumental piece of music with a heavy bouncy bass and later bringing the guitar passage back into play.  The vocal chant is brought back into the song at the end but, mercifully, it does not go on as long and so fits better into the song.<br />5) Nimos and Tambos--very similar in style to song 2.<br />6) Voices In Winter/ In the Realms of the Divine--very similar in style to song 3.<br />7) Bullitts Dominae--track 7 differentiates itself by adding more energy by way of speed to the song.  While not overly quick and certainly not a heavy piece of music the musical melody picks up to a swirl and the vocals are excited; they have more punch.<br />8) Arrival/ The Intention Craft--a more prominent and therefore heavier guitar effect distinguishes this track from its beginning.  Another lengthy song that is again broken up into movements.  Especially with their longer songs one can break them down into distinct movements that would be like breaking them down into individual songs that would stand on their own.  I question why the artists chose to meld their songs into one track for the album release?  The sticker affixed to my CD case highlights: \\"INCLUDES: THE INTENTION CRAFT\\".  The Intention Craft is the second movement here in track 8.  If it was meant to be a song unto itself (as perhaps it was released without Arrival?) it would be nice to have it as its own track for purposes of making a mixed or \\"best of\\" CD.<br />9) He Tried To Show Them Magic!/ Ambassadors Return--the album ends with music that moves away from a leisurely pace and picks up in tone and intensity.  It's a decent ending but wouldn't wake you up if you had fallen asleep.  Oh, and lest I forget, that \\"ambassadors\\" chant finds its way back into the CD as part of the fade-out.  As the music fades out there is the hiss of the CD still playing and several minutes of dead air pass before a bonus track concludes the album; the final song is, again, very similar in style and tone to track 3.<br /><br />It is easy to get lost in this CD and not know where you are in it.  It is sometimes dreamy, sometimes hypnotic space rock.  There are some problems with the music (namely problematic repetitions) and I have no idea what they were singing about (some intergalactic space-war with demi-gods? lyrics are printed for those interested) but I liked it.ludes the album; the final song is, again, very similar in style and tone to track 3.

B0067Q42BY|3.0|I'm glad its free today. I wouldn't pay for an app like this but its fun and has a nice new twist. fun and kills time. thanks for making it free for a day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I don't know how they do it in a free app but they have dozens of English translations and paraphrase bibles, plus other languages. It has extra stuff I don't use as well.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This if the best mahjong game I've played. No ads, just a list of dev's other apps on the main screen, not at all offensive, even in a paid app. Great game play. Pinch to zoom, option to show available tiles. Love the quest mode. Got as FAOTD, but would pay for it, it's that much better than other free ones out there. Good job, developer!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I'm not giving this 5 stars cause I haven't played it long enough to unlock many games but from the ones they start you off with which I am already enjoying, I can forsee enjoying it as a great pass time. I'd say its mostly kid friendly as d games aren't some high tech graffics, but if you just wanna kill some time n have a lil fun. Seems perfect...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am amazed at what this app can do.  I was looking for an app that could do multi tasking between work, home and my Kindle Fire.  Both downloads, my Kindle Fire and the PC version, allowed me to sync and view on both. Still learning, was able to record on the PC Evernote and play recordings back on my Fire.  Also placed several internet research pages into the 'notebook'.  After creating a free sign-on with Evernote, I can now sign in and connect at work.  In short, this app lets me take the Kindle Fire to the next working level.  Looking for voice recognition in the near future for the KF.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I bought this because I wanted to have all the books in one collection, but for me it was impractical because with the TOC is very difficult to locate something from certain book and this version doesn't have the GREAT X-RAY feature for the Kindle.  I returned this and bought the individual books, they are more expensive, but for me the X-RAY feature was worth it and to access any part of the book with the TOC is also very good for these kind of books.

0439023491|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the 2nd book.  I've read lots of negative comments about Katniss being whiney, weak, annoying, etc...  I don't find that to be true.  I think Katniss is a strong female character, and I don't think there's a love triangle here like so many have stated.  She says time and again that she never wants to marry and have children.  She's not leading Peeta along and was very honest with him about her intentions.  Yes, she has feelings for Gale.  Yes, she has feelings for Peeta, but I don't think that's the central theme of this book at all.  Peeta is someone she genuinely cares about, as a person.<br /><br />I think she's a strong, capable young woman.  The complete opposite of Bella in Twilight.<br /><br />I read this book in a day and the pace was fast, and had some interesting twists and turns.  Although I've heard mostly negatives about the last book, I'm still looking forward to reading it and seeing how this trilogy concludes.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is sort of a large file, but worth the space.  This is the best Mahjong Tile game I have.played. Lot's of options. I deleted less used apps to keep this on my Kindle Fire. It's a keeper.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Especially like the choice of deal types to control difficulty level. Settings options are many and useful, esp. tap-to-move. Also allows orientation control whereas some other solitaire games do not. Expandability to add games is nice too.
B003ZZAXFO|5.0|It is an album I can hardly ever listen to a few songs and stop, it almost always MUST be listened to from beginning to end...  I can't help myself!  Every song is phenomenal, unique, perfect, and as another reviewer said, \\"haunting\\".  I think I bought this album in 1990 and I've treasured it as one of my top 10 of all-time.  I just wish he'd put out more on SACD.  I can't get one now for less than $100, geesh...  but buy this album if you don't already have it!
031617615X|5.0|This review applies to the Kindle version of the book, purchased through Amazon.  This review contains SPOILERS, so if you don't want to know the ending, don't read it.  I have to admit that I never read the other books; just watched the movies.  I was curious to read the end as I felt that Breaking Dawn 1 didn't end in the right way (Avatar anyone?)  However, curiously, when Bella opens her eyes in the book, it was the exact center of the book.  I was an English teacher and promoted as an attorney because I was the best writer in my government unit.  I did not find the writing terrible, especially as I read the entire book in one night - couldn't put it down.  To me, that is good writing.  I have a sneaky suspicion that I wouldn't have liked the earlier books.  As for \\"fading to black\\", this generation has no appreciation of the power of fade to black.  Who wants to read all the details of someone else's sexual experience.  I think there was plenty of information on the sex as a vampire.  In Stephanie Myer's world, becoming a vampire cures all ills, so why not clumsiness too?  Of course, her world has nothing to do with the traditional vampire and werewolf legends, the one thing about the series that I didn't like.  What the nay saying reviewers didn't like was, in part, what I did like.  I really didn't need to read a full description of a dress.  I have an imagination and like to use it.  The one thing I agree with is the lack of any anger, disappointment or trying to talk an 18 year old out of getting married.  However, as I was married at 19, without too much angst from my parents, it didn't seem as strange to me as it might otherwise have been.  Also, Bella is definitely painted as quite obstinate and her father probably knew it was no use so why ruin her day?  The way Stephanie gushes over how beautiful Bella is when human, the transition to vampire beautiful really isn't all that much - no more zits, discoloration of skin, dark circles under eyes, etc.  I'llbet that vampirism would actually cure a double chin, but Bella didn't have one as a human.  As a woman, I know that there are times I look awful and times I look spectacular.  I suppose if I turned into a Stephanie Myers vampire, it would be the spectacular that showed all the time.  Also, apparently, there is a glow to the sparkly skin she created for her vampires.  I also know that when a woman is graceful, it affects the entire way she looks and is perceived.  So, when turned gets rid of your clumsiness and you before graceful, that affects your look as well.  A lack of specified description of Bella (other than beautiful) lets the reader use his or her imagination.  You younger generation need to learn that sometimes what isn't spelled out is better than seeing or reading every little detail.  Your imagination brain cells have atrophied.  You no longer think imagining is a good thing.  Watch Casablanca - it's in black and white - and see how affective a movie with no screen sex but plenty of passion is.  Now to the final point - everyone gets what they want and no one has to suffer to get it.  Did you not read the part about Bella's suffering that didn't show because of the morphine?  Even the movie tried to pick up on that.  Apparently, Bella suffered quite a bit to become a vampire.  Then she wasn't allowed to see the baby she nearly died for until everyone else said it was ok.  Especially as she is described as the strongest of the clan, if I were Bella, I'd have thrown everyone into walls to hold my own child.  I can't imagine that even Stephanie's newborns would drink the blood of their own children or parents.  Remember, newborns are strong because some human blood remains.  Apparently, in Bella's case, some humanity remained as well.  Perhaps this was because she spent so much time with Carlisle.  How easy did you you think it was for Bella to turn her back on the hikers while hunting?  Part of why she was able to do it was because they might have beensomeone she knew.  If she could do that, do you think that she would want to feed on her own child?  What if someone put your favorite food close enough to you so that you could smell it, but you knew you had to eat tofu.  Could you easily turn from one to the other?  These are subtleties that I think the younger generation just doesn't get.  Vampires are not supposed to get tired, but Bella had to concentrate so hard in training with her shield that she was exhausted (until she actually got it).  Have you ever had to work at something so hard that it gave you a headache or made your body tired?  And, even when she \\"got it\\", how easy do you think it was for Bella to shield an entire army while facing the Volturri?  This is a woman who barely had time to enjoy all the pleasures of her change when she had to abandon them to prepare for a fight?  How easy was that?  Furthermore, all you males and childless females out there, how easy do you think it is for a mother to prepare to send her child away to keep her safe, especially when she had had such a short time to enjoy the child?  These are not being burned at the stake or losing Edward prices she had to pay, but they were difficult, subtle, pains that hurt almost as much.  There was also the pain of thinking Alice was gone for good when Alice was her best friend in the family?  Imagine seeing Rosalie, whom you knew wanted to keep the child as her own, was always allowed to hold the child before Bella could?  Imagine having the greatest sex in the world and the ability to never get physically tired, but you had to stop to take care of your child.  At least at night the child fell asleep so you could go back to sex without feeling you were neglecting her (although the book does describe the mesmerizing feature of Renesmee - that you could watch her sleep for a long long time).  While Bella didn't have to give up Charlie, it's made clear in the book that he would love her no matter what her circumstances were, but justwasn't ready yet to have more than Jacob's transformation ability to deal with.  After all, he had dealt with Edward, Carlisle, and Alice in earlier books.  And he did rebel when he said \\"no more lies\\" because he knew the child wasn't adopted but was Bella's.  OK, it might have been interesting if Renesmee tried her hand on your face communication trick on Charlie, but he might have dropped her.  It is true that Renesmee's understanding of when she could do things and when she couldn't (and why she couldn't have human blood) is a little out there; but then Stephanie's entire concept of the vampire and werewolf world's drives me crazy, especially as the vampire in love with a human and living in a human world was done so much better by the tv series Forever Knight.  If you have never seen this series, rent it or buy it and see how it can be done and still stay true to the real vampire legends.  But if you are going to accept Stephanie's world, which you apparently have if you've read the earlier books, then the final book makes perfect sense.  Without having read the earlier books, my thought is that Stephanie Myers grew as a writer rather than the other way around.  I look forward to seeing how the screenplay incorporates all of the action and subtleties of the end of this book.

0385344228|3.0|Parts of this book just didn't ring true.  If most people's child was in this sort of trouble there would be intense sessions of sitting down with the kid, closely questioning him as to his whereabouts on the day of the killing; directly interrogating him as to his relationship to the murdered child: in this book it's as if the father has just decided, with no input from his son, that his son is innocent and that he isn't going to question him closely no matter what. It's as if there's an emotional hole in their relationship. He acts as though he's tightly connected with his son, so much so that he would be blinded to the possibility that his son could be a murderer, but we don't SEE that, not even once. In fact he doesn't seem to know his son at all. They don't seem to have any kind of connection. (I have teenage sons and yes they can be surly and withdrawn but not all the time)  I also can't believe that a lawyer wouldn't be going over every detail pertaining to the case which includes, first and foremost, questioning his son. Unless he really thought the kid was guilty and didn't want to talk to him at length for fear his son would tell him what he didn't want to hear. But if he thought his son was guilty and wanted to protect him you might imagine he would press the kid even more closely to determine the truth so he could stage the best defense.  So I guess my main complaint with the book is that I didn't buy a relationship with the father; there were few indications that this is a close father son unit. There was a central coldness to their family unit.  When Andy goes to visit his father it has earlier been made clear that a mouth swab had been requested and that the grandfather refused unless his son came to visit. So why would the grandfather be surprised to find out that he has a grandson in trouble? Wouldn't the original request for a mouth swab include that information? Or was it just \\"we need a DNA sample\\" without giving any reason why. To set up the initial dramatic meeting with the two men I suppose.  And would they really drop an investigation of the pedophile once the son was indicted?  And would the mother really spend a session with the psychiatrist describing all of the times in the boys' past when he acted in an anti social way? Clearly she is concerned that her son is guilty at that point. She would more likely share this concern in private with her family first the approaching the issue in such a backwards fashion.  Maybe I missed something but this book left me feeling a little empty. Possibly because there was no one I felt relatable in the book. Partly because there were issues that didn't ring entirely true on an emotional level or on a common sense level.  But it had a lot of good writing and I felt like I knew that community and the types therein. Clearly the author has skills.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So far I really like the game just downloaded. So far no problems. I would say if you like manning you will like this app.
0385344228|3.0|With such great reviews and a story that seemed intriguing, I purchased the book on my Kindle.  I thought the writing was pretty good, although some of the dialogue was not believable.  What ever happened to questioning your son?  If my son was indicted for murder, there would be some long family conversations, like asking my son if he did it.  Also I don't buy that a mother would assume that with some psycho babble form a shrink, that her son is dangerous and can't be trusted.  Did Andy ever tell his wife about the proof he had of Patz's guilt. We never really got to know Andy's wife or child.  I felt let down by Andy's character.  Ended up feeling sorry for poor Jacob - psycho mom and self absorbed Dad.

B0054XOMX4|5.0|The first 4D Beyblade with a 4D Bottom, Phantom Orion clearly changed how stamina types battle.  Face: Orion. This doesn't depict the hunter, but rather a homage to the Orion Nebula, which kind of looks like a face.  Clear Wheel/Energy Ring: Orion. I find the clear wheel pretty small, but just like all 4D Beyblades, it has iron powder fillings in the mold. It helps make a face with the metal frame.  4D Metal Wheel: Phantom. Phantom is just great. It's THE better version of the Burn wheel, consisted of a Metal Frame and a Core.  The metal frame has two sides to it. To make it easier to distinguish, when looking at the metal frame from the side, the one with teeth is the stamina mode; flip it upside down and you get attack mode (don't forget to remove the core). In stamina mode, It has a simple design to it, along with the fangs (and if decals are applied) and clear wheel, it makes a face. In attack mode, the noticeable design is the hexagonal bumps used to attack the opposing Beyblade.  The core is the most interesting piece of the 4D Metal Wheel: it is made of plastic. What does that mean? All the weight of the metal wheel is transferred to the outside perimeter. This acts as a source of centrifugal force; without getting too technical, it basically means it's harder for the Beyblade to stop spinning.  4D Bottom: B:D, or Bearing Drive. The best stamina bottom out there. Why? The bearings inside the B:D allow the bottom part to be free spinning. Notice there are two large holes that are similar to that of WD and EWD. For the aforementioned tips, these act as brakes when hit hard but deplete stamina. In B:D's case, however, the Beyblade does NOT lose any stamina at all, thanks to the bearings.  Overall, this is a must have Beyblade for those wanting a big upper hand with stamina types. Just don't use it in the Hasbro stadiums with ridges on the arena floor. Those hurt the Beyblade's longevity (this thing can spin for up to 7+ minutes!). I also find it hard to screw inthe Face bolt for some reason.

It is so nice to read a well written, proof-read and edited book on Kindle that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Thank you Hugh C. Howey for allowing this book series to be part of Amazon Prime Lending Library.  I look forward to more great works by this author.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Kristine was the best, acting was superb. The stage production and the orchestra was great. The weakest was the Phantom himself. Maybe because Michael Crawford was so good, and no one comes close in singing and in performance. Michael doesn't have the best voice but in Phantom he was second to none. The Blu Ray version is incredible. The encore was a nice surprise, to bad that one of guests could not sing (Don't want to reveal who it was). Highly recommend to have it in your collection.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like to play mahjong a lot, but I really love this game and will suggest it to all my friends.
B006UG90RM|1.0|It would appear VH has been drinking the same KoolAid as Metallica... they too think they can still write good, fresh, inspired new music when they've not since the 90's.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty good. obviously not a four star game, or a five star for that matter, but good enough to be better than a two star game. hence, three stars.
0345440900|5.0|I received this book in time, in an excellent conditions, it is exactly what I wanted. I feel very happy w. my purchase and I recommend it to anybody. Good luck, future moms!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Never even played Mahjong before! Love the quest mode! Well made! Amazon needs more apps like this one! Good stuff!
B001EC3JME|2.0|Edit: After about four months of use, the elastic band loses it's elasticity, and your flashlight will slip through it.  For this, I have reduced my five star rating  down to two due to durability issues.<br /><br />Reading some of the reviews makes me scratch my head.  What part of the description didn't they understand?  I WANT it to fit snuggly around my LED lite. Yes, if I'm in a hurry, it can take two hands to remove/place it in the holder, but this is what I want in a holster. If it falls in/out without any effort, then I would have been greatly disappointed.  The rotation of the holster also give you an extra hand when it's needed most. Being able to \\"aim\\" my lite without using my hands is a godsend.<br /><br />To those that are having difficulty, try leaving your lite in the holster while it's not being worn and it will make removal/placement much easier. Anyone that has ever lost/destroyed a lite when they have bent over to do something and their lite falls out of their shirt pocket will appreciate the snugness of this holster.<br /><br />And the price from Amazon is unbeatable!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a amazing app its easy yo learn and alot of fun. It is definently worth the money. Get this app.
B005TD4GTO|4.0|I'm not sure if Noel meant to do it on purpose for a retro sound or he needs to fire whoever mixed the album. Some of the songs that are busy as far as multiple instruments playing like 'Everybody's on the Run' with the orchestra and keyboards are mixed to sound like it was recorded in the 70's; it's not very dynamic or clear and rides in the midrange like a lousy speaker or recording. I even re-downloaded the songs but still the same. Oh well, it's still my favorite recent discovery. I say 'discovery' because radio sucks these days so you have to go out on the web and search around to find good music!
B005UKJX4E|5.0|There are movies; then there are great movies; then there are almost perfect movies; then there are Terrence Malick movies. AMPAS should just set up a special Oscar called \\"The Most Recent Terrence Malick Motion Picture\\" that Terrence Malick is awarded every year that he releases a new film. I thank my daughter for constantly reminding me to watch the Terrence Malick movies :)

1595827684|5.0|This book has everything an art fan would want from one of their favorite franchises. The book is jammed packed, literally from cover to cover, with tons of concept art. Highly recommended if you like to see the brainstorming processes that went into this universe.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome but it has alot of adds but that's ok because it gives u extra points if u downlowed certain apps
B005K17RU0|5.0|&quot; &quot; everything I just said that is how to delete this app. hold down app and press remove from device
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great app! Nice graphics and gameplay is smooth. Nice story line too. I would definitely encourage anyone who is a fan of mahjong games to purchase this app.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book if you care what our military REALLY goes through, not just the bad publicity they tend to receive on the news. Very gripping stories, had a hard time putting it down. A special thanks to all the military personnel who make our lives possible to be able to sit here comfortably and read books like these.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love most Mahjong games.  This one has great graphics and never gets boring!  It's wonderful that it's the free app of the day!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great app for entertainment on the go.  Would recommend for all who want to try this type of game. Very inexpensive for the hours of fun
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was one of the first apps that I installed on my Kindle Fire after I received it for Christmas. It worked perfectly. But recently it started crashing within 5-10 seconds of launching the app.<br /><br />Today, I decided to uninstall it & then reinstall, but sadly I cannot even download the app now! I just get a message saying, \\"There was an error while downloading AccuWeather for Android. Please try again.\\"<br /><br />Hopefully this is fixed soon, because this was hands down one of the best apps that I had!
B005T87QCI|1.0|this game takes a good 3 hours to download. you have to download in the game and it always says downlaid failed. WASTE OF MONEY I WANT IT BACK.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I wasn't sure at first but once I got used to the controls I couldn't put it down. To navigate through the trees you have to be predictave. Takes just the right amount of concentration. Looks good on my Kindle Fire.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|mahjong is a fun game. if you like puzzle. games I like different shapes to look at. a a a a a
B002GY9F9K|1.0|The tragedy of this series can be laid at the feet of the writers.  While the acting efforts of the cast are commendable, the true essence of Terry Goodkind's book series were totally left out of the show; namely the love story of Kahlan and Richard and how their characters affected those around them. What the fan is left with, is a mangled fantasy universe sparsely populated with original story elements that make you go \\"oh right there it is\\".  The only good thing I have to say about the series? Thank goodness it was cancelled. Don't waste your money buying this and if you are gifting it to someone who is a fan of the books, be prepared to have something better to salvage your friendship after.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|too soon to solicit my review after just two levels, but since you asked, I love it so far. I have never played mah johng, but it's easy to learn at this level.
B006ON41FC|4.0|fun, but wish it was not so repetitive and there was more variety. it would be great if there were more levels.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is awesome its fun, addictive, and exhilarating. one of my favorite things is that the graphics are so good. I just wish they wouldn't use the word nuts for everything. over all great game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game. have. enjoyed. playing. very much. great graphics also. I especially. like that it is free. have always enjoyed this game
B006ON41FC|5.0|very addicting. amazing game. extremely simple premise, similar to shine runner in terms of control. fun acheivements to try n get. turn off wifi to keep open feint off. easy as pie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the app overall and think the point earning unlocking system is cool. I find some of the games far too difficult (like the fish one on page one) but I'm sure they'll hammer that out. Have not many issues with ads, and haven't had any problems with the update but I am not worried. Loved the holiday in game sales!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Love the Help but not a true protrayal of people who worked and had help to care for children and family members who needed assistance.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Really enjoyed app. Its a good game to pass some time. Not to hard to catch on so easy for kids to play as well.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|is this game grate for me it is grate is game is so grate that Sdi can not stop playing this I will criy for this sgame
B006ON41FC|1.0|Every time I want to play this game it asks me to rate the app. Well here you go: 1 star. Hoping this makes the damn message go away.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|I really enjoy a smart movie from time to time (no pun intended).  The premise of this movie was a little different than some of the other \\"we don't grow old in the future\\" movies that I have seen.  It was enjoyable and the Justin Timberlake eye-candy was just an extra treat.
0143119680|5.0|EXCELLENT A fairly long book that fortunately I started on a Saturday because I read the book in two days. I did nothing else but read the book. It is obviously the excellent historical background the author has. I am looking forward to the second and third books. This is the type of book you read and reread. I highly recommend.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This inexpensive case is awesome. I like the functionality and the the price point the best. I am very pleased with this purchase and will definitely consider other amazon basics products in the future.
B001TAFCBC|4.0|I've never really been interested in seeing this movie, quite honestly. After reading some reviews here on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I was really surprised at how good the movie was. The concept is a bit far-fetched, but the emotion and reality of the ups and downs of love's journey held my attention until the end. Love is perfect..but people are not. This movie depicts that truth in a thought-provoking way.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this game for life. I will cried for this game.if you do not grit for this game I will smack you
B0067Q42BY|1.0|The only benefit for the open network sockets permission is so that the developer can annoy you with splash ads for their other products.  That doesn't belong in a $5 app, or ANY paid app.  The reason to pay for an app in the first place is to AVOID those types of annoyances and intrusions.  The developer should have just put a button in a settings menu reading \\"Our other apps,\\" and that would have been fine.  But every time you open the app, you get splash screens for their products before you are permitted to continue.  That's the behavior one would expect from a free, ad-supported app, not a premium $5 product.  Why a developer would shoot himself in the foot by advertising his products this way to those who PAID him a fee is beyond me.  Guess he thought his paying customers would only get angry AFTER they paid, and by then, he wouldn't care.  At least today as the FAOTD, those who wanted to try it out don't have to pay and be scammed by this greed, and they definitely are now alerted as to what to expect in those other paid products he wants you to buy.  Putting up with that tutorial in the app is just adding fuel to the fire.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|fun mahjong game... but ads in a full version of a game is unacceptable.  since this is the faotd, it's fine... But id be ticked if I had payed five dollars.
B005OGYH90|4.0|I'll be the first to admit I was never really a Gun's and Roses fan, I really thought they were overrated as a band, and that Slash was overrated as a guitar player. I've been playing guitar for about 3 years now and really his playing on Appetite and even Use your Illusion wasn't spectacular minus a few solos. Recently, I've given them and Slash another listen and another chance, and my opinions have changed alot. One of the reasons was because of this DVD.   I wanted to give this Live DVD a shot, because even though I thought that Slash's solo album was somewhat unfocused and lackluster, I'm a huge Alter Bridge Fan/Myles Kennedy fan and I wanted to see what Myles would bring to the table being that he would be singing not only the G&R songs but all the songs from the myriad of artists that Slash had on his album (minus Lemmy's song which was sang by the bassist, who did a good job and sang backup) . Not only does Myles handle ALL of the Guns songs very well, he actually MAKES SLASH'S SONGS BETTER than the artists that penned them. The songs, it seems, were quite strong already, but the vocal performance(especially Promise, Chris Cornell's number, and Nothing to say, which was from the singer from Avenged Sevenfold) by Myles really gave the tracks alot of energy, a great deal more than I thought the original artists brought. Where the songs sounded unfocused one after the other on the LP, Myles' voice unifies them and gives continuity. I have this DVD in CD version on my ipod and I regularly listen to them, but not the LP versions sang by the artists that wrote them... thats how bad they sound comparatively to me. Myles did a good job also on the G&R tracks, and even the Slash's snakepit songs... He's no Axl Rose, but Myles actually has a better overall voice, and he does a great impersonation of him.  Most Importantly, SLASH'S PLAYING is actually superb. Wheras when Appetite for Destruction came out, his chops were good (and I could say I was somewhat close to hisplaying ability on that album); they are great now and I'm not even close anymore to his. Whether he's been practicing alot more, or getting clean is given him a clearer head, his playing for the most part is super clean, almost no mistakes in his playing (maybe once or twice if that), and his solos and soloing style if somewhat repetitive if you listen to the album in one sitting, his playing and chops are lightyears ahead of what he used to be and he has some reallly cool ideas in a few of the solos. The camera men do a decent job of showing him playing, though sometimes they don't focus enough on the fretboard and show crowd shots in the middle of a solo. Don't really get why they did that. The Godfather solo and Promise in particular really show how far his playing abilities have grown since he first was in Guns an Roses, and even Velvet Revolver. Also, the setlist really highlights how strong some of the Guns and Roses songs were and how great they still hold up even today (Civil War is a highlight). I know Izzy wrote alot of G&R's biggest songs, so I think I may have unfairly written Slash's abilities to write songs . While I still don't think he's the bet songwriter, the DVD really shows on his solo album songs he has a unique knack for writing riffs and the songs hold up very well, and better than on his LP again because of what I feel is aided  by Myles' performance.  In Conclusion, this isn't a perfect DVD, but the setlist Slash put together was great, and really highlighted the best songs from G&R (no surprise most were from Appetite) as well as the underrated Slash's snakepit; not to mention Slashs solo album. All of the songs really Benefited from Myles' vocals and like I said he makes the Snakepit and Slash album songs better than they were originally. Go figure!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the best note taking app for kindle fire and android phones that you can find on the market.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unsure about reading this book since it is not the type of book I normally like, but I'm so glad I read it!  I absolutely loved it! The whole series is a must read!!  I read all 3 books in just a few days, they were THAT good!
B007AQJBCA|5.0|I look forward to seeing this show every week and they never disappoint me. The action and thrills make me want to bite my nails. Thank you Nikita and Company for doing a great job with the show. I hope your around a LOOOOONG time. Go Nikita!
B0063IH60K|1.0|A full-screen VIDEO commercial for CHARMIN TOILET PAPER when opening the app?  I should never have accepted the recent update!  You would be wise to now UNINSTALL, but first email the developer through the app as to WHY you are doing so.  COMPLETELY AND RIDICULOUSLY UNACCEPTABLE to have movie trailers and commercials in an app!  THIS IS GOING WAAAAAAY TOO FAR!  SCREW THIS!  UNINSTALL!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Amazing, fun, and highly addictive! This game offers so much more than Angry Birds. Instantly you'll catch yourself finding excuses to play. Easy to use controls, and accumulated nuts earn you more rewards.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is a good game. I loved playing this game. I love the little costumes. This is the best game I have on my kindle.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, but I'm not able to highlight and make notes when I read.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|enjoy playing this no issues with the game. all the family can play. I would recommend this for all am playing on kindle fire
B004LWZWBU|5.0|great cast, cute little story, nice movie for any age group.  charming, insprirational, funny.  i guess i have to add some more word.... blah blah...  pretty cool  go out and rent or buy... and enjoy!

B006ON41FC|3.0|when steering left and right the controls seem very sluggish on the fire.  would not buy this game. or recommend it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Love the show, so bought the series. I'm into disc 4 and its the same old Daria i loved. The note about the music changed wasn't a big deal, the show is so old that i couldn't tell what was changed. with all the shows they are bring back it'd be great if they brought by Daria!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|this is a great game but it has ads and every five minutes it says please rate this game and is too easy to win
B006ON41FC|2.0|Too much lag to be playable properly. A top end device shouldn't have so much trouble with this. Open feint also shouldn't be loaded by default.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|it is a awoke game that you should play plus it is the free app of the day for five dollars!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451648537|5.0|A family member handed me this for my birthday, and I felt a little confused at the time.  I really don't know anything about computers, and I only heard of Steve Job's when he sadly died last year.  I read a lot of biographies every year, and I have to say this is one of the most touching I have ever read.  Jobs is a man of several personalities, and not all of them good. In many parts of the book you can almost forgive his failings for the incredible devotion he shows to his work. His insistence on hard work and perfection must have made him feel like a loner at times, as there is no one who can truly understand him.  This is a fantastic book, and it is awe inspiring to see a true entrepreneur make the headlines so many times, when most of them are so focused on B list celebs falling out of nightclubs drunk.  An excellent book about an exceptional man.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this movie but it was very good! It is a very unique movie and I recommend it.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|we waited so long for this new album and it is all I hoped it could be! I am absolutely impressed and very satisfied with the whole album. From the first song which is in Norwegian (I presume, and only wish an english interpretation came with the lyrics so I wouldn't have to translate it myself) to the last, I enjoy it more each time I play it. I LOVE Thuomas' writing & it just gets better. The music is rich, intricate & orchestrated (as we expect from them), the singing is awesome, but I really love the theme & what it has to say... exactly my kind of music! The beautiful yet scary world of dreams, nightmares & the unfulfilled longings of youth and trying to stay young at heart, are represented with the perfect music- from lovely ballads to rocking hooks to an eerie-twisted carnival sound- and lyrics which, to me, seem truly divinely inspired. The only negative I could say about it is -that I wish the one song which was just spoken-word had music with it too/ but perhaps he just didn't think it should & he's the composer... and an awesome one!! I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is fun to play, easy to learn, and  addictive! I would recommend if you want a game that is fun to play !
1933952806|5.0|It is a nice book. Good quality paper with nice illustrations and a ton of information. It is well laid out and relatively compact although it weighs a bit.  To master a significant amount of the information provided in this book requires a bit of effort. You have to use the book with your camera in hand. I often refer to the user's manual in addition to the book when I don't quite understand something. The book is not really a substitute for the user's manual because they compliment each other.  The D7000 has an enormous number of features many of which would be unfamiliar to many users so you need as much information as possible. I would recommend buying several books as you usually can't find everything in one book. If you are more familiar with film cameras such as myself then the D7000 is an eye opener.  This seems to be one of the better books available about he D7000. I would definitely recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this mahjong is fast and responsive giving a player a good feeling about it instead of being slow good game to pass the time with
B0050SYS5A|5.0|It works wonderfully for our small family room.  I was hesitant about buying it after reading the reviews.  Turned out it is easy to install, and works perfectly.  Read the directions!! That will help. It has to be in front of the t.v. between 2 feet to 4.5 feet.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I got the game for my little bro and found myself playing it itz pretty addictive download this app now
B006INDMEE|3.0|The Debt was a well written and well put together movie. Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain were fantastic. The movie was intriguing and suspenseful.  It also had a bit of a love story mixed in. This movie only receives an average rating from me because I found the storyline not all that original, and overall not all that entertaining. I am hard pressed to find a movie that is overly entertaining in this genre though. It just isn't my favorite.
B006ON41FC|5.0|read the above, runs great on my Fire, has OpenFeint, which adds a lot of fun too. Recommended to anyone!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|this app does not work. it doesn't show you what to do!!! it doesn't teach you how to do anything!!!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Fell in love with it in the first chapter. If you have an aversion to flawed characters, go in with an open mind because these guys definitely have their issues! Travis with his alpha-male, co-dependent, and self-destructive behavior and Abby's inability to trust her instincts to lead her to where she wants to be. It's almost joyful to watch them evolve and change and do a little bit of growing up together. An unrestrained and refreshing view of that young, all-consuming love, that we can all remember experiencing at some point. The story is so captivating that you'll be reading at every opportunity (like me at 3am under the sheets on my phone) and will find yourself rooting for this messed up kid to do the right thing for once and get the girl. A new favorite I'll be re-reading, because I don't want the story to end.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun and easy game. My seven year old daughter really loves it too. decent graphics and entertaining. Keep 'em coming.
0439023491|5.0|All I can say is wow. The first book was great but I can say this one was even better. It was just completely non stop. I feel like I am actually there with the characters. I keep going and going glad I can multitask and listen to the audio while doing other things or else I wouldn't of gotten anything done. This is going to be the first time since The Night Angel Trilogy that I am going to complete the series this quickly. I am so glad I started reading after this trilogy is complete or I wouldn't know what to do. Already losing it between the other series I am waiting on. I hate cliffhangers. Def a recommended read
B006VRZ6KA|4.0|I enjoyed What's Your Number? I thought it was quirky, funny, and cute. It was a good romantic comedy that made me laugh and kept me entertained. The cast certainly didn't hurt this movie any either (I enjoy Chris Evans). I would certainly recommend this movie if you are looking for a light romantic comedy.  If you watch this moving going in with extreme high expectations or read too much into it than you will be disappointed. This movie won't be winning any awards and it certainly isn't original and is very predictable. Nonetheless, it is entertaining and fits into the cute light romantic comedy genre.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the Best Zombie T.V series of all time,the only flaw is all the picture sound it is noisy is they could make the picture 1080 HD and smooth it would be flawless art, great story acting and directing, i was surprised didn't expect much when i watched it, but now i cant wait to see were this is heading, i like the fact it is a TV series all zombie movies end and the next movie is always wat different like return of the living dead 1 2 and 3, number 3 was a love story what the hell, anyway enjoy this series as much as i did.  its about time Zombie movies became the norm, iam happy to see great directors making my kind of movie, then making it a TV series.  out of 10, i give it a 8, only because the picture is not 100% if they fixed that i would give it a perfect 10 out of 10,  PS, there is one scene in the first series were a man is trying to shoot his zombie wife and cant do it that scene is powerful both actors made that scene incredible.  \\"A Well Acted out Zombie Series\\" \\"Worth ever cent\\" \\"A must buy for zombie fans\\"
B000QR4WO2|5.0|My friend turned me onto nightwish.  After hearing a couple songs, i started looking around at their different albums and then i stumbled across this live performance on youtube. What i heard was amazing! So i quickly came to amazon and found this album and i can honestly say that i've never owned a more enjoyable,powerful live performance cd.  Tarjas' voice is simply amazing.  The blend of intense rock with her opera voice is an indescribable blend. I had goosebumps more than once listening to this album!  It's a must have cd or its in video as well on dvd and blue ray. The exact same concert.  Pick it up, you won't regret it!
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is an incredibly well produced documentary about one of the best and most unappreciated rock bands in the world. And it is not intended for hardcore Rush fans only.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this all day!! It is fun.. I especiallly like how simple it is to go from a 3 card to a single card dealing when you are out of options. Nice...
0439023513|5.0|As the conclusion to The Hunger Games Trilogy I went in expecting it to be amazing (so glad I waited until the series was completed).  I was not disappointed.  It picks up right where Catching Fire ended. Katniss is going back to District 12 to see the wreckage after Districts 13 rescuing her from The Hunger Games.  As the story progresses it is filled with lots of twist and turns you cannot assume anything because you will be wrong. As I read it shows Katniss being more and more of a pawn still in the games.  First her becoming the official face of the revolution \\"The Mockingjay\\".  After finally agreeing she includes several requests.  Katniss quickly though begins to realize that you truly cannot trust anyone.  The first turn I noticed is when she sees Peeta for the first time on television him protecting her until he is no longer in his right mind.  Watching her battle with this and asking for immunity for him and the others.  It though gets more touching when she sees him for the first time after he is rescued and he tries to kill her (big shocker).  As they progress though and she finds he had been brainwashed by the capital using jabberjay venom which makes her evil in his mind.  You are starting to slowly see her growing more and more in love with Peeta though and less for Gale.  At first she tries to write him off and go into Gale's arms but she never felt the same way.  The biggest hint though more then her not being able to get him out of the mind is the Pearl.  That Pearl she constantly keeps with her.  After Katniss is approved to be a solder she gets put on a squad that pretty much is just for show.  There she is with Finnick, Gale, Boggs, and several others.  They pretty much are used to shoot propaganda videos.  When they do get put into action President Coin decides to surprise everyone by putting Peeta in the unit (still battling with inner demons)  Coin is doing this in hopes that one or both will kill each other.  As the story progresses they slowly make there way to the capital so Katniss can assassinate President Snow (she exaggerated their orders).  As she makes her way there Rebels begin taking over the streets.  Many people die and she gets separated from her team. Eventually one of the most heart wrenching parts of the story occurs her sister gets caught in a bomb and dies.  This is when the Rebels claim final victory.  Katniss injured yet again wakes up ready to assassinate Snow.  But before they do the public assassination Coin calls the few remaining victors from the Games and ask if they should put on a capital edition of the Games.  Which causes lots of fighting but they agree they should.  Katniss ends up some how in Snow's prison and they talk.  He states he is bad but he didnt order the childrens death.  This makes Katniss think and when she goes to shoot the arrow at Snow instead shoots Coin.  All in all after this the story seems rushed.  The ending happens Gale goes to district 2 Katniss, Haymmitch and Peeta ( a few months later) return to 12.  Kaniss marries Peeta have kids. The End.  Just wish it had more at the end.  That is the reason for the 4ly make there way to the capital so Katniss can assassinate President Snow (she exaggerated their orders).

B004EPYZSK|4.0|When I first saw the trailer of this movie on TV, Joss Whedon of Firefly fame came to mind.<br />You know, the whole outer space cowboy thing.<br />I wonder if Spielberg or any one else has put this together????<br />It's a good watch as stated by so many other reviewers and does require an open mind, just like Firefly did.<br />Maybe that is why the same people that did not get Firefly, also did not get this movie.<br />For some reason, the movie did seem a bit bumpy and slow as it just didn't flow as well as it could have.  This is the directors job.  Also, I think its time for Ford to put his saddle away; I love his work, but there comes a time when everyone has to admit going to the last roundup.

B003KRJNBW|1.0|This movie was so bad. All that for the bible...how utterly stupid.  And then at the end when it turns out that he is blind.....that is the stupidest thing ever. To walk so perfectly, go where he did, walk right into stores, right up to bar, fight like he did and not fall off the bridge-and it turns out he's blind????? are you freaking kidding me. And all that to save the bible???  This gets added to my list as one of the worst movies ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it there so much games plus it so fun and there not the same games you play all the time
0440244412|5.0|All i can say is NOTHING IS WHAT I THOUGHT.  The closest could was only a thought not a solid one at that.  Who killed Alina, what is Mac, what is Barrons just a few of the many questions answered in ShadowFever.  It was awesomely told keep you on your toes the whole ride.  Before the end of the series concludes you will have tons of theories shattered even some from the beginning of just this book.  I will definitely recommend this series to anyone who is into the paranormal.<br /><br />A++++++

B005UKK4Y2|3.0|Let's be honest, most people will watch this just to see Jennifer Aniston acting like a nympho. The rest of the move is in the typical 'men acting stupidly' variety. There are a few funny bits, but for the most part the movie is unmemorable.

0545425115|5.0|This book was a big surprise.  I honestly going into it did not think I would enjoy it.  Usually big time hype books I am not a fan of (Twilight) but this one I absolutely loved. The more I read the more and more I got into the characters the more i felt I knew them.  During the first books of the series usually I still am missing a lot of the characters but this book I truly had an understanding.  Katniss how she is so strong yet so vulnerable and naive.  Peta with his is he \\"real\\" or \\"fake\\" towards Katniss.  I found myself laughing and times and am not ashamed to say even a little teary at times one scene really got me (if you have read it you know which one it is). Cannot wait to finish book 2.  (Trying so hard to not cheat on wiki)
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Here's what I want from entertainment...I want to be transported to another time, another world. This series does that in spades. You will be captivated by the late Andy Whitfield's performance as Spartacus...he inhabits this character so completely it's hard to think of anyone else portraying him. I don't know why some say this is a 'guy's' series, it simply isn't. As a female I was enthralled by the intrigues, politics and emotions. It is visually stunning, written to grab hold of you and is relentless in its depiction of the brutality of the era.<br />On the sad note of Mr Whitfield's demise, I just can't believe we've lost such a gifted actor as well as a genuinely great person, he's sorely missed<br />The DVDs do not have a blooper reel but the commentaries are bittersweet listening to Mr Whitfield discuss season two...so sad

B0051MKNV8|5.0|When my husband brought this movie home he had to talk me into watching it.  Once I watched it I was hooked.  I love the thought of the possibility of a drug that can make someone use every part of their brain.  I have recommended this movie to numerous people who all enjoyed it immensely.  Overall this is one of my favorite movies!!!!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I thought that it would require moving my kindle but no and it is hard to steer but other than that its fine
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the storyline of the game is fun and the graphics are fantastic! just like the game you played as a kid on the computer, only much better! The designer did a good job! well worth the free download today!

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Oh Fifty! Why oh why did you have to come to an end? I will miss you so much but since you are safely stored on my Kindle, I may have to revisit you often. I loved this whole series and Freed was a wonderful conclusion to it all. Ms. James sent me on a roller coaster ride with this one and I came out smiling with my inner goddess taking notes the whole way.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies that I have ever seen.  One of the reasons is that I worked in the high desert of CA, actually in the Mojave desert, as a math teacher, so I am familiar with the dynamics of small town society in the Mojave.  (Though granted, I was pretty close to civilization).<br /><br />The introduction threw me off a little bit and seemed a little too artsy for my taste, but it made sense in light of the rest of the film, that plays on Rango as more or less a wimp who is forced to act the part of a tough and courageous and wily local town sheriff.<br /><br />But the artistry, grace, attention to detail, and dialogue are what make this movie unforgettable.  The scene where he hiccups the flaming cactus juice into the face of the bully, who then responds with a simple offer of a gun for a life-threatening duel was priceless. I also loved the part where he walks into the bar and the music immediately stops and there is enormous tension, as the small desert rabbit asks \\"Who are you?\\"  And the scene where they are looking for the water pipe and he says some kind of theatrical and pompous verbiage where the other people in his posse claim that \\"I think he said 'follow the pipe'.\\"  was also quite excellent.<br /><br />But the confrontation between him and the legendary Rattlesnake Jake was the highlight of the film and superbly done.  I find it difficult for anyone to reasonably give the film less than four stars out of five after watching that.

B005FITIIC|5.0|MOVIE RATING:  5 stars (A)<br /><br />Just like the 2008 stock market crash, Margin Call (2011) seemingly came out of nowhere and surprised the hell out of me. When I first saw the trailer, this movie got on my radar and I anxiously awaited it's release. To my surprise, it ended up surpassing all of my other highly anticipated films from the Fall of 2011. This is simply one of the best films of 2011...or any year.<br /><br />Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, Margin Call is a stunning feature film debut. Chandor's screenplay is so sharply and intelligently written, that I immediately compared this film to Oscar winning scribe Aaron Sorkin's super smart The Social Network (2010). This movie is just as current, as relevant, and as snappy as that highly regarded film. I love both movies. They're both perfect in my eyes. Margin Call is the better \\"sequel\\" to the classic financial thriller Wall Street (1987). While I really like Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), Margin Call is a much better look at the current mindset of the moneymakers in today's stock market, as well as our overall culture.<br /><br />For many people, this movie won't appeal to them. It demands you to use your brain and look at the darker realities and motivations of investment banks and the people who work in that world. But for those willing to go on the Margin Call ride, and escape into it's point of view, it's a real thriller. I was on the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie. It just zipped along and kept me fascinated to see what would happen next, even though I intuitively knew where it was gonna ultimately go. But the ensemble cast is so richly fleshed out in each of their roles, that all of the little details of this film had me. Having watched the movie 4 or 5 times now, I keep going back to it over and over because it holds my attention each time.<br /><br />Ensemble movies like Margin Call live or die with the chemistry and performances of their cast. Fortunately, Chandor has picked a brilliant cast that really came through here. It could be easy for each of these great actors to get lost in the overall story, but each and every single one of them sizzles in their few minutes on screen. There's not really a single protagonist or a single antagonist in this movie. And that's the whole point of the story. It's not black & white. One could argue that Kevin Spacey is the lead actor, but the same argument could be applied to Zachary Quinto. The story is told through the eyes of both, and they both bring some of their best work to it. Supporting actors Paul Bettany, Simon Baker, Jeremy Irons, Penn Badgley, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci each bring fantastic supporting performances, embodying their characters perfectly in my mind. To a degree, they're all criminals and victims in the financial mess that they've created and participated in. And aren't we all really the same, in our own lives? The cause and cure of our successes and failures in life?<br /><br />The production values in Margin Call far outweigh the reported $3.4 million budget that it was made for. Chandor assembled a fantastic team that really brought their A-game to this project. Shot mostly on a Red One digital cinema camera, along with some footage shot on a Canon 5D and 35mm film, the cinematography by Frank G. DeMarco is beautifully saturated, well composed, and presents New York City as well as any film before it. I highly recommend you watch this movie on blu-ray to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />While the production design by John Paino might get overlooked, every detail of this claustrophobic movie is well executed. Supposedly, the interior building scenes were all shot on a single floor of this building, so the production design team did a great job reallocating space to serve multiple functions.<br /><br />Two of the most important aspects of this film are the music and the editing. They go hand in hand, like on most movies. Editor Pete Beaudreau cut this featuredown to the bone, leaving just enough material to tell the story in an interesting way, but not too much to weigh it down. The tone and pace are spot on. The original music score by Nathan Larson is reminiscent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' superb work on The Social Network. It has a buzzing, clicking and edgy beat to it, helping push forward the dialogue and ideas presented by the cast. It really brings an emotional core to the film that might not otherwise come through. It's a subtle emotional core, but there nonetheless. I also really enjoyed the vocal piece \\"Wolves\\" by Phosphorescent. It leant the perfect tone to the scene where actor Zachary Quinto discovers the problem with the complex financial equation.<br /><br />At its core, Margin Call is a small, handcrafted indie film catered to a niche audience. It does it's job perfectly. And if you're willing to get into this story and relate to the characters, I think you'll find the payoff that we all look for from our investments in movies.interesting way, but not too much to weigh it down.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|This is my first Kindle so i had no experience with what i needed for accessories. I ordered this cover from Amazon because the price seemed ok and the video of the guy twisting and banging on the case and then showing how it worked as a stand was impressive.  Yes, i am easily entertained.    I got the cover and it was a good looking, very lightweight, tough case. The Kindle fits very snug. The appearance was better than i expected.    Then i used it for a few days and felt ripped off. The stupid stand feature is a joke. The groove is too shallow to work properly, the Kindle is barely balanced and a gust of breath will make it fall down like a house of stacked cards. I find i hover a couple of fingers by it to catch it when it collapses.    And another realization after using it a few times, the front cover that folds back into a stand ends up resting on the table top with the soft inside now acting as the outside on the table. So when you close it back up, any syrup or dirt that the Kindle may have rested on is now pasted on the soft inside of the cover that rests against the screen when closed. Not the definition of a protective cover.    Now i hover protectively over the impending collapse of the Kindle and constantly scan the table surface for attacking debris all while trying to enjoy using it.
B000002WMH|5.0|First I'd just like to say that Elvis is the greatest entertainer to grace the stage. Next there will be no other like him ever as cliche as it sounds but he is the Original and every one else are just carbon copies.No on with the review.I love this boxset. This set has every single song recorded during the 50's which in my humble opinion is the definative era of Elvis. In this set you will hear the evolution of rock, punk, metal, psychobilly, and so many more genres in these 5 discs. Most will say how do you get all these extreme genres from this shy young man from Tupelo? I will give examples.  Metal- Look no further than Heartbreak Hotel with its instrumentation and arrangment as well as the guitar solos are precursers to todays heavy metal arrangements.  Another example is Trouble from the King Creole soundtrack. With its rather rough for the time lyrics \\"I'm Evil as can Be so don't mess around with me\\" \\"if you gonna start a rumble dont you try it all alone\\" along with the tempo and big horns lays the foundation for some heavy predecessors such as Danzig who later covered this song with modern sounds and the same attitude.  Pschobilly- We find the early recordings without drums to be the foundation for this sub genre songs like \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" \\" Lets have a Party\\" \\"Lets Play house\\" these songs show that if sped up and given a distorted guitar you would have acts like Tiger Army, the Nekromantix, and other bands along those lines.  Punk- Many of Elvis' songs had attitude and subject matter that would show that he was one of the first to bring it to the industry. Songs Like \\"You're so Square Baby I Don't Care\\" and \\"His Latest Flame\\" prove to have a very punk attitude in the Latest Flames case the girl is two timing the best friend and he knows but dont say nothing. wow.  There are many great songs on here that will just get you in the mood to dance and have a good time. There are songs that will make you want to make love to your wife and songs that will make youwant to cry like \\"My happiness\\" which is the very first song Elvis recorded at Sun Records.  All the Classics are here as well as some odd numbers which you might not have known of if you are a casual listener. This box is Elvis at his most stripped down which is a great thing because his voice is able to shine on most of the tracks. We see that Elvis was capable of a big vocal range not just the stereotype he is known for which is the low tone. On this you will hear the highs lows and mid tones of his great voice. This is the Elvis before the extra stuff was added this is the guitar bass piano and drums and some times just guitar bass and drums and sometimes just guitars and bass but always with that powerful voice.  This brings me to the band of Elvis: Bill Black-Bass, Scotty Moore-guitar, and DJ Fontana-drums. Thses men are the rhythem section that helped Elvis become the Legend that he is today. These men set a standard in the instruments that they hold. Scotty Moore's guitar playing was fluid, unpredictable, and innovative just listen to \\"Too Much\\" \\"Shake Rattle and Roll\\" and hear him manipulate the original sax parts to astounding guitar leads. Bill Black bring an original slap style to the bass that no one was doing at the time and DJ Fontana adds weight and accent to many songs.  All in all this is a slice of Rock history at your fingertips and its like a buffet for your ears. I see this as the very roots of all sub genres of rock. If you have a trained ear you can hear the parralells and see where many bands got their arrangements from. Buy it because you will see the magic of Elvis at his rawest and most unpolished and most stripped down sound before the suits before the drug addiction and before the orchestra backing him. This is Elvis at his absoulute very best.  Thank you Elvis has left the building.

0241953391|5.0|This cookbook is most definitely the best cookbook/technique book I have ever had the pleasure of using.  I bought it as a Valentine's day gift to my husband who also enjoys cooking.  We have had a ball in the kitchen learning how to make fluffy  omelettes, silky sauces and succulent meat dishes.  I am amazed at how a minimal amount of effort, some time and some attention to technique and detail can produce such delicious food.  I have taken inexpensive cuts of beef, pork and chicken and turned them into culinary delights.  My husband and I are not novice cooks however, I cannot take any real credit for these amazing results aside from having the good sense to purchase this book and follow the directions.  I can't wait to get my hands on Vol. II.
B002BWP49C|5.0|First let me start off by saying that I am a twilight book fan and up until this point have been very unimpressed by the movies themselves, I suppose mainly it's because books to movies usually come out really crappy.. The first three did not do the books justice even though I did somewhat enjoy them when not trying to find ways to criticize them for leaving out key details that should have been included (book hounds may agree on this).. I of course own all three as I own every movie based on any book I love but unlike it's Predecessors this one hits it hard and by that I mean really really good, I couldn't express how good without ruining anything for those who have not seen it or read the books but it's definitely something to sink your teeth into if you know what I mean ;)!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this just because they were breaking it into two parts which was something I wish all of them could have done but if they were to choose one title to do two parts I'm really glad they chose this one.. This story would have been impossible to do in one film without hacking the book into pieces while in the process so I will love to put my stamp on this with a 5 star review! Actually I like the other movies somewhat better just because of the effort on part one of this (I really thought they were gonna do a hack job so strongly that I almost didn't buy it)..<br /><br />You get love, sex, intrigue, betrayal and some really cool action, this is a milestone in the twilight series so much so that I actually am craving more and I mean NOW! Finally people have grown up, kids turn into adults and leave the high school child drama behind them while stepping into a whole new realm where lines will be drawn, bonds broken and all those childish walls will come crashing down.. For those of you that have loved these movies there is no reason why this would not become an instant favorite sure to be a classic in movies of this genre.. With this addition to the twilight series in movie form it has become an instant favorite to me and I will proudly put it right next to Interview with the Vampire, now that is saying something to me..<br /><br />For my fellow twilight book hounds then I will say that with being split into two parts it is able to build the story more closely to the book than any of the previous attempts, I won't say that they didn't leave anything out..Of course with any book to movie that is impossible but needless to say without spoiling anything they do shave off quite a lot on the jacob melodramatic side story which doesn't bother me because if they had to leave anything out I would rather them leave that out than to take away other more important aspects of the story...Now since they did the two part split, when you get to that all important part we were craving for and dieing to find out (TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS NEXT) :) ....Now they have a whole two more hours to really bare down on the really juicy stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Cheers Cheers and more Cheers for this ( I can't believe I'm saying it, Finally!)<br /><br />Lastly, to those concerned or worried still thinking hmmm should I get it? Is it really that good? Well I will say this, this film is not without it's slower parts to it but trust me they need it to build in to what is coming next and since they did this one the way it is I can tell you with sure certainty that they will NOT disappoint any of us in bringing probably the best conclusion to a series that I can ever remember( If they stick to what they did here)<br /><br />Bottom line pure wicked joy!!!ecome an instant favorite to me and I will proudly put it right next to Interview with the Vampire, now that is saying something to me..

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I actually purchased this app a couple of months ago. Until the latest update there were no ads. Since the latest update the first page advertises other G5 games, but there are no ads in the actual game. I LOVE this game. Someone complained that it doesn't work on the Kindle Fire. I have it on Kindle Fire and have never had even the slightest problem. I think some reviewers just don't like to see all good reviews.

006056251X|5.0|The Devil in Winter<br />Reviewed by Ann & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Devil in Winter is easily my favourite Wallflowers book!<br /><br />Under desperate circumstances, Evie appears at St. Vincent's home to offer him a proposal that solves both their problems. With marriage, St. Vincent can have access to Evie's accounts and Evie can gain protection and freedom from her cruel and crazy family.<br /><br />In the first two books, I never really thought much about Evie. She was just always present among the group, but until now I didn't realize how much she endured at the hands of her wicked family. No wonder she has a stutter and is afraid to stand up for herself! She is constantly put down and abused by her family. I adored her quiet strength and came to love Evie so much so that she's become my favourite Wallflower!<br /><br />Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent captured my heart in It Happened One Autumn. Even after his attempt at kidnapping Lillian, I found myself captivated by the notorious rake! Sebastian makes himself look like a villain, when in fact he's not. He makes mistakes, but he realizes his faults and after his transformation, he isn't afraid to apologize for his rash decisions.<br /><br />Several instances in this book showcase his ability to love and his potential to be a man of intelligence, talent and wit. I loved the moment where he shows respect and kindness to Evie's ill father, Ivo as he shaved him. Also, when he brought that heated brick to warm Evie's feet for the long journey to Scotland. Little things like that showcase his growth as a character and I can't help but love him more!<br /><br />I think this quote really sums it up well:<br /><br />\\"The situation was extraordinary. How someone like Evangeline Jenner could have wrought such a change in St. Vincent, the most worldly of men, was difficult to understand. However, Westcliff had learned that the mysteries of attraction could not always be explained through logic. Sometimes the fractures in two separate souls became the very hinges that held them together.\\"<br /><br />The love between St. Vincent and Evie is transformative. There's no doubt about it! The notorious rake becomes monogamous and in love while the stuttering wallflower becomes an elegant strong woman. I loved every moment of it!<br /><br />I have to mention that scene between Cam and Daisy, I'm so envious of her! This was one of my favourite scenes. The Cam in this book is very serious and dependable, but in this particular scene we get a glimpse of Cam's dark seduction that is very much evident in his own book (in a separate series) Mine Till Midnight. Loved it!<br /><br />Favourite Quote:<br /><br />In their shared excitement, the three young women continued to exclaim and scream, until someone burst into the room.<br />It was Cam, his eyes wide, his breathing fast, as if he had come at a dead run. His alert gaze flashed across the room, taking in the situation. Slowly his lean frame relaxed.<br />\\"Damn,\\" he muttered. \\"I thought something was wrong.\\"<br />\\"Everything in fine, Cam,\\" Evie said with a smile, while Annabelle kept an arm around her shoulders. \\"My friends are here, that's all.\\"<br />Glancing at Sebastian, Cam remarked sourly, \\"I've heard less noise from the hogs at slaughter time.\\"<br />There was a sudden suspicious tension around Sebastian's jaw, as if he were fighting to suppress a grin.es the fractures in two separate souls became the very hinges that held them together.\\"<br /><br />The love between St. Vincent and Evie is transformative. There's no doubt about it! The notorious rake becomes monogamous and in love while the stuttering wallflower becomes an elegant strong woman.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I purchased the Celtic Woman \\"Believe\\" DVD.  I have watched it twice and I really love it.  I went to one of their concerts once and couldn't see very well (plus I had to drive 3 hours to get there).  Now I can sit in the comfort of my recliner and I have a front row seat.  You won't be disappointed.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|If you love listening to Adele, you will really enjoy this.  I believe \\"21\\" is her best, but, \\"Adele 19\\" is really good.  I would highly recommend that you purchase her DVD....it's amazing!
1583334386|5.0|This is an outstanding book.  All these five-star reviews are valid representations of what you will find inside.  There is a two-star review which claims \\"liberal bias\\" but I'm extremely puzzled by that.  I didn't see even a hint of any such thing in this excellent book.  This isn't a political book, it's a book on willpower and is distinctly apolitical.  The format of the book is such that each chapter represents a particular willpower related concept.  The author describes examples, experiments, and research on that idea.  She then gives helpful advice on how to deal with it.  The end of each chapter has a couple of pages that summarize the chapter and key take-away points.  I read a large number of psychology and self-help books and I assure you this is one of the most helpful ones you will find.  It is very real world and practical.  I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  Huge thumbs up!  P.S.  The chapter called \\"Don't Read This Chapter: The Limits of 'I Won't' Power\\" is worth more than the price of the book by itself.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Love this game. I like games with storylines and mahjong. Was happy to see this as the free app of the day.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I'm glad I read the reviews so I didn't update. the games are a good time filler some a lot easier than others.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game! Warning- highly addictive but great fun. I wish there were more goals but other than that it is a great app.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun game cute story. pretty easy so far but I am enjoying it.  I got it for free but I gussy it is worth a purchase. probably not at five dollars though.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The first song I heard off \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" was \\"Tattoo,\\" and it underwhelmed me. Well, it's by far -- far -- the worst song on this album (why they didn't release \\"Blood and Fire\\" as their first single baffles me). The guitar work here more than makes up for the keyboards of the '90s, and brings back to center stage one of the greatest guitarists of our times, thrashing it like he's 20 with something to prove (the latter is likely true). David Lee Roth has the chops to battle to the front of this raucous band, with a voice that weaves through the sonic onslaught and scads of lyrical dexterity (he can scat as fast as Eddie can thrash). Thank you, Van Halen, for putting out an album that makes all of the songs I hear on the radio today sound sterile, homogenized, and weak. This album is a powerhouse of a real band playing for their lives. Great!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I thought \\"24\\" was the best show... I was wrong.  My mom told me about \\"Breaking Bad\\" and I thought.... o know because my mom likes it, it's a stupid show.  I have netflix Instant Stream and Breaking Bad Season 1, 2 and 3 where on it, so I thought what the hell and I watched the first season.  I said to my self WOW!!! and had to watch season 2 and 3.  I would HIGHLY!!!! recommend this show.

B006ON41FC|4.0|Collectibles and trophies keep you playing.  Worth a buck.  Kind of like the popular my paper plane series.  A little repetitive.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is really good, easy to use, and a nice accessible layout! At times it can be quite slow but so can computers other than that I would highly recommend this app!! :)
1559409002|5.0|Gorgeous blond woman drives off a bridge with her friends into the river.<br />She somehow walks out of the water, even though her three friends drowned.<br />A series of very strange happenings begin, including seeing a ghoulish face<br />suddenly in front of her at odd times.<br /><br />A huge abandoned carnival pavilion figures prominently in this as well as an old boarding house where she rents a room.  The one other tenant turns out to be the biggest creep in the world, leering, sneering and pushing himself on her constantly.  That guy alone made my skin crawl.  No one in the history of the movies has ever portrayed a slimey creep better.<br /><br />Pipe organs also are an important element, as the lady is a professional organist.  She suddenly is compelled to stop playing church music and begins to play scarey horror movie music on the church organ which causes the preacher to fire her with a stern lecture on playing the wrong kind of music.<br /><br />Every character in this movie is spooky in a very natural way, vaguely reminding me of every creepy old or young guy I ever met.  The yucky old men lecture her sternly, feeling like they must let her know they are superior morally, including a doctor who wants to \\"help\\" her by playing her psychiatrist.<br />The young sleazeball in the room across from her is manipulating for all he's worth, saying \\"you must not like me very much\\", \\"you're very cold, you must not like men\\", \\"this room of yours is very lonely at night, I'd be happy to keep you company\\", and on and on, leering, peeking at her through the door, showing up unexpectedly, bringing her coffee as soon as he hears her alarm go off in the morning, and totally pushing himself on her unmercifully.<br />He is a perfect charicature of a creep, finally running away saying \\"I don't need to get mixed up with a crazy lunatic like you\\".<br /><br />And then there's that ghoulish face appearing suddenly, looking through her window.<br />I had at least four instances of goosebumps, the hairs on my arms standing on end, as I watched this.  I can't remember when a movie did that to me.<br />This movie was written with not only an astute concept of what may happen after death, but also with an accurate portrayal of some types of characters that can be found in the real world that make a girl's skin crawl.<br />One of the most genuinely horrifying movies I've ever seen.  The setting, mood and atmosphere are guaranteed to give you chills.d this.  I can't remember when a movie did that to me.

B0067Q42BY|1.0|all this is is memory with the cards facing up. u get to match tiles that look alike over and over and over and over again...so stupid will be uninstalling. btw the ads that everyone freaks out about...not a big deal at all so if for some reason u like mahjong then feel free to get this app
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Full featured Bible, including multiple translations, study plans, and notifications. Would be 5 stars if more translations were downloadable for offline use.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a solid game with beautiful graphics. And finally, a game that works on LG Optimus, lol! I am really pleased with it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great now that I have your attention I love this app its great and are you addicted you are if you upset about losing progress
B0067Q42BY|5.0|beautiful graphics, fun story line, easy to use. great fun! would love to see more quality giames and brain teasers like this one.
B006ON41FC|5.0|super fun to play. i like earning acorns and then being able to buy cute clothes. people need to read before the start dissing an awesome easy time killing game. you can opt out of openfient.
0743298039|4.0|It was an intersting book, at first I did not think I was going to like it but it had lots of twists and turns and turned out to be interesting.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|great graphics. not to annoying sound track.  smooth flowing and interesting. my old Mahjong addiction may be on its way back!
B005K17RU0|5.0|accuweather is the best weather ap out that I have seen for forecast.  the forecast goes out for days a is pretty accurate.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Having been a fan of musicals for many years, I think this movie is terrific and I'm sorry I missed it at the cinema as it would have been great on the big screen. Good songs, terrific dancing, great cast, acting very good and I even liked the storyline. As soon as Christina Agilera starts her opening song,I'm hooked.I bought the DVD at Christmas and have watched it 3 times since then. I'm sure I'll watch it many more times
B006ON41FC|5.0|its delly fun cute and affordible. unlike other cool apps that all ways have their downfall of paying for &quot;money&quot; with ur credit cards this one has no downfall.  and its only 99cents
0345528581|4.0|I actually found this book at my local library, but have since purchased the softcover, e-book and iPad app.  I avoided exercise for over 40 years, and always hated going to the gym. I am not perfect and haven't realized infomercial results but I am in the best shape of my life after following the beginner and intermediate programs, and I'm seeing more results almost daily. It has motivated me to get going on running and adding other exercises to my program. Additionally, I travel a lot and this Is a perfect program to follow in any hotel room because there's little to no equipment required.
B005RUV714|3.0|This season lacks actions and has too much talking :) Not enough zombies either, gets boring pretty quick. Bring more zombies, please! :)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very good game. great graphics and animations. one of the best mahjong games I have seen on the Amazon site. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play mahjong.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game! Just as good as the others, and really good because it was free! Thanks G5 Entertainment and keep on bringing free games!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love the added story line and the graphics are very colorful.  entertaining with relaxation in one bundle of a game
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played solitaire for a long, long time starting in the 1960s with cards, then in 1985 on an IBM PC and now on my smart phone and tablet. I can honestly say this is the best Solitaire game I ever played. I recommend it highly with confidence.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics were excellent and it played very well on my HTC ECO View 4G
B0073LWEXK|5.0|cant wait for the next fire maple games!!! challenging but very enjoyable!!!!! great weekend or travel killer! totally worth the 2 bucks even fun the second time around :D
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta is about an imaginary dictatorship and one man's resistance. This man then gets the people to resist. The resister disguises himself with a white mask, which the Occupiers sometimes wear. I gave this DVD to my aunt Syl because she believes in the Occupiers and I wanted her to see the movie those masks are from. They may be from somewhere else before the movie but they're part of the movie.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|It has been long ago settled, Seiko makes a Quality watch. If you need or just have an impulse to buy another watch,( The Impulse is one I can certainly relate to! ) this watch is one you could buy while not in a state of reality and feel like Shylock when you actually hold it in your hands and put it on your wrist.  it's light on your wrist,so much so I sometimes forget to remove it at bed time which is my usual custom.It looks cool,and with its'  view to the movement through the back its a great conversation piece with the kids. Although not recommended the watch and I shower after a workout,no problems.The band is ballistic nylon (or some such thing ) and has what appears to be a leather strip reinforcing the tong eyes. For the price it's literally like \\" STEALING CANDY FROM A BABY\\" ! By the way it keeps excellent time.  ITS' MECHANICAL!! 10 out of 10
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong has always been entertaining.  I'm happy to see that I can play on my Kindle Fire just like I remember playing on my computer.  The only down is that I'm hitting the wrong tile occasionally just because I'm not great with the touch screen yet.  mahjong could be great practice.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I hate everything about this game the adds the freezing up deleted and seriously considering never downloading a G5 game again.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|THE NEW CONAN WAS GOOD, BUT,FOR ME IT JUST DIDNT HOLD THE MAGIC OF THE ORIGINAL BARBARIAN!DONT GET ME WRONG,THEY DID VERY WELL,BUT FOR A DIE HARD CONAN FAN LIKE ME,IT JUST DIDNT QUITE PUSH THAT OH YEAH BUTTON.BUT,ALL IN ALL,IT WAS A VERY WELL MADE MOVIE,I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY IT!
B001ER4CTI|3.0|Would have given it 5 stars but the digital copy had expired(buyer beware digital copies do expire), which is one of the reasons I bought this pack, other than that love the collectors edition.
B005PW3OS8|2.0|The movie starts off with some relatively interesting characters that just get flatter and flatter as the movie progresses.  What the movie has:  - explosions  - car chases  - gun fire by people who have exceptionally bad aim
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am enjoying this so much it is an awesome game and works great on my kindle fire! So glad I ignored some of the reviews.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|NOTHING WILL EVER BEAT THE ORIGINAL,BUT CLASH STILL ROCKS IN MY OPINION!I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND  PERCEUSES ATTITUDE ABOUT ACCEPTING HIS GIFT OF BEING A DEMIGOD,BUT IF YOU CAN GET PAST THAT THE STORY MOVES ALONG VERY WELL,I LIKED IT ALOT!GREAT MOVIE WATCHING EXPERIANCE.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome and I love it and I can wait till they make a new update it will be so awesome
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I got this free on my kindle. It is interesting. I have only played it a little though. Interesting twist mahjong.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this name is woo good for people like me if you what to try something new try this app I think this app is the funest in this hole app store
B000MV9026|5.0|ALWAYS A JOY TO WATCH!WITHOUT A DOUGHT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIMOVIES OUT THERE,I JUST DARE YOU TO WATCH IT AND NOT BE HAPPY INSIDE.IT TAPPED ITS WAY RIGHT INTO MY HEART!
B006ON41FC|5.0|its got decent graphics and its both challenging and simple...if I got my two year old niece to play it the controls are simple enough for her to understand and enjoy yet it is still enjoyable and challenging for me with some of the goals...all in all a great app
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Gameplay and graphics overall are excellent.  Very smooth on DroidX.  However, text in the game is much too small, and requires judicious use of the zoom function.  While the  forced ad on the opening screen is inappropriate for a paid game, it's easily bypassed.  -1* for the unreadable storyline and the ads.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|this app is the stupidest app ever this app is for un fun people I hate this app I'm glad I did not buy this app when it cost money
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it keeps my kids busy. I will always keep this app and it also has no problems or viruses. I just don't like the app download pause to get points.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|This movie is a must see for anyone who hasn't seen this!!! it's a pure classic 5 STARS. I guarantee you all having a blast seeing this... beats any of the new generation comedies!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|If you're looking for a traditional Mahjong, this is not the game. Too many special tiles and new rules. Nice graphics but I prefer a traditional Mahjong.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is one good good game I think its for any age.  best app(: (: (: I think every one to get if
B0078N2MTE|5.0|Wow.  This movie was powerful, and it was written, acted, directed, and edited to perfection.  Easily one of the best movies of 2011.  Jessica Chastain is fantastic in this movie.  Michael Shannon's performance is sublime, and his character is drawn perfectly.  I find it easy to reconcile both that he is becoming mentally ill, and that he has some prophetic vision.  A phenomenal film.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|Love it. Just the right amount of padding for protection. The Kindle Fire fits perfectly. Coral color was a nice choice also.
B001PB3RU8|1.0|This is not a review of the music, but a warning that the copy of this CD I got is copy-protected (or copy-corrupted). I can't get it to rip in a brand-spanking-new MacBook Pro. There is an obvious strip of etching on the CD, and it does not bear the official \\"CD Digital Audio\\" trademark (a good tipoff that the label is trying to mess with CD-ROM drives). It's pretty absurd to do this in the age of the iPod; of course if I buy the CD I'd like to exercise my fair use rights to rip the album onto my hard drive and portable music devices. Unless you *only* want to listen on a dedicated audio CD setup, probably best to just buy the mp3 version of the album. Lame.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|hi this is a really good strategy game I like it.a lot deginetly recommended for those who like strategy games
B0031RAOW8|1.0|The bluray dvd did not work. It would not play in my ps3 or my bluray dvd player. I just keep on getting a MSG on screen can not read disc I even try it on my friends bluray player to rule out it was not my equiptment problem very un happy
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Captivating story... still amazing how she didn't find a way out or alert someone when people came to visit but oh well... great story, very very interesting.
B006ON41FC|3.0|copy of temple run... except not as good... sometimes store wont open outfits stats and achvimetts... very annoying... other then that ok
B006YXTRHY|3.0|This was a bit of a downer compared to the first 3 in the Twilight series.  I was prepared for more warm and fuzzy feelings, and wondering how does a girl get so lucky to be in Bella's situation.  (seriously)  I just knew the honeymoon would be the best yet, but not so much.  But for sure, as did the others, you will anxisouly await the next in the series to see what happens.  (I still think she should have gone with Jacob...not that I'm into hairy men, but there is something to be said for a warm (rippling) body on a cold night.)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nicely done game app - Good graphics &amp; smooth controls. Works great on my evo 4g. Starts &amp; exits quickly, which is nice for killing time in lines, etc.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|just started to play this. I liked it, but I am wondering if it  will be challenging. Game is quite relaxing.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very addictive very fun...... Great way to waste a bunch of time! not too many ads and there aren't a bunch of ads to deal with
159420229X|4.0|Even though this book was on my soon-to-read list, Mark beat me to it and reviewed it already. I'm glad that he did, as he has been propagating the memory palace idea in our discussions lately, and it spurred me on to read it sooner than I would have.<br /><br />The book is more of an overview of memory history rather than specific techniques to help readers improve our own memorizing. Although through the narrative of having Foer report on memory and eventually winning the U.S. Memory Championship, he discusses many little tricks along the way. These were helpful in my own thinking about memory. I also found some of the case studies of memory prodigies and memory-deficit people particularly fascinating.<br /><br />Foer is overly critical and insulting about Tony Buzan, the granddaddy of memory techniques, an aspect about the book that I found to be mean and ungracious, as Buzan seemed kind enough to grant him an interview. I also am hesitant about how ingrained Foer is within his own story here. Unlike another similar journalist-becomes-subject account Born to Run, Foer borders on self-serving.<br /><br />While it starts to feel too long toward the end, I really did enjoyed reading this. It helped me to think more about memory and how I can memorize more Scripture and poetry. Maybe even a deck of cards or two.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|fun and easy to play. got this as part of a special free price. do not think worth $5. do not like how hard it is to leave a review and that game bugs you to do it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Not every app is for every device; some I have on my android phone won't run on my Galaxy or on my Fire. So glad this one works on the Galaxy :-)
B006ON41FC|5.0|mcquenn picked this game for funnn and for$. Arbys is terrible if u don't like sandwhiches like me :( :)
1410427188|3.0|Becky Brandon (Bloomwood) is back. With her daughter Minnie now a toddler growing as a partner in shopping. But, Minnie may be picking up some habits from Becky. Her favorite word is \\"Mine\\", she is banned from multiple paces, and that is just outside the house. Combine that with Becky and Luke still living with her parents, (the houses just keep falling through) and Luke now has extra stress at work with a nationwide financial crisis int he works.  So, what does Becky do. She plans a surprise party for Luke for his birthday, even though he has made her promise not to spend money and she has to wear everything in her clothes at least three times before she can buy anything new. Becky tries to plan the party without help, but may have to remember who she can turn to in the end.  I am not sure why I read these books sometimes. Yes, I enjoy them and fly right through them. But, the shopaholic books usually stress me out too. Becky just keeps spending that it stress me out to buy anything or spend money while reading them. I know that is silly, but I get so wrapped up in what the character is doing I take it personally I guess.  Kinsella has built this character well over the course of the books. But, there is no where for her to go and she doesn't seem to learn anything in the plot or through the books. This is another one that she accomplished her goal, but didn't learning anything.  I happened across this book in at the library, so I grabbed it. But, I don't think I would go out of my way to read more of the Shopaholic series. I am hoping to read Kinsella's other books soon and hope those keep growing like her past ones have been better than the Shopaholic series.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Very good easy game for kids, although not too challenging, still seems enjoyable to them. Works well on Kindle fire.
B004LROUW2|1.0|The NYT book review is one  of the few that can stop kissing Murakami's butt long enough to actually evaluated the book at hand.  Much of what he writes about seems recycled from prior novels.  His style is spare, which you might like, or you might just find it to be a lack of style.  His obsession with breasts is boring, as he tends to describe them over and over with the exact same phrases for no apparant reason.  And if you are going to create an alternate world, why create on in which 10 year old girls are raped by a middle aged man (including his own daughter) as part of a religious ceremony?  But its not really sex - - despite graphic descriptions of what may seem to people in this reality as a sex  - - and call me a prude, but I wasn't really open minded enough to follow him down the rabbit hole an that one.  (or a number of other holes that he will talk about in depth.)  This book is bloated, boring and repetitive.  I read far more of it than I should have, hoping it would get better and justify its praise, but it really didn't.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the book has alot mid way through the book and the beginning kind of drags on for about 3 chapters. but the book is good for any1 into books that involve a lot of action and cliffhangers. let the games begin
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use, and I like the choices for type of hand dealt. Always runs fine, and serves as the same great diversion Solitaire has been.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've played other mahjong but this one actually teaches you. graphic is good. i like the story telling part. keep it interesting. great game. its free... get it now!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Yes, Whitney doesn't sound exactly the same as she did 10 years ago. Her voice is a little more deeper and little bit raspy. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Her voice is still GREAT and just sounds seasoned! Songs like I Look to You, I Didn't Know My Strength are just as strong as the material she sang in the 80s. Million Dollar Bill and A Song For You are infectious. This is a good album that I hope people discover.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I'm a big fan of mahjong so this is perfect!!! had so much fun and my kids also love it!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Started playing after download (thanks for the FREE download Amazon) and I am enjoying it so far. Will update after more time spent with it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Have had some problems connecting to Internet &amp; linking with online account occassionally! would like to see newer translations for download!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Addicting...and frustrating!  (Kindle Fire) controls not as sensitive as we'd like, but still a ton of fun! Great alternative to not being able to buy Temple Run.
B005K2XP6Y|4.0|This case for my Kindle works very well and protects it.  It is smalll enough to fit in a large purse, but that is also the one negative-it holds nothing else, so if you want to take other items, you will need a separate carrier.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This app is fun to help pass the time.  I enjoy the quest features. It is not too challenging for youngsters.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app as much as I tried it never worked it kept saying error so I had to delete it so don't waste your time!!
B001SGEULU|5.0|I've been an Oasis fan for a long time and stopped listening after The Masterplan came out.  This album got me listening to their newer stuff.  I really love this album.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|We had received a new TV for Christmas.  It had 3D capabilities.  We ordered Lion King and really enjoyed it.  The kids will enjoy this for years to come.
B006ON41FC|2.0|It's a fun game but it's buggy. Freezes and crashes on my s2 skyrocket. Auto log in into open feint which I despise and the game itself has no growth. I'd like to have permanent upgrades to the character, not to items that I have to buy. It entertained me for two days until the issues mentioned above just made me uninstall it.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Enough has been said about the content of this book in numerous earlier reviews; it is a solid read, full of fascinating information, well and clearly presented. Others will have to evaluate further the discussions of omissions around cancer research and treatment.  Comment is due on the Kindle formatting of the book. The appearance of the text I received was so far from the acceptable standards of academic writing - including missing footnotes, spurious links and highlighting, and a muddled and unusable index - that I contacted Amazon about a possible malfunction in my Kindle software.  The outcome of several hours on the phone was a replacement Kindle, a text with the identical corruption, and a note and call from Amazon indicating that Simon & Schuster were responsible for the formatting of the electronic edition. I was advised to edit the text of my Kindle book on my own device and to contact Amazon and the publisher with a list of corrections to enable them to do further editing!  Kindle users are (or should be) aware of the limitations of the technology with regard to reproduction of tables, maps,diagrams, and illustrations. Egregious errors in basic notation are not a function of these limitations, and render this text almost unreadable.  Given the huge profit margins in electronic sales, Amazon has a duty to customers to address this problem by establishing clear standards for electronic formatting of any publication sold for Kindle use.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Really like mahjong games and this is a really good game.  Hours and hours of enjoyment.  I would highly recommend it.
0345528581|5.0|A co-worker recommended this book.  I was toying with the notion of a home gym, but this book makes more economical and space availability sense for me.  I'm in decent shape, but no marathoner by any means. I am just starting the basics, and have discovered that several of the exercises are those my physical therapist taught me to strengthen my back.  Also, two exercises were ones I unknowingly did daily while cleaning houses!  So far, the exercises and pep talks in this book are interesting.  Eager to start and see results.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game. It took me a minute to realize that in order to play the the game you have to complete the tutorial first. Enjoyable game! Thank you!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Interesting combo of adventure and board game.  Plays great on DroidX and rooted Nook Color.  Tutorial takes less than 2 mins to finish and then you're on to the game.

1609611543|5.0|I purchased this book on the advice of my Osteopath (thanks Doc, you're the best!).  Upon reading Amazon reviews, I was impressed that other physicians concure with Dr. Davis's findings.  This book brings together all the information on today's version of \\"wheat\\" and its harmful effects on our bodies.<br />I could not figure out what was going on with my weight gain over the past few years. I am physically active and am careful to eat a healthy diet, yet my toned mid-section had disappeared under a layer of unsightly fat within two years of menopause. My regular clothes weren't fitting well at all.  Talk about frustration searching for new jeans!  Was this \\"change of life\\" the sole reason behind such a weight gain? My doctor and the author of \\"Wheat Belly\\" had a different angle on my quandry.<br />Following my Osteopath's suggestion to avoid wheat, I began to eliminate wheat systematically from my diet and read Dr. Davis's book for further education.  It is not that difficult or expensive to change to wheat free if you start at the basics (check out the \\"Gluten Free on a Shoestring\\" book on Amazon.com or visit their website for free, easy to prepare recipes).<br />After a few weeks, weight is beginning to come off and I feel better overall. This book explains clearly and without political apologies how modern wheat harms our health. Read this book, eliminate wheat from your diet and you will see results.<br /><br />July 30th, 2012 update:<br />Since eliminating most wheat from my diet, I have lost 20 pounds since February. I have changed nothing in my lifestyle, other than eliminating as much wheat as possible.  I have not increased exercising; in fact I should make an effort to go for more walks, etc...  As always, I go easy on sugary foods, which is a key component to health and weight loss.  I feel great, and am able to keep up with much younger co-workers and a demanding work schedule. My sinuses seem to have improved.  Switched to humus and avacodo paste on rice/flax crackers for lunches.  I also love Silk brand almond milk (their chocolate is wonderful) and organic coconut milk (Silk brand and others).  They are delicious, nutritious and reasonably priced at local grocery stores.  Occassionally, I'll have pizza or a Subway sandwhich, as a treat.  There are lots of options available to reduce wheat in your diet, simply read labels and do a bit of research.  And, it does not have to be expensive.  It is so good to fit back into my old jeans.  I still have several pounds to go and am motivated to remain as wheat-free as possible from now on.  Dr. Davis has hit the nail on the head with his book.<br /><br />Update Jan. 2013:  After nearly one year I feel great and am able to keep up with added multi-tasking at work due to job eliminations. I was careless through the Holidays - enjoyed sugary treats and too much wheat. What a difference in my overall healthy feeling.  I felt stuffy, bloated - the effect wheat and sugar were having, a sure sign wheat-free is the way for me to live. If I stick to wheat-free and avoid sugar, I don't feel very hungry and have lots of energy. Also, no sinus problems at all.  The weight has stayed off and I am down another belt loop.  Just remember, you must use discipline.  Do your best to eat according to what Dr. Davis suggests and avoid sugars.  Exercise by walking or cleaning your home and gardening.  Eliminating as much wheat as possible from my diet has been a blessing!e/flax crackers for lunches.

B0071QIN00|2.0|Inconsistent controls + overly complex physics + overly simplistic levels = horrible gaming experience. Lacks polish and fun. Even a waste when it was free.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love the new bubbles, gold circles, and wooden spikes. More to think about! New challenges!  I've been waiting for the new Quell!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|The adverts are annoying and so was the tutorial, but the game itself is ok. I dislike that once you match the gold tiles the game ends, the game starts with the hint button on, and it's got a strange format. Random Mahjong Pro is a WAY better app in my opinion.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like mahjong games and this one seems to top the others. I will be watching for new mahjong games to come out in the future.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's really fun.  You should try it!  The story that goes along with the game is also cool.  It makes you think.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great graphics.  creative stories offer an additional level of enjoyment.  it is easy to spend hours playing this game. it's a perfect game to help pass time on a flight.
0439023521|5.0|This was an unexpected surprise - I didn't expect to enjoy this story as much as I did, particularly with the serious nature of the content.It was fast paced and kept my attention throughout.  I got to know the characters well and felt part of their lives.  The heroine, Katniss, is not only realistic but easy to relate to.  She is not a super-hero but a brave individual who keeps to her personal integrity and fights for what she believes in.  More Katniss's in the world would make it a better place. I look forward to the movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is probably the best game I have EVER played on my kindle fire. Sure all you guys say oh it connects to openfeint automatically and blab blah. Personally it doesn't bother me. Guys seriously. I wouldn't just say this for no reason. I am 13 years old and this is a very good game. It has good graphics, good idea, and a cute little animal. Its challenging, ADDICTIVE. GET THIS APP. Seriously. Love, Megan
B003IEJZUG|5.0|In my advanced english class we have book groups and the one I had to read was Life of Pi. I picked it because I knew he was with animals and I looooove animals! The Beginning of the book was like a dream to me, it felt like a fun zoology textbook. I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up so you can imagine how I loved to learned about how zoos work and three toed sloths. Then the second part of the first section was about religion which I don't care for much but was still entertaining the way the author made the stories. The second section of the book is about him being stranded and is like a survival story. So overall, I LOOOOVED this book and it entertained me greatly.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game, tons of fun. My kids love playing this. Runs perfectly on motorola milestone x. Highly recommend as a time killer.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game to play on a snowy Sunday afternoon. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes to play mahjong.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very cool game... I love the puzzle aspect of the game. The only thing is that I got it yesterday and I am almost done with it already, I want to know if they will add more levels.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|Different feelings from the 2004 movie. It's the most spectacular show - although La Carlotta voice is a little bit toned down and It's unbelievable the diva got unpleasant speaking voice. Jaw microphones are very distracting, especially when close up. SB is too active, she smiled all the time and I don't recall Christine being this cheerful in any version. Anyhow, her voice is angelic except at the lower octaves. I like RK better in LND.

B004A8ZX28|2.0|There are a lot of reviews talking about the plot, so I won't go into them, I'll just talk about why I thought the movie was disappointing.<br /><br />There are a lot of reasons to watch a movie - it might have your favorite actors, or be cinematically beautiful, or have great music, or be sexually stimulating, or it might have a fascinating story line.<br /><br />None of these pertain to this movie.<br /><br />Liam Neelsen is a good action-figure, that's true, but there were so many plot holes that I just had to give up and say \\"This is a lame Hollywood movie written for people who are just graduating from Saturday morning cartoons\\", to keep from getting too irritated.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only thing that saved it was the final ending, when we found out who was calling the shots.  They should have taken fifteen seconds from some of the chase scenes and put it more into going in depth with the motivations of the people setting the whole thing up.<br /><br />I don't want to be a spoiler here, but anyone who says these things don't happen should research Royal Rife, Wilhelm Reich, The Adventures of other Free Energy Activists at &lt;...>, or \\"Dead Scientists and Microbiologists\\" at &lt;...>, or just do some searches on strange deaths.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|This is only, perhaps, the item that is available in Thailand but not yet in the U.S. I have watched this show in Melbourne last fall far away from the stage (it was the unplanned ticket). I have never seen the show in London that has already closed but I have listened the London production audio CD sung by RK and SB over 100 times !  Seeing this show again on BD - it's quite spectacular. Like the microphone on the forehead, far less distracting than the jaw one like in 25th POTO. However, remembering remotely from the live show back then, I don't recall - Till I hear you sing started the story - I noticed lot of changes in lyrics and also sequences and many parts of story. Like some of them but don't like some of them, too  - i.e. the way phantom forced Christine to sing in this Australian production - in London audio CD - it seems like Christine has agreed to do it voluntarily.  Don't like the way Ben Lewis doesn't sing high note on \\"be enthralled to need...\\" in beauty underneath, and the boy has to do the same. Like the London version better on this one. Also - Devil takes the hind most, my Dear old friends (but the Oz version makes more sense)- like London version better.  Otherwise, it's quite a nice show - spectacular, ravishing and breathtaking - I had hoped that Christine will bleed from the GSW since this is the BD recording - they should have invested on that. It's a close up and there was no blood on the dying shot person.  Still love it anyway. Love Anna singing voice - couldn't decide who's better between SB or AB.
0895260131|5.0|I am glad I read this book and will be sharing it with as many people as possible. Islam's sole purpose in life is to bring the West under their boot of Sharia Law and the Hadith. We have been fighting this war on and off since the Crusades. I will believe Islam is willing to live in peace with the West when a Christian group can go into any Muslim country and build a Church without being flogged or murdered. Only then will I believe Islams wants to live with us in peace. Right now the Muslim Brotherhood is building an Islamic Caliphate to battle the West. This will not end well. I hope America still has the fight in her to turn back this assault on the West.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is super fun but can get frustrating, but it allows the variety of games and it also gives you a knowledge of spending wisely because a lack of coins is the only thing that can stop you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Truly user friendly and offers many versions that you can download and listen to. Also a large variety of reading plans to help you stay consistent.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|When I bought this, I thought I knew the story. You know, the overdone cliche of the dark, stormy night, the sudden flash of lightning and the evil cry of Â«It`s alive!Â» as the shrouded figure rises from the stretcher. Buckle up folks. This is a dark, disturbing tale that cautions against overambition and foolish, willful persverance against nature. I love this story, and I know you will too. And seriously. Its free. Just read it.<br /><br />Hannah McLellan
B0067Q42BY|5.0|thanks for the game really enjoying it keep up the great work.  Every game that I have. chosen and was free have been very good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game deserves an A+ because of it's awsomeness. I love how there is a wide variety to pick from.
0375842209|4.0|I need to make myself a bumper sticker or a t-shirt so as to announce it to the world: I FINISHED THE BOOK THIEF. Finally.<br /><br />Five tries. First time, I hated the idea of Death as main character. Gave the book away. Second time, I got irritated with all the sad, miserable people. Turned the book back into the library. Third time, I tried listening to it on CDs. The narrator's voice was too supercilious for me. Fourth time, I again bought a copy. Found the choice of books Liesel was stealing to be poor choices. Gave book away again.<br /><br />Every time I gave up, I ran across a rave review of the book. I was determined to read the entire book this time.<br /><br />All the things that bothered me every time the other times I tried the book...they still bothered me a bit. But the book's powerful story outweighs its irritations. From this book: Death is a sympathetic character. Love wins. Even people who come across as cruel have a good side. Death is the great equalizer. Compassion can beat back wickedness. Words can save you.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|Michael Shannon did it again. Portraying a flawed, disturbed character like no one else in movies today. Michael Shannon was brilliant in [[ASIN:B000T5O48K Bug (Special Edition)]] with Ashley Judd.  Thankfully, he has a chance to shine again with formidable co-stars, crew and director. You must see this movie, either to understand auditory and visual hallucinations, or simply to see a slower paced, under your skin movie, that is a milestone for Hollywood in terms of acting and production.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love it. Angry Birds was a blast! I got the new year of the dragon. It was very amazing!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very happy with the Marware cover. I was very used to my second generation Kindle's lightness and found the Fire a bit slippery. The marware cover is not only very well fitting I like the feel of it and the sense of safety it provides for the Fire. I think I made a good choice.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game grabbed me from the beginning, and kept me playing. There are multiple endings to this game, and the point of the game is to play through the game multiple times (fast forwarding through repeated parts) to achieve the true ending. Each time you play through the game, you have the chance to make different decisions, which completely alters the ending you arrive at. The catch is that you have to play through some endings in order to get to the true ending.  The actual story is quite interesting, and there's a lot of reading between/during each puzzles. The complexity of these puzzles varies. However, at times, the hints give away too much.  This was my first time playing this genre of game and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best I have ever had.  Can use it everywhere without bothering anyone or can share with everyone.  Have even used it in the mountians of Arkansas and the hills of Louisiana. &quot;
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I really wanted to like this album, but after playing it a dozen times I've come to the conclusion that it just bores me. I'm not saying it's awful, but for some reason this album is just not doing it for me. Maybe it's TOO laid back, all these sleepy blues numbers are making me feel drowsy. I've been a big Allman Brothers fan for decades and like Gregg's singing a lot. The best thing about this album is that his vocals sound very, very good. Age has not tarnished that great voice.For me, I think the problem lies with the choice of material on this album. Many of these blues standards have been done better by other artists. Gregg may be sincere in wantig to get back to his \\"roots\\" with this record, but it's not going to be one I play much more in the future.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|I made it through about 45 minutes of this movie.  The concept was cool.  However, Timberlake is not a dramatic actor. On the bright side, there is lots of unintentional comedy!
B006ON41FC|5.0|its ok i guess I'm just doing this so it will stop asking me to rate...i hope but its not the worst game ever it is very addicting
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is a great game. when I got it I thought it was going to suck but it turned out preety well
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just got this game today for free (awesome), and I love it. you will be addicted to it I sware

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Men cannot APPRECIATE A movie like this one. I love this film. Its beautiful and amazing and wonderfully done. It was intriguing and a wonderful watch. Best 2 hours of my life and my mom bought it for me as a gift. One that wont be soon forgotten.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I went nuts playing this game. I could not put my kindle down. It is amazing and all.should play it.
B006DHAT5K|3.0|This was a rather good and entertaining movie. There were some funny spots. Worth  checking out. This would be considered a girly flick.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it! Makes the Book of God more interesting! it helps me a lot in Bible class also. Download this!!!!!
B0071QIN00|4.0|Level 13 is soo hard. I agree with NH I mean it is seriously impossible to pass that level! it is so difficult but other than level 13 I love this game it is really cool.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I didn't think the game all that well organized, and a little boring (it lacked solid puzzles). On a positive note, it was fast.
B0062P3392|4.0|Plenty of action with Stathan and DeNiro and Owen. Would recommend this movie. It kind of drags in spots but overall it is a film worth watching.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Nice use of bonus tiles. The tutorial at start of game is helpful and the graphics are good too. Free game, best part.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I first started using it my kindle fire and since added it to my phone and PC.  This is must have and will be added to any future devices that I get.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Cool game. The graphics are nice and the story that goes with it is kind of cool for kids. Good way to pass time while you are waiting for appointments or whatever.
0439023521|3.0|First, the writing was 'technically' good.  The story flowed along drawing me in.  All basic story-telling techniques were skillfully employed.  However I found this book lacking in some ways.  Character Development -  Even though we live in the head of the main character her inner psychology comes off as cliche despite the extrordinary circumstances of the premiss.  Analysis -  Again, the premiss seems to promise insight into human nature and society but falls short.  Vonnegut's books famously lacked full psychological character development but made up for it with deep dark smart subversive satire.  This is a well written tween book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|5Stars! I like this version with the story line. It gives the game a little more ...interest than just matching<br />tiles.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|thought I had finally gotten a descent free app of the day but it wont work on my fire. it goes to the first game but I cant do anything.  I even clicked on the hint button and it didn't light any tiles up. big disappointment!!!!!!<br /><br />update:  it took a while but this app finally works on my fire and is doing fine.  the graphics are really nice and i haven't had any trouble with it.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|We purchased Coraline when it first came out on DVD after seeing it in the theater.  Our new dog, however, recently managed to get the case open and chew the disc itself.  So we ordered this on Amazon right away.  It came quickly and we are happy to have this amazing movie back again.  It's our favorite Tim Burton stop motion movie, and we didn't think anything could surpass The Nightmare Before Christmas.  It's creepy, yes, but clever and a visual masterpiece, and my kids LOVE it, even my 5 year old was happy to have it back.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is  pretty good, but the graphics suk. so,yea.Could be better,but it is good overall! it is cool, if I didn't mention it before.

B006UG90RM|1.0|I don't go back to the 70's for Van Halen. I wasn't even born when the first album came out. Balance was my first Van Halen album, and I really enjoyed most of it. The self titled debut was my second album, and as you'd imagine I loved that one too. It took me a few years, but collected the entire Van Halen discography, through Balance, and there are plenty of good songs on each album. Although there are songs I didn't enjoy pretty much on each album.  Overall I enjoy a tone of Van Halen material, and I have no Sammy vs Dave bias. I have little nostalgia. I'm reviewing this album based on its own merits, or lack there of.<br /><br />We haven't heard much of anything from these guys since 1998. You'd think with so much time in between albums they'd have time to make something great. So, what do they release instead? they give us a bunch of old demos, re-worked into supposed new songs. I'm not opposed to them releasing an album like this, but not after 14 years. After that time, we deserve much more than leftovers that weren't good enough for their early albums. AND, where the hell is Me Wise Magic, and Can't Get That Stuff No More? Me wise magic would easily be the best song on the album. The other song would still be one of the better songs on here, and they should have been on here.  I've since heard the originals to the 5 or so songs that were old demos, and the originals sound a lot better.  Dave still had some range back then.<br /><br />Style wise there isn't a surprise. It sounds like something Van Halen would do, with many songs, being old demos, having guitar tones sounding like previous albums. Dave's voice isn't what it use to be, but having heard those 2 songs from the 90's, it's not a surprise, and his voice doesn't sound terrible.  The music is mostly uninspiring. The vocal melodies, aren't any better. The songs are very unmemorable. The sad thing is the most memorable songs are the 2 worst songs on the album, which also rival the worst in Van Halen's catalog, Tattoo, and Stay Frosty. Both are just awful. This being the first album in 14 years is a disgrace. We the fans deserve better. Some of these songs started to grow on me, but I'm tired of albums that HAVE to grow on me to enjoy them. There needs to be at least a few really good songs that stand out at first, and they aren't here.<br /><br />Tattoo 1/10 is a mid tempo song with soft verses. The music is pretty blah, and uninspiring. The melodies in the verses/ pre chorus are equally boring, but neither kill this song outright. With solid lyrics and a decent chorus this song could still be down right passible. But instead we get horrific lyrics, almost equaling Steel Panther's \\"And some poop in the produce section, ew stinky\\", still the worst lyric I've ever heard, but at least they're a joke band, so you don't take them seriously. And, the chorus is like nails on a chalkboard, \\"tattoo tattoo\\", uh even the vocals are awful. Even with better lyrics this song would still be a throw away song because of that awful melody. This makes Judas Priest's You say yes I say no, no no no no no\\" seem like lyrical poetry. When is their new album coming out by the way?<br /><br />She's The Woman 7/10 is a faster tempo song, and rocks a bit more than the past piece of crap they call a song. It's still not a really fast song or anything. The melodies are ok, I guess. The chorus is a little too repetitive, but not terrible. Overall this is a passible song, but it'd be easily forgotten on another Van Halen album.  This is another example of why Dave should never be allowed to write lyrics, though the song itself has grown on me.<br /><br />You And Your Blues 7/10 sounds a bit unfinished, but is an alright song. Could've used Mike's backing vocals. The guitars have an 80's Diver Down, 1984, 5150 type sound to them. This one's another mid tempo rocker with a faster chorus.<br /><br />China Town 8/10 ok this sounds a little more like vintage Van Halen. It's a fast paced rocker, withsome nice drumming, and solid guitar work, as you'd expect. The melodies are decent.  This song's grown more on me, and it's pretty fun.<br /><br />Blood And Fire 6/10 is up tempo. This song has a Diver Down sound to it. Overall it's alright, but nothing special. Hopefully this one grows more on me. The melody in the chorus needs work, but otherwise it's not a terrible song. I like the sound of this one.<br /><br />Bullethead 5/10 is a fast paced rocker. Decent riff, but the song doesn't go anywhere. The melodies aren't that good.<br /><br />As Is 9/10 starts slowly, but picks up. This might be my favorite song on the album. it's kind of fun. Dave rambles a little, which is a little annoying. I never liked his rambling, even in the classic tunes.  Actually this is hands down my favorite song on here.  The chorus is pretty fun.<br /><br />Honeybabyblahblah 4/10 has a really stupid name. It starts with some weird noises, before going into a fast paced rocker. Dave talks through this song. Stupid lyrics, again. I kind of like the music on this one, and the vocals are tolerable, but the lyrics and the ridiculous title ruin it for me.<br /><br />The Trouble With Never 5/10 eh an up tempo rocker. Again this one has stupid lyrics, and I don't really like the vocals that much. I could deal with them better if the lyrics were better.<br /><br />Outta Space 8/10 is another fast paced rocker. This one has a decent riff in the verses. This one's ok, but really could use Mike's backing vocals. I don't really like the \\"outer space\\" part, but it's not too long, so it's tolerable.  This one has grown more on me.  My second favvorite song on the album.<br /><br />Stay Frosty 1/10 I didn't like this song when it was called Ice Cream Man, so I'm definitely not going to like this song. This is Ice Cream Man 2, same style and everything. It's mostly acoustic, with the full band coming in towards the end.<br /><br />Big River 6/10 starts with a clean guitar riff, before moving into a slower than normal for this album, but still upper mid tempo rocker. This one has potential, but really doesn't have a hook. I just can't get into this one.  This one has grown more on me and while it's not my favoritesong on the album, it's alright.  Definitely better than a lot of the songs on here, and the only song not in the original 4 or 5 I liked to grow enough on me to consider it a keeper.  I like the clean intro.<br /><br />Beats Working 5/10 This one's a slower paced rocker. The pace picks up slightly in the chorus. The melody in the chorus needs work. This is another song that sounds unfinished. It has potential, but just sounds sluggish. Not terrible, but not great.<br /><br />If this had been released after they released an actual new album, I'd think higher of it, but for this to be their first album in 14 years is a disgrace, and a slap in the face to all their fans.  If you're new to the band this is not the place to start. Get their self titled album instead, or Fair Warning.
1609611543|3.0|The good: The book is an interesting read for the first half or so. For me, the information was new and insightful. Of course we know that genetically modified food exists and is being consumed, but have these really been tested on humans? Apparently not. I am well into week 2 of a gluten-free diet, mainly avoiding modern grains. I can already feel the differences the author talks about. I have struggled with weight and digestion issues for 15 years. For the first time ever I actually do feel full longer with less food. I'm blown away at how little it takes to keep me full, alert and going on long work days. No more 2:00pm crashes and morning muffin runs (which simply makes you even hungrier). If the author is correct, then on a broad scale food geneticists and more so the corporate greed behind them are responsible for sickening millions of people who simply can't properly digest today's mutant alien dwarf grains.  The downside: While the author does a fantastic job of setting up his ideas...he closes terribly. The \\"now what\\" sections are not linear and poorly correlated and summarized. The recipe section should be removed and properly vetted. I've tried three recipes and all were sub par or simply gross (Tofu Chocolate Mousse was horrible). This is a significant waste of money for experimentation purposes as the alternate ingredients are sometimes quite costly (i.e. almond flour ain't cheap).  So 5/5 on the idea. 1/5 on the \\"Now what\\" or \\"how to change\\" sections. Can't wait for a 2nd revised edition though. Regardless - I still would recommend the book.
B00338QENI|5.0|Gripping, well written and informative. Best read I have had in ages. people who enjoy history and memiors will highly enjoy this book.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Just when I was getting sick and tired of todays music Florence and the machine breathed hope back into my ears.Florence Welch is the new Stevie Nicks.Very nice mix of Stevie Nicks/Grace Slick/Susie and the Banshees/PJ Harvey/Susan Vega all rolled up into a burrito of talent and revised for todays music.Her band is is as powerfully talented as she is.Can't wait to get the rest of her music.Seeing her perform this live would probably be mindblowing.Leave Lady Ga ga,Kiesha,and the like for the children to have their brains filled with mush and enjoy real talent.

B005HGZV6U|1.0|I bought the european version of the blu-ray and it just didn't play well, the image kept freezing up and the blu-ray player making noises searching information on the disc, as I could perceive the image quality is not at the blu-ray level, I'll return it to the seller and buy the DVD version instead.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Try Random Mahjong, much better graphics and no promos for other games.  Also I couldn't find a way to turn off the tutorial, I know how to play mahjong.

1416562605|5.0|I loved this book.  It was wonderfully written and gave me a lot to think about.  I actually tried to read it a few years ago but couldn't get into it and I'm glad I gave it another try this time.  It was almost as good as A Fine Balance, which is saying a lot.  Wonderful book!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|It is a shame to admit, but I did not purcahse this movie until after the death of Whitney Houston. I had watched bits and peices at one time or another. Finally watched it all! Enjoyed it so much, I ordered one for my friend.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|so far, so good. easy game play, nice graphics. only been playing about 5 minutes,  but still I'm satisfied. /
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is very fun to play with mom. I think all kids should play with mom and dad. great time!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It has great graphics and is a great way to pass the time.  One of the better games that I've purchased.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|IT'S THE PRICE THAT IS WRONG.<br />The Christmas episode is wonderful. What a delight to see the tree in Downton Abbey all lit up, towering over the guests in their Christmas finery. It has the typical super writing and storyline through the time of Christmas Day, when the staff gets time off to themselves and the family serves themselves. It happens again as the story moves on into New Years Day 1920. It is a wonderful experience of the holidays in 1919-20 that one can't forget easily. You likely will like to decorate next year's Christmas tree as the Crawley's did in 1919, just a shorter version, unless you have a living room the size of a basketball court.<br /><br />But why spend the money they want for this when you can get the whole second season 8 episodes, plus the Christmas special all in one? Well, I guess, Region one people were short changed this time in the series and it, according to reviews, did not include Christmas. Region 2 has it. And the performance of Maggie Smith, the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley, is worth the price in itself. Watch her face in her every scene.<br /><br />The savings link:<br />[[ASIN:B005Q1W10A Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Unedited Edition)]] OR FOR A BIT MORE, there is a Season 2 Blu-ray too. I've been told not worth it unless you have a very very large TV screen.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great I was immediately hooked and I would recommend it to pretty much all ages. This game is very appropriate for all.
B003DT194G|1.0|Essentially this movie is nothing more than permission to daydream while looking at pretty pictures.  You could achieve the same effect laying on your back on a windy cloudy day telling a story from the shapes you see in the clouds.  The only difference is that you wouldn't feel like your time was justified.  The main failure occurred at the script stage.  The characters' behavior often contradicts their own motivations.  The plot has large holes that are inexcuseable. But if you are into 'simple' pleasures you might enjoy looking at and listening to this mess of a movie.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun anytime anywhere. If you love solitaire majong, you will be very satisfired with this game. Glad I got it.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|In what universe do paid apps have ads?  if you want ad revenue, make the app free. greed breeds contempt
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love this app. works great on the kindle fire. I'm all ready addicted. Def, should get this if your a mahjong fan!!!

B006ON41FC|5.0|Going nuts is a fun but challenging game of collecting nuts. When I first played it I couldn't put it down It was fun it was challenging but that's what I like in a game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think you should geg this game it has everything you can think of and you will never get bored with it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has exceeded my expectations.  Much better than Weather Channel application and so far has been much more accurate. I continue to find and use features regularly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everyday, I have it on my browser, kindle, and phone. It allows me to keep my multiple businesses organized even while on the go. I love it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazing app! Works great with the Kindle Fire. And best of all if doesn't cost per month the desktop client is free! Nice controls and little to.no lag when connecting,
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book is definitely a fun read -hence the 5 stars -  but that is not what this review is about.  The humor in the narrative is found in the footnotes which have to appear at the foot of the page to which the footnote refers or the point is lost.  The kindle edition has all of the footnotes at the end of each chapter where their impact is completely lost.  In fact, if I have any  criticism of kindle it is that you cannot easily leaf forward or backward while reading a book.  Unfortunately for me, I do both very often and find that I have to be judicious about the form in which I purchase a book. I clearly made a mistake buying this book in kindle form.
B003MC5N28|3.0|You know, I have heard a lot about this book over the years but for whatever reason have never felt the urge to buy it and read it.<br />Maybe because in the past dystopian has never really been my thing but thanks to some recent great reads (mainly Lauren Oliver's Delirium series) that has changed.<br />So, when I saw this go on sale in ebook form for only $.99 I thought what the heck and picked it up.<br /><br />I really wasn't sure what to expect for this read. I try not to listen to hype about books too much because more often than not, I find myself disappointed with books that have gotten fabulous reviews and well, that just sucks when that happens.<br /><br />So I tried going into this one with an open mind and no expectations whatsoever, which was probably a good thing.<br /><br />I am not going to say that I didn't enjoy this read because I did, I really did. It was imaginative and creative and down right poetic at times but yet...it just didn't grab me like it seemed to for others.<br /><br />It was kind of sad and even a little creepy the extent that the elders and council would go to to keep the Sameness and as the story unfolded you got glimpses of why things were the way they were and the extent of what life was like there.<br /><br />I felt for The Giver and for Jonas and the struggles and challenges that they had with their calling and with them wanting to make their lives better and to open the eyes of the others.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine living in a world devoid of life and emotions and color.<br /><br />How sad that would be.<br /><br />Maybe it was the ending that did it for me, or rather didn't quite do it for me. There really wasn't a definite \\"this is how it is\\" type of thing. You are left wondering if things really changed and what happened with Jonas, The Giver and even baby Gabe. Sometimes I like that definite ending to be there. I don't always want to make up my own happy ever after. And while this did hint at what was to come I just wish it would have been a little more detailed, but then again, this is a trilogy so maybe there is more of that in the next two books. One can only hope at any rate.be there is more of that in the next two books. One can only hope at any rate.
B006ON41FC|4.0|My daughter chooses this game over many other possibilities.  This is probably the best indicator of fun game. She enjoys the challenge of dodging through the trees to collect the acorns and staying away from the owl.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The fact that it reads to you in such a cool voice makes it for me. Plus the layout and use is very simple and well made
B0067Q42BY|4.0|A great game that requires skill. The tutorial is very helpful, too. I like the colors and graphics and the fact that you can do a quest.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Great movie.  All I can say is Gosling was fantastic.  He was sort of creepy because he was so quiet and just watch the movie.  Glad this was not a dud.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the different choices of mini games.  it is a nice way to kill time between my kids piano lessons and soccer practices.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I play with this, whatever it is, for about ten minutes before going to bed. I find it very relaxing, and I sleep very well.  Go Figure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a great app and I was very happy with game quality it was quite a ride I liked ot so much
0783225547|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I have watched it so many times I have no idea how many times I have watched it.  Maybe 20 times at least.  Volcano was okay but I love Dante's Peak.
