B00004BZ0N|5.0|Alright, I'll keep in short. <br /> <br />First, this isn't really a \\"punk record.\\"  The Clash is a punk band, but this isn't their punk album, \\"The Clash\\" or maybe even \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\" is/are their punk album(s).  This album belongs to the entire genre of rock, not just punk.  It's that good. <br /> <br />Second, this is the greatest album of all time.  It takes the punk ethos and translates it into reggae, rockabilly, funk, ska, and well, just draws from a lot of different genres.  It is an incredible rock record that remains poignant and influential to this day. <br /> <br />So if anyone was disappointed by it not being a great punk record, bummer, get \\"The Clash.\\"  For now, listen to \\"London Calling\\" again with an open mind and I think you'll hear why everyone praises it.  And for those that didn't like it for any other reason, well, you should get that looked at by a doctor.
B00005JOQS|5.0|In the realm of superhero films, Richard Donner's SUPERMAN is legendary.  As far as general filmmaking goes, it's a classic.  It is single-handedly responsible for the superhero film.  To this day, it ranks as one of the very finest superhero films ever made, by which all others shall be measured.  Wisely, director Bryan Singer opted not to remake Donner's epic masterpiece.  Instead, he set writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris to work crafting a sort of sequel to SUPERMAN II, ignoring the last two sequels (which had never been too popular with audiences or fans).  The result is SUPERMAN RETURNS. <br /> <br />At the start of the film, a brief blip explains that a group of scientists discovered the remains of the destroyed planet Krypton - which is, of course, Superman's homeworld.  The Man of Steel left his adopted planet behind and set out to investigate these remains, hoping to find one of his own kind.  Five years later, Superman - played by Brandon Routh - returns.  To his shock, things have changed - a lot.  For one thing, his nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from prison.  Also, without Superman, the world's crime rate has gone way up.  The biggest shock of all - Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is married, and has a young son! <br /> <br />I remember that back when McG was helming this film, I was certain that it would fail.  McG, the man who brought us CHARLIE'S ANGELS and CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE, directing a Superman movie?  Please, no!  Though I felt a little better when McG left and Brett Ratner signed on, I was still nervous.  Then, thank the Gods, Bryan Singer - the man behind THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the comic book masterpieces X-MEN and X2 - signed on.  I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief.  The project, I felt, was in good hands. <br /> <br />Was I wrong?  No.  Not at all. <br /> <br />Singer knows what to do and when to do it.  He has an eye for spectacular, thrilling visuals, but can also get great performances from his cast.The action sequences in SUPERMAN RETURNS are some of the most exciting ever filmed.  That's not to say that this is some cheap action flick.  Hardly!  This film is just as moving and emotional as it is thrilling.  The real story of the Superman comics is the love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent.  Bryan Singer realizes this, and makes use of it.  Singer, however, sets Clark off to the side and focuses more on the relationship between Lois and Superman - which has become far more complicated now that Lois is married, and, as Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) points out, \\"a mommy.\\" <br /> <br />One of the big worries of every Superman fan was the casting of Superman himself.  Christopher Reeve, whose portrayal of the Man of Steel is now legendary, was perfect; to countless people, he WAS Superman.  How could anyone hope to fill his shoes?  Wisely, Bryan Singer decided to cast an unknown, just as Richard Donner had done when he made SUPERMAN.  That unknown was Brandon Routh.  And Brandon Routh is amazing.  He is very nearly, maybe even as good as the dear Mr. Reeve.  His performance resembles Reeve's, and yet Routh manages to bring his own touch to the character.  He is truly to be commended for his portrayal of the Man of Steel.  Wonderful. <br /> <br />Then there's Lex Luthor. <br /> <br />Possibly the most famous comic book villain, and undoubtedly one of the most popular villains in history, Lex Luthor is Superman's scheming, brilliant nemesis.  In the 1978-1987 series, he was portrayed by Gene Hackman.  Hackman's portrayal was good, very good, but he seemed a little too jokey and cowardly to me.  Where was the sinister, evil Lex Luthor of the Superman comics?  As I had suspected he would, the magnificent Kevin Spacey brings to life the maniacal, spiteful Lex Luthor of the comic books.  This Lex does not hide beneath the ground, plotting Superman's defeat while suffering his bumbling sidekicks.  Spacey's Lex DOES plot Superman's demise, but he doesso with pure hatred, off to the side, surrounded by violent thugs, and when Luthor finally confronts Superman, he stands there and stares the Man of Steel right in the eye.  You can feel the hatred seeping from Lex Luthor, and from Mr. Spacey. <br /> <br />I feel that Ms. Bosworth is getting some harsh and undeserved criticism from people.  Her Lois Lane is angrier than Margot Kidder's, but she has reason to be.  How could Superman, Earth's savior, just take off and leave Earth's people for five years?  I think that Bosworth is a terrific Lois, and she performs very well with Routh. <br /> <br />The supporting cast includes James Marsden, who also appeared in Singer's X-MEN movies, as Richard White, Lois' fiance.  Marsden's character clearly feels that he is standing in Superman's shadow, but he never comes across as being stuck-up or a jerk; rather, we sympathize with him.  Frank Langella plays Perry White, the clever editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet.  Langella is great, better than Jackie Cooper was in the original Superman movies.  The lovely Parker Posey provides much of the comic relief, replacing Valerie Perrine as Lex Luthor's female accomplice.  Sam Huntington is very funny as young photographer Jimmy Olsen.  Eva Marie Saint appears in the film briefly as Clark's mother.  Interestingly, Saint made her big-screen debut in 1954's ON THE WATERFRONT, opposite Marlon Brando.  Through footage from Richard Donner's SUPERMAN, and unused footage from that film and SUPERMAN II, Brando returns as Jor-El.  It is wonderful to hear his soothing voice again as Superman's wise father.  Also, Jack Larson and Noel Neill, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in the 1950s SUPERMAN TV series, have fun cameos. <br /> <br />One of the things which troubled me during the making of the movie was the music.  John Williams' music for the original series was absolutely flawless, perfect, stupendous, magnificent - one of the greatest film scores of all time.  I was familiar withJohn Ottman's work through THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the X-MEN movies, but that didn't really give me much of an idea what his music for SUPERMAN RETURNS would be like.  I needn't have worried - as Ottman himself says in the liner notes for the soundtrack CD, he was a big fan of Williams' score.  What Ottman has composed is a score that is at once majestic, powerful, heart-pounding, and beautiful.  At the same time, he lets Williams' themes soar when they should.  It's truly a delight.  Should Mr. Williams ever listen to it, I'm sure he would be proud. <br /> <br />Though the plot of SUPERMAN RETURNS is not the most brilliant ever conceived, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.  It is, quite simply, one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  It's a delightful, soaring, romantic adventure that is as charming as any film I've ever seen.  The cast, the script, the directing, the effects, it's all wonderful. <br /> <br />The tagline for the 1978 epic famously proclaimed \\"You'll Believe A Man Can Fly!\\".  After seeing SUPERMAN RETURNS, I believe once more that a man can fly, and I believe that under the control of Bryan Singer, this new series will soar as well.  I am proud to proclaim that Superman, the Man of Steel, Krypton's last son and Earth's saviour, has most certainly returned.
B00005JP5J|5.0|I saw this movie as a sneak preview, and all I have to say is that this movie is by far the funniest and smartest comedy of all time, with a little of \\"National Lampoons Vacation\\" but with the indie charm of \\"You, Me and Everyone We Know,\\" Little Miss Sunshine brings to the screen a heartfelt irony of pain and love with every character presenting a full personality not hollowed or spoiled by cheap antics or bad acting.

B000002L7Y|4.0|amazing cd. simply one of the greatest electronica albums of our time but one of the most underappreciated in the united states.  If you like \\"take on me\\" you'll certainly enjoy this cd, \\"especially blue sky\\", \\"hunting high and low\\", and \\"the sun always shines on tv\\".  Typically this group has been thought of as a one hit wonder, but the songs on this album are all very amazing and whole new music language that is still heard even now in popular electronica.  There is many more great albums released by a*ha that we were huge hits in europe that are must haves if you appreciate the sounds of this short work.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I note that one of my fellow \\"citizen reviewers\\" below felt that this \\"live\\" CD--consisting as it does of live takes of previously recorded songs--was a bit on the superfluous side and would likely appeal only to the \\"casual fan.\\"  Funny thing though,  several others have posted (ironically for similar reasons) that it should only be of interest to Sting COMPLETISTS, the folks who feel compelled to literally  possess every recording the Stingle has ever made.  So who's right?  Neither?  Both?    Well, that likely all depends on the beholder--or the \\"be-hearer.\\" , but I can say that *I* like it a lot.  But if anyone could be classified as definitive casual fan when it comes to Sting, I guess that'd be me.  After a somewhat rocky start with \\"Roxanne\\" (HATED it the first few times I heard it on the radio),  I soon came to appreciate the Police and was intrigued by their intelligent lyrics and tight reggae-influenced rock.  That is to say, I liked what I heard but was never felt compelled to rush out and buy their latest album the day it was released.  And yeah, it did seem that Sting's critics had a point.  He did seem to be a little full of himself, and that put me off at least a little bit.  Had the same complicated reaction to Bono a few years later.  Talented, yes.  Compelling, yes.  Egotistical, yes...but then it's not totally unwarranted.    Years later, I have to ask myself why that was such a sticking point for me.   Why did I always cut Lou Reed or John Lennon considerable slack in the pretentiousness department, but resisted doing the same for those who came a bit later.  Who knows?  What I do know now is that if I had given the Police and Sting's later solo works more of a chance,  I almost certainly would have come to overlook (and maybe even embrace) the minor failings.  There are, as it turns out, more than enough strengths to allow for that.    So anyway this \\"casual fan\\" was familiar with about half the tunes included in this concert album.  I knew thePolice tracks of course,  and certainly remembered early solo stuff like \\"If You Love Somebody, Set Them Free.\\"  Whatever my initial misgivings about \\"Roxanne\\" way back when, I did come to like that song well enough to be a bit disappointed in almost campy version included here.  It's starts off well enough but soon devolves into a near lounge number.  Sorry, but that tune just demands a SINCERE delivery.  And the perfunctory take on \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" is a bit disappointing too.     So maybe Sting is a little uncomfortable by some his efforts of his youthful period?  Or perhaps just tired of them?  He can, however, still wrap himself around the romantic sentiment of \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\\" and captures the still spooky irony of the CD's closer \\"Every Breath You Take\\"  (still  deliciously creepy after all these years).  It's hard to believe that there are those who misunderstand this song's sinister import totally?  I mean, do they really actually play it at WEDDINGS??  Listen to the words, boys and girls.  This is NOT a healthy relationship.    Over the years, Sting has taken a few jabs for his rather overt, matinee idol romanticism.  Well, you either like it or you don't.   Give him credit though: he's smart enough to mix up the lush, metaphysical swoon of \\"A Thousand Years\\" with the comic swagger of \\"Perfect Love Gone Wrong.\\"  That makes for just about the perfect segue and just the right leavening touch.   Similarly, he and the band shift effortlessly from those sunny \\"Fields of Gold\\" to sinister Anne Rice territory with \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street.\\"    The brief notes on the inner sleeve make mention of the fact that the concert this live record documents took place in Italy on September 11, 2001.   The album is \\"respectfully dedicated to those who lost their lives that day.\\"  I suspect many a jaded listener may have been a little skeptical about that.  And there will certainly be those who would maintain that the proper response would have been to cancel the concert and the recording thereof (an evening concert European time would have been just hours after the day's actual events after all.)  Regardless of how you may feel about all that, a genuine spirit of solemnity does indeed permeate many of the tracks.  The album's opener \\"Fragile\\" is eerily poignant in light of the horror of that day.   The song's vaguely wistful pacifist sentiment takes on new significance given the day's carnage.   Five years--and considerably more carnage--later, it still bears listening to.        As does the whole album.  Whether you're a \\"casual fan\\" or a devotee.
B00005JOQS|4.0|As a big fan of the 1978 version of SUPERMAN, I went into this new movie with an open mind.  I saw it in the IMAX 3-D theatre and found the few sequences requiring glasses interesting (although the flashing green symbol certainly tipped everyone off that SOMETHING was going to happen).<br /><br />The three completely animated films in the previews looked better in the 3-D format, to be honest.<br /><br />I thought the movie felt overlong.  I'm not sure how they could've fixed it...but it ran really long.<br /><br />As good as Kevin Spacey is--and as well as he played the part--he just didn't hit the looney but menacing mark that Gene Hackman did.  Hackman's lines were funnier and his anger was more threatening.  And I missed his bellowing cries of \\"MISS TESSMACHEEEEEEEER!\\"<br /><br />I'll bet Hackman could still do it.<br /><br />There were a lot of frequent nods to the original Richard Donner film, which were fun.  The titles and John Williams theme were right out of the first film.  A few notes of \\"Can You Read My Mind?\\" when Lois takes off with Superman.  Snatches of dialogue right out of the first film.  Even Luthor's Krypton Continent scheme is an offshoot of his original daring plan to drop the west coast of the US into the Pacific Ocean (another land grab deal).<br /><br />The special effects were good.  Brandon Routh makes a great Man of Steel (even his wimpy smile as Clark Kent evokes Christopher Reeve).  Bravo for having cameos with the original Lois Lane (Noell Neil) and Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larsen).<br /><br />I love Parker Posey but she never has the femme fatale sexiness of Valerie Perrine.  Ned Beaty's moronic Otis is traded out for a team of mute thugs who add nothing but muscle to the film.  Did they have any lines at all?<br /><br />All the comic book notes are hit and the jumps at drama work all right.<br /><br />I think the film might've really worked better if Superman had someone to confide in.  So much of what he thinks and feels has to be seen through his expressions.  I know they were dead set about using the Marlon Brando footage, but couldn't they have done something so that Superman could converse (and confide) in the long-dead father residing in the crystals?<br /><br />All in all, a good summer movie; no more, no less.<br /><br />Like BATMAN BEGINS last summer, hopefully these franchises will breathe new life into favorite super heroes.expressions.

B00005JN0T|4.0|I just finished watching I, Robot on HBO. I can't vouch for the quality of the picture or sound of this particular DVD, just the storyline. I really enjoyed it. A lot of action, but there is (obviously) a philosophical undertone to the whole film.<br /><br />Purists will probably dislike that the philosophy (and much of the original story) of Isaac Asimov's book takes a backseat to the action. During some scenes, I was thinking: wow, they definitely made a video game about this movie. Much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action, though, contrary to another viewer's opinion, I didn't find the climax \\"stupid.\\" I found it complemented the philosophical aspects of the film, though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action.<br /><br />Parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by Peter Singer, the radical secularist/ professor at Princeton University who advocates infanticide for disabled children. Specifically, this conversation from the film sticks in my mind:<br /><br />\\"You are making a mistake. Do you not see the logic of my plan?\\" To which the reply comes: \\"Yes. But it just seems too...heartless.\\" Essentially, the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process; just cold, detached logic, which sometimes sounds great on paper, but is much less appealing in the real world.<br /><br />In sum, a lot of action, though the philosophical aspect is still very much present (man vs. creator, creator vs. man, the soul, purpose in life,  free will, natural law, conscience and consciousness etc) once you reflect on the film. Mostly action entertainment, but also thought provoking on further review.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|If you read this review, buy the album !!!! <br /> <br />The long awaited second album has had me pacing the floor in anticipation. 6 Months on I am still listening to it regularly, which I have to say is unusal for me as it takes something really special to get my attention.  <br /> <br />To my mind it opens fresh images each time I hear it. The whole concept of the album, though evident in each song, changes daily for me and my mood.  <br /> <br />My favourite track on the album has to be The Kill, Ive never heard any other singer get as much feeling into his singing voice as Jared Letto, the guy is truely amazing. <br /> <br />Buy the album you wont be disappointed !!! <br /> <br />PROVEHITO IN ALTUM.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|When I first heard SOS, I knew straight away that it featured Tainted Love. People say that it solely relies on that to be a great song, but they are wrong. SOS it fantastic in every way, lyrics, voice and of course, the music from Tainted Love.<br /><br />After hearing the second single Unfaithful, I knew that I had to go and buy Rihanna's album, A Girl Like Me, and I was not dissapointed. It features a range of song genres, from pop, to regge, to ballad, and even contains a rock/regge.<br /><br />SOS 100/10 - This is my favorite song EVER. Even after 13 weeks of listening it non stop, I haven't become sick of it. I also love the video clip, which I downloaded and is now on my iPod.<br /><br />Kisses Don't Lie 10/10 - This is my favorite song at this present time (SOS is my ALL time fav song). Great lyrics, beat, and is another I continuley listen to. Should be the 3rd single.<br /><br />Unfaithful 10/10 - I listened it about 3 times before I realized that this was a really good song. I usually don't like ballads, but Rihanna has changed my mind. Good choice as 2nd single.<br /><br />We Ride 9/10 - The chorus is catchy and is a all round good song. It is like the relpy to Unfaithful, if someone else sung it.<br /><br />Dem Haters 9/10 - Fantastic song, but I reckon she could have sung it herself. But none the less, I enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />Final Goodbye 10/10 - Another great ballad with a great chorus. Took time to warm up to it, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Break It Off 9/10 - Good song, but it is more Saun Paul than Rihanna, but I still like it.<br /><br />Crazy Little Thing Called Love 6/10 - An okay song, but not a fav. The music sounds a little like Selfish Girl.<br /><br />Selfish Girl 8/10 - Good song, and I really like the chorus. Everytime I listen to it, I like it more.<br /><br />P.S (I'm Still Not Over You) 8/10 - Only listened to it about 5 times, but I still like it.<br /><br />A Girl Like Me 5/10 - Not a great song. I think it is a bit all over the place, the chorus being the only okay part.<br /><br />A Million Miles Away 7/10 - Another good Ballad. Not my fav song but it is definatley a good one.<br /><br />If It's Lovin That You Want Part 2 4/10 - I liked the original a lot, but I think this was unnecessary and wrecks it. Points only go to the original song. Music sounds like 50 Cent's Candy Shop.<br /><br />Pon De Replay Remix 6/10 - I brought this album in Australia in the shops so I got an extra track. Also unnecessary, but not as bad as If It's Lovin That You Want Part 2.<br /><br />A very good album which I will enjoy listening to for quite some time, and will listen to SOS a whole lot more! Lol.

B00005Q66T|5.0|In 2001, Madonna released her thirteenth album, GHV2: GREATEST HIS VOLUME 2. This album is, obviously, Madonna's second greatest hits compilation. While THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION spanned Madonna's career from 1983 to 1990, GHV2: GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 spans Madonna's career from 1992 to 2001.     DEEPER AND DEEPER (7\\" Edit)    From the 1992 album \\"Erotica\\". This song is still among Madonna's greatest ever. In 2004, Madonna performed this song on her \\"Re-Invention Tour\\", where she performed this song as a 1920's styled cabaret ballad. What an awesome performance it turned out to be.    EROTICA (Radio Edit)    From the 1992 album \\"Erotica\\". Still an awesome dark & sexual song.    HUMAN NATURE (Radio Version)    From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Love this song. I just wish the album version appeared here, instead of the radio version.    SECRET (Edit)    From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Still a classic song.    DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA (Radio Edit)    From the 1996 original motion picture & soundtrack \\"Evita\\". There have been many cover versions of this song over the years, including Donna Summer's version. But no one was able to match the beauty of Madonna's version. Madonna made her version sound as if she was destined to sing this song, as well as portray Eva Perone all along. Beautiful rendition of the \\"Evita\\" classic.    BEDTIME STORY (Edit)    From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Still a classic song with an amazing music video.    THE POWER OF GOOD-BYE    From the 1998 album \\"Ray Of Light\\". Still such an amazing ballad. Love this song.    BEAUTIFUL STRANGER (William Orbit Radio Edit)    From the 1999 original motion picture & soundtrack \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\\". Due the first two Austin Powers film being '60s inspired and influenced, this song fit the Austin Powers sequel so perfectly. What an awesome song this one is.    FROZEN (Edit)    From the 1998 album \\"Ray Of Light\\". Awesome song. Love the instrumenal interlude in the middleof the song.    TAKE A BOW (Edit)    From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Still a beautiful, beautiful ballad.    RAY OF LIGHT (Radio Edit)    From the 1998 album \\"Ray Of Light\\". A song no Madonna fan could refuse to dance or listen to.    DON'T TELL ME    From the 2000 album \\"Music\\". I cannot get tired of listening to this song. I love it.    WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL    From the 2000 album \\"Music\\". Another awesome song.    DROWNED WORLD / SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE    From the 1998 album \\"Ray Of Light\\". Still a great ballad.    MUSIC    From the 2000 album \\"Music\\". They saved the danciest for last. I still cannot refuse the opportunity to be on the dance floor when this song is being played. An amazing song.    GHV2: GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 gives us the best of Madonna's career from 1992 to 2001. The only thing that disappoints me is the absence of \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\", & \\"Nothing Really Matters\\". Other than the non-inclusion of those three songs, this album is definitely worth having.
B0006IF92U|5.0|This is a great album from my fav artist. Best song on it is Mistaken Identity, and even after about a year and a bit, I still listen to it. I also like Last Night On Earth and Electric Storm, which are both fantastic. Highly Recommended.

6305736650|4.0|I originally saw this movie on TV for the first time over a year ago and I was so drawn to it. This is one of the Few B&W movies that I do own now. I just cant get over the power of this film. I feel allot of present day films dont have this kind of magic that makes it jump off the screen. The characters are real by the performances of the actors, the direction and the writing is solid. Thier are so many sources that have drawn from this movie. You just cant help but appreciate the source material. Its very rare everything just works.<br /><br />This is a classic that should never have been remade because its impossible. From the short clips from the documentary it was rather transparent that most of those were just bad imitations .<br /><br />  The Film has a wonderful mix of Humor, Drama and Romance even most guys can even appreciate. Its not mushy ...which is a relief.  And it all works togethor. A sense of history involved with refugees leaving Nazi Occupied France which most films about that era shy away from. Casablanca has had more tributes done to it than they have mentioned.<br /><br />This is one of the first movies I've seen Humphrey Bogart in and I cant see anyone else in the part. I've enjoyed him in \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". Two of his Co stars from the Maltese Falcon both have roles in the film Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. The chemistry works not just with these characters and their relationship with Rick. Ricks relationship with Capt. Renault I find the basis for allot of things I've seen before but this came first. And I can appreciate that.<br /><br /> Even if its redone again it just will not work. The actors bring something to that performance that makes the film unique. It cannot be repeated. The overall feel of the film cannot be recaptured.  This film is a big example why classic films should not be remade.<br /><br />My only complaints have been that the sound quality on the DVD is OK . Its not bad but I had to turn my TV all the way up to get that Stereo Theatre feeling. I'm a wide screen freak and the film is in Pan and Scan. I don't know if it was my player or just the movie over the sound quality. The Documentary is really a joy to watch though.ot bad but I had to turn my TV all the way up to get that Stereo Theatre feeling. I'm a wide screen freak and the film is in Pan and Scan.

0375413405|5.0|I have always enjoyed cooking, but had never read this book.  I thought that traditional French cooking would be difficult to master, high in fat and unnecessarily time-consuming.  Also -- I'm an Italian-American -- I thought that Hazan was the last word in cooking.  Boy, was I wrong.    A few months ago, my teenage son returned from his first trip abroad raving about the meals that he'd had in Paris.  I knew from experience how great those meals could be and, to please him and provide my family with a new dinner experience, I bought \\"Mastering\\" and tried a few recipes.  I am now totally hooked.  Julia's recipes are clear, well-organized and easy to follow.  The book is exquisitely -- and logically -- organized, with each section beginning with a master recipe and continuing through several variations on that theme.  This method of organization teaches the structure as well as the ingredients of each recipe, thus encouraging further experimentation by the reader.  In other words, by following the recipes, you learn to cook. (Having recently read \\"My Life In France,\\" I now know that this was Child's intention: \\"Mastering\\" took years to write, with each recipe tested and refined many times.)      Some recipes contain too much butter or cream for modern diets, but these recipes may be easily modified.  The techniques, however, are flawless:  my pie crust was flaky and did not shrink; the ratatouille (which is low in fat) was perfect and beautiful; the swordfish provencale was so good that my son, who never eats leftovers, ate the leftovers cold out of the refrigerator.  Indeed, the pastry dough recipe works so well that, after turning it out into the pan, I exclaimed aloud, \\"Julia Child is brilliant!\\", much to the surprise of my plumber, who was working in the house at the time and had walked into the kitchen to ask about a leak.  In sum, if you have been afraid of this book, don't be, and if you think that it has become dated or irrelevant -- a mere collector's item -- you are very wrong.  I still love Hazan, but \\"Mastering\\" is the master class.
1400077915|5.0|This is my first experience with Alice Munro but it will not be the last I can assure you.  Ms. Munro can take a story that wouldn't interest anybody and make it seem as if the world depends on the conclusion.  Simple people in everyday situations that occur everywhere.  Ms. Munro gets to the heart of situations and expresses things that truly matter to people.
1400062071|5.0|If you're seeking a nuanced and tender character study coupled with a page-turning plot, look no further than Elizabeth's Strout's latest. What a beautifully conceived and heartfelt novel. Reading ABIDE WITH ME provided me with several hours of exquisite pleasure.
0062502182|2.0|This novel had an intriguing cover and the glowing reviews on the back and inside front covers had me eager to get home and dive into this offering by Paulo Coelho.<br /><br />However the result was a resounding disappointment...let me explain<br /><br />1.)The Introduction;<br /><br />Red flags began waving when I read the introduction of this book with the author stating<br /> a.) that he saw photographs of both President Bill Clinton and actress Julia Roberts, showing them  reading this book and<br /> b.) that he, (the author) could not really understand why this book sold 20 million copies world wide.<br /><br />Somehow, tooting one's own horn and a hint of phony self depreciation in the introduction has a way of getting things started off on the wrong foot.<br /><br />2.)The Story:<br /><br />This is a touchy-feely-warm-and-fuzzy-all-over novel. If life enhancing, moralistic novels are your thing, you may really like this work. This book was just not what I'd expected.<br /><br />3.)The intended audience;<br /><br />The writing is really at an adolescent level. I could imagine this novel being picked out to be read for a youth-camp discussion group as there are some values here that might be useful to the younger reader, however, I would think that most adults would be far beyond the elementary teachings of this book. I guess this is why I find it hard to understand the reasons that  many other readers can justify giving it 5 stars (or even 4 stars for that matter). Maybe something was lost in the translation, however, I cannot help but stop to wonder how these readers would rate a truly great book...if in fact they'd ever recognize one.<br /><br />This story was not what I'd hoping or looking for; undoubtedly many people will find this book engaging and a joy to read. However, I must agree with the authors statement in the intro... I find it hard to believe this effort has actually sold 20 million copies.  1 1/2 - 2 Stars.

B00005JNRY|3.0|*Note - As many times, when the film is considered a \\"kid's\\" film, I watch my two children's reactions to the film.  10-yrs & 8-yrs...    As I viewed Cars, I was stunned at how beautiful and amazing computer animation has become.  It has evolved from a novelty, to truly a beautiful form of art.  Cars, especially the scenery, was visually amazing...AMAZING!!!    However...    I noticed my children fidgeting throughout the film.  I could tell that they were losing interest rather quickly.  I did not see them laughing out loud with any frequency.  Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in the popcorn, rather than the film.  Afterwards I asked them how they liked the film and they just shrugged their shoulders.  There was never a moment that one could really feel sorry for Lightning McQueen or emphasize with him.  He was arrogant and self-serving as Chick Hicks was, although not as nasty...    Cars failed in one major way that the other Pixar/Disney films succeeded in...Cars failed to have characters that my children (or my wife or I) cared about.  They were funny, but we did not feel emotionally invested in anyone.  Pixar, up until now, always had films that had great stories first and great graphics was a bonus.  This seemed that they put the graphics first and the story second.    One other thing...if you are not a big racing fan, which my wife and two children are not, many of the jokes and cameos will go right over your head...thank goodness for Mater...
0393327655|4.0|This is an excellent book for anyone interested in an ontological debate. Mr. Harris provides a somewhat unscholarly yet extraordinarily effective discourse on faith, religion and it's inherent problems in the twenty-first century. It must be noted that Mr. Harris' is more a book of Philosophy rather than science, and as such is not flawless. However, in my humble estimation, readers who rate this book one or two stars are somewhat misguided.  <br /> <br />The question Mr. Harris raises most often is the question of religious infallibility. Mr. Harris states that tolerance cannot be afforded in this day and age with religion. I believe he's making more a reference to religious dogma. This is where Mr. Skiff, a critic of this book whom posted below, is misguided. Organized religion, more often than not, is dogmatic. Many religions will claim infallibility.  <br />To say that religion is inclusive is, in my opinion, anecdotal and subjective. My first year political science professor has quite a few friends who are Russian Orthodox. His friends constantly remind him to join their faith lest be cast into the fires of hell with the rest of the non-believers.  <br />I also often recount a confessional session I had with my high school's priest when I was 16 or 17. I told him I was losing my faith. He replied if catholicism didn't suit me, then I was free to try other peaceful religions. This, in my opinion, is not what Mr. Harris is fighting against. My school's priest seemed to admit, without openly saying so, that religion isn't flawless.  <br />However Harris' general target are those that find their religion infallible and are thus captured into circular reasoning. I am also often recounting Plato's \\"Euthyphro\\" in which the reasoning went something like \\"X action is good because God loves X action, and God loves X action because it is good.\\" Which begs the question, if the first case were true, then God's will becomes arbitrary and if the second were true then that would be goodness is something measured independant of God. <br /> <br />From my recollection Sam Harris doesn't openly attack moderates as ferverously as devouts or extremists. However, he does mention that as science and reason further themselves in our society, our religious faith declines. This, as Harris states, can be seen through numerous accounts through history. The end of the Spanish Inquisition, the rise or germ theory and anti-septics and so forth. Previously illnesses were seen as acts of God. (Trial by fire anyone?). That aspect of faith is becoming broken as we gain further knowledge. Our lack of knowledge is represented by faith. <br /> <br />The problem with religious fundamentalism is if we don't look at the possibilities of religious conflict as becoming, once again, a cause people are willing to lay their lives down for, it begs the question: What of this life?  <br /> <br />I am a secular humanist who believes religion serves a purpose but religious dogma poisons its foundations. I get the feeling Harris is a humanist but is somewhat more extreme and this is where he fails.  <br />In the Soviet Union, which was the epitomy of all things secular, transformed churches into power generators and the like. When Soviet soldiers were fighting on the eastern front, a portion of the men fighting had very poor morale and low spirits. The Soviet Union was a beacon for religion prior to the coup of the Czar. The rural population were usually religious and didn't understand secularism. These were the men who were in the ranks of the soviet army. Yet, they fought better with preists (I forget the technical term) in the ranks. So there is something that speaks about the spirituality of humanity that may not be uncovered by reason any time soon.

0786852550|4.0|Primarily for: Teens <br /> <br />Nathaniel was raised by a minor minister in an alternate London in a time not long past. He was acquired at the age of five for a large sum of money, and fostered out to the minister and his wife in order to learn magic. By age eleven he is well beyond his studies, and filled with the cocky pride that is his downfall when magician Simon Lovelace chooses to make an example of him. Publicly humiliated, Nathaniel decides to summon a demon to steal Lovelace's greatest treasure. <br /> <br />Enter Bartimaeus, a snarky djinni with his own opinions and plenty of attitude. Bartimaeus may be reduced to serving Nathaniel's commands (or suffer Indefinite Confinement in a tobacco tin at the bottom of the Thames), but that doesn't mean he's happy about it. Magicians are notorious for putting djinni and other spirits in all sorts of uncomfortable spots to do their bidding--weaving them into carpets, locking them in scrying mirrors--and causing them to risk grave injury. Nathaniel's just another magician with a stronger death wish than usual. At first. <br /> <br />Before long, the commoners' Resistance is involved, plots are discovered, and things go from bad, to worse, to worse still. Through it all, Nathaniel remains determined to do the right thing--even while whining about the consequences. Despite his facade of indifference, Bartimaeus saves him again and again--until they reach the worst of all. <br /> <br />After closing this book, I was left with plenty of questions about this odd world. What defines a magician, besides specialized training and a very odd upbringing? What are the Resistance really up to? What are the countries outside of England like, particularly those decadent Prague wizards? As this is the first in a trilogy, I suspect I can read on to find out.

0465043550|4.0|Orthodox economics is very formal using complex models to predict future behaviour. Most economists, like meteorologists, are not held accountable for their predictions.<br /><br />Within the very wide field of economics there are many conflicting views about the nature of economics and there is much in the way of interesting work going on out there and I would cite the contributions of the Austrian school and the evolutionary school and especially point to the very accessible work of Paul Ormerod who give somewhat different views to those of the standard model.<br /><br />This book is not aimed at those practitioners of economics or indeed the professionals of the City of London or Wall Street. To my mind, as an interested observer, Mandelbrot  and Hudson are doing all of us a service in illuminating the gaps in economic theory that underpins the financial industry. John Maynard Keynes, who's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)can be said to lie at the heart of much of contemporary economic theory, once famously compared the financial services industry to gambling, also made his fortune on the stock market.<br /><br />The book methodically disects each of the pillars of contemporary financial theory and exposes it's weakness then introduces some basic fractal geometry ideas to exhibit their apparent ly better predictive use. As someone who favours the approach of ideas of chaos theory into the economics brew I tend to be more open to the approach that Mandelbrot uses but the proof of the pudding, as we say in England, lies in the eating and this populist text is certainly not the place for complex technical proofs or highly mathematical analysis. It is a difficult path to take but for the purposes for which this book is intended, which I believe is aimed at the educated investor or someone without an economics or financial background, it is about right.<br /><br />I found the book both accessible and lucid. There are areas with which I would have wished for a more techical exposition but this is something that I will take up when I delve further into this subject matter.<br /><br />There are many interesting ideas here and I suspect that there are many in the financial services community who are looking into these in greater detail or even have already absorbed them into their toolkit. Given the competitive nature of the financial markets I suspect that this knowledge will quickly be dispesed throughout the community.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice easy read which will prompt further thought and study upon it's contents. My only, minor reservation, which prevents me awarding five stars is that I think a non-technical appendix, in keeping with the rest of the book, about the basic precepts of fractal geometry would have been helpful for the lay reader.<br /><br />Well worth a look.ould have wished for a more techical exposition but this is something that I will take up when I delve further into this subject matter. <br /> <br />There are many interesting ideas here and I suspect that there are many in the financial services community who are looking into these in greater detail or even have already absorbed them into their toolkit.

B0002W18MU|5.0|Few artists in American music have been as original as Johnny Cash was.  Few artists in American music have been as brutally honest as Johnny Cash was.  This album represents both of those facets to the extreme.  American V may be the best of the series produced by Rick Rubin.  It shows a man at his most vulnerable physically but still in love with the art that propelled him through his many ups and downs in life.  This album confronts death with a nudge and a wink as if to say, \\"I know your there my sickle bearing old friend but I'm going to keep rowing this boat until the end.\\"  At least that's what I imagine Johnny saying with this powerful round of songs.  It on one hand forces one to think of their own life while on the other rejoice in the power to simply sustain.  Johnny was lucky to have spent his remaining years producing the kind of music he wanted to and we have all been richly rewarded with five (soon to be six) albums that simultaneously celebrate the man and his life and serve as a reminder to us all that truly great artists have more to give than they may ever have the life span to produce.<br /><br />The album starts off with the touching Help Me.  It's hard to hear Johnny sound so frail but at the same time the song successfully resonates his pain and gives a hint at the overall theme of the album.  God's Gonna Cut You Down might just be the best song ever recorded in the years he worked with Rick Rubin.  It nullifies, in my opinion, the arguments that Johnny not being present to approve of the musical arrangements was some sort of unethical act on the part of Rubin and the other musicians.  The instrumentation on this song is perfect and adds power to the words and message being conveyed.  In fact, I can't fault anyone associated with this release with regards to the arrangements.  Johnny was richly rewarded by his association with Rubin and together they struck a friendship and trust that endured till the end.  I don't think many producers would have given of their time so freely as Rubin did and I think Johnny recorded the vocals realising someone would have to add the final touches.  Johnny recorded these songs to be heard and I highly doubt he would have wanted them to be released without music to back them up.  Frankly I find that whole argument to be ridiculous.<br /><br />Like The 309 was his last song but it amazes me how this song resembles his early works.  You can imagine what it would have sounded like in his youth with his original band.  It's a true Cash original and brings to mind a form of American songwriting we will never see again, especially with the utter trash that modern Country artists are producing now.  Next comes If You Could Read My Mind, a Gordon Lightfoot original, that in many ways stays true to the original feel of the song.  Johnny's covers always managed to bring out the true nature of what the songs really were.  I had always thougt NIN's version of Hurt was pretty good, but when I heard Johnny cover it I was even more impressed by it.  It amazes me how much over production can sometimes mask the great song that has been written.  While nothing should be taken away from Lightfoot's version, it was great, however, Johnny's version could sit on the same bookshelf with it quite easily.<br /><br />The rest of the songs on this album continue to flow easily and two more standouts include Love's Been Good To Me and A Legend In My Time.  Both are necessary because they serve to break up a little of the sadness present on this album with a bit of humor.  I don't think Johnny meant for this album to be a reflection of life in general since he recorded many songs in succession but Rubin's selection of material for inclusion on this album helped make it seem that way.  I feel like I will always cherish this album just as I know Cash cherished recording it.  I don't know if any other album that comes out this year will be as amazing and I know for sure none will be as personal.  Thank you Johnny for this gift, and thank you Rick Rubin for wrapping this gift up so beautifully.Thank you Johnny for this gift, and thank you Rick Rubin for wrapping this gift up so beautifully.
B000A59PMO|5.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is one of the best shows I've seen in a while.  The writing manages to balance humor, romance, and drama perfectly and the entire cast, down to bit players, is top notch.  As a big fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", this show has really filled a void for me in terms of smart, funny, moving shows featuring a strong, engaging central female character. <br /> <br />The DVD of Season 1 is a little disappointing in terms of extras (just a few deleted scenes), but it's great to have all of the episodes collected in one place.  In light of the season-long mystery's conclusion, it's nice to be able to look back for clues you might have missed and it's also interesting to see the season in a different light, given what you know after the finale.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I am in the small minority of people who believe that Amnesiac is their best album.<br /><br />'The Bends' was very consistent and enjoyable, but none of the songs were 'absolute masterpieces'<br /><br />'OK Computer' was good - it DID have some absolute masterpieces, but also a couple of tracks that I do not like very much<br /><br />'Kid A' is also very good, but songs such as 'The National Anthem', 'Treefingers', and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' slightly let the album down.<br /><br />Amnesiac is consistent, and features some of my all-time favourite songs.<br /><br />\\"Packd like sardines crushd in a tin box\\" is this albums \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" - it was composed on a drum n bass machine, and combined with the guitars and so on, the song is a mixed media and atmospheric and creative masterpiece. The lyrics are at an all-time weird and original as well, and this is one of the few electronic Radiohead songs on this album, as it is quite more acoustic than Kid A. definitely one of my top-5 Radiohead songs. \\"Pyramid Song\\" follows, and I am shocked how a track so unusual, with an even weirder time signature could hit #5 in the UK - this just shows how the band had developed a strong fan base with their past 3 albums especially. The song is dense and thick, and builds up into an amazing climax, which makes this song my favourite Radiohead song. Period. The piano is one of the 'main' instruments - it is very art/rock. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" is another cool song, that is completely electronic, and I think this is one of the two songs Radiohead that have recorded that are completely electronic. I had a headache the first time I heard this song, but the reason why I like it so much now is because of its distinct originality. It is very alternative, and in my opinion the weirdest Radiohead song - ever. It is unlike anything I have ever heard and anything Radiohead have ever recorded for that matter. The song is extremely distorted - you can not understand the vocals, which raises the question of why there are no lyrics in the album booklet! Far more than half of time I can not understand wtf Thom Yorke is saying - the vocals are either distorted, or he is singing unclearly although it is usually a combination of both.<br /><br />\\"You And Whose Army\\" is another of my favourites. The first two minutes or so are incredibly atmospheric, before this piano riff is heard, and the song builds up into a loud and accessible climax - which is why I like this song so much. The lyrics are at their most metaphorical. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is the first song that does not feature any electronica or piano. It is your 'classic' Radiohead rock song. It is quite catchy also it was stuck in my head for days - and still is. The song follows the distorted-vocals-unclear-lyrics trend, of all of the previous tracks. \\"Knives Out\\" was the second and last single, peaking at #13 in the UK. Another song that has no electronica or mixed media, but is not as good as any of the tracks so-far - it wouldn't have felt out of place on The Bends, and to a lesser extent OK Computer. \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is my least favourite song. The original Kid A version is far better, and my favourite part (walking, walking, walking walking...) is cut!!! The things I enjoyed most about the original was the 7/8 time signature, unusual drum pattern, and my favourite part, as mentioned above, and all of these things are not seen in this song. The time signature is now something like 2/2, and this is kind of like a more relaxed and laid-back version of the original. It still isn't BAD though. \\"Dollars And Cents\\" returns to the quality of the first four tracks. The verses are very dark and mysterious, and the bridge quickly builds up to the fantastic chorus, and makes an excellent climax. This is another very unusual song, with violins and such, synths, and a 'cool' beat.<br /><br />\\"Hunting Bears\\" is a short interlude, which features an electric guitar playing notes, and this is followed by the amazing \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", which is probably Radiohead's most inaccessible song that I have heard (I heard and read that the b-sides are much weirder by the way) and is quite minimalistic at points. The song starts, and you hear something that sounds like plates spinning. Soon after the texture dramatically thickens, and the song becomes much more darker and claustrophobic. Thom sounds like he is drunk and can hadrly piece two words together, and you first hear him after a two minute or so intro (the song goes for around four minutes I think - the lyrics are 'backwards' so to speak as well), and the song turns into a haunting, majestic and above all strange song. \\"Life In A Glasshouse\\" is a song just as good as the latter. It experiments with jazz in rock, and I hope that the band experiment with brass etc more in the future.<br /><br />The average review is 4 stars, but what you just remember is that the album gorws on you. I must admit I was one of the people that thought the only good song was 'Pyramid Song' when I first listened to the album. As I gradually 'got to know' the other, I realized what a masterpiece this album actually is. It flows excellently, and as I said in the title, and the first paragraph, this is the bets Radiohead album. It is also the strangest, the most out-there and the most rewarding.<br /><br />10 / 10by the amazing \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", which is probably Radiohead's most inaccessible song that I have heard (I heard and read that the b-sides are much weirder by the way) and is quite minimalistic at points.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Several careful listens to Ghost Reveries should suffice to see Opeth's move to Roadrunner Records hasn't changed or affected their musical vision the least bit. I've played this disc seemingly hundreds of times and each spin cements my opinion that this is still a great Opeth album that gets better and better. So if you put off checking it out because of some people claiming they \\"sold out\\", I urge you to think again and buy this album and form your own opinion.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries is one of the most varied albums in Opeth's catalog, displaying a rich compositional style blended with passionate songwriting and stylistic cohesion. I cannot stress the \\"passionate\\" part, as some of the songs are among the most haunting and emotive Mikael Akerfeldt has written. While the band had plenty of time to rehearse and perfect the material on Ghost Reveries, there were also songs that were recorded in one take or even put together in the studio. The compositions are very organic from start to finish, and the addition of keyboard player Per Wiberg only serves to add more dimension to their music as opposed to influence their direction in a negative way.<br /><br />Speaking of Wiberg, some of the songs on the album are very much accommodating, as they allow Wiberg to pull out ever-colourful synth sounds, blazing organs, grand and electric piano, and the Mellotron. Though his presence isn't as prevalant on the heavier cuts such as \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" and \\"The Grand Conjuration\\", there is still a solid wall of synth sound built around the relentless riffing and demonic death metal growls. \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", a terrific choice to open the album, also sees Opeth taking on some distinct Tool influences, particularly in the syncopated rhythm guitars and eerie percussion work. The guitar tuning and some of the chord progression evoke Tool's \\"The Grudge\\", which is no big surprise considering Akerfeldt has always cited Tool among his favourite bands. The other heavy number \\"The Grand Conjuration\\", on the other hand, highlights the band's technical proficiency, with an epic arrangement and very fast yet well-written lead solo. Akerfeldt's vocals on this song are among his best in his career.<br /><br />\\"Baying of the Hounds\\" is arguably the finest cut on the album, introducing 70's organ sounds contrasted by great transitions and awesome clean vocal harmonies. Lopez' drumming on this track is sublime while Wiberg's keyboard acrobatics culminate in a somewhat avant-garde instrumental break which is then followed by an interplay between blazing guitar solos and thundering rhythms. The piece features some of the best lyrics on this album and is impressively finalised with a climactic ending. Also, note that the title of this song was actually inspired by the lyrics of Comus' 1970 debut First Utterance, namely the opening song \\"Diana\\": \\"The dim light she comes peering through the forest pines / And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds\\".<br /><br />The heavy and softer parts contrasted on \\"Beneath the Mire\\", which is actually one of the hidden gems, show a unique development of ideas, implemented with maturity. Wiberg's Mellotron is central to this number, while Mendez' bass takes on a slightly funk vibe halfway through, rendering it his most powerful performance on the album. The guitar preceding the tranquil piano section is out of this world while Opeth's love for 70's prog is best exhibited during the last thirty seconds where odd sound effects are married with awesome drumming and clean harmonies, which, strangely enough, evoke Still Life to me. Another track that bears a Still Life resemblance, not musically but based on its progression, is the aforementioned \\"Baying of the Hounds\\" in the way that is has a similar recklessness to it.<br /><br />While all eight songs on the album are amazing in their own way, \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" deserves a special mention. The longest song, it serves as an anchor to glue the first half of the album to the relatively moodier and somewhat more laidback second half (with the exception being the obvious \\"The Grand Conjuration\\"). This song has Akerfeldt's best vocal harmonies, starting with the \\"A trail of sickness leading to me\\" part at the beginning, where harrowing growls provide dynamics that make this piece so sinister, and ending with the slightly folky chorus that goes like, \\"It is all false pretension...\\", which, yet again, precedes a thunderingly brutal scream whilst numbing guitar drills and beautiful melodies surround everything.<br /><br />The two mellow songs, criticised severely by some, \\"Hours of Wealth\\" and \\"Isolation Years\\", actually make an immense contribution to the varied nature of Ghost Reveries. Actually you may be as surprised as I was that \\"Hours of Wealth\\" is a song whose vocals Akerfeldt did in one take and felt the need to defend in several interviews and even his own official forum (something he very rarely does), while he admitted being literally in tears singing \\"Isolation Years\\". The former also features a devastasting blues solo and even some a capella vocals and ranks among Opeth's most diverse pieces; whilst \\"Isolation Years\\", despite seeming rather simplistic at face value, makes subtle switches between 5/8 and 6/8 beats.<br /><br />Opeth has never disappointed me. Ghost Reveries is a very solid addition to their discography; it still retains every element that made Opeth so great in the past while also embracing a wider and more diverse expression of artistic integrity.tively moodier and somewhat more laidback second half (with the exception being the obvious \\"The Grand Conjuration\\").

B0007M22TI|5.0|I caught the performance on my local PBS station and was absolutely blown away.  I just had to buy the DVD.  Chloe, Lisa, Meav and Orla have some of the beautiful voices I have ever heard.  Combining this with Mairead's musical gift brought the entire thing together for a phenomenal performance.  From the start you are mesmerized by the sounds of angelic voices and beautiful music; you just wished it would go on and on.
B000F8DT4Q|4.0|Well, I would have given this a full \\"Five\\" star review but as a collector of their work with everything from vinyl to CD, I can't understand WHY they put the single version of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" when it's the same as the album version?! Anyway, they could have used the U.S.12\\" remix of this track instead of wasting time on the same track twice. Other then that, a great addition in which I had all the original sources and all collected together for this double CD set. I also recommend picking up the all there CD's up to \\"Sowing The Seeds Of Love\\" & the others if you really get into this band. I am also on the web which you search \\"Judemac Forever\\" on msn.

0743490304|1.0|This book borders on the incredulous and halfway through I almost put it down, because the events passed the \\"point\\" of believability.<br /><br />I enjoyed all of Dan Brown's other books and expected this to be of the caliber of DIGITAL FORTRESS, but found it sorely lacking.  I would rate all the others  5 STARS but suggest you pass this one by.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is representative of Johnny Cash's life, depicting the rise to stardom and its consequences, as well as brief points about his childhood and, later on, his drug addiction and martial problems. Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships. While the die-hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner \\"Crash\\").  <br /> <br />The most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted. Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity. Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky. However, Witherspoon successfully makes this role complex and deep, not just one-dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success. Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was \\"Jackson\\").  <br /> <br />The film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music. Although this part of the film is perhaps too short (what can you do in only two hours), we understand the heavy guilt that plays a role in Johnny's life for the loss of his brother during his younger years. We also see the riff between him and his father, with Johnny seemingly feeling like the \\"other\\" son much of the time, and being unable to please him. Johnny derives interest in gospel music, but, when he is told that that won't sell, he pulls out a song he when inspiration hit, \\"Folsom City Blues\\" (Cash will later play in Folsom County Jail after he gets tons of fan mail after writing that song).  <br /> <br />If there is one negative, it is that perhaps there is too much time spent on Cash's drug addiction. Maybe more of this could have been spent focusing on some of his younger years or the later years.  <br /> <br />However, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.
1577311523|3.0|The idea of \\"the now\\" can be difficult to grasp intellectually. Tolle's experiential approach attempts to help us avoid the tendency to overanalyze everything that challenges our present reality. Although I personally consider this basic reading material, for the beginner it provides a path from everyday consciousness into awakening. I recommend Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn in lieu of (or as a supplement to) The Power of Now It is more concise and covers the same idea.
0345440900|5.0|I read this book while I was pregnant, and again when my son was born, and had a difficult time napping and getting off to sleep at night.  It was a helpful guide, which is what ANY baby book should be, and it gave me some ideas on how to get my son to sleep on his own, without letting him cry (I do think the cry it out method is cruel)  What Tracy advocates, and I wholeheartedly agree, is to GET TO KNOW YOUR BABY above all else.  The EASY plan worked pretty well with my son, but I've adapted it a little; he doesn't always sleep in his crib for naps, as long as he is getting a healthy amount of sleep, we don't mind where he falls asleep.  Also, I don't watch the clock, I watch HIM, and just try to anticipate his needs before he gets frantic(this is my problem with demand feeding...I don't like the idea of waiting until he is so hungry that he cries...why not just watch his cues and feed him while he's happy???)  I don't understand people's complaint about the breastfeeding stuff.  I am breastfeeding, but not on demand...my son has been going every 2-3 hours since birth.  Sometimes, he gets hungry sooner, sometimes later, but I have the sense enough to just feed him, not just follow the 'orders' of a book.  Come on, people...no book is going to give you a cure all to your baby's crying, sleeping and eating, you do have to use a little commom sense, and get to know this little person.  At 5 weeks old, my baby is not sleeping through the night...and I don't need him to be just yet; he's well rested, happy, and gaining weight like a champ...all because I used Tracy's book, and my own instinct!!!
0743455967|5.0|Who knew that popular horror writer Stephen King appreciates the high brow, literary side of the writing craft? Who knew that in his early days, he taught a college course on writing? In this book, King combines an autobiography written in a coarse style with literary criticism and his summary of the fundamentals of good writing. If you are interested in the literary craft, this is a helpful book. Easy, fascinating reading and insightful, though a bit disjointed. Worth your time.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is a hard film to watch. We tend to shun the attention around this disgusting theme. Africa is irremissibly, the hopeless and no future continent.<br /><br />And the movie, based on the famous John Le Carre's novel shows us many people consider this region of the planet as a huge field for experimentation, due the statistics may minimize, hide or even transfigure the most awful reality, in the name of any label, belief or ideology you wish imagine. Its undeniable potentialities have always been a succulent motive of greed; you may think in diamonds, raw material for nuclear weapons or even become a living laboratory for testing new technological devices, because after all, who really cares if any native from this continent might die?<br /><br />The strange deaths of many countrymen in Nairobi will be the dramatic core of this intriguing, brave and lugubrious portrait about a chilling reality. Potent script, bravura performances from all the cast, and a very interesting camera handle, that combines elements that featured the cinema verit&eacute; (with the camera on the shoulders, remarking the dramatic vision through nervous displacements), wondrous narrative ellipsis and formidable traveling, ravishing photography and emblematic close ups.<br /><br />To my mind one the twelve best movies of 2005 around the world!
B00004RFFI|4.0|What a terrific movie! Will Smith and Jeff Goldbloom make a super team. \\"Independence Day\\" keeps you glued to you seat even if you have seen it several times. If it's not making laugh with witty remarkes, you hold your breath when the heroes face the enemy, or the special effects that make you really sit up and take notice of this great movie. \\"Independence Day\\" is a must own for everyone.
0765315246|5.0|This novel almost begs for comparison to Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" and Haldeman's \\"Forever War.\\"  For a first novel, it is amazingly good.  But I think it has one structural flaw, and another flaw from the point of view of science fiction. <br /> <br />As far as plot goes, the novel is fantastic up until the point when the hero actually starts seeing combat.  At that point, it seems to lose focus a bit, becoming episodic, and drifting from one combat situation to another until it picks up the thread again towards the end.  One doesn't get too much sense of how humanity fits into the universe, or how the army fits into the human sphere. <br /> <br />Once the Special Forces are introduced, things accelerate; but the rationale of the book begins to seem a bit strained.  To put it simply:  if the Special Forces are so much better than the Regulars, what are the Regulars for?  Why recruit 75-year-olds, when it seems that with equal effort one can create even better soldiers from nothing more than a genetic sample?  This is never explained, and it left me rather unsatisfied.  I hope this gets cleared up in the sequel, and the nature of Scalzi's universe is made more clear. <br /> <br />In spite of this criticism, however, I enjoyed the novel very much, and would strongly recommend it to any fan of military SF.

1400032717|5.0|I'm busy -- overscheduled.  So when I sit down to read a book, I want escape and entertainment.  Enlightenment is acceptable but often accidental.  Curious Incident well exceeded my hopes and expectations.  It IS harsh, but when it catapulted me into the world of a sixteen year old boy with autism -- a new light went on.  I have no personal experience or association with anyone struggling with this misalignment of intellect to senses, and yet I connected.  I understood and saw the extreme logic of his reactions, even found pieces of myself in Christopher.  Curious Incident took me forever more out of judgement of or pity toward anyone living with autism.  It transported me to another world, another consciousness of being that is not a mythical fantasy world, not a faraway exotic land or culture -- but a boy walking down my street.  I strongly recommend this book -- most especially to those who enjoy mind travel.
0671027573|4.0|What can you say but that the hero Sam is dangerous, sexy, and a little rough around the edges. I loved how his character was portrayed, Kudos to you Linda.Janie and Sams interaction together was sexy and I loved the shots they seemes to take at each other. The water scene with the hose was great. I enjoyed this book very much, the plot was interesting (the list) and the interaction between the women. I so enjoy Howards work and this was no exception.
0743490304|4.0|The funny thing about this book is that I didn't even realize I liked it (I actually thought a little disfavorably of it) until I finished it. Ok, let me explain. This being the third Dan Brown book I read, I went into it expecting the same \\"wow-factor\\" effect you get from reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons that makes you want to go look something up online at two a.m. to see if it's true. Because that isn't in this book as much as it is in the others, I started to think that I wasn't liking it as much as I wanted myself to when I began. Despite this, I was very into the book and couldn't stop reading because the plot had sucked me in and I really wanted to find out the explanation for the mystery in the ice (which is the premise of the whole book) and wanted to see if Brown could pull off a believable explanation. I was pleasantly surprised after finished this book because before starting it I thought I would love it, a quarter of the way through I got worried, half way through I started to dislike it, and at the end I thought it was pretty good and was happy I read it. All in all, a good book will not dissapoint if you're a Brown fan.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|If you are looking for songs as catchy as Crazy you won't find them here.  It is one of the best uptempo songs I've heard from a male vocalist in a year or so and the most straightforward track on the album.   The other tracks are too disjointed for my taste; like the beatles mixed w/ funkadelic, and a bit of rock -n- roll, played by a schizophrenic DJ.  (Maybe this CD should come with a dime bag.)  To his credit, when I saw Ce-lo being interviewed witht the Gmob a while back he seemed very humble.  It would make a nice soundtrack and has \\"grow on you\\" potential.

0440238609|5.0|Pullman's epic fantasy is sometimes compared to those of C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, or Susan Cooper, but while it is at least their equal in richness, beauty, and page-turning interest, it is much more ambitious and thoughtful.  Tolkien and Cooper excel at atmosphere, but their stories are built on  the morally empty \\"good versus evil\\" framework, where little thought is asked of the reader about what \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" might consist of.  They are two opposing teams, one of which is pretty, and the other, ugly.  Lewis's moral universe is much richer, but still one in which goodness consists of submission to a benign authority.    <br /> <br />\\"His Dark Materials\\" is morally complex and provocative, and many other things I don't want to give away.  Great for older kids and grown-ups.
1565845072|5.0|This is the best of the four Inspector Kurt Wallender police procedurals I've read so far. No secret excursions across the Baltic, no geopolitical-racial thrillers. Just a solidly professional, sometimes uncertain, often brilliant, but always persistent detective plowing through disparate evidence to catch a serial killer. The title is important, too -- even a good, widely experienced cop can be led astray. \\"The first thing that happens isn't necessarily the beginning of the case,\\" or words to that effect. Wallender is a fascinating character, and very human, too. He worries about his relationships with his father and his daughter, feels slightly guilty pleasure when his superiors compliment him, gets scared when he thinks he or those close to him are physically threatened. He even has vaguely erotic dreams about a female pastor he meets in the course of the investigation. But always, after spending an hour with his own bugbears, he shifts gears and becomes a cop again, and a good one. He's a loner who can organize and lead a crack investigative team, an anti-bureaucrat who knows how to orchestrate a productive meeting, a logical rationalist who always listens to his hunches. And even though you'll know pretty early who the killer is in this case, you'll hold your breath every time Wallender unknowingly comes near him. A terrific story.
B000008GEF|5.0|I waited almost 30 years to buy this album.  I knew \\"Give Me Love\\" of course.  But when I bought and listened to it for the first time, I was struck with how familiar the entire album sounded.  I'll bet that in the pre-vanilla world of FM radio of 1973, I may have heard all of the tracks, somewhere in my memory these songs got locked away.<br /><br />But - good music always has the strange quality of familiarity.  You feel you have heard it before.  George Harrison can write a great hook, and in Material World he mines his imagination for sounds that we may recall from the Beatles days - the rhythm guitar riff in \\"The Lord Loves The One\\", for instance, which harks back to the intro of \\"Old Brown Shoe\\".<br /><br />George tips his hat to the Beatles throughout this album.  You get a sense of the huge impact he had on their sound.  But he also steps out here and does an entire album his own way.  He is still presenting a catalogue of songs that were conceived while the Fabs were still together.  It is like \\"All Things Must Pass\\", Part II, and does not disappoint.  The Quiet Beatle, indeed, has a lot to say.<br /><br />We hear a lot about George's vanishing creativity as the 70s waned.  I would counter, and say that George Harrison may be an acquired taste to some.  With repeated listens, his vision and message begin to materialize over time.  His profound sense of unusual chord progressions yields a beautiful sound that is uniquely his.  George Harrison can impart a positive message using the darkest of sounds, which is almost the exact opposite of what Paul McCartney does in his music.  It may be sad that Lennon and McCartney split up - but Harrison brought a lot to the table.  Lennon had his anger and irony; McCartney his soaring musical vision and joy;  but Harrison has his optimism mixed with sadness.  \\"That Is All\\" rivals \\"Something\\", but for some reason was not released as a single and has been below the radar screen for decades.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Harrison CDs.  It is a true solo album, in which he does not run away from his status as an ex-Beatle.<br /><br />Olivia and Dhani Harrison have given us The Concert for George, and a set of remasterings.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|Being a long time Dune fan of both the books and the movie I was really looking forward to the \\"official\\" extended version having seen the 4hr sci-fi channel version over the years. <br /> <br />What you get though is, like others have said, a horribly edited version of the movie with completely screwed up music queues and bad narration. So much so that it was almost painful to sit through the entire film knowing how much better the original release is. All of the Princess Irulan narration is gone, replaced by an unemotional male voice, cheesy production artwork replaces some of the cutscenes, and certain scenes are used more than once completely out of place. The \\"additional\\" footage is of poor quality and crappy acting and doesn't fit at all with the original cut. I could go on and on but suffice to say that it was a travesty. <br /> <br />On the good side the original \\"theatrical\\" cut is very good with DTS sound and decent picture quality. But I didn't buy this for a film I already had on DVD. The extras are ok but there's really nothing that great about them. They seem just sort of thrown in as if they had them lying around and needed extra content. <br /> <br />I give this 3 starts just because I love the original version so much.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'll give this album 5 stars just for the package. Great follow up album although it took me 2 years to actually start to like the music..i actually gave this cd away after i bought it. All in all a good buy. Also i believe Maynard James Keenan gets too much credit, he is a great vocalist but it's all the band members that make a band not just the lead singer. Take billy howerdel out of perfect circle or Danny Carey out of tool and than tell me how awesome the bands are.
1592401791|2.0|This book could have been great, but is actually quite disappointing. It reads like one of those \\"as told to\\" celebrity biographies, with Geoff being the focus and hero at all times, especially during the Beatles' recording sessions. There's very little new insight or information here (other than Geoff's personal opinions about the Beatles as people and performers). Instead, we get a rehash of the old stories and anecdotes that have been around for years. George Martin told these same stories much more interestingly in the past, and with a great deal more humility.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like alot of people I didn't find out about Firefly until I watched Serenity. I enjoyed the movie but, I just felt like I was missing something, So I rented the firefly discs from blockbuster online and after watching the first disc I was hooked went ahead and bought the complete series from amazon(Great price 24.00 brand new!!!), I wanted to have it to watch all those characters and adventures again. The show is funny and smart. So after seeing the full season which unfortunately was cancelled, I watched serenity again and enjoyed it a whole lot more the 2nd time now that I knew the characters so I could feel the movie more. I bought serenity as well goes perfect with the series cause it basically completes it. I pray for more movies!!!!!!!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Listening to my favorite album on Multi-Channel stereo is like redisovering a masterpiece.  Cannot believe this was recorded over 30 years ago!  Pink Floyd was way ahead of their time.  Time & Money are priceless, and the Sax solo at the beginning of Us & Them comes through like a dream!  This album alone is worth the investment I made on my Boston Acoustics system: VR975 Fronts, VR12 Center and VRX Surrounds.  Now,  I am waiting for the rest of the great Floyd albums to come out on Multi-channel audio: Wish You Were Here, Animals, Wall...the list goes on.

The fight scene between her and Brad is laughable - she'd be in traction in real life, I don't care what her training was.  Vaughn is good.  The plot is actually good, but the action is pure B.S.

B00005JOQS|2.0|Once John William's extraordinary score comes blasting out with the title Superman Returns popping up on the screen, and the credits flying across the screen (a nod to the original Superman film), I felt like jumping and cheering. Unfortunately, that was to be the most excitement I would get throughout the 150 minutes I spent watching the most disappointing sequel of the year so far.    You can't help but watch Superman Returns and think about Christopher Reeve, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marc Maclure, and Marlon Brando (the only actor from the original that we actually see and hear in Returns). The reason why you can't stop thinking about those actors and hope you can see them onscreen instead of the actual actors who are in the film is because none of the actual stars, excluding Brandon Routh, convinces you that they are Perry White, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Jimmy Olsen.    Kate Bosworth is just too young (merely 23 years of age) and not vibrant enough to play Lois. Besides, there is no chemistry between her and Routh, who plays Clark Kent and Superman pretty swell! Kal Penn, who played Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, plays one of Luthor's thugs, but his character doesn't speak throughout the film (what a waste of comedic talent), the kid who plays Jimmy Olsen is not funny, and annoys you everytime he appears onscreen. Finally, there's Frank Langella (the man who played Skeletor opposite Dolph Lundgren's He-Man in Masters Of The Universe) who doesn't have the natural charm that Cooper brought to the Perry White character.    Now let's talk about the script: horrendous. The plot and the plot twists are just one big mess aside from some unnecessary special effects and action sequences (the airplane crashing scene where Lois tumbles from one end of the airplane to another), and Clark Kent drinking beer (didn't Superman confess that he never drinks nor lies in his interview with Lois Lane in the original film? It seems Supe is a liar after all!). Warner seems to have rushed through pre-production picking one of the worse drafts of the scripts for production, but why? I'm not going to go into the details, but what were they thinking with the last 30 minutes of the film? Have they lost their minds? This is a Superman movie...not a Lois Lane movie (I hope those of you who saw it understand what I mean?).    The only two good things about the movie are Brandon Routh and the opening credits and musical score. With that aside, Superman Returns flies flat on its face!    Not recommended unless you're a gigantic Superman fanatic.    D
0060934913|5.0|We love Les Halles. And it's even more marvelous knowing that the master chef there is an insane man who describes the production of his three-star meals as the collaborative effort of a team of \\"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths,\\" in all likelihood pierced or tattooed and incapable of uttering a sentence without an expletive or a foreign phrase. One of the reviews describes Bourdain's book as \\"the muscular view of the culinary trenches from one who's been groveling in them, with obvious sadomasochistic pleasure, for more than 20 years.\\" Perhaps that's why it's one of our favorites!
B00005JOQS|4.0|MOVIE: Instead of giving us X-Men: The Last Stand, Bryan Singer decided to take a grander project first. The new Superman sequel has been anticipated for quite some time now, and it truly does live up to the hype. Superman Returns basically is set after Superman II, because I think everyone can agree that we may as well just pretend that numbers III and IV don't exist. Here we see Superman returning back to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now engaged as well as being a new mother. He comes back and also finds that planet Earth is still in chaos with crime and danger around every corner. Lex Luthor is Superman's villain in this sequel once again. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the eccentric pioneer, and suprisingly looks very much like Gene Hackman. Superman Returns is a good movie, it really is. However, I think what I found subpar about it was that it tried to make the man of steel this vulnerable and emotional character. The original films made this character an icon, a character with no weaknesses that could overcome anything. I mean sure, in the hero's journey there must always be some adversity that the main character needs to overcome in order for the plot to work, but for some reason I just never saw Superman as this complex character. I'm not saying that it was bad to make Superman more complex, in fact if I saw a replica of the original with nothing new to offer then I'd be trashing the movie. I really liked Superman Returns, but I just wasn't blown away by it like we were all expecting. The movie doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen before in other superhero movies. I still think that Spider-Man is the film franchise to beat in this genre. On the technical side I can honestly say I was blown away. The CGI work was breathtaking and very detailed. I heard a lot of people complain about the length of the movie, but I never found it to drag at all. It is a great summer blockbuster, but it wasn't great enough to make me anticpate the next installment in the franchise.<br /><br />ACTING: Newcomer Brandon Routh is a perfect fit for the character. His acting was not stilted or dull, and he really added great depth to the character. He had lots of great stuff to work with though, and that definately helped. Kate Bosworth did a fine job but she felt incredibly cold as a character. It seems like she was mad at Superman and that in turn made her mad at everyone else, even her son and fiance. There was no warmth from Lois Lane, and that made the romance of it all feel very dull. Kevin Spacey steals the show and does an amazing job as the power hungry Lex Luthor who plans to grow his own continent. Kevin Spacey was so good that at times I thought he overpowered the Superman character, which I thought hurt the film a little as well.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Bryan Singer definately crafted a well made superhero movie, but when there is a superhero movie in the theater almost every few months sometimes \\"well made\\" is not enough. The only problem with Superman Returns is that it played it safe and didn't change that much. For example, Batman Begins completely reinvented the franchise and gave us a completely fresh new movie to enjoy.

0440238609|4.0|Another series that gets thrust into \\"children's fiction\\" solely because the lead characters are children, Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials Trilogy,\\" center on precocious young protagonist Lyra Belacqua as she cajoles, teases and outright punches the other young urchins huddled around Oxford College to get to the top of the heap. Something called \\"Experimental Theology\\" is being addressed in this alternative universe - one where natural science is frowned upon and the evil of the world has a definite shape - in fact, the people in this tale have visible \\"daemons,\\" animal-shapes that reflect their inner nature. Even as we start to get used to this alternative Calvinist-driven world, Book Two introduces us to Will Parry, a young boy from our own world, who passes into Lyra's world where the two of them become unwiling pawns in an epic battle that comes from the same rich literary base of Tolkein, CS Lewis, and John Milton.
B00005UW9T|5.0|This movie has got to be my favorite childhood movie of all time.  Although it is not historically accurate, the music, plot, and artistry behind this movie are nothing less of great.   <br /> <br />Many other reviewers dislike this movie because of its inaccuracy to history, but in reality... Disney's the Little Mermaid was not true to Hans Christian Anderson's story, nor was Aladdins or many others.  Overall, if you want an entertaining story with romance, action, humor, great music, and a overall heart-felt theme (finding where you belong) then this movie is for you.
0440178002|5.0|More than any other series I own, it is James Clavell's books that inspired me to write. The historical detail, the richness of his characters, and his decision to link families over generations that link the meeting of Western and East Asian civilization over 300 years makes me humble and strive ever harder to write work that can so plunge me into an entirely believable world.
6305428522|5.0|These days nobody seems to care about rigged television shows. After all, the obvious contrivances that networks parade before us year after year result in little more than incredulous shrugs from viewers. A few hours watching daytime talk shows or professional wrestling will expose just how much some people enjoy being fooled for entertainment's sake. On the programming side, behind the camera, far too much remains at stake to let the chips fall where they may. Programs must provide rapid fire entertainment to attract viewers and advertisers and reality rarely delivers the jaw-dropping drama needed to keep audiences transfixed. Creating such tension usually entails some form of premeditation or scripting. Television producers came to this realization very early.<br /><br />The producers of the very popular quiz show \\"Twenty One\\", which ran from 1956 to 1958, apparently subscribed to these views. Following its first unchoreographed and uninspired episode, the sponsor communicated its great displeasure to the producers, and the decision was made to rig the show. Following that, contestants essentially became actors who were completely outfitted and rehearsed. Herbert Stempel appeared and won a string of victories that approached $100,000 in winnings. The movie \\"Quiz Show\\" begins at this point. The show's producers then decided to bring in a more clean cut and \\"proper\\" contestant to win over the hearts of Americans (not to mention their sponsor), and they found this person in Charles Van Doren. But a defiant Stempel, feeling cheated, moved to expose the show. A government attorney, Rob Morrow, convinced his superiors to allow him to investigate the quiz shows. Eventually the whole issue came before a congressional hearing. Such a scandal seems unlikely today. But the bygone audience for the new, and presumably innocent, medium of television felt betrayed.  The genre of the quiz show was almost obliterated by these scandals.<br /><br />\\"Quiz Show\\", a dramatization of these scandals, manages to attain a high level of drama without resorting to violence or sex. Pure character development moves the story along. Herb Stempel, played brilliantly by John Turtorro, evolves from a confident but arrogant winner into a bitter and reckless fall guy. As the network continues to make him empty promises (which involve his return to television), his bitterness turns to feelings of vengeance. Charles Van Doren, played by Ralph Fiennes, nonchalantly traipses into the promises of fame and fortune the producers feed him. In the end he confesses and pays a heavy price.<br /><br />Though \\"Quiz Show\\" makes for great cinema, it shouldn't be confused for a documentary. The film has come under fire for many historical innaccuracies, and some have accused it of following in the deceptive footsteps of the quiz shows themselves. For one, Dick Goodwin, played by Rob Morrow, did not play a central role in the original investigations as depicted in the film. And the actual timing of the historical events, along with how Herb Stempel lost (he did \\"take a dive\\" on the question about \\"Marty\\" but he ultimately lost when Van Doren \\"stopped the game\\" in the show's second round) gets a little skewed. Not to mention that many of the details behind what occured between the sponsors of \\"Twenty One\\", portrayed by Martin Scorsese, and the show's producers, is lost to history. So the producers of this film paradoxically found themselves in the same position as the original producers of \\"Twenty One\\". They needed to make a dramatic film and had to bend the facts here and there to \\"make it work\\". This dilemma frequently occurs in filmmaking that involves historical dramatization.<br /><br />Regardless, none of these criticisms detract from the film's raw power. \\"Quiz Show\\" strives to make a point by fictionalizing certain aspects of fact. Arguably, it is less about the historical events of the quiz show scandals of the 1950s and more about the power of television to deceive.It also presents a theory about how deceptions get propogated up the ranks, who ultimately takes the fall for them, and the effect such events have on the public. This point gets driven home when Dick Goodwin says \\"Television is gonna get us\\". He means all of us, the public, not just the characters in the movie. \\"Quiz Show\\" aims higher than a mere docu-drama of a fifty year old scandal. It tries to make us see the connections between those events and how we experience television in the present tense. Which explains why it doesn't follow the historical facts to the letter. The filmmakers had a bigger picture in mind, and to get that vision across they had to play with the story.<br /><br />\\"Quiz Show\\" is, in the end, a great movie that invites reflection on a medium that has come to dominate our lives. Not only that, it points out that studio heads have a lot of power, and that human beings in positions of power can succumb to corruption, even in the seemingly innocent medium of television.how deceptions get propogated up the ranks, who ultimately takes the fall for them, and the effect such events have on the public.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|\\"Syriana\\" was somewhat hard to follow with the choppy transitions among multiple vaguely-drawn plotlines, but I finally figured it out: The Great Satan conspires with Big Oil to grind the hapless Middle East under foot as they rape the planet.  Using the CIA as their tool, they set out to murder everyone who gets in their way. Two young Middle Easterners rise up against this megalithic monstrosity.  One is the wealthy son of an Emir and the other is the poverty stricken son of an oil worker.  As the labyrinthine plot winds to a pyrotechnic ending, the wealthy prince seeks to overthrow his father's government and set up a government based on principles of liberty, equality, and democracy and thereby save the world.  Of course, the Great Satan must do everything possible to prevent the spread of ideals so foreign to its nature.  Meanwhile the poverty stricken youth studies at the feet of a guru who teaches the complementary doctrines of love, peace, and tranquility on the one hand and blowing up yourself and innocent people in the name of God on the other.<br /><br />Will the movie end in multiple explosions as the poverty stricken youth lovingly, peacefully, and tranquilly blows himself and countless innocent people to kingdom come?  Will the rich prince be taken out by the Great Satan as he is on the verge of saving the world?  Will the bad guys live happily ever after as the world continues its downward spiral to abject poverty and misery?  Or will George Clooney and Matt Damon be able to foil the bad guys, establish Western values in the Middle East despite the best efforts of the CIA, and thereby change the course of history?  It will take you approximately two hours to find out.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi's last movie, \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" is supposed to be the worst movie ever made.  \\"Syriana\\" may just edge \\"Plan 9\\" out for that honor.<br /><br />A FOOTNOTE ON PREMISES:  This movie bottoms its plot on two premises:  Premise one teaches that the United States government is the enemy of true free-market capitalism and democracy in the Middle East.  Premise two teaches that a heroic United States citizen (Matt Damon) can save the Middle East by guiding it into the development of free-market capitalism and democracy.  These premises are based on equal parts irrationality and arrogance.y of true free-market capitalism and democracy in the Middle East.

B000EXZI1O|3.0|This album came out shortly after \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" so if you liked that album you'll probably like this one too. Even though it's a listenable album from start to finish ,I\\"ll recommend this album only to serious Bee Gees fans. For the casual fan though, you may like the hits \\"Tragedy\\" ,\\"Too Much Heaven\\", \\"Love You Inside Out\\", the title cut and maybe two or three of the remaining tracks. In that case I would suggest sticking with just the hits and go with \\"Their Greatest Hits:The Record\\" instead.

B0001HAHXW|1.0|I have a lingering suspicion that many of the 'reviewers' don't have the life experiences to back up their vapid opinions. As a middle-aged man with divorce, AA and countless personaal demons in MY past, this album spoke to me like nothing E.C. has done since Behind The Sun, a record some of you kids could use a dose of. I have waited since the Bluesbreakers for a full-length treatment of Johnson by Clapton, and I was nothing less than exhilarated by this all-too-brief disc. Like those old Johnson discs, these tunes are not intended as easy listening!! These guys, who are ten times the men you're likely to be...are singing to themselves, and to GOD! So bend an ear and listen to their version of the really solid spiritual excursion!                   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6301966074|5.0|To start, I won't labor through listing all of the music on the concert video.  Reviewer Alejandra Vernon did that nicely in her excellent Spotlight Review.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Elvis concert video from a musical perspective - that would be \\"The '68 Comeback Special\\".  But this video belongs on your Elvis shelf because it reveals an Elvis that we have not seen in his earlier work.<br /><br />Pensive, tired, still unselfishly giving of himself to his fans.  The thrill is gone and it has become work.  He has a constant trail of people following him, depending on him, and he has the burden of projecting that Elvis image continuously.<br /><br />There is a lot of off stage footage, which shows him to be thoughtful of and genuinely generous with his fans.  He looks great for his age, but he is aging, and he seems sad.  It's interesting that his only apparent joy in life (at least in this on the road, tour environment) seems to be music, including especially the impromptu off stage stuff . . . singing to himself in the limo, jamming gospel backstage with the band members. He's very likeable (loved by millions, of course) and one is glad to see him find escape in some good thing that he enjoys.<br /><br />The on-stage music is good but is lacking a bit of the fire of his younger years.  The stagework in the video is a montage from the series of stops on the tour.  Clearly some of the concerts are better than others.  At some he is a bit reserved and his famous stage posturing and movement is stilted and a parody of earlier times. He is HOT at a couple of them and, again, you can tell that he never stopped loving the music. The video brings it out clearly.  Quite remarkably, we also see that he is still dealing with stagefright.<br /><br />Speaking of the music - It seems that in every concert video (by anyone), there is a standout performance.  In this one it's Elvis' imperfect but driving performance of \\"Burning Love\\".  He introduces it as a \\"new song\\", has to read the lyrics for much of it, and it is incomplete.  The lyrics are a variation on what will later become maybe his last great #1 Hit recording. He even seems a bit embarrassed by the \\"silliness\\" of the tune . . . but he WAILS it out like the Elvis Presley of 10 years earlier.<br /><br />This video does a pretty good job of showing the phenomenon of Elvis at (or a bit past) his peak: truly bigger than life, unarrogant, flashy but unassuming as only he could be, weary, human, lovable.  I hope that God received him into the habitations that he loved to sing about.<br /><br />Recommended - for Elvis fans, music lovers, and students of remarkable people.and it is incomplete.

B000B7HZXM|5.0|First off to avoid any conflict of interest claims I admit that I an a huge Rod Stewart fan. That being said, I just wasn't interested in hearing him do the old American classics(which I also love). I just didn't see how he could do them justice, that is, until I saw his DVD \\"Live from Royal Albert Hall\\" in which he did several of the songs from his first \\"Great American Songbook\\". I was just blown away. These songs were now his. I went to the computer to order one of the CDs but my wife talked me into getting all four and I am surely not sorry. I believe that there are very few CDs available with no weak tracks(there are some) but here are four that just don't have a weak track(IMHO). He has made all of these great songs his. My all time favorite song is \\"Stardust\\" by Hoagy Carmichael. I had never heard a version that I thought could top his, until now. If you love the old standards you should really give these 4 CDs a listen. They'll melt your heart!!!!
B000002O5L|5.0|FULL MOON FEVER by Tom Petty is that rare and precious thing. An album in which all the songs are noteworthy. There isn't a single bad track on the album, only tracks that are slightly less good, than the really good ones. Immediately Petty establishes a sense of space with the sublime lamentation of FREE FALLIN, a song that the word timeless was invented for. The usual theme of thwarted loved is present from the outset, but on this occasion the music and instrumentation sparkle with the crisp production methods of Jeff Lyne of ELO fame. Fortunately the over the top theatricality of ELO is kept at bay by Petty's commitment to his roots.  But the presence of Lynne steers the album away from being simply a Heartbreakers album, minus the Heartbreakers. This is especially prevalent on I WONT BACK DOWN a song which I could never imagine the Heartbreakers recording.  Petty takes this opportunity to expand some of his song writing ideas to encompass satirical takes on late 80's culture in YER SO BAD and youthful counter culture in ZOMBIE ZOO. But Petty is most comfortable and successful producing the slightly off kilter love songs he is known for. Songs which for the most part are positive, but hide a barely concealed abyss of darkness, which separates Petty from his contemporaries. Petty has an incredible knack of producing astonishingly sing-a-long and commercial sounding music which provides the camouflage for songs that have an aching sense of loss and lamentation. FULL MOON FEVER is one the finest evocations of this.
B000035P5E|5.0|Most spy stories get dated rather quickly as old antagonists become commercial partners and old issues become just so much former silliness.  That Eye Of The Needle, clearly a spy story on the surface, has lasted longer than most is attributable to a number of factors, paramount among them being it is much more than a spy story.<br /><br />I think of it as a 'study in reluctance'.  Faber (Sutherland) clearly does not want to have to kill people as he goes about his assigned spying duties, but darn it they keep putting his mission in jeopardy and he just has to...  Similarly, Lucy (Nelligan) doesn't really want to cheat on her paraplegic and surly husband (Cazenove), but Faber is so attentive; nor, when she learns the truth of his life does she want to do what must be done, but...<br /><br />In lesser hands this story could turn to mush.  But with Ken Follett's best-selling novel as a base, Richard Marquand's deft direction, and phenomenally excellent casting in not only the two starring roles, but across the board, it's one 'spy story' that holds up well.  Of course, I've only watched it maybe two dozen times so far...perhaps it will get boring after the fourth or fifth dozen viewings.  Probably not though.  This is a classic movie I highly recommend to anyone.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|One of the best action movies ever.  I was pleased with the dvd because of all the extras that you don't get with just a vhs copy.  If you like this movie, you will really enjoy the dvd version of it.
B00009V7PJ|3.0|Although the DVD itself is excellent, the packaging is so not worth the near $24 I paid. It is the cheesy cardboard DVD box with the flap that doesn't stay closed. When carefully peeling off the seal, the graphics tore. Just disappointed.
0525948023|5.0|For the people who write \\"There are good ideas in it\\", have totally missed the point.  What this book is is the tool for awakening to a new state of consciousness for those who are ready enough to understand his message.  Once you understand the message and view the egoic dysfunction within you, as well as within everyone you meet, you'll see the epidemic proportion and urgency of the matter to relinquish the egoic state of conciousness.  I see people here reviewing saying that Eckhart talks about reincarnation.  Its as if they didn't even read the book.  Eckhart says simply put that god is everlasting, and if you still havent understood what god is read this book.  The consciousness that animates and sustains all things, the eternal 1 life that is so vast it can sustain all the myriad forms of itself, of which you me and even the pessimist reviwer are all part.  Again, if you are looking for something to read so you can dismiss it as false this is it, as well as any book you pick up.  However if you are ready to listen to an amazing teaching that can profoundly transform you and everyone around you this is also it.  Please give it a read people, the world is in bad shape and in need of change and you are that all powerful being who can change it.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|This movie is a true classic.  It works because it has drama in it, but does not overload it like Batman Begins, and it has humor without getting silly as in Batman Forever.  Catwoman is the most human I have ever seen her.  Michael Keaton is by far the best Batman.  he does not play him as a silly Val Kilmar did but also does not whisper act like Christian Bale.  The screenplay has humor and emotion in it.  The action is solid.  The special effects are very good for their time, (unlike mortal kombat which came out 2 years later).  This is how Batman was made to be.  Also the special features are much better than the last dvd.  This should be added to your movie collection.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Ok. First a little about where I'm coming from. Wolf Creek, bar none, was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. So I had strong reservations about getting Hostel. My reservations turned out to be unfounded. If you saw Wolf Creek and were disturbed, Hostel is NOT Wolf Creek. It's much tamer on three important levels.  <br /> <br />First. The characters in Hostel are basically shallow and there's no sense of identifying with them which left me with much less emotional investment and reaction than with Wolf Creek.  <br /> <br />Second. The torture scenes are not that bad. They are effective but not to the point that you finally say \\"enough already!\\" There's a good balance. Just when you think it may get TOO dicey, they cut to another scene. Yes they do show a few close ups but they are very quick, like a few seconds. Many scenes are not shown at all. They are assumed by the screaming. There is one eye sequence that I recommend a fast forward. It wasn't emotional for me, just disgusting. Sort of like watching someone eat a worm. <br /> <br />The third thing that separates this movie from Wolf Creek. In Wolf Creek, the murder scenes lasted very long; up to 10 minutes straight sometimes. And the screaming was so realistic, I wanted to jump in the TV and kill the killer. LITERALLY!  <br /> <br />With Hostel, it's nothing like that. Roth takes you to another scene within a minute or so. Less in some cases. Couple that with shallow characters and you have a watchable movie. <br /> <br />The GREATEST thing for me was the last 20 minutes of Hostel. In Wolf Creek, the ending generated anger and wanting revenge. No spoiler here. Trust me, you'll like the ending of Hostel. <br /> <br />The scenery is very cool and not overdone. It's E. Europe (xxVakia) yes,  but it's not 'vampirish', nor too dark.' No fog. It is your average former communist state. Gray and drab in many places but with newer colorful scenery too. There are a few street scenes where it's like any other European tourist spot.  <br /> <br />Two characters in the movie made me laugh. The cab driver and the janitor. You'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />I'm a DVD collection nut and treat them like any other hobby. You know 'don't touch.' The whole anal thing. Wolf Creek is the first and ONLY movie I have ever thrown in the trash, case and all. I would normally have put it on eBay or filed it away, alphabetically. But I wanted it out of my house and out of my life. With Hostel, I may watch it again.  <br /> <br />Hoped this helped. <br />

B00005JOQS|1.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers *** <br /> <br />Let me first state that I am a HUGE Superman fan. I love Superman, and I like to think I understand why Superman resonates so strongly with modern culture in general (and readers especially). <br /> <br />I have to say, this was the most boring superhero movie I have ever seen. But, I was most disappointed with the treatment of this iconic character. <br /> <br />Singer doesn't understand Superman. <br /> <br />Superman is the most virtuous of heroes. He does things because they are the right things to do, and because he has the power to do so. The strength of Superman is his character and his mentality, not the fact that he can fly and lift ships. Superman cares about people, first and foremost. And though not without flaws, he's a shining bright example in a dark world. <br /> <br />In Singer's \\"vision\\" we get a horribly selfish Superman who acts more like a petulant-adolescent-wannabe-home-wrecker than a real man. Superman spends a lot of time pouting over Lois Lane(whom he left for five years) and when he gets back he can't seem to understand why she is upset or why she would move on. Singer doesn't understand that Superman draws his strength from Earth(on Krypton he would be normal like everyone else). Everything that is good and decent about Superman comes from living here. All of his love, all of his humanity, his reason for living. This is the only home he knows. And he effectively throws it away to check up on Krypton(apparently Superman doesn't know about light-years and heavenly bodies existing in the past)... this is the big hurdle of Superman-> He abandons Earth and Us, to go do his own thing (something Superman would never do). When Superman returns he really is an alien, because he exiled himself purposefully. I will tell you right now, Superman would only leave Earth in order to save it. Aside from that, he is completely emotionless, and flat. Superman bears the weight of the world and smiles allthe way, yet this Superman almost groans. He only saves people to get to Lois. Everything he does is for Lois, he even has a scene atop the Daily Planet where he practically tries to steal her away from her new family unit! Routh acts like someone pretending to be Superman, not like a man that knows he's Superman. And also, a man without a personality. <br /> <br />Lois Lane is just as badly cast, and spends most of the film with a worried expression on her face. She hates herself for loving someone other than Big Blue, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two leads. Besides, the man we see isn't spectacular, and he's definitely not the one that makes us feel like a kid again. So Lois has lost all the spunk and nerve, and quirky toughness that makes us drool over the character(like in the comics). <br /> <br />Then there's Lex Luthor, whose big plan is to create a huge Kryptonian continent, and sell the real estate. He is absolutely joyless, and doesn't even revel in having an edge over Superman. Not to mention that his primary motivation for wanting to kill Superman is, \\"you sent me to prison for five years.\\" <br /> <br />Lex hates Superman because he is loved. Lex isn't loved, because he equates power with love and admiration. This is his big flaw; not some petty revenge. Spacey acts horrendously in this movie(I thought I'd never say), especially the scene where he tells Lois Lane she is, \\"WRROONNGG.\\" My whole group was laughing at the ineptness of the moment. <br /> <br />Then there's the kid... whew. This kid's acting is so completely blank and emotionless it makes you want to put any kid in there. Consider, that the first time this kid sees Superman flying it is the first time he has seen a person fly- ever! But his expression is just as blank and joyless as the movie itself. To top it off, in a horrible turn he is Superman's son! In the comics Superman and Lois are married. Nope, not here. But they do have a Supertyke, who might just split up LoisLane's relationship with Perry White's nephew! Hooray! Is this audience supposed to be cheering when we find this out? By the way, he's not that super: when Lois is stuck with him behind a steel door and asks for help, the kid sits there putting olives on his fingers. Olives! Where did they find these people? <br /> <br />(Remember at the end of Superman 2 where Supes said, \\"Don't worry, Mr. President. I'll never leave you alone again.\\") I guess Singer and his writers missed that one! But I thought at the very least it might be a fun, entertaining movie to watch. <br /> <br />...Nope! More cg doesn't equal better. There was no moment throughout any of the action where I felt blown away or exhilarated. It felt like the action was there out of obligation. Superman just pops out of nowhere and flies so much, we don't even care he can fly.  When Supes first takes up-up-and-away, we should feel inspired and awestruck.  Superman is more than just what he can do, Superman is infinately virtuous, and that's what really makes him a hero. <br /> <br />Then there's the story, which was really long. We were as distracted and bored as the kid with the olives on his fingers. <br /> <br />The 50-or-so-person-clap at the end of this movie wasn't out of joy, or elation, but that awkward clap where people follow each other out of obligation. Everything felt like an obligation in this movie, and there was no love for the film or the characters. All this Lex wants is money, which really Lex doesn't care about. All this Lois wants, is Superman... but why? And all this Superman wants is his old life back... but he abandoned it.  The psyched up six year old boy sitting next to me was comlpetely drained and bored, and that's a bad sign in a superhero movie.  There is nothing good about this film, or anything that does sparkly-eyed, Big Blue any justice. Which leaves us without sparkly eyes either.

B00003CXCQ|2.0|Based on the classic fairytale, Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is often held as being the first successfully animated feature presented in technicolor, but people back in the 1930s must not have been too hard to please because I really don't see what's so special about this movie.  To me, Snow White remains who is most likely Disney's most annoying heroine.  All she does throughout the entire movie is whine about her plight and complain about the dwarfs' manners constantly.  When the dwarfs invite her to stay in their house, she suddenly takes over as a motherly figure and bossing everyone around just because she's a princess, completly forgetting the fact that she's the one who's the guest, not the other way around, and treating the dwarves like immature children when they're clearly adult men.  What the dwarfs or the evil queen's magic mirror see in her that's so \\"fair\\" I really can't see myself.   <br /> <br />Snow White's relationship with the Prince is completly unbelievable.  She only meets him once and is instantly sure that he's her true love, even though they know nothing about each other.  They don't even reveal the Prince's name at all and the Prince doesn't appear again until the last scene of the film.  He doesn't even kiss Snow White because he's been searching for her out of love, he kisses her just because he heard about a beautiful sleeping princess in the forest.  He didn't do a single thing to fight against the evil queen.  The dwarves did far more to protect Snow White than the Prince did yet when the Prince wakes her up with his kiss, she's instantly in love with him, they magically get married and live happily ever after, so what gratitude does she show to the dwarves?  She says goodbye to them and says thank you and goes off to live in a fancy castle while the dwarves are left by themselves in the forest.   <br /> <br />There is very little to virtually zero character development in this film.  Almost all the characters expect for Grumpy remain the same.  Grumpy starts off hating Snow White but he eventually loves her too and is the only one who goes through such development, which is why he's the only character in this movie that I liked.  The animation still manages to be impressive despite the film's old age.  There's a great deal of detailed animation given to the beautiful backgrounds and Snow White features a lot of unique and fun designs for its cast of characters, especially for all the loveable animals and the dwarves.  But Disney at this point obviously couldn't properly animate adult males as they avoided animating the Prince as much as possible, hence why he only appears in two scenes throughout the entire film.   <br /> <br />The musical score is sadly very forgettable as most of the background music sounds more or less the same without any real distinctive tunes that really stand out.  The only vocal songs in this film that I actually enjoyed were the classic songs \\"Whistle While You Work\\" and \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\" but all the rest of the songs I could care less about.  Most of the humor in the film comes from the animals and the dwarves trying their hardest to look cute enough to make you want to go out and buy their merchandise and not much else.  The film could've been much shorter than what it was and the story be completly unaffected, but it drags itself out longer than it should with all the useless cute animal scenes when they could've been using this time to develop the characters more.  Despite its faults, Snow White will always be remembered as a classic for its impressive animation, entirely free from the taint of today's overly-abused CGI animation, and for being Disney's first animated movie.  Younger children and diehard Disney fans will love this movie for its historical importance in the world of animation, but those looking for solid entertainment will find themselves bored by the movie's paper-thin plot, bland characters, and dull music.

B00005UD0O|5.0|Mark Twain often set up a contrast between the West and the supposedly civilized and superior East with stories like \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\".  In 'Who Shot Liberty Valance' we have that same rivalry represented by a Senator who visits a territory readying for statehood.  Here, however, law and order get a more sympathetic reading with  Jimmy Stewart's ('Mr. Smith Goes to Washington') perfect performance. In '..Liberty Valance' he is injecting law and the American way to the wayward West, represented by the titled rascal outlaw, played convincingly by Lee Marvin, in what has to be one of his best roles.  Similarly, John Wayne has a classic  perfomance as the noble cowboy who seems to bridge the gap of decency into both worlds.  Then, there is a shared love interest and ironic plot twists that give this film an excellent story.  This whole grand film was skillfully assembled by the able hand of director John Ford.  Highly recommended for the uninitiated.
B000002J0P|5.0|I am a big fan of rootsy, acoustic rock with some jam band style, but not too much jam band style. This album is a fantastic treat that consistently delivers great music, song after song.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is deffinetely not Madonna's best album (in my point of view), but not the worst. I give it 5 stars just because am a great fan of her but that doesn't mean all her work is great.   I have to say that if you like to listen to music that has good lyrics and good meanings,, don't get this CD beacause it lacks depth and the words have nothing special at all. But at the end this record was supposed to be a DANCE record. So if you want to shake it all night.. GO AHEAD!! i do like some tracks like 'HUNG UP', 'GET TOGETHER', 'SORRY' and 'JUMP' they will make you jump out of your seats!!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I thought it was a good horror flick but surprised by all the nudity and sex scenes.  It was well acted and there are lots of great creepy scene locations.  The building where the torturing took place was perfect!  Jay Hernandez was great especially in the end.
B000005RTG|5.0|During the 80s, the only way to hear anything by Deep Purple with David Coverdale on cassette was to buy Deepest Purple where you could hear Stormbringer and Burn. With the success of the Mark II reunion, Burn was finally released on cassette. Stormbringer and Come Taste the Band were still mysteries to me. After a 19-year haitus from buying Purple albums I am back and eager to hear what I can. I picked up Burn on CD and loved it, so I had to get Stormbringer and CTtB next. Stormbringer was at first a disappointment but surprisingly I found I really got into Come Taste the Band. If I had heard it without knowing who it was I would have said it was early White Snake. Without Blackmore it doesn't sound like a DP album. It's more funky and more like the hard rock/blues style of early White Snake than Deep Purple. And yet, I like yet. It makes me wish there were more albums like this and if there are which ones are they? For the first time in my life I feel I can truly appreciate 70s hard rock/funk. The bass is groovy for lack of a better expression. Bolin rocks on guitar though his style is clearly more blues based, whereas Blackmore was more classical based. Jon Lord gets less exposure here but his solo on You Keep On Movin' is hauntingly beautiful. The opening track rips its way out off the speakers and burns the air. Gettin' Tighter has such a cool and funky bridge. Lady Luck and I Need Love are prime previews of the White Snake sound. The album is original and unique among DP albums. For something different and enjoyable this is worth a listen. Too bad there wasn't at least one more album with this line-up. It would have seemed less an anomaly then.
B00023B1LC|3.0|I read The Bourne Identity before I saw the movie. I loved the book. Great suspense-filled, action-packed story filled with plot twists. Then I saw the movie. <br /> <br />As action movies go, it was pretty good. But as the movie came to a close I got more and more disappointed. The movie does not follow the book and makes some pretty significant changes!  <br /> <br />I don't know if the book's plot twists were just too complicated for the movie or what but I wish the film makers had at least tried. <br /> <br />Overall though, The Bourne Identity is a great action flick. My husband hadn't read the book and he loved it. My recommendation would be to wait a while before watching the movie if you've already read the book or watch the movie before reading the book. The book is so good anyway that reading it after the movie will probably just make it's more intense plot that much more entertaining. <br /> <br />Bottom line - enjoy them but take them as separate works. Don't expect them to be alike, otherwise you'll be disappointed like I was.
B000001Y9I|4.0|I was and am again a big DP fan. With so many of the old albums coming out remastered and with bonus tracks and studio outtakes I once again felt I had to get everything I could and that led me to the newest albums with Steve Morse. When Ritchie Blackmore last left in 1974, the band's sound changed so much that it could have easily passed for a proto-type White Snake album. Ritchie always had a certain style that was unmistakable and a key ingredient to the Purple sound. Steve Morse probably couldn't have been a better choice to take over the guitar spotlight. I knew him only by name but as a fussion guitarist there was probably no better band for him to join where he could both shine and bring fresh ideas to an old classic band. Younger than the other members and of the second generation of guitarists Morse brings a new guitar sound to the band that often smacks of 1987-style metal. Though his solo style is very different from Blackmore's, Morse proves he can blaze his own trail with the classic DP line-up of Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice. Where the band seemed to be struggling to find itself from 1987 to 1993, this album heralds the new Deep Purple and very refreshing it is. <br /> <br />Personal favourites of mine include the lengthy and amazing Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming with its contrast of acoustic guitar, rock and roll hard rock sound, and beautiful electric guitar melody. I also was surpsied to hear and enjoy the somewhat folksy The Aviator, which reminds me of Nazareth for some reason, and the beautifully written and played A Touch Away. Somebody Stole My Guitar is an excellent hard rock track that would have made a great album opener. If there are any songs I am not into it's probably because I got this album along with several others just last week and I am still exploring it and learning to enjoy it more and more.
0393317552|5.0|Mr. Diamond's book proposes answers to quesions about why some cultures have had dominance over other cultures since the dawn of mankind. It's an original, previously unexplored, very detailed, and probably valid, explanation. It also gives the reader a sound basis of facts, with which anyone who wishes to can look at the world for more examples of his idea.
B000005RQT|5.0|Deep Purple have two classic albums that I will always be proud to say I own: Machine Head and In Rock. Machine Head is one of those albums that I enjoy listening to from time to time but I don't need to hear it often. It's a classic and that's good enough. In Rock, however, is one of my alltime favourite albums, a certainly one of my desert island picks. This remastered version features the full length version of Speed King which definately adds dimension to not only the song but the whole album. It literally explodes in the same tympanic membrane-ripping style that it closes with on Hard Loving Man. Jon Lord is an amazing musician, doing to his organ what few can manage even on guitar. His solos are crazy, wild, off-key even, and yet come across with style, talent, and energy. The man is one of the few people that can make me appreciate the sound of the hammond organ. Ritchie Blackmore choses the raunchiest guitar sound to come out of any DP album until Steve Morse turned up the distortion on Abandon. Somehow, however, that early raw sound just sounds so much wilder. If the band's purpose was to drive the recording levels off the charts then they certainly did it here. Gillan is amazing and I don't think he has ever sounded better since. His vocals are wilder and crazier than on any subsequent album, and he holds nothing back. If you've heard him with Episode Six then you have to wonder what happened between Mr. Universe and Bloodsucker. Who let the rabid cougar out? <br /> <br />This new release is a gem with not only a cleaner sound but with the b-sides, studio outtakes and studio goof-ups it becomes an even greater joy to listen to. In between bonus tracks you can here improvised musical comedy as members goof up or goof around in the studio. It's too bad the rest of the remastered albums didn't have all this. <br /> <br />If you're still not convinced after all these great reviews then give the samples a listen and then get your copy. This album is a milestonein hardrock/metal!
0375931007|5.0|How can you praise an author enough when his reader finds sympathy and compassion for his unlikely narrator: death? How can you recommend a book enough when you spent every spare moment for three days gorging on its 552 pages? Or when you stayed up until after 1:00 a.m., sobbing as quietly as you can so as not to wake anyone while reading the devastating, yet tender ending--how can you make others feel those feelings before they've read the book so they will want read the book--when you are not the wordsmith? In the midst of all the horror of WWII, the narrator can still keep a wicked sense of humor. Once he stated \\"You humans. You kill me!\\" (How does the phrase go? I thought I'd 'die' laughing!)This book is beautiful. It is haunting. I want to read it again and again and again. I want to shout it to everyone: if you love books, READ THIS ONE! <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is the first album that I've ever listened to that had a learning curve (at least for me).  The first time through the album I thought all the songs sounded the same.  I literally got lost in the 28 songs, and couldn't remember which one was which...my initial conclusion: the album sucks.  Second time through, some songs start to stand out, but mostly it still was a big pile of sound. However, I started to notice that from a technical point of view this album \\"sounds\\" really, really good.  The best technically sounding album RHCP has ever done (IMHO).  Third time through I finally started to get it (I guess I'm a little slow).  Now after a dozen or so times through my final Conclusion: This is the best album RHCP has ever created, and is well on it's way to becoming one of my favorite albums of all time.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Three Days Grace is definately one of those bands you can count on to always produce some good music. I own their first CD, and it sits among my collection as a \\"sure thing\\". One of those CDs I can always listen to without having to skip forward to another song. After all, for me, that's the test of a good CD.  <br /> <br />Anyways, being a lover of all kinds of music, and knowing TDG's last album was 10x better than the other crap out there today I went ahead and bought this album. Once again, they deliver, this time with even more of a punch. The guitars are better, the beats are better, the songs are catchier and the lyrics are deeper. What more can you ask for? The boys have progressed immensely. <br /> <br /> Among some of my favorite songs are \\"Animal\\", \\"Pain\\" and \\"Time of Dying\\". \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Never to Late\\", \\"Get out Alive\\" and \\"Let it Die\\" are also fantastic, and show a slower side to the album, proving that they have the voices and the talent to come up with more than just your average scream your heart out angst album. In the end, they produce catchy songs of quality which makes this album a must have for any rock fan or just pure lover of good music. <br /> <br />This is probably one of my shortest reviews, but not much needs to be explained. It's simple, this CD is an absolute success and the other 5 star reviews on here in addition to mine are even more proof. Dish out the 10 bucks because it's definately worth it. I wasn't disappointed, nor were the other people I told about this album who bought it.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I believe these American recordings are the true Johnny Cash.  They just let him play and sing what he wanted, and he put his whole heart and soul into the songs.  You want to hear about the life, loves, and regrets of a dying man?  Listen to this album.  This is beautiful because it is real.  It is not doctored and synthesized like so much of the music that is put out today.  This is the story of a real life.  If you can get your kids to listen to it, do so, because it tells so many real stories.
0805066691|5.0|This book is one of the few or the only book for that matter that has gives you a complete understanding of how the Indians became extinct. The book focuses on more factual information like battles, generals/cheifs, brocken treaties, and some cruelty of the colonists. Overall I give this book 5 stars not only because it is the only book on the military history of the American Natives, but because it is so well written and enjoyable.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|this woman's glory is that of a supreme recording artist...videos and tours notwithstanding, it will be her body of recorded work that everyone will remember about Lady Madonna, the finest \\"pop\\" female recording artist for over 20 years.... and her albums keep getting stronger and more mature with each new release.  I love the early years and the Madonna of the \\"singles\\" era...but to truly appreciate her art is to listen to the triptych consisting of \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Music\\", and the vastly and unjustly under-appreciated \\"American Life\\".  Along comes \\"Confessions On a Dance Floor\\" and simply condenses all the glory, strength, joy, and meltingly beautiful universe of dance music (and Madonna) in one album...because Madonna has always been and will always be a proponent of dance music...never has nor ever will be a fine singer (\\"Evita\\" comes close...quite beautiful), and she IS TO BLAME for being the \\"mother\\" of all the untalented, image conscious, diva-wanna-be whores that continue to populate our sinking-in-the-sludge world of \\"pop\\" music......but Madonna has what all the others that followed have not: TALENT, a sure sense and authority of popular dance music, and an unerring command in the recording studio.  May the Lady reign for as long as she wishes......(but not as a spokeswoman for that horrid, crappy, and maker of disposable fashion H&M!!!!!)<br />Luigi ~ NYC
0307276902|5.0|I really don't understand why people got their knickers into such a twist when they discovered James Frey's tale of shocking drug and alcohol addiction wasn't true.  So what?!  Does that affect the writing, the enjoyment?  No, of course not.  It's a damn good read, emotionally draining and written in a style that's perfect for the subject matter.  Those snobs who throw up their hands after first loving it and then saying they were ripped off are like people who suddenly realise they \\"don't like\\" a wine after they discovered it's a cheaper brand than they at first thought.  Get over it!  Either you like it or you don't - stop listening to what other people say.  I loved it!
B000F3TBIO|2.0|Let me start this out with saying I love Mike Patton. My fake ID name 15 years ago was Mike Patton (not Michael Patton). I was really excited to hear about this album. I love Amon Tobin's work too, but I don't really see his style come through here at all. This comes accross as a collection of Patton B-sides never intended for release and given to a bunch of hip hop/electronic stars to try and make it sound good. The lyrics aren't interesting either. As a Patton fan, I will never be able to avoid listening to something new of his. Also as an artist, I can understand that creating something, whether it may be bad or good, starts as an idea. Many times it is hard to move on to another idea without completing one first. You gotta hand it to the guy for having so many successes with so many unique ideas. I am surprised he hasn't had a miss before now.

B0002W18MU|5.0|I walked into a record store this week, and heard this new Johnny Cash album on the soundsystem. Some idiot was talking to a cashier, asking incredulously how a guy like Cash got his career. It's not always about technical virtuosity, my friend.     Listen to this record -- really listen to it, and you will find a beautiful, heartfelt record made by someone who knew he was near the end (and sounds like it), but had some last things to say.  Johnny Cash's greatness didn't lie in breathtaking guitar skill, or a several octave voice. He was a great storyteller and interpreter of songs. He sang with conviction and empathy, and you believed him - whether he wrote the song himself or not. When his voice was strong, it was as commanding as anyone's. When it was vulnerable, it was heartbreaking.     This album is as good as any of the American material I've heard. (Most of the album is non-stop highlights, but 'If You Could Read My Mind', '4 Strong Winds', and 'I'm Free From the Chain Gang Now' are particularly unforgettable.) I've been playing this disc constantly since I bought it 3 days ago, and I can't get it out of my head.  Johnny's voice is weaker but haunting; his persona still spellbinding. An appropriate farewell to a brilliant artist and American icon. Thank you Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin.
B0007GAERG|5.0|After 'Glitter,' I disregarded Mariah.  Then, I heard 'Through The Rain,' and bought 'Charmbracelet.'  I was a bit disappointed, but temporarily happy.  After the year-long gap in music, I thought that Carey was through.  Then, 'MiMi' was released.  This album definetely marks the one-and-only comeback.  It is flawless from song one to song fourteen (or eighteen, depending on the re-release).  It's vocals are 'over-baked' to perfection, and every song shows soultry depth and fun.  Perfect, and what fans have FINALLY been waiting for.
074327931X|4.0|I used this book, along with Kaplan's GMAT Prep 2006, and found that this is a good supplemental book but should not be used as your primary GMAT resource. It doesn't contain an introduction to the GMAT or any information about the structure of the test or how it is scored; it is just a large book of practice problems. It also does provide some strategies for attacking problems, but it assumes that you already know Kaplan's basic methods, so if you are using this to supplement the official guide or another resource, you may become confused. Additionally, there is absolutely no information on the writing section of the GMAT, and it would have been helpful and appropriate for the book to include examples of `6' essays. <br /> <br />I did think the problems were as or more difficult than most I received on the GMAT (and I scored in the 99th percentile, so I did get the hardest problems on the test). However, all the problems you receive are in the book and there is no online or computer resource to go along with this, so you won't get the experience of doing difficult problems in a GMAT-like setting. Additionally, some of the problems found here repeat themselves in Kaplan's other resources (especially in the practice tests for the main Kaplan prep book). Despite the book's flaws, I felt prepared for the GMAT using only this and main Kaplan prep book, so I consider it to be an effective resource.
B000B8QF14|4.0|BIAB is both a DVD and a CD, and the DVD is really amazing. Its a concert DVD of the American Idiot tour at Milton Keynes, and It will just blow you away. It all looks as if it was released in the theater, with interviews by BJA, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool. You'll love it. Iteven has rehersal footage, and some off-time footage aswell.<br /><br />However, the CD in this situation kinda bombs. It's not as good sound quality in par with the DVD, and whoever threw the CD in with the package must of mistaken it with another concert, because the CD version sounds A LOT DIFFERENT than the DVD version. The crowd's cheering sounds different, Billie Joe's singing sounds different, and all the intercutting speeches have been omitted.<br /><br />But overall, If you are a Green Day fan you must have this.
1881273628|5.0|This is a very important subject that I feel every couple should look into.  The ideas discussed in this book are simple and so basic.  I bought this one for myself and the men's edition for my husband, so he would believe that it is really speaking to him.  I hope he reads it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I like hard, thoughtful rock and this is one of my favorites. <br />The sounds are captivating even if you don't always like the sentiment it brings you to. <br />  Eulogy is so evokative, from the exquisite anticipation at the beginning to the sound of maynard's controlled rage and dry sarcasm throughout. It's probably my favorite song on the album, even though I think his outrage is misdirected. <br />  Die Eire Von Satan is also one of my favorites, not because of the tasty cookie recipe, but the industrial sounding hard core metallic beat and sinister sounding vocal. <br />   AEnima is right on in sound and content. The music is a roller coaster of rhythm and tempo strung together by words that should be said. <br />  I think it's \\"hooker with a penis\\" that is the story of tool's \\"sellout\\" that I love. Kid with all the 'right' paraphenalia calls out 'sell out to the man', never realizing that he has been swallowed whole into the conformist system.  <br /> I love this cd and recommend it.
B00005JMAH|4.0|My son has wanted this movie for a long time.  I bought it for his birthday through Amazon.  Easy to purchase.  However, the estimated delivery time was off.  We received it a week after expected and after his birthday.  He still loved it!
B000001FB6|4.0|This was a nice effort for the reunion.  Not every track is a gem, but the tracks Knocking at Your back Door, Under the Gun, and Perfect Strangers more than make up for the filler.  Be careful though.  The newer remaster does have Son of Alerik on it, which in my opinion is just an OK instrumental, but I actually prefer the mastering of the original version without that track.  The newer remaster has a way hotter (annoying) top end which makes it more difficult to listen to.
B00078XGRO|5.0|The Borg are back, and there may be no stopping them! <br /> <br />I admit to being a Star Trek nut, but Generations left me feeling very disappointed.  Then I hear there's going to be a new Next Gen movie.  Ok, I'll give them another chance. <br /> <br />Holy Toledo!  This movie is awesome!  Great effects + Great story = The best Next Gen movie of them all.  We finally get to see the birth of the Star Trek we all know and love in this film's finale.  The Borg are back and badder than ever... and have a very hot Queen to lead them (Alice Krige).  Patrick Stewart really gets to show some anger, which didn't happen too much in the series.  James Cromwell guests and creates a much more memorable Cochrane than the guy in the original series.  Alfre Woodard also guests as Lily, a 21st century woman who gets taken up to the Enterprise.  Her amazement feels so genuine! <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie rocks!  It easily is the best of the Next Gen films (although Nemesis is a very close second).
0812548094|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked 'Wizards First Rule' and this one didnt dissapoint either. The characters are very likeable and the story moves along at a good pace. With plenty of action and dialouge, this book lives up to the first of the series. The reason this was not a five star book, is the ending seemed rushed a little, wich doesnt matter that much because the journey is much more intriguing than the outcome. Also, I have heard alot of complaints about Goodkinds tendency to reflect on events already taken place in the previous books, and it starts in this book. I am almost done with the third book 'Blood of the Fold' and its continually becoming more frequent. This however is not a good enough reason to miss this series. If you love fantasy, than you will enjoy this book.
B0000DBJ2B|3.0|Wow.  I love fantasy and I love Jim Henson, but I was really disappointed by this movie.<br /><br />It's an architypical Joseph Campbell myth of the fight between Good and Evil involving two of the last of the race of Gelflings as they try to return a broken shard to the Dark Crystal to repair it before darkness takes over the world.  The movie has a lot of heart, but at times it comes too close to Star Wars for comfort.  Of course both of them are built upon the same rubric, but this film even has images, sounds, and characters almost exactly like Star Wars.  It doesn't really make it feel special.<br /><br />Also, the voice acting in the puppets didn't really come out as roundly as I feel other Jim Henson movies have been.  This movie, if done with real actors with the same style of acting in motion as in voice, would probably be major camp.<br /><br />However, despite my qualms, I just can't help enjoying it.  Henson and Oz's visualness is at full form here, especially in the forest, full of thousands of different and colorful set pieces, creatures, and things breathing, moving, and living.  Many things in this movie are creepy, majestic, magical, weird, gross, and funny all where they're supposed to be.  The world itself seems to follow its own natural laws, which is always appreciated in a work of fantasy.<br /><br />It gets points for heart and imagination, but otherwise Henson has done a lot better.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0375831002|5.0|A great book- for anyone. The book is about many things- courage and love being two of them.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|This movie was much better than I expected.  Really cute.   Better with subtitles turned on, since it is sometimes hard to understand. <br /> <br />It arrived about a week after expected time, which was a shame, since it arrived after my son's birthday.   <br /> <br />We still enjoyed it, and find ordering through Amazon easy.
0060987464|5.0|Well, not so much him as his image.  Throughout the entire book I found myself covering many of the pictures and even avoiding viewing the cover.    That said, the book is incredible.  Despite, for some odd reason, my innate--almost unconscious, and especially irrational--fear of his image, I found myself especially intrigued by many of his 'uncommon' experiences.  He is an incredible, thoughtful writer, and though I had only casual interest in (or even knowledge of) him before, it was very cool to get a peek into his mind and thought process (and to gain an especial appreciation for his musical works with this knowledge).  I often found myself agreeing, and perhaps even looking at things in a new way.      He lays his views out well, and sticks it to his (often hypocritical and just plain *wrong*) critics with justifiably pissed-off grace.  And even through all the 'shocking' events throughout his long career he casually divulges and explains, there is a sense of true underlying morality.  And though this is non-fiction, I did get a sort of sense of a 'happy ending'.  Not in the cliche, sappy way of course, but as the book wraps up, after his self-reflection has examined and rehashed all the effed-up events of his earlier days, it seems as though there's a sort of change-for-the-better.  An enlightenment that implies he's grown into a more mature person, and he's ultimately better than many of the things that he's been a part of.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|Dire Straits are one of the greatest bands in history. Brothers in Arms is a great one from them and has 3 of their greatest in So Far Away (which i'm trying to play guitar to it), Money for Nothing, and Walk of Life. Why Worry is beautiful too, just like <br />Foreigner's Waiting For A Girl Like You. Then the last song, Brothers in Arms is pretty good anti war song. And remember, buy this with all Dire Straits til Alchemy and BBC. I hope you found this review helpful too. by.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was very small with my older brother. Later on, as I began really getting into anime, I began searching for the series and films that I'd seen those lazy afternoons of babysitting. After seeing this film for the first time in over ten years, all I can say is...AWESOME!! This film is full of action, suspense, philisophical thoughts on the very nature of life itself, AND a scene where someone trips out! Who could ask for more?! However, if you are easily offended by animated blood and violence or are under 15 or 16 years of age (mentally) and are extremely impressionable, do not view. I tried to watch this movie with my forty-something-year-old mother once, but the violent sequence at the beginning of the film freaked her out so much that I had to stop the DVD and pop in \\"Castle in the Sky\\" instead. So, if you don't mind blood and gore, and love movies with a deeper message hidden within them, rent it, buy it, do what you must, just see this anime masterpiece.
6305718954|3.0|A typical, atheist, New York woman is just going about her life, \\"liking being me,\\" when suddenly she starts having seizures... and after the fits wakes up to find wounds on her that match the wounds received by Christ.  An investigative priest comes to figure out what's happening, and the two set out to discover what's happening, ultimately uncovering a big Vatican conspiracy.<br /><br />The movie has a lot going for it, especially with an untypical character receiving the stigmata and the great cast it has built up (Patricia Arquette and Jonathan Pryce especially).  It also has Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins doing the score, but that apparent benefit is also one of the film's minor failings...  A score should undertone and strengthen a film's drama, but this movie with its excessive (and repetitive) fast-paced editing, directorial fat, and overfocus on the music makes it seem much more like an hour and a half long music video.<br /><br />That's cool if you're wanting a music video.  However, I don't imagine many people approach this film from this direction.  I would have prefered more focus on the rest of the craft of the movie, but that's just me.<br /><br />It's also slightly predictable in that not-good-predictable way.  There's one scene that seems kind of excessive but is foreshadowed earlier, though that doesn't mean it was necessary.  Overall the film just got too caught up with being some visual/musicy slamfest to slow down and think about what it was trying to do.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000F7CMRM|4.0|\\"Syriana\\" isn't the convoluted film it's accused of being, but it does require a few things of the viewer. Before you watch, you need to have accepted a few ideas about the oil industry and U.S. foreign policy that Americans have been educated not to accept. <br /> <br />First, you have to accept that the goal of the United States, and for that matter every industrialized nation on Earth, is not the peaceful advancement of civilization for its' peoples. No world power is spared - China and Russia are called out as up-and-coming players in the dirty game. Damon's character points it out clearly - every major treaty & action in the region since World War I has been about strategic access to oil. It is literally a fight to the death to determine which worldly powers control it.  <br /> <br />Second, you have to accept that oil actually is \\"running out\\". Oil wells don't exactly \\"run dry\\", but they can be depleted to the point where it's no longer trivial to continue extraction. Fewer and fewer new oil fields are being found, and the oil industry's focus has made a steady move away from exploration of new fields, and towards technologies to further exploit existing ones. This means that, while the world doesn't neccesarily face a crisis of oil shortage, the easy work is behind us; oil companies face ever more difficult, expensive technical challenges in the future in order to guarantee supply. This is known as \\"Peak Oil\\". <br /> <br />Third, you have to accept that money, power and ideology make strange bedfellows. Seedy, corrupt connections like the ones between lawyers, U.S. government officials and the oil industry would easily be dismissible as paranoid fantasy if it weren't for the rich plunder of oil. The Bob Baer character finds himself surrounded by enemies within his own agency, but a friend to a coup plotter. Damon's character allows the promise of radical change in the region to split apart his family. The incongruity starts to make sense when viewed through the lens of Syriana.  <br /> <br />And last, you have to accept that in a struggle such as this one, all parties are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve what they see as the right ends. <br /> <br />This film has been lauded as a \\"wake up call\\" about America's complicity in the violent regional conflicts surrounding oil-rich nations; I don't think it's that. No smoking gun is revealed, no single event demonized, no accusation is made. You will learn nothing new here if you've glanced at a copy of The Economist or The New York Times in the last 20 years. I don't think the aim here was to \\"lift the blanket\\" off of a problem most Americans are already willing to acknowledge exists. <br /> <br />And to call the film \\"unamerican\\" is short-sighted as well. Everyone finds a straw man to beat; journalist Amir Tehiri considers it anti-Arab. Capitalists would call it \\"anti-capitalist fantasy\\". It's hard to sustain any of these claims, because nothing in the film is really that shocking. Americans have woken up to new charges of corruption, globalism and anti-Arab violence in the papers every single day of 2006.  A simple reading of practicallly any newspaper in the U.S. today would indicate massive corruption, illegality and doublespeak on the part of government and industry oil-related or not, that far outstrips any controversial aspect of the film Syriana. If you have to concoct a criticism of Syriana as to its realism, you would have to conclude that the film itself is far too tame. <br /> <br />The criticism most frequently leveled at this movie is that it's convoluted, hard to follow, maybe intentionally confusing. I didn't find that to be the case - in fact, you only need a basic understanding of oil and geopolitics in order to follow the story. I found the large number of characters to be a stumbling point though. Also, some of the story's most critical junctures involving kingmaker Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer's character) are quickly glossed over and left (maybe intentionally) vague. In a traditional film, Whiting would be the villain, and it's unfair I think to leave him so unconnected. One would assume that Whiting is the nexus of powerful forces in the oil industry lobby, the U.S. government and the oil-producing states, but it's all to vague to be certain. We are left to guess at the exact nature of what is, essentially, the hand pulling all of the strings. In a film where every plot device has a clear real-world analog, it's unfair to leave ambiguous such a central point.  <br /> <br />\\"Traffic\\" shared this problem. Such is the nature of Gaghan's finger-pointing. The weighty bundle of innuendo is often left to hang by a precious thread, unconnected to reality and dangling precipitously.
B00023B1LC|5.0|i'm not normally a fan of the espionage/action genre but there is just too much to like about bourne identity. <br /> <br />the plot itself is excellent, with plenty of hairpin turns, suspense and surprise to engage. the ever-shifting european scenery adds another dimension. lastly, the strong performances all round, first & foremost by matt damon, make this a must-see.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD is a lot of fun. I like each of these artists but was still suprised at how good they are togrther. It works well at any volume but some of the songs, This Is Us and Red Staggerwing really benifit from some extra DB's.
B000002MJR|5.0|I always thought this and On Every Street was all you need. but no, Dire Straits are great with all good albums til Alchemy and BBC. This is a terrific live recording from the On Every Street <br />world tour 1991-92 has a great live version of Heavy Fuel, Money <br />for Nothing, and Calling Elvis. I highly recommend you get this <br />along with Metallica Black Album, Foreigner 4, Nirvana Nevermind, and GNR Greatest Hits. DIRE STRAITS ROCK.. <br />ps. this one is much better than Alchemy or BBC so get this <br />live recording today. <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Van Helsing is a pretty good flick. You've got plenty of action, some nice suspenseful parts, and a valient attempt to squish in the entire Universal Studios monster squad, but... The plot wasn't perfect, I'll admit that. I would have liked to see a little more romance between our protagonist and his supposed love interest. Also, much more character development on both the sides of good and evil. I mean, Dracula was alright... but he kind of came off as your typical, maniacal, Saturday morning cartoonish villain. He seemed like he'd taken evil lessons from Casanova Frankenstein from \\"Mystery Men\\". Too much mad, not enough mastermind. <br /> <br />And the ending. I don't want to spoil it but basically, If you hate when all the werewolves in a flick either get killed off or turn back human at the end, this film will disappoint you. This is definitely not a good werewolf flick, seeing as how the werewolf concept and two thirds of the werewolves themselves are severely underdeveloped. Really, it seems they were stuck in as an afterthought and suffered from the overcrowding of characters in the film. Too many characters to decently develop in a two hour time frame. But, if you just need a movie to kill a few hours, rent it or borrow it from a friend who has it...it's not really worth the thirteen or so bucks to own it. Plus, the menue screen sucks!
B000FGGE68|2.0|Too many of these films are coming out where a hot babe  kicks butt against evil forces. Whether is Charlize Theron in Aeon Flux, Kate Beckinsale in Underworld, Underworld Evolution, or Kristiana Loken in Bloodrayne, and with the exception of Under world Evolution,  Aeon Flux, Bloodrayne, and Ultravoilet crapped out in the box office.  Why did this movie crap out?  Too much eye candy and not enough substance.<br /><br />  All the fight scenes were way too over the top, with confusing camera work and an over choreographed moves.  The Cgi used in this film was good in some areas and bloody cheesy in others.  Good Cgi was some of the city scapes, and some of the weaponry that form out of dimensional ports in Milas uniform. thats about it.  The other Cgi used was reminiscent of the CGI used in Stephen Kings the Lawnmower man....yeah crap!<br /><br />  So whats the thin plot? Mila plays Voilet, sort of a man made vampire called a hemophage that tries to keep this kid alive because his blood has what it takes to either cure her or kill humanity.  Its all very tongue in cheek.  while protecting the boy Voilet is constantly chased by the Vice Cardinal, kind of a corporate bad guy. its almost one fight scene after another either with guns or swords, sometimes both.<br /><br />  The only thing that makes this movie kind of cool is the technology used.  Demensional storage, gravity boosters, holographic phones, disposable phones amongst other gadgets.<br /><br />Mila is absolutely stunning in this film looks great with the straight black hair with bangs, and through out most of this film she has that \\"Star trek\\" Glow when the do closeups of her face. As far as unrated extended cut goes, there wasn't too much more added from the theatrical release that made this film memorable.  Bottom Line....gratuitous special effects(even if the suck) doesn't mean the film is any good.  O.k. for a rental.
0142001104|5.0|don't lump this in the self-help or dime-a-dozen leadership category. this is a unique, inspiring and thought-provoking book about life drawing on the experience of conductor extraordinaire ben zander and his wife rosamund. <br /> <br />i was led to this book by a brief documentary about the zanders i saw at a leadership training camp. the ideas are original and will stay with you a long time. this is the kind of book that once you read it, the world seems a little bit brighter.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This film got mixed reviews upon release back in '04 and I finally got around to seeing it last night when I plopped it in my DVD player and played it through the little flatscreen unit next to my treadmill.<br /><br />I had no expectations at all so I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was.  I expected something like a 1930's Flash Gordon type cliff hanger, and it was very much like that.<br /><br />The visuals are beautiful; the story moves briskly along but the plot is sufficiently developed given the kind of movie it is.  I loved the gadgets!  The music was completely appropriate and enjoyable and fit the retro cliff hanger atmosphere.  I could tell a lot of work went into this movie.<br /><br />And, guess what?  The actors could actually act!  I didn't think they acted quite as well as they could have, but it must have been difficult since probably much of their acting was done in front of a blue screen.  They must have had to imagine what many of the scenes were going to end up looking like.  So, I deducted one star due to the fact that we had accomplished actors very obviously (to me anyway) not doing their best work.  They seemed way to relaxed way too much of the time considering the danger they were surrounded by for much of the story.<br /><br />So, it's a fun film, and a great way to walk away 400 calories.<br /><br />Postscript:  Bonus features are neat!  There is a multi-part documentary on the making of the movie which is an interesting and inspiring story in and of itself.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|This is a good one from them, but not their best one. I think the best songs are Tunnel of Love, Expresso Love, and Solid Rock. <br />I also like Romeo and Skateaway good but maybe not as much as those 3. Go get this with every one til alchemy or BBC then quit. <br />You can also get this with any Metallica, Foreigner, Nirvana, or <br />GNR CD too, they rock just as hard as Dire Straits. Get them all. <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin have produced what will be one of my favorite albums this year. In every song, you hear his age, and how he has abused his body over the years. His missing of June is almost palpable. And yet, even with all the sadness and pain, the album gives us hope. Johnny Cash was a very spiritual man, and his faith comes shining through. \\"Rose of my Heart\\" brought tears to my eyes, and Johnny brought me even more understanding of Springsteens'\\"Further Up the Road\\". I wish Johnny had done \\"Stolen Car\\". Thank you, Johnny, for being able to express your heart and soul for so many years. We love you.
0451191153|4.0|I've read Atlas Shrugged as well, and while I basically agree with her philosophy- as I've seen written before, everything is black and white with her; I disagree on this- her fiction writing is kinda dull. She's a better non fiction writer. If I were meriting only the interest value of the story, plot, characters, etc..., I would give it a slightly lower rating, but there are other elements that make it worthwhile. I find her characters to be 2 demensional, although Elsworth Toohey is a  fascinating character. Fountainhead is a more entertaining read in this sense than Atlas Shrugged. For those who've read Atlas will understand when I say that, still speaking only in terms of 'flow', for lack of a better word, something is lost when the plot is interupted by a 20-30-40-50 page, or more, monologue in which the character expounds on his philosophy. While academically interesting the flow is broken.She claimed that her stories were not merely vehicles for her philosophy but they are definitely secondary. I give the Fountainhead 3.8 stars.
B00006J3WH|5.0|The cd is fun music to listen to when you're on the road or just hanging out.  The cast itself was good, but to me the best songs of the cd is Hinton Battle singing \\"What you feel\\" and \\"Under Your Spell\\".  I just pulled this CD out of my collection recently and loved every song again.  Every Buffy fan must own this CD.
B000003TAL|2.0|This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams...
B00004Y6NX|4.0|Less well known than other Dire Straits recordings, this album contains some gems.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This CD gives me hope that there is still invention,  discovery and risk-taking pioneering in modern music!  I have long tired of the refried-regurgitated   hip-hop/R&B/Pop sampling and re-sampling of   the samples trend that has kept urban pop and R&B   in a state of arrested development  for the past 15 yrs now!   This album is like much needed water  after a drought, and I hope it will inspire   others, no matter what type of music they create,   to be daring & original and to plant a    flag (creatively!) for the 21st Century!
B000002A3T|5.0|Given that \\"The Division Bell\\" was released over a decade ago, one can listen to it now with the same reverence and appreciation that should be afforded to every Pink Floyd release.  Pre-DSOTM fans have always viewed Pink Floyd to be a creative unit of four individuals.  Seeing the band transformed first into Roger's group and then, with his departure, into David's has not been easy.  Still, most of us have continued to appreciate the musical progression of Pink Floyd during this process all the while marveling at the genius of this incredible group.  \\"The Division Bell\\" is in many ways a synopsis of the band's progression through these changes with familiar elements and themes being expanded upon and then drawn to a conclusion in what I consider to be truly a crowning moment for them.<br /><br />I would submit that \\"The Division Bell\\" is the ideal companion to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" both musically and thematically.  This is due in large part to the fact that \\"The Division Bell\\" is once again a group effort.  Finally getting to hear Rick Wright on vocals again is a special treat.  His composition \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" is ideally suited for him and is one of the many highlights on this album.  Rick's understated contributions on piano and keyboards, first evident on the beautifully eerie opening number \\"Cluster One\\", and Nick Mason's work on drums throughout add to the overall balance of this album which features some of David Gilmour's most haunting guitar solos since \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  The instrumental \\"Marooned\\", which has already been mentioned by several other reviewers as being worthy of note, is a prime example of Gilmour's work.  The song \\"Keep Talking\\" will take you back to the \\"Wish You Were Here\\"/\\"Animals\\" era with its soaring keyboards and aggressive guitar passages.  \\"Poles Apart\\" and \\"Lost For Words\\", both obvious overtures to one not present, are masterfully constructed and delivered openly and with a sense of both vulnerability and sad resignation by Mr. Gilmour.<br /><br />From start to finish, all of the songs on \\"The Division Bell\\" flow together to produce a cohesive and interesting musical masterpiece.  Highly recommended.gnation by Mr. Gilmour.   <br /> <br />From start to finish, all of the songs on \\"The Division Bell\\" flow together to produce a cohesive and interesting musical masterpiece.  Highly recommended. <br />
B00005JOQS|4.0|Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.<br /><br />The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.<br /><br />The Plot, in Short:<br />Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.<br /><br />Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.<br /><br />Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.<br /><br />However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as \\"love to hate.\\" It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series \\"Smallville,\\" and not the traditional Superman I remember.<br /><br />Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.<br /><br />Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for \\"Why the World No Longer Needs Superman.\\" She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.<br /><br />Perry Mason isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.<br /><br />A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Superman Returns.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
1400032717|2.0|I picked this book up at a discount used bookstore hoping to really love it.....based on all the reviews and comments I had seen online. The book itself even has pages and pages of rave reviews.....For me it just didn't work. I appreciate the story and what the author is trying to accomplish, and he does accomplish it. It's a very real look at an autistic life. Christopher is a well developed character. I thought the story lacked luster and ended abruptly. But, it's a quick and easy read. I would not recommend this book. I found it somewhat painful to get through. Maybe that's part of the point. You feel dreadfully stuck in the mind of an autistic person and for that I respect it greatly.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|My first name is Wolf is it any doubt that I side firmly with the Lycan's.  So of course this movie was a reel disapointment since the Lycan's are made to look so one demensional, easy to kill and just plain tame in Evolution.  The Lycan's come off so bad in Underworld - Evolution  because, the writers were either lazy or just did not give a damn about the story they were telling.  Lycan's have depth, feral intelligence and a charmingly brutish demension something you saw plenty of in the first Underworld that is totally lacking in Underworld - Evolution.  Watching the Lycans in Underworld - Evolution  was like watching the old civil war re-enactment films where you see guys get wandering around mindlessly waiting to get shot and after they are shot they get back up.  The writers did not bother to make the Lycan's belivable in Underworld - Evolution  and the end product suffers for their laziness.<br /><br />This version of Underworld came close to betraying the storyline it established. I really got into the blood war between the lycan's and the vampires. Underworld - Evolution did not really improve on the core theme of the Underword franchise, it went off in new and often times boring directions.<br /><br />It was action packed if you are on the side of the Vampires but this movie made the Lycans look too tame, stupid and without the primally motivated pack mentality that made Lycan's so believable and such fun to watch in the first Underworld - Evolution movie.  The story was still good do not get me wrong but watching Underworld - Evolution was like asking for and expecting one thing and getting something else instead.<br /><br />I suspect most people were expecting Underworld - Evolution  to shed more light on the war between Lycan's and Vampires and this movie went off on its own wierd tangient.  This movie while good had little of the originality of the first Underworld.  The new ALPHA of the Lycans was so lame the screen writers should have been fired for producing such dreack.  Business 101 suggests you should have hired writers with a passion for making a continuation of the Underworld adventure and not just slap dash something together to fill up time on the screen.<br /><br />This was a ok movie but nothing great.  To Lycan fans this movie is still worth having but only barely.  The bad writing in Underworld - Evolution  really hurt the character development of Lycan's for which the those involved in Underworld - Evolution should be ashamed.  This movie was made purely for profit by people who did not really LOVE the messages, characters and subtle interplay in this movie.  I love Underworld but Evolution was not fully evolved when it was committed to video and it shows big time.  All in all I still brought Underworld - Evolution  and would advise any Underworld fan to forgive its flaws because it is still plenty enjoyable to watch.n fired for producing such dreack.

B000054BGW|5.0|First and foremost for me is the bringing back of the vocal styling of bands like Canned Heat and the Sir Douglas Quintet that turned me on to QOTSA, but you can't deny the quality of the musicians and songwriting.  By Rated R the band has really come together. <br /> <br />For me, which is typical, the first album is the best.  Rated R and Songs For The Deaf are \\"better\\" if that makes sense.  What I mean is the first album shows the enthusiasium of the new band and a creative explosion in songwriting that really culminated with Rated R and Songs.  In a non manufactured Top 40 world easily a half dozen songs from both Rated R and Songs could have been hit singles. <br /> <br />Rated R is a rock tour de force that showcases a band at their creative pinnacle that continues with Songs For The Deaf.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|They did it again. This is no doubtely the best punk album since Rise Against previous 2 album releases. It offers a lot of depth and provides the listener with lyrics that are less \\"traditional.\\" Nearly every song is my favorite but \\"Survive\\" really does it for me. I'm not gonna explain. enjoy.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Wonderful requested gift from our teenage granddaughter.  She loved the DVD and the movie.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I've never read In Cold Blood--only a few short stories and excerpts from Answered Prayers. By the time I was old enough to be aware of who Truman Capote was, he was an object of scorn and ridicule by the popular press and had alienated most of his socialite friends because of Answered Prayers.<br /><br />So for a long time, it was a mystery to me how this broken, alcoholic could once have been so celebrated.<br /><br />There are many layers and nuances in this film but the classic tragedy is what has stayed with me the longest. Truman Capote makes the essential Faustian bargain: he receives the fame and praise he so desperately seeks by lying and manipulating but once he gets what he wants: a book that sets new conventions for True Crime stories, he can't live with himself.<br /><br />This is so beautifully played out in the movie's climax when Capote visits the two men immediately prior to their executions. He tries to say something and can only manage choked sobs. It is Perry, the man about to be hung, that consoles Capote.<br /><br />Another point raised during the film is that Truman Capote was not without people who genuinely loved and cared about him. In particular, his lover, Jack Dunphy and his childhood friend, Harper Lee. But it isn't enough and by running after what he wanted but didn't need, Capote essentially anniliates himself.<br /><br />In our celebrity-obsessed culture, this film quietly and truthfully paints a picture of the price many pay for seeking the illusion.
0525457585|5.0|i got this book when i was in fourth grade, and trying to find something that looked interesting. i looked on the summer reading table, and saw The Neverending Story. i remembered this title from the tv show they had on HBO Family and so i bought it. WARNING:if you liked the show or movie, you  <br />WILL be blown away!!! I started the book and was imediatly intranced. the imagination, creativity, and beauty put into this book is mindblowing. i couldnt put it down. from the title page, to the last page i was intranced. the charactors were so real i thought that i could just be walking down the street and if i saw them i would immediatly be able to reconize them. when you get halfway through the book and you think its over, you find the secound 'half' that i thing is much better than the first. its plot is unique, the charactors seem like best friends, the setting as wonderfull and diverse as the rainforest, and at the end you cry, because you feel as though your best friend has just moved away...
B000002LFZ|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits was of course excellent, but didn't include some of the songs that I had hoped for.  I guess some of the songs are solely Stevie and not Fleetwood.  I wish they included both!!!!!
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolfmother have released an important work for 2006.This disc does not fit the current trends and that's a good thing.This is a traditional hard rock release but there are enough touches(Hammond organ and flute, no less) to give the band a distinct style.While the vocals are high-pitched they are strong and not the least bit grating and the songs do not run together because the tracks are somewhat diverse yet still cohesive.I look forward to future releases with the confidence that this band will be here for years to come.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|The performances in this film are awesome. I was initally irritated that Joaquin Phoenix was cast in a role that seemed too big for him; in fact too big for most actors to attempt. But he truly melts into the role and I felt like I was getting a glimpse into Cash as a human being beyond his performance persona.<br /><br />Phonix and Reese Witherspoon are wonderful together as Johnny Cash and June Carter. The chemistry between the two feels very real and natural. June Carter was an amazing woman and artist and Reese Withespoon gives you a sense of both her talent, grit, and vulnerability. Good as she was, Reese Witherspoon's performance didn't seem worthy of a best actress Oscar.<br /><br />As enjoyable as the movie was, I found myself getting restless by the second half. I began to feel like I was seeing the same scene over and over again. Johnny Cash does drugs, gets in trouble, disapoints June, and pleads with her not to leave. However well acted, I didn't get any sense of growth or progress in Johnny Cash.<br /><br />The ending also makes it sound like \\"and they got married and lived happily ever after\\" Johnny Cash still had a stint in prison , a few relapses, other problems ahead of fim although there's no doubt that June and his children went a long way towards moderating his excesses.<br /><br />So great performances, nice sense of \\"being there\\" during some CW history in the making but leaves an enormous gap between the elderly Cash who had come to a level of peace with his demons and the more experienced but still wrestling with demons Cash we see at the end of the film.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I would say this plot offers up more suspense and intriguing details than any Tom Clancy movie I've ever seen. It wasn't until about an hour into the story that things finally started to make sense. But, from that point on, I was hanging onto every word and piecing together every detail.    The trick to understanding this movie before it's over is to remember the names. Once you get to the point when you know who's who, everything else unfolds from there.    So, what's going on?    Matt Damon is a financial advisor to Prince Nassir. Prince Nassir's family just approved a deal for the chinese to come in and set up shop as oil drillers, as the chinese offered the highest bid.    However, the US wants to cut the chinese out of the picture so that the newly merged connex and the smaller oil company can do their thing in place of the chinese.    So, now we're at that scene when the old guy is talking to Prince Nassir's younger brother on the yacht. What you have to infer is that the \\"wish\\" that Nassir's younger brother wants the \\"cat's paw\\" to grant is to have his older brother, Prince Nassir, assassinated. In return for the favor, the US will get the oil contract instead of the chinese.    That's when the CIA have George Clooney arrange for Prince Nassir to be assassinated. However, you know that doesn't work out. You might recall the torture scene. After Clooney narrowly escapes certain death, the torturer threatens to reveal the CIA's assassination attempt to the media.    Next we see Clooney threatening the old man in the cafe. A trusted former co-worker had informed Clooney that the old man is setting him up to be the fall guy for any negative backlash resulting from the exposure of the failed assassination attempt.    Once Clooney is able to get his passports back, he attempts to intercept Prince Nassir on the desert freeway and warn him of the danger to his life. In the freeway scene, Nassir has re-established relations with the Chinese; and with the help of 9 outof 11 of the country's generals, he is attempting to de-throne his conniving, ambitious younger brother.    So, everything else is pretty much straightforward.    Syrania illustrates the following points of controversy:    1. The US uses its intelligence community resources to eliminate opposition to its oil interests.    2. US government watchdogs are helpless to make an impact on anti-trust violations committed by oil companies, while the intelligence community acts as an accomplice to those violations.    3. The US strategically ensures that oil producing countries do not improve their infrastructure, economy..etc., so as to keep them more easily controlled.    Again, those are the points of view illustrated by this movie; they are not my own.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Humans have always had their beloved titans in the arts and humanities. We love to revere the masters, so much so that certain artists, writers, musicians, composers, filmmakers, etc. are bound to become overrated. The real task becomes the identification and appreciation of the genuine articles, those precious few whose works need no champions, no defenders, as they speak of their own greatness with sublime eloquence. J. S. Bach, to my mind, epitomizes this authenticity. His six suites for solo cello are like philosophy expressed through music, and dance music at that! <br /> <br />Pierre Fournier's playing manages to reconcile accessibility and beauty with an unmatched sentiment of art and elegance. Vladimir Nabokov said that all great novels were fairy tales; many great compositions are no different. Fournier plays the opening prelude like a sunrise, like a rapturous yet peace-filled \\"once upon a time...\\". This is music of images, to be cherished and accepted, like a gift. Highly recommended.
B00005JOSS|1.0|My husband and I went to see this movie-he fell asleep an hour into the movie and I witnessed 2 couples walk out of the movie.  If you pay attention to this movie, you can guess where the plot is heading within the first 10 minutes.  There are alot of holes in the plot which leave you asking, If she's smart enough to be a doctor(Sandra Bullock), why didn't she look up medical records also, if you worked on saving someone's life and they died and you were devasted wouldn't you know who they were?-this will make sense if you see the movie. Could have been a great movie but missed!
0689865384|5.0|\\"This whole game is just designed to make us hate ourselves.\\"<br /><br />In a civilization roughly 300 years from now Tally Youngblood is about to turn 16 years old. In her culture,  when  a child turns 16, they are subjected to a brutal operation that shaves away excess bone, eats away the layers of skin (including any scars, freckles, or age lines), and replaces any unattractive features with beautiful, hard plastic, pretty features. This is known as becoming a \\"Pretty\\".<br /><br />As an \\"Ugly\\", Tally has looked forward to this all of her life. Born and bred in a culture that loathes unattractiveness she is taught from a young age to embrace the upcoming change as a means of combating the horrible ego crushing things that generations of children long past had to deal with, things that included racism, depression, and eating disorders to maintain some warped ideal of beauty.  She, like other young Uglies, spends her days in school in a sheltered  compound, learning from the histories of her predecessors the \\"Rusties\\", an ancient civilization who erected metal monuments to live in, cut down trees as a means of producing paper and wasting more than their fair share of it, and teaching their youth that in order to be beautiful you had to torture yourself. The better part of Tally's time leading up to her birthday is spent playing pranks on the younger Uglies and sneaking into New Pretty Town. Here, she spends the time yearning to join the New Pretties, including her former best friend Peris, and tries to stay out of trouble long enough to make it to her operation, which is only a few months away.<br /><br />One day Tally meets a skinny young woman named Shay, and discovers they both share the same birthday. They immediately bond as they share their experiences and Shay teaches Tally to hover board. What they do not share is their viewpoints on becoming a Pretty. Whereas Tally cannot wait for the operation Shay seems to think it is unnecessary, largely due to her interaction with an outsider named David who has lived in the wild all of his life. Tally tries to soften her mind to the operation, but does not succeed. When Shay decides to run away to the Smoke (the place where David is) she attempts to convince Tally to come with her, to little success. Tally wants the operation, and promises Shay she will not share where she went with any others.<br /><br />The day of the operation comes, and much to Tally's dismay there is a problem. She is taken before the Special Circumstances Committee. Here she meets a Dr. Cable, a woman whose beauty is so sharp it is almost cruel. Dr. Cable knows about Shay, and forces Tally into a bargain with her. Unless Tally finds Shay, and as a result the Smoke, Tally will never become a Pretty. Tally, naturally, feels like a traitor, but she agrees to undertake the mission to infiltrate the Smoke and bring the Specials to it, with the help of a pendant with an optical sensor in it. But, will Tally's heart and mind change once she is in the company of her old friend, and more importantly, once she hears what David and the others really have to reveal about the Specials, the Pretties, and the ever important operation.<br /><br />\\"But first you see my face. You react to symmetry , skin tone, the shape of my eyes. And then you decide what's inside me, based on all your reactions. You're programmed to!<br /><br />I'm not programmed. I didn't grow up in a city.<br /><br />It's not culture, it's evolution!\\"<br /><br />This book has all sorts of thematic levels to it. There is, of course, the conformity issues that arise from everyone having an operation to have their features changed to fit to a certain standard. Along with this, of course, the personalities are altered as a result of the sudden ego boosts. Now, this may seem a little similar to \\"The Stepford Wives\\", but to me it has more of an apocalyptic \\"1984\\" quality. While the current culture has their troubles with the operations it is only a result of what the previous, less ecologically and biologically friendly culture did to the environment and the people as a result of their own evolution. I was surprised and a tad ashamed to have this look at what a culture might think of when they look back at ours, even if it is only through the lens of a fictitious novel. What I gleaned from this book overall was that this is a fantastic premise, storyline, narrative, and tremendous achievement overall for Westerfield, and I intend to read the subsequent books in the near future, likely after I have had some time to process this book.it is only a result of what the previous, less ecologically and biologically friendly culture did to the environment and the people as a result of their own evolution.

B000031WI8|5.0|There are often times where there are so many great acts, but there aren't that many reliable, and definitive greatest hits record for those artists. That has been the case with so many great performers within the past couple of years from acts like Britney Spears, and Madonna. Nevertheless, there are those that have delivered. That arguably has been the case with Wham! Since the duo of George Michael & Andrew Ridgeley enetered from Britain back in the 1980's, they still are a guilty pleasure for anybody to get up and dance to. Although the group hasn't reunited, the songs are still good enough to sing with. This collection of their songs says so.<br /><br />Wham's The Final is a real well-definitive reflection of George Michael & Andrew Ridgeley, and what this great group shine back in the 1980's. The songs here have all been restored, and remastered very well here. Unlike other hits packages from Wham, this record has delivered without anything overlooked. All the great classics are highlighted here like Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, the soulful Careless Whisper, The Edge Of Heaven, Bad Boys, Young Guns (Go For It), I'm Your Man, and Everything She Wants, Club Tropicana, and Freedom. Unlike the 1997 WHam hits package, this one is the one that still remains definitive.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is quite sad that the Wham's The Final hasn't been released here in America, unless it is a import. This is a great collection, and well worth buying for anyone who loved the group, or if you are just a fan of 80's music, I absolutely love this record a whole lot.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: A<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: A-
0140284095|4.0|Not the funniest Wodehouse I have read--but still far better than any other \\"humourist book\\" I have attempted to read by more contemporary writers, in recent memory.  Wodehouse was a master craftsman, it is always easy to picture exactly what he is writing, see the expressions on the characters faces as they utter their completely brilliant dialogue.  The back and forth arguements between Aunt Dahlia and Bertie are great.  The high point for me in this book was the scene in the famous Anatole's bedroom.<br /><br />I was pretty excited to actually encounter Anatole in this book, I don't remember having actually seen him in action in any of the other Jeeves books i have read to date (always heard of his greatness and genius though).<br /><br />The plot for this is much like any of the others for the books in this series.  Some of Bertie's friends have gotten themselves into a huge knot on the romantic front (its true, its remarkably easy to pick up the lilting affectations of Wodehouse dialogue after reading his books)  however--instead of having Jeeves fix it right away, Bertie beleives that Jeeves \\"has gone soft\\" and that it us up to Wooster to fix the problems.  While his tactics are actually quite good--he hasn't learned to anticipate the stupidity his friends are capable of when in the midst of such plots.  It isn't until the last few pages that we see Jeeves at the reigns again.  At poor Bertie's expense, as always.<br /><br />Very enjoyable read.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|The first Underworld was much better, but this one is still worth watching.
B00005JOQS|1.0|I am giving this movie one star for the special effects minus the obviously CGI flying scenes. I didn't really want to go see this mess in the first place because the lead was an unknown. But so many misguided movie goers told me that this was an excellent film. So you can imagine my dismay when I walked into the theater and paid my hard earned 11.75 to see this watered down dung heap of a film. First off, the acting was atrocious. The dialogue between the characters was abysmal and cheesy to say the least. The plot was corny and it dragged on like road kill from up under a bumper. In addition, whoever did the costume designing for superman's outfit must be blind!! His costume looked like something you could get from Walgreens around the Halloween season. Then they had the nerve to keep focusing the camera on these ugly black snow boots he was wearing. To sum up, this movie was a hot \\"nuclear explosion\\" of a mess and I would have rather spent two hours battling with constipation than be subjected to this horrific excuse for cinema.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I have Loved this move since I was a kid! and you know the thing jerith dose with the crystal balls I saw  a guy do that at a party a few years after my dad bought this movie for us so I was totaly convinced it was all real! and thruoght out my whole childhood belived hole heartedly in magic and gobblind and all that good stuff.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|On the fresh morning of May the 8th I was woken up by the radio which was playing \\"Under The Bridge\\", how I love that song, after hearing that in my bed, I leaped to my computer and starting learning all about Red Hot Chili Peppers, from that day I did not know the exsisted, so it was a very happy morning for me. <br />While I was searching for there albums on the internet, I had already ordered Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californacation, By The Way and One Hot Minute, I thought that was the only albums they had released, then I read the there newest album Stadium Arcadium was set to be realeased May the 8th, that very day! <br />I was immensly excited and instead of ordering it I went into my nearest music store and bought it at 11am. <br />By a month I had decided on my favourite off theres, at first I adored Blood Sugar Sex Magik, then I fell in love with By The Way, One Hot Minute and Californacation were very good though. <br />By this time I had listened a great deal to Stadium Arcadium, and ythought it was probably as good as Californacation, after actaully listening to the Mars disk, this album have shot up into the ranks off By The Way and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, then I heard \\"Make You Feel Better\\", and I just fell in love, after that song I started noticing others on the album like, \\"Desecration Smile\\", \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", \\"Dani California\\", \\"Wet Sand\\", \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", \\"Slow Cheetah\\" and many others, this album has really grown on me the past 2 weeks, I just hope this album is recognised, well I know it will, because it is just a great album, DEFINATELY worth the money.
B0001XWV12|3.0|I saw it and I laughed hard at a moment here and there, but some <br />of the less tasteful and less well-written plot elements (such as the green fairy)left me feeling a bit offended that the writing was not consistent and took my good mood away posthaste. <br />It was a partially-forgivable film, <br /> <br />so I suppose it deserves a C. <br /> <br />I'm just curious as to how this could have possibly looked any better on script?
B000EULJLU|1.0|This album seem to lack the drive and emotion that all of Tools past albums (and APC) possesses'. Therefore, as stupid as it may seem, I believe that this must be some sort of joke, or a metaphor. I can't honestly believe that this is the work of Maynard. The first time I heard there single \\"vicarious\\", I turned on the radio station and it was playing it, probly half way thru. And I was trying to figure out whether this was some crappy rip-off or the genuine article. Even hearing the lyrics and his singing I was still a little uncertain whether it was tool or not. But then the song ended and the dj announced that this was brand new Tool, and he was all ecstatic about it. I was in total shock, as many like me were. So empty, bland, and so repetitive! I'd go as far as to say down right boring. I really fail to see what someone may like about this album, based on his past works; this album doesn't even come close to parallel. Or this may all just be my stupid suspicion, and they just suck now. But it make sense, he did say \\"I sold out long before you ever even heard my name. I sold my soul to make a record.\\" So who really knows?
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is seriously the album of the year.  Every tune on this album is great and I think that Damien Marley is maintaining a great name for his father.  If you don't have this album already - get it!! I can't live without it and to be honest I wasn't really into this genre of music in the beginning besides Sean Paul-but now I'm addicted!
B000FGGE68|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be crap. But I think it was really good. I loved the stylish look of the film. It's not at all realistic but then it's not really cartoony either. It's like it exists in it's own world and it looks great. The action scenes were very well done. Not all dumb looking like in Aeon Flux. The one thing I didn't like was the, at times, confusing story. And the fact that this woman was practically invincible. That kind of takes away suspense. But this movie was a lot of fun.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but when I saw the negative reviews on this movie, I just had to write something. First of all, yes, this movie is somewhat complex. If you are looking for a movie which doesn't take much brain power to understand don't see Syriana; I would recommend The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (that shouldn't addle your sensitive brain). But if you are looking for a movie that has nuance and an interesting plot, then I would watch Syriana. This movie presents an interesting and unique perspective on the US's relations in the Middle East which I have in few places.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Tool is one of my favorite bands, but I was a little dissappointed with their new album release. I was hoping that it would be similiar to their previous albums. At first, when hearing the new album I was confused and it didn't sound like the Tool I know and listened to for many years. However, I still liked the new album but I only really loved one song which is plays on the radio here a lot. I think they were trying to make this album more radio friendly, in my opinion. Anyway, they are still one of my favorite bands and I look forward to hearing more albums from them. Hopefully, next time they will give us something more to what we are use to with their music. I still recommend TOOL fans to buy the new album.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Bryan Singer is an extremely bad movie director!  Superman Returns is really bad. The movie's plot is extremely poor. the special effects and CGI is the main focus of the film. There is too much focus on special effects and plot is dull and boring. Also there is scene where Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) and his thugs beat-up Superman (Brandon Routh)and Superman is stabbed by Lex Luthor using the sharp knife made of Green kryptonite. I hate these scenes were Superman is beaten by Lex Luthor's thugs and stabbed by him! Bryan Singer! What are you thinking?! Kate Bosworth is interesting as Lois Lane but is not really good.  Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder had great chemistry in Superman I and Superman II! Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth do not have enough chemistry to please the audience. I hate this movie! F    I miss Christopher Reeve as Superman, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Superman I (1978) and Superman II (1980) are best examples of great superhero movies and this movie sucks.
B0007OCG56|5.0|A movie has never touched me so much before until I watched Spanglish. As I put in the DVD into the player, I prepared myself to watch what I thought would be a falt out comedy with Adam Sandler as the star. I was wrong. It was more the character Flor played by Paz Vega that touched me more than anything. Vega is the essence of beauty. Natural beauty with her curly hair brown hair and freckled cheeks and dimple in her chin. I found myself really looking at her. Looking into Flor. <br /> <br />The movie begins with Flor's daughter Crisitna narating an essay she has written to Princeton. She sets up the movie by explaining that her mother is the person she looks up to most. I begin to think that maybe this movie is your usual rags to riches story, but it is so much more. Even as I write this now, I can't help but tear up. <br /> <br />Flor and her daughter are from Mexico. Her husband left her, which in turn has turned her into a strong independent woman. The usual cliche, true. She doesn't show her greif in front of her daughter, and when they decide to move to LA, she tells Christina that one tear is enough to shed. Flor is then hired on as a housekeeper in an upscale neighborhood for an eccentric family. Adam Sandler doesn't come into the picture until at least 20 minutes into the movie. I had almost forgot he was in this movie. I don't know why he was listed first in the credits, and Paz listed third after Tea Leoni (who looks remarkably like Naomi Watts). The whole movie is about Flor. <br /> <br />I can relate so much to Flor. The way she lives through her daughter; wanting what is best for her. Flor claches with Deb, the wife of John (Sandler) in the way two mothers compete for the adoration of their offspring. Deb is a controling manipulative exerholic who gives her attention to Cristina instead of her own daughter who she tossed aside because she isn't as thin as she wants to be. Each mother takes matters into their own hands; Deb taking Cristina out shoppingand dying her hair, while Flor lets out the hem of Deb's daughter's new clothes to make her feel special. It is always a battle between the two. <br /> <br />There are a few side stories that play into the plot. John is a chef at a 4 star restaraunt who can not express himself very well, and tends to tune out emotionally fast talkind Deb. Deb on the other hand is secretly having an affair with their realator. All the while, Deb's mother sits in the background spouting off life's wisdom. <br /> <br />Of couse, there are some laugh out loud funny moments. I loved seeing Flor learning English. Hence, Spanglish: A mixture of English and Spanish. <br /> <br />Flor never looses her cool. She a role model for all women out there. Everyone in the family is moved by her. When John tells Deb about the affair, he leaves and takes Flor to his restaraunt. He cooks her dinner and they talk all night. I never knew that food could be so sexual, but in an innocent way. Even when the intimacy steps out of the box breifly, Flor knows when to stop. She would never lower herself to the likes of Deb. She is a ritous woman. It was like in the scene where Deb and Flor are racing down the street. It was like they were racing to see who would win the family. Flor hesitated for one instant, and Deb won. \\"It was a good try, \\" Deb told Flor. Flor knew after the dinner with John, that she had to quit her job. <br /> <br />Cristina was devistated. She would never see the Clasky family again, or go to their ritzy private school. As Mother and daughter were walking to the bus stop, Cristina yells at her mother saying she ruined her life. Yet, she walks on telling Cristina calmly to come to the bus stop. Flor knows what she is doing is hard, but it is for the best. As Cristina stands there, Flor walks over to her. \\"I need some space, \\" Cristina says like many of the other characters do throughout the story. \\"No, space, \\" Flor replies in broken English. \\"I am your mother. Don't ever forget who you are.\\" <br /> <br />This was the most heartwrenching scene. Tears spilled as I watched them get on the bus, sitting in sepreate seats. Then slowly, Cristina moves over next to Flor. The movie ends with the two locked in an embrace and this line:  \\"All I know is that I am my mother's daughter.\\" <br /> <br />I usually toss movies aside when I watch them. Yes, there are some good ones out there, but none that I could hold high on a pedistool. Spanglish is by far one of the best movies of all time.  <br />
B00005JM02|2.0|At the beginning of the film, a barracuda devours Nemo's mother and all his siblings.  Only his father and the unhatched Nemo are left.  The deaths are not shown, but the great emptiness afterward is.  More scares follow, as Nemo ventures off the safe reef and is scooped up by a huge scuba diver looming like a cliff.<br /><br />Supporting characters are more annoying than funny.  The end is completely predictable.
0060589280|5.0|Whether you like the Paulo Coeho's novel or not, \\"Eleven minutes\\" is a book you should not miss. There are many books discussing what love should be. However, after reading this book, you will find them are very primitive and nothing speical. The book nakely and deeply discuss what love and sex is and should be.
0783225849|5.0|Alfred hitchcokc's terrifiying movie is now on a special edition dvd that has many features , spanish subtitles,a 1:85:1  widescreen format and french auidio track ( of course also available in english)    This DVD shines in everything: the picture sound is excellent and The movie is great ,beutifully remastered.  The shower scene is still terrifiying and also the killer's many appeareances.The DVD has making off feature , a theatrical trailer,storyboards and production notes.    The music score is creepy in every way.  In conclusion this is a MUST BUY!
B000ESSTL0|2.0|I'm always excited to see older albums being remastered and rereleased, especially with previously unavailable material. The last few years have seen a wealth of such releases from many of my favorite Eighties acts like Eurythmics, the Cure, and now Depeche Mode. Violator in particular is my favorite DM album - I find it to be the pinnacle of their artistry. But I must say this version is quite disappointing. The main cd is perfect as it is - it didn't need remastering, and I honestly can't hear any difference in this and the cd I bought back in the early 90's. The DVD is what roped me into buying this package, and it's just a letdown on many levels. The documentary is a teaser, and  much too short. Violator could be the subject of one of those \\"Classic Album\\" type films all by itself, with hours of interviews and details. Instead what we get here are very brief interviews and  a rehash of much of the music from the album, with videos shown that were actually used as stage projections during the Violator tour. The 5.1 mix is a poor choice for this material, putting too much artificial sounding seperation on the vocals and instruments - it's simply doesn't sound good, and brings absolutely nothing new to the experience. As far as I'm concerned, the Francois Kervorkian mix IS the definitive mix of Violator, and in the words of someone I once knew who is much smarter than I am, \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"
B00005MAM2|4.0|If you have seen this movie when it came out like i did then this is a big deal!!! what was wrong with the english dialouge that it had to be re-recorded??!! i saw this at a local theater here in san antonio when it came out years ago, and when it came out on DVD i snatched it up to my dismay i realized that it had a new audio track. what a travesty, it has never been the same. a classic destroyed!! you wouldn't replace the audio to Casablanca would you?

B000EULJLU|5.0|Crank it up!   No one can produce the sounds, lyrics and power in a way that Tool does - this is no exception.  Very cool packaging just adds more to the experience.   Must have CD for all those who enjoy heavy, melodic and powerful music.
B000002KBH|4.0|For a studio release this was great....     Having only seen the Dead in the post Brent days,  I can only image the energy in the pig-pen, Wavy Gravy,  Good Rev. days.......    <br /> <br />If you've never listened to the dead......  what are you waiting for?   It's not a social stigma to like good music.....
B000002U82|5.0|Every track on here is great i never skip a song. Its like your part of the album it pulls you in and it feels like your listening to a story. DSOTM is a album anybody like learn to love the music is perfect. Excellent lyrics and it was amazing with all the special effect noises. Rick Wright was awesome with his work. This isup there with the top three Floyd albums
B000EULJLU|5.0|Listening to it as I type this, just as I listen to it in just about any other circumstance one could think of (during a professor's lecture, while playing poker at a casino that prohibits portable music players, while golfing (weather-permitting), while driving, plus all the places that people might normally listen to music).  I think I've listened to it every day since I bought it, a few days after its early May release.  Jambi has been played close to 1,000 times.  It's not even my favorite song on the album, just so addictive that I find myself pressing the repeat buttong 3-4 times before moving on to what actually is my favorite song, the two-part Wings for Marie masterpiece.  To all the critics of this album, of whom there are surprisingly many given the loyalty of Tool fans and my feeling that this is a near-flawless album, I'd like to hear some comments as to how Wings for Marie, Part II especially, does NOT move you enough to induce you to grant this album 5 stars on the basis of that song along.  Comment on my review; I'd really like to hear an explanation.  Because, contrary to what Maynard sings in the climax of Wings Part II, in this case, I feel the burden of proof is on the non-believers.      Oh, and the rest of the songs are great...Rosetta Stoned is remarkable.  Especially if you juxtapose it with Wings, for kicks...amazing the same band could do both those songs.  The Pot is not about weed (last lyrics: \\"ganja, please!  you must have been out your mind!\\"...implying that the person Maynard is condemning \\"must have been so high\\" on something much more potent than weed...), but rather hypocrisy, as in the pot calling the kettle black (\\"when you pissed all over my black kettle...\\").  The lyrical twist of that song alone makes it good, but it's complemented by music of equal caliber...the last 30 seconds of that song probably stand out along with the last minute or so of Jambi as my favorite moments on the CD.  Well, and the 17+ minutes of Wings.pauses to listen to climax of Wings Part II...proceeds    The fact that the two songs I've saved for last, Vicarious and Right In Two, are listed by many as standout tracks speaks volumes about the overall quality of the album.  And they are, except, they don't stand out quite enough from previous efforts that Maynard's had a hand in for me to give them full praise: Vicarious' bass line is, as has been pointed out numerous times, very similar to Schism's; and Right in Two [Lipan] conjures up memories of A Perfect Circle, for me anyway.  But on any given day, I might repeat either of these songs the most, too.    Bottom line: at this point, probably my favorite album ever, even over all my treasured grunge albums (Jar of Flies by Alice in Chains is especially noteworthy), NIN, Floyd, Zeppelin, and every other Tool and A Perfect Circle record.  Lateralus is maybe the album I'd argue to be the best I've ever heard, but this is my favorite, if that distinction makes any sense.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I first heard of Rise Against when they released their song Swing Life Away, and I must say I wasn't impressed.  Then I saw a documentary on The Used and Rise Against as they were on the Taste of Chaos Tour in Australia and I heard their song Give it all. What a song, I bought the album (SSOTCC), and I thoroughly enjoyed the album.  Now comes The Sufferer and The Witness and what an album it is. <br /> <br />1. Chamber the cartridge; kicks off the album with a huge bang, one of the best songs on the album 4.5/5 <br />2. Injection; catchy punk rock anthem that will stick in your head for ages, 4.5/5 <br />3. Ready to fall; first single off the album, again a punk rock anthem very catchy, 4.5/5 <br />4. Bricks; a quick punk song thats full of fury, 4.5/5 <br />5. Under the knife; good song, kinda poppy but I'm a sucker for a catchy pop/rock song, 3.5/5 <br />6. Prayer of the rufugee; Very interesting, I really really like this song, one of my favs, contrast between verse and chorus is really awesome 5/5 <br />7. Drones; favourite song off the album, fantastic; 5/5 <br />8. The approaching curve; 2nd fav off the album, rise against get a but experimental and it definitely pays off, 5/5 <br />9. Worth dying for; Punk song, fantastic pure Rise Against. 4.5/5 <br />10. Behind closed doors; great riff over the top, cool song, 4/5 <br />11. Roadside; another experimental song, the girls vocals work well, the slowest song on the album, much like swing life away from the last album except way better, 4/5 <br />12.  The good left undone; love the backing vocals in this song, quite simply awesome, chorus beat change is interesting, 4.5/5 <br />13. Survive; the weakest song on the album, this shows how good this album really is, 3.5/5 <br />14. The boy's no good (bonus); fun and quick way to finish the album, quite odd but I enjoyed it, highlights the lighter side to Rise Against 3/5 <br /> <br />It;s their best album and I find it hard to skip a song.  Go and buy it if your into punk or hardcore or metal or even pop music.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I loved the story, I loved Tom Hank doing multiple roles and it waas in great condition.
0520215850|1.0|I AM FURIOUS THAT THEY MADE THIS BOOK \\"ABRIDGED\\" it is a fantastic novel that can only be appreciated in its fullness. the translator also uses names like Xuande and Kongming for charecters like Liu Bei and Zhuge Liand... which as a Dynasty Warriors fan was very confusing to me as the reader..The editor will not do a successfull job in sumerizing events either ....the Riverlands attack on Naman for example, is summed up in at least two sentences......if you really love the origonal, which most of you who do not already soon will....PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK YOU ARE JUST SHORTING CHEATING YOURSELF OUT OF A GREAT NOVEL...ITS LIKE USING CLIFFSNOTES FOR HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000B0QOJA|2.0|Dont Get Me wrong I love Coltrane i cant sleep unless im listening to him. Also the sound quality is very good except on the song one up one down the microphone or the recording shorts out atleast 20 times during the song. Now The positives AFRO BLUE is my favorite song he plays even though its mambo santamaria i give trane lots of credit for doing covers of songs most stubbern jazz players wouldnt do that also my favorite things isnt the best ive heard but its decent. so in closing theres only 4 songs one is great but the one up one down mix is all screwed up but i still can recomend this album rip trane the best
B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie is many times better than Superman Returns, and so is Superman II.  Superman I is highly enjoyable, even after 28 years.  It has everything.  It has a very good story line, good acting, romance, humor and lots of action.  But most of all, it has Christopher Reeve, the best Superman ever.  Others may try to imitate him, but he can never be replaced.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|This is the latest album from \\"the voice and guitar of Dire Straits\\". While Knopfler's style is different to that of Dire Straits, it's not completely detached. There are certainly some similarities (besides the obvious!). <br /> <br />The album's opener, \\"5.15a.m.\\", is a great start. It features a strong vocal with a gentle guitar accompaniment at the beginning, which soon gives way to bass guitar and percussion. Then comes a bit of piano - very effective I must say - and some harmonies, followed by lead guitar. It's a well-written song, and very pleasing to the ear. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Boom, Like That\\". This is mostly lead guitar and drums, with a fairly slow but solid rhythm. If you're a fan of Dire Straits, you'll like this - although it is distinctly lacking in variation. <br /> <br />Despite being rather too predictable, \\"Sucker Row\\" is moderately catchy. The chorus is better, but after that it's more of the same. Not a bad track, but not exactly groundbreaking. <br /> <br />\\"The Trawlerman's Song\\" is average at best. Not much to write home about really. It's another fairly predictable track, apart from a couple of nice chords at the end of the middle section, but then it goes back into the verse. I keep wanting this track to end so I can hear the rest of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Back to Tupelo\\" has an introduction that's like a slow version of the intro to \\"Sultans of Swing\\", albeit without the drums. It's a bit of a loose comparison, but that's what it felt like to me! There's very little going on here apart from the vocals, particularly for the first minute and a bit. Not very exciting. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Our Shangri-La\\", which is all very nice but suffers badly from some particularly dreary chords in the verse. The middle has some brief guitar work, but this is otherwise a very uninspired track. <br /> <br />Track 7, \\"Everybody Pays\\", starts out with the same chord as the previous track. Not a good start. The organ is particularly dodgy, and the vocals aren't great either. There are a few nice chords in the middle, but again, this is pretty bad. That's half the album done already! <br /> <br />Despite its use of the same chord through almost the entire track, \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" is much more catchy than most of what came before. It does begin to drag though, as there are an awful lot of verses. <br /> <br />Then it's \\"Whoop de doo\\", which feels a bit like \\"Fade to Black\\", but in a major key. Generally OK, but it becomes a bit of a plod once you get to know it. An average vocal melody, with mostly uninteresting intstrumentation. <br /> <br />Ah, now this is better! \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" is faster than the rest of the album, and it has a really catchy melody. The main theme is varied enough to escape relatively unscathed from the \\"lack of variation\\" comments I've made about other tracks. Good stuff. <br /> <br />\\"All that matters\\" feels very much like a lullaby. It's a gentle waltz with a simple but pleasing melody. Ironically it's probably this that has the freshest guitar solo on the whole album. The lyrics are very bland, though. <br /> <br />Track 12, \\"Stand up guy\\", is very much driven by the vocals. The instruments do little more than accompany Knopfler's singing. That's not to say they're bad - they do a good job, particularly when the piano comes in for the chorus. Because it's so focused on the lyrics, the lack of variation (again) is less of a problem here. A solid track and a rare gem on this album. <br /> <br />Simple but effective, \\"Donegan's Gone\\" is lacking in decent lyrics, but that's not really the point. It's just a straightforward toe-tapper that wouldn't be out of place in the repertoire of a band who plays in pubs at the weekend. Not much to it really. <br /> <br />With its haunting guitar riff, storytelling lyrics and long verses, \\"Don't crash the ambulance\\" is a bit out of place on this album. It's an odd number, but it's a very interesting song. <br /> <br />As you can probably tell, this is an album that's very difficult to sum up in a few words! Too many of the tracks are seriously lacking in depth, but there are still a handful of tracks that make this worth a listen.
B000E41MRC|4.0|A testimony of 'not so ancient' times. The darkest time of Germany. If you carefully watch this movie you will understand how the Nazis used (beautiful) images to promote their message. Looks like to me that Hitler decided to promote himself as an actor to serve his cause.  <br />Technically a wonderful transfer, pictures are of a very good quality, specially if you consider time that passed. <br />Sound could've been better but years are certainly for something in the flaws. <br />A must see.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|this movie is my favorite to say the least,it is loaded with action. <br />from the beginning to end you will see v as a terrorist <br />but for some reason you are on his side. <br />he finally narrows down to the last day,the fifth of november. <br />all of you reading this review,buy the movie now you wont want to miss it.

B000EULJLU|3.0|A few decent tracks    but just a few; and just decent. I can't help but think that this \\"hidden message\\" is going to turn out to be: <br /> <br />APRIL FOOLS! THE REAL ALBUM WILL BE OUT DECEMBER 21 2012!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I've known about the release of this album since summer of 2005 and couldn't wait to hear it. When I first heard of the album, the name in particular, I thought \\"Disturbed\\" and when I saw the art work I admit I was dissapointed but when I heard their first single \\"Vicarious\\" I got hooked. The album is great but still doesn't hold a candle to \\"Aenima\\". the album's best tracks are \\"10,000 Days(Wings Pt.2)\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".
0553801503|1.0|You may ask why I gave this book only 1 star. While I can understand why some people might think it's worth more, for me the good moments within this book were too few and far between. A number of times I felt I should walk away from the book, so I cannot in good conscience give more than 1 star when it was such a struggle to complete.    The fact is that I was in love with this series, otherwise I would never have completed the book. If this were a stand alone book from Mr Martin I would have struggled through a few chapters, hoping and praying it would get better, but would finally have accepted it wasn't worth the read. Because it was part of his immaculate Fire & Ice series I forced myself to go on, like someone in denial a relationship is over, and it wasn't till the very end realization dawned on me that now it's time to move on. Looking back it seems the relationship was well and truly over 5 years ago, I just couldn't see that till now.    Mr Martin wooed me with his first three books, all were out in quick succession and it really was a roller coaster ride. Then there was the fourth book, A Feast for Crows. This book took five years to write, more time than the first three put together. I don't really believe Mr Martin was pushed for time, or under too much pressure from the publisher or the fans. He definitely has the ability to write wonderfully, no one denies that, so why did this book take so long? And why did he release something so far beneath his usual high quality? I believe it's because he's bored with the series. He created a monster and now he doesn't know how to rein it in. If you read his web site (I do often) you'll see that he's involved in all manner of projects that are not part of the Fire & Ice series. I think this shows that Mr Martin wants to work on other things, and that perhaps he's in denial himself about his relationship with the series. If he were truly excited about working on this series, like he was at the start, then you'd have to tear him away from it and we'd be seeing a new book every year. As it is I think it will be many years before the Fire & Ice series is completed, if at all.    I know I haven't talked much about this book. To be honest it's not really worth wasting time discussing the specifics of the book, simply because it's so bad. If you prefer to remain in denial then by all means struggle on through it, and whatever others Mr Martin may write in the series. For me life's too short and there are so many other wonderful books out there.
B00005CDNK|5.0|I recently purchased all the limited edition remasters - (HINT: buy them now from sellers - I guess they are getting rare)... \\"THE VISITORS\\" is their last and finest release.  It is mature and developed - it is an \\"album\\" - not a release with some great singles (as most of their catalog is).  This remaster has the brilliant \\"Day Before You Came\\" - perhaps their most sophisticated single.  ABBA are often overlooked in the history of music because of their initial pop hits; these were highly talented writers, musicians, lyricists and vocalists.  Amazon Sellers are offerring these at such affordable prices it is nonsense to not pick up THE VISITORS and some of the other later releases ......  pure pop doesn't get much better than this - and most likely never will!
0393327655|4.0|By way of disclosure, I am an evangelical Christian, but I still found much of value in this book. <br /> <br />I gave this book four stars because Harris raises several good points with a style of writing that engages readers even when they disagree with him.  Religious nuts are no longer harmless eccentrics to be patronized like flat earthers.  Reason ought to play more of a role in how we live our lives and treat other people.  Refusing to admit the harm done by religion is simply dishonest.  Even so, I couldn't give this book five stars.   <br /> <br />You see, in his own way, Harris is a true believer and he does the same thing that Ann Coulter does in her books.  Coulter blames liberals for our problems and Harris blames believers.  Instead of playing the blame game, we ought to be working on the problems themselves.
0767903862|4.0|Although Bill Bryson is fond of detailing the myriad ways the Australian wild can maim or kill, the overall effect of his excellent travelogue is to increase his readers' affection for the country and its people. This book is well-written, loaded with interesting facts, and often incredibly funny. <br /> <br />While the author's travels include the major coastal cities, much of his time is spent crisscrossing the vast, empty tracts of land that make up most of the continent. He visits remote outback settlements and obscure museums rarely frequented by other tourists. As interesting as Sydney is, small towns such as White Cliffs, where the dwellings are dug into the hills, are Australia's true gems.  <br /> <br />Among the most rewarding aspects of the book is the rich historical context provided by Bryson. Australia's unique and colorful past includes its days as a penal colony, a veritable plague of rabbits, and more than a few ill-fated exploring expeditions. When the narrator visits Canberra he not only describes his experiences in the modern metropolis, but also how and why the nation's capital ended up, literally, in the middle of nowhere. The additional information sheds a great deal of light on modern day Australia. <br /> <br />In a Sunburned Country is a very enjoyable read regardless of whether or not you plan to visit the land down under. While it won't replace a guide from Fodor's or Lonely Planet, it is immensely more entertaining and leaves you far better acquainted with this fascinating place.
B000058DFO|3.0|when I ordered the CD I was hoping to recapture the sound of the 70's as I recalled them.  As it turns out, this CD didn't do that at all.
0563486430|3.0|While on a domestic visit home to let Rose see Jackie and Mickey, the Doctor and Rose see a statue of Rose as the goddess Fortuna in the British museum. To avoid at time paradox, they know their next stop should be ancient Rome so that Rose's modelling career can happen. Of course, it is not as simple as that. Immediately upon arrival, they are drawn into a missing person's investigation as they discover that the statue's maker's models are disappearing right and left. Well, actually, they are not disappearing, they are being immortalized, in stone, much like what happened to the late and unlamented President Borusa in the Five Doctors. The Doctor and Rose naturally want to set the people free, but before they can get far, Rose herself becomes a statue. The Doctor finds a way to free her, only to become a victim himself. As things get progressively worse, it is up to Rose Tyler to save the world, again.  <br />Though this is in no way as much fun as a Ninth Doctor adventure, it is still a good story with an almost fairy tale like quality. The ending is somewhat Harry Potterish, but that is not a flaw, merely ironic since this run of the Doctor has featured both Barty Crouch Sr. and Jr and Moaning Myrtle.
B000060MMI|5.0|My review comes with certain disdain for punk music and in my cd collection the only \\"punk\\" I own is Dead Kennedy's. My girlfriend bought this cd one day And it ripped my skull open. My favorite type of music is folk and/or bluegrass and this cd, in my humble opinion, is a cross between them two generes mixed with a dash of tasteful punk rock fury.The lyrics are as excellent as the music so pseudo-folk fans like myself can find gold here with this cd.....its a surefire CLASSIC! I seen them live in columbus recently and they brought the city down!!

B0000549B0|5.0|Just saw the movie which I remember seing as a little girl(A long time ago).I can only say it is a TIMELESS classic.You, begin to believe in Harvey!The commentary from J.Stewart was good too.Also learning that the story was penned to relieve a neighbour's sad loss of her son in WWII war was quite touching. The acting was faultless from Elwood P Dowd to his lovable sister and the \\"Nut house \\" doctor who pleads to have <br />Harvey for himself. It is fantasy whith astute human's behaviour observed. <br />As Mr Stewart remakes \\"I tried smart now I prefer nice\\".The movie brings to mind who is sane and who should be locked up. <br />Millie
B000006OBQ|3.0|The music tracks are great; enjoyed by three generations.  The lounge act narrative in the middle of the CD cannot be over fast enough.  Burned copies of this CD and deleted the narratives - much better.  Buy the CD for the live performance 'feel.'
B000F3TBIO|5.0|i love everything mike patton, and i still think this one's great. the song with massive attack is awesome, and the one with norah jones surprised me, she's no sweet little girl anymore! in that song she has that totally evil/sexy thing going on... i love peeping tom, and i can't wait for the next lovage album to come out!
B000EMGJM2|4.0|I'm such a Van Hunt fan.  He is a musical innovator, unafraid to make music that does not sound like typical R&B.  He is an extraordinary songwriter (did you know he wrote Dionne Farris' \\"Penny with a hole in it\\" from that classic \\"Love Jones sdtk.?)  Really he's a poet who plays a mean guitar.  Shame this guy doesn't get the airplay he deserves, and that I have yet to see a video from this album on TV- you gotta go to Yahoo music to see a couple videos and interviews w/ this guy.  Helped produce a lot of Rahsaan Patterson's stuff, another Godsend of a voice...  Van's often compared to Prince.  It could be worse...  This album is straight rock in a couple spots, but mostly guitar heavy smooth r&b and funk.  One of those albums any music lover could dig.  Van even covers Iggy Pop's \\"no sense of crime,\\" showing his versatility.  It's not quite neo-soul, not quite funk, but it is too good for one category.  (\\"the night is young\\" is easily his least interesting song between the two of his albums and could've been left off-)Only two skippable songs- \\"daredevil\\" & \\"the night is young,\\" and \\"daredevil\\" isn't bad at all...get it and enjoy!
B00005AQGH|5.0|2pac's Greatest albums I would say are all the non posthumous releases which are <br />2pacalypse Now <br />Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. <br />Thug Life Volume 1 <br />Me Against The World <br />All Eyez On Me <br />And This album <br /> <br />They did their best after the legendary Tupac Shakur died but nothing compares to the treasure he released before he died. <br /> <br />This is 2pac's Second Death Row release with three singles Hail Mary, Toss It Up and To Live & Die In L.A. <br /> <br />This is definitely 2pac at his best and is known as his most violent album with some of the political Pac Like heard in his first two releases. <br /> <br />This is an absolute classic and a must buy for any gangsta rap fan. My Ratings are <br /> <br />1. Bomb First 10/10 A Good song, one of the dark, violent songs on this album, Great start to the album <br />2. Hail Mary 10/10 A hit, not overrated, another dark song great for the album with incredible beats <br />3. Toss It Up 10/10 Another hit single not a dark song but his voice is great especially in the second verse <br />4. To Live & Die In L.A. 10/10 Another hit, a bit like California Love where he talks about L.A. Not at all overrated <br />5. Blasphemy 10/10 top song, another dark song great for this album, Tupac's voice is great in this one <br />6. Life Of An Outlaw 10/10 The Outlawz are featured on this one and they are not that great but the beats are incredible <br />7.

B000053VAZ|1.0|Those who describe this story as \\"cute\\" and Joon as \\"quirky\\" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show had it all, if only the network had given it a chance.  There was adventure, drama, comedy, a great plot, and and excellent cast of likable characters.  It was a very unique mix of the sci-fi and western genres, as well as a bit of an Asian flair, since in this version of the future, China was one of the major superpowers to survive.  It all made for a great story of outlaws in space, making their way in a postwar world. <br /> <br />In summary, the acting and writing on this series was stellar, the plot and character development was excellent, and it will leave you wanting more.  The only bad thing about it was that it was so short! <br />
B000002NFM|5.0|as soon as the first notes start on the first track, i can't help but start moving. from beginning to end, this albumn gets me amped up and ready to take on the world. this is definative prodigy and a must have for every music lover. it is a benchmark in electronic music that still feels as fresh as when it came out a decade ago.
B000FP2Z0S|3.0|This is a LONG review, but if you want an honest take on \\" Sufferer And The Witness \\", then read on... <br /> <br />I first started listening to Rise Against when they released their highly acclaimed \\" Siren Song Of The Counter Culture \\", loved by music fans of all genres. This album was great because it offered so much variety within its catchy tunes. All the songs were good, except \\" State Of The Union \\" and \\" Swing Life Away \\". Of all the cd's I own, Siren Song is near the top of the list of my favorites. <br /> <br />When this album came out mere days ago, I came here to read the reviews. There were only 7 on the day of the release, but each were perfect 5-star reviews praising Rise Against for another great album. I listened to some song clips and it sounded ok, so I went into the album with low expectations hoping they wound be risen. But after listening to \\" Suffer And The Witness \\" full through, I cant help but say I am disappointed. <br /> <br />The problem that plagues this album is the overall lack of polish that Siren Song had. Now in reality, each band always changes their sound every release to keep their music fresh. I can understand that fans either like the new change or not. Even without that notion though, \\" Sufferer And The Witness \\" is an average record at best. <br /> <br />The first thing I noticed when I popped the cd into my car to listen to the opener of the album, \\" Chamber The Cartridge \\" was the change in vocals. Tim sounds alot less raspy then he did in previous releases, but the real wonder is what Chris Lord-Alge (the producer) was thinking when it came to hearing the sounds of Joe and Chris (the backup vocalists of the band). They almost sound like robots in this album - at least clearly in the chorus of \\" Chamber The Cartridge \\". <br /> <br />Following \\" Chamber The Cartridge\\" are some of the best tracks on the cd in \\" Injection \\" and \\" Ready To Fall \\". Both of these songs ooze with polish and feel like they couldve been on \\" SirenSong Of The Counter Culture \\". \\" Bricks \\" is classic Rise Against, which makes for a fast track overflowing with energy and continues the pace set forth at the beginning of the cd. But as the album progresses on, however, flaws start to be exposed. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with this album is that the tracks start to become to generic. \\" Prayer And The Refugee \\" and \\" Drones \\" are two prime examples of this opinion. Both songs have great choruses and verses (Prayer's haunting guitars are excellent), but arent long enough. The chorus of \\" Drones \\" is sang only once at the end of the song and is no different from the choruses earlier in the song - the same with \\" Prayer \\". If only they threw in some harmonies at the end or something, wouldve made these tracks phenomenal. They arent bad cuts, but they feel like they are missing something. \\" The Approaching Curve \\" is a little too experimental to enjoy. <br /> <br />Of the last four tracks on the cd, \\" Roadside \\" is the only one worth mentioning. The female vocals in this song work great, and the whole feel is relaxed and mysterious. This is one of the better slow songs that Rise Against has produced during their tenure in the scene. <br /> <br />All in all, \\" The Sufferer And The Witness \\" isnt a bad album, but its just so average. All the greatness that was produced in \\" Siren Song Of The Counter Culture \\" seemed to be lost in the tradition. Go listen to \\" Tip The Scales \\", \\" Paper Wings \\", and \\" Rumors Of My Demise \\" and then listen to this album. Nothing is varied like those songs. I highly reccomend sampling some tracks from this album to see if you like it. You are always better safe then sorry. If I could I would give it 2.5 stars. <br /> <br />Other Notes: <br /> <br />- As evident from the cover of this album, there is a PA sticker on it. There are only 4 curse words on the cd, all being F words on the last cut, \\" Survive \\". Other then that, there is no cursing on the album. <br /> <br />- The insert ofthe cd contains the lyrics and a few pictures of the band playing live. The lyrics are written in an artsy version of cursive, so some parts are difficult to read. To be honest, you really arent missing much if you dont get the insert, so buying the album online via a digital distribution service like iTunes is not that bad of an option to consider. <br /> <br />- If you buy the album at Best Buy, you get a ticket inside the jewel case that lets you download a live version of \\" Life Less Frightening \\" online. If you get the album at Target, you can get a live version of \\" Paper Wings \\" as well as a bonus track entitled \\" The Boy's No Good \\". <br /> <br />I hope you enjoyed my review, and thanks for reading. <br />
B000002OOY|5.0|The themes and emotions of Jurassic Park are felt when you listen to this soundtrack. I love Theme from Jurassic Park and Journey to the Island. This is a great soundtrack. It pulls together several main themes that you hear and know that you are listening to Jurassic Park. You can feel the adventure of the movie come out through the music of this soundtrack. It is a must-have for music and movie fans alike.
B0007RQKXC|5.0|Everyone has seen Akira Kurosawa's classic film \\"Rashomon\\" ripped off (or homaged, if you prefer) on countless television shows from \\"All in the Family\\" to \\"The X-Files,\\" not to mention in film, most notably \\"Courage Under Fire\\" in recent years.  Consequently, seeing the original at this late date is certainly a distorted endeavor, but it is decidedly worth the effort to appreciate a film that has become a cultural touchstone.  In a temple during a rainstorm, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) mutters that he does not understand what has happened.  The story he tells to a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) is of a \\"rape\\" and a \\"murder.\\"  The woodcutter testified at the trial of the thief Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune), at which the woman who was raped, Masako (Machiko Kyo), and her husband who was murdered, Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) all testify as well (the dead husband through a Medium played by Fumiko Honma).  All four of the stories are different, so the question of the moment is \\"Which one is true?\\"<br /><br />There are those who say this film is about the ambiguity of truth, arguing that what really happened is never depicted in the film. I do not buy this interpretation at all. At the end we do indeed get the \\"truth,\\" which is why a second viewing of the film is so worthwhile, for it allows us to reinterpret each of the narrative to reach an understanding of why each person distorts their telling of the tale. Their distortions, omissions and lies are not random, but strategic given each what has happened to each of these individuals.  In see what each lies about, we are able to uncover their motives and why the story they tell might serve them better than the truth.  This is something we can better understand, not to mention better appreciate, the second, third or how ever many times around it takes.<br /><br />Another reason why it is important to watch \\"Rashomon\\" more than once is to appreciate the way each of the narratives in the film is told in a different way cinematically.  One of the times you watch the film again pay attention to how the composition of the shots, the music in the background, and the editing technique are all unique to that particular version of what happened in the woods.  So each time we get a \\"new\\" version of the story, the changes are not only in terms of the substance but also of the style as well.<br /><br />The historical note that this film \\"introduced\\" Japanese cinema to the Western World is an interesting footnote. But this is a psychological drama that transcends culture, which is to say that the film is not as inherently \\"Japanese\\" as other Kurosawa efforts.  I make this comment cognizant of the stilted American adaptation of the tale, \\"The Outrage,\\" which was set, like most adaptations of Kurosawa, in the old West.  The characters in \\"Rashomon\\" are speaking Japanese, but their actions and the lies they tie about their actions, prove them to be utterly human.old in a different way cinematically.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing, and I love the music. I listen to it all the time. What happens in the movie is portrayed very well in the music played along side it. Pirates of the Caribbean is a great movie with a great soundtrack. I recommend it for any POTC fan.
B00005B58Y|5.0|MILESTONES was both the musical and chronological bridge between trumpeter Miles Davis' great mid-fifties quintet (John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums), with its postbop sensibilities and emphasis on fresh interpretations of standard material, and the more personalized and transcendent vision Davis would realize so brilliantly on his next album, KIND OF BLUE. By augmenting the quintet with Cannonball Adderley's matchless alto saxophone chops, Miles added tonal variety to a signature sound which, for all its beauty, had started to grow a bit predictable; and by redirecting his own compositional bent from harmonic to modal centers he literally wrote an entire new chapter in jazz history. All of this is excitingly evident on this crucial 1958 recording.     Taking numbers by Thelonious Monk (\\"Straight No Chaser\\"), Jackie McLean (\\"Dr. Jekyll\\") and John Lewis (\\"Two Bass Hit\\") on rides which even the composers themselves could never have envisioned, Davis and Company here set a new standard for small group improvisation. If anyone still had any doubts, MILESTONES certainly announced that the bebop era was over. Further leavening the proceedings, a hornless workout on \\"Billy Boy\\" allows Davis' excellent rhythm section (often obscured by the playing and reputations of this legendary front line) to sing and shine on its own while the leader takes a breather. But it's the two original compositions herein - \\"Sid's Ahead\\" and even more so the title track - which really point the way forward. The former is an epic-length jam balancing control and freedom in a manner almost unprecedented, with improvisational statements of consummate logic effectively becoming the structure of the piece over its thirteen minutes and change. \\"Milestones\\" itself is a sort of first stab at KIND OF BLUE, and could easily have fit on that album were it a bit lengthier - as it would subsequently become in concert. Miles' lightheartedly reflective melody is now a classic, and the permutations through which he and his band take it proclaim the advent of a powerful new approach to the genre. Great stuff, and a definite must-have for any serious jazz enthusiast!
B00006DEFA|5.0|It is amazing to see the completed film. I have seen the released version so many times and the re-inserted bits of story make it so much more complete and coherent. And, nothing beats the soundtrack!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Fans of Ridley Scott's superbly cast theatrical Crusade epic, \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" will be even more pleased with the arrival of an extended four disc \\"Director's Cut\\" from Fox.  Not only are we introduced to additional scenes but additional characters in this expanded and improved DVD version.  As a result, roles are fleshed out, plot points are better developed and the entire film flows more smoothly.  Regarding  the very extended extra features, the fact that \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was made at all is a tribute to the many talented people we meet as part of the most extensive \\"making of\\" footage I've yet seen included with a DVD release of a major studio offering.  As to the political and historical controversy surrounding \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" I can only say watch this expanded version and decide for yourself, \\"Are you not entertained?\\"
0920668364|5.0|I was first introuduced to this story by my Aunt. She read it to me and my baby cousin a few times. Even as a child I was in love with this story. Yes, at that age it did make me a little sad, but for what it was worth, I think it made me feel good too.<br /><br />Some may pass this book by saying that it's \\"creepy\\". I don't like to just push away other's opinions, but I find it hard to see how this book is \\"creepy\\" or \\"bizzare\\". One must realize(at least this is how I percieved it to be)that his mother coming back is all in the son's mind. She's not truly there, she's with him in his dreams and memories. I felt that this was trying to show that the love of a mother can have a lasting impression. Also when he's rocking his mother, I found nothing \\"creepy\\" about this. It was(to me) a continuation of the circle started by his mother. One cares for the other who isn't able to with love and compassion. Then when the son is old enough, he does the same for his dying mother.<br /><br />Perhaps these themes aren't what will be processed by your child. But if you live in an open, honest, and communicating household I feel most children(as I did when I was first read this) will understand the book for the most part. But the themes themselves are what makes this book such a pleasure to read! It's not only for children but I feel it's as much for adults. It's one of those stories that's \\"timeless\\". It's a simple beauty...don't cheat yourself out of it!<br /><br />If anything, buy it for yourself!

B0002OERI0|3.0|Yes, we all love Green Day and their American Idiot stuff, but don't you think it's time to give it a rest now and give that spot on the radio station to a band that deserves it, instead of playing Boulevard of Broken Dreams AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN?  I mean c'mon people.  American Idiot 2004.  It is now 2006.  American Idiot has done it's job, and made us all warm and fuzzy inside for Green Day, but if I hear Boulevard of Broken Dreams again, I'm going to barf.  It just goes to show you, it's not good when you overdo it.  Even Green Day can get old.  I know I'm not the only one out there that wants to hear something else on the radio.
B00005JLK1|2.0|A man approaches a salvage team to tow an old Italian cruise ship with a jinxed past.<br /><br />The best part of this movie was the opening scene on the cruise ship where the wealthy voyagers were slaughtered.  I'm not sure if I'd say it was believable, but it was certainly a sweet effect.<br /><br />Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne are in the movie - definite plus!!  Some of the ghosts were kind of cool, including the little girl and the sexy young singer.<br /><br />The movie does have some decent scenes, but overall it was lacking the uneasy or eerie feeling a haunted place would have.  This is a MUST for any ghost story.  Without it, everything is just bland.<br /><br />Plus the ending lacked imagination....or rather they tried to throw in a twist, but it just wasn't an interesting one. There was relatively little to no foreshadowing about the man who approached the team, so when the time came about for the twist  I was left with a disappointed feeling of,  \\"oh. they're going to end it that way.\\"
0385474547|5.0|Although I had to read \\"Things Fall Apart\\" by Chinua Achebe, I found it nothing but enjoyable.  This book consists of Okonkwo, a man who has made his living on his own and has become one of the major leaders of his tribe, as he struggles to understand the white mens' motives for coming to the tribes.  The story consists of the tribes of lower Nigeria couping with what happens when the white missonaries enter their land.  The story was engrossing in points, in part, because of the rich the culture the tribes bring to the book.  The book is filled with numerous fables, and facts from the tribes of lower Nigeria.  I enjoyed the journey of Okonkwo, and the ending causes me to think and ponder his questions.

B000FIHJLK|1.0|Okay this is now the THIRD live Rainbow/Dio album and im extrememly unimpressed having purchased 1976 live album  <br />'On Stage' with a setlist of: <br /> <br />Kill The King <br />Man On The Silver Mountain <br />Catch The Rainbow <br />Mistreated - which isn't even a Rainbow track <br />Sixteeth Century Greensleeves <br />Still I'm Sad <br /> <br />and although the tracks are fairly lengthy in stature which seems to be a trait of Blackmore with stunning guitar performances. This album would definately be reccomended if... <br /> <br />I hadn't discovered the 1990 release 'Live In Germany 1976' and although this DOUBLE-DISC isn't as polished as the performance of 'On Stage' it is definately worth the money with a track list of: <br /> <br />Kill The King <br />Mistreated <br />Sixteenth Century Greensleeves <br />Catch The Rainbow <br />Man On The Silver Mountain <br />Stargazer <br />Still I'm Sad <br />Do Your Close Your Eyes <br /> <br />with two extra tracks one of them being the mammoth of an epic that is STARGAZER this one definately is more worth of purchase to a fan looking for some live rainbow or maybe if youre a die-hard/collector you'd purchase both <br /> <br />However this 2006 release is just a complete hound for money the way i see it, it offers nothing new to collector's except for maybe the inclusion of 'Long Live Rock 'N' Roll' a live track which can be found on Rainbow's 'Finyl Vinyl' LP. <br /> <br />I can't see why Blackmore doesn't release material from the latter or even first tour offering fans and collector's some fresh live material to enjoy instead of this plain repeat of an offer... <br /> <br />My advice is if you own On Stage and are looking for another get 'Live In Germany 1976' but if youre looking for a first live Rainbow CD, This seems like a blazing performance with a set slightly better than that of On Stage.
B0000A14WB|5.0|Outstanding, but I wish they put more on the center channel, why have 5.1 if you are too lazy to mix for the center channel.  Wish the producer had mixed the tracks he had and spread it across to include the center channel. Now I have to upgrade my mains to match my 7 driver quad amp center channel.

B0001D0FTW|3.0|What first strikes me about this album is that edguy is trying waaay too hard to be a classic metal band.  Honestly it's out of control here and i find it almost unlistenable.  Not because its bad, but because its incredibly generic and other bands do it much better.  This album is a wannabe operation mindcrime except much less enjoyable. The lead singer (i'm not going to waste my time seeing who it is) tries ridiculously hard to be dickinson or tate. I feel like i've wasted money hearing something that sounds like everything on the classic rock station my mom listens to.  In contrast to such gleaming reviews, nothing special here folks.  Look elsewhere for your metal.
1577314808|1.0|I agree with Time Magazine.  The theory of staying in the Now is very good, but I believe the author was trying to hard to \\"write a book\\", which should have stayed an essay.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Great album.  Near perfect blend of metal and opera/symphony/whatever.  Actually bought this album thanks to hearing Ghost Love Score on YTMND...ha!  One gripe:  Musicianship is a bit simplified with the guitars and I don't like the tone of the bass.  Reminds me of Meshuggah's Chaosphere.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I have their first CD and love it.  As soon as I heard they had a new one I bought it and I can't stop listening to it.  All the songs on it kick a**.

B000003FD9|5.0|I don't know much about who's who in music. Actually, I don't know much about music. So when I decided I wanted some cello, I naturally listened to samplings by Yoyoma. Coming across my cheap computer speakers, the music was naturally flat. Then I read a review saying how Janos Starker's cd was much better. When I listened to this cd over my cheap speakers, I was amazed at the vibrance. I bought this cd and have been pleased at how much emotion comes through. It is exactly the music I had wanted when I decided I wanted cello music.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"I'm gonna tell you about love. Let's forget your life. Forget your problems. The adiministration, bills and loans. Come with me!\\"      This is the first line of the 4th track \\"Future Lovers\\", and for me, this line explains the whole concept of \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\", the first non-stop dance album from the queen of pop, Madonna.      I was reading many reviews about this album, and I notice that most people who gives this album a low rate, complains about the lyrics. If you understand the concept of this album, and about what Madonna was trying to create, then, the lyrics are not problem at all. I mean, as you can see, this album is a 70's disco oriented pop-dance album. So it's natural for it to have light and mild lyrics. Easily saying, who wants to dance a song with depressing, heavy and deep lyrics?. Well, maybe some people do, but not me.      \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" is all about having fun. The lyrics are light, and most of the songs are catchy as hell. It's been a long time since I bought this album, and I can say to you that THIS ALBUM IS JUST ADDICTIVE.      Sorry about my english (I'm not an english native speaker). But if I could define this album with one word, this word would definitely be \\"Charming\\".      I can't wait to see her \\"Confessions Tour\\" here in Japan. It was one of my dreams seeing her on concert, and finally, it will come true.
B000063IQP|3.0|The Tangs really found direction on this, their third release from way back in 1973.  This was the first release featuring the Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, Peter Baumann line-up that quickly established them as out-there pioneers of experimental space-rock.  Listeners familiar with their early Virgin label releases \\"Phaedra\\" and \\"Rubycon\\" will find \\"Atem\\" to be a worthy companion to both those widely-acknowledged classics and an interesting taste of a new genre just taking its first baby steps after some nasty pratfalls on their earlier releases (\\"Electronic Meditation\\"-unlistenable, and \\"Zeit\\", not much better).<br /><br />\\"Atem\\" (\\"breathless\\" in German) was the first band effort to really codify the cosmic atmospherics that the Tangs quickly perfected on their other 1970's classic releases, most particularly the previously cited \\"Rubycon\\" and \\"Phaedra\\".  Let's be clear about this: you will never sing along to \\"Atem\\" as you drive to work; you will never put it in the CD changer for you and your friends to nibble cheese and slurp Zinfandel to.  This is stark Teutonic synthesizer moodiness at its most austere and ponderous level. This is not music you warm to; it's unique in the chilly soundscapes their then-exotic analog synthesizers created.  Unlike their synth predecessors like Dick Hyman, Wendy Carlos, Tomita, or Keith Emerson, the Tangs were indifferent to the synthesizers' ability to reinterpret previous musical tropes in a zippy, novel 1960's sort of way.  Froese, Franke & Baumann chose instead to take a sharp left turn and instead create a whole new stylistic vocabulary of electronic composition which they owned more or less exclusively for a short while.  Contemporaries like Klaus Schulze (a member of the Tangs on their first release) also drew from the same well his old band initially drilled, and quite effectively too (I recommend Schulze's 1977 release \\"Mirage\\" very highly), but the Tangs definitely should be your first stop in experiencing this unique stew of Wagnerian drama and ethereal soundscapes.<br /><br />If you're new to this genre and interested I would recommend you start with \\"Rubycon,\\" Tangerine Dream's fifth release, issued to great acclaim in 1975, and to my ears still their pinnacle of composition and performance.  If this impresses you, then go back & pick up \\"Phaedra\\", then \\"Atem\\".  Or possibly skip \\"Atem\\" altogether in favor of their first live album, the hypnotic \\"Ricochet,\\" a fascinating taste of the mid-70's \\"scene,\\" where edgy artists like the Tangs could pull off shows premiering all previously unrecorded material to reverential audiences on the continent basking in awe (or possibly just stoned deference) to the mysterious prog-rock kaliedoscope being sonically unfurled.<br /><br />Germany was really the birthplace of this electronic rock genre and during the '70's had an outrageously vibrant progressive rock scene, boasting not only the Tangs but other luminaries such as Ash Ra Temple, Eloy, Nine Days Wonder, Kraan,  Kraftwerk, Trimvirat, Cluster, Tritonus and many others who burned not quite so incandescently during this brief fruiting of adventurous rockers who have left us such a rich vein of pioneering music to rediscover and appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Atem\\", while not a top-drawer example of what the German scene could produce at that time still stands up as an early obelisk on the road toward the ruins of the shining progressive city erected in the 1970's and since mostly abandoned.

0767802470|5.0|For years, this has been my favorite movie of all time.  Das Boot is a triumph of technological innovation in film making, the type of which is being slowly replaced by cheap CGI wizardry.  But its the acting in this film, particularly from Jurgen Prochnow as the Captain, that forces us to accept the crew as fellow human beings and sets the movie apart.  Wolfgang Petersen has effectively combined these two main elements to create a screen experience you will never forget.     Those who have criticized this film have done so largely from two aspects:  that German servicemen of WW 2 should not be viewed sympathetically, and that the film was \\"boring\\".    The first argument is common in this country, where war movies are made to make it easy to hate the bad guy, and to affirm the \\"glory\\" of war.  Das Boot makes a complete end-run around this premise, and we get to see German sailors as neither \\"good\\" nor \\"bad\\", but HUMAN.  As a former sea going Naval Officer, I can tell you that the German sailors depicted in Das Boot mirror the exact same traits of those in our own Navy...crude, fun loving, innovative yet immature at times, and completely reliable and loyal when you need them the most.  The German sailors we see are young, conscripted recruits who never had the option to speak out against the politics that sent them to their deaths.    Those that think Das Boot moves to slow have most assuredly never spend time on a war ship underway.  Naval engagements in ANY era were a combination of long tedious weeks of boredom broken up by stark moments of sheer terror.  When we see U-96's crew sail for weeks before sighting a single ship, we get a realistic sense of the frustration and boredom that are part of life at sea.  But for those that prefer their action more fast paced, you can watch the absurd \\"U-571\\". In this farce of a Hollywood flick, you can be dazzled by nonstop explosions, cookie cutter bad guys, and fake, flag waving propaganda.     If you want patriotic, idiotic escapism, then Das Boot is not for you.  If you want to be moved by the human experience of war, then its the only one to watch.
B00005JNRY|1.0|I'm afraid to say that I simply hated this movie.   It was boring, slow, and the story sucks.   Pixar has really been failing recently, including Finding Nemo, Incredibles, and then this.   If anybody wants to see a good animated movie, go see Over The Hedge.   I give that 5 stars, as it is the best animated movie I've ever seen.
B00005B9UZ|1.0|Another product of Hollywood's \\"Karaoke Culture\\".  In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in \\"U-571\\" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of \\"Das Boot\\".  But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Be warned, this is a western, very real in the production design, make-up etc. <br /> <br />This is a slow movie, one of the slowest movie in the world. <br /> <br />It's almost 160 min and the story fits easily in 90 min. <br /> <br />But this is not about story, it's about feeling, style, music, romance, characters. <br /> <br />Great dvd, sound and extras. <br /> <br />If you like good Bad and Ugly (leone's best) and are not sure if Once upon a time in the west is worth our ten bucks, don't think twice, purchase this dvd now. I did it and have no regrets. <br /> <br />JPD

B00005ASGG|5.0|This film, along with They Were Expendable, are my favorite Ford films.  This is a film that you have to watch at least twice before you realise you're watching a masterpiece.  Contrary to most Ford westerns, it was shot on a soundstage as opposed to Momument Valley, and in stark black and white.  An overall melancholy and sadness permeates the film, and the mood settles over you like you're saying goodbye to an old friend.  It deals with many things:  the dying of the Old West, friendship, and the \\"legends\\" that countries put forth for the masses, but which are rarely true.  The famous \\"when the legend becomes fact, print the legend\\" line comes from this film.  When it's uttered by the newspaper editor (played wonderfully by Carleton Young), it makes you weep, especially when you find out who really shot Liberty Valance. This is Ford's last masterpiece.  It fits in with the phrase \\"old man's cinema\\".  It's slow, not flashy, melancholy, and filled with an old man's wisdom.  It's not very sentimental (which most Ford films are), and the film is so much better for it.  Ford completed only 3 more features after this, the hilarious and boisterous  Donovan's Reef, the slow, noble, but ultimately unsatisfying Cheyenne Autumn (his final western), and the very underrated Seven Women (which some have considered a masterpiece).  This is quinessential Ford.  A wonderful film.
B0002858YS|5.0|...current band.  I know they have a similar sound to a couple 80's New Wave band, but if I hated every band that sounded like somone else, I'd only be left with the Beatles. <br /> <br />Anyway...  suffice to say that my wife complains because I listen to this too much.  Out of about 600 albums we own, it's easily in my top 30 or 40.
0060751967|4.0|Another fun take on the vampire life - but they should have picked another title.  It implies that someone is actively trying to marry a rich vampire - when all the heroine wants to do is get on with what's left of her life after being dumped into witness protection...
B000002KB8|5.0|This eponymous classic debut Black Sabbath demonstrate how you could revolutionize the entire music movement without having long periods of time recording & mastering. This album was made with just 600 Uk pounds (~US$900)and only 8 hrs. of recording . The tracklist is stellar being the first track of the album (Black Sabbath) the most popular and also the one that move beyond the limits of heaviness compared by its peers(Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple, Uriah Heep,Blue Cheer) creating heavy metal.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|Because I enjoyed the movie, I bought this CD right away.  Despite what the other reviewers say on this page, in my humble opinion, the Main Titles (Track 1) is really why you would buy this CD, because it is an inspiring and glorious resurrection of the original Williams Superman theme.  The rest of the soundtrack is \\"incidental music\\" which doesn't mean much outside the film.  However, the price of the CD (even if just for 1 track) is justified because of the \\"enhanced content\\", which if you pop into a Mac or PC, is a short DVD showing, among the usual other throwaway rubbish, an extremely well-edited and well-made \\"making of\\" featurette of the entire live taping session of the main theme, attended by Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh.  It was fun watching the real musicians' expressions while they vigorously play the score.  That's worth the price of this CD.
B000002KDO|5.0|If the debut album & Paranoid were heavy this one is heavier. Master of Reality demonstrates why Black Sabbath aren't only the inventors are the most influential band in the heavy metal. From the ode of marijuana of \\"Sweet Leaf\\", the futuristic blast of \\"Into the Void\\" to the anti-Satanic stance on \\"After Forever\\" , Black Sabbath shows how heavy metal is meant to be played.
0671027573|5.0|Jaine and her friends make you want to make up your on list. The first few meetings with Sam are very very funny. Jaine wakes up one morning and looks out her kitchen window, and guess who's  standing in front of his kitchen window in all his glory? That's when everything starts between Jaine and Sam. This book will make you wish you had a Sam in your life. The ending is not that suprising, but it is a very good read. If you enjoy LH books you will love this one.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I didn't like the version shown in theaters during the summer of 2005. You could tell that the movie was missing those cruical moments in the story. And the director's cut puts those scenes back in.  Kingdom of Heaven is still not a better movie than Gladiator. But now...it's a pretty good movie.
B00000055E|5.0|I'm surprised how this album has been accepted. Lets not get carried away with \\"his legacy\\" and his tragic death and all the controversy surrounding 2Pac.  Everybody already knows about all that.       R U Still Down is my favorite album by 2Pac.  Makaveli and All Eyez are both 5 stars to me, but R U Still Down is more raw.  Especially as far as the production is concerned.  A lot of people are apparently disappointed by the production on this album.  I find it to have a sense of being more genuine, and more fitting than the other posthumous releases.  This is probably since Pac actually had some input on creating these tracks.  Overall, the sound of the album (and individual tracks) is more whole.  Listening to R U Still Down helps to show how much of a project Makaveli and All Eyez On Me were.   Those two albums were obviously much more orchestrated and calculated, and designed to provoke in every way.  They were much more surgical and precise.      R U Still Down, however, is just straight hip-hop. There's scratching on here!  There's no name dropping, or disses aimed at specific people.  Just general expression of different emotions.  Instead of a song about Tipper Gore or Bad Boy (for example) specificly, you get the more general (and undated) song about the struggles in general with government oppression or social commentary or anger or whatever.  This is technically easier for a listener to relate to, since hardly any of us actually know Tipper Gore or Puffy, etc.....but somehow the audience doesn't want that.  wtf?      \\"Thug Style\\" is probably the single song by Pac to most adhere to the street chronicling and nostalgic waxing scenarios in hip-hop.  And at the same time, he's replying directly to everybody giving this album bad reviews:  'you don't know my style.'    Just because All Eyez sounded one way, or Makaveli sounded one way, or Strictly 4 My sounded one way....don't get it twisted.  Its art.  You gotta be open.  Don't expect artists to be how you want them to be.  You cannot expect anything from art, all that does is turn it into a product instead of art.     The lyrics on this album are of things more accesible to the common listener.  The production is reminiscent of earlier 2Pac and more of a east-coast style of the early 90's (pre-Death Row).  There's more lyrical acrobatics than usual (Let Them Thangs Go), and more of the same techincal (Lie to Kick It) and simple formats (F*** All Y'All) we're used to from 2Pac.      If you ignore all the hype and controversy surrounding the artist, and drop your expectations of him...just listen to the music on R U Still Down for the music, then maybe you can re-discover the best MC with this album.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I thought the movie was going to be terrible, but I found myself enjoying it quite a lot.  It has a look that stays true to Peter Chung's Animated Series, even though that tone it down for PG-13, and Charlize Theron wasn't too bad as Aeon Flux ( even though I think Rhonda Mitra would've been perfect for the role.) I really loved Graeme Revell's score to the movie, gotta get the soundtrack. All in all, I liked it.
B000002TQV|2.0|im sorry but this album is horrible!!my first and lasst listen tossed it out on I495 expressway!! musically they are ok but they cant sing and the songs are lame! dont waste your time they sound like they want to take a nap!! thats my opinion, sorry
0780622553|4.0|Dark City was better movie than I remember. It had a great story, but the editing for the movie just screwed it all up.  But still a very good movie.
B000AARKOO|4.0|One of the better movies I have seen.  Not only is there good action/fight scenes - and excellent character development.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Now that I'm older I understand the complexities of this movie much better. There are many plots & sub plots here with excellent performances by the cast. It makes strong statements about heros, legends, mean bullies and \\"the Taming of the West.\\"
0316236535|5.0|My 4 year old preschoolers always LOVED this book so, when I bought it for my 2 year old son, I knew he would love it too.  He started naming parts of the face because of this book and knows it by heart.  We bought it for a 2 1/2 year old friend who was going through a phase: she was \\"scared of monsters\\" at night.  Her mom said this book helped her overcome her fear!  She simply tells the monster \\"Go Away!\\"  I buy this book for everyone who has a baby.
0451147367|5.0|I recently picked up a copy of this over e-bay because I had heard a lot of great things about the first book in the collection Rage, also because unfortunately you can no longer buy it new, at least from what I know. When it arrived, I opened the package up and flipped through the book to make sure it was all intact, I then went about my day. That night, at around 12:30, I was bored and picked the book back up and began reading Rage. It was at around 5:00 that morning when I finished, I found it shocking, insightful, intense and any other words you could use to describe a great piece of fiction. It was the first time in my life that I could not put a book down. Not only is it now one of my favorite Stephen King books, it is one my favorite books period. It truly is a shame that it has gone out of print, because I have no doubt in my mind that it deserves to be taught in High School English classes all over North America, right next to 'Catcher in the Rye.' Now I'm looking forward to reading the other three books in the collection. I'm sure they are just as good, if not better than Rage, if that's possible.
0300108834|5.0|I bought this book for my husband. He sat down that week to start to read it and picked it up every night after work until he had finished it. He thought it was quite good. He has a Ph.D. and does lots of scientific reading but loves history.  I'll read it next.
B00005JOQS|4.0|That doesn't make for a great movie title perhaps. But, the truth of the situation is that (despite what the intro to the George Reeves TV show said) \\"Superman\\" is the disguise, and it is Clark Kent who Kal-El really is...adopting a disguise that he wears when he conducts his super-feats, to protect his own identity and privacy, and to protect his family.<br /><br />I enjoyed Superman Returns a great deal, but it didn't ring perfectly for me in just this one area. While Clark returns from his 5-year voyage, to his parents' farm first, and spends time with his Mom, and then goes back to Metropolis and gets his reporting job back at the Daily Planet, he doesn't actually do any investigative reporting, as he is well known to do. On the other hand, perhaps he's just out of it, from his long trip, just a little. It's a small thing, this detail, in a story that otherwise worked quite well for me. It's clear from Clark's actions that it is as Clark, rather than Superman, that he wants to interact with Lois.<br /><br />Our story opens with Clark returning from a 5-year trip, to Krypton and back. He describes Krypton as a \\"graveyard\\" to his mother upon his return. After his short stay with his mother, he heads back to Metropolis, where he gets his old job back, and slowly falls back into his interrupted old life...but with the twists that a five year gap can bring: the love of his life has a child, a fiance, and has moved on.<br /><br />In the meantime, Lex Luthor has also been toiling away. He has a plan (you'll recognize an old theme in this plan of his), and he needs--and steals--Kryptonian technology to execute it. When he hears that his old nemesis has returned, he adapts his plan so as to exact his revenge. Lex's grudge against Superman has strains of truth to it, as he compares Superman to the Greek Titans, and himself to Prometheus...it bears some thinking about.<br /><br />I can't say much more, without spoiling the movie for you. So, let me close with a few other comments. The movie sounds great, re-using the old, familiar themes. The acting...well, it's all reasonably solid, and no one should ever be expecting Oscar performances in these types of movies. The attention paid to the Superman mythos was great to see, from the small touches like the photograph in the Kent home, to the familiar look of the opening credits. And the memoriam in the closing credits was nice to see.<br /><br />It's summertime! Beat the heat, get into the theatre, and enjoy the movie!other comments.

B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney Spears became a pop phenomenom in 1998 after her first single, the Grammy-nominated classic \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" and debut album topped the charts, breaking radio records and garnering acclaim.  Her second effort Oops!...I Did It Again only proves more that the pop superstar brought a lot to the table.  The opener, like its infamous predecessor (\\"...Baby One More Time\\"), instantly became THE song of 2000, again breaking records, easily garnering awards and becoming another of Spears' pop music smashes.  But unlike ...Baby One More Time, in which only one track (the award-winning first single) got most of the attention, Oops!...I Did It Again garnered three other hit singles, two of which nearly reached the popularity \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" received upon release.  \\"Stronger\\" can easily echo \\"...Baby One More Time\\" in its lyrics and \\"Lucky,\\" a Top 10 smash as well, seemed appropriate in telling where Britney Spears herself was at that moment.  Though produced, like many of the bubblegum records of that year, too much, Oops!...I Did It Again remains, like its predecessor, a classic of the bubblegum era and one of Britney Spears' best and most enjoyable works.
B000002UA7|4.0|But every time it rains,<br /><br />  You're here in my head,<br /><br />  Like the sun coming out--<br /><br />  Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.<br /><br />  And I don't know when,<br /><br />  But just saying it could even make it happen.<br /><br />Back in mid-November, I noticed that Kate Bush was releasing a new album. Well, despite my love for \\"Running Up That Hill\\" and \\"Cloudbusting\\" from my teen years, I'd never really explored her music. So, when I realized I was going on my recent road trip to China, I decided to finally rectify that, and picked up a used copy of her collection, The Whole Story.<br /><br />I wouldn't have been ready for this experience back in the mid-1980s; back then, I was all about the singles, and that didn't change until Boston's Third Stage album came into my hands. I was ready, now.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with Kate's work, I would characterize it as singer-songwriter, fused with 1970s-era British progressive rock. You can hear tinges of Pink Floyd, Supertramp, and Peter Gabriel in spots throughout the 12 tracks on the album. In fact, you may recall that she sang a duet with Peter Gabriel, which appears not on this CD but on his 16 Golden Greats collection.<br /><br />For the most part, these are solid winners here on the CD, and I really became fond of \\"Babooshka\\", \\"Breathing\\", and \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" (which is super-short!).<br /><br />I'm glad I picked this up...it's going to be on rotation on my iPod for a while, I suspect.
B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill was really hated by critics, and the only conclusion I can come to for that is that they don't realize its style. Sure, Silent Hill is hard to understand, but calling this movie \\"incoherent\\" or \\"stupid\\" definitely means you don't catch what it's all about. <br /> <br />To start, this movie is a nightmare. From the part Radha Mitchell's character crashes in the town of Silent Hill until the screen goes black and the credits role, Silent Hill will send you on a terrifying psychological free-fall. There isn't one moment that I didn't feel like I was in another world during this time. It truly feels like an actual nightmare. <br /> <br />Without the art direction in this film, it wouldn't be what it is. Christophe Gans has truly payed attention to capturing a dreamy, surreal look throughout the movie. All of it looks great, and the music just adds more to the nightmare feeling that the movie presents. <br /> <br />I'd have to say that this movie is a first for me. I've never quite seen a good horror movie, but I can tell you that this is one. It seems the producers of this movie decided to take a different approach. Instead of trying to build up suspense and then offer cheap \\"jump\\" scares, it instead grasps you by the collar of your shirt and leaves you sitting, wide-eyed, squeezing the side of your seat, waiting for something to end. While this movie probably isn't scary enough, it still does a good job of being sick, gory, and disturbing. <br /> <br />The movie does have some bad points that convinced me to take one star off of the perfect rating. There is a side-story of the main character's husband searching for clues as to what happened to her and this can get very distracting. Some of the lines can be quite cheesy. A lot of the back plot (or at least what you need to know for the following scenes after that, excluding the ending) is explained in one big monologue instead of bit-by-bit as would be less painful. Yes. some of this movie has bad points. There. I said it. <br /> <br />But the rest makes up for it. One of the things that caught my attention most in this movie was the religious cult that is trapped in the town. Critics just don't get what these people are about so they just go off and talk in their annoying, pompous voices about how stupid the lines they say are and how confusing it is that they try to explain the movie. THEY ARE F***ING CRAZY. THEY DON'T TRY TO EXPLAIN THE MOVIE BUT THEY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY THINK IT IS.  <br /> <br />This movie didn't make much sense on the first viewing to many people, and they hated it for that, which I believe isn't very fair. You have to pay attention to everything the characters say, to what's happening, to everything, to understand the ending and what the characters don't come right out and explain to you. Like I said, this movie has its own style, and you have to realize that before you go off and say it's stupid. <br /> <br />I heard a reviewer on a different site, I think his name was like Humby or something, say that the monsters in this movie have no point. Here's what I have to say to him: They do to have a point in this movie. You just didn't look at the movie enough before you said it was horrible. <br /> <br />This movie is definitely a buy.
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|well, how can they sell such a Blu Ray disc... the image is not so good - with black grainy dots showing up on the screen sometimes, and the resolution is not so high.  So later when it is done properly, it will be sold again for another 20 or 25 bucks huh?  I'd say people who bought this version should be entitled to a replacement of the proper production level product. <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|With his debut album, The College Dropout, producer/rapper Kanye West has achieved both real hip hop heads' respect and average pop fans' fascination, balancing out elements of consciousness and entertainment. A line from \\"Breathe In Breathe Out,\\" \\"I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli but is it cool to rap about gold,\\" represents what this album is. <br /> <br />Songs' arguments are diverse, such as ghetto lowlife, feeling towards the current war, uplifting message, homage to soul/R&B, and autobiographical monologue; among them, making fun of higher education sticks out. This has been rare in the hip hop history, as the conscious rappers have considered the higher education important for the black community while gangstas have had no feeling connected to it. To West, making fun of it must be autobiographical and genuine, though this may be one of the major reasons gaining middleclass white teenagers' admiration. <br /> <br />While West may be an O.K. rapper (his lyrics are too straightforward comparing to his fellow Eastcoasters and his smooth voice lacks edge and character), his talent as a songwriter/producer is stunning. Sometimes with the strings he apparently loves and his signature fast-spinned soul tunes, most songs are well composed and have memorable musical moments.
B000035P5E|3.0|The movie is good but like most movies it does not develope the characters. It was a nice try.  It is a good suspense but I read the book first and that made the movie disappointing.  The Needle is too one dimensional in the movie.  Also, the MI-5 official is more critical to the story than the movie portrays.  Also the book's ending ties it all together. It would be hard to put Ken Follet's books on screen unless they are miniseries.
0385336691|4.0|The latest of Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" series does not dissapoint. If you did not start the series in order, go back and start at the first. Reacher is a character whose decision making and personality are built on his past. The character development over the series has led to a more compelling read as the stories move forward. Hard Way starts off with action and it continues throughout. I read it in two days and I normally draw out the excitement for a while. Get the entire series and then read The Hard Way.

0061122416|4.0|This is a well-written, easy-to-read parable about a shepherd boy who sets out to find his \\"Personal Legend,\\" or dream in life. His travels take him from Spain into northern Africa, across the Sahara and into Egypt. Along the way, he meets fortune tellers, dessert dwellers, soldiers, crystal makers, his dream girl and an alchemist among others. He faces all sorts of unexpected obstacles and runs into a variety of characters who have given up their dreams and settled for more a comfortable life. It's a classic story, full of bits of wisdom, and although none of the insights are entirely original, the story packages them nicely. It teeters on the edge of New Age spirituality on occasion, but for the most part the spirituality is just a mix of various religious traditions. Some people have said this book changed their life. I wouldn't suggest that, necessarily, but it's certainly well worth the few hours it takes to read it.

B000E41MS6|2.0|This rating is not for the show, which gets 5-stars. The show is great, but I have a problem with all the crappy extras used as an excuse to charge a ridiculous price.  Having seen this series even before the Sci-Fi Channel aired it, I can attest to the quality of the stories. Christopher Eccleston fantastically portrays our favorite timelord.  In fact I wish he would have chosen to stay on for another year or two.  Two problems with the series itself: 1) most of the aliens on Platform One look like something you'd find in Star Wars, not a good thing; 2) although I like Captain Jack as a character, they could have done without the \\"yag\\" angle (figure it out, as I couldn't get it on here if I had spelled it properly). I felt like I was watching Will and Grace at times. As for my main flaw with the DVDs themselves, if you look around, you can fortunately find bootleg copies of the stories on DVD-R for a much cheaper price, if you just need the episodes and nothing else.
B000EYK4KI|4.0|First: I FINALLY get the Brad Pitt thing after all these years! He has aged marvelously and is both a great-looking guy, and an excellent actor and unexpectedly fabulous comedian, based on his performance in this movie. His facial expressions, body language, and dialogue delivery are superb, and complement those equally great ones by Angelina Jolie extremely well. Quite honestly, I can't remember when I've seen this kind of superlative chemistry between two leads in any recent movie. I had little expectations about this movie; after I'd seen it, I ordered the Unrated DVD so I could enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />So here's the bad part: the Unrated DVD. Yes, I expected there to be a few more possibly graphic or explanatory scenes included, but it never occured to me that there would be DELETED scenes and dialogue from the original movie!!!! And there are several key pieces missing here, including but not limited to:<br /><br />  -  The critical dialogue in the shed just before the end battle, where Jane says, \\"There's no place I'd rather be than here, with you.\\" GONE<br /><br />  -  Eddie awakening to the $400K bounties for the Smiths on his Blackberry. GONE.<br /><br />  -  Jane saying, \\"We need a car,\\" after their house blows up (you just see John say \\"The Colemans.\\").  GONE<br /><br />In addition, the Extras disc 2 isn't very intuitive about finding the extras. However, the Alternate Ending is great, and very prophetic given the current domestic situation of Brad & Angie.<br /><br />I expected to get at least all of the movie I fell in love with and knew word by word, action by action, and this DVD version disappoints. Sad. And it will make me think twice about spending extra money on any future 'Unrated' DVDs from Amazon.
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|The earlier BBC version of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth has compelling characterizations, coherence, continuity, charm, sensitivity and moving music and visuals. This one lacks most of those qualities. With this newer Universal Studios remake, it's as if someone took a finished puzzle, pulled apart the pieces and threw them across the room, then tried randomly to put them back together. If I had watched this production without ever having seen the BBC's earlier one, I would have barely understood what was transpiring. Circumstances occur too rapidly, are never substantively developed, fall into an abyss and then are replaced by other events that demonstrate no depth or development either...My wife and I have viewed the BBC presentation many times, and each time we have experienced a wonderful sense of emotional fulfillment. We watched this Universal version just once---that was more than enough. The most satisfying thing was getting rid of the dvd as soon as possible.

B00004U2GH|5.0|If you happen to be a Johhny Cash fan this is a must for       your collection.  \\"At San Quentin\\" (The Complete 1969 Concert)  captures the unique presence of Johhny Cash.This music cd is performed live.At times Johnny Cash talks between songs.You will be able to hear the audience cheer after he sings one of his great hits.If you already have other johnny cash music,this live version really goes a step further.I think live versions music cds are more enjoyable to listen to.It also comes with a mini booklet including pictures inserted in the cd case for some nice reading about the concert and Johnny Cash.

0393327345|4.0|Yet, I persist, but I'm an anarchist at heart. I'm so anarchist that I rebel against the anarchists doing this da-ditty-da-da dance number.     Tyler Durgan is just the same as I am (da-ditty-da-da!) and my all-time favorite anti-hero. Brad Pitt tried to play him in the movie, but he was too twitchy and not dark and dangergous enough. Tyler is the man that other men wish they were, especially the narrator of this low-down and dirty book. This book reads like a manifesto for fatherless males trying to become men in this feminized world.     This book should be required reading for all men who think they're men, and all the women who think they know men.

0670034711|5.0|I tapped my foot waiting for this book to come out!  I snagged my copy the first day and ran to a local Philadelphia book signing, only to arrive one week early.<br /><br />I devoured the book in less then a week.  I realized, Elizabeth Gilbert is more then just a writer (after reading all her other works), she is Real.<br /><br />Her book starts with an all too real story, for a lot of people out there; she hurts, she cries and she is confused.  Where is love?<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert, after a failed marriage and a failed romance decides she \\"must\\" get her life together, in order to survive.<br /><br />She works with her publisher and gets a fee to do what she wants to do, travel and reconnect with herSelf, if she will write a book about her journey. What a wonderful book she writes.<br /><br />You will learn a lot about yourself as Elizabeth brings you along on her trip to Italy, India and Indonesia.<br /><br />I have had the pleasure of meeting Elizabeth Gilbert, at a book signing.  She brought me to tears, because it was nice to pick up a book that was written by someone who 'knew' what other was going through.<br /><br />Put aside your engraved egos, your 'word association' with god, Buddha, Krishna, etc. and enjoy this wonderful woman's journey.  A journey that everyone takes, at one point or another, regardless of the country, situation, political stance and such.<br /><br />This is a memoir/self-help/philosophical/dramatic/romantic... Keep going... wonderfully, well written book!!<br /><br />I recommend to everyone, regardless of divorce and spirituality.<br /><br />This book is a keeper!<br /><br />Currently on my second reading!<br /><br />Congratulations, Elizabeth!  Namaste!<br /><br />Definitely 5 ++ stars!
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|It's not often that a major star is given the opportunity to star in a re-make of a film. It's happened twice, that I know of: Clark Gable did it in Mogambo (a re-make of Red Dust) and Betty Grable re-made Coney Island as Wabash Avenue. However, I am here to ask if anyone has noticed that the DVD of Mogambo looks a bit soft and blurry in the wide shots. It's only in the close-up scenes that the picture looks sharp and clear. So many reviewers on this site focus on the stars, the director and the story, which is all well and good, but it would be very helpful if there were more emphasis on the picture and sound qualities of the DVDs as well. A great movie can suffer from poor sound and picture quality. It's a shame that some of the major studios do not bother to remaster some of their prints before releasing them. Come on guys, always strive to do better.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Super Spoiler Ahead for those who didn't see the film.  Don't read this if you didn't see the film!<br /><br />Superman Returns was better than the original.  In this version Superman leaves earth for five years to explore the remains of Krypton.  In that time 9/11 occurs.  Lois writes a Pulitzer Prize winning article \\"Why We don't need a Superman.\\"  She eventually develops a relationship with Perry White's son.  We get the impression the offspring is from her bond with her new man.  Although after the first hour we get to see who the son's father really is.<br /><br />There are scenes that make this movie better than the first version.  We don't have Superman changing the course of time to save Lois Lane.  Kevin Spacy plays a much darker and sinister Luther.  Frank Langella portrays the newpaper mogul in a less cartoony fashion that Jackie Cooper did in 78'.  I have to credit the director Bryan Singer for casting a better Lois Lane.  At least this one bears a resemblance to the one in the comics.  Unlike the Lois in Superman: The Movie with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />There was a controversy behind the 78' version.  The original creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were living in poverty with little or no money to live.  It would have been an embarrassment to Warner Brothers and DC comics if there wasn't a settlement to resolve the matter.<br /><br />DC artist, Neal Adams helped Siegel and Shuster obtain a legal defense to fight the case. Until recently the son of one of the creators passed away.  There is a documentary being produced about how the characters were taken away from the creators.  Back in the 1930s there was little known about copyright law.  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights only to regret that for the rest of their lives.  The recent article about the creators was a sad one.  The family has little or no financial benefit from an icon in American Comics.  Till this day the family is still struggling against DC Comics and Warner Brothers to get some sort of financial restitution after over 60 years.<br /><br />There are those who could say that the family is being greedy in asking for some type of financial gain.  I'd like to see the new documentary reveal the fact that the creators had been robbed of recognition and financial security.<br /><br />I don't know if the same is true in Canada and other countries marketing the new Superman movie; but look at all the merchandise!  I remember long ago when the first film appeared there was no where near the amount of cups, T-shirts and anything that could fit the Super logo on it.<br /><br />I do remember purchasing a $2.25 novel written by E. Nelson Bridewell (from DC Comics). It was an unrelated story that took place in the Superman universe. I never got the chance to read it. From what I've read the novel was one of the better ones.  I was surprised there weren't more.  At the time Marvel was releasing their own versions of prose novels.  The books were written by the popular names of the era; Marv Wolfman, Len (Wolverine CO-creator) Wein, and a few others.<br /><br />One of the commercial tie-in products I purchased were the Justice League Unlimited DVDs.  I wondered why the cartoons were played so late in the evening.  Well, the content is adult and is for older kids.  In one of the episodes Superman is under the influence of a flower alien parasite that controls his mind.  The first scene in his dream state shows his bedroom; with wife Lois Lane. Nothing inappropriate in the way of dialogue, but something I didn't expect to see in what is supposedly a kid cartoon. In the story by comics legend Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons of \\"Watchmen\\" fame\\"; Superman sees what his life might have been.  The parasite also gets a chance at Wonder Woman and Batman, but the parasite ends up on the black hat of this episode.  Seeing the villain looked so much like Darkside, I couldn't remember his name. Perhaps it was Mongul or Mogul.<br /><br />The other episodes featured Booster Gold.  Booster is a man who traveled in the past with current inventions and posed them as his own.  To tell you the truth, I stopped reading the comics so long ago, I haven't kept up with the characters anymore.  I just don't have the time.  I do see that the books are oriented to specific age groups more than my generation.  Back in the seventies you'd be lucky if you saw at least three titles with the same hero.  Today there are four, five and even more with the X-Men and Superman.<br /><br />There was a special features section that featured the actors.  The actor who portrayed the Green Lantern, John Stewart was from MAD TV.  It was hard to believe that this fellow had such a deep voice.  And here I thought the actor who played the part was a large guy.  There were other mini features that showed the physics behind Superman's powers.  Superman supposedly flies faster than the speed of sound.  That means video cameras couldn't catch him.  The whole idea of Superman changing in a phone booth is out of date today.  Not in the cell phone era at least.<br /><br />Superman is not the wimpy type that the comics often portrayed him as.  That is one of the aspects the new film touched upon.  Superman was modernized a bit so new audiences could appreciate him.  You could argue that he didn't fight enough for Lois Lane.  However in this film he stood his ground and wasn't a sap in front of Lois.  I did notice how the other actor who portrayed Lois's new beau was Cyclops of X-Men fame.  It looks like he was a contender for the Superman role.<br /><br />The days of skilled pen and ink rendering is gone.  It's created in a computer.  Comics have lost a lot of the nickel, dime charm and technology has taken over.  I like new things, but comics have lost their innocence.  Especially when the books are $2.99 apiece.  It looks like the video games are replacing the regular comics story.  That is why I have purchased the DVD collections of some of the old Marvel Comics.  So far I purchased the first 500 issues of the FF and Spidey and Mad on DVD and CD ROM.  That's enough reading for me for the next 10 years.  I do hope this catches on because I don't have the room to store all those in hard copy.<br /><br />If you like the Super hero cartoons your in for a treat this month.  I just picked up Superman the Animated Series Season 3.  It has 18 episodes with three accompanying directors commentaries.  Bruce Timm has a lot to say about the creation of each show and why decisions were made to streamline them for audiences.  I'd like to see more comics related animation from him.  Each project he's associated with has respect for it's source material.  When Batman: The animated series premiered all those years ago I was expecting a big letdown. I was glad to be wrong.

B000001ESN|5.0|I love every progression that Rush made up until _Grace Under Pressure_, which was the start of a slow and inexorable decline for them (definitely highlighted by some great pieces, sure, but they have never re-ascended to _Moving Pictures_ and this).  _Permanent Waves_, along with _Moving Pictures_, represents Rush's pinnacle.  All the musicians are at their loosest, most-inspired, and most-baroque (however that works: guess you would have to ask them); Peart's lyrical approach is less sci-fi and more philosophically direct, and therefore better; the compositions are at their leanest and hungriest.  A source of perpetual marvel.<br /><br />Yes, I know, you can hear \\"Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\" on AOR just about every day of your life if you tune in, even \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" now and then.  I almost guarantee that you won't hear the last three songs here on AOR, though, and each of them have their own exalted virtues.  But let's take a tour through the most famous songs: \\"Spirit of Radio,\\" well, you've heard it a hundred times, at least.  It might be easy to forget that it is a pivotal moment in rock history, probably the most successful fusion of hard rock and reggae ever, not to mention a marvel of concision for Rush that fits ten minutes worth of highlights into its brief, for Rush, 4 minutes and 57 seconds.<br /><br />\\"Freewill\\" has some of Neil Peart's most memorable lyrics, a wholesale attack on organized religion that makes free-thinking sound like the only sensible (and thrilling) option: \\"All preordained/ A prisoner in chains/ A victim of venomous fate/ Kicked in the face/ He can pray for a place/ In heaven's unearthly escape.\\"  This reverse psychology had everything to do with my slow escape from the orbit of my preacher-father's church, much to his chagrin.  The amazing soloing (especially Lifeson's!) also had everything to do with my entry into the Religion of Rock.<br /><br />\\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is the third most famous song here.  There's a great live version of it on _Exit . . . Stage Left_.  Another great commentary on everything under the sun from Peart and a slow-burning Rush classic.<br /><br />Now, we get to the lesser-known tracks, all of them more than worth shelling out the cheap price for this classic album.  \\"Entre Nous\\" is a relatively brief rocker about relationships that is about as honest as they come.  It's a love song, of sorts, but one that might not make your baby melt in your arms: \\"We are strangers to each other/ Each of us another/ No one else has read/ We've been joined by bonds of love [. . .] Just between us/ I think it's time/ For us to recognize/ The differences we sometimes fear to show [. . .]/ The spaces in between/ Leave room/ For you and I to grow.\\"  Ah, realistic love.  No \\"baby, baby, I need you so bad\\" here.  It's all about reason as the boys provide unreasonably mind-boggling time changes at the drop of a pin.<br /><br />\\"Different Strings\\" is another love song, this one in a minor key, so gloomy that you might almost call it sub-minor.  This one is atmospheric and an underappreciated gem in the Rush catalog.<br /><br />Perhaps the most underappreciated Rush song of all is the epic \\"Natural Science\\" that wraps up this session.  O . . . my . . . God.  This song is more apocalyptic than \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\"  More fierce than \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\" and boasts not only Lifeson's best recorded solo (solo #2), but one of his top five solos besides (solo #1).  All the anger, the anthemic pleading for Mother Earth (oh please help us avoid the destruction of the planet, science . . . oracular lyricism: \\"Forming a world state of integrity/ Sensitive, hopeful, and strong\\"), the love, the genius.  This is Rush at its most abandon-reaking, passionate, jouissant.  I would lay my life down for this song.  Join the eco-army, all ye prog-hippies.  You get the idea.<br /><br />In short, buy this album just for the last three tracks, at least.  \\"Natural Science\\" is the diamond tucked in the Rush catalog, just a little too long for AOR.  This album constitutes the rarefied plateau they reach after an already brilliant career.  The stuff that brings a soul to feel like bursting.the Rush catalog, just a little too long for AOR.

B000002J2D|5.0|I really like this record and I give Rutherford credit for stepping in to play lead guitar. Most of all, the songwriting is getting better and the group is tighter and closer than ever. That can be good and bad. That means no conflicts in the studio which dosen't always make thrilling music, but here they make a superb record and prove it.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I would say that this is the least of Yes's absolute masterpieces (_The Yes Album_, _Close to the Edge_, _Relayer_, _90125_, and maybe _Fragile_), but that wouldn't quite catch what this piece is all about.  This unfolds almost glacially like a Sibelius symphony with a few schizoid stretches thrown in for good measure.  This is Yes's most ambitious album and if you take it for what it is, the truest thing you might be able to say is that it is their most mind-expanding album.

This isn't the kind of album I'd play on the way to work--you wouldn't even get past the build-up.  And that's another thing that makes this album such a treat.

Actually, this song has Alan White's best drumming short of \\"Hold On\\" on _90125_, amongst a storied career.

0375701427|4.0|Are entire lives, and therefore life itself, horrible beyond analysis if tragedy strikes once or twice?  Do extreme situations and extreme personalities define cultures, or do the day-to-day habits of ordinary people?  Are people, like the universe, so complex they are beyond our ken?  Are Americans so simplistic and without resilience that life is one endless spiral downward? This book, beautifully written and often insightful, suggests the answers are yes, the extremes, yes, and yes. I think better philosophy is acheived by a balanced look at life.  That is, I'm assuming an American philosophy and not simply neurotic nihilism was intended by the title and scope of this story. Also, is it my imagination, or do many leading authors go overboard on inventing new styles of writing and forget that simple stories are pleasurable as well as powerful?  I don't think pleasure is a priority for this author. Pity, he'd be great at it.

B000002IZ4|5.0|The massive success of Stone Temple Pilots debut album \\"Core\\" (1992) was something of a mixed blessing for the group. While the album was a runaway smash, ultimately selling eight million copies and spawning such radio staples as \\"Plush,\\" \\"Sex Type Thing\\" and \\"Creep,\\" success definitely came at a price. Almost immediately the San Diego group was viciously and mercilessly attacked and ripped apart by the press. Accusations of ripping off the Seattle grunge scene and jumping on the flavor of the month alternative bandwagon were the most common complaints. \\"Plush,\\" in particular was singled out as plagiarizing Pearl Jam.<br /><br />Truth be told, these accusations were not without merit. While the band insisted that the bulk of \\"Core\\" was written as far back as 1988, the album did sound derivative of the Seattle soundbook. Released in 1992, \\"Core\\" blended the punkish riffs of Nirvana, the baritone growls and stylistic craft of Pearl Jam, and the metallic crunch of Alice In Chains. But with \\"Core,\\" the album was ultra radio friendly, the songs ultra infectious, which made the album both a smash hit and a number one target.<br /><br />Was \\"Core\\" a rip-off? Maybe. A great record? Most defiantly. But where to go from there?<br /><br />Stone Temple Pilots had a lot to prove with their sophomore album. The second album is often the hardest, as the \\"sophomore slump\\" is not uncommon. With their credibility and integrity under so much criticism, STP had to not only come up with a great bunch of songs, they also had to stretch their artistic muscle, lest their critics label them a disingenuous, opportunistic one-album-wonder.<br /><br />Recoded in just one month, STP's sophomore album \\"Purple\\" was released in the spring of 1994. Compared to \\"Core,\\" \\"Purple\\" is a far leaner, muscular album, sounding far less generic. While \\"Purple\\" doesn't sound 180 degrees radically different from the debut, much of the borrowing of the sounds of the Seattle \\"big four\\" (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains) is left behind as STP was starting to find their own voice. With their second album the band sounds tighter, more cohesive. Dean DeLeo's riffs and solos should have been a breath of fresh air for anyone longing for the days of 70s guitar-heavy AOR. Vocalist Scott Weiland, always one for experimenting with sounds (just look at his underrated 1998 solo album \\"12 Bar Blues\\") gives the songs a lot of color, making them far above average. Eric Kretz (drums) and Robert DeLeo (bass) as always, provide an exciting and dynamic rhythm section.<br /><br />Many fans/critics/reviewers have labeled \\"Purple\\" a \\"grunge\\" album. Truth be told, however, \\"Purple\\" doesn't really have the characteristics of the grunge sound. Grunge is all about \\"the fuzz\\" with intense drumming, feedback, a \\"dirty\\" guitar, etc. Bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, early Soundgarden, Hole, Green River, etc, exemplified the grunge sound. \\"Purple,\\" by comparison, is far more commercial. STP was never meant to be an underground band with street cred, as the band lusted after the arenas from day one.  STP wrote songs that were made to be played on the radio, not Sub Pop compilations. And while \\"Core\\" borrowed from the Seattle scene, \\"Purple\\" sees a strong Zeppelin/Sabbath influence, with psychedelic trimmings. In addition, there was nothing anarchic about STP; their songs were well-crafted and, at the risk of sounding cynical, calculated.  So to call \\"Purple,\\" a grunge album is incorrect. Rather, \\"Purple\\" is a fine collection of 70s inspired, muscular hard-rock with a twist of psychedelia.<br /><br />The grinding, sludgy \\"Meat Plow\\" gets things off to a great start and would make Tony Iommi himself proud. The classic \\"Vasoline,\\" a modern-rock staple, is one of the band's all-time greats. The Zeppelin-like riff and strong melody make it incredibly infectious and rock hard. The album takes an unexpected psychedelic twist with \\"Lounge Fly,\\" throwing the listener a curve-ball. The track actuallysounds a bit like Hendrix's \\"Are you Experienced?\\" Destined to be played on classic rock stations in 20 years time, \\"Interstate Love Song,\\" which was the number-one mainstream rock song for nearly four months, is another vintage STP classic. The majestic \\"Still Remains\\" is big and epic in scope, swooping up the listener in a colorful sea of sounds. The sparse \\"Pretty Penny\\" sounds akin to \\"Friends\\" from \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" (1970). The hard-rocking \\"Silvergun Superman\\" wouldn't have sounded out-of-place on \\"Core\\" and while not the album's strongest cut, keeps up the momentum. Featured on the \\"Crow\\" (1994) soundtrack, the epic, ominous \\"Big Empty\\" was another smash from \\"Purple\\" and remains a 90s classic. While most of \\"Purple\\" avoided sounding derivative of anything Seattle, the bone-crunching \\"Unglued\\" and \\"Army Ants\\" sound very Nirvana-esque. However, these two cuts are so infectious, with such great hooks and rock so hard; STP is given a free pass. The haunting, ambitious \\"Kitchenware and Candybars\\" concludes the album nicely. Just when you think the album is done, however, you are hit with the totally bizarre \\"the second album\\" an unlisted bonus track (thus making \\"Purple\\" a collection of \\"12 gracious melodies.\\") Much like how the closing \\"My World\\" from Guns N' Roses \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" (1991) stuck out like a sore thumb, this lounge-lizard ditty is totally out-of-place, but it's cool in its own way and works.<br /><br />With a little bit of Sabbath, Zeppelin, psychedelia, Nirvana and a lounge number thrown in the mix, \\"Purple\\" is a pretty cool, diverse collection of songs. In some ways, \\"Purple\\" is somewhat of an underrated album. While \\"Purple\\" is generally regarded as the band's best work, many of its songs are over-looked. While \\"Purple\\" is renowned for its big singles (\\"Vasoline,\\" \\"Interstate Love Song,\\" \\"Big Empty\\") the album is chock-full of memorable great songs.<br /><br />With \\"Purple\\" STP proved that they were no one-album-wonder.

B000FILW86|5.0|In the summer of 1979 I was a dazed and confused 14 year old. Too young to be a rebel punk but old enough to know that disco sucked! Then suddenly 6 words that would forever change me, \\"I want you to want me!\\" I would be forever branded a true black and white checkerboard Trickie.  I can not count the nights I lay in my darkened room, headphones on, eyes closed, dreaming that I was Robin Zander singing \\"Need Your Love\\" to thousands of screaming Japanese school girls.  Finally a sound I could call my own.   <br /> <br />Since then I have purchased most, but not all of their albums/CD's and seen them live 8 times.  After the respectable, but in my opinion inconsistent last two releases, Cheap Trick delivers a total package from start to finish.  Begining with a traditional Cheap Trick opener (Hello There/Just Got Back) Welcome To The World, every tune that follows is good to excellent. I actually find the first single, Perfect Stranger, co-written with Linda Perry one of the the \\"weaker\\" (and I use that term lightly) tracks.  The CD picks up steam from there with a break at the Beatle-esque, Oh Claire, and then never stops.   <br /> <br />I personally feel that track 3. If It Takes A Lifetime would have been a better choice for the first single.  The entire band shares song writing credits but each member gets their name listed first, I assume for lead credit.  And for a new trick, two standout tracks, Dream The Night Away and All Those Years, give lead credit to Tom Petersson.  Way to go Tom!  But kudos to the entire band for an outstanding piece of work. Please make sure you come to Orlando when you tour.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|In the four years since the release of their last album \\"By The Way,\\" the Red Hot Chili Peppers went from an international rock band to one the biggest musical forces in the world. With that album they built a solid European fanbase that they had already established in America with 1999's phenomenally-successful \\"Californication.\\" Indeed, their last album was the one that made me really appreciate their music and led me to purchase nearly every album in their back catalogue. I own more albums by the Chili Peppers than any other band, so it was with great anticipation that I awaited their new album.<br /><br />When it was announced earlier this year that the project was to be a double-disc titled \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" I knew it was going to be huge. And it has been: the album has hit No.1 in 27 countries to date, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide in its first week of release. I was intimidated to begin with about the prospect of a double-album: more than two hours of music is a lot to get through, and sometimes bands sacrifice quality for quantity. This is definitely not the case here though. I was initially disappointed with the album, but that didn't last long. Now, I am frequently baffled by the consistency and quality of the songs on \\"Jupiter,\\" and how they are all very strong and flow so well. \\"Mars\\" is excellent, too, but slightly less excellent than the other.<br /><br />STADIUM ARCADIUM: DISC 1, \\"JUPITER.\\"<br /><br />This disc opens with the massive first single \\"Dani California,\\" which has become a huge radio hit and will be played for many years to come. \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\" is a potential single, and was one of those songs that stuck out upon first listening to this disc. It's quite long, but never gets boring. The melody is strong and driving, Kiedis' vocals stronger than ever, and the guitar work incredibly atmospheric. \\"Charlie\\" is quite bizarre and unusual, but it does grow on you. I'm not too fond of the vocals on this song, and the lyrics are quite throwaway. It seems to me like this was an attempt to return to BSSM days, but it's still too soft-core and melody-driven to be anything but what it is. The album's title track, \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" is a brilliant song and evokes a melancholy sadness that is surprisingly emotional. Of course I'm not sure what the song's about, but the tone just seems very gloomy. \\"Hump De Bump\\" is a more funk-orientated song that just makes you want to nod your head to the chorus. \\"She's Only 18\\" has become one of my favourite songs on the album, as it builds up to its mammoth chorus in a brilliant way with the verses. Kiedis' whips the rest of the band up into a flurry for the chorus, which rises and falls with the lines, \\"Knock the world, right off its feet and straight onto its head!\\" This song deserves a single release.<br /><br />\\"Slow Cheetah\\" is a slower, more ballad-like song. The chorus is a bit of an anti-climax, but the verses are very well constructed and the breakdown part at 2:53 is very evocative of some deserted landscape. \\"Torture Me\\" is an incredible song and easily one of my favourites the Chili Peppers have ever come out with. It's perhaps the heaviest, most riff-orientated song on this disc, very loud and fast. Kiedis' vocal delivery is amazing, the chorus is a powerhouse, and the trumpet after the first chorus drives me wild every time I hear it! Amazing, amazing song. \\"Strip My Mind\\" is the only song that could follow that, and it does it well because there's a tension and strain here that works with the madness of that previous song. The background vocals in this song work well in just the right moments with Kiedis' verses. \\"Especially In Michigan\\" is another of my favourites, I love how it builds up and by the time the first verse starts, it's like Kiedis' has enough ammo to go on forever. The melody of \\"Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in, wrap me in your cinnamon, especially in Michigan,\\" is one of the strongest aspects of the entire album in my opinion. The lyrics in the background are absolutely amazing, I've never heard such intelligence from this band. The guitar work is amazing: Frusciante has truly excelled himself on songs like this.<br /><br />\\"Warlocks,\\" although not confirmed, appears to be about drug abuse, as Kiedis uses many of his old lingo for drugs that he used in his autobiography Scar Tissue. \\"C'mon Girl\\" is another highlight, mainly because of the rocking chorus where Kiedis sings, \\"C'mon girl, let's get it right!\\" over and over. \\"Wet Sand\\" intrigued me simply by its title. I love beach songs, but this song appears to be anything but. However, it was still nice listening to this as I relaxed on the beach in Zakynthos a few weeks ago. The guitar work is brilliant in the verses and opens up this song to very expansive proportions. The song peaks towards the end where the band all sing, \\"You don't form in the wet sand. You don't form at all.\\" The first disc ends with the fantastic \\"Hey.\\" This is the longest song on the first disc, and is really an amazing piece of work. It has a very 'desert island' feel to it, especially with the incredibly guitar solo at around 4:14.<br /><br />STADIUM ARCADIUM: DISC 2, \\"MARS.\\"<br /><br />This disc opens with \\"Desecration Smile,\\" a brilliant song that sees the band become more laid-back in their pop approach, which begin with Californication and took hold with By The Way. It's not bland, despite what some people say, it's very clever and throbs gently. The chorus is brilliant and the section of, \\"We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise...\\" made me realise just how far this band have come. \\"Tell Me Baby\\" is the album's second single, and opens beautifully with this distant chiming that almost puts you in a trance. However, this is broken, unfortunately, by the guitars and drums that come in to form this funky bulk of the song. It's not a bad thing, it's a very good song: I just wish that intro was longer. \\"Hard To Concentrate\\" is another amazing song, one of my favourites, purely because it has a creepy, eerie quality to it. Kiedis' vocal work is ominous and foreboding, especially just before the second verse when he sings, \\"...Here we go.\\" The guitar that kicks in after this is sunlit and as bright as the yellow page that the lyrics inside the booklet are printed on. \\"21st Century\\" is funkier and has a very catchy verse/chorus/verse segue. \\"She Looks To Me\\" is more softer rock-pop, not a standout, but good nevertheless with a chorus that stands out amongst most others on this second disc.<br /><br />\\"Readymade\\" was hailed as soft ballad mush, when it's anything but. It's quite heavy rock infact, it just doesn't always appear that way due to the vocal arrangement and progression of those vocals. This song has a rolling, rollicking rhythm to it that is emphasised by the syllables in the lyrics. Very good song. \\"If\\" is incredible in my opinion. It's the shortest song on the album, but it's this album's \\"Porcelain,\\" if you like. The guitar work is like a wolf howling at a full moon in the middle of the night up in the mountains - incredibly evocative. Kiedis sings beautiful lyrics, serenading even the most cold-hearted listener. \\"Make You Feel Better\\" is a bit of a disappointment, I can't quite get into this song and I feel it could've been left off. The chorus is good, but that's not enough for me, I have to enjoy the entire song. \\"Animal Bar\\" is a brilliant song, that has this anthem-like section of chanting in unison. I find it rather amusing. The build-up to the chorus is brilliant, it takes quite a while, but its very unique. Never quite heard anything like it. \\"So Much I\\" is another amazing song, very fast and quite repetitive. It works well, though. The guitar work builds more and more with each verse, like a steam train chugging faster, before the chorus kicks in. \\"Storm In A Teacup\\" has background vocals that remind me of \\"Love Rollercoaster,\\" which is fine by me. The guitar work here, again, is amazing, and the chorus harks back to the band's early years. The vocal delivery is outrageous in the way \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" was, too.<br /><br />\\"We Believe\\" doesn't quite impress me like some of the earlier songs do. The way the song ends is brilliant, and the guitar work is strong, but this doesn't stand out to me. \\"Turn It Again\\" has some really amazing guitar work. It's the longest song on the album and builds beautifully. The chorus is so simple and is typical of the type of song on this album that you could easily ignore and think there's nothing special about it. This is not the case; you have to listen and concentrate hard to this music, then the beauty is revealed. Frusciante's solo in this song is incredible, easily some of the best work I think he's ever done. The album ends with \\"Death Of A Martian,\\" a song I was very determined to like since it's the album-closer. It hasn't clicked with me yet, but I'm hoping it will do with repeated listens.<br /><br />\\"JUPITER\\" - OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />\\"MARS\\" - OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />The entire album is a mammoth listening experience. There's so much to take in from both discs, at more than two hours long, it's like a movie, and they could definitely turn this into one, like Green Day with \\"American Idiot,\\" but I don't think that will happen any time soon. The Chili Peppers plan to release a total of seven singles from this album, according to reports, which I think is pretty crazy, but it will see this album sell about 10 million copies by this time next year, mark my words. In time this could well become my favourite Chili Peppers album, but I think it will take maybe a year or two of solid listening and reflection for me to realise this. \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" \\"Californication,\\" and \\"By The Way\\" are the band's top three albums in my opinion, but Stadium Arcadium will sit somewhere in that top three in due course. Overall, an incredible album that will bring in new fans to their ever-expanding fanbase and solidify their place in rock history.another amazing song, one of my favourites, purely because it has a creepy, eerie quality to it.

B000AADYYO|1.0|I have been putting off reviewing this album for a year now. I was completely disgusted with this CD the first time I heard it. I didn't even want to think about it. However, now I think I am finally ready to come to terms with the downfall of one of my favorite bands. Allow me to get this out of the way first -- this is a bad album. And yes, all of the instruments are played well, but what is lacking on this release are songs that are actually memorable. I really wanted these guys to go into a completely different direction after Deliverance. I think that most of us will agree that Deliverance was a decent culmination of all of their work. It pushed Opeth's sound as far as it would go, and it was apparent that the band would stagnate if they didn't evolve on their next release. They needed a serious Morningrise to My Arms, Your Hearse transition. And even though Ghost Reveries may appear to be different on the surface, Opeth's sound really hasn't evolved. In reality, Opeth has simply decided to incorporate generic drop tuning riffs and cliche prog keyboards into their music. Ripping off of Tool is not exactly my idea of progression. Stealing riffs from a band that is far less than your own is not exactly my idea of brilliant songwriting. And, sure enough the same old Opeth cliches are present on this album. Nothing sounds fresh or daring. There are no risks....  <br /> <br />But that is their trademark sound, you say. That is very true... But, they once incorporated twin guitar harmonies into their music, as well. Opeth needs to change... they need to experiment. They need to do more than just change their tuning. Sure, keyboards may be a nice addition, but it didn't seem like they needed them before. You need to change, Opeth. Put out another Damnation if that is the kind of music you want to play. Don't feel obligated to placate the heavy metal crowd. You have done that for long enough already.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing sees Porcupine Tree taking the ideas they employed on their masterpiece In Absentia a step further, while also returning to their earlier, more psychedelic period in some spots. It still retains the heaviness of In Absentia with some songs being their heaviest yet, but overall, I'd give the edge to In Absentia, as it's an album that relies less on Porcupine Tree's space rock era and more on Steven Wilson's new-found love for bands like Opeth, Tool and Radiohead.<br /><br />This album is actually based on a film script written by Wilson and his friend Mike Bennion, and was described as being \\"a surreal supernatural ghost story\\". Given their amazing concerts on their Deadwing tour, with the huge video screens behind the band visualising the concept, this is definitely a darker and more morose album than its predecessor. The songs on it are characterized by despair and terror, as well as fear and paranoia. The ambitious title track will sound immediately familiar if you, like me, have played In Absentia a million times and still can't get enough of it. Yet, the inclusion of vague electronics that begin in the first second and won't let go till the end, which nearly sees the ten-minute mark, suggest Steven Wilson did seek new ways of expressing himself. Without taking too long, a growling bass figure is thrown into the mix which quickly merges with a wall of rhythm guitars and dark synth effects barraging the listener. The vocal harmonies are as brilliant as ever, always leaving enough space for more atmospheric, tranquil passages that are marked by echoic key swells, before being followed by a demented lead guitar solo courtesy of King Crimson's Adrian Belew, reflecting his demented songwriting vision. By now, the soundscapes of Deadwing have already been defined and the listener is in for a real treat.<br /><br />Unlike the band's more focused and cohesive styles heard on their previous releases, such as Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream, Deadwing attempts at a larger scope, combining all of the strongest aspects of Porcupine Tree's earlier albums, as it also opts for heavier and more aggressive musical statements. \\"Shallow\\" is possibly the heaviest Porcupine Tree song yet, marked by rock's visceral, groove-based approach to rhythm and an explosive main riff that highlights Wilson's somewhat catchy vocals during the chorus. Much like this, \\"Halo\\" is another addition to the heavier songs on Deadwing in that it combines a big, funky bass drive with industrial effects and leads into another guest solo by Adrian Belew amidst incomprehensible spoken vocals and clever drum fills. Similarly, \\"Open Car\\" sees the band marrying lighter sounds with more guitar-friendly segments where cascading riffs blend with some of the finest vocal harmonies Wilson came up with before the song returns to its calm, peaceful start and closes with gently strummed acoustic guitars.<br /><br />Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt appears on the album, singing harmong vocals on three songs, one of them being the Blackfield-like \\"Lazarus\\", a song that encompasses both psychedelic atmospherics generated by slide guitar and poppy vocals that sound perfect over Barbieri's remarkable piano playing. The song has various sound effects at the end, which I assume are related to the script of the not-yet-filmed movie. However, Akerfeldt's presence is most noticeable on the longest track \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\", easily an instant Porcupine Tree classic. Its spacey intro builds up patiently, exciting the listener further with each passing second, as distant acoustic guitars are heard rising and taking the lead, whilst being surrounded by amazing Mellotron sounds. Akerfeldt underpins Wilson's vocals during the pre-chorus (which is a bit evocative of their fantastic duet on Opeth's \\"Bleak\\" from Blackwater Park) and the song makes a foray into a punishingly heavy mid-section with thundering guitars, bass and drums joining in order to create anguish-ridden chaos. There are two solos on this piece, the second one being played by Mikael Akerfeldt and displaying his minimalistic blues licks. The ending of this track is particularly striking.<br /><br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is a poignant pop tune, again reminiscent of Wilson's Blackfield project with excellent backing harmonies and a decidedly heavier second half thanks to the addition of drums and bass. This part also features a terrific vocal melody by Steven Wilson. However, \\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" may be the second best track on the album, not only because it finds the band returning to their psychedelic roots, but also because it was co-written by Gavin Harrison to let him shine in a very Floydian environment. Great cymbal work glistens over funky bass motifs and Barbieri's exquisite electronic samplings. The song quickly moves into a passage for solo piano before Barbieri also brings in some majestic synth elements creating ever-colourful melodies as Harrison busies himself with gorgeoous jazz drumming. From here on, the same melody is repeated on Wilson's guitar; just like Barbieri, Wilson starts out with acoustics and then drapes cutting lead work on it. Simply put, the compositional quality of this song is stunning.<br /><br />The album also features a hidden bonus track of \\"Shesmovedon\\", that kicks in after the narcotic \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\", the only song with equal input from each member. It particularly emphasizes Barbieri's deft piano and Harrison's hypnotic cadences, however.<br /><br />The artwork, except for the poor quality of paper used, is also amazing by the way, and reminds me of Radiohead's Kid A with lots of twisted imagery and interesting lyrics. After hundreds of listens, Deadwing is still going strong. What's more, it gets better each time. You should not pass on it if you're a fan of progressive music.ece, the second one being played by Mikael Akerfeldt and displaying his minimalistic blues licks.

B00005JMEW|3.0|First of all, I liked Tarantino's first two films. And I used to think that he had a promising career ahead of him, but Kill Bill just doesn't do it for me. These movies are so unbelievably lame that I would rather watch the B-movies that inspired them. That is basically what you are getting here, but \\"oh, it's a melting pot of various influences, you say?\\" I know what Quentin set out to do here and I don't like the final results. It seems like everyone's favorite video store clerk just can't come up with anything decent anymore. Jackie Brown was a total lackluster attempt at trying something different. Kill Bill is Tarantino returning to what he does best, but the material is just not as entertaining as his previous efforts. Poking fun of rednecks and white trash yet again... didn't we already cover that in Pulp Fiction?  <br /> <br />What is with the repetition in this film?  <br /> <br />Revenge is the theme here, but unlike most revenge films you just don't care about the bride's quest for vengeance. Yeah, so she was shot in the face. Big deal... Movies like \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" and \\"Old Boy\\" are much better revenge flicks. You actually feel like something horrible/inhumane has happened to the main character and you want to see the perpetrators suffer the most violent deaths imaginable. In Kill Bill you may actually fall to liking the bad guys even more than the bride. What does that accomplish? Nothing, really... this is a basic Tarantino movie. You go to see it to be entertained, but I wasn't very entertained. Often times I can overlook the superficiality of Tarantino's work, but not here because this movie suffers from an overall lack of creativity. And if I feel like I am in the mood for Asian cinema or Spaghetti Westerns, then I will watch them. I don't need to see a film that rips off of them, or rather packages them together nicely into a finished product.  <br /> <br />In other words, Tarantino has had an accomplished career. His first two movies are among the most influential of the 90's, but guess what... he is no longer the newest thing. His movies are no longer cutting edge and hip. Let me just put it this way: Quentin ripped off of his favorite directors and since then everyone has ripped off of him. Seeing a movie with Tarantino influences is not uncommon nowadays. And since there is no depth to any of Quentin's movies, there is just no reason to see them more than once. If that is the case, then what makes his work superior to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg pop corn flicks? After all, if all he sets out to do is entertain, then that is essentially what his films amount to.... just instead of using cgi he relies on savvy dialogue and ideas from other movies.       <br /> <br />But, I will be sympathetic here... and give him three stars for effort. After all, even if this movie is not the masterpiece that people make it out to be it is still better than most of the tripe that Hollywood produces nowadays.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie picks up where the first one leaves off.Selene is being hunted by Marcus for the murder of Viktor.They do take you back to the year 1202 where the war between Death Dealers and Lycans begins.If you buy this get the first Underworld and enjoy both back to back.
B000002O5L|5.0|I was especially pleased with the cover of the Byrd's Feel a Whole Lot Better -- I didn't know that was on there.
B00005JKCH|5.0|It was in the summer of 2002, when The Web-Slinger finally hit the big screen. Toby Maguire asumed the role of the web-head and portarys Spidey truly. The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst also steps up for the film and she takes on the role of Mary Jane Watson. Director Sam Rami, a fan of the comics, keeps the story and details of Spidey's world as true as one can with today's technology. When Peter Parker is bitten by a geneticly enchanced super-spider, he receives more than just a painful infected bite. The once skinny photographer wakes up a morning after the incident, and soon realizes that he has developed more than just bigger muscles, and better vision. In the next few days, Parker discovers what new abilites he has been given and how they will help him change the world. Except, his quest for good is soon disrupted when the existance of The Green Goblin is finally revealed at a public gathering of Oscorp associates and family members in downtown New York. Parker comes to the conclusion that it is up to him and his alter-ego to stop the hostile menace in order to protect the ones he loves. But, the duration of the battle and its grand finale between the duo may be too much for the young Peter Parker to handle.
B00005JMYI|2.0|Overall, I didn't think the movie was very funny. I love Will Ferrell, but he's definitely had better movies. There were a couple of very funny parts, but everything in between was a little dull and bland.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|The CD's were a perfect length of time.Anthony's vocals are at there best.Individual artwork in the boxset was cool! DVD was perfect at explaining the meaning to the songs.You can tell by listening to the CD's that RHCP's put their all into this project.
B000001FDK|5.0|If you love the movie you will just LOVE this soundtrack. It is the perfect mix of all kinds of music.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Oh yes this good and I love the series. The other film was just better but this one has its high points also. You really  have to see the 1st film to get  this one. The Fight scenes were well done, the Plot is cool and its like a video game with all of its activities. Worth the Buy if you are  into the series.
B000EGDB10|3.0|I am a big fan of this movie but there's nothing special about this, so-called \\"Collector's Edition\\" which only seems to have been issued in order to have something tied up for the release of MI3. <br />There are a few short clips on how the incredible set pieces were made but no new interviews, deleted scenes, commentaries, etc. The featurettes included are as shallow as they can get. This is too bad given the many years we had been waiting for a special edition of this movie. Compare this to the incredible SEs Fox has been issuing of movies such as the Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Nine to Five, Planet of the Apes, etc. and it feels like somebody at Paramount ought to be fired.
B000FGFSPG|5.0|I've got to admit that I was a little worried about how this DVD would turn out.  \\"From Wishes to Eternity\\" is my favorite DVD bar none- could it be matched?  Most of the live clips I've seen since FWTE, have been reasonably good, but not spectacular.  Big stages have seemed to diminish band interaction and the immediacy & impact of the performances, the band has looked kind of static and audio quality has been nothing great, at best.  Then there's the whole Tarja situation and its still lingering aftermath.... <br /> <br />Well fellow NW acolytes and all you \\"civilians\\" out there, have no fear because this show and DVD/box is another great Nightwish experience.  High energy all around, the intensity level stays up throughout the entire show, everyone in the arena seems to be fully engaged in the event, the band's performance is great, the audio is the best yet, and the video work is generally solid too.  Realistically, its just about as much as one could hope for as far as capping things off in a positive and energetic way. <br /> <br />So, some details...  Its nice and long....18 songs with a concert length of 100 minutes.  Despite reputedly having the flu that day, both Marco and Tarja sound fantastic - at the top of their form.  Marco adds a lot of onstage chemistry, as you would expect (who was that surly looking guy with a bass on FWTE anyway).  Tarja looks fully engaged and she appears to be enjoying herself.  Her whole situation really wasn't much of a factor for me, while watching the show, although it does kind of enter your awareness once the last couple of songs come along.  Forget about picking highlights, there are just too many, but if I must I would take \\"Bless the Child\\", \\"Ghost Love Score\\" - especially when the red confetti falls towards the end, and \\"Over the Hills\\".  Don't agree? Well, I could just as easily pick Marco's brilliant rendition of \\"High Hopes\\", the best performance of \\"Sleeping Sun\\" I've seen, and the dynamic blast of \\"Dark Chest ofWonders\\".  The point is that there is an awful lot to be thrilled with, just as was the case with FWTE. <br /> <br />One thing I really want to make note of is how good the \\"Century Child\\" material sounds.  Even if you were never crazy about songs like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" or \\"Ever Dream\\" chances are you will love them here.  This has a lot do with audio clarity, I think.  The vocals are much more upfront and present than on the \\"Century Child\\" CD and there seems to be less smearing and greater clarity in the overall mix.  Even \\"Bless the Child\\", which was already one of my very favorite Nightwish songs, sounds better here.  It really makes me wish more of \\"Century Child\\" had been included; it would have been pure bliss to have \\"End of All Hope\\" and \\"Beauty of the Beast\\" on there as well.  Although this may sound a bit heretical and strange, I'd have to say it could have been better to replace \\"Kinslayer\\" and \\"Wishmaster\\" with more \\"Century Child\\" tracks.  We already have great performances of those on FWTE and the \\"End of an Era\\" versions don't quite stack up to the FWTE versions. <br /> <br />The DVD would also be an excellent introduction to Nightwish for those unfamiliar with the band, even for non-metal fans.  I've used FWTE for this purpose quite a bit.  Just the other day, six or eight people in my family - none of whom have any particular inclination towards heavy music - became very interested upon accidentally seeing a couple of clips from FWTE.  So now I'm buying that many more copies of FWTE and Wishmaster to get them started.  End of an Era would be just as appealing in that way.  Although at current prices and availability I may have to hide \\"End of an Era\\" and hope a cheaper NTSC version appears someday!  <br /> <br />Now naturally there are things that I think could have been done better or differently.  There is an awful lot of fast cutting, especially in the beginning of the show.  There are a lot of nice camera angles, moving pan/zoom shots andso on, but it seems like there are so many cuts that the pacing is too fast - it can actually feel a little disorienting at first.  It does seem like less of an issue upon repeat viewings, maybe that's the intention.   I thought the added visual effects were unnecessary - they don't mesh as well as with the quasi high-def feel of \\"End of an Era\\" as they did with the video on FWTE .  At times the add-ons were pretty distracting:  superimposed flames during parts of \\"Ghost Love Score\\" - please - isn't it powerful enough already?  Cheesy!  And who are those crying girls anyway?  With 12,000+ people present, let's see more variety in audience shots.  There are other things that could be argued, but really there's nothing seriously amiss here - all of these issues are mainly in the realm of fun fan debate. <br /> <br />Remember that this is strictly PAL video at this point in time; it may not work in your Region 1 DVD player.  Even certain of my players that accept other PAL DVDs won't play this one.  It is fine, though, in any player I tried that specifically accepted PAL and it is fine in any PC or Mac that I tried it on.  Some may notice sync issues with this DVD; it actually looked more noticeable to me than on FWTE.  That's if its really there at all - sometimes I wonder if I'm really seeing it or not.  I have noticed the same phenomenon on the Therion DVD that just came out; it makes wonder if this has to do with PAL to NTSC conversion artifacts or if there's some sort of framing glitch when certain devices play back PAL video. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm really pleased with \\"End of an Era\\" and extremely grateful to Tuomas and all for producing another masterful and memorable Nightwish treasure.  I guess I have two favorite DVDs now; here's hoping the era to come matches up to the past and that I can up that number in a few years time..... <br /> <br />
B00004LN16|5.0|I just wanna start out saying that I love this CD and it was the first album of ACDC that i bought. I would give this 4.5 stars (but i couldnt) because after getting Back in Black and some of thier earlier albums, Stiff Upper Lip just seems weaker and not as well written as their earlier albums. It is still an awesome Album. <br /> <br />Stiff Upper Lip-10/10 <br />This is one of my favorite songs on the Album, its fast paced yet powerful, it makes u wanna start breaking stuff. <br /> <br />Meltdown -9/10 <br />It's a good song, I didnt really like it at first, then i started listening to it some more and now i like it better <br />It's got alittle blues to it and its still powerfull like all ACDC songs. <br /> <br />House of Jazz 8/10 <br />this wasnt one of my favorites, but it is still as good as any bands' songs today. <br /> <br />Hold Me Back 8.5/10 <br />I liked this song, i just didnt think it was as powerful as teh otehrs and the lyrics just seemed weak 2 me but its still better than most other bands. <br /> <br />Safe in New York City 10/10 <br />This is one of my favorites on the Album, u have Angus tearing out the floor boards with his guitar, and uve got Brian tearing out his vocal cords, its a great song, one listen and ul love it. <br /> <br />Cant Stand Still 9/10  <br />Its a good, well written song, but not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Cant Stop Rock and Roll 10/10 <br />this is my absolute favorite song on the album. It's classic ACDC, Rock hard, play loud, and dont look back. <br /> <br />Satallite Blues 8/10  <br />I liked the song, it was good, but i just didnt think it was as good as some of the others. <br /> <br />Damned 8.5/10 <br />I liked this song, but it just feels like its missing something, it still surpasses most other rock bands' songs. <br /> <br />Come and Get It 9/10  <br />It's a good song, but its not great either. <br /> <br />All Screwed Up 8/10  <br />it was alright, but u might think different. <br /> <br />Give it Up9.5/10 <br />Great song, great closer to a great album. <br /> <br />I'm gonna conclude sayin that ACDC's still got it after 30+ years. Its a great album. It's loud and powerfull, wich is wat ive come to expect from ACDC, if u havent bought it yet then get ure as5 out there and buy it. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JOQS|5.0|As an extreme Superman fan, I totally enjoyed this movie.  It was more than I ever expected, and the pieces all fell into place.  Brandon Routh is wonderful, and is more than able to continue this franchise.  Kate Bosworth is terrific as Lois, and I must admit I had misgivings before seeing the movie; but she acquited herself very well.  Personally, I can't wait to see the next two films, so here's hoping we don't have to wait another 20 years...................
B00028HBKM|5.0|Was it disturbing?  YES!<br />Was it brutal?  YES!  But the Truth often is.<br /><br />This is, by far, the most realistic version of the Passion and Death of Our Blessed Lord that has ever been depicted on TV/film.<br /><br />Applause goes out to each and every actor, as they brought out emotions which previous versions, depicting scenes of the suffering and death of Christ, haven't even come close to doing.<br /><br />To the critics, who complained that the movie was all \\"blood and gore\\":  What did you expect from a flagellation and Crucifixion?  You knew what this film was about before viewing it, yet you criticized it for showing what it was 'Supposed' to show:  \\"The last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ\\".<br />Suffice it to say; this was probably tame compared to the actual event.<br /><br />Definitely a film every Christian should own.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is truly a classic movie. Everything is wonderful, it is beautiful to watch with gorgeous costumes and sets. The story is fun and exciting and the children are adorable. It has everything I want in a children's movie and is as enchanting for adults.
0064430227|5.0|40 years ago I purchased this book for my 5 year old child, not having much expectation other than it being a fun, cute book for my son to enjoy. Subsequent to reading the book I don't know who delighted more in its story, myself or my child!  Thinking maybe the comprehension of my child was vastly different than mine, I asked him what he felt the story was telling us.  He responded \\"It's about making your own world!\\".  My son nailed it.  HAPC is a provacative venture into the imagination-and more.  It is our capability of managing and creating our own world.  HAPC really does make the point that we do \\"make our own world\\".  I bought this edition for my 5 year old granddaughter, reading and delighting it in again, was as though I was saying hello to a wonderful friend gone from my life for 40 years. <br />
B005NFJAMG|5.0|In the modern world, Exec Dec strikes closer to home than it originally intended as it eerily foreshadows 9/11 and other acts of terrorism. It makes for a perfect flip-side companion piece to the little-seen Paul Greengrass film United 93. In the world of Exec Dec the heroes save the day and America wins. In United 93 (and the real world) life isn't that simple. But since this was made 5 years prior to 9/11 it should be judged purely as entertainment and not as any political statement.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays David Grant, a United States Naval Academy graduate who works counter-terrorist expert for Army Intelligence who is called into the Pentagon when a group of Muslim extremists taken over a flight from Athens to Washington DC. After blowing up the restaurant of the London Marriott, they demand that their recently captured terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa (think O.B.L.) be released and that they be given millions of dollars in gold bullion. Grant, suspects that this is merely a ploy to get into US airspace to set off a massive bomb rigged with huge supply of DZ-5 poison gas.<br /><br />Their only apparent option is to blow the plane up over the ocean, killing everyone on-board and sending any evidence that they might have straight to the bottom of the Atlantic. But Colonel Travis (that's Steven Seagal folks!) suggests hooking up the 747 with a modified F-117x Remora stealth bomber while it's still in the air so he and his commandos can kick some terrorist ass. Dragged along for the ride, Grant and computer nerd Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt) are to supervise the link-up and identify Cell Leader Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) from the Remora. But the link-up falters and only 4 commandos plus Grant and Cahill make it on-board. Travis is killed and the Remora is destroyed, along with most of their equipment.<br /><br />With only a few hours before the plane reaches US airspace and the bare-minimum of equipment the group have to sneak around in the crawlspaces of airplane attics, cargo bays, and elevator shafts searching for the bomb and spying on the terrorists.<br /><br />It's highly intense, superbly photographed and expertly edited entertainment. What first attracted me to Exec Dec was obviously the casting of Russell and Seagal but link-up with the Remora and the 747 is definitely one of the most unique action scenes in the past two decades and was the major selling point of the film for me.<br /><br />I do realize that Seagal has many critics and most of them judge him far, far to harshly and play up his character's death in this film claiming that the only good thing about Exec Dec is 'the death of Seagal 10 minutes into an extended cameo'. Which is a totally foolish and untrue thing to say. Seagal is in the movie for a full 45 minutes before he dies. Which was done to shock the audience into believing that if Seagal dies then any of the cast could be next. And even if you're a Seagal hater (understandable considering his recent poor output) don't let that overshadow the rest of the film which is, in it's final half-hour, so exciting that you'll be so on the edge of your seat that you won't actually be sitting on it.<br /><br />It does lose some of it's power when compared to the horror-show that is United 93, but like I said, they are either side of the same coin. In the world of Executive Decision the terrorist attacks of 9/11 would never have happened. And if 9/11 was an always inevitable event, then I guess the film IS far-fetched. But it was made pre-9/11 for entertainment, nothing else, so I guess I can forgive it for being so.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks great in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. It's a HUGE improvement over the horrible, ancient DVD. Sadly, the only extra is a trailer.ane attics, cargo bays, and elevator shafts searching for the bomb and spying on the terrorists.<br /><br />It's highly intense, superbly photographed and expertly edited entertainment.

B000002U88|3.0|I've bought the vinyl LP version of this album, because someone had recommended it to me. <br />I'm not a Bob Seger's fan, but I found the music of this album  much too simple, \\"déjà vu\\", and pretty boring for me who is usually into progressive rock.  <br />I nevertheless gave 3 stars, because I might not be very objective to judge this sort of music, and I don't want to make Bob's fans too angry. <br />Simply put, I could not believe my eyes when seeing this record had an average rating of more than 4 stars, so wanted to correct a little bit this.

B000001FKY|2.0|I am a huge Def Leppard fan: love On Through the Night, High 'N' Dry, and Pyromania. So tonight i finally broke down and bought Hysteria. I listened to \\"Def Leppard's best\\" and it is awful. Listening to this album after listening to High 'N' Dry is like going from a steak and bar-b-que diet to eating sushi and broccolli. It just doesn't go over well. I might have to go and puke out the over-produced and over-thought out \\"licks\\" of this album. Perhaps if i had gotten this album before Pyromania then it might have gone over better. Thank goodness i bought Pyromania first! Pre-Hysteria Def Leppard rocks, sushi Leppard sucks. The songs on this album are just too slow, or sound \\"fake\\" per-say. Def Leppard must've been *Wasted* when they made this album.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|They are not and I repeat not a one star band, but I have cracked the \\"Korn Code\\" if you bought an album after the first one....your wrong! Though I will admit I got suckered into the second. Instead when you hear that \\"one song\\" you like... download it, in the end you will be less pissed that all the other ones suck and you spent 14 dollars on a collection of songs that you can't tell the difference in. Besides they have not had an original album since the first... Everyone is the same!
0312330529|5.0|This book is quite simply the most absorbing book I can recall reading. And I read alot. The characters ar all imbued with a degree of soul that makes one wonder how can anyone be so alive and get so much out of life. Sights, sounds, smells and colors  paint each page and draw the reader into a culture so far removed from anything 'Western' it is difficult to describe. In their best days, Louis Mayer and Cecil DeMille never created anything remotely as grand and sweeping as this epic. For anyone willing to be touched at their core.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Any fan will tell you that when Tim Burton announced that Michael Keaton was his Batman, there were gasps of disbelief and horror.  Tim Burton and Michael Keaton, however, made us believers.  After the first two movies, Burton and Keaton had the good sense to move on before the inevitable: WB going sequel crazy.  In the third movie, Val Kilmer almost pulled it off; the inclusion of the Robin storyline actually worked.  Director Joel Schumaker turned the Gotham into a black-light world of flourescent paint and was immensely heavy handed in constantly tilting the camera back and forth.  Seldom was there a nice, level camera scene.  The sucker was saved by the one-two punch of Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones (who replaced Billy Dee Williams, sadly) almost as over the top as Carrey in playing Two-Face.<br /><br />Even then WB couldn't let it go - exit Schumaker (and the need to take Dramamine to combat motion sickness) and Kilmer.  Enter George Clooney, who had the looks for the part, but didn't make it work at all.  It might have to do with his recent response to a question if he would ever play a gay character; he responded that he already had when he played Batman.  Suddenly the movie made more sense, particularly with those damned nipples and 'who gets the larger codpiece' argument on the costumes.  Uma Thurman gives a simply horrible performance and Ah-nold the now girlie-man governor was beyond horrific.  Thus was the death of the Batman series.<br /><br />Then along comes Chris Nolan, et al.  The first thing he did was, as Christian Bale thanked him for upon receiving an MTV award, 'got rid of those bloody nipples'.  Amen, brother.  Rather than try to fix that which was badly broken, Nolan decided to explore Bruce Wayne's journey to become Batman.  By default you also get to see Jim Gordon's journey from an actual uncorrupt cop, helpless to do anything about a system that was essentially owned on all levels by crime.<br /><br />Christian Bale has been an absolute chamelion since being discovered as a child by Spielberg during a miniseries about Anastasia, in which (looking like Alexei's reincarnated doppelganger) he made the miniscule role of the doomed Tsarovich more memorable than the rest of the four hour monstrosity.  Spielberg then cast him as the lead in the huge and harsh world of Empire of the Sun.  Since then Bale has been in so many movies that to list them here would take forever.  He has learned how to sing and dance, all types of accents, been everything from an innocent child to a literal pschopath, and sculpted his own body to fit whatever role he is playing.  In this instance he was coming off of playing a role where he dropped to 140 lbs. for the dark, psychological \\"The Machinist\\".  He then bulked up to 220 lbs, working out, to the point when he showed up for the martial art training he was actually too big.  So he lost weight and re-sculpted his body to the shape they wanted him to be in.  Even during interviews on the extras disk, as well as when he was doing the publicity tour for the film; he speaks with the American accent, not wanting his British accent to sideline people's focus on the fact that he, unlike his character, is not American.  Dedication doesn't even begin to describe Christian Bale.<br /><br />The same could be said for Gary Oldman, also a chamelion of an actor.  He IS Jim Gordon.  Never once do you think of the various villains and other odd characters he has played during his career.<br /><br />Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman perfectly round out both Bruce Wayne and Batman's inner circle of supporters. Caine perfectly played both the paternal role as well as the keeper of the Wayne family's legacy and honor.  You will find yourself saying, \\"Nevah,\\" with utter conviction in your own life.  Freeman's character is brilliant, hidden in the bowels of the Wayne building with scientific and just plain cool items that would be wonderful to make use of in Iraq right now.  As Freeman's character notes, however, the military doesn't think that a $300,000 body army suit is worth protecting their soldiers with, so even if the various military prototypes were not fictional - you know that they would be shoved in a drawer waiting for Bruce to 'borrow'.  Most well-played was Freeman and Bale's unspoken acknowledgment of what Bruce is doing, even as he aids him under the guise of cave diving and base jumping.<br /><br />WB and fans no doubt want sequels, and there are already things set up for the next film; nonetheless you wonder if it should stand alone rather than trying to make it into another franchise that will eventually be mishandled.<br /><br />My only complaints are that there is no commentary and the extras disc is out and out annoying in its cutesy attempt to use a small comic strip as a way to find 'Easter Eggs', i.e. all the extra features.  Just list the damned documentaries.  Katie Holmes did a good enough, albeit annoyingly self-righteous, character.  You can't help watching her and thinking, \\"Yep, that's probably the last movie she'll be doing now that she's been sucked into Scientology as a breeder for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />I'd actually give the movie 4 1/2 stars for the above reasons, as well as a few logistical issues.  Most people wouldn't notice them, so it likely won't matter.  All in all the movie is brilliant in its story, the acting, and the return to classic scenes of the stoic Batman perched like a gargoyle on various older buildings, watching silently over Gotham.w.

0007144350|4.0|I had purchased this complete works of Oscar Wilde since I'd seen several of the recent releases of the theatrical versions of his plays and wanted to know more.  As far as one volume complete works go, this has the usual weight (but not to heavy), small print (but not microscopic), and thin paper.  It does have intros by Wilde's son and grandson which are interesting.  Not having read much of Wilde it's been great being able to read not only his famous works (The Importance of Being Ernest, the Canterville Ghost) but also his lesser known ones (Lady Windemere's Fan).  His plays are witty and often make interesting observations on human interactions, but they start seeming redundant after you've read more than three (every one seems to include a debonair, worldly cynic who offers his insights on the world--the characters played by Rupert Everett if he performs Wilde).  I've yet to finish all the works but I look forward to attempting to do so. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to new Wilde fans, literature majors, etc.  For those just looking to read one or two of his works this would not be the way to start.

B0000013GT|5.0|This album is so great.  I'm talking from \\"You May Die (Intro)\\" to \\"Elevators\\", I felt that I was listening to one of the greatest hiphop albums ever made, especially now with hiphop being so dull, boring and too \\"been there, done that\\" for people like me.  And, while I'm here, I might as well give props to one of the greatest hiphop songs ever made, \\"E.T. (Extraterrestrial)\\".  A lot of people overlook this song cuz it has no drum beat.  That's the beauty of it.  It forces you to pay more attention to the lyrics.  And, for me, Dre puts out one of the illest verses that has ever been crafted or will ever be crafted.  And, the melody here is totally on some  otherworldly, out of this world type ish.  It has to be one of the illest hiphop songs ever made!  Still, this is one of the greatest hiphop albums ever made, and dagnabbit, this is one of the greatest albums ever made, period!!!

006097625X|5.0|Mc Cloud writes and draws in such a logical, straightforward style that remains funny and entertaining. His research and organization show this to be a heavy book disguised as fluff. (not to say that all comics are shallow, but they usually do not give the first impression of \\"War and Peace\\"). I was visiting my daughter at school and saw this softcover laying on the coffee table. I thought it might be a counter- culture \\"People\\" magazine. I was sucked in to the light approach and funny quirks in animation. Soon I realized this was a serious topic and also impossible to put down. I had to have a copy of my own.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|The vocals, harmonies, lyric, melodies--all are outstanding.  Admittedly I'm a huge Knopfler fan, but this pairing with Emmylou Harris is perfect--the songs speak to us while they sing to each other. <br />I'd fly anywhere to hear them live (& I tried to but weather delays canceled our flight to NYC from Cleveland--just one night in NYC would have been worth it)--the musical styles are all American--country, pop, rock, and more... <br />This music is for those listeners who want to hear significant meaning in some lyrics, while really enjoying the humor in others.  The guitar work is terrific, as always.  I believe Knopfler is the greatest performing guitarist out there (EC is lazy, everyone else is dead) and his vocal range and style is uniquely grown up. <br />I've highly commended this album to all my friends. <br />Sam in Cleveland
0553212478|4.0|It seems to me that Mary Shelley's famous novel gets more relevant and more important as time goes on. As the original tale about how mankind's creations can get dangerously out of hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is known the world over, though interestingly (as is often the case with famous novels) the basic concept has been reshaped and re-imagined so many times that the source material becomes somewhat ignored. Like J. M. Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" (which isn't actually a children's story) and Charles Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist\\" (which isn't really about Oliver Twist), thousands of people proclaim that they know the story well of Frankenstein well - and yet on reading the actual text they discover that it is radically different from their preconceptions of it.<br /><br />Thus one of the most interesting things about reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is in realising just how many misconceptions surround the original story. For example, few realise that the name Frankenstein is not the name of the monster at all (who remains nameless throughout); but rather the doctor who created him. Likewise, the monster is not brought to life in the midst of a lightening storm, at no point is the doctor assisted by a deformed hunchback and never does he cry the words: \\"It's alive! It's alive!\\" More remarkably, our notion of Frankenstein's monster as a hulking, lumbering monster of a man is completely at odds with Shelley's description of him as a quick and agile wraith of a figure. Thanks Hollywood.<br /><br />It is an ideal illustration of how the surrounding mythology of a concept can warp the true content of a classic story. If you have seen any of the famous movies (whether the old black-and-white films or modern retellings such as the latest Kenneth Branagh version or [groan] Stephen Sommers' \\"Van Helsing\\") or laughed at one of the thousands of \\"Frankenstein\\" references that permeate our culture, or read similar stories that are based on the \\"Frankenstein\\" conceit of man's creation escaping his control, then do yourself a favour, make yourself a little smarter, and read the real McCoy: Mary Shelley's original story.<br /><br />During a holiday in 1816, Mary Shelley and her group of friends were each challenged to write a ghost-story (by none other than Lord Byron himself). Drawing inspiration from a nightmare and encouraged by her husband who saw potential in the unfolding tale, Shelley began to work diligently on what would become literary history. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a surprisingly slim novel that begins with letters from young explorer Robert Walton to his sister, describing his voyage into the Artic and the unexpected rescue of a near-dead man out of the icy sea. Walton recounts the circumstances surrounding the man's condition and rescue, and proceeds to record the strange tale that Doctor Victor Frankenstein tells him. Doctor Frankenstein once had it all; an illustrious career, a loving family and a wealthy home - all of which he threw away in the pursuit of knowledge and power.<br /><br />After discovering the secret of how to bring to life inanimate matter, Frankenstein is horrified by his own success when a living being emerges from his laboratory. Shunning the poor creature, it bounds away into the wilderness where the continual loathing and hatred that the human race expresses toward it turns its innocence into madness. After Frankenstein denies it a female partner with which to life out its life, the monster turns to cruel revenge and systematically begins to destroy all that Frankenstein loves. Now the two of them, creator and creation, have fled to the Artic wastelands to finally put an end to one another's misery.<br /><br />The book fits the genre of \\"Gothic\\" like a glove, with all the trademarks and pitfalls of what one expects from such novels. \\"Frankenstein\\" is not without its flaws, with character motivation and sensibility being skewered in order to serve the plot. For example, Frankenstein's refusal to act against his creation (especially when innocent lives are at stake) is frustrating to the point of being despicable, and the monster's acquiring of language and general knowledge simply through watching a family is a stretch of credibility to say the least - yet both these things must occur if the story is to be pushed in the direction Shelley wants it. She will often gloss over elements that are not important to the development of the plot, and as such I could not help but smile when Shelley avoids the question of how precisely Frankenstein managed to create life by having him proclaim that the information is too dangerous for him to share.<br /><br />But such moments are easy to accept considering the time period, the genre and the dense atmospheric horror that Shelley embodies in her work. \\"Frankenstein\\" is an immensely rewarding read that is necessary for anyone who claims to known and like the Frankenstein mythos. And in these days of cloning, stem-cell research and genetic manipulation, Shelley's cautionary tale about the dangers of playing God and meddling with life is more crucial than ever.creation (especially when innocent lives are at stake) is frustrating to the point of being despicable, and the monster's acquiring of language and general knowledge simply through watching a family is a stretch of credibility to say the least - yet both these things must occur if the story is to be pushed in the direction Shelley wants it.

0312330537|5.0|This book did what no other book about India has ever done for me. It was able to take me there once again. I lived in India for about a year in the early 1970's and have never gotten over or forgotten my experiences in that wonderful and fascinating country. This book brought it all back. It was almost to much. I would have to put it down because of sensory overload. At the same time I wanted it to go on forever. <br /> <br />I have been searching for a book such as this one for over 30 years since my return.

B000000OAA|4.0|As an overall album, it has the most consistent feel of the Queen productions to which I've listened, possibly because most of the tracks don't reflect each other stylistically at all.<br /><br />  This probably was the peak of Freddie's voice before he began shredding it with screechy rock noises (which were appropriate when employed, but still bad for one's voice).  His clean, sustained tone is most evident in \\"Lily of the Valley.\\"<br /><br />  I swear I've heard the melody of \\"Dear Friends\\" before.  It sounds like an arranged hymn or something, or maybe my brain is making stuff up.  Still....
B00000I07P|4.0|This 3rd record has always been one of Bon Jovi's most popular, and it is easy to understand why. While it doesn't quite have the same force and impact of his 2nd record ('7800'), it still maintains a formidable punch. Undoubtedly, another reason this record became so popular was that it did a rare thing. It contained a number of commercial songs that did not seem to display a compromised effort on Bon Jovi's part. (There are exceptions to every rule, and this 3rd record, even though commercial, IS one of Bon Jovi's best.) 'Let It Rock' is a good opener to the record. 'You Give Love A Bad Name' was to become a major hit, and it does have a real 80s punch to it; 'Living On a Prayer' is an uplifting song; 'Social Disease' is arguably the greatest song on the record; 'Dead Or Alive' was yet another hit that cleverly inserts some classical sounds into this 80s icon. 'Raise Your Hands' is yet another 80s sounding song that is uplifting; 'Without Love' is a bit softer than most of the other songs, but it is still done well; 'I'd Die For You' may sound a bit clicheish, but as he often does, Bon Jovi rescues the worn thin material with some of his touches; the same can be said for 'Never Say Goodbye.' 'Wild In the Streets' again displays Bon Jovi's abilities. He ends the record in an uplifting song that doesn't inspire hatred or anger. I'm guessing this 3rd record of Bon Jovi's became more popular than his powerful '7800' because this 3rd record is more uplifting and hopeful. Along with his '7800' and 'New Jersey' this record is a MUST have.
B00008438V|5.0|this movie is great we loved it in the 80s when we first rented it and still got a big laugh out of it now
B000001FP8|5.0|As an English major, I often had to read and write papers on books that I didn't personally like, but I had to admit they were excellent books. While '7800' remains unchallenged as my favorite Bon Jovi record, I have to admit that this 4th record 'New Jersey' is a 5 star record. If you're expecting the same power and intensity of '7800' or even 'Slippery When Wet,' BEWARE. This record takes a different turn. The 1st half is still rock, but it is a softer rock. 'Lay Your Hands on Me' is a nice opener that paves the way for this 4th record's different tone. 'Bad Medicine' is a catchy tone and became a hit; 'Born To Be My Baby,' 'Living In Sin,' and 'Blood On Blood' consistently maintain the different, but still well done tone of this record. The 2nd half of the record takes a country rock turn. 'HomeBound Train' shows that Bon Jovi can make changes of directions exciting; 'Wild Is the Wind' skillfully combines sadness and an energetic tone; 'Ride Cowboy Ride' is a short song, but somehow we get the impression that it belongs despite its brief time; 'Stick to your Guns' and 'I'll Be There For You' prove that Bon Jovi CAN sing, and unlike many others, he does NOT need to hide behind excess noise or obscenities for that matter. '99 In the Shade' is the ONE song on this record that resembles (in any way) the tracks on 'Slippery When Wet.' (Perhaps Bon Jovi felt obligated to give us one 'Slippery When Wet' type song.) 'Love For Sale' was recorded after they were exhausted from a party, but this adds a human touch and makes it (at least in my opinion) better. Again, this is one of Bon Jovi's best records, but you have to understand that it is different from his previous records. When I listen to this record, I almost always get the impression that this is Bon Jovi's favorite child. Obviously I don't know for sure, but perhaps it could be because it is different, but still very good.

B000002UYZ|5.0|I can't say anything about the music that's already been said - so let's just focus on the collection itself. It's as close as there will ever be to a definitive but small collection of the first half of the band's run. Every song on here is a radio staple. This is a really valuable collection, although I can admit it's not a value in itself. I don't understand why EMI has to be so crazy with these albums - they'll make a much bigger profit if they take even a small amount off normal prices.  <br /> <br />The tag \\"digitally remastered\\" means that the songs were taken from the digital masters made sometime in the 80s and not from the analog tapes made in the 60s. Some people take this as a major sound quality improvement. The quality here is somewhat better than on the back catalogue CDs released a few years before this but it's not drastic at all.  <br /> <br />Anyone who doesn't have these songs needs to look no further than here. 1967-1970 is a good investment as well, aside from also not being a value at such a price tag.
B000AQBA1W|3.0|I didn't even know the Corrs had come out with a new album, and when I saw the cover featured at Barnes & Noble, I immediately paid full price for it with great eagerness.  I popped in the CD and waited for the fun, bouncy Corrs that I love.  If this sounds like you, then be warned... this is not the album for you. <br /> <br />It's clear they are very proud of this album and it's very dear to their hearts.  And there are things about this album that I really like (especially the 2-3 instrumental songs).  They generously use Sharon's violin to infuse the music with a Celtic sound.  I must say that the tunes are lovely and so is Andrea's voice, and I love that they went back to their roots.  But overall, the music is very depressing and sad.  The one song that isn't (I think it's the 9th one on the album) is, in my opinion, a mediocre upbeat Corrs song... how many times do we have to hear the same lyrics (\\"the boy is breaking up\\") over and over again? <br /> <br />I guess I'll have to keep waiting for that next Corrs album.  I hope it's more of the fun, bouncy tunes like on \\"In Blue\\" because I don't think \\"Home\\" is an album to listen to in the car or on the iPod for upbeat listening. <br /> <br />I hate not leaving a 5 star review for the Corrs, because I absolutely love them.
0517548232|5.0|Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That's the essence of Economics: \\"looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy.\\"     Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.    Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.    As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do. BTW, \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" might be a good place to start...
0345452577|1.0|Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and \\"traveling and learning\\" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city.

I was 14 at the time this came out and living in London's west end, and the music fit perfectly at that time.  Some songs now are a bit aged, and some are just not that good, but as a whole, I think this record set showcases a band taking a different direction and it is one I will keep in my collection.

The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.<br /><br />To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful \\"Fool on the Hill,\\" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's \\"I am the Walrus\\" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  \\"Flying\\" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" and \\"Honey Pie\\".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, \\"Blue Jay Way\\".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.<br /><br />The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  \\"Hello/Goodbye\\" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  \\"All You Need Is Love\\" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  \\"Baby You're a Rich Man,\\" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.<br /><br />Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.econd half almost needs no elaboration.  \\"Hello/Goodbye\\" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.

B000AP2ZLC|5.0|I have not heard any other Cryptopsy albums.  I don't have any idea what the other bands  you guys (and gals) are comparing them with sound like.  I dont listen to any metal outside of COC and Slayer's early stuff.  I mostly dig on old school punk/hardcore.......Septic Death, Rudimentary Peni, tons of U.S. and other hardcore etc, etc.   <br /> <br />Heard a song in a friends car and I bought this the next day.   <br />This stuff blows me away. Ultra fast drumming, crazy riffing, insane  vocalist,  there isnt much missing here.  Well, maybe the bass could have been turned up a bit in the mix.  Other than that this is a winner right out of the gate.  Full marks.
B00005HYHG|4.0|Between March 1962 and Jube 1965, the Beatles were featured performers in fifty-two BBC radio programmes and sang eighty-eight different songs, thirty-six of which they never recorded for a record. The reason that they made so many \\"live\\" appearances on radio is, the Musicians Union had a deal with the BBC, so that a certain percentage of airtime each day had to feature live musicians. In other words, they couldn't just play records all day. This collection features 56 songs that the Beatles recorded especially for radio, including 29 songs they never commercially recorded. There are also a few bits of chat between the Beatles and the radio hosts. But the highlights, of course, are the otherwise unrecorded songs. Almost all of these songs are covers of other artists' songs, although there is one Lennon-McCartney original. The most covered performers are Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Little Richard. They also cover other legends like the Coasters and Buddy Holly, plus some very obscure artists that you probably never heard of. The BBC didn't save many of these shows, so some of the songs are taken from home recordings that people made off of their radios. Consequently, the sound is a bit sketchy on some of the songs. Regardless of that, this is an essential collection for any Beatlemaniac.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I cannot recall ever having seen a television programme that consistantly touched me in every episode.  There is not one single episode that even remotely falters from the premise of the continuing story line.  I laughed, cryed, and truly cared about the characters.  In an age where most shows have uneven writing or poor plots, this one shines and I highly recommend this disc set.  I just wish they would come out with the following seasons at some point.

B000002UB6|4.0|'Let It Be' is easily the most disappointing Beatles album.   It's not simply that it is uneven and less professional, it is also inevitable with the matchless achievements of all their previous work, comparisons would render this album a failure.  Significantly, this album sadly was strategically put on the shelf for a year and became their last release once it had become acceptable enough for them.  Also, it is no small matter that this is their only studio album to change hands from their able producer George Martin.  Perhaps giving nod to their sentimental favorite works, Phil Spector takes the helm.  The inconsistencies aren't all his fault, and some of the successes are partly his as well.    \\"Two of Us\\" is an engaging and humble start.  With spare acoustic guitar and a heart-warming interplay of vocals by John and Paul, we get an intimate Beatles' song like nowhere else.  Later, this fine duo collaboration continues on the passionate \\"I've Got a Feeling\\".   Then, there are some stunning achievements as well.  \\"Let It Be\\" is still remarkable for its layered interplay of organ, guitar, and percussion sung with passion and tenderness by Paul.   His lyrics make for a classic, inspiring anthem.  The album is also indispensible for the galloping rocker \\"Get Back\\" with its muscular guitar and funny lyrics.  Perhaps controversy was understandable for the beautiful \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" a remarkable song, drawing from Ray Charles, even if it was arguably overproduced.  There are other laudable efforts, including, Lennon's pensive \\"Across the Universe\\" and his funny ditty, \\"Maggie Mae\\".  The rest, however, is less than we'd expect from the most celebrated rock band ever.  George delivers a mixed bag on this effort.  \\"For You Blue\\" is a good rocker, but, while \\"I Me Mine\\" delivers a good sermon, it is also a sub-par song.  On every album the Beatles took a different theme or musical approach.  On 'Let It Be' they acquire Billy Preston on keyboards, which broadensthe appeal of the album.  However, on the vintage \\"One After 909,\\" which they wrote in their early years, his able musical talent could have been left out on this song.  Done with guitars in the forefront, it could have been a great rocker.  Also, \\"Dig It,\\" a Lennon contribution, is sincere, but lyrically seems like mere ranting.  Similarly, \\"Dig a Pony\\" is passionate, but substandard to Lennon's other contributions.      Overall, 'Let It Be' is still a worthy musical experience.  It is uneven and less eventful than their other works and a sad way to end the group.  It is also marred by producer personnel changes and probably the group's breakdown.  Nevertheless, it is an admirable attempt to \\"get back\\" to their roots and make a studio album like it was done live.  Significantly, this work would have been regarded as an excellent album by any lesser band.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Roaring, triumphant, stirring visual poetry - this is \\"Superman Returns,\\" a stunning piece of pop art celebrating a comic book superhero as more than a psychological headcase - although there's some of that in Bryan Singer's film - but as an icon that bridges the gap between, yes, Earth and the universe - the mystery that surrounds its vastness and God. Yes, it's underwritten - loose ends dangle about. And it's not very funny. And it's not \\"action-packed.\\" And aside from Kevin Spacey's work as Lex Luthor, the performances are more about the look of the actor than the acting itself.  <br /> <br />But so were many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, when the director communicated a narrative beyond the script, marrying film, sound, music and editing into mesmerizing sequences that simply held you, alert and aware of the scene's resonance and singularity - it was like so much, and yet nothing like those things. It's exuberant and risky to compare Singer to that standard - his \\"X-Men\\" pictures were competent, nothing more - but the last hour of this film reaches for that titanic light and grasps it with a somber, beautiful tone that seeks to comment on nothing less than the fate of our souls. <br /> <br />Using same credit titles from the original \\"Superman\\" and \\"Superman II,\\" \\"Superman Returns\\" begins with the destruction of the planet Krypton, which Superman (Brandon Routh) despite knowing its fate, seeks out anyway, leaving Earth for five years to find it \\"a graveyard\\" and returning to more or less resume duties - and a relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). But Lois has moved on to a decent boyfriend (James Marsden, again the other man) and a son (Tristan Lake Leabu), of whom, it is now known, is the son of Superman.  <br /> <br />The early acts of the screenplay by Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty concern themselves more with Luthor's plan to reconfigure Earth with Krypton crystals, which he finds can create new (if pretty uninhabitable) landmasses for his control. Spacey has reworked Luthor as a soulless, humorless but convincing demon who picks at the flaws of Superman while erecting a hell on Earth over which he can reign. His moll, Kitty (Parker Posey) is a mouthy dim bulb and his collected henchmen are, thankfully, more fearsome than idiotic. One experiment with the crystals causes an accident aboard an Airbus jet that Lois is on, and Superman's \\"return\\" is to save it and, in the process see Lois again. <br /> <br />Routh is no Olivier, or even Christopher Reeve, but then Singer's doesn't require it; in fact, needs Routh to be just what he is. Superman is upright and quiet, burdened by human psychosis but not racked with it himself, content to let his deeds and warmth speak on their own. He makes an effort to woo to Lois away from her boyfriend, but it is not a fierce one. Bosworth makes a cute, likable Lois, smart and insecure, a trembler who marches forth anyway, and is drawn to Superman's certitude. She won a Pulitzer for writing an editorial about \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman,\\" which of course is a substitute for a father, or God, or absolute authority. Superman really stands in as an angel sent by father Jor-El (Marlon Brando, in voiceovers from the original \\"Superman\\") to save \\"a good people, who wish to do well.\\" An angel who complicates his existence by loving one of them.  <br /> <br />And we are them. Through Lois, and her boyfriend, Singer charts our relationship with the myth. Through Luthor, he presents an eloquent, brutal argument - just look what \\"goodness\\" Superman's home material will bring us. \\"God is a selfish being who share his powers,\\" he says, prior to harnessing some of that power. Superman's rebuttal is a straight shot beyond Earth, to lend an ear to all the aggrieved who cry out, or to draw radiance from a blazing sun above the clouds. Singer presents these uncomplicated, pristine, wonderfully framed scenes at the right moments, capturing, in a blink, the relationship of a blessed son with his father, that son with the world, the son with himself. Better, at this stage in our cinematic capabilities, that the film doesn't bog itself down in the lengthy discourse required to explain Superman's pose to the world. More pointed and visually impacting to simply show it. Recalling \\"Batman Begins,\\" the most memorable shot is that of Christian Bale, perched on a skyscraper at dusk, a sentry over the city. \\"Superman Returns\\" is full of that wonder, culminating in an extraordinary sequence that finds the Man of Steel saving the planet and falling back to it at an incalculable speed, rustling the trees of their mist upon his landing. <br /> <br />Singer and cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel wisely forge these visuals with a darker palette borne out of the deep blues and pitch blacks of outer space. The final act of \\"Superman Returns\\" is set against an ocean storm and gray, monolithic structure that recalls the undersea Manhattan of Steven Spielberg's \\"Artificial Intelligence.\\" Otherwise, Metropolis glistens, and the Daily Planet seems to exist in a perpetual golden dust, Singer borrowing Kubrick's technique to airbrush the light into a furry haze, especially around Bosworth. The production and costume design is classic, snazzy and retro. The movie resonates with the mood of an earlier, innocent era, despite the stakes at hand. The look is warm and rapturous.  <br /> <br />It cuts a path that will stupefy some moviegoers, who will find it dry, save Spacey's performance as Luthor. A hardening of the culture, and a lack of intangible curiosity, will bring them to their boredom, so accustomed they've become to the overliterate and brainy scripts of recent superhero movies. \\"Superman Returns\\" has a deep subtext - spiritual, in fact - but it's a visual one; the screenplay is enough of a foundation to support the images, but Singer does not endeavor to mire his picture down in a pop culture sludge that makes it tastier.  <br /> <br />The result is action cinema of high order. It can be chilling - a piano duet between the boy and one of Luthor's henchmen. Or tragic - a severe beating of Superman on the krypton island. Or, in the climax, extraordinary. But so many of the scenes have the whisper of deep care behind them, of exquisite construction, of the hush of a late evening across the world. \\"Superman Returns\\" is a mournful, moody, wonderful thing. Its calm is rousing, and its universal perspective wise. Some myth all right.  <br />

B00001OH7Y|5.0|This album is an absolutly brilliant album, however as with most things brilliance is relative. All though far more people fell in love with this album than probably even Bowie himself expected the truth is this album was never met for mass consumption on any real level. Just because there is a reference to major Tom doesn't mean that this album was a return to the pop music Bowie produced in the early 70's. This is album is when Bowie finaly became comfortable with his past drug addiction. It is Bowie happy being Bowie all though it would not last through the '80s. If you are a hardcore Bowie fan and enjoy albums That have greater focus on the big picture than on the individual songs pick this up I promise you will not be disapointed. If not then simply pop in Ziggy Stardust again and enjoy there's something for everyone where Bowie's involved.
630460291X|2.0|An ok on a rainy day movie, and granted this is a different type of adaptation than it's predecessor,but Costner can never compare to the wonderful talent and the exceedingly good looks of Errol Flynn. I own Flynn's and I watch it over and over again. I could not do that with this one. Breaks my heart that Flynn will never get an Oscar for his ability, and some of the present day actors could not compare to him and they still rake them in. Costner is a talented actor, but no comparison. Watching this adaptation, I missed the wit and charm of the heartbreaking Robin Hood that Mr Errol Flynn portrayed. We miss you Errol.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|'Beatles 1' remarkably is the first Beatles' album to be the #1 bestseller of any given year.  (While nearly all of their studio albums went to the top of the charts, none of them was the top seller of any given year.  'Hello, Dolly,' I believe beat out 'Meet the Beatles,' in 1964, for instance.)  For those who are familiar with the blue and red albums, this collection has many advantages.  While it is not as smoothly integrated as the other mentioned collections, it is easier to digest the scope of their career in one sitting.  The breadth of their growth and maturity is documented well, and it helps collectors to avoid redundancy.  Mostly, there are singles that weren't taken from albums, and, when they were released from albums, only a few are represented.  One can still buy 'A Hard Day's Night,' 'The Beatles for Sale,' and 'Revolver,' and still have new territory to cover.    Some of the best pop singles ever are represented here.  How could one go without double-A sided classics, like \\"Day Tripper\\"/\\"We Can Work It Out,\\" or \\"Something\\"/\\"Come Together\\"?  Then, there are the classics songs \\"I Feel Fine,\\" \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\".  Still, as well presented as this straightforward collection is, there are some serious omissions.  Why is \\"Please Please Me,\\" a #1 on both sides of the Atlantic, and their first #1 ever not included?  Or for that matter, \\"Michelle\\" would have been a good soft song to add to the mix.  I can understand why \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" was omitted.  It is a good cover, but the rest of the songs were written by the Beatles, and this version, sung by George, was only released in America, where it became a #1. (Thirty #1's would make a nice, round number, though.)      Despite the criticisms, 'Beatles 1' is a fine document of their success, a good sampler, and a good listen.  It makes a terrific addition to any c.d. collection.

0517220784|5.0|Containing 56 short stories and 4 full-length novels, _The Complete Sherlock Holmes_ is thick.  But it is well worth the reading.  Beginning with \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" and concluding with \\"The Final Problem\\", the short stories were what drew my closest attention.  (The novel \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a treat as well.)<br /><br />One immediately understands why Doyle's characters have endured so long - the characters are brilliantly written, the methods of solving the cases vary, and the variety of cases themselves run the gamut from international conspiracies, (\\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" is a personal favorite) to missing persons, (I recommend \\"The Greek Interpreter\\") to lost objects and murder.  The brilliance of Doyle's writing is further underscored by the manner in which the cases are resolved - not every criminal goes to prison, and in some instances the mystery / crime is not what readers are initially led to believe.  Read them piecemeal or as a whole, you will be equally rewarded with tales that are simply fun and entertaining.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer remarked, the typeface is a bit small, which can be a strain - especially considering the engrossing nature of the stories.  Nonetheless they are remarkably entertaining.  Highly recommended.
B00001QGPR|5.0|First things first there is no point in comparing this to any of Bowie's other works. As every good Bowie fan Knows there are at least six different periods of Bowie's music. '60s folk, pre-Ziggy, Ziggy, post-Ziggy, 80's dance music, and of course his current incarnation which is quite simply one experiment after another. 'hours is quite frankly one of the crowning achievements of this era. With it's soft melodies as well as it's very personal lyrics the album is not nearly as harsh as either 1.Outside or Earthling nor as tripy as Heathen however every bit as much a cornerstone of his current body of work. Bottom line this is an absolutley wonderful album in it's own light and comparing to any other period of Bowie will only degrade the meaning of both pieces as they both were made with an entirely different result in mind. This is simply the music Bowie wants to make. It's an experiment and quite frankly a very sucessful one.

B00005JP0A|2.0|I can live with the fact that the film version of Lauren Weisberger's THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, is a shell of the novel.  Other than the basic story, the main characters and all of $pectacular couture, virtually nothing about this film was mentioned in the book.<br /><br />I understand that some of this has to do with the fact that neither the film makers nor the actors involved wanted to skewer Vogue magazine's Anna Wintour as much as her former whiny assistant did in her debut novel. But I cannot understand why this film was so relentlessly boring.<br /><br />In a nutshell THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is the story of Northwestern grad, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathway) and her first post college job as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the snippy editrix of Runway, a montly fashion magazine that is blantantly based on Vogue.<br /><br />While the book's plot was scooped out and replaced by a completely different story, some of the performances here were good.  Best of all is Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, Runway's second in command, who takes it upon himself to assasinate Andrea's wardrobe, figure and personality before helping to reinvent her as a major fashionista.  Also very funny is Meryl Streep, who surprise, surprise takes the ball and runs with it and proves to be a great comedic actress.  Some will also recognize Gieslle Bundchen, the reigning queen of the catwalk in real life, who here plays the minor role of a friend of Miranda's first assistant.<br /><br />Because the story itself is so boring, one is left in the theater to admire the real star of this film: Patricia Field, the stylist and designer who worked on Sex and the City and who here is responsible for making the film at least visually interesting.<br /><br />- Regina McMenamin
B000001ZS3|5.0|My first exposure to this 1976 album took place in 1985 while in college.  As somebody who lived on a steady diet of Yes, Pink Floyd, and Tangerine Dream in high school, I was (at the time) surprised that I had never heard of French electronic composer Jean Michel Jarre.  At any rate, discovering this album was a moment that I will forever cherish and it is now an integral part of my electronic collection along with the follow-up album Equinoxe (1978).<br /><br />Stylistically, this music is closest to the \\"Berlin School\\" approach to electronic music (e.g. Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze) especially the mid-1970s work of Tangerine Dream, although an admixture of the styles of electronic composers that are closer to progressive rock (e.g. Synergy, Kitaro, Tomita, and Vangelis) is present too.  I should note however that the music on Oxygene is not as intense as the music written by any of those other composers and as such is a lot more \\"listener friendly\\" and inviting.<br /><br />The six part Oxygene suite includes sections (or movements if you will) that range in length from 3'24\\" to 10'26\\".  The movements are mostly brooding and synth heavy, with the occasional \\"computerized\\" rhythm provided by what is referred to in the liner notes as a \\"Rhythmin' computer\\".  Other instruments used by Jean Michel on Oxygene include the ARP synthesizer (possibly an ARP string ensemble), AKS synthesizer, VCS3, RMI Harmonic synthesizer, Farfisa organ, the Eminent, and the mellotron.  Together, these instruments are used to create ever-changing and spacey soundscapes that fizzle, bubble, pulse, and brood.  He has a good sense of melody and there is certainly no shortage of them on this album.  When the melodies are coupled with the wide range in dynamics and timbres, it makes for a very interesting listening experience.  On top of it all is his trademark phasing, which makes everything sound just that much more...cosmic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a classic of electronic music and is very highly recommended along with Equinoxe.ended along with Equinoxe.

B000FGGE68|2.0|This movie was a low-budget, Matrix-wannabe from a writer/director, Kurt Wimmer, who obviously has anti-Christian sentiments.  I rented this movie hoping to find great action, special effects, and story line close to the excellence of the Matrix.  Well, I guess 1 out of three is bad, but the main problem I had besides the bad story line and weak action was the anti-Christian rhetoric.  Don't get me wrong. There were some very good special effects scenes in this movie, such as the guns and bullets that seemed to come out of UV's hands. And riding motorcycles along the sides of buildings is indeed wild.  But all of this cannot make up for a weak plot and some lackluster acting.    Besides the fact that we have Christian cross symbols practically all over the place within the \\"oppressive\\" and \\"evil\\" empire that UV tears down in her battles, comments are made in the movie which also show the anti-Christian bias of Wimmer.      And of course you can't forget that last scene where we pull towards (and back) from the control center of the \\"evil\\" empire and it just happens to look like the Christian crucifix!  I may be dense sometimes, but if Mr. Wimmer thinks Christians are so stupid that they can't see through that blatant yet thinly disguised attack, perhaps He needs some mental healing from Jesus.    And we can't forget the last lines from the movie during the big fight scene at the end and afterwards, where the \\"evil\\" \\"Vice Cardinal\\" (wow, wonder where that terminology came from) says to UV: \\"Do you believe in God, Violet?  Do you hope He's merciful?  Do you think He'll welcome you into His Arms like the so very many you sent His way?\\"      And of course the anti-Christian ax Mr. Wimmer seems to be grinding in this movie would not be complete without a final stab at Christianity by UV herself: \\"...And my body...will Garth be able to fix it the way another had cured my soul?  Maybe. Maybe not. But this I do know. All those still out there who spread oppression, injustice, and hatred...they better hope not.\\"   And of course we know the old lines from people who feel that Christianity has done nothing but spread oppression, injustice and hatred, ignoring multitudes of historical facts which dismiss such rhetoric.    Hey Mr. Wimmer, here's some advice. Next time try saving some money and time (especially ours) by creating an anti-Christian blog or something where you can overtly vent out your views like a man instead of making underhanded slaps using a movie.  I would have more respect for you if you did that instead of this sham, Matrix imitation that could have been a classic like the Matrix had the writer put away his ax and produced a thoughtful and original product without the anti-Christian agenda.    And of course there will always be those who, not understanding or knowing what Christianity is, will argue that the movie isn't anti-Christian despite the clear evidence of this througout the movie.  Pity. Blind folks usually have trouble seeing better than those with sight.
B00005BIIP|5.0|I recall snapping this 2001 album up upon it's release during a slight lull in the release of \\"official\\" PT studio albums during the 2000 - 2002 timeframe (i.e. from Lightbulb Sun to In Absentia) and the fact that this was a Limited Edition CD (#681 of 20,000) had me pretty excited.  To make the deal even sweeter, I noted that there were a lot of new pieces, including a nearly 14 minute version of Even Less, which first appeared on Stupid Dream (1999), albeit at only slightly over 7 minutes in length.<br /><br />The musicians on this album include Steve Wilson (lead vocals, electric/acoustic guitars, samples, hammered dulcimer, and acoustic piano); Richard Barbieri (Hammond organ, mellotron, and analog synthesizers); Chris Maitland (drums); and Colin Edwin (fretless electric bass and acoustic bass).  Along with the core musicians there is a flute/saxophone player and a string section.  With respect to the core musicians, I enjoy Steve Wilson's excellent vocals although Colin's bass playing is worth singling out - he is a very tasteful and restrained player that never oversteps his bounds, unlike most of the bassists in the new prog bands out there.  Furthermore, as a huge fan of 1970s progressive and experimental rock, I especially appreciate the fact that these guys favor mostly analog equipment.<br /><br />The 60 plus minute mix of pieces on this compilation include three previously unreleased tracks (Buying New Soul (10'24\\"), the expanded version of Even Less, and Oceans Have No Memory), while the remaining tracks were originally released as singles.  The tracks range in length from 3'06\\" to 13'55\\" with most in the 6 minute plus category.  Interestingly enough all of the tracks flow together into one cohesive whole and are well-paced, making this quite possibly the perfect PT album.  Well, that is how I feel about it at any rate.  I guess the plus for me is that with the single exception of the introduction to Access Denied, there is very little of the \\"poppiness\\" that started to creep in on albums like Stupid Dream and with the follow-up Lightbulb Sun (2000).  In short, this is one incredible slab of killer, post-progressive space rock that recalls the best moments on albums like The Sky Moves Sideways and Signify.<br /><br />Speaking of the music, it is very somber and grey with loads of spacey sections dominated by analog synths and heavily echoed guitars.  Everything sounds incredibly organic and the splashes of mellotron here and there really add quite a lot to the brooding feel of the album.  In addition to the spacier sections, there are some slightly heavier moments when the whole band is playing and Steve gets a very crunchy and distorted sound on the electric guitar.  These moments are far and few between however, but add a textural element to the album that is just fantastic.  I should note that the lengthy jam on the 13'55\\" Even Less is awesome and it is too bad that this version was not included on the Stupid Dream album - surely a great album would have been made greater.<br /><br />Not only is this my single favorite album by PT, I feel that it is quite possibly one of their best albums in spite of it being a compilation of unreleased tracks and previously released singles.  In fact, it is unfortunate that this album can not be distributed to a wider audience and is only presently available as an extremely expensive (and out of print) limited edition \\"collector's item\\".  This album is very highly recommended with every fiber of my being to all 1970s prog/experimental rock fans that are desperately looking for newer, yet excellent and interesting music.to creep in on albums like Stupid Dream and with the follow-up Lightbulb Sun (2000).

B00000DFRS|5.0|Whitney Houston does it again!!! This album is amazing and this album is way diffirent then her past albums. Not really any slow love songs but it's ok! This album oddly peaked at #13 on the charts but was certified 4x platinum in the US alone and sold over 13 million worldwide.  <br /> <br />Heartbreak Hotel #2  <br />It's Not Right But It's Ok #4 <br />My Love Is Your Love #4 <br />I Learned From The Best #28 <br /> <br />My favorite track on the album is no other than Heartbreak Hotel. The song is just a great track and I remember when it was outplayed on the radio. Now I wish Whitney would come up with something like this. Make sure you pick up a copy of this album!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Well now this is more like it. I was a little disappointed after hearing mezmerize. Still a great cd but too much daron! We want to hear SOAD not system of a daron some ppl said. Well this album is miles better than mezmerize. Right from the frenetic opener Attack to the closing song Soldier Side, this cd doesnt skip a beat well it does if im jumping around like a mofo but still. Fav songs on the album: Holy Mountains, Kill Rock N Roll and Stealing Society. I love this cd its so great as soon as you hear attack you just gotta listen to the whole thing. <br />Buy it and prey that their next album after their hiatus will be just as good
B00005JLSE|4.0|The movie was fantastic on the big-screen, and the dvd is just as great for the wide-screen.  Totally worth the purchase.
B0009A40ES|5.0|i am sick of reading reviews from people claiming the film was \\"too confusing,\\" and the scenes could have been \\"more violent.\\" don't write a review about a movie that you know nothing about and don't understand. it's a satire, not a horror movie. read bret's books before you start criticizing his filmic adaptations. ellis is one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century.
B000002VMD|4.0|The only reason I purchased this soundtrack back in 1992 was because I was a big Whitney Houston fan. It is worth the purchasee for her tracks that are on here. This is the biggest selling soundtrack ever! It is certified 17 platinum in the US alone and spent 20 weeks at Number #1. It also gave Whitney her biggest hit ever!  <br /> <br />I Will Always Love You #1 (14 weeks)...4 platinum <br />I'm Every Woman #4 Gold <br />I Have Nothing #4  Gold <br />Run To You #31 <br /> <br />Other highlights on this album are Queen Of The Night and Jesus Loves Me. As for the other tracks, they are not so good. Oddly Run To You missed the Top 10. It is my favorite track on the album. Make sure you pick up a copy of this soundtrack. Even though it's just for the Whitney tracks,it will be worth the purchase.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Well this is an awesome album but only if ur in the mood for it not like their others. <br /> <br />Im not gonna bother writing out each song but will say that sad statue prompted me to buy their statue crying t shirt. Also this album is quite diff from their others, cant quite put my finger on it but its there somewhere. BYOB,REVENGA! CIGARO THIS COCAINE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM ON THIS SONG and SAD STATUE are the best songs on this album. BUY IT AND BE AMAZED with the diff sound and the cool but freaky and macarbe artwork.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|I thought that when I first saw underworld that it was very good, but owning it you get to see things you have missed from renting. I love this movie for its thought out plot and amazing effects.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|If you saw the first, then this needs no explanation. No spoilers, both the first film and this latest adaptation make for cult classics.
B0009K7RES|5.0|I begged my sister for this cd for Christmas and it has, quite literally, never left the car since December 25. It has its own place on the passenger seat like a talisman, my own audio good luck charm. In some odd way I don't feel right if I can't look over and see him on the cover, gazing off into space. No Mark Knopfler collection is complete without this, a sort of studio-work-within-a-studio-work. He always manages to put a different spin on every new rendition, a fresh energy, a wry nuance that wasn't there before. I have honestly never really gotten his attachment to \\"Rudiger\\" - one of my least-favourites - but I don't question his inclusion of it here. It certainly connects the old with the new, which perhaps was his intent. I love any variation of \\"Everybody Pays\\" (a sentiment I have always wished I could render so succinctly),and I've come to be very fond of \\"Stand Up Guy\\" and \\"Donegan's Gone\\" (the man wasn't just one of Mark's heroes, Mark eventually got to be friends with Lonnie Donegan, so it makes sense he should include this song - Mark has always given credit where it was due.)I am not ashamed to say I would and will stand by everything I've heard from Mark Knopfler - I fully appreciate the continued excellence of a member of my own generation in a world that increasingly snubs those who have earned better - and having said that, I am glad to have this collection of songs in my library. I wouldn't feel whole without it.<br /><br />i<br /><br />(
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Brought this album in 2004 in Japan when i was there. Very good Cd let me tell you. Tracks 1,2 and 7 are her best songs and shes so hot! Buy this disc if you like your music a little alt rock sometimes. Oh and shes not punk no matter how many times you try and convince me. Still a good album except for \\"He Wasn't\\" Im a guy so i tend to skip over that one coz im not gay. Anyways look out for more reviews soon from me. Peace out everyone!
B000BBYMA2|5.0|What better picture then Battle Royale for my first Amazon review? A class of ninth grade students are thrown on a deserted island and forced into a cruel and gruesome game where friends must kill friends until only one victor remains.  <br /> <br />But lucky for us old faithful Amazon customers this film is a hella of a lot smarter then the premise insists. Cult filmmaker Fukasaku Kinji takes a Verhoevenian approach that blends grizzly over the top violence (in one scene a poor souls severed head is turned into a make shift bomb), with biting social commentary, and dashed with good old-fashioned melodrama.  <br /> <br />Truly solid gold pulp that only Kinji can give justice. So if you are a fan of eastern actioniers, I can promise you that you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />On a side note, the one and only Harry Knowles at Aint it Cool News reported a few weeks back that an American remake has been green lit with the producer of XXX and The Fast and the Furious attached. But as he said, lets hope Larry Clarke or even Paul Verhoeven can get their hands on it.
0060899190|5.0|The one word that comes to mind when looking through this book is a simple \\"wow.\\"  I bought it as a gift for my friend after hearing her mention it, but while it was sitting in my room awaiting her birthday, I couldn't help but pour over it myself.  The range of secrets is staggering--from the lighthearted and funny to the dark and upsetting, and everywhere in between.  I'm only 15, but the raw truth of the secrets is something that I believe everyone could appreciate and reflect on.  I know I certainly did. <br /> <br />As for the book itself, I liked the way that some of the postcards were magnified, because it helped to accentuate the differences among secrets.  Plus, it made the book even more entrancing to look at, as well as more \\"readable\\" if one chose to sit down and just read everything in succession.  That's not the style I would suggest, but it can be done, just because this book is so touching.  <br /> <br />Parents might like to know that some of the secrets were somewhat sexual in nature, and if this disturbs you greatly, this book might not be the best choice.  However, on a whole, I think the book could be a great discussion piece, as well as something that really makes one think, for all.   <br /> <br />When I did have to part with this in order to give it to my friend, she told me afterwards that it was one of the most interesting and creative gifts she'd ever gotten.  She too thought it was wonderful, and you will too.
0743457900|5.0|The first in the Smiley-Karla Trilogy:    1. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy  2. The Honorable Schoolboy  3. Smiley's People    George Smiley, John Le Carre's classic, retired spymaster, has to find the mole in MI6. Karla, his Soviet nemesis, runs this mole and has been embarrassing MI6 at every turn. Smiley is drawn back into the web of the Circus to find the traitor who has betrayed his country and caused the murders of his countrymen.     This book is ultimately about betrayal and the cost of betrayal. Smiley's wife cheats on him and betrays him. Smiley searches for the mole who is betraying his country and his brethren. Ultimately, Smiley must betray the mole. The layers upon layers of betrayal build to a haunting but poeticly just climax.     Le Carre is at his finest when he writes about Cold War spies, probably because, as other reviews note, he was one. When one is in the midst of such a confusing, horrifying situation, one contemplates it deeply. Le Carre's later books, while beautifully written, seem to cast about for an antagonist.     All Le Carre's novels are masterful because he delves so deeply into the human soul and psyche. Though he specifically discusses the British soul and psyche and the spy's soul and psyche, we all have human elements in common, and we are all, to some extent, spies, in that we cannot show our true selves to the world all the time and hope to survive. Reading Le Carre is like taking a clandestine trip down the gullet of someone else's soul.     TK Kenyon  Author of [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1601640226 Callous]]: A Novel
B00005JOX6|3.0|You see the trailer for Click on the tube, and you think comedy all the way. Well, you get that at first. Before he gets the remote, there are lots of laughs, and even more when Chris Walken gives it to him free of charge. This mixed bag ends up being sad, and almost makes you want to cry.<br /><br />I don't want to go in too much detail to ruin the movie for everyone, but it revolves around lost love and death. It is so sad to see what happens to the main characters as Adam Sandler's life gets stuck in fast forward, which shows him a glimpse of the future. The futuristic design of things was surprisingly very convincing.<br /><br />I recommend this movie as a dramedy. It is funny at first, but sad near the end.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I've never followed any medical drama series in the past.  This is actually the first one I've seen and I like it.  I like how there is an equal serving of blood and gore with the humour and the drama.  The extra features doesn'tcarry that much punch but it's decent enough.
B000062YAZ|1.0|i listened to the entire album and it really sounds like garbage, the whole cd sucks, the good thing about this album is the artwork, other than that, my honest opinion is dont buy this. buy some killswitch engage, shadows fall, or six feet under, not this.
1401302378|4.0|I can hardly believe it --- the editor of 'Wired' Magazine has written an entire book about HeadButler.com. Okay, he didn't mention the name, but no matter. Anyone who knows what drives this site understands that HeadButler.com was a \\"Long Tail\\" idea a good many months before Chris Anderson first described the phenomenon in his 'Wired' cover story in the fall of 2004.<br /><br />HeadButler.com and the \\"Long Tail\\" intersect this way: There's no longer any reason to focus on the weekly culture glut of new books, movies and music churned out in massive quantities for mass-market consumption. Let the slick magazines do that if they must. (They don't have to, but that's another subject). The bottom line: Time just isn't a factor here. Thanks to Amazon.com and BN.com and lots of other sites, the old stuff is as readily available as the new stuff. So HeadButler.com's range is huge: every book ever published, every CD ever released, every movie ever slapped on a DVD.<br /><br />Chris Anderson's article about the Long Tail came as a revelation to readers eager for the next big idea. It was the most popular cover story in the magazine's history. Publishers pounced; I think Anderson's book advance was around $700,000. And now we have the book --- an instant best seller, promoted as the next \\"Tipping Point\\" or \\"Blink.\\"<br /><br />Let us pass over the fact that there's really not much more in the book than there was in the article. And that the charts and mathematical discourse are off-putting in the extreme to English majors like me. \\"The Long Tail\\" is a seriously large idea, and much more important than anything Malcolm Gladwell has written.<br /><br />Anderson's starting point is that our culture is \\"a massive popularity\\" contest where \\"hits rule.\\" Or it was. The Internet changed all that. Now consumer choice has expanded geometrically, and, with more to buy, we buy more of everything. This is very good news for writers, musicians and filmmakers usually described as \\"niche.\\"<br /><br />If we think of cultural purchases pictorially --- let's say: as a snake --- a sales chart will reveal a head held high. That's for the \\"hits\\": the popular books, CDs and DVDs that millions buy as soon as they're released. That line falls straight down --- like a debutante's neck --- but just before the bottom it curves and heads straight for the horizon. That's the Long Tail: the expression of consumer purchases of things that would never find shelf space in a superstore. And here's the newsflash: That line never drops and hits zero. There's demand all the way to the end of the tail. Or, to put it correctly, the tail never ends.<br /><br />What this means: \\"Niches are riches.\\" Or: Maybe the way to make decent money is not to chase mega-success but to focus on something small that you love, create a community around it, and make it easy for consumers to get what they want. (This is the relationship HeadButler.com has with you, and with Amazon.com.)<br /><br />Some examples. \\"The Triplets of Belleville\\" --- an animated French film of considerable brilliance --- opened in just six theaters in the United States. Now that it's a DVD on Amazon.com, anyone can see it. In Barnes & Noble superstores, the lowest ranked 1.2 million book titles represent just 1.7% of sales; online, those books are 10% of sales. Songs ranked below 10,000 on Rhapsody are streamed more than the top 10,000. And so on.<br /><br />\\"The Long Tail is about abundance,\\" Anderson writes. That is, it's about endless consumer choice, endless consumer interest and your endless ability to buy what you want. I get the first two. I'm stuck on the third. I recently heard an oil executive suggest that it won't be many years before oil is $150 a barrel. I fear I believed him. Well, in that scenario, if you've just paid $8-a-gallon for gas, I very much doubt you're going to find it absolutely necessary to buy L'Atalante. Or maybe I should look on the bright side. Maybe the likely outcome of $8-a-gallon gas is that you'll only want to consume culture that's rich in protein. This would make 'L'Atalante' a better buy than the new J-Lo. And, not least, it would make \\"filters\\" like HeadButler.com more essential to your cultural consumption.<br /><br />Another topic Anderson doesn't really address: What are the political implications of the Long Tail? Sure, it breaks the monopoly of big media, but even more, it means you can sit on your couch forever. Consume better? I'm with you. Consume more? But then what exactly do you contribute to a world that desperately needs good ideas and hard work?<br /><br />Maybe this is material for another book. Maybe the important thing is that Anderson identified a seismic shift in the marketplace. Lord knows we must all be sick of reading about the Internet as if it's just the \\"blogosphere.\\" And a book like this will surely set the entrepreneurial among you thinking of ideas for Internet businesses. Just don't try to recreate HeadButler, or I'll show you what the end of the Long Tail looks like.e of $8-a-gallon gas is that you'll only want to consume culture that's rich in protein.

0596009208|5.0|This book is simply the best programming book I have ever used. For learning Java it is an excellent reference as well as being humorous and capturing your attention to the point at which you can't put it down. <br /> <br />Unlike other books that drone on about one thing or another, but leave you sitting there dreaming of a nice comfortable bed (since you would be sleeping), Head First Java keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing throughout every chapter. <br /> <br />It also includes mini practice activities in every chapter that will let you try out what you just learned. This hands-on approach is, in my opinion, the best way to learn the ins and outs of any programming language. <br /> <br />I highly reccommend this book for those learning Java programming as the last book you will need in your quest.
B0002W18MU|5.0|The first breath taken as this album begins leaves the listener (in this case, it was me, just moments after purchasing it July 4th) wishing there could be more...more of the man, more of his remarkable voice.  More songs, more pain and redemption, and yes, forgiveness. <br /> <br />This album is at times somber, other times joyful.  Somber because you realize that you are listening to a man who (at the time of the recordings) was just a short while away from leaving us (a man who, before leaving, had a few more things to say to us).  It is joyful though, in that Johnny still reaches out to his audience, asks us to pull up a chair and listen.  His voice is notably weaker than in previous recordings, but that's ok.  He sounds like a loving Grandpa, sitting there, singing his songs. <br /> <br />Once again, as in the case of the other American records, there are cover songs that immediately become Cash songs.  Gordon Lightfoot's haunting \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" allows Johnny to play with powerful images, and we can feel his pain at having to say goodbye: \\"...In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains around my feet, you know that ghost is me...\\"  <br /> <br />Two songs especially stand out in my mind, as they both brought me to tears: \\"On The Evening Train\\" (track #6 on the cd) and \\"I Came to Believe\\" (track #7).  Both songs capture Johnny Cash at his best: raw and exposed, sharing so totally of himself--- he is open, vulnerable, hurting, honestly searching, and hopeful.  If only there were more artists, more men who could be so sensitive.  If only there were still more Johnny Cash.

B00025ETIW|5.0|This band is very in sync with each other and I love it. Gerard's screaming vocals (while sometimes off key. way off.) have a way of getting what he's feeling across to whoever's listening. The guitar solos are awesome, even though they haven't been around as long I put this band up there with Green Day as far as talent goes. BTW, who cares about genre? It's MUSIC.
B00005JOQS|5.0|A fantastic and very well-done movie that stayed true with the Superman mythology, yet breathing fresh air back into a franchise that I have been waiting for almost 20 years.<br /><br />The story was touching.  The cast did a wonderful job.  Director Singer paid homage to all of the Supermans in the past.<br /><br />Warner Bros. has found it's new Superman in Brandon Routh.  Kevin Spacey was a much more diabolical Lex Luthor.  Kate Bosworth stayed true to a very strong and independant Lois Lane, and with all due respect, possibly the sexiest Lois to date! And Frank Langella showed a Perry White who is simply trying to stay on top of today's competitive news, much like all the 24 hour cable TV networks do: talk about the things that people want to hear, not what they should be hearing.<br /><br />Great special effects with a great story with great characters brought to life by fine talent.<br /><br />And kudos to Mr. Ottoman.  Beautiful and inspiring music based on John Williams' original score and taken beyond any true fan of Superman could have possibly dreamed!<br /><br />This is the must-see movie this summer!<br /><br />We are all crying for a savior, someone to save the day, and Mr. Singer has delivered.<br /><br />I haven't been this excited since 1978 when an unknown actor, Christopher Reeve, brought \\"Superman\\" to the big screen with integrity, charm and gave us a feeling inside us all that maybe, just maybe, a man could really fly and make a difference in this world.<br /><br />Superman Returns!  Thank God!

B0001UL7RY|1.0|It amazes me how little talent it takes to become a rock star in this day and age.  Avril Lavigne is a perfect example of how music in the 21st century just isn't what it used to be.  I don't mean to sound like an old fart who is stuck back in the 20th century, but geeez!  I've heard construction zones that sound more musical than this annoying racket!  Those noisy guitars combined with screaming and cuss words is the most annoying sound I've ever heard!  <br /> <br />I'm begining to think that in order to be an Avril fan, you must have to be totally brain-dead, because that is the only way one could listen to this brainless, mindless cr@P!  Putting on a baggy shirt and yelling obscenities at the microphone does not take any talent!  Every other word in these songs is \\"fu*ck\\" or \\"sh*it\\", which clearly proves that Avril Lavigne doesn't have the intelligence or musical talent to come up with any decent lyrics besides obscenities.  What is wrong with you Avril fans?  Why are you too stu*pid to recognise a lack of talent when you see it?  Oh, I know why!  Your brain cells have been desensitised by the noisy guitars and Avril's very loud singing voice. That must be why you Avril fans are too stu*pid to recognise a lack of talent when you hear it.  This kind of music rots your mind and turns you into a moron.  Its like  \\"Avril Lavigne like totally rocks my world!  Rock on!  Duh!\\"  Come on Avril fans, this isn't a five star CD unless you're brain-dead.
B00005OMTT|5.0|this is amazing music, relax and free your thoughts with enigma! the best new age music you will ever hear...
B000BJS4BM|5.0|this woman's glory is that of a supreme recording artist...videos and tours notwithstanding, it will be her body of recorded work that everyone will remember about Lady Madonna, the finest \\"pop\\" female recording artist for over 20 years.... and her albums keep getting stronger and more mature with each new release.  I love the early years and the Madonna of the \\"singles\\" era...but to truly appreciate her art is to listen to the triptych consisting of \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Music\\", and the vastly and unjustly under-appreciated \\"American Life\\".  Along comes \\"Confessions On a Dance Floor\\" and simply condenses all the glory, strength, joy, and meltingly beautiful universe of dance music (and Madonna) in one album...because Madonna has always been and will always be a proponent of dance music...never has nor ever will be a fine singer (Evita comes close...quite beautiful), and she IS TO BLAME for being the \\"mother\\" of all the untalented, image conscious, diva-wanna-be whores that continue to populate our sinking-in-the-sludge world of \\"pop\\" music......but Madonna has what all the others that followed have not: a sure sense and command of popular dance music and an unerring command in the recording studio.  My the Lady reign for as long as she wishes......(but not as a spokeswoman for that horrid, crappy, and maker of disposable fashion H&M!!!!!)<br /><br />Luigi ~ NYC
B000BNI95Y|5.0|I had purchased a compilation album that included Siempre Me Quedara, and I liked the song when I first heard it, but I didn't pay much attention to it.  Then I found myself singing it all the time, and needing to listen to it first every time I got in the car.<br /><br />Becasue of that, I bought Bebe's album and I am sooooo glad I did!!  That was months ago, and I still listen to it all the time.  Interestingly, a lot of the other songs grew on me the same way that Siempre Me Quedara did--I'll hear them and then not listen to them for a while, but then return to them later and love them so much!  Just a few days ago, I rediscovered Men Senara which is my current favorite.<br /><br />I've lent my CD to many of my friends, Spanish speakers and non-Spanish speakers alike, and everyone loves it!  The lyrics are so beautiful that it's a shame if you can't understand them, but you can definitely still enjoy the music.  Also, the friends I've lent it to range in age from 24 to 44, and their reactions were all similar.  This is definitely not an album made for just one specific age group.<br /><br />A quick note: Get this version of the album, rather than the other one you'll find on Amazon.  The difference is that you get two extra songs on this one that don't appear on the original... I think that this one is the re-release for American audiences, but I could be way wrong on that.  Que Nadie Me Levante la Voz is a great song that you won't find on the version with only 13 songs.<br /><br />My only problem is that I want more!!!  Please, Bebe!  Release another album SOON!! :)
B00005JM0B|5.0|Terminator (Arnold Swarzenegger) has lost none of his talent.  He is tough, funny (but not stupid) and likable.<br /><br />John Conner (Nick Stahl) doesn't stand out in the film.  But I don't know whether that was necessary.  This is probably his biggest film, other than The Thin Red Line.  Not that I follow the box office ratings.<br /><br />Claire Danes was great as Kate Brewster.  I thought she was great in the 1998 film Les Mis&eacute;rables.  In Terminator 3 she plays the role of the participant in \\"reality\\" who takes a bit of convincing that John Conner is telling the truth about the future.  It's a bit like Snuffleupagus' old role as imaginary friend on Sesame Street.  Don't worry, the convincing doesn't take too long this time (unlike Big Bird's human friends, who didn't believe Snuffleupagus existed until Sesame Street's 17th episode!)  Anyhow, I digress.  The accusations of delusions in Terminator 3 are nowhere near as severe as those received by Sarah Conner in Terminator 2.  In this, she is imprisoned in Pescadero State Hospital, a mental institution.<br /><br />TX (Kristanna Loken) was great.  Detached, bloodthirsty and great in an action film.<br /><br />With regard to comparisons to the other Terminator films (which so many reviewers seem to be doing).  I love them all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like great story telling, don't pass up Firefly.  It is the first television show in decades to wisk me away.  Not since the original screning of Star Wars have I been so enchanted.  If you are a human being with a soul for adventure, humor, and friendship; you will fall in love with Firefly.    Simply the best in the verse
0312995423|3.0|After reading \\"Digital Fortress\\" I've finally read all four Dan Brown books to date and I find myself in a love/hate relationship with this author. I couldn't care less about the hype surrounding him because of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". But despite having a great gift for writing engaging and suspenseful prose, for me Brown always loses himself three quarters of the way in. In other circumstances, it's falling in old boring clich&eacute;s. Here the plot just becomes a laughing stock for anyone who's even remotely computer-savvy.<br /><br />In \\"Digital Fortress\\", two different plots are interleaved, one happening at the NSA headquarters wherever that is and the other happening in Seville, Spain. None is believable, both are page-turners. Being the first of Brown's books, it seems this is the blueprint for what was to come. Inevitably someone dies in the prelude. Inevitably there's a hot chick with brains. Inevitably there's the innocent smart guy who has to figure out all the riddles and gets to keep the broad in the end. Meanwhile, some mean vicious assassin is repeatedly fooled along with his master, until they're eventually defeated. World is saved, all is well again, until the next adventure.<br /><br />Put in perspective, this was still my second favorite Dan Brown book, following \\"Angels & Demons\\". There's that something in his writing that makes me come back but inevitably I reach the end in frustration. \\"Digital Fortress\\" was no exception, and even more so because it was really good until a certain point.
0321344758|5.0|The author definitely practices what he preaches by keeping the book short, to the point and very enjoyable to read. I did not read the first edition, but this book was a great! I would have loved to have seen more real-situation examples, but otherwise well worth my money and a must have for all web designers.
B000EGDB10|5.0|a reviewer below me called the storyline to this movie \\"a jumbled mess\\". oh my, how wrong he is. although, i will admit... i did not fully understand the storyline to this movie for TEN years. that doesn't mean it was a jumbled mess, though. it only means that my feeble mind wasn't able to comprehend the depth, detail and layers to it at first. so, TEN years later (2006) i watched it for what was probably the 20th odd time, and i FINALLY understood all of the twists and turns in the storyline and it all came together so beautifully. it was like poetry. it was one of those moments where you sit back and say to yourself \\"how in the hell can someone write something so ingenious?\\". so anyways, my point is: this movie has depth. it has layers upon layers upon layers. this is nothing like MI2 or MI3. this is a thinking-mans movie, and it is aesthetically beautiful in a very artistic way. each time you watch it, a new part of the story will reveal itself for you. and that's why i think this is the best M:I movie in the series BY FAR. compared to this one, the other two subsuquent sequals are loud, unintelligent and highly forgettable. like another reviewer said before me... this is one of the best action films i have ever seen. get it.
B00005U122|5.0|Some love Waters and hate Gilmour. Others do it the other way around. I say love them both, because honestly together they've done some of the best music ever. In \\"In The Flesh (Live)\\" we get a great taste of the Floyd legacy, performed by incredible musicians who make this DVD as indispensable as they come.<br /><br />Starting out with the unavoidable \\"In The Flesh\\" and naturally flowing into more \\"The Wall\\" material (including what is probably the most heartfelt rendition of \\"Mother\\" I've ever seen), I think this show really starts to shine with \\"Dogs\\". You can't really tell this is a 17-minute epic, because it just flies by. What really struck me was Jon Carin's voice, the keyboard/guitar/lap steel player who just sits up there quietly doing his thing until this point and here unleashes a powerful, forceful tone. The musicians are all top notch, from the incredible stand-ins of Doyle Bramhall II (this guy is just spot on) and the classy Snowy White, to a brief appearance of Norbert Statchel on sax for \\"Money\\" and \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun\\", well... the list goes on. The background singers are beautiful and sing just lovely. The perfect backdrop for all that's going on around them.<br /><br />The solo Waters songs also get appropriate treatment, with highlights for me being \\"Amused to Death\\", \\"Perfect Sense\\" and \\"Each Small Candle\\". Finally, many probably agree that the highest moment of this show is undoubtedly \\"Comfortably Numb\\" with Bramhall and Snowy White trading back and forth parts of one of the best guitar solos ever laid on track.<br /><br />Technically, the image quality is excellent, and the soundtrack is crystal clear. I have absolutely no objections to the technical merit of this release. My only complain is the lack of extra material, which includes only an 18 minute documentary about this tour plus some stills and biographies of each band member. I'm still giving this 5 stars based on the sheer brilliance of the show itself, though.<br /><br />This is an absolutely must-have DVD. Period.hough. <br /> <br />This is an absolutely must-have DVD.

1594481717|5.0|[...]    Say goodbye to the Information Age, we're entering an exciting new age.  In the past \\"ages\\", certain things were extremely valuable.  In the Agricultural Age, farms were important.  Economies existed to support the farmers and the farm.  The rich people were the farm owners, and almost everyone worked to support the farm in some way.    Then we moved into the Industrial Age.  Farms became less important, and factories became the thing that economies were built around.  The job to have was the job of the factory worker, standing on a factory line doing your part to assemble something.  The rich were the people that owned and ran the factories.  The job of the farmhand was disappearing, as machines were being invented to take their jobs, and farmers had to keep buying more expensive and complicated machinery just to make it and compete as a farmer.    Then came the Information Age.  The job of the factory worker was slowly being replaced by automation, immigrants (both legal and illegal), and overseas labor. And because of technology, running a farm only required a fraction of the help it needed in the past.  The job to have was that of the \\"information\\" guy; the guy that had all the answers to all the questions, the person that could do things that others couldn't or wouldn't.  The Information Age was the age of the left brainers.  Accountants, computer software coders, troubleshooters, doctors, all those jobs were in high demand.  That's what our parents told us we should be when we grow up.    We're entering a new age now, an age where the accountant's job, the coder's job, even the doctor's job is being outsourced to Asia, or taken over by a computer program.  The job of the telephone troubleshooter has moved to India.  The job of the coder is being moved there.  The accountant's job of sticking numbers into a formula is going away.  You can even get surgeries performed in Asia for a fraction of the cost, with the same level of quality, and take an exoticvacation while you're there.    Ask yourself three questions:  Can my job be done faster by a computer?  Can my job be done cheaper by someone in Asia?  In this world of abundance, where I can get anything I want, anytime I want it, and pay almost nothing for it, what do I have to offer?  If your answer to the first two questions is \\"yes\\", or you don't have an answer to the third question, be afraid.  Be very, very afraid.  It's likely that the job that you're doing now will disappear in the next few years.    If you are one of the millions of people who's job will be moved overseas, you have a choice.      Choice #1 is to keep doing what you're doing, lose your job, and complain about it.    Choice #2 is to do whatever you can in the time you have left in your current position to become the most valuable employee you can. You can't predict the future, but you can prepare for it by growing your skills so you're prepared to do something else when your job is outsourced.  If, when it's time for your job to go away, you are too valuable to be let go, they'll find something else for you to do.  Better yet, you can spend the time you have left learning how to do something new, and can move seamlessly into your new role when the time comes.    Which is the easier choice?  #1 always is.  Which will get you better results?  #2 of course.      But what most people forget is this:  You have a choice.      Sure, it's easy to complain when your job gets taken by someone or something that can do it cheaper or faster, but guess what?  This is always going to happen, and whatever is happening now is only going to get worse.    What can be done about this?  All you have to do is make yourself valuable.  I run into so many people that believe that since they've been with a company for so long, the company owes them something.  This type of thinking is outdated.  Companies can no longer offer you a job for life.  What I mean by that is that companies can no longer offer you the samejob for life.      In order to survive in the world we live in today, you have to be able to, at the very least, adapt to the changes that will inevitably happen.    Better yet, anticipate that change before it happens, prepare for it, and when it happens you'll have already made the transition.    Don't complain about your job being moved to Asia.  There are enough complainers in this world already.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Because Tool have this tendency to release their albums five years apart and because there's also this other tendency of producing masterpieces, turns out the anticipation prior to each release reaches fever pitch. Perhaps \\"10,000 Days\\" has disappointed some people, and it certainly puzzled me for the first couple of days, but now I'm pretty sure this is quite simply \\"just\\" another Tool work of art.<br /><br />As usual, the album is broken down into segments, groupings of tracks even if it all naturally flows from start to finish and it's over before you know it. \\"Vicarious\\" starts off powerful, great riffing and in a sense it reminded me both of Aenima, Lateralus and even A Perfect Circle mixed together. It segues naturally into \\"Jambi\\" which is another powerhouse of a track, including a most excellent talk box solo by Tool's guitar player Adam Jones.<br /><br />I had some hard time trying to intuitively make sense of the \\"Wings For Marie\\"/\\"10,000 Days\\" segment that follows, but it was just a matter of turning the volume up a notch and letting myself get involved in the eerie atmosphere of these tracks. Beautiful, just beautiful. And moving.<br /><br />From here, highlights for me are definitely \\"The Pot\\", old school Tool again with a great riff and \\"Right in Two\\", a beautiful slow song which showcases Keenan's amazing capabilities. The rest of the band is at the very top of their form as well. The music tends to revolve around Jones' guitar, which is versatile as always, but Justin Chancellor really does a great job with a lot of unconventional and powerful bass lines. As for Danny Carey, what else to say, this guy is simply one of the best drummers out there these days.<br /><br />It's still too early to say whether this can be Tool's best album ever - and does it matter? - but it's already obvious that they did not disappoint at all. This band has undeniably been on a constant progression and refinement of their craft with each release, this one being no exception. The test of time will tell how good this album really is. Certainly one of the best of 2006.exception. The test of time will tell how good this album really is. Certainly one of the best of 2006.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|YES!  I finally get the original-original trilogy on DVD!  Watched this one last night and it looks fine!  I guess shunning the special edition and waiting, and holding out and waiting some more finally payed off!  Both versions of the trilogy for fifty bucks!  <br /> <br />And the original set isn't as bad as people are saying.  It looks fine to us peons that don't have the budget of a small municipality to buy a 60-inch super plasma flat panel TV. <br /> <br />I feel for those of you who shelled out money for various versions of the movies, but stop singling out George Lucas.  This marketing tactic is hardly unique and he is by no means the only one doing it.   <br /> <br />THEY ALL ARE.   <br /> <br />
B000002KXV|5.0|Great LP/CD highly recommended and if you are looking at this I'm probably preaching to the choir. If not, this piece of music is one half the duo of Steely Dan, yet 90% of the music. As such, this album sounds like the great early SD albums. Buy it.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Yes, it's scary, but did you know that this isn't a horror movie? <br /> <br />Not really. <br /> <br />You should know that, despite the trailers during its theatrical release, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is more of a courtroom drama than a horror flick. Now, ask yourself: were there *any* scenes out of a courtroom from the film's trailer? Any shots of the defense attorney (who is the main character)? Why didn't they want to be upfront about the film? Why did they want it to seem like it was a supernatural thriller a la Stigmata? <br /> <br />I don't know, because it's a pretty good courtroom drama, and made more interesting by having an element of horror about it, an element of the supernatural. However, at heart, this is a movie about whether or not those things *could* exist, and respecting those people who believe it, and not primarily a movie about demons trying to kill people. It's a movie about the role that faith plays in our lives. <br /> <br />All that said, the horror-elements are well-done. My fiancee jumped five or six times during the film. :) Its horror is mainly found in suspense; not a lot actually *happens* other than Emily Rose looking evil and twisted at the camera, but it's still effective and the exorcism scene is excellent and powerful. <br /> <br />It claims to be based on a true story. I don't know the details of that true story, or how close this movie gets to it, but I can believe that something like this could happen. This is more of a philosophical piece than a modern horror flick (it has nothing in common with, say, Saw or Scream), but I'm here to tell you--that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's room for Saws and Screams, and room for this movie, too. It's only unfortunate that the film's creators didn't think it would sell as well, if they were straight-forward as to what it's actually about.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: this movie is thought-provoking, interesting and entertaining. Four stars.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|this album is gemerally a crowd pleaser but will not stand the test of time to become a great LP. good violent femmes cover, fun, upbeat mix of electronica, hip hop, and rock. you'll likely listen to this for about 3 mos and then probably sparingly.....
0805211063|4.0|With its labyrinthine backdrop and its claustrophobic atmosphere, \\"The Castle\\" is, above all, a novel about frustration: irritation at ignorance, exasperation with complacency, and above all, annoyance with bureaucracy.<br /><br />And it can be frustrating for readers, too. The book was unfinished; it ends mid-sentence; and the new Harman translation (which is the one I read) attempts to restore the book to its raw, unpunctuated state. Because its themes center on the mindlessness of officialdom and the repetitiveness of red tape, Kafka's portrayal can seem mindless and repetitive. (Nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where K. visits with Burgel, whose interminable monologue lulls K. to sleep. It worked like a charm on me, too, and I had to reread the chapter.)<br /><br />Yet the book contains passages both memorable and quotable, characters that are recognizable, and mysteries (however unsolved) that can be fascinating. As a result, it's a book best read in small doses to appreciate both the author's dry (and even slapstick) humor and, even more, the work's satirical bite.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, can be summarized in a brief description. Called to work as a land surveyor for village, K. arrives only to discover that the request was a mistake, that none of the officials in the Castle will take responsibility for their mistake or meet with him to discuss it, and that the townsfolk neither know nor care what it is that the officials and their secretaries do. In short, nobody gets into the Castle. Instead, K. is given a job as a janitor in a school, falls in love with a barmaid, and attempts to meet with Klamm, the official who has allegedly been assigned to his \\"case.\\"<br /><br />The Castle's functionless bureaucrats cannot be said to impede K.'s quest; they are hardly seen during the course of his stay. K.'s frustration is amplified not by their active interference but rather by their negligence and obfuscation. The result is far worse, since K. can't even identify with whom he should be struggling or how he should proceed. The officials and their secretaries are so busy with their own paperwork and routines that they really don't have time to attend to anything else, least of all concern themselves with problems that have nothing to do with the nothing they themselves do.<br /><br />\\"True, they say that all of us belong to the Castle,\\" admits a young village woman named Olga, who sympathizes with K.'s pursuit and who describes how the Castle's insouciance destroyed her own family. \\"But where in all this do you see the influence of the Castle?\\" K. responds. \\"It doesn't seem to have intervened yet. What you have told me up to now is nothing more than the mindless timidity of the people.\\" Not fully comprehending his own revelation, K. identifies that the problem lies not in the Castle; instead it lies without.K. can't even identify with whom he should be struggling or how he should proceed.

My 20 month old loves the book and for the price they are great books with very cute and simple stories.  Construction is board like, but not the really thick stuff.  This would not be a good book to teeth on.  But the construction is durable and the colors are fantastic.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I myself loved the new cd. Yes, AFI changed their music drastically. No more did they sound punk, but to me, they sounded a little emo. Not only did their music change, but their appearance changed too. This was not a bad move though. It seems that all bands are leaving their pop-punk backgrounds, to a more emo or goth sound, becuase right now, screamo and emo music is the fad. I have to say that I think Love Like Winter and the Prelude are the best songs on the cd, and Miss Murder would have to be the weakest, even though that too is a great song. I loved the NIN's remix, \\"Head Like Hole\\" They put a new spin on a already great song. I would recommend this cd to anyone, even if before they were not an AFI fan.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I really like this album despite what other people say! some might think theve sold out or gone mainstream, but i just think they've maturing and progressed, trying new things with there music, and i think they've done it really well! <br />well done afi!

No way. <br /> <br />Too slow... too boring....  <br /> <br />Many things do not make sense in this book and it was frustrating to read through them. Move on to another book on your list. This one is not worth it.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|This is just a CGI display of anime cliches and pointless fan service. FF7 is one of the most overrated things, ever. The story is about as captivating as the lyrics of a Helloween song. The characters are soulless, cardboard-like creatures, masquerading in hideous costumes and spikey hair to influence thousands of cosplayers to further fail at life. There was this scene where the characters were throwing Cloud in the air to hit some flying monster or something, as they issued him sunny encouragement like \\"no giving up!\\" I just sat there in awe of the stupidity on display, wondering how this cinematic jello inspired its own subculture.
0451205766|5.0|I saw the movie... so naturally, I have to read the book to find out how Coppola screwed up the actual book. After the first page, I was hooked and could not put this book down.

1416909532|1.0|I bought this book because I've been hearing the title tossed about.  While stating the obvious dating wisdom, it's not clear for whom this book is for.  Is it a \\"reinflate my ego after the breakup\\" or a break-up instigator ?  Laced with the hackneyed \\"men are pigs\\" buzz phrases, this book presents a series of fake letters and \\"statistics\\" as real.  Email is not an important form of communication ?  Has this author never had a good IM or cell-phone message session?  That's the modern form for love letters.  Perhaps he's just too old to comment on the communication of those currently at breeding age. <br /> <br />Men and women have somehow managed to get married for all of time, but there have always been a percentage of them that never did.

B00005JOSS|5.0|Here -- in \\"The Lake House\\" -- is a summertime movie for all seasons that will persuade some of us (at least including my wife and myself) that there still is hope for Hollywood.    It's more than the Jane Austen analogy (that ties \\"Persuasion\\" to the plot of this movie) that helps it succeed, although it just figures that Ms. Austen would enjoy this movie.  Your mind (if it was not dormant upon your arrival in the theater) is wide awake in this movie, and you find yourself thinking ... which likely was not what you had in mind before the show, given the images projected by some (perhaps) well-meaning critics.    This movie is really good -- far beyond the norm for a \\"good\\" summertime movie, and well into the genre of movies for all seasons that you would be delighted to see again.  Ann and I already have seen \\"The Lake House\\" twice, and while we enjoyed it enough to return (a rare occurrence indeed), we liked it even more the second time around.     Everything about this movie is really good -- the plot, the actors, the pace, the music, the messages, the imagery, the dog, the architecture, the scenery, the fundamental honesty, the hopeful idealism, and the creative imagination -- as well as the perspective in which all of those elements are wrapped for presentation to you as a viewer.    You leave the theater with real appreciation for this movie, all of it, like an unexpectedly wonderful dinner that leaves you wondering whether it might be appropriate not to eat another meal (at least for a few days) just to do this one honor.    That is why this review really is just a way of saying thank you to the folks who made this movie.
0618477942|5.0|From Alison Bechdel, author of the comic strip \\"Dykes to Watch Out For,\\" comes a memoir of coming out and coming to terms with both the life and death of her closeted father.  The funny \\"gay\\" memoir seems to be the latest trend, and I'll admit that I approached this book with more than a little trepidation.  However, \\"Fun Home\\" has proven a happy surprise, a unique and first rate comic work by a truly serious artist.<br /><br />It took me awhile to set down and attempt to put into words what I found so special about this book.  First, this is a graphic book (a \\"comic\\" book if you will), and one that is equal parts graphic and comic in its depiction of a very real American family.  Being raised in a funeral home in small town America could prove a challenge for anyone.  Being an adolescent girl awakening to her own lesbianism with a closet case father who is both your High School English teacher and the local funeral director, is the stuff of great literature.<br /><br />The author has an acute sense of the absurd, and an unparralleld ability to communicate life's little ironies.  Without ever losing affection for her emotionally remote parents, Bechdel cuts to the heart of the matter and draws them warts and all.  \\"Fun Home\\" is a genuine marvel, a truly tragicomic memoir and one of the highlights of the publishing year thus far.  Don't miss it.
0671799320|4.0|The Prize is an epic on the history of exploration for oil and economic supremacy.  Meticulous in detail, the book is very readable and a fascinating portrait of the countries, companies & individuals who helped shape oil and it's importance in a mechanized carbon based society.<br /><br />The book starts in the sleepy oil towns of Pennsylvania, moves through the Rockefeller oligarchy, then Spindletop and Dad Joiner in Texas and the Texas Railroad commission, and finally the Mideast.<br /><br />There is no question of the strategic importance of oil, first illustrated in World War I when the French used taxis to help depleted troops.  Thereafter under Churchill's directive the English converted their wartime economy from coal to oil.  Patton in World War II blitzed through Germany until he was slowed by a lack of oil - same for Rommel in Africa.  There is no question the current interest in MidEast poltics is because it has the largest proven reserves of oil.  Which country and companies will have complete economic hegemony over this great prize?<br /><br />It's naïve not to recognize oil and the U.S. current involvement in the MidEast, military bases in Saudi Arabia and soon in Iraq to control the world's greatest prize<br /><br />Great book, very readable, it won't teach how an internal combustion engine works, it will however take you through the politics of oil over since the late 19th century.<br /><br />I agree with a reviewer below that found the book to be a bit hypocritical describing oil transnationals as seeking value and dealing with rapacious countries and the concessions involved.  Aren't both parties greedy and self-interested?  Soviet aggression in the MidEast versus the U.S. and England defending self-interests.  I believe the MidEast countries and the former USSR would write a decidedly different modern history of oil.  Regardless, it's still a fabulous book and one can make up their own mind after reading it
1401302378|5.0|\\"Pareto's Law\\" (80/20) and the era of \\"one size fits all\\" are becoming far less important, according to Anderson.  \\"The Long Tail\\" focuses on the new opportunities brought about by the Internet, various search engines, and other technologies (eg. desktop publishing, computer-controlled equipment that allows economic manufacture of single items) that allow economic service to much smaller markets than before.<br /><br />The Internet's value in this rests on its ability to pull customers from a much larger area than bricks and mortar stores at very low incremental cost, its ability to distribute some items at very low costs (eg. downloads of photos, videos, games, small pamphlets - eliminating inventory), and its ability to utilize search engines to help users quickly find what they are looking for.  Ideally the search engine utilizes knowledge of the consumer (eg. provided via registration and prior search history) to help him/her in their search.<br /><br />Even complex, expensive manufactured goods are affected - software allows combining and searching among several inventory sites - thereby better serving customers with unique wants.<br /><br />As an example of new opportunities, Anderson points out that the average Borders carries about 100,000 titles, while Amazon gets about one-quarter of its sales from outside the top 100,000.  Similarly, Google makes most of its money from small advertisers.  Overall, 2004 books sales totaled 17,396,510 for those selling 1 million or more (10), and almost as many (14,346,417) for the 948,005 books selling 99 or fewer copies.<br /><br />And where do these \\"new sales\\" come from, asks Anderson?  Answering his own question, he contends that they mostly come from the existing high-volume sellers.

0895260131|4.0|Spencer tells us that Muslims must wage war to impose Islamic law on non-Muslim states, and that anyone (eg. Danish cartoonists) who insults or opposes Muhammad or his people deserves a humiliating death.  Thus, \\"war\\" and \\"intolerance\\" are two key components of Islam.<br /><br />He uses anecdotes from Muhammad's life to illustrate Koranic statements, as well as comparisons with Christ.  (Such comparisons, however, are difficult as neither the Bible nor the Koran are entirely consistent within themselves,  though later Koranic versus are supposed to have greater validity, according to some experts.)<br /><br />As for women, the Koran tells us that their testimony is worth half that of a man, wife-beating of the disobedient is sanctioned, child marriages are OK, and a son's inheritance should be twice that of his sister.  In 3/02 15 young Muslim girls were allowed to die in a fire because they were not wearing the proper outside attire and thus had to stay inside.  Some Islamists also oppose education for women.<br /><br />It is sometimes claimed that Islam has helped art, science, and music to flourish in Arab lands.  \\"Not so,\\" says Spencer - whatever was created either came before Islam, was copied from others, or resulted in spite of Islam.  There are no \\"Beethovens,\\" \\"Einsteins,\\" or \\"Monets\\" in the Islamic world.  The conflict with science, according to Spencer, occurs because some Islamic religious leaders see Allah as free - not bound by laws of nature.  (This seems like weak logic, and there probably is more to it.)<br /><br />Paradise is only guaranteed for those who slay and are slain \\"for Allah,\\" and consists of physical pleasures.<br /><br />Christian participation in the Crusades was in response to centuries of growing Muslim aggression, and aimed at recapture of Christian lands and the defense of those threatened by Arabs - not religious imperialism by Christians.  On the other hand, it is true that the Christians did divert at times to terrorize and massacre Jews.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Spencer is not very optimistic about our being able to accept Islamic practices or get along peacefully over time.ize and massacre Jews. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  Spencer is not very optimistic about our being able to accept Islamic practices or get along peacefully over time.

B000AYEL6U|4.0|I came to this mini-series as a fan of the original book by Elizabeth Gaskell (which, by the way, if you haven't read, go and read now!) and of Gaskell's novels in general, as well as of other mini-series based on classic novels such as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  And overall I was very pleased.  As far as I can tell, not having read the book for a year or two, the makers of the movie made only minor changes, such as were necessary for the different format or the limited length.  Those who love the book need not hesitate to watch this mini-series for fear of huge alterations in the plot or characters.<br /><br />The one exception, the one change that bothered me, was the ending, that is, the train-station scene.  Yes, it was very romantic, but it was also highly unrealistic, to the point that it distracted me from enjoying the romance.  (N.B.: This paragraph contains spoilers for the ending.  I have to vent my feelings...)  First of all, no one in the Victorian era would kiss in public, in the middle of a train station.  That would have been considered extremely improper.  I could have forgiven that, for the sake of romance, but then she goes home with him, and a woman living with the man she is going to marry before the wedding definitely would not have been done in that time-period.  Besides, wouldn't she need to go home to get her clothes?  Wouldn't she have the courtesy to tell her family where she was going?  I'm sorry, but I really think they could have made a good romantic ending without it being so completely outside the realm of possibility.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that North and South the book is not solely, perhaps not even primarily, a romance.  It is in many ways a novel of ideas, meant to address the problem of industrial master/worker relationships.  The mini-series, however, focuses a little more on the romance aspect.  It also portrays Margaret's friendship with the Higginses as being on slightly more equal terms than in the book, which, although more pleasant to modern sensibilites, kind of downplays the very real problem of inequality which existed at that time.<br /><br />To revert to praise, the acting was brilliant; I cannot think of a single actor whose performance was less than satisfactory, or which jarred with the rest of the movie.  The sets and costumes were likewise perfect, and I particularly enjoyed the beautiful score.  Regarding the DVD specifically, there weren't all that many special features, but those there were were interesting.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the unrealistic-ness of the ending, but otherwise \\"North and South\\" was excellent, and I recommend it to lovers of the book or of period drama.which, although more pleasant to modern sensibilites, kind of downplays the very real problem of inequality which existed at that time. <br /> <br />To revert to praise, the acting was brilliant; I cannot think of a single actor whose performance was less than satisfactory, or which jarred with the rest of the movie.

B000001GQD|5.0|Richter's work has long been a benchmark in the library of piano virtuosity, but in these two selections, he has transcended normal experience.  For an artist to insert himself into the world of music on such a grand scale is to take great risks, and that is exactly what he has done.  I believe that at a point, Richter and the music become one and the same.  It is as though he were fused to each note.  The result is a performance that is both flawless and yet, warm, sonorous and full.  There is nothing that he has left out. He is an artist for the ages, and we are richer for his presence at the keyboard.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I am a self-proclaimed lover of musical theatre. And although I own  almost every major Broadway and Off-Broadway soundtrack, and have seen most of the classics at least once or twice, I somehow let Rent slip through the cracks. Not, by any means, because I never heard of it, but, rather, because I made the all too often fatal mistake of listening to the musical theatre elitists who turn their nose up at anything that wasn't written by Stephen Sondheim. Sure, I heard the story: an update of La Boehme that replaces Mimi with a stripper and the plague with AIDS. I also heard of the untimely death of the young composer, and even bought into the urban legend that he died of AIDS (which could not be further from the truth). But, somehow, I took a pass on the show, the soundtrack, and the whole sordid affair. The \\"rentheads\\" just seemed far too giddy for me to believe that they were actually worshipping something of value. Boy was I wrong.    When the movie came out, I was tempted to go see it, but I took yet another pass, for all the same reasons. But the DVD was convenient enough for me to give it a spin. And what a spin it was. As a piece of musical theatre, Rent is not without its issues - all of which have been stated very eloquently before. The plot is a little weak and the lyrics could have used a little refining. But THE MUSIC! Oh, that music! I was bowled over from the first half minute. Jonathan Larson was far from a musical genius - which is exactly why the music is so incredibly good. Combining simple, memorable melodies with incredible multi-part harmonies, the notes sing to you all by themselves. I was left wondering where this play had been all my life.    But this is not intended to be a review of the show itself. What I am here to do today is review the DVD. And I made you sit through the long introduction above because it is very relevant to what I am about to write.  Like most any other operatic musical, it is very hard to translate to film without it feelng like you are watching a studio version of the play itself. The magic of the theatre is lost on film, and most musicals are very difficult to adapt without a whopping serving of cheese. Jesus Christ Superstar, Godspell, Hair, Evita, Phantom Of The Opera, and a slew of others have all suffered from the same fate. And, I'm afraid to say that Rent joins the pack of musicals that just didn't quite translate. Many an ambitious Director have tried. And the only one who has ever succeded, in my opinion, is Rob Marshall with Chicago. How? By filming it like an old style Hollywood musical with an updated modern feel, instead of trying to set the stage version to film. Chris Columbus, who directed Rent, chose to go the other route - adapting the stage show to a series of elaborate sets and unimaginable backgrounds which try to imitate reality, and might have suceeded were it not for all of the frolicking and singing going on. And that's where the conflict lies. Modern Hollywood movies show unrealistic things happening in realistic settings. Stage musicals show realistic things happening in unrealistic settings. So the only way to translate them properly is to do as Chicago did and as the old-style Hollywood musicals did; don't try to be too real. Well, Chris Columbus, with his roots in 1980's New York City, missed that entire point and tried too hard to make it all real for us. And, in so doing, he, in my opinion, failed.    But that's not the only way in which Mr. Columbus failed us. In watching the movie, I had a unique perspective because I had absolutely no previous exposure to the story. And, unfortunately, were it not for the music, I might never have felt any emotion at all because the movie never gives us any emotional attachment to any of the characters. I won't go into plot lines here, but I can tell you that nothing held together. The relationships were just never established. And then I watched the excellent Special Features disc which included all of the cutscenes. And, all of a sudden, everything came together. After watching only 4 of the deleted scenes, I was suddenly able to feel the entire movie. Mark explains his internal struggles, Mimi explains her attachment to Roger, Roger and Mark explain their attachment to one another, and Benny explains his relationship with Mimi. And, with that, you can suddenly understand and relate to the rest of the movie in an entirely different way. Then I made the mistake of turning the Director commentary on during those cut scenes, and I was all the more infuriated to listen in on Chris Columbus flip-flopping back and forth as to whether or not the scenes actually should have been cut. It was like listening to a child trying to justify himself into a position which he knew he should never have taken. This was most evident during his description of the alternate ending in which the actors return to the same stage on which they began, to sing the finale in the same setting where they sang the introduction. This was the only 'theatrical' moment of the entire movie where he actually put the actors on stage where they belong. Tying the ending to the beginning in this way might just have made everything else seem like somebody else's re-telling of their story, or as a part of Mark's film - which could have actually worked. But, instead he decided to cut it because, as he put it, it was too far the beginning and he didn't think the audience would remember it enough to tie the two together. Never underestimate us, Chris. It all left me a little angry, to tell you the truth. But I was also left feeling fortunate to have seen this movie for the first time on DVD so that I could also see these cut scenes and benefit from the composer's original vision - one which made much more sense than that of Chris Columbus.    So it may sound like I'm bashing the Director here, and, in reality, I'm probably not cutting him enough slack. Because I think his intentions were probably good. The problem, as far as I could see it, is that he knew the story too well. So it held together far better for him than for someone like me who had never seen or heard the story before. But there was also a lot that he did right. The decision to use 6 out of 8 of the original cast members, for one. The chemistry, vocal chops, and dramatic timing of Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, and Jesse L. Martin are spectacular and work perfectly together. And the seemless introductions of Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms are equally impressive. The music and accompanying arrangements sound modern, fresh, and well produced, and the blocking, camera work, and timing are all beyond compare. So, although he got a lot of it wrong, he does deserve due credit for getting a lot of things very, very right.    But the real star of this show is still the Special Features disc and, more appropriately stated, the composer, Jonathan Larson. The accompanying cut scenes are a necessity so I won't give the DVD too much credit for including them, but the 2-hour documentary entitled No Day But Today is a gem that could have demanded the entire price of the DVD all by itself. In it, we learn about the life of Jonathan Larson, the humble, eccentric, and, yes, very straight composer of Rent. Not that being straight is relevant to anything other than the fact that there is an eerie and unsettling feeling associated with a person, like myself, who assumed for 10 years that the composer of a play about AIDS must have been homosexual, and then one day, suddenly realizes that my otherwise open mind could have been so easily closed by prejudice and lies. A humbling experience to say the least. In any case, Jonathan Larson's story is told with such eloquence and such feeling that it is even more emotionally insightful than the movie itself. In fact, it was only after watching this documentary that I was truly hooked on the story of Rent. And it is then that you realize that Jonathan Larson's story is as much a part of the success of Rent as the story of the play itself. And maybe it is only through his death that the true story can completely unfold and be felt. This documentary reached me on many levels. It left me speechless. And, as you can tell by the length of this review, that is a rare occurence.    So, in short, I was inspired by Rent - but as much, if not more, by the story of its composer than by the story itself. They are truly one. I am grateful for having been so grossly misinformed and for not having seen Rent before, because I truly believe that the only way I would have truly enjoyed it is not as a 3-hour play, or as a 2-hour movie, but as a 4-hour movie/documentary that paints the entire picture. And it is a picture that I will not soon forget.    Summary: 5-stars for the music, 4-stars for the book, 3-stars for the lyrics, 3-stars for the movie, 6-stars for the documentary. That averages out to about 4-stars. So that's where I'll leave it. But only with these words: Buy this DVD, watch both discs in their entirety, and just let the music and the story reach you as they did me. The feeling will be with you for a long time.
B000EGCITQ|4.0|After reading the majority of reviews I was thinking to myself \\"Hey, this is Pink, it can't be that bad!\\". And guess what, it's not. If you, like me, absolutely loved 'Falling' from her first album then you will enjoy this. Some of the songs show a much more subtle side of Pink - 'Who Knew', 'Dear Mr President' and 'Nobody Knows'. Those looking for Pink to be her flamboyant self will enjoy 'Fingers' or 'Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)', the second one definitely has a pop feel to it - despite the swearing (but, hey, this is PINK!). I actually enjoyed this album more than her others, purely coz I have only heard 2 songs released in the UK so far so the rest I could make my own opinion of without all the hype usually attached to a song (Was it Number 1, did it bomb in the charts etc). I thought that this showed Pink's singing versatily rather than her Punk 'Screaming' which has been more prominant on other albums. If you want to hear a mellow(er) Pink, this album delivers.

B000E5KJFC|5.0|I was able to do an A and B comparison of Swordfish on DVD and HD-DVD by switching from one to the other on my TV. <br /> <br />The DVD's colours were off. There was too much green and blue in the picture and not enough red, which made the whole movie over saturated with those colours and gave flesh tones an unrealistic look. Colour bleeding was also evident on certain scenes. Futhermore, the image was soft and blurred. The soundtrack was good but seemed to lack an umph feel to it. <br /> <br />Switching to HD-DVD, what a difference Colours are accurate, flesh tones are natural and there is no evidence of colour bleeding. The image was very sharp and this was with the sharpness on my TV turned completely off. The Dolby Digital Plus track was bumpin'. It was extremely directional and powerful with my subwoofer getting a good workout. <br /> <br />HD-DVD has arrived, and Swordfish does a great job showing off what HD-DVD can do.

B00005JOYA|5.0|\\"It is rare to see a good horror at these days, but thank god Silent Hill makes an exception.\\" <br />I know that there are some good \\"horror\\" movies out there (like saw, and Dawn Of The Dead 2004), but most of the others doesn't make a good of an horror. They are cheap, action packed movies where the horror is that something suddenly jumps in front of you and scares you. (It just isn't right) It is cheap way to make horror. <br />I had given up to the horror genre... Then silent hill came, and it was just had what we needed, a horror with psychologic factor in it. (I know that even in Silent Hill there are scenes where something jumps out to freak you, but thank god they are not even close to the other such movies.) <br /> <br />There seems to be somekind of an curse with almost all game movies. None of them didn't came out to be good. Perhaps it is because gamestudios gives most of their game licences to directors who thinks it is just a walk in the park. Infact making game into good movie is very hard. Sadly almost none of the directors or gamesudios doesn't seem to realize that making game you need someone who actually knows about games, I would say that making a game into movie is very binding and devotionary task. Not all have what it takes. Those should just withdraw from project, only for people who actually thinks that they have what it takes to make it should give a try. We all know that Paul W.S. Anderson and Uwe Boll doesn't have it. But all this was before Silent Hill, for my opinion now there is a chance to make a game into good movie. <br /> <br />The Silent Hill is a movie with quite interesting plot, unfortunately for a viewer who is unfamiliar with Silent Hill games, doesnt get a much out of it. That's why there are people who doesnt like it at all, and there are people who liked it a lot. It seems that there is division into two. People who likes and the ones that don't.  <br /> <br />Silent Hill is very disturbing movie. For example the scene with\\"janitor\\", i felt kind of an uneasy (in good way, like it is supposed to feel, It's HORROR.) Anyway, that is what gives the impression of a something that is human but awkwardly distorted... And that is what Silent Hill is about. <br /> <br />Me likes. <br /> <br />-I would recommend this movie warmly for people who liked the games and the ones who actually have played them trough.  <br />-For the people who seeks an deeper plot, and/or who seeks a differend horror, i would suggest to consider this movie very seriously. <br />-But then there are people who only likes someting like \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or \\"Assault on Precinct 13(1976)\\" or \\"Psycho(1960)\\", or similiar old or more of an mainstream old \\"B-class\\" movies. (Basicly non gamers and who doesn't like anything new.) For those people i would suggest to go watch something else. <br />Usually raitings are: <br />Average viewer: */***** <br />Gamer: ****/***** <br /> <br />~While waiting for more \\"Devil's Lyric\\"~

B00005JNRY|5.0|Sheryl Crow's defiant song begins this film with \\"When I see something that I don't like I gotta say it . . . you've got your blinders on.  Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone\\"<br /><br />If you think this is a kid's movie.  You're right.  But it has a story that may hit home for many adults.  I won't spoil the ending, but it made me more emotional than I saw coming.<br /><br />You might expect that a movie about shiny talking race cars will have an exciting, come-from-behind, nearly-impossible victory for the hero in the end.  But this movie is disarmingly smart, so you'll have to wait and see.<br /><br />The movie shows us that sometimes life genuinely surprises us.  And some people have trouble moving forward if people they care about are not able to finish strong.  Some people, including both of the main characters Lightning McQueen & Sally Carrera, don't believe they can \\"win\\" if they have left other members of their community behind.<br /><br />It's a racing movie that suggests finishing well is not primarily dependent on how fast you can go on the straight-a-ways, or how much you can dominate your competitors.  To finish well, you must learn how to coordinate the curves, consider others, and sometimes completely fail and go backwards.<br /><br />Why do we go backwards?  We don't do it primarily for others.  We don't do it for primarliy selfish reasons.  We do it because we are part of a community that supports each other.<br /><br />And we do it because the process of reconciliation teaches us NEW ideas to solve our specific, personal unreconciled problems from the past.  We don't do it just for the people in our past.  We do it also because the keys that resolve our problems with our past relationships are also often the individually tailored keys that will likely help our relationships with others now & in the future.<br /><br />Or as the movie's song \\"Life is a Highway\\" says:<br /><br />There was a distance between you and I<br />A misunderstanding once, but know we look it in the eye

You've heard someone say, \\"if only I could go back in time...\\"  Well, see this movie and watch what happens as young, innocent Sarah Connors is targeted by a humanoid killing machine from the future sent back in time to terminate her.  As she struggles to make sense of the situation while fleeing for her life, Sarah is assisted by a soldier, also from the future, who volunteers to protect her and to help her fulfill her destiny.  Because this is the first movie of a three movie set, this movie is a bit darker and scarier in terms of storyline than the next two movies that follow.  *For all you guys who are familiar with the early 80's television show \\"The :20 Minute Workout\\": Bess Motta, aerobics instructor, has a starring role in the movie as Sarah's roommate.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I first saw this movie in school during AP English.  Being 4 hours long, it took nearly two weeks to complete.  Despite being 4 hours, it is probably one of a very few romance movies that I am more than willing to see time and time again.  I am currently on my 5th viewing and everytime I watch it, there is something I catch that I missed earlier and which makes it that much better.  For English purposes, the movie is filled with conflict, special effects to evoke the emotions of a scene (my personal favorite being when she leaves for London with her Aunt), and several plots which vary in complication.  Several people below have already mentioned the main plot many times, but to truely see and understand this movie, you must pay attention to all the little details.  In general this movie is about the relationship struggle between Miss Hale and Mr. Thornton in the midst of the industrial period.  This takes pleace in the north part of England where Mr. Thornton runs a cotton mill and Miss Hale moves there from the south.  But there is so much more to the movie that I would not have noticed myself had I not been in school.  One key item being the letters that Miss Hale writes.  As the viewer sees Milton while one of the first letters are written, we hear a sharp contrast to what we see.  This is a terrific movie to watch but not one for those who don't wish to notice everything.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Superman Returns makes more than just the Man of Steel's triumphant return to the big screen.  This film score is the first time since Superman the MOvie that a Superman film has any original music written for it.  Superman II, III & IV all the music was simply rehashed from the original film and even worse played with either an undersize orchestra or on a synthesizer.  Either way the scores sucked and no new music had been written.  Now, John Ottman has taken the original Superman theme and written a new score around it.  He has put in many of the familiar themes like the love theme, as well as the Kent theme, but there is soo much more.  To see what I mean check out track 2 Ottman does some wonderful things with familiar themes and adds themes of his own.  He writes a much more darker theme for Luthor and writes a powerful set of music familiar yet different.  It is a great film and after the original it ranks as by far the second best score in the series, but its a great set of music.  Ottman who has plenty of super hero experience from X-Men 2 & Fantastic 4, writes well and isn't intimidated by following in Williams' footsteps.  Well done and highly recommended.

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Pope John Paul II is probably the most famous Pole in recent history.  Before he was Pope John Paul II, he was Karol Wojtyla.  Before he became the Pope, he was an actor, poet, teacher, and priest.  \\"Karol: A Man who Became Pope\\" traces his personal history from the early days of the second world war up until the time he becomes the Pope.  His life story is an interesting and inspirational.<br /><br />The movie begins with a young Karol at the start of World War II, we get to see a close up look at the brutal German invasion of Krakow and how Karol managed to lived though it.  The arrival and occupation of the city must have been a traumatic experience, and we get to see the death and destruction the Nazis brought from the perspective of Karol and his friends.  Events in the war influenced Karol and made him decide to become a priest so he could help others.<br /><br />With the end of the war, Poland did not have an easy time, as now the Russians controlled Poland.  Priests were a persecuted group as the communists were atheists.  A spy was placed to watch Wojtyla as he was deemed to be a threat to communism.  We get to see the future Pope develop as a person and spiritually, as he touches the lives of so many people.  It was incredible to watch how all of this unfolded.<br /><br />There are several messages in the film.  One theme is life and death, as Karol sees others suffer and even die; yet he does not loose his faith.  He remains hopeful and strong in situations where others would give up.  This brings us to the other major themes of the movie: faith and love.  He never lost his faith in a better future.  We also see how love can triumph over hate.  Love can pave the way to a better future, and whatever banner hate has, it will not triumph over love.<br /><br />\\"Karol: A Man who Became Pope\\" shows us the amazing story of how Karol Wojtyla persevered from Nazi to communist persecution, detailing the incredible story of an amazing man.  It was a reminder to me that hope and faith should not be abandoned in bad times; in fact, they are most needed then.  I highly enjoyed this inspirational and touching film.der to me that hope and faith should not be abandoned in bad times; in fact, they are most needed then.

0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is a very interesting book in many ways.  I think i liked this book because it has a storyline that is like no other.  It's not the typical hero who saves the world, but a boy stuck in a life boat with a tiger.  It was very different.  <br />    When I first started to read the novel; it seemed to go on and on and on; the writer likes to use ALOT of discriptive words.  They help you get a clear picture of what is happening, but sometimes it went off track and was hard to follow. <br />    The second part of the novel was fun.  It was full of suspense to me. The story is not exactly a 'page turner' but i was always wondering what was going to happen to Pi.  Thats why i think i finnished the book so quickly.  <br />    The ending is the exciting part. But i can't ruin it for you. ;) You have to read it your self to find out what hapens to Pi and his 227 days at sea with an adult bengal tiger! <br />

B00009MGGP|5.0|I bought the VHS (cheaper) and just finished viewing this British Drama.  It was very good, a different story line and I just ordered the other two tapes in this trilogy.  If you enjoy British Drama & Masterpiece Theater, you will enjoy this one.  I don't want to give away the ending but I am eager to see the next two.  Recommend this very highly, but you must enjoy the British drama, as it is a little different than the ones in the US.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Why is David Tennent listed as first star when Christopher Eccleston was the doctor for this season? Other than that, this was an excellent season. I wish Paul McGann would have done some shows. The Big Finish audio dramas are good though.
B000E8N690|4.0|I was expecting disappointment, along the lines of the Bobby Darin biopic, which failed its subject dismally.  However, Walk the Line was well constructed and superbly acted.  Johnny Cash himself would have been proud of this work.  I would have liked to have seen all the Director's edits restored (shown in the 'Special Features' segment) and a little of the glory that followed with Cash's career progression from where this particular film ends.  Cash was clearly a special man, who became an American icon.  Pheonix and Witherspoon portrayed their characters with respect and dedication; some final, additional concert footage would have been a treat: the music was wonderfully portrayed and Pheonix captured that magic.    The Director's commentary is also a walk through history, superbly delivered.  Well done to all concerned - highly recommended!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Currently deployed, and as many can guess entertainment on the little down time we get is highly prized. Found Serenity at the base AAFES and watched it, immediately realizing there had to be a back story somewhere. Logging onto Amazon from the MWR computer I noticed Firefly, and immediately purchased it and had it shipped OCONUS to my location.<br /><br />Immediately feel in love with the story, and have been sharing it with my other troops as well. Can't believe they cancelled it so quickly, were they looney, blind, or just without vision?<br /><br />Immediately fell into the brown-coat category along with a few of the men in my squad... Once we get these ACUs off where do we sign for our browncoats?

B0002OERI0|5.0|What kind of overrated pop band is Green Day? They are super overrated with all I hear is guitars. There is not even 1 guitar  <br />solo in this album, it is just lousy. Even Boulevard Of Broken Dreams is overrated as their crappy new single. Green Day is now  <br />over, stop reviewing this terrible item everyone, go hide this in the closet in your room right now. <br /> <br />^ <br />^ <br />^ WAT KIND OF FREAK ARE YOU?  <br />first thing: green day is NOT a POP band...there alternative rock or punk <br />second thing: okay...mabye YOU think their over rated...but their really not. listen to the words to some of these songs...first one i think of is wake me up when september ends...its about billie-joe's father's death and he was hurting from it...all of green day's song have a meaning to them <br />third thing: YOU said ALL you hear is guitars...and THEN you said there were NO guitar solos... u truley are a freak <br /> <br />and this is MY opinion of american idiot: they have done equally as good songs...but these are honestly my favorite so all you haters shut up and listen to your \\"pop\\" and \\"hip hop\\" music
B0000TB05A|5.0|After dismantling the mammoth stage productions of ZooTV and Popmart in the nineties, U2 returned with the old fashioned approach to the live concert setting.Stripping away all the excess lighting and props(remember the lemon?)and not doing what other veteran bands have gotten into the habit of doing,like filling the stage with background singers and musicians.U2 did not want to to have any distractions on stage and therefore did away with it all leaving just them and their audience and very minor backing tracks.The band look and sound excellent,joking with the audience and having an all around good time,Bono even invites his young daughter onstage with him while they play\\"Mysterious Ways\\",\\"Until the end of the World\\"the song about Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Christ comes to life and out does the studio version by far.This is U2's best concert dvd to date,every music lover should have this disc in your collection.You won't regret it...Enjoy!This is probably one of the greatest concert's captured on video!

When you listen to this CD you'll realize how deprived you have been for so long. <br /> <br />Besides, you're kids will like it.  You'll have something to share.  Maybe they won't spend so much time holed up in their bedrooms and not interacting with you. <br />
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This was a great album in a time that i havent seen a good rock album since Avenged Sevenfold's City of Evil.  I like how the titles usually have nothing to do with the actual song.  Anyways lets get to the reviewing. <br /> <br />Introduction-7/10-What can you really say about an introduction? it was okay, i'm personally used to them being a bit shorter but good nonetheless. <br /> <br />The Only Difference-7.5/10-I really liked the chorus here and the verses had mostly good lyrics.  I like the speed and pace of the song a lot.  I also like the interlude in the song. <br /> <br />London Beckoned Songs-8/10-Excellent chorus and the singer's voice sounds great.  Lyrics are kinda funny and also really well thought out.  One thing that i notice a lot in Panic!'s songs is that they have really good interludes and background instruments.  The highlight of the song for me was the \\"weather report\\" interlude. <br /> <br />Nails for Breakfast-7/10-This is one of my least favorite songs on the CD.  I liked it anyway, but just not as much as i like the other songs.  I really didn't like the verses that much, but the chorus was a saving grace to me. <br /> <br />Camisado-9/10-Absolutely great song.  I liked everything about this song, the speed, the vocals, lyrics, and music itself.  Everything was perfect, but the reason that i rated it lower than perfect is because there are songs that i like more on the CD.  Another great techno-ish interlude. <br /> <br />Time to Dance-8.5-I like the synthesized guitar and the lyrics as well as the chorus.  The verses aren't too bad, in fact they are pretty good, but i've heard better so i rated it a little lower.  I really like the \\"shotgun wedding\\" part as well as the \\"photo op\\" part. <br /> <br />The Most Fun a Girl Can Have-10/10-A tie for best song on the CD.  I don't know why i like it so much, but it is just great to me.  I love the chorus, bridge, verses, everything.  All-around awesome, especially the part where everything is quietfor the chorus. <br /> <br />Intermission-5/10-i really liked it, up until the piano dragged on for hours. <br /> <br />But It's Better if you Do-9/10-Without a doubt their best single to date.  Chorus is outstanding and the background piano is great.  Verses are no slack either.  Singer's voice is perfect for the song.  I like the way it leads into \\"I Write Sins.\\" <br /> <br />I Write Sins-8.5/10-Oddly enough i don't really like the chorus as much as i like the verses.  I also gave this song a lower score because it is popular, and i tend to not like songs when they get popular.  No matter, it is still a good song. <br /> <br />I Constantly Thank God for Esteban-9/10-I really like the story this song tells.  Great musical accompaniment along with great vocals and lyrics.  One of my favorites, but it doesn't measure up to \\"The Most Fun\\" and the next 2 songs. <br /> <br />There's a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered-10/10-Great story once again, great lyrics, excellent music, and great singer.  I loved every minute of this song and woulda liked it to be longer.  Great brass band interlude. <br /> <br />Build God, Then We'll Talk-10/10-The other tie for best song on the CD.  Sweet beginning and probably the best lyrics on the album.  Chorus excells as well.  Singing is probably the best on this song as well.  I am surprised that this is not a single yet, but the longer it stays undiscovered, the better.
0743487486|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most important books I've read.<br /><br />It makes a strong case for why both punishment/criticism/consequences and rewards/praise not only are ineffective in getting kids to do what we want but also cause lasting harm to kids' development.  It provides many great insights toward alternatives, all flowing from the idea that we must unconditionally meet children's needs, that this is how we can give kids a solid foundation upon which to develop healthfully.<br /><br />Yet the book is certainly not about being a pushover as a parent.  The punishment/reward opposites it criticzes are distinguished as, themselves, just one side of another pair of dysfunctional parenting opposites.  They are just different ways to use power to control kids.  On the other hand is permissiveness, which is also ineffective.  The book makes clear that it is both possible and necessary to be a parent, to set boundaries, and that it's simply a question of how one does so, respecting kids as human beings and seeking to work with them toward positive ends rather than do things to them that can't possibly move them toward the ends we want.<br /><br />UP sheds a great amount of light on parenting, education and, if one is willing to extend its ideas, communication in general, even among adults.  On top of all this, it is an easy and enjoyable read.<br /><br />For those already interested in approaches such as attachment parenting, unschooling, positive discipline, etc., this book is a must read, giving perhaps the broadest picture possible about why these various approaches are so necessary and providing ways for people to make connections among them.<br /><br />For anyone who is a parent of a child of any age, for anyone who relates with kids of any age, and really for anyone who wants to improve their communication and their relationships in general, I highly recommend that you find an opportunity to read this book soon.
B000001FTD|5.0|Right after their release of their best album ever, \\"Spreading the Disease\\", Anthrax followed up with their equally as powerful, Among the Living. Even though this album isnt my favorite, it is widely accepted as being their best. Which isn't a over exaggeration. This album really shows how Anthrax ultimately ended up sounding. It has the most punk influence, it utilizes their signature shout-alongs, and their \\"bass-bump\\", if you will, bass lines that are so evident in their style of East Coast Thrash. This album, along with their other first 4 first albums are a MUST for any Thrasher, Headbanger, or Metalhead!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Was very well presented both the outer packaging and the inclusion of the commic.  If you like the film you'll love this version
B00027JYLC|5.0|Aren't the best shock pictures, from \\"The Sadist\\" to \\"Saw\\", based on scenarios that, just perhaps, could actually happen? No zombies or vampires, just very sociopathic, very *human* monsters. \\"Freaks\\" fits neatly into that catagory, all the while flipping it on its head entirely. You see, the freaks in this film aren't the ones who appear outwardly horrific, but rather the ones whose outward beauty hides their true hideousness. Conniving trapeze artist Cleopatra seduces dwarf Hans, then poisons him after marraige to inherit his fortune. Hans wises to whats going on, and the sideshow ensemble enact a terrible vengeance against Cleo and her strongman lover Hercules. Too bad the cut footage has all been lost. \\"Freaks\\" remains delightfully disturbing more than seventy three years after it's premiere, a living testament to director Tod Browning's skill at creating genuinely chilling movies without the gore of modern films. This is absolutely essential viewing for any fan of \\"unusual\\" cinema. This version includes both alternate endings, an informative commentary track by a film historian who sounds like he knows what he's talking about, and a one hour documentary on the real life \\"freaks\\" who appear in the movie. Now, if only \\"The Unholy 3\\" would see DVD release,,,
B000001EYO|4.0|Shawn Colvin's version of Viva Las Vegas, which seems to be the most difficult to find of the \\"missing\\" tracks, can be found on the 1995 Doc Pomus Tribute CD 'Till The Night Is Gone' - also somewhat difficult to find, but an excellent CD.
038572179X|4.0|This book was challenging but on the whole worth reading.  I see that there are over 500 reviews on this book, and I haven't scanned them all.  Therefore, at the risk of saying something that somebody else has already noted (probably more eloquently) I want to point out what I think is the main idea of this book.  The question the author is posing is whether to regard the title \\"atonement\\" as ironic or not.  In other words, does the main character, Briony, actually make substantive atonement and reparation for her guilty act merely by writing a book to be published posthumously?  The book we read here is presented as written by this character.  In \\"her\\" book, she causes her character to go out of her way to apologize to the people she has wronged for her misdeed and then suffers consequences to make amends.  It turns out that she hasn't really done any of this - her book is merely her fantasy of what \\"atonement\\" would look and feel like.  Therefore, it is my belief that McEwan is showing the difference between substantive, \\"real\\" atonement versus just feeling guilty and having reparative fantasies. By writing about it, Briony shows she knows what real atonement would require, but does not bother to enact it.  Because I work as a clinical psychologist, these issues are important and vital to me, and it points out the difference between guilt as a psychic vexation as distinct from a motivator of good behavior.  By definition, guilt causes suffering for the guilty, but it is only when the guilty person makes a reparative real act that the guilty \\"social script\\" has a healthy social impact.  Otherwise, the guilty individual, \\"Oprah-like,\\" may feel good about herself but has not salvaged her humanity

B000FGGE5Y|1.0|To start off, I liked underworld, tremors, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Blade, The Punisher, Anaconda, and even Aeon Flux. <br />I didn't say they were the greatest films, but they have something about them, that made them fun, even if they were stupid. <br />This film has NOTHING. I say again \\"Nothing what so ever\\" That is good. This is the worst film I have ever seen. It's worse <br />then Battlefield Earth, Kazzam, Knockoff, House of the Dead, Jaws 4, or War of The Worlds. <br /> <br /> <br />reasons: <br /> <br /> <br />No continuity. Ever. she kills off a bunch of guys in a hallway. Another 20 or so bust in through the ceiling, and the other doors, <br />so she turns around (casually) and shoots through a glass wall, and walks into a mall. The Guys, of course are RUNNING <br />at her, but once she gets in the no-so-crowded mall, they can not find her. <br /> <br />She is on an open stairwell in that same mall, and a line of guys are coming up the stairs, and a line of guys are coming down the stairs, and 3 lines of guys are coming into the open area below. She stops and makes a phone call, and talks about the kid's sickness, then hangs up, and it cuts to her walking across the roof with the kid. <br />How the hell did she get out? <br /> <br />Even Neo in the Matrix gets hit once in a while. Not ONE person ever gets a hit on her. No bullet, no punch, no kick, not even a lucky swing with an electric baton. <br /> <br /> <br />The film is about Mutants. she is a mutant, and so is the main bad guy. All mutants have different powers, but all can see in the dark, to different degrees. They <br />set up the fact that the Main bad guy is a super mutant. He can see in Total Darkness, as if it were high Noon. He fights her, and then turns off the lights to  <br />get an advantage. She Lights her metal sword on fire to see in the dark. They fight, and he disarms her. Now at this point the writers must have taken a  <br />break, and forgot who had what power, because now the bad guy can no longer see in the dark. He needs to use the flaming sword to find her. She, of course, <br />finds a gun (in the total darkness), and sneaks up on this guy who can see in the dark. <br /> <br />I kept telling myself, that it HAD to get better. <br /> It never did. <br /> <br />Please do not ever see this movie, if you are still considering it for laughs, it's not even worth that. The camp is not even there. You are better off  <br />watching Battlefield Earth and drinking every time the plot changes.
B000EULJLU|1.0|Optiate was a great thrashing simple guitar drums, bass, vocals EP, \\"Undertow\\" was them progressing there sound to another dimension, \\"Aenima\\" is an incredible piece of captured mixed and dark emotions, then came \\"Lateralus\\", kind of dissapointing, certainly not bad, but quite dissapointing considering how far this band had progressed, but they seemed to be taking a step down. <br /> <br />And after another long wait we have the unimaginativley titeld \\"10,000 days\\", I tell you something, you can always tell what the music will sound like on an album from the artwork and album title, and unfortunatly, the music on this album is just thats. \\"10,000 days\\" to make, and 5 seconds to name the record. <br /> <br />Another band falls down in the dust.
B000E41MS6|5.0|My husband and I have already watched ALL of these and were definitely looking forward to the American release. We love the extras, that's one reason we buy DVD's. However, I don't understand why it list's David Tennant as the star, when Christoper Eccleston clearly is the Doctor for the entire series one, umm he's even on the box. Tennant only has a few lines in this one. If you are wanting to see more Tennant, you will have to wait for season two. We bought this the second day it was out, and our 3 year old can not get enough, we have watched at least one episode a day. We only wish it had been released with the rest of civilization...why we in the good 'ol USA is a year behind we don't quite understand. <br /> <br />Okay, here's the review, it is much different at least to me than the previous Doctor Who series, which we own some episodes on VHS, and some I would rather not watch, but my husband grew up watching the Doctor and is a huge fan. I will never forget my first Doctor! I am now a huge fan, and love the new series and can not wait for more. The extras are great! <br /> <br />When this series first came out, I would not sit and watch with him, now we pre-screen the episodes, and  will sit and watch with our 3 year old son as a family. Our son acts out the scenes - sometimes he is the Doctor, sometimes he is the bad guy, and he always seems to have a make shift sonic screw driver in hand. This DVD is great for all of you older Doctor Who fans, but is also fantastic for a new generation - young and old. I can just see all those  kids who will be gripped and peering from behind the couch. <br /> <br />Here's to more! And it's about time!
0596007124|5.0|I'll be quick.     Though I have several reference sources for various design patterns in common use today, I found this one of the easiest to read and absorb. As stated in a few reviews, they don't drone on with lengthy paragraphs in a general context. Instead, in an iterative fashion, they introduce the reasons that brought forth the design pattern, provide valuable examples to reinforce the earlier concepts, and then clarify any issues that may remain.     Buyer Beware! If you have a university background and/or simply not interested in a rather unorthodox technical book with regards to its teaching methods, then I'd suggest you steer clear of this work.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I really never knew how talented Pink was until I purchased this CD. It's a perfect blend of high-energy, tough girl attitude with more emotional, touching ballads--all with that \\"edge\\" that makes Pink so intriguing.     Her lyrics are honest, and she doesn't try to be something she's not. I wasn't able to take the CD out of my car CD player for a month. There's not a bad song on here!
0316172324|1.0|I am a psychologst who studies implicit/nonconscious phenomena and its relationship to explicit/conscious phenomena. Much of this book is based on junk science.

B00005ABUB|1.0|In 1973 I was 10 years old and I loved this show so much that I secretly wanted to *be* Steve Austin. I never missed an episode and I could hardly wait the 7 days until the next episode was aired. But that was 33 years ago. <br />I found the entire series on DVD from a Canadian company, I think, for around $235. I gladly paid the price and once again I found myself waiting to watch the Six Million Dollar Man. Finally, the DVD's arrived and here are my observations: <br /> <br />First, the sound and video quality is generally ok, but some sections are bad. In fact, 2 of my discs will not play at all. <br /> <br />Secondly, and more importantly, this show is awful. I mean really, really awful. The stories are weak and stupid, and the acting and the scripts are even worse. I had forgotten about the silly sound effects as Austin did his thing. I forgot about the dumb slow motion of his running as the bad guys ran away at normal speed. I forgot how fragile Austin was as I saw about 2 dozen instances where he was tapped on the head and fell to the ground, out cold. I tortured myself through about half of the DVD's, but no more. I've had enough. My disappointment is great, and if you've matured even only a little (like me), you'll be likewise let down. Save your money and don't buy this terrible TV series! <br /> <br />David
B00028HBKM|2.0|I saw this movie twice: once in the theatre, rented it once.   <br /> <br />The movie is visually stunning, but lacks any real credibility.  If you're looking for gratuitous Jesus love, then rent/buy it.   <br /> <br />If you have actually read the bible, this movie should offend you.  It's blatant pandering to an unrealistic sense of events surrounding Jesus's crucification.  Last Temptation of Christ was probably closer to truth.
1573301183|5.0|Alice in Chains performed this Unplugged concert after a three year hiatus from the stage. Their first, second, third, and last album had already come out; It was 1996 and everything seemed bright. The band was popular, they were better than ever as musicians. As most of you know, 6 years after this was filmed; AIC's lead singer Layne Staley would die of a heroin overdose. This concert is a beautiful testament to the power and greatness of the band.  <br />In case you don't know, the band consists of; <br />Layne Staley-Vocals <br />Jerry Cantrell-Guitar <br />Mike Inez-Bass <br />Sean Kinney-Drums <br />Scott Olson-Guest Guitarist <br />and the set list is: <br /> <br />1. Nutshell <br />2. Brother <br />3. No Excuses <br />4. Sludge Factory <br />5. Down in a Hole <br />6. Angry Chair <br />7. Rooster <br />8. Got Me Wrong <br />9. Heaven Beside You <br />10. Would? <br />11. Frogs <br />12. Over Now <br />13. The Killer Is Me <br /> <br />Simalar to the Nirvana Unplugged, their biggest hit \\"Man in the Box\\" is left out. But that's OK. Every song on here is performed perfectly, it's here live that you can really see (and hear) the raw emotion in Staley's voice. While during the performances, everyone seems happy except Staley; During the places where commercial breaks are, you see that the band is happy and still have their sense of humor intact. It's funny to see Layne Staley mess up on a verse of Sludge Factory. As for the \\"Bonus Features,\\" there's a timeline that extends to 1999, but there's some interesting things I didn't know about. Anyway, this is a great concert and a great addition of the Unplugged series. <br />AIC fans will definitely be pleased. <br />GRADE: A <br />
B000F5GNX8|5.0|On the run from the law, hapless petty thief Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) crashes into a film audition and ends up with the part. He is flown to Los Angeles, where he is taken under the wing of tough private eye and moonlighting movie consultant Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), called that because he's gay. At a party, Lockhart bumps into Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a Hollywood starlet and also Harry's unrequited childhood love from back home. Very quickly, the three become embroiled in a complex, bullet-ridden case involving a murdered socialite and, possibly, Harmony's little sister.<br /><br />Shane Black (famed for his screenplays on the Lethal Weapon series) makes his directing debut and comes up with an unmitigated winner. In this lively, darkly funny feature, Black successfully integrates slick production values with a witty, tangled, self-referential script and smoking performances from his actors. At the same time, Black turns topsy-turvy several conventions in the action buddy genre to which he himself has amply contributed.<br /><br />The actors are very good here; one could sense the fun they were having. The three leads have combustible chemistry. Val Kilmer endows Gay Perry with a perfect balance of  machismo, intelligence and world-weary air. And wicked,  deadpan sarcasm. I haven't seen Michelle Monaghan before but she is a revelation as Harmony Faith Lane. Harmony is decidedly smart, is delightfully down to earth, and has had life experience. Yet, she retains a modicum of adolescent innocence. It's pretty obvious why Harry's jonesing for her. Hopefully, we see more of the sexy Michele in future films. But it is Robert Downey, Jr. who shines the most. His charisma is still intact, his wry, droll acting skills still very much present for us to savor. He's still very, very likable. I had fun listening to his dry, teasing narrative voice-over, which he delivers in a laid-back, natural fashion. I think Downey, Jr. is an actor I'll always root for. Two words: sequel, please.<br /><br />The Special Features section could have had more goodies. But what it does have is pretty sweet: A funny film commentary by Shane Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer; an outtake reel; and a theatrical trailer.s: sequel, please.<br /><br />The Special Features section could have had more goodies.

0060005696|4.0|Informative and realistic - great book!  The thing I liked most about this book was the fact that it kept a consistent theme throughout (i.e., consistent references that did not require me to search previous pages for definitions). It is true that there are a lot of choices to be made each day and knowing what type of decision maker you are can help make those selections easier and more fulfilling.  I particularly liked the way he explained the correlation of the level of regret associated with a maximizer vs. a satisficer and his references related to risk aversion.
0525948023|5.0|Eckhart Tolle came on the \\"Spiritual Scene\\" around 7 years ago with his book \\"The Power of Now\\". It was, and is, an amazing book which of course, never dates since it is all about the Present Moment. His current book\\" A New Earth\\" is quite different though equally powerful. I have not yet finished it,<br /><br />I find myself slowing down as I read to better absorb the words.<br /><br />This is a book you will want to mark up on just about every page,keep a yellow marker handy. There's a LOT of substance to<br /><br />the content of this book, it is not a \\"quick read\\" summer book,<br /><br />this is a book you will refer too for many years to come,<br /><br />his chapters on the Ego will blow your mind (Literally)<br /><br />If you're looking for something deeper then the usual shallow<br /><br />New Age fare that seems to occupy the \\"self help\\" section of bookstores, this book is a fine choice.

B00005JL0U|5.0|I first watched Moonwalker when I was 8 years old and I have been hooked on it ever since!! How could they wait this long to release it on DVD? Moonwalker is evidence as to why America fell in love with Michael in the first place. Speed Demon, Bad, Dirty Diana- Moonwalker IS Michael Jackson.  Please release it on DVD as soon as possible!!
0062515675|5.0|Love this book, putting it into practice immediately.  Told my friends and am passing it along so they too can get the benefits of the message.  Looking forward to getting \\"Who Will Cry When You Die?\\" by the same author.
0671646788|5.0|Written around 50 years ago this book still holds true. It is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success. Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim, <br /> <br />The application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within. Coincidentally this book arrived a few days before I had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind. I passed the first interview easily, nailed the second one and got the job! It's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind. It's also a book you will want to lend people you care about. <br /> <br />Highly reccommended. Buy it! <br />
B00008BXJ6|2.0|...Nobody's bothered making an AC/DC compilation! Maybe it's because they only had three Top 40 Hits (Back In Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, Moneytalks), but they deserve one. Surely any AC/DC compilation worth its salt would contain by far the three greatest songs on this album, which I'll get to in time. I'm sorry, but I don't think The Jack is one of their better songs - they didn't perfect the dirty joke sub-genre until Big Balls, so The Jack is simply an endless excuse to throw in as many innuendos about STD's as possible (granted, Big Balls is similar, but that song was quicker and funnier) - though I do like the dubbed-in booing crowd at the end. Rock 'n' Roll Singer feels like a rewrite of It's a Long Way to the Top, especially coming right after the first song. Can I Sit Next to You Girl & Live Wire may have seemed innovative at the time, especially seeing that this was 1975, the height of arena-rock, but today they're stale, especially considering the great music these five Austrillian bad boys would make in the future. Little Lover and She's Got Balls are both acceptable fillers.<br /><br />That leaves three songs: It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Want to Rock 'n' Roll), T.N.T. and High Voltage. These three are among AC/DC's best songs. It's a Long Way to the Top addresses the ups and downs of rock, with a surprise instrumental break! TNT is a hard rock anthem, has sort of a Punk feel. And High Voltage is one of AC/DC's many tributes to rock itself. Surely these songs would be shoo-ins for an AC/DC comp. but for now, we have to suffer through this very uneven debut.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the most entertaining Sci Fi series to come along since the original Star Trek. The characters are endearing and well thought out, the stories are exciting with no traces of cheese or insipid plots and the dialogue is full of heart and reality. The setting is 500 years in the future, but alien life has not been discovered yet, so it's the story of human beings trying to make it out there in the great big 'verse together where the struggle is still between each person and their own demons. There are many western settings which, until I saw this series, I hadn't realized I missed in a tv series. <br />There are only 14 episodes, however. It was cut down early to make way for more mediocre fare and I found myself with tears in my eyes as the credits for the final episode \\"Objects In Space\\" came up on the screen. Didn't think I'd react so emotionally to a tv show, but this one is a real shining beacon in the murk of trite network television. <br />I highly recommend this series! Well worth it.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin DeGraw has created a masterful blend of introspective and inventive music that I cannot get enough of. I personally enjoyed the \\"Stripped\\" album more than the studio version. <br /> <br />The heart of this album is evident all over every song. Lyrically, it speaks to me and so many others in a real way. Sure, it may have it's cheesy moments, but who doesn't? <br /> <br />\\"I Don't Want To Be\\" was so explosive when it was re-introduced to the world after One Tree Hill, that it just blew me away. <br /> <br />My favorite song in the album is \\"Over-Rated\\". It has beauty and heart. Truthfull, I listened to \\"Chariot\\" for 2 months straight. <br /> <br />Did I mention that I am a 24 year-old black kid who is in love with rock? Must have forgot. <br /> <br />But that is not important, what's important is that Gavin rocks!!!
0441009425|3.0|You have to hand it to Reynolds: he must be a good stringer-along, because I finished this book despite being irritated to the nth degree. The promises of great discoveries and hidden treasures were enough to make me put up with the obsessive repetition of his fetish word \\"flense\\" and non-word \\"disorientate,\\" as well as a simple dearth of proofreading or editing. The characters are so one-dimensional you can't even speculate what they'll do next; I was glad when one character died just so I wouldn't have to keep track of him anymore. Reading this book was sheer drudgery and not even the 2001-derived ending could make it worth my time to read any more of them.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|Star Trek V is about a man who believes he has found God and is searching for a way to get to God.  He has the power to convince people to help him along his journey.  They finally reach where God is and then reality sets in of whom they are dealing with.  If you like adventure and humor, this movie is for you.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  The picture was good and clear, the sound was good, but the case was damaged inside.  The dvd could not stay in place because the circular tab inside was missing and that will cause the dvd to get scratched.  Otherwise this is a good movie to see.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What made this season incredible was the chemistry between Eccleston and Piper.  They seem to be having so much FUN in their roles and their interaction is wonderful.  The dialogue is brilliant at times.  Well done to the writers.  The stories range from brilliant to amusing to necessary for continuity.  The final episodes of the season in particular are powerful and moving.  I used to watch Doctor Who when I was younger and this is an extremely welcome rebirth to the series.
B000083C49|5.0|Since I am a Star Trek fan, I enjoyed this movie.  I have almost completed buying my Star Trek set of DVDs.  If you like action and adventure dealing with space travel, etc.., then you will like this one.  Earth is under attack from a probe that was sent from centuries past and it is searching Earth's oceans for whales that once lived on earth.  James T. Kirk and his skeleton crew must go back in time to find two humpback whales and bring them to the future earth to stop the probe from destoying the planet earth. This movie was full of good one liners, humor, and a great plot! I have found no problems with this movie or the case it came in.  Even though I favor full screen movies, I am getting use to watching wide screen.  If you are a Star Trek fan, then you will like this movie.  The picture is clear, the sound is good, and the case is good.  No defects of any kind.  This is my favorite out of all the Star Trek series.

B00005QIPH|5.0|The first time I ever heard The Strokes, I was really interested by the way they sounded. Not being familiar with them, I thought Is This It was made many years before I was born. I picked up the disc about 5 years ago and my initial reaction was wow how did they even get signed? I stuck to listening to only Last Nite and Someday. I kept listening to it though and over time it just took over me. I can listen to Is This It? for ever. Definately one of the best albums I've ever heard. The original version was even better, the only difference being that the song Alone, Together was not there and New York City Cops was. The album version with New York City Cops is where music comes to a pinnacle. A simply breathtaking album.
0553804677|5.0|The Lies Of Locke Lamora began creating a buzz several months ago and first time author Scott Lynch sends it out of the ballpark.Stellar on many levels; characters,plot,action,and humor (I laughed out loud in a couple of places)This is ADULT fantasy not for kids.People die and when they get hurt they're in a world of pain.I for one,don't read fantasy as a rule.The only fantasy writer I make an exception for is George R.R. Martin and in a way Scott Lynch reminds me of him,so now I've added him to my list.I'm most definitely on board for Book 2 in this series!
0792157869|5.0|I don't usually care for action movies, but this one was quite good.  There's a chase scene or a fight scene every couple of minutes, and the film does a pretty good job of keeping things interesting without tossing in tons of irrelevant martial arts material (i.e. the Matrix).<br /><br />What ties the action together is Indiana's quest to find his father and stop the Nazis from getting the legendary holy grail.  Lots of secretive-type stuff goes on, which is always cool.  I did have a little bit of trouble with some of the continuity of the plot at one or two points, but I found this slight obstacle easy to overlook.<br /><br />Every now and then there's some comic relief, mostly brought about by Sean Connery of all people.  Since he's pretty old in this movie, he doesn't contribute much to the action.  That's left up to Harrison Ford, who does a great job of making you believe that archaeology professors are the toughest son-of-a-guns on earth.<br /><br />The type of action you can expect to see involves motocycle riding, fist-fights on moving tanks, boat chases, trespassing through old castles, exploding airplanes, tomb exploration, and plenty of guns of course.  The film makers packed it all in.  Very few dull moments, and surprisingly little philosophy for something with religious subject matter in the plot.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie because it's not too gross, and it's not filled with unnecessary cussing, like tons of other action films out there.  I think it's something most everybody can enjoy.  It's my favorite Indiana Jones film, and beats the heck out of the Temple of Doom.  Highly watchable, even if it's the only Indiana Jones movie you ever see.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I enjoy this movie and the whole concept behind it...while some ppl thought it was dumb (still really don't know why after reading their reviews) but it kept you entertain..<br /><br />A bit crazy trying to travel all that way to get your son but when your a parent you will do anything for your kids....
B00005JLTN|2.0|Okay, you have a great storyline.  It's about a guy who finds out the world around him is just a virtual world, and only he and a few others are aware of this.  Would this be a good thing to make a movie with?  Sure.  Would it be a good thing to make three movies with?  Uh, gee.  I don't know about that.  Can you think of something else?<br /><br />This second Matrix movie seems completely superfluous.  Okay, we KNOW the modern day world is just a virtual world now.  You can stop saying it.  Find something else to focus on.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do that.  It seems like a whole two hours of filler.  Much of the filler isn't very good filler either.  There's a dance scene at the beginning that drags on way longer than it should.  Then there's a bunch of fighting, which we saw plenty of in the first movie, and then Neo meets the Architect of the Matrix.  The discussion that follows makes me feel that there was some required reading as a prerequisite to the movie.  Then we see a reoccuring stranger lying on a cot and the movie asks, \\"Who is this man we've been seeing sporatically throughout the past two hours?\\" before it ends with a \\"To Be Continued.\\"  I didn't care about who the guy was during the movie, why should I care about who he is at the very end?<br /><br />Unless you're a HUGE fan of martial arts and technology, you won't be able to forgive the movie for failing to find anything new to excite you.  It just doesn't give you anything you can't get out of the first Matrix movie.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Hello! I don't reguarly write reviews, but I decided to start since I purchase so many items from Amazon! <br /> <br />In my opinion this movie is great for anyone who enjoys the Final Fantasy video game series. It is visually beautiful, the storyline is decent, the music is enchanting (I bought the soundtrack as well), and it's great to see all the characters from FFVII brought to life. If you loved the video game it's sort of a reminicent travel back in time as well, with a few scenes staring Aerith.  <br /> <br />If you haven't played FFVII and/or not a FF fan in general you might not get as excited as I was about this. My fiance sort of likes some FF games, but hasn't played VII himself, and I'm not sure he would enjoy this DVD as much as I. Some knowledge of the game is helpful in understanding the movie - lifestream, materia, who Sephiroth is, etc. etc. <br /> <br />Overall, very beautiful visually and aurally.

1594200823|3.0|The Omnivore's Delemma is most definetly an interesting read, learning the history of corn is much more interesting than it sounds and to understand the role the government has played in the demise of the average farmer is quite shocking.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in agriculutre, vegetarianism or organic farming; however, I would like to add on this piece of advice:  When you are reading this book, if you get to the point where you want to say \\"I get it, it is all about corn... everything is about corn!\\"  then you have read enough on corn, skip to the middle of the book and start reading when the author begins to discuss a small farm in Virginia, you will not be missing anything in the 100 to 150 extra pages on corn.
B000002MY3|5.0|What more can be said about Canada-born singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette?  She has proven herself over and over as being one of music's leaders with her overly personal lyrics and radio-friendly beats.  Jagged Little Pill is as perfect as a commercial rock record can get.  It's not only hardcore and controversial, it's more importantly marketable.  Every song here is a brilliant piece of art (speaking in terms of rock music, that is--like most music, it may not be everybody's choice), but more interesting is how Morissette sings it--the pain, anger and hurt come off in a wrenchingly shrill, nasally and sometimes annoyingly unique sound that's all her own.  Blisteringly personal and full of angst, Jagged Little Pill is definitely something everyone should swallow.

B000FILW86|5.0|I heard their last album \\"special one\\" but never owned it. I thought it was decent enough but this one knocks it out of the water. A lot more rock and power pop going on in this album. From the moment the first song starts you know this is going to be a fine album. I was highly impressed. I only own their first 4 albums (including live at Budokan) because there stuff in the 90's just wasnt inspiring. Though it sounds more modern that doesn't make it a bad thing. A great album from a great classic rock group. It's not expensive, so buy it. IF there are artists that deserve money, it's these guys. They do it for all the right reasons.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's classic debut has finally been remastered.<br /><br />Unless you live in a cave, if you are over thirty and follow rock, you are surely quite familiar with Boston's self titled debut album (1976). With over seventeen million copies sold since its release, every song on the album is a staple on any given classic rock station. \\"Boston\\" stands as the epitome of 70s AOR rock.<br /><br />The greatness of the band's sound stems from Tom Scholz's innovative guitar work, Brad Delp's signature harmonies, and of course, great, great songs.<br /><br />Scholz, an inventor and a graduate of MIT with a degree in mechanical engineering was a self-taught guitarist. He built-upon the vocabulary established by Hendrix and Clapton, but eschewed all traces of the blues. Scholz relied upon sci-fi effects and the organ to round out the sound. It would be easy for a technical wizard to go overkill with the effects, but Scholz knows when enough is enough and that less is more.<br /><br />As technically gifted as Scholz is, the album wouldn't be half as great as it is without vocalist Brad Delp. His unique smooth harmonies give the songs melody and make them lush.<br /><br />Barry Goudreau, (guitar) Sib Hashian, (drums) and Fran Sheehan (bass) round out the band. Although how much they actually contributed to both the writing of the songs and the recording of the album has been disputed in recent years. The liner notes on the remaster clears the matter up by stating specifically who plays what on each song.<br /><br />There is a reason that every song on this album is a staple on any given classic rock station. The songs all have great riffs, melody, color, and are intriguing. With its innovative guitar work, special effects, and organ solos, the album boarders prog-rock territory, but the songs are also crafted to be radio-friendly, so everything is easily palatable.<br /><br />Somewhere between the hard-rocking classic Aerosmith and Van Halen, and the power-pop of Journey and Foreigner, lay Boston. Fans of 70s metal like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, etc, may be turned off by the album's commercial, radio-friendly sound, and write the band off as \\"corporate pap,\\" but they would be missing out. As commercial as this album is, the songs are just too good to write off.<br /><br />The album's intelligent lyrics are also an asset of the album that shouldn't be overlooked. They're not really deep, or profound, but they are thoughtful. Some songs deal with universal themes. Especially \\"Piece of Mind,\\" which tackles the reasons for existence and questions the value of competition. \\"More than a Feeling\\" tries to explain the unexplainable, what it is about the things we value that make them so important. Other songs, like \\"Smokin'\\" and \\"Something about You\\" haven't aged as well and sound dated. Relics form a bygone era they may be, they are still great songs.<br /><br />Although Boston would go on to release several follow-up albums, the debut remains, by far, their best work. It's truly a classic album and belongs in every collection.<br /><br />Although Tom Scholz himself was in charge of the remastering of the debut and follow-up album \\"Don't Look Back\\" (1978) he has stated that he is less-than-thrilled with the results. He has gone so far as to call both remasters \\"abortions.\\" I honestly have no idea what Mr. Scholz is talking about or if I am listening to the same remasters as him. Both remasters sound superb.

B000EQ47HC|4.0|Boston's classic sophmore album has finally been remastered.<br /><br />Boston became an overnight sensation with their self-titled debut album (1976) which was one of the best selling albums of 1976 (as of this writing, it has sold over fifteen million copies and remains the best selling debut album of all-time). Needless to say, Epic wanted an immediate follow-up album to capitalize on the band's momentum. Not wasting any time, Tom Scholz, (guitar) Brad Delp, (vocals) Barry Goudreau, (guitar) Sib Hashian, (drums) and Fran Sheehan (bass) started work on their new album.<br /><br />Released in 1978, the two year gap between the debut and the follow-up was considered a long wait. Despite working on the follow-up for two years, Scholz, always the perfectionists, was unhappy with the final result, especially the second half. He considered the album rushed and incomplete. Be that as it may, it was still a strong seller, debuting at number one on the billboard chart and yielding three hit singles, the title track, \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\", and \\"A Man I'll Never Be.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Don't Look Back\\" is overshadowed by the debut, it's still a fine album. It's essentially cut from the same cloth as the debut. The title track is more-or-less this album's \\"More than a Feeling,\\" \\"The Journey\\" is this album's \\"Foreplay,\\" \\"Party\\" is this albums \\"Smokin'\\" and so on. The downdraught semi-epic \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is probably the album's most ambitious song and the one track that separates this album with its predecessor. While \\"Don't Look Back\\" is more or less a carbon copy of the debut, it's not quite as strong. There isn't anything wrong with the album; the songs are catchy, the album is well-paced, there isn't any filler, the production is top-notch, it's just that compared to the debut, \\"Don't Look Back\\" plays second fiddle, in terms of memorable, great songs. Boston's debut is such a classic; it would be a hard, almost an impossible task, to try to top.<br /><br />While \\"Don't Look Back\\" isn't the classic that the debut is, it's still a great collection of songs. And while Boston's music hasn't aged as well as some of their peers and is definitely dated, their good-time classic 70s brand of rock n' roll is certainly worth a spin now and again.<br /><br />Although Tom Scholz himself was in charge of the remastering of both this album and Boston's self-titled debut, he has stated that he is less-than-thrilled with the results.

It's the same music that people have known and loved for three decades, but now with a crisp, fresh sound.   <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever.  I just wish it hadn't gone off the air.
0060763280|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone, I bought the book not because we are not successful , we are very successful.. but it is more than that its the inner game of wealth meaning a wealthy life in all areas you succeed .. and you get a free ticket for you and a guest to the intensive weekend seminar on the book and it will blow your mind.. it has helped my husband and I understand eachother in many areas that in the past we have been stuck... <br />Just get the book to go to the seminar.. by the way its also incredible marketing, and sales tools!! <br />Enjoy.

B0006L0LOS|1.0|....and what I did watch of this trash was painful to watch.<br /><br />I think what really makes this 'movie' stand out as a complete flop is it's never ending corniness.. What an embarrasing, corny movie.<br /><br />I cannot believe I even attempted to watch this [...]<br /><br />This is the type of movie where you can turn it on, and at any given moment you can witness something that will make you cringe in utter disbelief.<br /><br />One example of this.... when 'catwoman' goes into a bar with that stupid mask, and asks for a drink.. she asks for a drink and it takes her no longer than a second or two to drink it.. she then looks at the bartender, wide eyed, and trying to look cool, as if to say \\"Hey wasn't that cool?? Did that not make you think I am awesome?? It only took me a second to drink that!!\\"<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this.. I will never watch the rest of the movie, it is already, no exagerations, the worst movie I have ever seen.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears has never been more controversial (or in control) of her career than displayed here.  In the Zone is a blisteringly sexual record, but don't let that stop you from adding it to your collection.  Sure, it's by Britney Spears, the infamous pop superstar known from sugary sweet pop classics like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" but one listen to the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic\\" and you'll soon forget any notions you may have made about her.  In the Zone mixes sinfully-likable pop with club-ready Hip Hop elements, and though it does have its low moments (like nearly every record by anyone has), it's in moments like the aforementioned \\"Toxic\\" that make In the Zone a worthy addition to any listeners' collection.  The ballads, like the bitter \\"Everytime,\\" are surprisingly decent, but Britney has never been a slow song kind of performer; her strength appears alongside the hottest, sweatiest and sexiest tracks, like \\"Toxic.\\"  So the infamous Britney Spears may not be someone everybody likes these days, but it's albums like this one that shows us she has the potential to be one bitchin' artist (given the right material).
B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden released \\"Piece of Mind\\" in 1983 and the big change this time was a new drummer. Nicko McBrian replaced Clive Burr and although I personally liked Burr better, McBrian is still pretty excellent. Bruce Dickinson of course returns and is as excellent as ever. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray do the epic dual solos. Finally Steve Harris has some of the best bass work in metal! There are many Maiden favorites found here like \\"The Trooper\\" being the most famous song on this album and one of the best Iron Maiden songs ever! There's also the epic 7-minute long \\"To Tame a Land\\". \\"Die With Your Boots\\" on is another awesome track as is the classic \\"Where Eagles Dare\\". This might come second to \\"The Number of the Beast\\" which is still my favorite Maiden album. Awesome work!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a must have for Firefly Lovers. The real fans must watch the series (Complete) before seeing this movie to truly appreciate both.

A great mixture of wit and emotions!
B00005JOX6|3.0|Of course Click wasn't worth the $7.00 ticket price but POTC 2 was sold out. I think it would be worth the $4.00 rental price however, or better yet just wait til it's on HBO next year.It was actally better than the previews made it out to be but not by a lot. That doesn't usually happen. It's basically just your average Adam Sandler movie, just what you'd expect from one. But I found Kate Beckinsale to be a bit annoying, she was really stressing that American accent and didn't do a very good job with it. Well, the first half wan't great but then it started to get better. It only provides a few laughs and warning: you may cry. There is a very sad part that lasts for a while. I could see the end coming though, as, I'm sure, could many other movie-goers. Well, as with every Adam Sandler movie, you know what you're getting into and you get what you pay for.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I liked this one a lot better than the original movies.  Unlike those movies that were too campy, this movie is a lot more serious. <br /> <br />Clark Kent has a real personality.  He is not the bungling nerd portrayed in those earlier films.  He actually has a bigger role in this movie than Superman.  Kate Bosworth is a much better Lois Lane than Margot Kidder and Kevin Spacey is perfect as a much more ruthless Lex Luthor.   This movie seems to revitalize the Superman series the same way as Batman Begins has done for Batman. <br /> <br />In this one, Superman is caught up in a triangle with Lois, her son and her \\"fiancée\\" whom her son refers to as \\"Dad.\\"  The fiancée happens to work at the Daily Planet and becomes fast friends with Clark.  Not to give anything away but besides Superman saving Lois and her fiancée, Lois and the fiancée have to save Superman. <br /> <br />There is a real touching moment when Lois' son draws a picture of Superman holding onto the fiancée, who is holding onto Lois and the son.  When Superman first left Earth, Lois was upset that he left without saying goodbye so she wrote an article \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman,\\" for which she wins the Pulitzer.  All during the movie she tries to distance herself from anything about Superman, preferring to cover a large blackout story instead.  Of course, by the end of the movie she will end up writing \\"Why the World Needs Superman.\\" <br /> <br />Nice cameo by Jack Larson as a bartender that shoots the breeze with the new Jimmy Olsen.  Frank Langella is also excellent as Perry White. <br /> <br />Forget all the flaws and the negative reviews.  This one delivers! <br />
B00005JOQS|3.0|Superman returns after abandoning the earth for 5 years.  Upon his return, he saves a huge passenger jet from crashing.  Of course!  Superman was absent during 9-11!  This well-done action sequence is a poignant wish that Superman could have helped us on that day.  Where was he when we needed him?<br /><br />Two Jews invented Superman in the 1930's to fight the Nazi menace.  The new Superman is clearly a Christian product.  Superman dies; a Kryptonite blade stabbed into his side helps to finish him off.  He is resurrected to fight- but to fight what?  Perhaps for our souls.  This Superman is no super hero- he is a super savior.  Villain Lex Luthor calls himself Prometheus, the human savior in Greek myth.  So, this film is in the tradition of Godzilla versus King Kong: now, it is Prometheus versus Jesus.<br /><br />I saw the film in IMAX 3-D, and there is much to enjoy to see.  However, the 3-D sequences often look cheesy, and the action grinds on.  There are many fine details to savor, to enjoy, and to discuss, nevertheless.<br /><br />There is terrible news for sophisticated Superman lovers, however.  Superman is resurrected, but Clark Kent is dead.  In Superman II, Superman gave up his powers so that Lois Lane could love him as Clark Kent.  The point was: anyone can love Superman, but who can love Clark Kent?  Superman realized in that great film that his human love could not be, and he accepted his isolated fate.<br /><br />In 'Returns', Superman himself becomes vulnerable.  Lois Lane rescues him, and resurrects him with a kiss.  Superman thus becomes indistinguishable from Neo, the  hero in the Matrix.  Superman loses his true identity- which is as Clark Kent.<br /><br />Clark plays almost no role in this well done, but emotionally routine action flick.  The unique Clark-Supie tension is absent.  Now that Superman is 'vulnerable', and wishes only to be a family man, there is no need for Clark to represent what Superman can never be.<br /><br />The passengers in the jet plane that Superman saved gave him a fascist salute in thanks.  Astounding!  They were correct, however.  Superman now represents the merely charismatic perfection that we wish to attribute to political leaders and rock stars.n saved gave him a fascist salute in thanks.  Astounding!  They were correct, however.  Superman now represents the merely charismatic perfection that we wish to attribute to political leaders and rock stars.
0143036556|4.0|I really like reading Diamond's books because they offer so much information about so many different fields. For example I knew nothing about China's industrial waste, or mining, or Australia's indigenous destruction until I read this book. He conveys so much enthusiasm for what he writes about. That said you could read every other page and maybe not get every detail but certainly get the gist that he continuosly hammers into the reader's skull. Diamond has a bad habit of at once assuming you are someone interested in chemistry, psychology, anthropology or anything else he could throw at you and at the same time assuming you have very little if any short term memory. All in all a good read even if a little senstationalistic and redundant.

B00009MGGI|5.0|you can't help but love and loathe this character played masterfully by Ian Richardson based on the Michael Dobbs Novels,although i don't wanna give too much away,this is by far one of the best political dramas that hit the bbc in a long time,and the trilogy is worth every penny!!!
B00005JOSS|4.0|At first I didn't think I'd like this movie but as I watched more, it turned out to be very enjoyable.  The storyline is, there is a two year gap timewise between two people who live in the same Lake House.  They start leaving letters for each other in the mail box and get to know each other this way.  As they leave more and more letters, they start falling in love with one another and they decide to meet up exactly 2 years to the day but the man doesn't show up.  I can't say anymore because it would ruin the end but there is a definate twist to this film and it's really worth seeing.  Very sweet film.
0684800713|3.0|I have never read any other Hemingway novels, but I have to say that I wasn't swept away by this one. To say that he is considered the defining novelist of the twentieth century, I find his work to be ordinary, with little to really comment on. <br /> <br />There are moments in the novel where one is struck by the loneliness of the lead character, Jake. This is attained through the style of prose, which is hard and straightforward; dialogue and scenery-driven and lacking in inward contemplation. This does effectively create the feeling of isolation of a character who, like Hemingway himself, has experienced the first world war and is a member of the \\"Lost generation\\". Jake finds himself carried aimlessly through Europe with characters who seem to be endlessly eating and drinking to conceal inner emptiness. Rarely does Jake contribute much to the conversation of those surrounding him, and Hemingway uses mundane or blunt commentary to track the inner workings of the mind of this disillusional man. <br /> <br />However, not much actually occurs in the book. It is difficult to press on with a book in which you realize part way through that nothing is going to happen. If you are interested in bullfighting you will find countless and detailed accounts of it; likewise if you enjoy scenic descriptions about romantic settings you will also be engaged. Those looking for a plot of some kind, or revelations explicitly written, will be disappointed. I think the power of this book does lie somewhere in what I have referred to as its faults, though, so I give it three stars and will at some point re-read it through a new lens.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|I really like Ben Stiller which is why I was so disappointed when I saw this movie.  Ben Stiller is brainwashed by Will Ferrell to kill the president of Korea and the movie is about all the twists and turns as the day approaches.  Owen Wilson is quite funny and I also loved the cameo's by Jon Voght and Vince Vaugh.  But the whole plot and story are so lame.  I think this is a good movie for over 13 but under 21 in my opinion.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore Has Repeatedly Shown himself as Disliking America, Writing Letters to Germany Literally Entitled: \\"Should Such an ignorant People Lead the World?\\"( A letter reffering to Americans), and also,and I Quote, \\"You're stuck with being connected to this country of mine, which is known for bringing sadness and misery to places around the globe.\\" While at a Public area in Britain.     Would You really believe such a guy about issues such as these? Visit this Link to see more than FIFTY Deceits from Fahrenheit 9/11.      [...]    (And Also, I Have NO Financial Gain from this movie. I am simply concerned about people being fooled by a Man who takes half-truths, incomplete quotes/facts, and twisting them to suit his needs.)
B00005JOQS|2.0|What went wrong?  The new film reverently borrows as many cues as possible from the charming first two Superman films, yet it leaves one emotionally cold at the end.  There is nothing memorable or witty in the dialogue, humor is rarely tried, and the plot fails to be either uplifting or suspenseful. John Williams' energetic score is used to excellent effect during the opening titles, but only emphasizes how drab the following film is.<br /><br />I'm no prude, yet the actions of this Lois Lane and Superman don't seem appropriate for these characters either.  They revolve around elements like a sexual fling, abandonment, illegitimacy, living together out of wedlock for several years, etc.  It's all standard these days, practically a required lifestyle for actors, yet ignoble and off-putting for the romantic leads.<br /><br />As for the lead actors, this Lois Lane is an utter nonentity, Clark Kent is performed as a technically accurate Christopher Reeve impersonation, but the Superman persona is done poorly.  Frank Langella is wasted as Perry White.  In the end, this film was earnest, but inept.
B000001FYL|4.0|This record is certainly a change from Bon Jovi's \\"7800\\" and \\"Slippery When Wet.\\" In \\"New Jersey,\\" the change was already underway. As most of you know, Bon Jovi lost his group on this record, and that may be another reason the change he started on \\"New Jersey\\" went a step further. Bon Jovi may very well have felt that with the loss of his group, things were not going to sound the same. So his best bet was to go in a different direction. And in all honesty, this did seem to work. (Interestingly, even my parents liked this record.) Moving on, 'Billy Get Your Guns' is a good and catchy opener. Elton John actually plays on this song. 'Miracle' is a bit softer, but still good; The title track 'Blaze of Glory' almost steals the record; 'Santa Fe' is a sad but moving song that is well done; 'Justice In the Barrle' continues the good pace; 'Never Say Die' is one of the record's more uplifting songs and does carry an energy; 'You Really Got Me Now' is a nice release of tension. It borders on comical, and it has a nice sound to it; 'Bang A Drum' is the last bit of enthusiasm to the record. It has uplifting lyrics and a good energy; with 'Dyin Aint Much of A Living,' the record returns to a sad, but well done tone. Elton John returns to add his keyboard touches. If you're expecting the same tone as \\"7800\\" or \\"Slippery When Wet,\\" you are probably going to be disappointed. But if you liked \\"New Jersey,\\" chances are you will like \\"Blaze of Glory.\\" While \\"7800\\" remains my favorite, this 5th record of Bon Jovi's showed that he could still make a good record under difficult circumstances.
0393317552|1.0|Jared Diamond is a biologist writing about social science in Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In a way, this book is a rebuttal to The Bell Curve; that book argued that Northern European Caucasians were inherently superior, and inferred that efforts to bring other races to equal status would only waste time and resources.<br /><br />  Diamond's book is equally skewed, arguing that Europeans have accomplished nothing to reach their powerful position, but merely benefitted from fortuitous environmental factors. Perhaps a qualified social scientist could have effectively argued this case - but I doubt that any would try.<br /><br />  Diamond makes many egregious errors, combined with clumsy oversimplifications. Time and again, he shows an ignorance of and disinterest in historical or cultural causes for the outcomes he describes; he always attributes these outcomes to technological or biological factors instead.  His interpretation of Cortes' conquest of the Aztec Empire should make any Latin American historian weep.<br /><br />  It's incredibly saddening that this book has reached such a large and credulous audience.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead are a difficult bunch to understand, accept, and ultimately profile for categorization.  A little context for Radiohead neophytes is useful: <br /> <br />Their signature characteristic has been that they have utterly refused to remain artistically static between releases, and usually effect such dramatic and fundamental changes that from album to album, they bear no resemblance.  Whether this stems from a fear of becoming formulaic, is some sort of larger social statement, or is merely an cheeky exercise to avoid boredom is beyond the scope of the review, but in any case, this idiosyncracy was most dramatically exemplified by this 1997 album.   <br /> <br />It was preceded by the 1995's 'The Bends,' a mostly traditional rock album that superficially bears much more similarity to the more recent Coldplay and Travis than it does to Radiohead's own subsequent material.  OK Computer was itself an rock experiment (and a superlative critical success), yet they nonetheless later abandoned its motif and moved to 2000's experimental and polarizing 'Kid A.' <br /> <br />That being said, 'OK Computer' has in the eyes of many (myself included) struck a balance between the traditional and experimental unmatched by their other releases.  There is a definite electronic presence in every song, lending an beautiful and ethereal ambience to the album and its material, and yet, there isn't the pedantic reliance on minimalist ostinatos and loops that often plagues more electronic music -- it is still very much a rock album.  On top of that, the songwriting is engaging and lyrical.  \\"Let Down,\\" the standout track, begins plaintively with stacked guitars and extended tertian harmonies, but slowly builds to a climax in the third verse, before finishing in a glorious electronic exposition of sound.  In any venue, 1997 or 2097, this would be a superb album, but its balance of the world of the past with which we're so comfortable and the world of the future in which we have ultimately begun to live is what makes this album an absolute must-have.   <br /> <br />Out of my collection of more than a thousand CDs, which spans half a century of the classics, I would have no trouble placing this album in the top ten.  In short: if you are willing to accept something a little different (but not too different), you will find it impossible to be anything other than simply awestruck.
B0000025DR|3.0|I agree with another reviewer's comment about the opener \\"Fire On High\\" and why it wasn't considered for compilation albums. Maybe because we got beaten to death with it as a sportscast theme. Rock fans have always used \\"commercialized\\" as a generic negative when they want to ridicule something when they don't really know what to ridicule about it. It's the whole punk cliche, I guess, when all punk music is just a bunch of dweebs who don't know how to sing or play but still want recognition. But there are still the classics like \\"Evil Woman\\" and the Bee Gee-esque \\"Strange Magic\\" which did make the hits sets. Really, there are only two clunkers on this set. \\"Poker\\", which is nothing but an exercise on how a synthesizer can be played the way Eddie Van Halen can play guitar--pretentious in its 1980s looky how fast I can play, dude crapola. And the alleged \\"country\\" of \\"Down Home Town\\", with its ripped-off riffs from Copland and its uban/ suburban snob bias against those of us who come from towns too small for high-rises and drive-by shootings. And this from an Englishman who only knows firsthand the America of arena venues and Hyatt hotels! I guess Lynne felt Sir Elton's anti-rural \\"Texan Love Song\\" wasn't enough. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Back home in Blighty, as among us Yank yokels, that's where the food you eat is grown. This album was obviously written during a dry spell and suffers from not enough valid material.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|At first I didn't understand what was going on, but at the end all was made clear, at least in my opinion.  This movie reminded me of JACOB'S LADDER, and believe it or not...the WIZARD OF OZ.  SPOILERS!!!!  In the end, you realize that all the characters in the movie are people who are standing around Henry as he lay dieing.  So he sees them and incorporates them and the things they say into his dream, fantasy, or hallucination, whatever word you want to use to describe it. It sort of reminded me of MEMENTO, also.  The reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star rating, is because it was so \\"dark\\".  I am not a fan of movies that don't have a lot of light in them.

By the time we reach Untitled 8, the bad has reached an orgyistic crescendo unfelt since Led Zeppelin unleashed Kashmir.  By the way, if you have an opportunity to see Sigur Ros live, you'll be equally blown away, especially when they unleash Untitled 8.

0684803356|4.0|In this novel the sum is more consequential than the parts. That is, if you read this novel chapter by chapter expecting to find some amazing answer or significance it probably is not there or very subtle at best. However, if you spent some time reflecting after having read the novel for a bit, then the novel has a greater deal of substance to it, mainly for the larger issue that is covered in the book-- what death and duty means for individuals in war time. We see this issue repeatedly in both the dialogue and inner thoughts of Robert Jordan, and Hemingway has a superb way of intertwining these two forms of prose and narration, something most authors probably couldn't do as effectively.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the biggest negative in the work is the depiction of Maria as too submissive and shallow. She seemingly just goes along with whatever Robert Jordan wants and is not able to speak a stronger voice against anything the characters are experiencing. Not only this, but she doesn't bring anything to any of the other characters, and has few lines of importance. Certainly, the fact that she has had a rough background and has endured personal tragedy (being raped, the death of her mother and father) plays a part in her submissiveness, but there are times that she comes across as just a \\"stock\\" damsel-in-distress type who will do anything for the hero, or, in the case of Robert Jordan, tragic hero.  <br /> <br />Robert Jordan appears to be a tragic hero because he questions many times why he is there, and why he is seeing this mission through. He goes back and forth in his conscious about what blowing up a bridge means, and contemplates the duty of why people kill when they have to in a war time setting. He doesn't appear to be completely sold on this cause in Spain, and while he seemingly never leaves this area physically, mentally he challenges the essence of being there time and time again so he can reassure himself that this is the just thing to do, and for the rightcause.  <br /> <br />This is not an easy read in the sense that there is much more to what is going on than meets the eye. There aren't big explosions every page or intense actions scenes with many fighting war; most of the action is internal and underscored. However, this is a powerful book in many points, if just for the effort of Hemingway to really get inside a protagonist's mind and show the insight that goes with it.  <br /> <br />One final note about this particular edition (Scribner paperback edition from 1995): I don't know if other's editions were the same, but there were a few typos in this one. For this reason, if you plan on getting For Whom the Bell Tolls, I recommend you choose another edition.

0739308742|1.0|The last three volumes of George R.R. Martin's fantasy epic were read by the incredibly talented British actor, Roy Dotrice. Dotrice had such marvelous range that one might think they were listening to a radio drama instead of an audio book with a single reader. With this fourth installment, Random House Publishing was unwilling to wait for Dotrice's busy schedule to open up and hired Flyboy author and seminar-speaker John Lee. For an audiobook series such as A Song of Ice and Fire, any change in reader is jarring and scandalous, but the biggest problem with this switch is that Random house replaced a brilliant character actor with a dull and unskilled seminar speaker who butchers the pronunciation of every major characters name. He also makes no attempt to craft voices for individual characters, making it near impossible to tell who is speaking. If you are visually impaired and cannot read the book itself, this is a grave injustice as this set is positively unlistenable. For anyone else, I'd advise you to read the book or wait for a proper Roy Dotrice edition. Shame on you, Random House.

0156027321|5.0|I don't know that I picked up the spiritual aspects of this book that so many other people allude to, but I really enjoyed this one! It seemed so improbable, and I found it remarkable that an author could so hold a reader's attention with nothing more than a boy on a lifeboat with a tiger. Amazing that. But I just could not put this one down, and it wasn't until the end when the \\"AHA!\\" moment came and I could sit back and contemplate what I had just read.  <br /> <br />This book was so enjoyable. A book not only to be read, but to be talked about.
0792833201|5.0|This movie came out when I was 7 years old and when your that age things tend to scare you more easily.  Well I can't tell you how scared this movie made me then.  Especially the closet stuff, the tree, swimming pools, and under the bed stuff.  What a difference age makes when you rewatch something that scared you so much when you were a kid.  Poltergeist is still one of my all time favorites.  I bet the practice of relocating cemetaries was common back in the day but now I think people are more aware of respect for the dead.  In this movie the construction companies' greed led to this families house to be haunted by many ghosts.  I love the story here and the movie is still fun to watch.   <br /> <br />The Movie: It seems that Carolanne's life force is confusing the spirits who are lost in between here and heaven.  They think that the allumination her spirit sends out is the real light and that is why they seem to be haunting her.  Well another presence (The Beast)does not want those spirits to make it to the real light so that presence uses Carolanne to restrain them from traveling to that light.  This family goes through the pain of losing thier daughter somewhere in the house.  Paranormal researchers are called in to investigate the unbelievable event.   <br /> <br />ENTER TANGINA:  This character has got to be one of the most interesting and beloved characters I have ever seen in a movie.  THIS HOUSE IS CLEAN. <br /> <br />It becomes a battle between this world and an unknown force that is so powerful it can swallow an entire house.  Just see the movie if you haven't already and have fun showing it to some young kids and let them be traumatized like some of us were.  HEHEHEHEHE
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Ron Howard has the recipe - he knows all the ingredients to put into the bowl to make a product which entertains, inspires, sells lots of tickets, and in this case cops the big awards.  It is scary, really, how a craftsman like Howard can manipulate an interesting, but in many ways unattractive story and make it seem magnificent.  The magnificence is entirely deserved, if you imagine the struggle that Nash went through, and this is the main point of the movie.  However, its entirely desceptive, when you realize that no one cares much about a story involving unattractive, boring, sick people.  So he casts visually stunning people in the leads, and voila!<br /><br />You can always count on a Ron Howard movie to be high quality, and \\"Beautiful Mind does not disappoint.\\"  I attended Princeton, studied multi-variable calculus, and took a course in \\"game theory.\\"  Many aspects of the movie were realisic, but many weren't.  Its interesting that Howard seems to anticipate and respect this, so he packed a second DVD with bonus material that includes lots of reality - from an interview with Nash, to details about how the screenplay was developed, etc.<br /><br />The real hero of this movie is Alicia Nash.  \\"Beautiful Mind\\" could have been called, \\"Beautiful Wife,\\" because it is the spectacular loyalty of Mrs. Nash that was truly heroic.  I can't imagine the character she must have possessed to stick by him all of those years.  {...which is yet another area where reality disappoints.  In reality, she was very loyal, but in fact, they did separate and live apart for many years....}.  Once again (this is why I like Ron Howard), this point is not overlooked due to the marvelous ending (Ron; you should have done it with the audience disappearing!).<br /><br />The breath-taking visual impact of Jennifer Connally, which on the surface could not have been more unrealistically cast, would appear to be entirely wrong for the part.  But Connally's performance in the role as the movie played out, made it entirely appropriate when you imagine what Mrs. Nash must look like....from the INSIDE.  What a woman.tirely appropriate when you imagine what Mrs. Nash must look like....from the INSIDE.  What a woman.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you haven't seen this version then you should. <br /> <br />The characters are perfectly cast and perfectly acted. Unlike other versions this one captures exactly what is going on through the mind when one reads the book. Unlike any other movie adapted from a book this one does not disappoint.  <br /> <br />This is by far the best adaption of Pride and Prjudice that I have ever watched.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Although I enjoyed a few songs by Britney Spears, this is the album that made me an extremely hardcore fan.  Instead of the usual powersugar covered pop in her previous albums (which I have grown to adore) this album boasts the empowered voice of a sexy young woman \\"getting out there.\\"   <br /> <br />There is a sexuality to her lyrics that I am fascinated with.  The songs, with the exception of a few, are upbeat, energetic, and FUN.  This album is the product of the adult Spears. <br /> <br />After receiving this album for Christmas 2004, my interest grew from a \\"I'm familiar with her\\" to an official fan club membership and a new obsession.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I love this album, the best of Phil Collins.  I believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut.  I know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife.  He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well.  He is a great composer.  Too bad most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his life, I do not enjoy them as much.  Once an artist becomes more Self-Actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I've been a Nicks fan since the first time I heard the highly addictive \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" in '78. I have followed her career ever since, and I feel that \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" is by far her most creative work since \\"Bella Donna\\". \\"Rock A Little\\", and \\"Other Side/Mirror\\" are personal favorites of mine, but \\"Trouble/Shangri-La\\" stands out in a way that they don't. \\"Fall From Grace\\" isn't any more rocking than \\"I Can't Wait\\", but the message is easier to follow, and the vocals are more far more emotional. The title track, as well as \\"Planets of the Universe\\", are easy radio hits, whether they made it or not. \\"Candlebright\\" is classic Nicks. Classic Stevie Nicks. We're talking \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" here!! Good song. VERY good song!! But, my personal favorite is \\"Too Far From Texas\\". First of all, I don't like being too far from Texas!! LOL!! But seriously, the harmonies, the melodies, the feeling, the vocal energy that was poured into this song, are all beautiful. Natalie Maines and Stevie Nicks need to do another duet, 'cuz that was good. I highly suggest this album/record/cd/whatever it is.
0515141429|3.0|Having seen Lee Child out promoting his current book, The Hard Way, I felt sufficiently intrigued to search out this, the first of his Jack Reacher novels. Mr. Child seemed the very personification of his main character: a man's man, Hemingway-esque; more comfortable shooting rhinoceros and chugging back scotch than sitting and discussing his books.  Hmmm. Must investigate.<br /><br />Indeed, the Jack Reacher character is all that and more.  A former military policeman and spec ops Jack Palance type, Reacher, clearly in the grips of PTSD and social alienation, is, in this first novel, on a vagabond walkabout when he stumbles into the town of Margrave, Georgia and promptly is arrested for murder. Turns out the dead guy is Reacher's estranged brother, who was a covert op for the US Treasury. This is the first of many coincidences and plot devices which stretch credibility to the breaking point, but hey, with such impressive writing, suspension of disbelief comes easily.  Even when I guessed the next step (as is readily done) there was no break in the delicious tension.<br /><br />Well crafted action scenes are in abundance as Reacher aligns himself with the only good guys in town to uncover an international counterfeiting scheme.  James Bond, played by The Rock, meets Deliverance.  Aficionados of Guns `n Ammo will delight in descriptions of weaponry, fighting tactics, and spook stealth. There are also scenes of gruesome gore, so the squeamish should be warned and set the book down now.<br /><br />An improbable love interest adds a little spice, but be advised the romance scenes are written entirely from an almost comical stereotypical male perspective, and as such are likely to be unimpressive to woman readers.<br /><br />All in all, a tightly crafted suspenseful read, worthy of the awards Mr. Child received on its publication ( Anthony Award, Barry Award).
0553804677|5.0|Excellent fun.  <br />The characters are real, the setting is beautiful and gritty, the plot both convoluted and believable.  <br />The book is like a well done rather expensive meal. Filling, rich, full of flavors, spice, and fascinating textures. The kind of meal you savor. Particularly the wit.
074327931X|5.0|I took the GMAT before and scored a 670.  That was a good score for me but I willing to try again to hit the 700 level.  I knew that I didn't want to buy any one of those myriad of books that spend 1/2 of their time telling you grammar-school level things like \\"ensure to get a good night's rest before the test.\\"  So I bought this one on a whim hoping that I would get lucky since it advertises that the book is for folks like me, good scorers who want to be great scorers.    So I bought this book and my only studying was over the last two and half weeks, 2 hours a day on weekdays and about 4-5 hours a day on each Sat and each Sun.  Included in there were my taking several complete practice tests (including the two that [...] gives you for free when you register for the test and one out of another book's GMAT CD).  I simply hammered through GMAT 800 book, from front to back, about 50 pages a day, until I was done, and took a practice test every 4 days (not taking the writing portion).    Well, guess what?  Today I walked out of a GMAT testing center with a 750.    I really like how the book is layed out.  Briefly introduces the advanced topic, and then gives each a clear example problem, several practice problems, and finally, crystal-clear explainations of the solutions for each problem.  There is also plenty of page space to write notes and to do math on, without seeing the answer before you are ready.  It is just great.    I agree with an earlier reviewer, this book does not cover a few math topics, including combinations or permutations or interest, but I used an additional resource to bone up on those three easily.  Including these three items in GMAT 800 would make a 9.9 product into a 10.    Thank you GMAT 800!
B000002J27|5.0|Humans, they are funny creatures sometimes.  The cliche is that they are at their best when things are at their worst... able to achieve transcendence with far greater ease when even mere survival seems unlikely if not impossible.  Music is general and Rock specifically are full of these moments, particularly when a band or ensemble has been written off or loses a key member to attrition and everyone thinks that they are finished and over with forever. <br /> <br />Then there is this album, perhaps the finest example of just such a situation.  The year is 1975, and to all appearances, Genesis have lost it all, just as they were about to break through to commercial success.  Make no mistake: Peter Gabriel wasn't just a frontman, he was a madman and as tremendous a visual and vocal focal point as any group then working could have claimed.  His departure left a void seemingly so great that the music press of the time pronounced the band dead almost immediately.  It must have been daunting to have worked so hard only to have the rug snatched up from underneath you because your singer wanted to spend more time with his newborn twins and grow vegetables.  They must have been terrified of the prospect that it was, well, all over. <br /> <br />But it wasn't all over... in fact, it was just beginning.  From the first notes of alternate picking from Steve Hackett on this record, they announced to the world that they weren't going anywhere... in fact in a lot of ways they sounded tighter, more focused, BETTER.  In striving to survive what might have been a crippling blow, they came up with one of the greatest Rock albums ever recorded... a classic that still stands among their best and one of the finest in the often-dubious genre of Prog. <br /> <br />Every cut here is a classic, even the sometimes-maligned Robbery Assault & Battery.  Most of the songs are like standards that people will still recognize 1000 years from now: Ripples, the title track, Dance on a Volcano.  The best of the bunch might be Entangled, with just about the most majestic & melodious outro of any song you could think of... if there's ever a Mellotron-tribute CD, that song is absolutely included, hands-down. <br /> <br />In short, this record, along with the brillant idea of drawing in Yes and King Crimson fans by taking Bill Bruford along for the tour, saved this band.  And that was no accident, because it's that good. <br /> <br />
B00009MGGI|5.0|If you have viewed and liked Smiley's People or Tinker, Taylor, Soldier Spy, you will absolutely love House of Cards Trilogy. Ian Richardson is incredible in this BBC production. All the actors are top notch.  Politicians in this production are ruthless, sexy, and self promoting. Ian Richardson's Francis Uehrquardt will stop at nothing to gain his post. His wife isn't far behind. The ending is unbelieveable. I would not hesitate to recommend this set of DVD's, a lot of bang for the money!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is definitely the best album the band has ever released and one of the best albums I've ever listened to (and I'm old!).
B000089RVX|4.0|It was in 2003, when the rock band Evanescence released their breakthrough record: FALLEN. Fame hit these rockers hard and soon the band's music was being played over tons of airwaves. Soundtrack spots for the band were placed in the films Daredevil and Elektra with the tracks \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Bring Me to Life\\", and \\"Breathe No More\\". \\"Going Under\\" landed the rock group promotional music for the fifth season of the television show Angel. It was clear that the public enjoyed what Evanescence now offered. FALLEN's music is a hard rock grunge with very melodic ballads. As part of Evanescence's own unique sound, is the constant use of different modes to create a slight atonal effect. Amy Lee has a great sense of how to use her voice to achieve melodic lines and dynamics. Guitar, bass, and drums are very rhythmic for this album giving interesting grunge effects. These qualities take away the musicality of Evanescence's original sound, but they work in favor for this record. The addition of strings to this album help in creating harmony, but this time around; the guitar and bass take a great step back in this aspect. FALLEN is an interesting rock album, but hardly part of Evanescence's best work. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"Going Under\\" <br />\\"Bring Me to Life\\" <br />\\"My Immortal\\" <br />\\"Tourniquet\\" <br />\\"Hello\\" <br />\\"My Last Breath\\" <br />\\"Whisper\\"
B00006GFAB|1.0|Heavy metal to disco to hair metal! Thats commerical! Commerical, means not music with expressions but music that people that buy what ever they hear on a pop radio. Meanless pop may live but to be mock by better music!
B000687M48|4.0|I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.     THE CD:  This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: \\"Missing\\".    THE CONCERT:  The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.    Awesome performances include:  \\"Thoughtless\\"  \\"Breathe No More\\"  \\"Farther Away\\"  \\"Bring Me to Life\\"  \\"Whisper\\"    DVD FEATURES:  This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me to Life\\", \\"Everybody's Fool\\", and \\"My Immortal\\". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track \\"Missing\\". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I finally bought this CD this past Thursday after hearingmany of my friends talk nonstop about it for monnths, and I haven't stopped listening to it.  This CD is AMAZING!!  Idina Menzel (Elphaba) and Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda) both have beautiful voices that make you go wow! after listening to them sing.  Norbert Leo Butz (Fyiero) also has a wonderful voice and plays the main guy other than the wizard.  (He's not too bad to look at either!!)  Some favorites include: <br />What Is This Feeling <br />Popular <br />One Short Day <br />Defying Gravity <br />As Long As Your Mine  <br />No Good Deed <br />For Good (this one makes me cry!) <br />This CD is a must buy for fans of good Broadway, go buy it today!!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|What a shame this show was cancelled!  Everwood is a wonderful family show that outlines the relationship between a father and his two children after the death of their mother.  Great acting, excellent script-writing, and an all-around teriffic show!  I can't wait to see the remaining seasons on DVD in the future.
B000002J1S|4.0|A great album! Highly recommended!<br /><br />  - Domenic A. Divito  (Park Ridge, IL)
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Definitely see the BBC version instead. <br /> <br />Hated hated hated this version.  Too shallow and 21st century anachronistic in appearance and delivery.  Hated the lame Sixteen Candles, sitting-on-the-table scene at the end of the movie and the vast majority of everything that came before it.  Hated the casual, everything-out emotionalism that characterizes modern times and makes this movie a disaster in its departure from the tone and tenor of Austen's work. <br /> <br />Got it as a gift so gritted my teeth through it, watching it with the very thoughtful gifters.  Thank you for making me appreciate, even more than ever, the Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle BBC version!
B0001XALTG|5.0|Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways.  The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents.  Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible.  Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick.
B000CC49MG|5.0|My girlfriend was kind enough to introduce Coelho to me by giving me this particular book. It is a book of one page \\"lessons\\" and details a warrior of light code. There were passages in the book that resonate with me still because they affirm how I was living my life. Also, some answers to some of my deeper questions on life were given, and some subjects I have not had time to think about were introduced. I love this book, and would recommend it to anyone who needs a new perspective on going through this thing called life and doing so in an aware, awake manner.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This movie is so well done on so many levels, and that's why it works.  I'll let you read the other reviews to get more detail.  It suffices to say that this is a \\"must see\\" film.  However, I'm not sure why it became a cult film.  Yes, it has great depth, but I don't think I would want to watch it over and over.  Just check it out.
B000002HIK|4.0|This was one of my first albums. I like this one a lot, but most of the album is pretty repetitive, but not as much as Surfing on Sine Waves or Chosen Lords. My favorite part is the last 4 songs on the album and \\"Start as you mean to go on\\" <br /> <br />I'd Reccomend buying this album, if your new to aphex twin or already a fan
B000092T6M|2.0|After the masters of the sword Douglas Fairbanks & Errol Flynn Oscar Winner Kevin Costner takes on the Sheerwood Forest Outlaw in 1991's \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Costner wasn't very good and he's not even brittish anyway, a Brit or Australian must play Robin Hood, there wasn't enough sword fights like \\"the Adventures of Robin Hood\\" starring the best Robin, Errol Flynn, even the Disney version is better than this. Robin Hood is like Tarzan & James Bond, There's been several Tarzans, but Johnny Weissmuller is the best, several James Bonds, but Sean Connery is the best. thats how it is with Robin of Locksley, Flynn is the best, Kevin Costner is allright
B00005Y1TL|4.0|I really like the first half of this album a lot, but the last half just seems to run together (Especially the last 3 songs). Every song on this CD would be considered ambient, excluding Green Calx, which is still a very good song. <br /> <br />If your a fan of Aphex Twin, I'd Reccomend buying this.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a fitting tribute to the man who had no boundries and it shows in his music. Thanks to Rick Rubin and his vision. The last song Johnny wrote and recorded \\"Like The 309\\" is pure magic to listen to, as well as the other 11 tracks on this somber masterpiece. A very welcome addition to any music collection. Even if you are not a fan, this is great listening and if you are a new fan, Its a great album to start with. I can't stress enough how good this album is. I bought it when it came out on July 4th and it is still in my cd player. It is my second favorite Johnny Cash album.
B00005JOQS|3.0|Of all the reviews I have read about Superman Returns, I feel that Roger Ebert's is the most accurate.  Don't get me wrong - I liked the movie...I just didn't love it. <br /> <br />THE GOOD: <br /> <br />It does everything it can to draw a direct line from the original Superman movies.  The first Superman has my favorite opening credit sequence of all time, which this film copies.  The message is clear: Superman HAS returned.  The art direction does its best to be reminiscent of the originals.   <br /> <br />I liked the cast.  Brandon Routh is a good actor and eerily like Christopher Reeve.  Kevin Spacey is perfect for the new Lex Luthor.  (Lois Lane left me wanting though - she isn't tough enough to be a reporter.)  Of course, Marlon Brando is the only actor to \\"reprise\\" his role from the first film.   <br /> <br />THE NOT SO GOOD: <br /> <br />The script.  I love the original Superman movie - so I don't need the new one to keep quoting it every five minutes.  As soon as I saw that Singer had hired two twentysomething skater kids to be his screenwriters, I knew this would be a problem.  The first superman movie was great because it had wit and sophistication - things that take experience to earn.  Instead of being witty, this movie quotes lines from the first one.  Instead of giving us new magical moments, it tries to recapture the magical moments from previous films.  The result is that this film lacks a sense of fun.  Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it is not the best filmmaking. <br /> <br />I get the same feeling from this film that I got from the first Spider-Man film and the first X-Men film.  This will re-establish the franchise, but you have to wait for the second one for it to get really good. <br />
B000FGGE68|5.0|I saw this movie and I love it.<br /><br />A sexy heroine, very tight custome, a lot of action, lot of fighting, cool weapons, cool vehicles, excellent special effects. What else can you want.<br /><br />Just Milla Jovovich deserves the 5 stars. Everything else is a bonus.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|If you like complicated plots, with multiple co-related stories developed simultaneously on the screen, and a naked portrait of an extremely important subject, then you will like this movie.  <br /> <br />This movie will require you to pay close attention to every detail, or you will be lost in the interlocking web of events. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed \\"Traffic\\", or if you like TV shows like \\"24\\" or \\"Lost\\", this movie is for you.
B0000844I8|5.0|This review is for Stargate. By far one of my favorite movies hands down. I would definately recommend it.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I saw this movie and I have to tell that I love it.  <br /> <br />A subversive, well elaborated plot, that reminds you of The Matrix fiction storyline but with a more romantic and revolutionary ambient. The struggle against an oppressive government that control the politics, institutions, and the media and creates an illusion of reality (sounds like The Matrix, doesn't it) in an fictional futuristic (but yet kind of actual) UK.
0812550706|5.0|I just ordered this book from Amazon and within a day, I completed it, and am about to finish ordering the series.  I have never picked up a book by Card before, but this seemed like a good place to start.  The characters were well developed, the story interesting and intruiging to the very end.  I would reccommend this book to anyone!  Definately a worthwhile, well-written read.
B000002HPT|5.0|Yes, this album is more commercial than Dream Theater's other albums (maybe not as much as Octavarium), but it still rocks, and touches me every time I listen to it. Falling Into Infinity often gets a bad rep, but I can't see it. I like almost every track on this CD, but my favorites are Hollow Years, Take Away My Pain, and Trial Of Tears. <br /> <br />New Millenium - 9/10 <br />You Not Me - 9/10 <br />Peruvian Skies - 9/10 <br />Hollow Years - 10/10 <br />Burning My Soul - 9/10 <br />Hell's Kitchen - 8/10 <br />Line in the Sand - 8/10 <br />Take Away My Pain - 10/10 <br />Just Let Me Breathe - 6/10 <br />Anna Lee - 8/10 <br />Trial of Tears - 10/10

B0007OCG4W|3.0|\\"Closer\\" is a dramatic film, written and based on the play of the same name by Patrick Marber. I kept getting recommended it on amazon.com, so I decided to see it on DVD. I didn't know what to think of it before I saw it, and I still don't know what to think of it. <br /> <br />Set in London, we see Dan (Jude Law), a wannabe novelist whose life soon becomes tangled up in Alice's (Natalie Portman), a waitress and former stripper. Dan falls in love with her, but also with Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he uses for his author cover photo. But Dan doesn't stop there, he brings Larry (Clive Owen) into things when he bumps into him in an adult chat room pretending to be Anna, who he sets up with her. Lies are told, everyone falls in love with everyone else, more lies are told, everyone cheats on everyone else and time passes. That's pretty much it. <br /> <br />Even before I knew \\"Closer\\" had once been a play, I could tell that it had been meant for theatre. The dialogue has that stilted, scripted vibe, and you can tell that not much has changed in the adaption scriptwise. Still, the characters are very strong, and the way they interact with each other is probably my favorite part of the film. It's well casted, but then again, if Jude Law's in it I usually like it anyway. <br /> <br />The character interaction, though really strong and interesting, is about the only thing I liked about this film. All the smut, the sex, the lying, the cheating, the swearing, the strip clubs and the upper middle class banter I didn't find very entertaining at all. Also, the characters are so flawed that they're almost beyond sympathy. Sure, thinking about it I can feel sorry for Alice, because she's younger than all the rest and probably didn't know any better, but the rest... <br /> <br />Whenever I see a film or play like this, rather serious exploring man's faults to a fault, I kind of wonder what the point is. Liars and unfaithful partners exist, yes, but when they and there motives are so meticulously explored liked this, it almost, almost seems like a celebration of these faults rather than a warning or something similar. When Jude Law's character pretends to be a woman in the adult chat room, for example, its played as if it was meant to be funny.  <br /> <br />There's a scene in the film where two of the main characters, Alice and Larry, are discussing art. They begin discussing the photography exhibition, and neither of them like it very much. Every person whose picture has been taken looks sad, jaded or depressed, but has been made to look beautiful. Alice says, they are made to look beautiful through art, but they are still sad and depressing. Who are these people, she says, who would pay to go see them? In some ways, I feel the same about this film. Great, great character interaction, but that's about it, the rest is a bit depressing for me.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I heard Corinne Bailey Rae's single \\"Put Your Records On\\" and fell in love with that song! When I went to the store, I was hesitant to buy the CD because I had only heard one song, but I'm definitely glad I did! It was well worth the price. This artist has a lot to bring to the table. She sings, she writes, and she plays guitar. This CD honestly stunned me. She has that jazzy style like Norah Jones, the soul and rythm of Alicia Keys, and a different sound a little like Joss Stone or Natasha Bedingfield, but then she adds a little of something else. Something really unique that just tops it all off. I thought this album was great. Her songs are filled with love, joy, and life. She is like a breath of fresh air. The real deal. I strongly recommend this album.
B00005JOQS|5.0|It seems like it's taken way too long for the movies to treat superheroes the way the comics do. Since the first comic was published, the heroes of the books have been handled with different authors, different artists, different styles for different times. A Superman comic from the 50's looks quite different than one from the 70's, and again different from today. Just as no one artist \\"owns\\" the Superman storytelling style, no one actor should \\"own\\" the role -- or the franchise. Superheroes deserve the ongoing life their comic book counterparts enjoy, always being reinvigorated for new times by new artists and new storytellers with fresh approaches to the material. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Superman Returns\\" is the ideal theatrical acknowledgement of this process. It's a shot of adrenaline to the legend of Superman by a storyteller (Singer) whose take on the canon is at once new and reverently faithful.  <br /> <br />\\"Superman Returns\\" is a square-jawed superhero movie with breathtaking action sequences, romance and a moral core that makes good vs. evil seem relevant rather than dated. And yet, it's nothing more radical than was being done in the 50's. <br /> <br />As a guy who grew up with Christopher Reeve's version of Superman, who spent hours outside theaters in lines for the first three Superman movies of Reeve's series, I was touched to hear the rousing John Williams score and to see Marlon Brando back as Jor-El. The story is rock solid. Sorry to the filmmakers of Superman III, but this is what Superman III should have been. <br /> <br />I loved all the actors, including Brandon Routh, who does Superman justice in all the right ways and who I sincerely hope will be back for the role in the next outing. And I sincerely hope we don't have to wait long for it. I can't be more ready for the film I will consider \\"Superman IV.\\" <br /> <br />Couldn't recommend this more highly.
0783240287|1.0|I put 1 Star sonce Amazon doesn't have 0 Stars. <br />Our high school production was at least 10 times better. I threw away this DVD.
0790731479|3.0|I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment. <br /> <br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but.... <br /> <br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have \\"Special\\", \\"Extra Special\\", \\"Extra-Extra Special Extended\\", and \\"Ultimate\\" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.  What's it going to take, Warner?  A bio-exorcist?? <br />BEETLEJUICE <br />BEETLEJUICE <br />BEETLEJ....  SPECIAL EDITION, PLEASE!!
0812550706|5.0|Winner of the Hugo and the Nebula Ender's game has become a Sci-Fi classic. Many people dislike Card because of his political and religious views, but I prefer to keep an authors works separate from his beliefs.<br /><br />Ender's Game was originally written as a short story and later expanded into a novel. It follows the sory of Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, a boy of 6 years, who is mankind's last hope to lead them against the \\"Bugger\\" threat. It is a moving and at times very sad story of what one little boys is put through for the good of the world. The book also includes one of the coolest names ever, Mazer Rackham. At about 320 pages its not overlong, and was a fun easy read, while still doing a tremedous job of exporing Ender's character. Card wrote a series of sequels to this book as well as a spin off written from the viewpoint of a supporting character.<br /><br />9 out of 10
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I've never heard of Sufjan Stevens until recently, when one of his songs was played on an independent radio station in Seattle. I was absolutely captivated and had to hear more. I bought the album and was so impressed. This man can play every instrument and has a quiet, lullaby voice. He is pure talent and I enjoy his music everyday. If you like musicians who experiment with style and are thoughtful lyricists - this album is for you.
0385338082|5.0|I adored this book.  I really liked the first three Shopoholic books (the fourth wasn't my favorite) so I thought I'd give Ms. Kinsella another try. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />The protagonist, Emma Corrigan, is very likable.  The plot goes full-circle. <br /> <br />There is just nothing wrong with this book except it's hard to put down.
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is somewhere between an adventure tale and an allegory. Pi sets out with his family on a boat, which wrecks. His father's zoo animals ride the lifeboat with him for almost a year, sort of.<br /><br />Yann Martel, a non-Desi, did a good job examining the vagraties of life in India and as an Indian, but not perfect. His take on the language in the prologue is amusing but incompletely correct. I felt that some of Pi's reactions were more Western than those of a young boy raised in Pondicherry, Madras, India.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book and enjoyable. It should not be read as a glimpse into Indian culture but as an enjoyable fable.<br /><br />Minna
0060755598|5.0|I found several very helpful concepts in this book, which in my opinion make it well worth the cost.  The author does promote the \\"franchise\\" model, but states that readers do not have to actually franchise their business, but they must think about their business as if they were going to franchise it.  His point appears to be that what business owners must do is develop the business into a model that could, if desired, be replicated.  This inherently requires a discipline about the business that will substantially improve it.
1400096936|5.0|I loved this novel.  Its gritty, understated and violent theme explode from the pages.
0399230033|3.0|The book is very colorful and well illustrated, but there is almost nothing to the story for younger kids. There are so few words and you need to flip through 4 pages of illustrations in some cases. Older kids should be able to read into the illustrations and enjoy the story, but this is not a good book for reading to an infant or young toddler.
B00082IJ08|5.0|A friend of mine bought the CD and told me I had to listen to it. I borrowed it not really expecting much. My only exposure to Gorillaz had been Clint Eastwood, which I think is an awesome song. I took the CD home, didn't listen, then I popped it into the CD player on my way to return it to him. I had not heard any of the songs on the radio at this point. I was compltely blown away. Not only do I now have the CD, but the concert DVD as well. An excellent piece of music and much better than anything from the treadmill of music we have to listen to these days. <br /> <br />Check it out.
0553801503|2.0|Prior to the most recent installment, I considered \\"Ice and Fire\\" to be one of the finest fantasy epics.  I was, therefore, salivating with anticipation when I began reading \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  After the first 25 pages, I found myself becoming bored by the lack of any meaningful events or character development.  Surely it will get better, I thought.  Another 50 pages later and my impression was unchanged.  300 pages later I found my pulse never reached a level above 75 (from my baseline of 70).  The obituary section of my local paper was more interesting than this.  I refused to finish the remainder.  If the author can't hook the reader's attention after nearly 400 pages, then he has failed, and failed miserably.  If you are a serious fan of this series, I strongly recommend quitting while you are ahead, because otherwise you will be so disgusted that your entire memory of how good the first 3 books were will be tainted forever.<br /><br />Edit: (12/10/08) This review was found to be helpful 5 out of 10 times just a few weeks ago.  Amazon has changed that to 0 out of 5.  I'm assuming it is a mistake on Amazon's part, and not Amazon intentionally trying to reduce the impact of negative reviews.<br /><br />Edit: (3/11/11) Looks like Amazon has corrected the above mistake.
B000002KAT|5.0|I highly recommend this album. Van Morrison appeals to me personally because his music can be very versatile. Like most everyone, before buying this CD I had known Brown Eyed Girl, Domino, and a few of Van's more widely-released songs. I was surprised to listen to Astral Weeks, though, because it is so much more intimate and personal.    Van Morrison's music reflects an interesting mix of rock and jazz, which accounts for much of the versatility of his released work. This early album especially has clear jazz influences and an improvisatory nature. As a music lover, I think it has a very unique and pleasant sound. The album's instrumentation includes flute, strings, guitar, acoustic bass, and drums, and combines with Van's unique vocal style to produce a variety of moods and emotions on the CD's eight tracks. I enjoy the whole set, especially the first five songs; in fact, \\"Sweet Thing\\" is probably one of my favorite songs ever.    Overall, this CD comes highly recommended. With downloading so integrated into our society, sometimes it is nice to buy and have a complete album in hand--Astral Weeks should be that album. Each song is great, and combines with the others to create an even better album. Van Morrison aficionados or amateurs can all appreciate this unique collection.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A great follow up to the series. I wish there was more!
B0000AOV85|5.0|Beautiful documentary, very well done.  It was interesting to see Gilmour, Waters & the gang discuss how they went about putting together one of the greatest albums ever.  I also appreciated the additional commentary from Alan Parsons (who actually plays the soundboard in the film) and Rolling Stone Senior Editor David Fricke who discloses many facts about the band and the production of the album itself.  This is a must-have for any aspiring musician or recording artist, or any fan of Pink Floyd.
B00000253N|4.0|This is by far Dylan's best recording.  It has some of the most beautiful songs ever recorded.  MEET ME IN THE MORNING, BUCKETS OF RAIN, SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE are all perfect.  Then there is TANGLED UP IN BLUE & SHELTER FROM THE STORM.  Enough said!!    There are so many great songs from Dylan from his first album to his latest couple of cd's.  The song SUGAR BABY is my favorite.  I do have a hard time listening to any of his albums all the way through though because of filler.  I had to make my own Dylan compilations & ipod collection to get rid of all the filler.    But if I could only pick one original Dylan recording to have for the rest of my life, I would definitely pick Blood On The Tracks.
B000FA57RG|5.0|So Many people are Comparing Madonna's \\"Tell you a secret\\" Documentary to her \\"truth or dare\\" documentary and most are saying that they like truth or dare better. Thats really a shame and shows you the negative state that the world is in these days(which \\"secret\\" actually seems to address). First off these documentaries couldnt be further apart but I think the new Documentary really shows how far Madonna has Grown Both Professionaly and as a Human Being. truth or dare , while Yes, in some ways was More entertaining and yes was more comical, also showed what a Spoiled, Immature and Inconsiderate  person Madonna was back in those days. Dont get me wrong, I have always loved Madonna but  back in her early days, she wasnt a nice person and she admits that herself. The New Movie has alot of special moments, Madonna, with her children, husband, father are really great moments that show a tender side of Madonna. and While some people are turned off by Madonna's talking about kabala, I find it fascinating how religion has changed this woman and I think that at least with this Documentary, madonna does have something important to say and that there are a great deal of Positive messages in this film as aopposed to truth or dare. My favorite part of the film is when Madonna is in a prayer circle for  her last concert with her dancers and she talks about how one of the dancers(i think his name is sean) she actually cut during the auditions but when she saw him crying in the hallway, she changed her mind and hired him for the tour, that one act right there shows you how far she has come as a human being, the old madonna never would have done that. In fact, in truth or dare, she didnt seem to care about her dancers at all, usually berated and made fun of them(a couple of the dancers in truth or dare actually SUED madonna because she didnt pay them for the documentary footage), she treats her dancers alot different in this film. I also like the part when during  one of her concerts she Praises MICHAEL MOORE and dedicates a song to him, this was brave to do because back in 2004, it was risky to praise Michael Moore During a Concert, Linda Ronstadt did the same thing and got kicked out of the Las Vegas Hotel she was playing at! it doesnt surprise me that this dvd/cd hasnt sold well(debuted on billboard at #33 and in its second week plunged to #107) while the truth or dare dcoumentary  was a huge hit. lets face it sex and sleaze will always sell. This Documentary, all you get is positive messages and Spiritual growth, Oh well!
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Outside of the TV commercials and movie trailers, I knew nothing about this film. I didn't even know it was taken from a comic book. Okay... color me ignorant. What I did know was that it had a very cool trailer, Natalie Portman starring, and the Wachowski brothers (\\"The Matrix\\") were behind it. As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. \\"V\\" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with \\"V\\" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from. The action sequences (minus the beginning explosions and Big Ben being blown apart at the end) were downright dull and a let down from previous Wachowski films. Is it possible to go into a movie with NO expections and come out with even less? My wife and I frequent the movies... and honestly, \\"V\\" is the worst movie I've seen in 2006 (so far). Warning - rent before you purchase.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|\\"Emily\\" gives the impression of being a courtroom thriller based on a true story of exorcism-gone-bad.  In this case, a noble if small-town priest played by Tom Wilkinson (\\"In the Bedroom\\") tries to drive out a mob of nasty Latin-speaking demons from the mortal form of Emily Rose...or so he says once he's charged with negligent homicide following her death.  Laura Linney is the up-and-coming attorney assigned to defend him.  A non-believer herself, Linney's courtroom adversary (a shockingly aged Campbell Scott) is a small-town prosecutor whose devout churchgoing makes him more disposed to hanging the priest than sparing him.  Back-tracking with witnesses, we see the horrific visions suffered by Emily - was she an epilectic/psychotic as proposed by a prosecutor's expert witness (Henry Czerny), or is this \\"the real deal\\"?  Linney's case is the priest, but her actual client is the Church itself, and the archdiocese wants the case settled quickly, with no question of the accused priest testifying.   <br /> <br />In that vein, \\"Emily\\" could have been an effective courtroom drama, one exploring the ethical implications of being the attorney for both a Church and one of its cast-out members at the same time, and leaving enough room on the subject of the supernatural so that we could go either way.  However, though making inroads in that direction, \\"Emily\\" decides to go the Hollywood route - Linney gamely goes after an impassioned defense, and more critically, the film leaves little doubt of where it stands on the authenticity of the supernatural - when Emily sees something, we see it; and when soembody else sees Emily (but presumably not her terrifying visions) we see her visions anyway; The priest has some visions as well, and the script never considers making Wilkinson's character unsympathetic enough to doubt.  Finally, Linney has too many of her own episodes at \\"The Witching Hour\\" (3 AM, if you must know), which include a locked front door that is nevertheless wide open and a dictaphone that plays by itself.  \\"Emily\\" is definately a chiller... <br /> <br />...that manages to work.  Though using a fair amount of CGI and other effects, \\"Emily\\" remains on top by its use of effective pacing and its resolute intentions to remain first and foremost a movie about people who are in fear rather than fear itself - everybody looks like their scared, and the script gives them adequate reason to, so why shouldn't we.  Ironically, the movie is almost at its scariest when asking us to ocnsider Emily's condition as purely rational - meaning that it's entirely reasonable for her (and us) to be forced into all manner of painful and bone-breaking contortions while her pupils dilate and her mind is full of visions of demons.  \\"Exorcist\\" was scary enough when we thought it was fiction, but scenes of Emily lying on the floor, her limbs in odd directions, suggest a colder and clinical diagnosis for which there is no salvation or the protective cushion of CGI.  Though no horror film has yet topped \\"Exorcist\\", \\"Emily\\" remains a movie about demonic possession that actually grabs you.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is my favorite band ever (Drivin n Cryin is close) and I love 95% of their songs.  I like the other 5%.  With that said, there are about 8 songs off of Physical Graffitti that are in my top 20 favorite Zep songs.     IN MY TIME OF DYING  THE ROVER  CUSTARD PIE  TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT  TEN YEARS GONE  THE WANTON SONG  SICK AGAIN  KASHMIR    Then there are a couple of songs that are more experimental that no other band could even think about doing so wonderfully.     DOWN BY THE SEASIDE  IN THE LIGHT    Even the lesser tracks I didn't mention have a wonder.  Bottom line: Best ever by anyone!!!!!!
B000EHSVOG|3.0|I was traumatized by this movie as an eleven-year old girl who was dragged to it by her mother, who wanted to see it because all her \\"boyfriends\\" (Newman, McQueen, Chamberlain) were in it.<br /><br />My husband asked me to get this DVD for him because of all the extras on it, which I admit were pretty good.  For older kids and adult fans of \\"disaster\\" flicks, this is one of the better ones.  The movie takes on new significance post-9/11.
B000002HPT|5.0|Falling Into Infinity was Dream Theater's 4th studio album, 5th if you count the excellent A Change of Seasons EP.  Released in 1997 during a time of tumult between the band and their record company, it's almost universally slagged by fans of the band and critics as their \\"sell-out\\" album, among other reasons that their usual font didn't appear on the cover the album! (I'm serious....). Also, because only 2 of the songs exceed 10 minutes, many fans also see that as a sell-out.  So with all these negativity, is the album any good?  In a word, YES! <br /> <br />It opens up with New Millennium, an 8 minute piece of poweful, tight prog rock that's driven along by bassist John Myung's relentless Chapman Stick playing (if you don't know what that is, look it up!).  It's a great song, and contains, to my knowledge, the only use of the word \\"baby\\" in any Dream Theater lyric (not counting the word \\"babe\\" in Take Away My Pain, which I'll get to later).  This is followed by the weakest song on the album, one most fans and the band themselves hate the most, You Not Me.  The reason for this hatred is that DT were forced to work with outside songwriter Desmond Child, who wrote the ghastly and awful music for Aerosmith from their 1980s comeback on.  He bascially re-wrote a lot of the music and lyrics and turned it into 4 minutes of dreck, listenable, but dreck nontheless.  However, this is soon made up for with Peruvian Skies, an excellent, slow-burning metal song that becomes a head-bang fest towards the end.  The lyrics concern a young girl in Peru who is beaten by her father from a newspaper article John Petrucci had read.  Hollow Years, a moving and beautiful power-ballad type song, follows.  Burning My Soul and the instrumental Hell's Kitchen had been written as one long song but are split up here at the record company's request.  Both are excellent, however, and segue into Lines in the Sand, 12 minutes of awesome prog-rock.  Take Away My Pain, mentioned before, is John Petrucci's tribute to his father, who had died recently (the \\"babe\\" previously alluded to in the lyrics being his dad's nickname for his mom).  Just Let Me Breathe is excellent, and Anna Lee is another ballad type about a young girl who is molested by family members, from an article singer James LaBrie had read.  The album concludes with the 13 minute Trial of Tears, which is ethereal and magical in places and pure DT prog in others.  It's a fantastic song and a fantastic ending to this album. <br /> <br />While this album may indeed be DT's weakest (except for their first one, which is hampered by the production and the original singer!), that doesn't mean it's BAD.  It's not, it's great, and definitely a worthy addition to their cannon and one you should seek out to listen to!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox, in it's infinite wisdom, always seems to cancel their best shows, this is one of them. I was not a buffy or angel fan, yet I now appreciate Joss Whedon's genius
B00028HBKM|2.0|I waited some time to watch this movie, and after watching it for the first time I don't think I will be watching it again. The way Mel Gibson decided to depict Jesus of Nazareth's suffering was so grotesque I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen. The story is, don't get me wrong, one that must be told. A story of one man that was killed in order to save the human race is extremely courageous. The whole time Jesus of Nazareth was being tortured he was asking that his punishers be forgiven, something that no one but Jesus could or even would do. The entire movie I felt myself hoping that Jesus of Nazareth would be let go, but like the movie Titanic, I knew how it was going to end going in. In the end I do think that Mel Gibson did seem to take it a step further and maybe go over the line. Many scenes were entirely too gruesome, but the point was really driven home, one man suffering for an entire race. The way people were killed in those days are a far cry from the lethal injections today. Those same injections that have been called cruel and unusually, to me a needle would be a much better way than Jesus of Nazareth went out in this movie. Lastly the entire movie is in English subtitles and that did take my eyes off of the scene to figure out the translation of the conversations. Overall the movie as very well done but the fact that this movie put images in my head, all of which are horrifying, is not a good thing.<br /><br />Brian Bowen
0060512806|3.0|I loved the WWII half of the book but just couldn't get into the modern part.  I understand why techies probably love it but being an IT naif I can't share in their enjoyment.  To pick a nit the book points out that people with access to MAJIC and ULTRA couldn't serve near the front and then puts a group of them behind enemy lines repeatedly as part of an allied disinformation effort.  I loved the ending on Fort Drum, the concrete battleship in Manila Bay.  The half I liked was great.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I don't really know what else to say but this CD amazing. It has some songs that make you want to dance, some songs that help you relax, and some songs that you cannot live without. If I was to invest my money somewhere it would be in Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Fox, in it's infinite wisdom, always seems to cancel their best shows, this is one of them. This film would not have been made were it not for the fans petitioning. I was not a buffy or angel fan, yet I now appreciate Joss Whedon's genius
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This has to be Robert Downey Jr's best acting to date.  He looks to be in the best shape of his life.  Val Kilmer hasn't been this funny since Top Secret.  You can tell the actors in this film really had a good time; it shows in their performances.  This is one of the best movies of 2006 in my opinion.  I enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end.  This is the kind of film making I'd like to see more of.  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang combines numerous movie genres so well it ends up being new and refreshing.  It's a perfect example of what can be done with a little imagination; something sorely lacking in the majority of movies coming out these days.  5 stars for excellent performances and a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Robert Downey Jr is an acting genius.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This has to be the funniest and most entertaining collections I have ever watched. We had seen it on PBS a couple times and it never grows old.  Just great humor!
B000002J0B|5.0|Many people consider 4 their greatest, but I think it is only because of the radio play and commercial success of that album. Which is fine 4 is an unbelievable album. But, Houses of the Holy shows all of their talents and songwriting ability. It's a rollercoaster ride of an album. I consider it one of the top 5 albums of all time! It's just that good.<br /><br />I have been listening to Zep since I was able to walk and this album get's me just as excited today as when I was in diapers (minus the accidents!).
0062515675|4.0|Someone once said \\"You cannot teach anything new to a person unless they know it already\\". This is what exactly Robin did in this book. He brings out your innerself out and make you realize that you can accomplish what you really want and your passions.  <br /> <br />I would sincerly suggest reading this book for any one.
0765315246|4.0|If you're attracted to this book because of the hype that cites it as being so much like Heinlein's work, don't read it. Instead, read it because it is a very good book. The characters are Heinlein-esque, but the story doesn't have the social and political commentary that permeates all of Heinlein's novels, and so anyone who is expecting those qualities, will be disappointed. <br /> <br />However, you should read this book. It is a very good novel, and well worth the other praise it has received. It is a thoughtful look at abilities and insight gained through experience, as opposed to the limitations of youth with its consequent inexperience. Here, a retired man or woman can enlist for a ten-year stint in the Colonial Defense Forces. They are made young again with engineered better-than-human bodies. In return, these soldiers will never return to Earth and will spend the next ten years fighting aliens for the right to colonise other worlds. <br /> <br />Scalzi doesn't examine the implications of the old given new bodies, the impact this would have on their view of themselves, or the colonial societies' reliance on military protection. It wouldn't have taken much to give this novel that additional layer, and for that reason, I'm only giving it four stars.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I think that to give a good review, you need to get past the emotion of finally getting this long anticipated video, so I watched both of these discs twice.  The second viewing allowed me to get past the \\"Wow, this is cool!\\" factor and really look at  the product.<br /><br />I can say that the audio quality is first rate. There is a unique type of 5.1 reproduction that can be set-up where it has a higher bit rate, along with the normal 5.1 and of course basic stereo. The narrative in the DVD case explains that the higher bit rate 5.1 can give higher quality, however it might not be supported by older equipment. My 3-year-old Sony DVD player and new (less than 6 month old) Sony digital receiver seem to support the higher bit rate, and since I could switch back and forth between both 5.1 effects via my remote during play, I could tell some subtle differences, but it did not have enough of a change to make me feel that there is any less quality from the standard 5.1 rendering. Regardless of which set-up you use, the sound is fantastic. My rear speakers stayed busy and the sound did that classic \\"Pink Floyd\\" transition from side to side and front to back with perfect smoothness. When in the middle of \\"Learning to Fly\\" an aircraft in the stage screen video comes right at the camera and passes from front to back, the aircraft sound transitions from speaker to speaker in a way that makes you believe the plane flew through your living room and exited out the rear wall.<br /><br /> It was on the second viewing that I found that yes, while the sound is great; there is a weakness in the visual department. The quality of the video is fine, but the things that are presented are lacking for two reasons. First, except for a few times, the camera work is too kinetic. It is as if there was a 10 second rule... no static shot for longer than 10 seconds... really, try counting to 10 (or even 5) during any part of the film. You just start to watch Gilmour tear into a solo, and then they change the image to the back-up singers who are only swaying while not actually singing. Or they do some bang, bang, bang thing where they go drummer, bass player, back-up singer, guitar, drum, horn, all too rapidly to appreciate the actual skill of the person that should be getting a long single framed shot at that specific time. The other problem is that the band is playing in a giant venue and there is a terrific light and laser show going on that encompasses the entire arena. There is no way to experience the effect that the audience was seeing on a T.V. screen, yet the video keeps trying by putting too many long shots, where the band looks like ants and the screen is washed out with strobes and laser beams. The resulting effect is one that both takes away from the musical performance while rendering the light show as a small unimpressive thing. I want to see Pink Floyd up-close and on full screen, not the view that the people in last row had. There was way too many of these long shots, and often right when you would wish to be watching the actual musicians produce that great sound. If there was ever a case for the multiple angle potential of the DVD, this would be it. They had the footage, so allow the viewer to watch what they want, a close-up of the band or tiny ants that you are told are Pink Floyd washed out in a light show. In the future I can see myself putting this on as a music only DVD (with the T.V. turned off) quite often and enjoying the sonic experience without the jerky camera work.<br /><br />There are a lot of extras, many that will only be watched once I assume. One of the better ones is the band being inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame, where Billy Corgan gave the testimonial and also played rhythm guitar on a nice stripped down version of \\"Wish you were here\\".<br /><br />Overall, the show was very good. There are several times when you feel the absence of Roger Waters, especially in light of the band's reunion for Live 8. It was almost painful to watch \\"Comfortably Numb\\" where they used multiple singers and some electronics to do Roger's part. This might have been O.K. in 1994, but since the DVD of the full group from a year ago can be had, the 1994 performance pales until the Gilmour vocals and the great guitar work come in. In the hierarchy of what `Floyd fans have on DVD, this probably falls below that 20-some minutes from Live 8, and because of the audio quality above \\"Live at Pompeii\\". Still, it is nice to have this set after so long a wait.. It was almost painful to watch \\"Comfortably Numb\\" where they used multiple singers and some electronics to do Roger's part. This might have been O.K. in 1994, but since the DVD of the full group from a year ago can be had, the 1994 performance pales until the Gilmour vocals and the great guitar work come in.

There is a fantastic elevator scene and the fact that it was made so long ago makes it a bit of a novelty for science fiction fans.  I'd compare it only slightly to Killer Klowns from Outer Space or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.

0975991477|5.0|Although I have come to realize the power of our thoughts in creating the lives we lead, I had no idea that this concept could be \\"proven\\" through science.  And yet, Bruce Lipton has provided the evidence of such \\"proof\\" through cellular biology - how our cells behave & what the results of those behaviors are.<br /><br />It's said that we can learn a lot from nature - from seeing the interaction of various animals, insects, plants/tress & such - and, after reading \\"The Biology of Belief\\", I can see how we can also learn much through the study of cells - how they interact and create their environments.<br /><br />Much of this book deals with providing a framework for understanding cellular biology, and I must say that the author does and excellent job of making this subject not only easy to understand, but also interesting at the same time.  Then towards the end, Mr. Lipton uses the information gleaned from his experiments with cells to show the amazing impact our everyday thoughts have on the lives we lead, and our environment (Earth) as a whole.  He then shares how his findings led him from being an agnostic, to one who believes fully that our spirits/souls continue to exist even after our bodies have died.<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"The Biology of Belief\\" to be an interesting, thought-provoking book.  As such, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the sciences, as well as those interested in spirituality - I think this book has much to offer.  An open mind is a must.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|This, apparently the last for the Straits, shows early in which direction Mark Knopfler was headed, and it's a good direction. In a class by itself, this album does not have the melancholy tone of \\"Brothers In Arms\\" nor the clinical perfection of that work. Every one of the songs on \\"On Every Street\\" transpose well to the concert hall (not that Dire Straits' other stuff doesn't also; I just see this entire album on stage). \\"Calling Elvis\\" - which I didn't think I was going to like - is a dancy creation that has become a favourite; also, the title tune (the end run of guitar is hypnotic), the haunting, catchy \\"When It Comes To You\\", the dark,yearning-but-relieved \\"Fade To Black\\", the waggish snideliness of \\"My Parties\\" - I read somewhere that Mark thought this was something of a one-laugh joke, but I find it amusing after a LOT of playing. \\"Ticket To Heaven\\" shows his propensity to go out on a limb lyrically. There is a heavy bend towards country here, but a lot more is brought to the genre through the music on this disc. Overall this is my favourite Dire Straits album, 'Brothers In Arms\\" and \\"Love Over Gold\\" notwithstanding.
B00005JP0A|5.0|After reading most of the Book, I was anxious to see comparisons between the book and its Movie Version!  <br /> <br />Besides lots of similiarities, the biggest improvement in the movie version, came in the second-half, when the fashion try-ons were conducted by the Staff and one observed the nitty-gritty of Tucci and Company, either concurring with Miranda or daring to risk their personal opinions in the light of their Witch-Bitchy Boss!  <br /> <br />It appeared to me that that marvelous portrayal of Miranda by Meryl Streep at times, allowed you to see the more human side of Miranda in an occassional slip over into her inner positive aside that was tinged with a bit of good humor instead of evil deleriums! I was in total awe of Meryl Streep's magical innuendo-filled performance of Miranda's layers of caustic comments and fatalistic asides to a slightest whim towards her employees!  <br /> <br />Near the ending month, as she personally quizzed Andrea what she was interested in doing next, she gave Andrea her greatly  surprising appraisal of \\"being reasonably competent.\\"  Then she volunteered the offer to make a personal call to the New Yorker Magazine! I was hooked in that being blanked-out in my memory of hearing the conversation at the noisy THEATER. All in all a worthwhile 7 stars for my rating, with a few positive accolades in undercurrent layers with relationships for Andrea with Emily And Actor Stanley Tucci! Joyfully Shalom, Retired Chap Fred W Hood
B00005JOQS|2.0|I had real trouble with this.  We'll start with Brandon whomever.  He may look like Christopher Reeve, and he may sound like Christopher Reeve, but there the similarity ends.  He came across as dumb as a stump with about as much personality as a tree!  And then there was the script.  Why did he have to crash land on his mother's farm it he can fly all over the galaxy?  Why, if Lois Lane was thrown all over the plane, did she emerge without a scratch on her?  I could go on throughout the entire movie like this, but you get the picture.  Otherwise it was great with the music and stunts, and all, but a tad bit slow between stunts.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I knew from the start, when Reeves was alone in the subway, that I was in trouble.  \\"Sweet god, they are going to let him act with himself!\\"  I think, were my exact words.      This movie is horrible.  The acting is enough to convince me that I should pack all my things and head to Hollywood straight away. No talent required apparently. It makes me scream for the days of excellent and bogus coming out of Reeves mouth.      Matrix 3 oozes cheese in a way that would make Ed Wood's Plan Nine seem like Citizen Kane by comparison.  Revolutions insults the viewers intelligence in ways that make the skin crawl.  For example,  how many times could it explain why they couldnt get the original actress whom played the oracle back? Changed cells?  I think I counted three at least.  I found myself screaming at the T.V.  \\"OKAY!!!!  I GET IT!!!!\\".     A prime example of a Movie turning into a product that takes itself way too seriously,  the third Matix film will forever in my mind be a horrible horrible thing.   Unless you are having some friends over and want something to rag on for a while, avoid avoid avoid.    On the bright side, you could turn off the volume watch.....it is very pretty to look at.
B000002N25|4.0|For reasons I could not possibly explain, I've put off reviewing this album and am going about it rather backwards from in front. Other reviewers have been over the top in their assertion that this is their favourite of Mark's solo works, and the standard for all the others to work off from. I do not agree. This is a great restart for him, and there are moments on this work that I would rate very highly, but overall I see it as an early effort; I don't know about anybody else, but I can see an obvious progression through time. My personal favourite is a few cds further on, but I am slavishly devoted to anything Mark Knopfler comes out with so I can only relegate myself to pointing out what really works for me and refrain from saying anything negative. High on my list here; \\"Imelda\\", a rockin little slam on the \\"Haves\\" (as opposed to the \\"Have Nots\\"); ditto for \\"No Can Do\\" (I worked in that factory too, Mark); \\"Vic and Ray\\", although I have no clear idea what it's about (and I'm not sure I want to know); I love \\"Cannibals\\" - even more do I love the story behind its creation. I recall putting this cd in the player for the first time (I even remember exactly where I was) and getting this huge smile as the sounds of The Chieftains filled the car, thinking, \\"Only on a Mark Knopfler album.\\" (Having purchased the other three previously, I had, of course, prior warning there would be really different stuff on the first disc.) I do not know a single other artist so diverse in his interests nor so willing to explore those interests, and praise be that he does. His folk interpretation is clear, evident and worthy in \\"A Night In Summer Long Ago\\" and \\"Done With Bonaparte\\" (which he thankfully still includes on setlists) and also on the title song \\"Golden Heart\\" and the interesting \\"Je Suis Desole\\". There are only a couple of songs on this cd that I routinely skip over; most of this, for all intents and purposes his inaugural work, is great, and shows the promise of an exemplary career that he has since fulfilled. Many many more, Mark - as long as you keep bringing them out, we'll keep taking them, and loving them.career that he has since fulfilled.

B000E97HIA|5.0|Every time I listen to new music from Prince, I feel he can't get any better because he is at the top in the business.  This new CD makes him unreachable.

B000AMJG4Y|2.0|For anyone who has played FF7 the game you will probably agree that is one of (if not the) best games you have every played.  You felt like it was real and you were part of a family.  I cried when Aires died. <br />The only good parts to this film are excellent CG, getting to see your old friends again, and in stunning detail. and the remakes of all the wonderful music from FF7.  It was great how they started the movie right where the game left off.  Other than that, this movie was practically a mockery of the epic game. <br />There was ZERO character development so if you haven't played the game I wouldn't even bother watching the movie.  My wife watched it with me and I spent countless times pausing the film and explaining what things were.  Even the new characters were difficult to figure for motives and things.  There was practically no plot and even when there was it wasn't explained well.  Most of the scenes had nothing to do with each other, they were just static displays of CG for no reason.  The fight scenes were impossibly stupid.  it was weird watching these characters that were so painstakingly created to be as human looking as possible climb on walls like a spider and launch 100s of feet in the air.  Picture real people acting out a Dragonball Z episode  (CORNEY!)  I could go on and on about how dumb these fight scenes were and they accounted for 1/2 the movie.  One other part about the fights that was so annoying was the way they sped up and slowed down the filming.  They sped it up when they made contact with each other so fast that you couldn't tell who hit who or what happened.  and then they slowed it down when nothing was happening so you get these long slowmo shots of them stareing at each other! <br />The end scene where they're all launching Cloud into the air was just the stupidest thing ever.  Might as well watch the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, that's more realistic! <br />They made very poor use of materia and magic.  There was only 1 scene where they showed someone \\"adding\\" materia and he doesn't even put it into a weapon or armor like the game, he shoves it into his arm (like into the skin)  It was so stupid. <br />DUMB DUMB DUMB STUPID and DISAPOINTING! <br />

B0009OAUIO|4.0|This is one of Bowie's lesser known albums.  Released in 1971, (before the Ziggy Stardust era), this collection of tunes displays the full range of his lyric and musical talent.  The songs range from tin pan ally like dittys \\"Fill Your Heart\\" to portraits of existential struggle (Quiksand) and alienation (Life on Mars).  As a whole, Hunky Dory runs the gammut between light and dark, between profound contemplation and lighthearted celebration of ordinary life, from bohemian recklessness to a kind of funky domesticity which typifies the heart of a thoughtful man in strange times. <br /> <br />Musically this album is a treat with the Guitar of Mick Ronson and piano of the young Rick Wakeman (of Yes fame).  These luminaries of the early 70s british progressive rock scene provide a glimpse of the more stripped down, barebones sound of the yet unborn pubrock and pre punk sounds.  The compositions are musically subtle yet more fun than much of the music of the time.   <br /> <br />The only weak point in this otherwise masterful work is the rather poor production value.  It is clear that not as much money and time was poured into Bowie's production as that of Yes or King Crimson.  Yet even this drawback sometimes works in the album's favor as it provides a kind of unpretentiousness that heralds the \\"back to basics\\" vibe of later greats like Nick Lowe, Graham Parker and Elvis Costello. <br /> <br />If you are just discovering David Bowie, this disc is a great way to get deeper into the heart and soul of this incredible artist.  If you are an old fan, perhaps you may have let this album stand in the shadow of Ziggy Stardust, Heros or any of Bowie's monumental works.  If this is the case, bring this disk into the light and hear the unglossed soul of Bowie. <br /> <br />Enjoy <br />Frank

0451526384|5.0|Jane Austen's *Persuasion* was her last book before she suddenly, unfairly died, and it is profoundly different than her earlier works.     In this book, Anne Elliot, the protagonist, is past the bloom of her youth, all of 27 years old. She gave up the love of her live, Captain Wentworth, when she was twenty because she was persuaded that he was not socially a proper match for her. Considering the vast importance of a proper match, or a good match, in Jane's earlier works (such as *Pride & Prejudice* in which Lizzy Bennet, who is essentially penniless and perhaps soon to lose her home, makes the ultimate \\"good match\\" in which she marries Pemberly, er, Mr. Darcy) it is interesting in this book how Jane examines the results of declining a socially and economically imprudent match. Anne Elliot's life is blighted when she gives up love merely because Wentworth is not enough for her. She becomes an old maid. This book is an admonition to the flighty young girls who sought \\"good matches\\" at the expense of love. It's a grown-up's book.     *Persuasion* also funny as all heck. That first sentence, \\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt,\\" is a damning statement about people who don't read good literature, but only read books of mere facts, like the Peerage. Anne's older sister is just as daft and great for an eye-rolling laugh.     TK Kenyon  Author of [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1601640226 Callous]]: A Novel

B00005O438|5.0|A dog could be so scary.  I love dogs and have never once met one I was scared of, but after seeing this film I have my reservations.  Taking a St. Bernard, a loyal and jovial dog and making it the prime baddy in this film was pure genius.  I feel that it was that fact that makes the film all the more terrifying.  If the dog had been a mere Pit Bull, something that many view as mean, it wouldn't have been so terrifying, but taking a dog that many view as a sweet and lovable animal made all the difference.  The film is about a dog that's biten by a rabid bat and goes pretty much insane.  I've never seen a rabid animal like this.  Most rabid animals are scared of humans and only attack after being provoked, wereas Cujo went out to stalk his prey.  A woman and her son are his latest targets and the center of this film revolves around these two stuck in their brokedown station wagon as Cujo tries to break in for a few days.  The acting is pretty good, and even though the boy was somewhat annoying, he was convincing in his terror.  The dog was the star though, I still have no clue how they got that dog to do all that crap.  Very smart dog.  Anyways, it's not the scariest thing you'll ever see but it will chill a few bones.

B000E33VWW|5.0|`Capote' chronicles the efforts of author Truman Capote as he researches for his last completed book.  That last book was the non-fiction novel `In Cold Blood' which delved into the murder of a Kansas family on November 14th 1959.  On that fateful day two men broke into the Clutter home and murdered everyone home.  This event rocked the country, but most of all it drove Truman Capote mad with obsession as he struggled to create the greatest piece of literature ever written.  Truman succeeded in a sense, for `In Cold Blood' made him one of, if not the most famous author in America, but it's not the book itself but the journey to completion that this film presents to us, and it does so masterfully. <br /> <br />What makes this film as effective as it is is its attention to detail.  First of all the entire film is shot in very subtle tones.  Everything is quite, from the voices to the eerie score by Mychael Danna; everything is almost in an undertone.  Nothing is overbearing but it all adds to the feel of growing obsession.  The opening scene, where a young girl finds the dead body of her best friend, is a perfect example of what I mean.  The scene is shot with such composure and lucidity that you're almost not sure what you've just seen.  Not many films with this dark a subject attack a project like this with such candor and grace, but director Bennett Miller shows so much caution and delicacy with each approach that you swear he's mastered his talent.  He approaches this film, not with the `in your face' antics that most if not all crime noirs use but he gives us a stripped down raw feel. <br /> <br />The score, that constant piano playing is light and background, never breaking the surface and steeling the spotlight but playing perfect companion to the lucid feeling of the film. <br /> <br />As Capote (Hoffman) hears first hears of the murders he's immediately intrigued.  He has been waiting for an inspiration, something to sink his creative teeth into and so he decides that an article for the New Yorker on the effect this crime has had on the small Kansas community may be the answer.  He travels along with fellow author and friend Nell Harper Lee (Keener) to Holcomb Kansas to interview the townsfolk, but what he finds is far more than he had anticipated.  Capote, upon meeting the accused, immediately forms a bond with one of the men, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and begins to interview him excessively, furthering his fascination, and, in a sick weird way, his love interest.  Capote goes as far as to get the two men a new lawyer, one that can properly defend them.  This gesture is portrayed to mean one of two things, and the film helps you lean towards one, yet never letting go of the other.  Either Truman wants them around to finish his book or he really has fallen for this killer.  As Truman says himself, it can't be both. <br /> <br />Truman's obsession with this case and the men involved starts to put a strain on his relationships, most of all with his boyfriend Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), but also with Nell as he becomes somewhat self-obsessed and or absorbed.   Truman is painted as a very self-centered man, and this is shown in a few different ways.  One is the fact that whenever other people are around Truman is always shown as the one doing the talking, almost as if he's entertained by the sound of his own voice.  In actuality, while Catherine Keener received a `Best Supporting Actress' nod for her performance (and it was astonishing) she really didn't do too much talking.  Capote completely controlled a conversation.  Another way his self-love is shown is in the way he pays others to compliment him, as if to boost his own self-confidence and make himself desirable to others.  And the final way, or at least the largest display, is the way he could turn any occasion into his occasion, as is seen when he visits the movie premier for Nell's `To Kill a Mockingbird' and he can't `pretend' to be having a good time, not even for her sake.  Her face, her eyes, her final words to him \\"what did you think of the movie\\" say everything. <br /> <br />The acting in this film, while yes it is what you may call impression acting, is superbly done, notably by Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who embodied the role of Truman Capote and delivered on every level.  His eyes do a lot of talking in this film, and to me, my favorite scene is another subtle yet powerful one, and one of the scenes I use to prove how powerful this film is in all its calm nature.  The scene where Truman visits the morgue to see the slain is especially prominent, for as he lifts the mothers coffin and looks at her body we can see his soul.  Hoffman, in this scene, with just his eyes portrays a level of understanding and mortification that far surpasses that of `over-acting' and `melodramatics' for if he had made any movements at all, made any sounds or started to cry he would have lost all affect in my opinion, but it was his blank stare and monotone stance that drove home every point we needed.    <br /> <br />As a whole, this film is exceptionally executed, brilliantly acted, directed and scripted and is, not just a great movie but also an exceptional work of art.  I'd highly recommend the viewing of this docudrama for it opens the eyes and the mind and helps us all see what one man worked so hard for us to understand.  The last few frames are crushing as we watch everything this man wish for come true in shocking realizations that made him make the very statement I chose for my title... \\"More tears are shed for answered prayers than unanswered ones\\" and that is such a true statement! <br />
0451197968|5.0|It's 2025. The world's poor live in abject poverty while the rich live in highrises ignoring the starving masses grovelling around them. Dissent is repressed by heavy handed police, and the ironically named Free Vee (the TV went out of style years ago) with its sadistic game shows. These macabre shows - with names like 'Fun Guns' and 'Dig Your Own Grave' - tempt desperate slum dwellers with quick cash but in order to obtain the prize money the contestants must put their body and pride on the line for the enjoyment of the millions of viewers across the world. One man, Ben Richards, driven by the inability to provide for his wife and influenza stricken daughter, decides to join the hundreds of impoverished who line up before the enourmous Games Building for a chance to win the elusive prizes. Richards however is different from the average drug addict or street bum who tries out for the games. He's fit and smart - exceptionally smart. So intelligent that he's picked for the most grueling show of all: 'The Running Man'. A game where the player must try to stay free as long as he can as he tries to hide from the rest of America and a group of elite special forces called the Hunters. If the contestant is caught before thirty days (an impossible goal) the game is over and the contestant killed. <br /> <br />I immiediatly began to enjoy the main character, Ben Richards from the very start. King creates a typical outcast of society, and rebel of authority but then adds a more sensitive side to the character. Balancing Richards' scathing wit with his powerful love for his family the author makes Richards both intensly charismatic and convincing. Defintely one of my favourite literary characters ever. However King doesn't stop there. The supporting characters are all really realistic as well especially people like Evan Mcone - the sinister leader of the Hunters - and Bradley - the streetwise visionary who is attempting to start a revolution. <br /> <br />King also adds a little bit of satire in his novel. In 'The Running Man' he brings to light how TV is a dangerous weapon which can be used against people. The Free Vee in his novel is a horrible object which pumps propaganda and manufactured happiness into the homes of millions across the nation. It easily suppresses the masses who would otherwise rise up in rebellion. With America today inudated with war propaganda and mindless reality TV shows it is not difficult to find the parallel between the story and reality. In times like these this novel gives an important warning that not everything you see on the boob tube is real. <br /> <br />The novel combines this satirical edge and realistic characters into an exciting storyline which will keep you 'running' through the book as fast as you can to reach the action packed conclusion. An excellent intelligent thriller every one should read.

B0001FR3IQ|4.0|'Gothica' succeeds in scaring the daylights out of the viewer, but in delivering a smart and plausible thriller it lacks a little.  'Gothica' remains dark and ominous throughout it's timeframe, delivering chills and jumps and skin crawling effects at a non-stop almost brutal pace, but when it all breaks down in the final frames I'm almost left a little bitter.  The film follows Miranda (Berry), a psychologist, as she's accused of murdering her husband and boss (Charles S. Dutton) and placed in the same asylum she works at.  Her workmate and friend (Downey Jr.) is trying to believe her story of ghosts and such but is finding that task very hard.  Why did she kill her husband and why is this bitter young girl, dead four years now, trying to hurt her?  The film, as I said, follows a breathtakingly brutal pace, giving you one spook after another, and even after all is revieled I was still, while slightly jaded, happy non-the-less in the fact that this film was actually scary, but the final frames, when Berry's charactor has to do the right thing and exact vengence it's just really lame.  Despite, up until the corny effects and lame ending it's still well worth the watch if not for the freak-factor that lines each frame like cobwebs line the frame of your house.  The acting is also a nice touch, especially since most horror films contain terrible actors, but the likes of Berry, Dutton, Downey Jr and Cruz are all top-notch, especially Cruz who embodies her role and really convinces you she's insane...or maybe not.  Oh yeah, and why the crap is Fred Durst siging the theme song to this movie?  That's a mood killer!

B00002MZ2T|3.0|I fell in love with Savage Garden's debut a long time back, and still have the c.d. to this day. I really enjoyed their sound and the beautiful songs they made including To The Moon and Back and Carry on Dancing.  <br />I heard a little while ago Crash and Burn and I Knew I Loved You off their sophmore album on the radio and always wanted to get around to buying it. I finally found it at a bargin store and decided it was none better time to finally get it. I bought the album just on the love I held for their debut album.  <br /> <br />Well the album is a bit of a disappointment. It does not hold the same power as their debut, nor as many memorable songs. The whole album Affirmation gives off a very \\"meh\\" kind of feeling for me. A lot of the songs sound nice to listen to, but there's not a lot there to really be exicted about. <br /> <br />The strongest songs on here are I Knew I Loved You, Crash and Burn, The Lover After Me, The Best Thing, and You can Still be Free (which is probably the most amazing song on here). Affirmation can get kind of annoying but it sounds all right. Those are the songs I usually turn to when I put this album in. A lot of the other songs on this album I do not play nearly as much- although I don't hate any of the songs. They just are sort of boring compared to the ones I mentioned.  <br /> <br />When I recommend Savage Garden to anyone though, I do recommend their debut instead.  <br /> <br />3.5/ 5

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is full of a type of magic that is hard to explain, and even more difficult to find on conventional TV these days. The show contains an amazing of realistic banter between its stars, yet has enough great moments to truly make a dent in your mind. It's a show that can be \\"enjoyed by all ages.\\" Yes, that statement is trite, but it's never been more true for a single show. The adults face real problems and don't always do the right thing. The teenagers on the show have their moments of grace, yet also fall from it as well. But in every episode, there is a the substance of a heart that carries the show to amazing heights.  <br />      It's bittersweet, pathetic, and frustrating that the WB cancelled it. If given proper attention, such as not having it endure a hiatus, promoting it properly, and not flipping its timeslot, it could have continued to bloom. The CW should have picked it up, but of course we need more of their \\"innovative\\" TV. I guarantee most, if not all of their new shows will be gone in a less that a year; Pepper Dennis anyone?  <br />       What's even sadder is the rest of the seasons won't be coming out until there is enough of a demand in terms of sales for them to warrant a release. So please support the show and try it. It's not just a bunch of kids watching it, I'm a grown man and doctor, so I'm not some burnt out kid who just watches lots of TV, I watch what really matters. I hear that many will be boycotting the new CW this fall, that's smart. I wish ABC Family would try to renew the series on their network this fall, since they're showing the reruns. It's a shame, shows like Seinfeld took time to catch on, and look at it now. Would Everwood have become Seinfeld? No. But it could have gained a more massive following with time, but I guess creative integrity can't stand up to the mighty Neilsons. The cast and show deserved better and still do, so please help support this show. Let's drive home the point that the WB/CW are ignorant of quality and peoples thoughts like a railroad spike.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|I thought this movie was kind of blah, the characters were not interesting, it kept reverting to previous scenes (in his mind), and nothing really happened. The overall plot and subplot was good, but it didn't make much use of it. The wife fell asleep right away in this one.
B00005R23S|3.0|This was a decent concert performance by Bruce, however most of the songs I'd not heard before, and it took Bruce about half the CD to get with the program. Suddenly it was like someone reminded him he was being recorded live, and he jumped to it-- getting crowd involvement, and motivating his band to do more than just go through the motions of yet another concert.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This was a good movie overall and I enjoyed it. However I can't give it 5 stars, almost gave it 3. It moves along very slowly and can be hard to follow. Some of the characters don't have any depth and you are only left to wonder about their motives. It's not something I would want to watch over and over again either. The battle scene is great though. People talk about the crusades as some foolish thing in the past, but try to imagine riding a horse and taking a ship over a huge distance like that to fight for something you believed in. We can only imagine.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|This movie is so disjointed, so convuluted as to be nothing about something. Think of a New Orleans Jazz band with each instrument playing a totally different song at the same time and you have this movie in a nutshell. Too many strings left untied, too many subplots within subplots. I saw this movie because I generally like George Clooney movies but this isn't near one of his best. To quote a character from \\"JFK', It's a riddle wrapped in an enigma. It's also not worth your time seeing it.
B000AWYOG4|2.0|Not much to say about this one except it just kind of droaned on and didn't offer much. It had a few scary spots but the scenes seemed repeated within the movie. It seems like many of Jennifer Connelly's movies show her as depressed and try to have us feel sorry for her. She's one of my favs but that does seem to be the case. I was just disappointed with this movie.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|One reviewer said 'The passion is gone. The pain is gone.' Well, when I first listened to Decemberunderground, I could not quite put my finger on what was missing. Finally, I realized what it was: the pain. This album sounds...well...happy! But still passionate! The passion is NOT gone - just redirected!<br /><br />I am not referring to lyrics, but to the overall tone and feel of the music and of Davey's voice. It has a similar texture and artsiness as Sing the Sorrow, but is way more upbeat.<br /><br />The exception is 'Endlessly...she said' which could easily have followed 'This Time Imperfect' on STS.<br /><br />Once I realized this, I quit looking for that elusive 'something' and was able to really enjoy the album.<br /><br />Hey, if Davey is happier now, and it reflects in his music, then that is awesome! He has touched our souls with his incredible voice; don't begrudge him a bit of joy in life!<br /><br />Actually, Davey's voice has evolved. I just saw them live for the 2nd time and I noticed how much stronger Davey's voice was than the last time I saw them. Mmmmm....yummy!<br /><br />Jade's guitar is superb. He does a lot of interesting, new things. So musically this album rocks!<br /><br />Adam is more pronounced on this album, too, especially on tracks 8 & 9. Awesome, percussive, textured. And I love Hunter's lead bass, as always.<br /><br />If you are into punk rock, start with the early albums and work your way up. However, if you are into any other style of music, start with either Decemberunderground or Sing the Sorrow and work you way back.<br /><br />I love the last 4 albums pretty much equally. All of them are masterpieces from this exquisite band!<br /><br />Buy it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This series is great! I'm only sorry the show has been cancelled. I'm looking forward to purchasing Seasons 2-4 and hope they are available soon!
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I have played final fantasy 7 for hundreds of hours, loved it and consider it one of the greatest story driven games ever. Final Fantasy 7 stands taller than any other turn-based RPG. So, I had high expectations for the movie. It was a huge letdown. The characters seem to have far less personality and dimension than the game's characters. The events seem to have no cohesiveness - even understanding who the characters were it wasn't clear what their motivation was. The CG was superb technically but it seemed like some of the environments were inspired by later Final Fantasy games (too heavily doused in Japanese pop culture). In the end it just seemed like the director tried to generate interest by blasting the screen with ridiculous fight scenes where no one cares of the outcome.
B00064MW6K|4.0|I had some doubts about this one and maybe that's why I liked it.  Another superhero movie remake and all that.  But it was surprisingly entertaining.  What struck me most, was that this was a lot like a female version of Spiderman although not as good.  There were even some CGI moments when it looked like Patience was a Spiderman.  Actually, I don't think cats can scale walls, so I'm not sure where that super power came from.  The ending was also reminiscent of Spiderman, except that it wasn't for the good of humanity, but for the good of those she knew.<br /><br />Halle Berry did a good job of portraying the artsy self-conscious Patience and the Catwoman character.  The movie was quite clean as well.  There was minimal swearing, the violence wasn't sick or gross, and no nudity though the Catwoman outfit was a bit revealing (and didn't look comfortable).  I also liked the link to history, and it made me wonder how much was real and how much was contrived about that.  As for that beauty product - no matter the side affects, I bet there are a few women who would want to use it anyway, fully knowing what it will do to you.<br /><br />There were a few cheesy moments such as obvious CGI and her stuntwoman not looking quite like her.  But this is that sort of movie genre, so some of that is to be expected.<br /><br />If there is such a thing as a moral in this story, it is not to be afraid to live your life whether it's your Patience side or your Catwoman side.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|Saying you hate this musical is like saying you eat babies for breakfast. But I saw it this weekend, and hated it, and so did 5 of my friends. Pass the babies.    Every song--EVERY song--sounds the freakin' same. The Wizard's number starts out as a softshoe, but then changes its mind and goes back to schmaltzy pop. Glinda's \\"Popular\\" also starts well, but then falls apart (and several published reviews will confirm this). The rest of the soundtrack is the same old jumble of cookie-cutter musical theatre that we all know so well, with little variation between styles. They had so much leeway here--they're not bound by any specific time period or theme--so why make everything come out sounding like a Jazzercise class?    Quite aside from the music, the lyrics often don't make sense. Several of the characters are radically different from the versions we are familiar with (the Tin Man is capable of hate? What?). The songs do absolutely nothing to advance the plot (which moves at a snail's pace), or to develop characters. They're just tedious time-outs on a very long yellow brick road, and will have you checking your program compulsively to see how much more of this you have to sit through.     If you thought Phantom was genius, well....this is the musical for you. But if you like genuine writing talent and creativity, look elsewhere.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|this timeless piece of rock history was first heard as an album when i was in high school in 1979. We played it to death but now almost 30 years later it still rocks. A perfect compliment to it would be 84.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I was trying to think of the best musical soundtrack I know of off the top of my head, and came up with this one. This episode contains songs that you can actually tell apart (a fatal flaw of many musicals), and each style of music is well-suited to the character(s) singing-- heavy metal, softshoe, classic 1940's comedic duet, love ballad, and great 1st act curtain showstopper. Best of all, they're short--a couple of minutes at most. Solos are interspersed with duets and all-cast tracks. Excellently done, both funny and serious by turns in a way that doesn't jerk you around.
B0002GTWQA|5.0|Conrad's novel, like many he wrote, was on one level a ripping yarn, and on another, an exploration of the inner man.  The psychological aspect to the story, written at the turn of the twentieth century, heralded a new style of fiction.  This adds to its interest, although the heavily descriptive prose is an acquired taste. <br /> <br />It is the journey of a troubled outcast, roaming the South Seas in a time gone by, taking us through adventure and ending in redemption.  It is both glorious romance and personal enlightenment.  The novel opens with a description of the character, a manly seaman, dogged and taciturn, yet susceptible to deeper agony.  This was the essence of the story: the soul in tempest. <br /> <br />The picture is a very competent adaptation of the book, well written and filmed on location with an excellent cast.  Peter O'Toole is a fine actor and at this time was at the height of his powers.  He is more suited to playing eccentrics and had already defined Lawrence of Arabia on screen.  He might have been less convincing as Jim, but his performance was solid and sufficiently enigmatic to carry the role.   <br /> <br />Like all good stories, it has a good ending.  While not a happy one, it is the most satisfying resolution of a tale you will ever get.  The written version is exquisite, and the film captures this beautifully.  You will never forget it. <br />
B00003CWN3|5.0|A warning first:  The NC-17 rating was justifiably earned due to the very graphic violence of the rape scene. This one is clearly not for the kiddies, and those who have been raped in the past should not watch this one alone as it is very realistic. <br /> <br />Having said this, I have three words: watch this movie. <br /> <br />Hillary Swank is brilliant in her portrayal of Brandon Teena, a female to male transgendered person who was raped and murdered in Nebraska in 1993.  In fact, her performance was so good that I thought a man protrayed Brandon Teena, or at least an actual female to male transsexual who was also a good actor.  Her performance is accurate and powerful, and clearly she had done some research into the role. <br /> <br />For those not familiar with the story, I can tell you it is fairly accurately portrayed in every detail.  Brandon Teena was born Teena Brandon.  In 1993, Brandon Teena was living in with Lana Tisdel, when he was exposed as having been born female by John Lotter and Marvin Nissen, who stripped him in front of Lana.  They then took Brandon Teena outside, drove for a distance, and repeatedly beat and raped him. <br /> <br />When Brandon Teena reported the rape to law enforcement, they were insulting and hostile.  Eventually, the arrested Lotter and Nissen, but they were quickly released despite the violent nature of their crimes.  The two then hunted Brandon Teena down and murdered him, as well as Lisa Lambert and Philip DeVine, a couple Brandon was staying with at the time.  Refusing to accept Brandon as anything but an \\"it,\\" law enforcement thought DeVine, a disabled black man, was the true target.  Both Nissen and Lotter are members of white supremicist groups. <br /> <br />The story is powerful and needs to be told, repeatedly, if this sort of bigotry is to be stopped.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Great CD. I love it.  Received it very quickly.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This has to be one of the best documentaries I've seen in years.  After having seen it, I have little doubt that the media will hate it, and that politicians from both parties in power will villify it. <br /> <br />The film starts off with questions surrounding the 2000 Presidential Election, particularly the media's refusal to question what had happened, and the refusal of Democrats in the Senate to even challenge the actions of the opposition, their own candidates, and the courts. <br /> <br />The screen then goes to black, and you hear the sounds of the attacks on the World Trade Center.  You'll know what is happening without pictures, trust me. <br /> <br />After that, Moore chronicals the events leading up to 9/11, the Administration's perceived lack of action and direction, and the events leading up to and including the war in Iraq.  Moore calls into question actions taken by the federal government to hinder investigations, help the bin Laden family, Saudi involvement in 9/11 and in the decision making processes of our own government, and so forth. <br /> <br />Moore goes on to point out what he sees as the hypocrisy of politicians and the media.  He shows the recruiting tactics of military recruiters who leave wealthy neighborhoods alone while actively targeting poor and minority groups.  He shows the absurdity of media attempts to perpetuate fears, particularly when it benifits the current political leadership. <br /> <br />Moore takes no prisoners, particularly amongst the media.  While many will interpret this film as \\"a liberal attack\\" on \\"conservative values,\\" the film really goes after the media as the main culprits behind what Moore sees as the failures of our current government and society. <br /> <br />Love him or hate him, Moore is brilliant.  Regardless of your politics, the film will leave you with more questions than answers.  If you truly value what this country represents, you will see this one.
0321127420|5.0|I loved this book!  It was exactly what I was looking for when I went searching for patterns that would help with a new business application.  It provides alternative solutions to the typical implementation problems associated with business systems, both from a design standpoint and from the perspective of the implementation.  The alternatives are compared and weighed in light of the execution environment and cost of implementation, with a comparison of advantages and disadvantages, along with Martin's recommendations.  I had the feeling that the comparisons and recommendations were made not based purely upon a theoretical optimum, but also based upon practical and real-world experience with these patterns.
0684135051|5.0|I have been knitting for over 40 years and I still managed to learn from this book.  It has gotten me excited about my knitting again.  Elizabeth Zimmernamm's book make interesting reading even without the great pattern ideas.  I would recommend this book for every knitter.
0201633612|5.0|This is my primary resource for reference purposes.  It's my first stop when I need a specific pattern.  I recommend the Head First book for learning; this book for the basic patterns; and Martin Fowler's Enterprise Application Architecture book if you are designing business applications.  Also, Partha Kuchana's Design Patterns in Java book is great if you are using Java.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I just couldn't sit there anymore....the movie was painfully boring, the storyline totally rediculous....the stuff they put in to shock us was amusing...and not in a good way. <br />This movie didn't need to be made.
B000BCE918|4.0|I was a Kid when I saw the first one and I loved it. The Day it came out on VHS mom bought it and I wore it out. The first one alone is worth the other two they don't add up to the first but they are still entertaining, and how can you beat the price.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|A great Album.  Listen to it often in the car. <br />The lyrics are about life.
0517053616|5.0|What can I say? Shakespeare is the man. For any of you who love shakespeare, or just need a good reference for class; this book is amazing... not only that but you will look really intelligent if you have a thick leather bound shakespeare book on your bookshelf haha
6305910340|5.0|Excellent movie, very clear digial reproduction, in widescreen format.  Acting performance was rated five stars.  Plot and story, five stars.  I especially liked the scene where the parents were fighting over allowing their son to continue in Chess competitions.  Excellent purchase.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A fairly correct interpretation of what would happen if the religious right gained the kind of control of the government that it wants to gain.  A wonderfully & subversively crafted film.  Great story construction.  Hugo Weaving is, as usual, Magnificent!!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Simply put this has to be the greatest cowboy movie ever made even if it was made for TV. I would even go so far to say it is one of the greatest movies ever made period.<br /><br />The casting and acting are perfect and it appears to be filmed on real locations instead of Hollywood back lots.<br /><br />I have about worn it out from endless viewings and as Tommy Lee Jones say, \\"By god I'm as 'merican as you.\\"

B000F7CMRM|1.0|Maybe I'm stupid, but I have no idea what this movie was about. Something to do with oil and coruption. But other than that, I couldn't really figure out who the characters were and what they were doing. The cast was WAY too big and the storylines kept jumping around so fast that by the time it got back around to what George Clooney was doing I had forgotten what he did in the scene prior to that. I was completely lost in this very confusing movie.

B0002W18MU|4.0|Almost three years after the death of The Man In Black, on the auspicious date of July 4, 2006, the fifth (actually sixth, if you include Unearthed) album in the justly acclaimed Johnny Cash American Recordings series was released (and it's apparently not the last one, either.)    It is certainly the mellowest of these records, with perhaps the least surprising track listing, and it boasts no \\"pop crossover\\" guest appearances. It also delivers a heavier dose of old time religion than the others did (except, of course, My Mother's Hymn Book in the Unearthed box set.)    But American V: A Hundred Highways is essential listening for all Johnny Cash fans, whatever you may have coming to you \\"when the man comes around.\\" And it's a very fine album, in its own understated, elegant, twilight way.    It's no secret that Rick Rubin's production on American V was completed years after Cash's vocals were recorded, but this is a seamless, natural mix with no traces of posthumous studio trickery. Mostly, there's a warm, genial, campfire glow to the proceedings, with predominantly unobtrusive acoustic instrumental backdrops behind the sometimes wavering but always awe-inspiring Voice of Cash.    The only touch of menace can be sensed on \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\\" which is the one time Rubin gets a little more adventurous with his production (to great effect, actually.) Otherwise there is a gentle, almost folky vibe throughout that perfectly complements these heartfelt songs.    Sometimes things even arguably get mushy to the point of squeamishness, as in Gordon Lightfoot's Muzak standard \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" and the awkward pop poetry of Rod McKuen's \\"Love's Been Good To Me\\" (which Sinatra couldn't sing convincingly, either.)    Overall, though, American V respectfully and lovingly completes and realizes the last artistic statement of a legend. Listening to this album, it's hard to believe that Johnny Cash isn't still among us, still singing, still recording. Thanks to Rick Rubin, in a way he still is.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I love the clip, clip of British acting and humor.  This trilogy is paced well, and extremely entertaining.  I'm glad I purchased it and know I will watch it over and over again.  I've watched it twice so far and can't believe the parts I missed the first time I watched because I was really absorbed in the plot.  I'm sure I'll pick up on other agenda/angles every time I watch it.
B00005221M|1.0|If you love this film. If you saw it in the theater and are longing to re-experience the thrill and romance. Forget it. Usually brilliant director Michael Mann has trashed the film with this director's cut. For example, Mann destroys the impact of Russell Means' final speech by adding a maudlin, politically correct diatribe in the final moments of this version. Buy the widescreen VHS of the original theatrical cut if you want the best version of Last of the Mohicans. The director should be ashamed to withhold the theatrical release from DVD. Don't waste your money on this DVD.
B00001OH1S|5.0|I could tell you that this soundtrack is the best collection of soft and smooth Jazz but too truly understand what I am talking about you shoud have a listen to the previews. I will say this, its not one of those cds that you buy and there is only one good song, the whole album is great,  <br />sheldon
B00003CX96|5.0|This is one I remember watching as a kid and never leaving the television untill it was over. A true classic.
B000ERU6QC|5.0|this album isn't any less masculine for all it's danceability. Great stuff and a must-see live.
B00005JLEX|3.0|The show was still finding itself in these early seasons, still hitting its stride, so the magic wasn't quite there yet.  Some of the changing characters - like Jerry's parents - and Kramer's personal (not hyper yet!) held it back.  But so what!  There were certainly a couple of gems and great things were to come!!
B000F48CD8|3.0|If you are a White Stripes fan, you really don't need to run out and buy this one. Like most \\"super-groups\\", the soul seems to get lost amongst the strong musicianship and this ends up sounding like a decent heavy pop record...not bad just not the meaty songs you get used to from the Stripes.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|There will never, NEVER, be another like a Sex and the City.  The show is just so fantastic, so real.  The insights into the four women's lives, as well as those of the minor characters, is penetrating and accurate.  I was never crazy about Samantha; I found her rather one-dimensional and much too focused on sex and only sex, sort of a one-note person.  But as the seasons progressed, particularly the final season, she became much more real; the cancer problem turned her into a real person.  And Smith Jarred!  What a hunk!   <br /> <br />It was never realistic that Carrie went to France with the Russian but I guess they wanted to create some drama for the inevitable Big showdown.  Whatever, it was a small point and I loved it!  What a show!  Recommended for everyone!  Guys and girls alike!!
1594200823|5.0|I just finished this book and it is one of the best I've read in a long time.  The writing is superb, the research excellent, his scope inclusive.  Highly recommended.  I am buying several additional copies as gifts.<br /><br />This book will change what you think about food and maybe even change you.  It has motivated me to eat differently.  I remain an avid omnivore; but I will be attending to the sources of my food much more carefully.  I will be attempting to meet the Joel Salatins (Polyface farm, grass-based) of my local world and buy from them.  I want my dollars to support them not Cargill and ADM.<br /><br />You might think this book would be preachy, overly-technical, too-detailed (there are many possible pitfalls here) but it is just a wonderful read, in addition to everything else it is.  It is excellent history.  It is memoir.  It is travel.  It is cuisine.  It is anthropology, botany, zoology, engineering.  Mr. Pollan pulls it all together in one very enjoyable whole.  Excellent work.<br /><br />(I would not be put off by the criticism of \\"too much about corn.\\"  That's the point there:  it is all-pervasive.  You must either show that or it's an empty statement.  If you are a fervent animal rights person, you won't be satisfied either -- please note the book's title.)
B000AYEIZY|5.0|So many of the great groups of the sixties, the Golden Age of Rock, if they return, come back as pale shadows of their former selves, either copying themselves note for note, or with new material that fails to live up to their past glories.<br /><br />Well this is NOT one of those. Cream is perhaps more on top of their game then ever before. As is said other places, there are more listening to each other and playing together and less virtuoso shoot-outs, less ego trips than at some moments the sixties.<br /><br />Tempos are a tad slower and less energetic than before, that helps coherent play. Others may disagree.<br /><br />There are some Blues listeners that feel Eric Clapton's best album was not with Cream at all but actually with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers in the \\"Clapton is God\\" era. Well they should listen to this. The broad, three-dimensional, muscular lines he played on that album fly across the soundstage here. Overwhelming. Deep, wide, high. When I first heard Cream, a long time ago, I was astounded that three people could produce musical sound of such depth and complexity. The amazing revelation of this CD set, the improvization, is that it is even more dense and complex than Cream of the past (or the recording quality is better so you can hear more detail!).<br /><br />Listen on a good stereo and listen up loud to appreciate!
015603008X|5.0|This book was one of the most addicting page-turners I have yet to pick up. It's lesson on life is adamant throughout the book, and seems to be an urgent message from the author. Wonderful story...a must read...
0451199871|5.0|This book had so many red herrings, I couldn't believe it. Agatha Christie proves once again why she's the Queen of Mystery. This one kept me gussing right up until the end. Clever, well-written mystery, multiple suspects, multiple motives...what more can you ask for?
B000E1NWJQ|5.0|The SACD reissues of RCA recordings from their wonderful 'Living Stereo' days is reaching full spate. The Reiner/ChicagoSO Respighi, rapturously acclaimed when it first came out, is heard here in even more glorious sound with the addition of SACD multichannel reproduction. The performance itself, along with the older and now sonically hors de combat Toscanini/NBC SO recording, are possibly the most exciting, the most 'right' I've ever heard. The Chicago was in marvelous condition in those days and the brass are especially glorious in the Pines of the Appian Way section. But lest we slight the winds and strings, they have their day, too, the latter especially deep and satiny in Pines of the Janiculum. Of more recent recordings of 'Pines' I have raved about a 2000 Cincinnati SO recording but this one, frankly, puts it in the shade both sonically and musically. This is a must-have for those who have the appropriate equipment to hear it in SACD.<br /><br />As for 'La Mer' it too is given a good performance but it is not going to be anyone's primary reason for acquiring this disc. There are too many other La Mer recordings that are its equal or better.<br /><br />As of the date of this review there are no sound clips for the prospective buyer to hear, but eventually, I assume, Amazon will put up sound clips from this disc and if they have by the time you're reading this I'd urge you to listen just to the first few seconds of the opening of 'Pines.' That high frequency orchestration, so exciting in live performance and so easily compressed and messed up by sound engineers on recordings, is absolutely clear and thrilling.<br /><br />This is a must-have. It's that simple.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is an assembly of musicians with at least one common goal: to produce great, thought-provoking music... by no one's standard but their own.  That is more than one can say about most musicians and even artists in general.  They deserve a lot of respect.   <br />10,000 days is the next step in the evolution of a band.  It is not better or worse, just different.  There are changes on all facets of the music.  Adam (guitar) and Justin (bass) are visionaries of music, and the base of the pyramid.  Maynard sings with such emotion and technique it blows me away.  Danny's drumming is integrated in the fabric of the music unlike any durmmer I have heard.  He is the easily the best drummer of all time.  Tool does take patience and time to appreciate.  But then again so does all great art. <br /> <br />Above all, it changes my idea of what music is.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 was much better than the 1st X-Men, not that it was a bad movie in any way... just more mutants & more action & a bigger plotline. Plus, it sets up the way for X3: The Last Stand, which I saw in theaters & it was also good, but this is the best one of the trilogy.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|It took me more than one hour to realize what this movie was about. I tried, with no success, to understand where the hell the story was going. Several times i asked to my girlfriend: why that people was doing that or why they said this or another. Oh my god. I got sick at the end of the movie but very happy because the director of the movie made me feel the \\"safe and comfort\\" with the accuracy of the missiles we throw since the Persian gulf. Don't waste your money in this movie unless you hate the mid-east world as much.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finally, another Batman movie that DOESN'T suck! The last good one was \\"Batman Returns\\"... \\"Batman Forever\\" had its moments, but thats where it went downhill, & the lame & totally stupida$$ \\"Batman & Robin\\" was both a waste of time & money. I remember watching THAT one, & almost halfway through, I was like \\"what a peice of s#it retarted f@#king movie!\\" But this one is very good. I've heard there is a sequel to this one curently in the works with CHristian Bale as Batman again... hopefully it'll be another good one & not something lame. But only time will tell I guess...

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine lent me this series before I purchased it.  I had never watched Firefly when it was on TV - didn't even know it existed.  Anyway, I watched the episodes back to back over the course of a couple of weeks, and discovered this is one of the best television series ever made.  Sadly, it was cancelled after just one season; what a crime! <br /> <br />The series is part sci-fi, part western - which sounds strange.  But, this unusual setting works!  The storylines are rich.  The characters are complicated - making them very real.  The acting is supherb.  No buyers remorse here; I highly recommend!
B000BISBDY|5.0|As a relative newcomer to the music of Mr. Cash, this album was recommended to me.  It includes great examples from his entire career.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I'll lay it out for you.  Pearl Jam will never make another \\"Ten\\", \\"Vs.\\" or \\"Vitalogy\\".  The days of PJ making music that EVERYONE will love are over.  However, the days of Pearl Jam making music that their fans will love are far from dead.  While I dug \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\", I never lied to myself.  There were great songs (Light Years and Love Boat Captain to name a couple), but the albums as a whole weren't up to PJ standards, especially following No Code and Yield.  Enter \\"Pearl Jam\\", the self-titled 2006 release.  The much hyped \\"come back\\" (PJ fans know they never went anywhere) has brought Pearl Jam back into the public eye.  It's no surprise to me, this is one fantastic album with something for everyone.  You've got some fast punk rock-esque songs (Big Wave, Life Wasted) and you've got some of the most wonderfully written songs of all time like \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job\\", the latter of which may very well be the best Pearl Jam song ever recorded.  While I don't think this is a 5 star album (cough* Yeild *cough), it's pretty damn close.  Thanks for another classic guys.
B000000OF6|5.0|I got this for my husband's birthday and we have been listening to it for the last month!  I am glad I read the reviews and bought the 2 disk Best Of Queen and not the 3 disk version since many people thought the 3rd disk was not good.  Since I bought the 2 disk one we are not dissapointed with any of our purchase.
1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink has written a breezy yet substantiated prediction of what will be valued in our world in the coming years.  While it is more far reaching than leadership, his vision of the future can relate to businesses, careers, and a shift in our culture generally, preparing the reader for the new era.  Overall it is a hopeful prediction.   <br /> <br />In addition to his conclusions and predictions, he has a succinct presentation in each of six chapters about the \\"Senses\\" or competencies that will be needed, and these are refreshingly creative:  design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning.  In addition to describing them and indicating the treasure-within for each of these, he ends the chapters with tips on developing ones' ability in each area, and resources for further study.  He intersperses hard facts (e.g. half of all Americans over age six play computer and video games) with implications.  He quotes prominent thinkers (e.g. Nobel economist Fogel:  \\"Spiritual inequity is now as a great a problem as material inequity, perhaps even greater.\\")  And suggests how that may change business.  Part of the charm of the book is his self-disclosure, combined with the gift for synthesizing seemingly unrelated references into something succinct and entertaining.    So it is not surprising that \\"Play\\" is one of his right brain high-concept senses for the new era.  This book combines thoughtful research and assessment of big ideas, with great writing and practical tips.  Highly recommended.  He is also an entertaining speaker. <br />

0395645662|5.0|A true classic.   Reviews indicate that The Giver is for ages 12 to 14, or young adult.   My 12 year old grandson told me it was his favorite book, so when I saw it at a yardsale, I bought it.   I'm 71, have lots of favorite books, but this is now added to my list.   Truly ageless!
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|First, I'd like to say this is a great album and a must listen for anyone that likes rock, punk or alternative music as the album offers something for everyone. <br />Second, I have to vent over some of these reviews. Firstly GN it's \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" not \\"Prayer and the Refugee\\" Also, to say harmony is missing in the song is laughable. The ending of the song as harmony in the guitar parts and in the vocals. The backup vocals in the song are excellent but are subtle and require you to listen to the song.  <br />On the whole, the album features excellent writing in the thoughtful lyrics that actually say something important, and the music which provides tempo changes, and great contrast between the versus, choruses, and the bridges and help capture the attention of the listener. At times the lyrics can become difficult to understand but it's nothing new from Rise Against. \\"Roadside\\" is perphaps the most interesting song on the album and features female vocals which work well with the music and the message of the song.  <br />Taken as a whole the album is another great release and can be enjoyed by a diverse group of listeners and is an excellent purchase. Enjoy.
0679405429|5.0|I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.<br /><br />One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.<br /><br />In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!

B00004RYU5|4.0|Blade Runner is a glimpse of the future; a future where Replicants (genetically created life forms) are outlawed and banned. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner (a cop who hunts Replicants) who, while hunting 4 violents Replicants, falls in love with a new model Replicant played by Sean Young.<br /><br />Director Ridlet Scott does a wonderful job of delivering to viewers a new and fantastic future. Twenty years later, Blade Runner still shines and looks fresh.<br /><br />The acting is Blade Runner was wonderful, as could be expected. Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson all put in brilliant performances, with the rest fo the cast putting in workman efforts as well.<br /><br />Possible spoiler below...<br /><br />Some may not like Blade Runner because of an ambiguous ending; an ending that leaves us wondering about a unicorn, and if it was a false memory. My main frustration with the ending is that I wanted the story to continue.<br /><br />Another frustration I had with the film was the end of the fight sequence between Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford. The reasons for Rutger not killing Ford were not fleshed out enough for my taste. If Ford was a Replicant, and I haven't read the book, it might have make some sense that Hauer spared Ford's life. Still, Ford killed many replicants, and it wasn't very believable that Hauer didn't kill him. The movie fails the viewer in this sense.<br /><br />Despite the flaws I loved Blade Runner, and will most likely purchase it on DVD and watch it again and again. It has too much good going for it to be called anything less than a great film.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 4 stars, and not 5, is because of the endless product placement scenes which begin to distract from the movie. We are flashed billboards and signs for Coca Cola, Atari, Budweiser, RCA, TDK, Bulova, and more. After the first scene with an advertisement, they get old and distracting fast. A movie of this caliber is weakened by product placement. I was constantly being pulled from my immersion in the movie back into reality, and that is a serious flaw.<br /><br />Despite this, please see Blade Runner.

038533558X|3.0|This was my second Coben book('No Second Chance'was my first). <br />I was aware of some plot similarities between this one and 'Tell No One'(just substitute 'dead girlfriend' for 'dead wife', and you've got the gist.)  <br />Coben does a nice job of characterization with the Klein family, although some of the supporting characters aren't as well-developed. 'Squares' was a bit too far-out; at times the scenes with him and Will read like they were re-writes of Dean Koontz's 'Moonlight Bay' series, only without the science-fiction elements. <br />The plot was okay, although it relies a bit too much on 'switched identities' and plot twists. The name of the villain, 'The Ghost', is just too laughable for a story like this. Little touches like this are better off in a Mary Higgins Clark book.  And the 'Every title has three words' bit gets old after a while, too). <br />If Coben relies too much on these gimmicks, his work is in danger of becoming formulaic. I'll have to keep an eye out for these touches in future books. I have 'Tell No One' to read sooner or later, but perhaps it'll be a good idea to read a few books before that one.
6304698798|5.0|Having been born the same year as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I was unfamiliar with the movie until this year. While reading commentary by Stephen King regarding the influences of his Dark Tower series, I noticed that the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had an huge impact on his desire to create the series. So, loving the Dark Tower books, I decided to view this classic Western, not knowing what to expect.<br /><br />Let me state that outside of Firefly, I know little about westerns and the genre. I was neither hot nor cold before watching this film. I was prepared to watch a good movie, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic movie with a expansive, almost endless feel. The scenery in the movie left me feeling that the Western land in the film went on forever.<br /><br />The story follows 3 men, Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, as they search for $200,000 in coins. Eastwood does an amazing job as Blondie.<br /><br />Eastwood defines the hard-nosed, cowboy hero/anti-hero role with this performance.  And Eli Wallach plays Tuco perfectly. You sometimes love Tuco, and sometimes hate him. At the end of the movie, half of you wants him dead and the other half wants him to live. Cudos to Eli Wallach. Lee Van Cleef puts in a wonderful performance as well. The opening scene in which he stands in the doorway, and interacts with a remote family is brilliant.<br /><br />For a long movie, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly does not drag. I fell in love with westerns as a result of seeing this movie (and Firefly), and am now planning on adding a few more older westerns to my \\"must see\\" list.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is a classic, with great acting, an awesome feel, a great story, and wonderful cinematics.

0312995423|1.0|The NSA is decrypting e-mail messages via the TRANSLTR, a supercomputer. An ex-employee develops a non decryptable  encrypting program and puts it out on the web. The key is to be auctioned.  <br />High-ranking members of the NSA try to decrypt the program and get themselves in a lot of trouble doing so. There is also the inevitable professor who gets almost framed by The BAD GUY..  <br />Unfortunately, there rests one question unanswered: if everybody already has got the program and is just waiting for the key, then what good is the planned action of the NSA? It won't help any. <br />Therefore, this is logically an impossible plot. The characters are equally impossible, motivated by cardboard emotions and lacking intelligence. The moral question involved in uncontrolled mass-decryption rests not only unanswered but is never asked (would you be happy to have your correspondence checked by a bunch of kindergarten cops?) <br />I was waiting for the real plot till the last page and was utterly disappointed.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Accomplished director Sidney Lumet directs a insightful and prophetic satire from the expansive mind of Paddy Chayefsky critiquing the business of network television production.<br /><br />CCA corporation frontman Frank Hackett played by Robert Duvall has taken over UBS network with the idea of finally turning it +<br /><br />into a profitable situation.  Lagging in ratings behind the big three, Duvall focuses on the news division headed by Max Schumacher played by the aged but excellent William Holden.  Duvall's plan calls for the firing of long time news anchor Howard Beale played superbly in Oscar winning fashion by Peter Finch.<br /><br />A disconsolate Finch announces on air that in one weeks time, he will blow his head off during his newscast.  His ratings take an immediate bump which comes to the attention of intensely obsessed TV generation programing vice president Diana Christiansen played by Faye Dunaway.  Dunaway encourages Holden to keep Finch on the air, against his better judgement but the ratings hike eventually flattens out.<br /><br />As Finch's time in gradually coming to an end, he has a bedroom epiphany which inspires him to come on the air after walking the rainy streets in his pajamas.  In a heartfelt spew with wild gesticulations he calls for those watching who are frustrated with their existence, to open their windows and yell that they 're mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore.  His rant strikes home and before long he is a media darling with the number one rated show.  This opens the door for Dunaway to fill her programing schedule with wild and revolutionary shows which threaten to drive UBS to the top of the network heap.<br /><br />As profits soar, corporate head Arthur Jensen played by supremely talented Ned Beatty is pleased.  However Finch goes too far with his angry prophet routine speaking out against corporate business practices.  He receives an angry rebuke in a brilliant soliloquy by Beatty, who decides that due to a ratings drop that Finch must be silenced.<br /><br />A combination of Lumet's top notch direction, a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make \\"Network\\" an all time cinematic classic.ngs drop that Finch must be silenced. <br /> <br />A combination of Lumet's top notch direction, a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make \\"Network\\" an all time cinematic classic.
B00000J7SS|3.0|More revolutionary than evolutionary, Bitches Brew in 1969 and even till now (according to a reviewer just before me) is a rather 'difficult' album but whose genius still is a hard act both to understand and follow. It is essentially Miles (MD) doing two things;<br /><br />(1) Slicing the hitherto existing Jazz music barriers by exploring new grounds with the inclusion and more extensive use of electric instruments. Hence he unknowingly goes on to introduce the Jazz genre known as 'Fusion' with (both his previous &) this album and this new Jazz form gains massive worldwide acclaim and recognition, shifting equally massive record sales at the same time.<br />(2) At the same time he silences both his critics and (as they're fondly termed) the Jazz purists with his defiant insistence and eventual success of his now electric-based band contrary to what the die hard purists had so lovingly clamoured and held on to i.e. the acoustic and 'natural form' instruments.<br /><br />The musical times and landscape as ever, was fast changing with truckloads of experimentation and improvisations going on across all genres and so was the seemingly resolved Miles and the Bitches Brew cast or crew (let's term them the BBC for now), they were indeed dynamic under MD & (yes, if you can feel it) JZ's leadership, the entire group became just as charged as their electric tools. One thing I found engaging was Miles' determination to succeed in & with the Electric music genre by having a full(er) band with whole rhythmic sections and not just have an instrument played by just only one individual, the band included (The brill brit) John McLaughlin, Wayne Shorter (whom I simply adore on the soprano), Bennie Maupin (Head-hunter no.2 and later no.1), Three other superstars all on the electric piano, Chick Corea, Larry Young and of course Miles' most trusted confidant in the guise of Joe (The Bad Weather man) Zawinul, also the 2 great bass wiremen-- Harvey Brooks & Dave Holland (though one's running on the electric) and finally, the tested & proven Lenny White and Jack DeJohnette on drums.<br /><br />Credit given where due but for me, even despite being a Jazz-head (just as I'd earlier used the word 'difficult') it was truly difficult to grasp the album's musical (& rather still experimental) concepts at first and even for a long time afterwards as I'd heard and purchased the album released just before Bitches Brew i.e. \\"In a silent way\\" (which is still very much on my 'heavy rotation' list) also made in the same year '69 and thought that one was exceptional & brilliant though somewhat ambient, I perhaps should have written a review about that one instead, IASW was the first album on which MD had actually introduced electrics, the album (on most versions and releases) has just only 2 tracks but believe me, 2 brilliant ones at that, it's best to advise people to test drive that one first and then this one and decide for themselves, personally, I'd rate it over BB but... that's only just my own opinion.<br /><br />Trivia... This album (on the tail of \\"In a silent way\\") also launches and propels the individual jazz superstar careers of pretty much all the IASW and BB band members, most notably Herbie Hancock & Bennie Maupin (both of the 1st Jazz platinum album group, The Head hunters), Joe Zawinul & Wayne Shorter (of the all star cult status Fusion jazz band, Weather Report). Amongst the other `BBC' members Dave Holland & John McLaughlin (Later of the Mahavishnu) deserve to be given a bit more credit as both performed exceptionally well on both MD albums mentioned above, and apart from both being British, they both have something else in common, that they were co-incidentally heard playing live by Miles at different gigs and a few days perhaps weeks later they became permanent fixtures in his ensemble, with Holland transitioning hard & fast from acoustic to the electric bass straight up and also John McLaughlin being honoured by Miles on the Bitches Brew albumwith a song surprisingly named after him.<br /><br />Last words/ Summary: A classic trend setting album which might be considered a bit too experimental (by some ears) but i suppose someone had to step up to the plate and 'do it' (Let's face it, Miles, like other GENIUSES got away with just about everything), as said above, the album has a very noticeable back up playing cast though i strongly believe they collectively could have created something much more of the calibre of MD's earlier releases (Yes, we're ALL still spellbound by 1959's \\"Kind of Blue\\" which anyone/ everyone that 'listens' to music SHOULD TRY, BUY & KEEP) and also for those who like a bit of visuals with their audio, check out B Brew's hugely amusing afrocentric style cover artwork...

B000EDWKXI|5.0|Some viewers may not rate Casanova as highly as Lasse Hallstrom's 1987 masterpiece, My Life as a Dog, or his 2002 rendition of Annie Proulx' novel, The Shipping News. But I thoroughly enjoyed this comic adventure, set in 18th century Venice, and scored almost completely with period works by composers Antonio Vivaldi, Roman, Tomaso Albinoni, and Jean-Philippe Rameau.<br /><br />The story is a fast-paced adventure of mistaken identities, and quickly engrosses the viewer. The story begins as the aged Casanova breaks off writing his memoirs to tell the story of one Francesca, a story, he says, that is not really his own. Then we are transported back to Casanova's childhood, as his mother sends him to live with his grandmother in Venice, promising to come back for him someday. We next find Giacamo Casanova (Heath Ledger) making love to a novice at a Venice convent, when a fellow nun knocks loudly at the door to warn him that the Inquisition officers are searching the convent for him.<br /><br />After a chase over tiled Venetian rooftops and jumping over canals, Casanova is taken into custody, where the Doge (Tim McInnerny) warns him that unless he marries an upstanding woman by Carnival, within three days, he will be exiled from his beloved Venice, or worse. Thus Casanova, aided by his loyal page Lupo (Omid Djalili), begins his hurried courtship of the virginal beauty Victoria ( Natalie Dormer), who unbeknownst to her, has been secretly beloved for years by Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox), who has been admiring her through his window across the canal from her father's pillazo.<br /><br />Challenged to a duel by the overeager young Bruni, Casanova finds himself the next morning facing an adept masked swordsman whom he shortly discovers to be Giovanni's sister Francesca (Sienna Miller). Casanova soon realizes he has made a terrible mistake; in fact he loves Francesca, whom he had seen earlier, while fleeing the Inquisition. He now begins to woo Francesca, first disguised as a wealthy gentleman merchant, Senior Salvatore and later, by assuming the identity of her promised husband, the wealthy Genoan lard merchant, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt), whom she has never seen.<br /><br />Francesca and her mother Andrea (Lena Olin) accept Casanova's faked second identity until Inquisitor Pucci (Jeremy Irons) arrives on the scene and concludes that all is not as it seems. Francesca even seems to be falling in love with him.<br /><br />The confusion that then ensues is sheer delight.<br /><br />As a fictional film, a romantic comedy, this film succeeds beautifully. If you like period films, and enjoy romantic comedy, this film is a great piece of entertainment.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

B000F0UUIM|5.0|Well, I never thought I'd put those four words together as a thought. <br /> <br />The Searchers is truly a fabulous movie.  <br /> <br />John Wayne's character, Ethan, is a man possessed of great intellegence and a damaged psyche, a sociopath with a sense of justice. His dominance over every character in the film makes him sensually interesting. He is only marginally redeemed at the end of the film. <br /> <br />All of the characters in the movie are well-drawn-out, none of them stereotypes (even, weirdly, the Indians) or ridiculous in any way. The crazy (retarded?) bald man (Moses) is the best example of that. He could easily have been a figure of fun, but he is treated with respect and patience by others. <br /> <br />Well, I could go on and on. This would be a great movie for John Wayne's performance alone, but I recommend it heartily for so many other reasons. The things that are only hinted at in this movie make it so intriguing -- Ethan's \\"lost\\" 3 years, his relationship with his sister-in-law, etc. This movie will stay with me for a long time.

I must say, that although it started out slow for me, I was facinated by the character builds and dialog set in this book.  I felt as though at somepoint in my reading I was drawn into the story and could see it all unraveling before me. Almost as if I lived in a time where and when this would have taken place.  I was impressed, to say the least, and I have gone on to read other titles as well.  I am now truly a fan of that extremely talented man, P.G. Wodehouse.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|Rise Against-The Sufferer And The Witness ****<br /><br />While not as good as its predecessor, Siren Song Of The Counter Culture or the bands debut album, The Sufferer And The Witness is still a great album so listen to. For the casual rock fan it offers everything, for the hardcore Rise Against fans it does the same. Tim's angst filled vocals and heartfelt lyrics seem to have stood still since the last record not gaining or losing anything. Joe's bass lines are more of a focus on this album and have grew greatly in quality. Chris' guitar playing is really the biggest improvement here. Killer guitar riffs and great leads have really proven him a great lead guitarist in this genre. Brandon's drumming is just as sound as it ever was, which is great because he is a great drummer. While not really trying much of anything new the band stuck with the formula of song writing and music that has worked for them in the past and the end result is a great album.<br /><br />The albums starts with `Chamber The Cartridge' and `Injection' which are the perfect songs to open the album. Blasting guitars, drums, and angry vocals set this album off right. `Ready To Fall' the lead single from the album is really the only song I can hear being played on the radio because the rest of the album just doesn't seem clear-chanal friendly, which if you ask me is a good thing. The song `Ready To Fall' one of the bands best songs to date, its truly a great song. `Bricks' while being only about a minute and thirty seconds long, in true punk fashion of course it's an awesome song, one of my personal favorites on the record. `Under The Knife' and `Prayer Of The Refugee' are both similar songs that I really couldn't see hearing with out the two being back to back, they are sort of like a tag-team that depend on each other, but when placed together are unstoppable. `Drones' is a personal favorite of mine, the best song on the album if you ask me. It contains killer guitar and dominant vocals as well as fantastic lyrics. Defiantly a hard act to follow. `The Approaching Curve' is half spoken word half rocker. I know, \\"what?\\" right. Well it actually works and it works well. `Worth Dying For' is a great song but it isn't a stand out track in anyway, and for that there really isn't much to say about it. One of the better songs on the album is `Behind Closed Doors' which is really the only other song on the album besides `Ready To Fall' that I think will be played on the radio. It's a fantastic song with a even better melody. `Roadside' is a slower song with very powerful lyrics some of the best Tim has ever written. `The Good Left Undone' is back to rocking. One hell of a song, its fast and loud. `Survive' ends the album better then any other song could, its fantastic. Everything comes together for this song. The chainsaw guitars and the fast vocals delivery with the thudding drums and rumbling bass make this the perfect song to close the album and leave you wanting more.<br /><br />One of the best things about this album is that it doesn't contain another `Swing Life Away' and don't get me wrong, that was a great song, no doubt one of the bands better songs, its just it was out of place on the last album and would have no doubt been out of place here. This is an excellent album and if you ask me it is one of the best albums of the year!ell as fantastic lyrics. Defiantly a hard act to follow. `The Approaching Curve' is half spoken word half rocker.

B000E8NRR6|5.0|One of the many intriguing things about Morph The Cat is that Fagen has revealed it to be the third and final installment of a trilogy. I've rediscovered \\"The Nightfly\\" and \\"Kamakiriad\\" with fresh ears all over again because of that, and all three albums fit together as neatly and seamlessly as any of his arrangements. <br /> <br />I could write volumes about this music, but as a musician who has studied (more like scrutinized to the point of damn near climbing down into the vinyl grooves and into this guy's head and LIVED in) this music for the past 30 years I believe that Donald Fagen is maturing like a fine wine. Interviews surrounding the release of this album reveal that he's more comfortable with himself as an artist than he's ever been in his career. It shows. In his performing, singing, storytelling, arranging - in every aspect of his art, his confidence and ease with himself shines brilliantly. Not to disparage his earlier work in any way, but I'm glad to see him continuing to evolve. Is this another Aja? Certainly not. There will never be another Aja. But do we need another Aja? No; we've already got one. And what an eargasm it is. And now we've got Morph The Cat. And what a damn cool cat HE is! Every time I listen to it I find something new. It's like examining a diamond and marveling at the unique views offered by each facet. <br /> <br />Donald Fagen/Steely Dan makes me strive to play better and I'm thrilled to have another album from this very interesting \\"Rabelaisian\\" mind to study, dissect, analyze, scrutinize, and get all groovy with. Whatever will he/they think of next? Maybe a full-blown Rhodes solo on the next one? It's been a long time since they threw us one of those. All watch the skies...
B00005JOSS|4.0|Director Alejandro Agresti chose a strange time to release The Lake House, in the middle of summer blockbusters, but it did reach an audience, and it did crack the top five at least once.  This film is not genuine Oscar considerable material, but it is a film that is constantly entertaining from beginning to end.  Before I get to the actual review, I want to step back and address the issue of the sort of \\"time travel\\" aspects of the film.  In a film where time travel is the main plot, such as Timecop and The Terminator, it is hard to look at the film without noticing flaws in time travel theories.  However, I ask you, the viewer, to see only time travel as a key to the strong and solid relationship between the characters in this film.  Do not get caught up in looking at the flaws dealing with the two different years, or how they have the same dog, or how any of this works.  Mainly look at how the relationship develops between Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) and Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br />That being said, here is the review.  Architect Alex Wyler and doctor Kate Forster live in the same lake house, only Alex occupies the house in 2004, and Kate in 2006.  Alex discovers a letter left by Kate in the mailbox claiming that she is the previous owner of the house.  The only problem is that the dates don't match up on their letters.  It doesn't take them long to discover that they are living in two seperate times, and neither of them seem to really be phased by this idea.  Alex is a bachelor who does not seem to mind, and Kate is single, with an on-and-off relationship.  The two begin writing back and forth, and Kate is able to predict the weather for Alex.  It is difficult to review this film, because every thing that I say puts another piece of the puzzle into perspective, and I would rather have you have the fun of putting it together yourself.  All I have to say about this film is that it is definitely one of my favorite films so far this year, although its not one of the best films of the year.  The performances are spectacular, both Reeves and Bullock, but the best performance comes from the always superb Christopher Plummer as Alex's stubborn architect father.  Plummer, like actors such as Chris Cooper, specializes in supporting performances, and he is still producing great work.  The dialogue is smart, often funny, and the actors pull it off splendidly.  The Lake House could have been a sappy, illogical film, but the filmmakers and actors took on this project with such mastery that I couldn't help but be entertained.  The twists in the end are subtle, and they don't jerk the film in another direction; they mainly function along side of the film, going with the natural flow of events.  This is a sweet and well written romance, and it might be one of the best romances in quite some time.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the stone age have always been known for their weird songs, their hard rockers, and most of the time, a great combination of the two. Songs for the deaf is no exception. While most definately harder than rated R, the music is still likely to put you in a trance. This cd has so much talent on it that its hard to believe. You have Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, and, unbelieveably, foo fighters frontman and former Nirvana skin-basher Dave grohl on drums. Lots of talent here. This album is full of instant classics like No One Knows, Go With The Flow, Hanging Tree, Song for the Dead, and Song for the Deaf. Each song is filled with great riffs, intelligent, thought provoking lyrics, and precise but headbangingly good drumwork. The use of multiple vocalists and multiple styles ensures that each song sounds different, but somehow they still flow together flawlessly. Songs for the deaf is a rare achievement in music nowadays: great musicians coming together, collaborating to form an even better whole, and making great, catchy, original music. An A+ in my book, and guaranteed to always be among my favorite albums. Buy it. Now.
0060899190|4.0|There's something revealing about the anonymous secrets - happy and sad, silly and morose - that flood the pages of _PostSecret_. Nearly every reader can find personal associations with at least a few of the secrets Frank Warren has compiled. Perhaps the reason Warren's book is so popular is because those who own it seek to find something of themselves within its pages. The personal trip is well worth the purchase price.
B00005JNRY|4.0|Pixar movies are known for artistic achievements in the fields of computer animation; and for their accesible storytelling, which is even true at the film considered most \\"adult\\" by many audiences: The Incredibles.    Many critics have panned \\"Cars\\" by calling it cliched and predictable, cheesy and formulaic. Yes, it might be cliched and predictable, it might have a lot of cheese and it follows the \\"we-teach-you-sound-values\\" formula. But then, why is it that this movie is striking a chord on many people? Maybe is it because we have precisely forgotten about these values?    In this era and age of Instant Messaging, Blackberry, \\"Date Movies\\" and Tarantino gore, sometimes you welcome an effort like \\"Cars\\". You need to be reminded that we get so stuck in our own goals, our jobs, our careers and where we want to get, that we tend to forget what's important and to take a pause and enjoy all the blessings surrounding us. And that's the message this movie brings us, which is a lot deeper that the \\"talking car\\" facade might lead us to believe.    Lightning McQueen is a hot-shot rookie in the world of stock car racing; he's so much into his own success and arrogance he has forgot the fact no one is an island. He will get a heavy dose of reality while being lost, finding Route 66, a forgotten town, love and friendship; while learning about a place that was scratched off the map because of so-called \\"progress\\".    Sometimes a message like that is stronger if we take the context out of our own backgrounds and place them somewhere else. And that's precisely what Pixar does by bringing fantasy characters that have some credibility on them (talking cars that actually bend and move like real cars) to that context, while not forgetting the comedy and a lot of humor. So many jokes are there you'll need the DVD version to get them all.    The soundtrack is dead on-target, from the rockin' \\"Real Gone\\" by Sheryl Crow, serving as an almost operatic introduction to McQueen to the teary \\"Our Town\\" by James Taylor and a nice version of \\"Life is a Highway\\" by Rascal Flatts.    Yes, the movie is a bit long, but we in the audience at the theatre didn't really feel it; you won't help but feel identified with the characters: my girlfriend and I looked at some scenes in which McQueen and Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) were involved, and we saw ourselves reflected at those characters and personalities (Yes, I'm a tad cocky and career-oriented, sorry folks).    I'm not a fan of Disney movies and I have entirely avoided animation pictures, including all of Pixar's previous efforts, except for The Incredibles on HBO. But something told me I should watch this one, and I am not disappointed. There must be something powerful about an animated movie that makes you put your life into a new perspective, and finish your day praying and thanking God for all the wonderful things you enjoy, most especially your family and friends.    Life is indeed a journey, and there a lot of things to be enjoyed and learned while you get to your destination, including friendship and sportsmanship. And that message some people might call \\"dated\\" to be reflected in movies, is precisely the kind of message I'd like to bring and pass to my children, if I ever am blessed to have them.
B0000020C4|5.0|I encountered Les Miserables through this particular performance. I bought the movie with the live performance and at first thought eww[...] I was not big into musicals and my closest things to musical knowledge was listening to Phantom of the Opera and Jekyll And Hyde. Of course I bought the DVD of (David)Hasselhoff's performance. Point being, this version of Les Miserables changed my outlook on musicals.<br /><br />Colm Wilkinson, Ruthie Henshall, Michael Ball, and the Disney duo of Lea Salonga and Judy Kuhn(both respectively from Aladdin and Pocahontas) and two young performers, children, opened my eyes to the world of Jean Valjean and his fight for redemption. The search of Javere for Valjean only to commit suicide after a conflict of ideals. The death of Fantine and the love triangle of Marius, Cosette, and Eponine. I was totally blown away.<br /><br />I've since performed in two musicals. Little Shop and Footloose, but only because I was so attracted to the genre after watching and listening to this performance of Les Miserables. This truly was the dream cast and I am greatful to be able to enjoy it now.<br /><br />The best part for me was the performances of the songs Do You Hear the People Sing, and One Day More, both which share a reprise at the very end. I put those songs on repeat and imagine I am right there singing in the background. The emotional gathering of the many Valjeans from worldwide performances is the pinacle I believe as they sing a multilingual version of Do You Hear the People Sing, and finalize it with a powerful last chorus of One Day More.<br /><br />Buy the DVD, buy this CD set. Hear these talented artists sing a story of redemption, compassion, love, war. Let the story of Jean Valjean lift your heart and spirit. Allow it to change your life as it has mine.
B000CCD0FI|3.0|This disc and the ones that followed did not age as well as the earlier TH discs.

B000BTJDG2|5.0|When I review a film I ask myself two questions: 1. what did its producers seek to accomplish by making it; and 2. did they achieve their goal?    It's clear that this film was made to disturb its audience.  Since it succeeded in disturbing me I give it a five.  It was eerie as hell, literally!  There is an underlying feel of malevolence that is accomplished through clever use of lighting and other cinemagraphic techniques.  There is strong character development of all the major figures.  There is both internal and external conflict.  The dialogue was exceptionally well written.  In short, the production values were excellent.  The result is a creepy movie that has the power to make even the most skeptical (or devout) among us scared of the Devil.    So much for the \\"beautiful\\" part of the movie.  Now on to the \\"lies.\\"  Simply put, it is a work of fiction based very, VERY loosely on actual events.      The real story is this:  In 1960s Germany there was a teenage girl named Anneliese Michel.  She was born in into an ultra-strict Catholic family that raised her in its pre-Vatican II interpretation of the faith; i.e. heavy on guilt and fear.    In 1969, while attending university, she began to wake in the night feeling paralyzed, with a heavy weight on her chest.  Now, in 2006 her condition would easily be diagnosed as sleep paralysis, a fairly common condition where the brain wakes up without flipping on the \\"switch\\" that allows one to control their limbs.      The physicians she saw were unable to provide a firm diagnosis for her condition.  They eventually misdiagnosed her as having epilepsy and prescribed drugs which proved ineffective.      The failure of medical science to help her encouraged Anneliese to believe her malady was spiritual. Since Catholic rituals failed to help as well she concluded that she was possessed with unusually strong demons, a belief encouraged by family and clergy.    The resulting mental stress was exascerbated by bumbling physicians who prescribed drugs that had deleterious effects on her brain, such as depriving its cells of sodium.  In summary, by the night of her exorcism she was in a semi-psychotic state caused by improper medications and aggravated by her conviction that demons were inside of her.    The exorcism failed to work of course, since her real problem wasn't the Devil but physical and religious \\"treatments\\" which weren't just useless but actually harmful to her.    In the end she died from  one of her medications inducing oxygen deprivation to her body.  In fact the medicine should never have been prescribed.    That is the far more mundane truth behind this dramatic and almost entirely fictional movie.  But don't take my word for it.  Check out wikipedia.com's article entitled \\"Anneliese Michel\\" or just Google the name.  The facts I have shared in this review are extremely well documented.    I say none of this to detract from the film, which was a finely crafted piece of fiction.  Watch it if you want to get goosebumps.  Just don't take it for more than it is.  And remember: the Devil didn't do it
B000FFJ85I|5.0|As a semi-rabid AFI fan of nearly three years, I'm relived to find the group's newest album substantially satisfying. That said, I'm not one of the hard hardcore \\"old-school\\" fans fiercely attached to their very earliest albums (Answer That and Stay Fashionable, Shut your Mouth and Open your Eyes etc...). In fact, I really can only stomach Black Sails and later, so you might say my tastes lean more towards the dreaded \\"radio-friendly\\" ticket. I think it's safe to say that most of the elitists must have fallen off the AFI bandwagon at Sing the Sorrow, or even earlier, so let's not pander and apologize to the snobs.  <br /> <br />Anyway, about the album I'm reviewing. This might be an odd analogy, but December Underground kind of seems to me like the AFI equivalent of Adore, the Smashing Pumpkins' fourth major album. Both Adore and December Underground are the respective bands' fourth major commercial releases, and both mark a turn towards a slicker, smoother, more mature overall sound--especially marked by the use of electronic beats in places (to a lesser extent in Decemberunderground). I know some listeners will interpret this progression as a watering down, or a further selling-out (Sing the Sorrow was a decidedly obvious \\"sell-out\\" album, if you insist on thinking in those terms), although I prefer to think of it as perfectly healthy musical maturation. There's not primal screamo in every single song (as is the case in Black Sails or The Art of Drowning), but there is just enough where necessary. No, the vibrant young boys of AFI have not gone soft, they've just found a new (and in my opinion, more interesting) lyrical and musical ground. There are still the rapid-fire drum rolls, the melodic crunching basslines, the lithe and quirky guitar stylings by Mr. Puget, and of course, Davy's delectable ultra-tenor vocals. But there are also numerous keyboard add-ins, electronic drum-beats, velvety industrial segments and in general a much smoother sound. Call me a Delila-loving old granny (I am pushing 21 after all), but I found the new soundscape compelling and cohesive. In some ways the album's texture is more homogenous than Sing the Sorrow's, but I think this aspect serves to make a more cohesive and \\"album-like\\" feel--something rock bands should work towards as they develop and become more comfortable to record what they want to. Decemberunderground fits perfectly as the next logical step after Sing the Sorrow, a formidable order to fill for such an already revered and respected musical group. <br /> <br />Prelude 12/21: The expected AFI \\"intro\\" track. Probably the most lyrically interesting of all their intros so far. The tinny wind-up toy kind of instrument that opens is attention-grabbing, as is Davey's hushed vocals--\\"This is what I brought you, this you can keep\\". No talk of bleeding or loving one's hate. This \\"prelude\\" is less of a rabble-rouser and more of a personal message. As a song in itself it's not completely realized, but considering its \\"intro\\" status, its quite intriguing and \\"draws the listener\\" in, as they say. <br />4/5. <br /> <br />Kill Caustic: Track two, \\"Kill Caustic\\" is immediately recognized as a throw-back to the glory days (maybe not the very earliest, but TAOD or BS kind of early). Plenty of screamo moments, old fans may feel appeased for a bit. Davey hopes you'll love these screams as much as he does. Lyrically there seems to be some irony going on. Nice guitar hooks in the chorus as well. 4/5. <br /> <br />Miss Murder: You might have heard this on the radio/MTV. Catchy of course, but definitely not one of the album's strongest. Maybe I'm just sick of it, but the chorus gets a little trite after a few listens. Lyrically, it seems not too original (sorry Davey). Luckily this track is not diagnostic of the rest of the album. 4/5. <br /> <br />Summer Shudder: Currently this is my favorite song on the album. The anthemic, hooky chorus is simply delish (sorry), the lyrics are alright. Simply for the melody and mixing it earns a 5/5. Might not have staying power though. <br /> <br />The Interview: The first \\"mid-tempo\\" track on the album. Here, electronicy-beats are apparent (I'm not actually sure if they're real or \\"fake\\"--but they have that techo-esque feel, ya know?) . It's not as attention-grabbing as some of the faster tracks, but its still a good raise-your-lighter kind of power ballad. Also, nice use of choral vocals. Interesting organ fade out with almost gospel-like chord progression. 4/5. <br /> <br />Love like Winter: Very good. Noteworthy, sensual imagery, smart hooks and techno-inspired beats.  \\"It's in the blood, it's in the blood. I met my love before I was born. She wanted love. I taste of blood, she bit my lip and drank my war from years before.\\" 5/5. <br /> <br />Affliction: Another one with a kind of old-timey feel. Another interesting and captivating outro, with smooth keyboard beats and some recording of some crying chick. Overall, maybe 4/5. <br />  <br />The Missing Frame: Another fast-paced, very catchy track worthy of single-status. Has almost an eighties pop-feel at times. 5/5. <br /> <br />Kiss and Control: The fade-in is almost NINish. Reminds me a bit of \\"Clove Smoke Catharsis\\" (just the intro). Morphs into a screamo for the chorus. Interesting, but not as melodic as tracks 3,4,6,8. 3.5/5. <br /> <br />The Killing Lights: Fast-paced, very melodic. Interesting lyrics. \\"It's killing time again. Put on your face and let's pretend these killing lights won't kill us all again.\\" <br /> <br />37 mm: Very industrial gothic, melodic and dark. 5/5. <br /> <br />Endlessly, She Said: A heavy and powerful yet melodic closing track. 4/5. <br /> <br />So go out and do yourself a big favor--buy \\"Decemberunderground\\"--you'll just love it, I'm sure. Cherish it under the summer rain, beneath the swirling auburn and amber leaves of autumn, and especially, in the cold wintry December months. Just like a pair of long winter underwear. With black bunnies onthem.
B00005JP0A|5.0|This film is very funny and entertaining for those who like fashion. The clothes shown in this film are awesome! It was time for a fun fashion film to come up, I think the last funny fashion film before \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was \\"Clueless.\\" Although this film does not have a complex plot or drama, \\"Miranda\\" absolutely adds the spices to the dish, making the film tastefully funny. We need more films like these. I hope they come up with a second part of the film.

B000EDWKXI|2.0|Giacamo Casanova is on the run from the Inquisition for the crimes of heresy, debauchery, fornication with a novice, and numerous others that have all been rescinded in the past.  His luck is running out on him, though, and he has been warned that he must find himself a respectable wife or face the consequences and be exiled from Venice.  This is not necessarily the easiest task for a known libertine, notorious rogue, and despoiler of virgins.<br /><br />That is until he has a vision of the lovely Victoria, a rarity of sorts: a Venetian virgin.  While Victoria's father would prefer that she not fall for the licentious Casanova, his daughter overwhelms him with her requests to wed him.  And so, they are engaged.  All is well until Casanova sees Francesca Bruni, a feminist in her time, defending the rights of women to attend university and be something more than a man's plaything.  He admires her courage and wit and begins to court her--regardless of his pending wedding.<br /><br />I'm taking this movie as a work of fiction and nothing more, so I'll make no comments about the historical accuracy.  The Venice sets are beautiful and the costumes are lovely if a bit inconsistent.  My favorite part of the movie is Lena Olin in the role of Francesca's mother and Oliver Platt as Francesca's errant fiance, Paprizzio, lard king of Genoa.  As a whole the film was fun to watch, with numerous comic sequences, but I couldn't help but wish the plot was a little more consistent.  It seemed to jump all over the place and there were just too many cases of mistaken identity for me to take it seriously.  Overall, I think it was okay, but don't expect too much.
0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a terrific insight into Lincoln's abilities as a true politician.  It was an amazing feat by Lincoln to pull together such a diverse cabinet and to make it work. Doris Kearns Goodwin does an admirable job highlighting the machinations of the White House during this crucial time in American History and shows how Lincoln was totally in charge of his administration, although others felt that they were running the show.  Lincoln was a shrewd lawyer and politician as we are finding out.  The idea that Abraham Lincoln was a bumbling country bumpkin can be put to rest for now.  Goodwin does a wonderful job showing how Lincoln was able to pull together his cabinet and get them to work together for the most part.  I beleive that this will be a pivotal book on the scholarship of Abraham Lincoln and his presidency.
0060934913|4.0|This book kept you on your toes.  Anthony Bourdain describes, in sometimes too much detail, the inner workings of the kitchen of restaurants throughout New York City.  He was a success...he was a failure...but whatever he was, it was always entertaining. <br /> <br />His book is interesting because 98% of the general public only see the inside of a restaurant dining room.  They see the nonruffled waiters.  We see the host.  For all of the serenity of the dining room...Bourdain quickly introduces us to the mayhem that exists behind those doors of the kitchen. <br /> <br />If you are offended by sexual talk and escapades, then this book may overwhelm you.  If you are offended by strong talk and colorful language, then this book may bother you.  If you take this book for what it is worth--an inside view of a chef's life and willing to roll with the punches, you are in for a wild ride. <br /> <br />There were several chapters that were of great interest to me--A day in the life of the chef.  Reading about their crazy hour schedule makes you appreciate their food and their work even more.  It is not an easy life.  Predictably, one of my favorite chapters was discussing what not to eat and when to not eat certain foods like No Fish Monday.  If you like old fish that has sat around for 4 days, then Mondays are a perfect time to order the fish. <br /> <br />The authors experiences in Baltimore and Tokyo were also both interesting as well.  The one thing that I enjoyed reading was how he described his failures.  He did not pass the blame.  He blamed himself for accepting jobs.  He blamed himself for taking the money instead of taking a job that he felt he would succeed it.  It was an honest declaration. <br /> <br />The book is a good read.  Bourdain does not come off particulary really likeable but he comes off as human and thats important to note.  If only the television show could have been as good as the book...maybe if they moved that show to cable, it could have been.Well done, errr, I mean, Medium done job Mr. Bourdain.  I just may have to track down some of your other works.  Thank you.
B00005JP4U|5.0|One reviewer wrote: <br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------------ <br />\\"The Ice Caps are melting!! Sea levels will rise!!\\" Really? Such drivel shows a real lack of scientific understanding. Ice caps are after all, floating ice. Not a land mass. To see how water levels will rise try this little scientific experiment. Take a bowl. Fill it half full of water. Add a lot of ice cubes or a block of ice. Mark the level of the water once that is done. Let it melt. Note the water level has not risen because the ice melted. Duh!!  <br />------------------------------------------------------------ <br /> <br />Now, if that reviewer actually saw the movie, he would have seen the same experiment reinacted on the screen.  The problem isn't the ice that's already in the oceans melting.  The problem is, when that ice melts, the 'dam' or barrier to the land-based ice is removed and that land-based ice then flows into the ocean raising sea level.   <br /> <br />Do the above experiment and then add a handfull of ice and watch the water level rise. <br /> <br />The facts that Mr. Gore presents are strong and well thought out.  I do hope that people listen and collectivelly try to change.  However, that won't be the case.  People seem to need a disaster to incite action.  The threat of terrorism was just as real before 9/11 as it was after, but it took that disaster to incite action and in some cases overreaction. <br /> <br />The movie is a great documentary even if you don't believe in the subject.  It is well thought out, humorous in just the right places, and makes its point clearly.  This film reinforces in my mind that entertainment can also be educational. <br /> <br />If you don't believe the science presented here, then present the facts and citations, but the reality of the situation is that I believe humanity will have to be dealt a catastrophe greater than 10 'New Orleans' type disasters in order to rid our addiction to fossel fuels and the production of greenhouse gasses. <br /> <br />Oh well, it's only our children who loose.  What do we care?  We'll all be dead by then.... if we're lucky.

Darcy is engaged to Dex, and there's a love triangle with her childhood best friend Rachel, who is the epitome of the \\"good but ugly\\" girl.  Darcy works a glamorous job in PR and dates only the most eligible men, while Rachel works as a lawyer and doesn't date much.  It was all just too stereotypical for me - I thought that nobody could be as bad as Darcy and still be engaged to a nice guy, and nobody could be as good as Rachel.<br /><br />So, on to this book - I loved that it showed Darcy as human.  She's trying to pick up the pieces of her life after Dex calls off the marriage and starts dating Rachel.  She escapes to London where her problems only follow her, and she finds out that she needs to look inside and change herself in order to get what she really wants.<br /><br />This book is really great - I could clearly see the development of the writing and characters.  The conflicts were much more realistic and complicated, just like in real life.  I highly recommend this book!

0875847706|5.0|I saw Ben Zander at a company event and it's the only time I've gone out and bought a book based on any corporate presentation. Ben was amazing and transformative! I know every person in our audience was moved by his examples and insight. The book is a great how-to guide to changing your view of life and how to live the way life is meant to be lived - with JOY! I love the to-do items and the easy, reference guide layout of the book.
B00003CX9S|4.0|This remains a wonderful movie some two decades after its debut!  After watching the DVD twice, my grandkids had me look up information on the real Elephant Man, Joseph Merrick. <br /> <br />The special features provided quite a bit of interesting information on the making of the movie, too.
B000683VI4|5.0|\\"The Notebook\\" envelops you and despite my best effort I became completely and totally submerged in the film.  This is a movie that makes you believe in love again.  So many of the stories we hear about in the news today are stories of hate and violence.  This movie does a fabulous job of taking you out of that world for two hours and making you understand that true love still can exist. The story follows Noah and Allie from their young life together as teenagers until their death together in a nursing home bed.  This is touching especially since in our world today divorce is becoming commonplace.  I realize that it seems like I think the world is some horrible and sad place but I really think the opposite.  Having a movie such as this to watch can remind us of the positive when we might be overwhelmed by the negative. When I first saw the film, I had not yet read the book by Nicholas Sparks.  I think it is interesting because the book opens with both main characters, Noah and Allie dying, but the movie ends that way. I think I would have been disappointed by knowing the ending first in the movie because this removes the feeling of suspense.  Despite that main difference both pieces (the film and novel) mirrored each other.  Why change something that is so great?
B000FP2Z0S|3.0|This is another solid effort from Rise Against. The band explores similar musical territory to what they've already covered in \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\" and \\"Siren Song...\\" If you enjoyed those albums, you'll enjoy this one. If you disliked those albums, there is nothing to interest you this time around.  <br /> <br />However, if you have never heard any of Rise Against's previous efforts, this is arguably their most accessible release to date. Pick this one up, and if you hunger for something more abrasive and challenging, go backwards through their discography, starting with \\"Siren Song...\\", then \\"Revolutions\\".
B000F7CMRM|1.0|If your reading this review right now, chances are that you are considering buying or renting Syriana. Depending on whether you like Syriana or not revolves around one question : Have you been actively following Middle Eastern geopolitics for the past 20 years? If yes, the let your thoughts remain unchanged. If no, then stop reading this review, save your money, and dont consider watching this film unless your hobbies are flushing money down toilets and wasting time. <br /> <br />Heres a quick test for your knowledge if you cant formulate a yes or no answer for the above question. Years ago, Saudis captured some American Stinger anti-aircraft missle launchers but ran out of batteries to use them since they were American made. Did you know about that? <br /> <br />Syriana is basically about Middle Eastern geopolitics. And no, Im not talking about stuff like \\" Oh well some Middle Eastern countries are part of OPEC which exports oil to other countries \\". This movie mainly focuses on the governmental aspects of the exportation and profiting from oil.  <br /> <br />The problem with this film though is that there is too much storyline to digest. Syriana falls into the uncluttered category of movies where you must zone out all outside distractions and concentrate only on the movie in order to understand what is going on. The plot is similar to a car race- if you dont pay attention to the race for a few seconds, then you will be left in the dust. There are just way too many characters in this movie and subplots that will confuse even some of the most endearing moviegoers. <br /> <br />Matt Damon plays a solid role as the resident Einstein of geopolitics while George Clooney somewhat remains quiet for most of the film. <br /> <br />Its a shame because Syriana seemed like a good movie if you could understand it, but the plot escalates into a confusing mess for two hours. If you want to give the film a try, you are falling into a hit or miss situation whether you like the filmor not.

1892005034|5.0|NVC picks up where Harville Hendrix's Imago techniques left off. My husband and I now have tools for far more than just our relationship together. We've used NVC techniques for decision-making and found a win-win solution to a complex problem that left everyone feeling like their needs had been heard and addressed, if not completely met.  This alone was worth the price of the book! <br /> <br />I think the NVC work is deceptively simple, but not at all easy.  It's taking a lot of awareness on my part to respond differently from my habitual ways.  When I do, the results are amazing.  To paraphrase the Rolling Stones, I don't always get what I want, but I get what I need. <br /> <br />No conflict necessary to enjoy the benefits!  I'm discovering that NVC even works with acquaintances who, after all, just want to feel heard. <br /> <br />I really, REALLY wish my parents had communicated this way with me when I was growing up.  But hey, it's not too late for me to change myself. <br /> <br />I will be getting the NVC home training CDs as soon as it comes out.
B00005JNRY|4.0|The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  \\"Cars\\" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this \\"vehicle,\\" I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see \\"Cars.\\"  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.<br /><br />Much like \\"A Bug's Life\\" and \\"The Incredibles,\\" \\"Cars\\" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the \\"Blue Collar\\" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.<br /><br />While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, \\"The Incredibles.\\"  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.<br /><br />Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I must say, that V for Vendetta is the best movie i've seen in years. A true story of what government can/is becomming. As well as containing a bit of romance. Though, I do urge anyone who has seen the movie to read the book. It will make you understand the movie even better as well as changing the way you think. (though please get the novel not the graphic novel) it's just easier that way.  <br /> <br />\\"even though i do not know you. even though i will never meet you. laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you.

B000EQ4G5K|1.0|Lucky Barbadian born R&B/reggae singer rihanna, has reached new levels of anoying with her sophmore effort entiled 'A Girl Like Me'. Rihana's voice and ablum is so rediculously terrible and anoying, they deserve a prey.    God in heaven please let a record company sign some with actual talent, who can really sing, who is really pretty and doesn't just wear tones of expensive make up and weave.    Let there be a new artist who has something to bring people who actually like real music.     Rihanna is wack and I actually like beyonce' and think she is extremly talented (did you see the bet awards). Rihanna sounds like Beyonce minus talent, years of experience, vocal training and constant practice as a child with Destiny's Child.    Beyonce get 5 stars, no talent rihanna gets 0 stars.    Music Lovers if we are lucky by this time next year we won't remmember the musical mistake that was rihannah.
0743201140|4.0|Taking the strengthsfinder inventory is fun.  I learned some things about myself.  You have to be honest when you answer the questions, so if you don't know yourself or have a false self-concept, the results are invalid though--that's a drawback for any self-report instrument.  It would be better if you could take the test yourself and then have your spouse/partner and/or a close friend to complete it as well, responding to the questions with you in mind---then you could compare the results and be more assured about the profile.  Of course the main drawback is the price of the book.  I'd have purchased several copies for my friends had the price been lower.  (You know how the joke goes: How many copies of a self-help book does a co-dependent buy?  Two--one for herself and one for a friend)  Overall, I had a great experience with the book and strengthsfinder.
0743454537|4.0|Overall I liked this book a lot and definitely recommend. I won't re-summarize the plot as that's already been done in plenty of other reviews, but some of the ethical issues it introduces are quite interesting, and it manages to explore them without becoming preachy or obvious. The story itself is interesting and engaging, I whipped through this book in two days, and I usually read books over a couple of weeks.  <br /> <br />One thing I must mention...and based on the other reviews I gather most readers will not agree with this, but still...I found some of the characters to be somewhat obnoxious. Julia and Campbell, in particular. Julia's entire character seemed to be based around her flying off the handle and shrieking like a harpie at every opportunity, I found myself dreading any scene she appeared in. Even Anna flip-flopped between being suspiciously precocious and somewhat snotty, although in this case the character was interesting if not always lovable. <br /> <br />Overall, an interesting read, despite a couple of characters you might want to smack.
B000A59PMO|5.0|VM is a well-written, suspensefull and smart dectective series.  Episodes are interesting and absorbing, plus the overall story arc from week to week gets and holds your attention.  It's much better written that Lost or 24 or any of the other programs that are on TV currently.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book by Harper Lee. The story is very believeable and feels very realistic. The story may be a little dated, but still has many life lessons that pertain to today.  <br /> <br />The story revolve around Scout and Jem, the son of a lawyer in the 1920's small town, southern US. They face many childhood events including a \\"haunted house\\" and school play. However, they find themselves faceing many challenges when their father represents a black man on a rape charge. <br /> <br />This book really shows what racism was like in the South in the past and how it could effect anyone. <br /> <br />This book is a classic and everyone should read it.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I've seen this movie now so many times I don't think its a love story anymore.  It's a fear story. <br /> <br />This is the story of how some people can be utterly controlled by the fears they have.  To me love didn't conquer all.  It is a story about how bigotry absolutely does produce results and in this story, death and loneliness were the results produced. <br /> <br />If you are a man that isn't gay, I can understand how boring it would be.  But if you have ever done anything that you thought could produce your death were it to be known and the combination of angst and anxiety that it brings despite the joy Ennis and Jack shared, then this movie does it well. <br /> <br />I thought Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for his performance because he brought so much depth to the role.  And for these two straight guys to feign this passion so realistically really shows how great they are as actors. <br /> <br />There were too many technical mistakes in the movie to rate 5 stars and I thought Jack's \\"first time\\" went awfully smoothly so a little downgrade for lack of realism.  But for movie buffs, a watersched movie, for gay-themed movies, a must have.

And that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is when the Air Raid klaxon goes off, and wan, shadowy twilight turns to Hell-backlit insanity: when the very paint of reality peels like rotted skin and everything burns, when you run screaming through blocks of charred hellscape from cackling insanities that refuse to die, when you have to barricade yourself from a landscape that boils and bristles with Death and Madness.<br /><br />You know, right about the time, if you're hapless mommy Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell, who looks great in a skirt), you start making a list of Things to Do, and it reads somethin' like this:<br /><br />1) Don't Adopt<br /><br />2) If you do Adopt, and the kid sleepwalks to the edge of a Cliff, then *do not* decide to check out the town the kid is always yammering about; and finally<br /><br />3) If you do ignore Rule #2, then you better have a pretty damned big boom-stick.

Apparently there is an alternate world of whacky characters living below London's subway tunnels including \\"openers\\", lethal bodyguard adventurers, and the lost, confused main character (the guy next door) and a conman's con-man for good measure. Neil Gaiman's books are always an adventure.  ENJOY!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What a truly accessible adaptation this is.  P&P is one of my all-time favorite novels, so I'll be the first to admit that there is great license taken with some of the original content, perhaps particularly where characterization is concerned, but overall I think any changes made were reasonable and well-considered, and I can't quibble with them.  Most of the acting is excellent.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  The more \\"rustic\\" take on country life in Georgian England works very well , in my opinion.  This version is much less precious than any others I've seen, and of any others, this one alone does a decent job of portraying the attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy that is the center of the story.

B00005JP0A|4.0|Ok I give it 3 1/2 stars. Totally predictable film. But charming in its own way. The character \\"Andrea\\" reminds me of Audrey Hepburn. Say what you want about Meryl Streep but she totally is great here, and you forget it is even Meryl Streep and believe she is the hard biting career driven woman that she portrays in the film. It also makes one think about ambition versus love. However, the \\"other lover\\" storyline was totally unnecessary and who would leave their cutie pie boyfriend for that self centered monster?

0385338686|4.0|Of all places that I found a copy of this book was at the library rummage sale ~~ I never have much luck in finding chick lit at garage sales or rummage sales ~~ and this one was just a pure lucky find.  <br /> <br />I have read most of the Shopaholic series ~~ and while they were entertaining, I didn't relate to the shopping sprees. This one, I did relate to ~~ being a workaholic and all of a sudden finding yourself in a new territory that involves laundry, vaccuming (or hoovering) and cooking ~~ unlike the main character, Samantha, I quit the \\"rat race\\" when I got pregnant with the boys. It is definitely a different lifestyle than I had. While my previous career was nowhere as high-pressured as Samantha's was ~~ it was still different.  <br /> <br />Samantha ran into the countryside in a daze when she realized that her error cost her client 50 million quid because she didn't file the paperwork to secure the loan in time. She was up for partnership at a very high-brow and expensive law firm. She had worked her tail off for seven years after law school to get in the firm and had no life other than being attached to her Blackberry, her mobile and her everlasting cup of latte in her hand. She sweated and worked her way to the top only to have one memo destroy all she worked for. Then she finds herself in a quandry when she shows up at a mansion outside of London asking for a drink of water. Somehow she finds herself as a housekeeper.  <br /> <br />The incidents Samantha has with all the cooking gadgets, laundry and hoovering ~~ all sound familiar to me and they are funny!! Even when she falls in love with Nathaniel, the gardener, it wasn't trite (even if it was predictable) and it was sweet ~~ this book really was a fun book to read and I thoroughly enjoyed it much more than the Shopaholic series. It's more true-to-life than her other books ~~ and more likeable.  <br /> <br />This is a great book to read anytime ~~ and especially if you're going to be at the airport or on the plane ~~ it's a fun story with a romantic overture and more grown-up than her other books. (Meaning, less whining ...) <br /> <br />This was definitely a lucky find for me.  <br /> <br />7-9-06
B000E5KJF2|3.0|This was an entertaining for the most part, but tried to be a little too clever at times.  Robert Downey JR plays a petty theif who goes to LA and gets thrust into acting.  A murder mystery develops, but it seems mostly just there to provide a vehicle for Downey Jr's jokes and stunts.  The movie had several parts that dragged along, but unfortunately it is already too short to cut more out.  The picture quality is OK, but I still hate combo discs-I want to see HD DVD with minimal compression!  Worth renting, but nothing more.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|From the trailers, I thought the special effects of this film would be absolutely stunning and I was not disappointed in that respect.  I suppose since it was so visually rich, the producers didn't feel the need to have a plausible, coherant story to go with the visuals.<br /><br />The lack of script leaves the actors with nothing to do when we aren't being dazzled by the vivid colors, futuristic weapons and vehicles. The fight scenes look like a John Woo acid trip.<br /><br />Jovovich has done much better in the acting department and certainly we have come to expect more from Fichtner, but we can't blame them for the material they were given to work with.<br /><br />So, if you watch this, go into it wanting pure eye candy and not to get any sort of story to go with the view.  Otherwise you will be very disappointed.
0553714546|5.0|We love Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  We have the 1st four on CD now. <br /> <br />It is good to actually begin to see the transition from Scotland to America and the upheaval that happened in that time prior to the American Revolution.  So often we get an English Centric view of that time.  So often we look at only the French and Indian War - which was actually called the 7 years war in Europe - and go no further.  Diana begins to tie in events in Scotland, England, France, and the colonies, and how they flowed from events in Scotland. <br /> <br />Since I have always loved time travel and science fiction, I enjoy the interplay between the present and the past, and the historical research showing what goes on in the past.  I thought her loops of information were interesting too. <br /> <br />Since I have done some geneological research, I am well aware of the tediousness at times, but the joy in the discovery as well.  I thought she did a great job in adding this to the story. <br /> <br />I love the way she brings customs of the time to the forefront, like witch trials, french court manners, travel documents, \\"Hand Fasting\\", and the gathering of the clans to name a few. <br /> <br />The one thing about her books that I don't like is the one sexually explicit scene in each of the books so far that I could have done without.  The Black Jack Randall interegation in the \\"Outlander\\", the visit with the French King in the \\"Dragon Fly in Amber\\", the Plantation Scene in \\"Voyager\\", and the Rape Scene in the \\"Drums of Autumn\\".  These scenes actually were not just gratuitous, and they actually were critical to the story.  But it certainly made it hard to listen with kids in the car. <br /> <br />Dan McMillen <br />

So often we get an English Centric view of that time.  So often we look at only the French and Indian War - which was actually called the 7 years war in Europe - and go no further.  Diana begins to tie in events in Scotland, England, France, and the colonies, and how they flowed from events in Scotland. <br /> <br />Since I have always loved time travel and science fiction, I enjoy the interplay between the present and the past, and the historical research showing what goes on in the past.  I thought her loops of information were interesting too. <br /> <br />Since I have done some geneological research, I am well aware of the tediousness at times, but the joy in the discovery as well.  I thought she did a great job in adding this to the story. <br /> <br />I love the way she brings customs of the time to the forefront, like witch trials, french court manners, travel documents, \\"Hand Fasting\\", and the gathering of the clans to name a few. <br /> <br />The one thing about her books that I don't like is the one sexually explicit scene in each of the books so far that I could have done without.  The Black Jack Randall interegation in the \\"Outlander\\", the visit with the French King in the \\"Dragon Fly in Amber\\", the Plantation Scene in \\"Voyager\\", and the Rape Scene in the \\"Drums of Autumn\\".  These scenes actually were not just gratuitous, and they actually were critical to the story.  But it certainly made it hard to listen with kids in the car. <br /> <br />Dan McMillen <br />
B0000027RL|4.0|Pearl Jam, along with Nirvana, were the strongest bands in the grunge era.  In fact, they were grunges main selling groups.  Pearl Jam has managed to stay a vital band some 15 years, and 8 albums later.  Nirvana couldn't handle their success and of course you know what happened to them. <br />Pearl Jam has the sound of a garage band and this seems to be one of their strong selling points. <br />I recommend this cd as a strong introduction to PJ.
0345444051|5.0|I like the story line of Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 science fiction novel, Childhood's End.  The writing was not particularly outstanding, but it was not bad, either.  I liked part I of the book much better than the parts II & III.  I identified better with Stormgren than with Jan Rodricks or George Greggson.  When I learned part I was most of a previously written short story by Arthur C. Clarke virtually unchanged (\\"Guardian Angel,\\" from 1950), my preference for part I made sense.  I tend to prefer the classic science fiction short stories to the novels.  I like Ray Bradbury's and Philip K. Dick's short stories better than their novels, as well.   <br /> <br />Childhood's End is very thought provoking, and that is why I rate it at 5 stars.  I do not call it profound, because if the author makes a point, I did not get it.  The narrative leaves the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about the story.  I read this 240 page book in two days and have spent the next two weeks pondering it.   Typically, once I finish a book, particularly a work of fiction, I do not spend a lot of time afterwards thinking about it, much less jotting down my thoughts on it (currently at four pages).   <br /> <br />The weaknesses in narrative and characterization that the critics love to point out are the reason I have spent so much time thinking about the book after I finished it.  I want to fill in the blanks and connect the dots, but in reality cannot.  Perhaps that is the point.  The story has aliens with alien thought processes that mankind might never have the capacity to comprehend.  It challenges the concept of a universal or conventional belief system and the notion that there is a truly unbiased method to judge competing belief systems.  The only way I found to make sense of it all was to start with the premise of self-interested aliens, and that casts the entire story in a different, darker, light. <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|There is nothin g to say except what a great and outstanding job they did making this cd. Lateralus is by far the best tool album ever. I wished 10000 days was more like this one, but it turned out to be disappointing. Unlike 10000 days, Lateralus lacks absolutely nothing and beats out any other album ever made.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I still own the original DVD release for this film which sports the great panavision 2.20:1 aspect ratio... how can you offer a new and better special edition of a film like this and use a Pan/Scan version beefed up by new audio tracks? Who ever was responsible for this should have been fired immediatly nbo questions asked they obviously have no love for the original aspect ratio of any film let alone Annie. What a waste of a release and time and effort.
B000EULJLU|4.0|First of all, what's with the name? 10000 days?? Compare that name to Lateralus or Opiate. It just doesn't fit in. But with the album itself, pretty good job. I personally like the song Jambi just because of the heavy riffing throughout it. I like that song way more than Vicarious. As a matter of fact, i like any song more than Vicarious. Yeah, it's their 'big hit', and everyone seems to love it...well its one of their worst. Rosetta Stoned is another good one. For some reason it reminds me of A Perfect Circle. Don't know why. Right in Two is a well-done song, but it seems to get on my nerves if i listen to it more than once a day. Every other song on this album is alright. Vicarious is definitely the worst. But to jump to a hasty conclusion, this album is 'changed tool'. Maynard doesn't seem to sing as loud anymore, and justs seems to whisper in every song. It was still a good album, but lateralus was the better of the two..since everyone seems to be comparing them.
6305971935|5.0|Stories of traveling through time are always fun, and should be just that since the physics and potential long-term repurcussions of time travel and causing changes to past events do not appear feasible given present knowledge. So, throw away the analytical side of your mind and just enjoy the story of a Naval experiment at the height of World War Two gone awry, and how that experiment repeated in modern times connect with disasterous consequences. The film is supposedly based on an actual event, which has been shrouded by some degree of secrecy and conjecture, but did not involve time travel. However, the thread of reality helps with the \\"what if?\\" atmosphere the movie portrays. Among the highlights are a terrific performance by Michael Pare and Nancy Allen, as well as kudos to the casting director for finding actors to portray characters \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" who are very believable in their roles. Despite a prerequisite car chase, explosions, and other cliches from movies released during the 1980s, there is a good story here, making this a film well worth your while (the sequel was awful and should only be used as \\"Mystery Science Theater\\" fodder). This DVD offers a very clean version of the film, with the only suggestion for improvement being a short feature on the contraversy surrounding the actual \\"Phildelphia Experiment\\" and whether the U.S.S. Eldridge was actually transported briefly from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia as has been reported.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Someone did an astonishing job in transferring these shows to DVD. They are anamorphic 16:9 and look gorgeous blown up with a front projector. Not HD, of course, but as close as any DVD I've seen. Even nicer that each episode really does feel like a movie, as others have noted. If HBO et al spent a $100 million making Rome, couldn't they help finance another few episodes of Firefly?  It would come with a committed audience already in place.
B00009N83Y|4.0|I loved this movie and I feel its very under rated. Yes the story was a little on the weak side but there was some fantastic action, good comedy and a wonderful setting. Too bad it didn't do well in the box office because a follow up would have been awesome.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I really have no complaints about this album, it's more or less the best thing I've heard in any mainstream circulation for years. Cee-Lo's vocals are nothing short of incredible; he puts the plethora of carefully packaged contemporary \\"rnb\\" singers to shame with the sort of addictive delivery that characterized classic soul music in the 70s.  <br /> <br />DangerMouse has improved greatly, in my opinion. I've been a fan since the Grey Album , but I felt his beats were a little too scattered and frenetic at times (case in point: Dirt Off Your Shoulder). DangerDoom was a little smoother but still a bit inconsistent. On St. Elsewhere he has perfected his unique approach to production and demonstrates a much better flow or groove than was present on his earlier stuff. Cult fans need not worry though, as he has not let the accessibility of the music dillute his madness, strange samples and unexpected glitch-y drops abound. One of my personal favorites is \\"Just A Thought\\" that has monstrous overdriven breaks crashing away in a Ming & FS sort of way beneath Cee-lo's dramatic, introspective vocals and a wash of ambient pads and noises, unexpectedly jumping out in a strange rhythmic call-and-response. His uncanny sense for stitching together wierd samples and scrappy beats into catchy riffs is better than ever, and recalls the free-wheeling days of the early 90s, when electronic musicians were unabashedly tossing together any source of sound they could put into a microphone. Such creativity has been dulled by the irritating pretentiousness of the current scene.  <br /> <br />With this near-flawless blend of incredible singing and profoundly creative songwriting and production, the mediocrity of modern pop music is brushed aside. Hopefully up-and-coming talent will take a cue from this collaboration and realize how far music can be pushed with a little imagination, something that the increasingly irrelevant RIAA and it's stable of over-produced pop acts seem to have forgottenlong ago.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I absolutely love this set.  I never watched it when it was on HBO, because we didn't have HBO.  I'm actually glad I didn't, because now I can watch as much as I want in one sitting.  Sometimes I even stay up way past when I should go to sleep, because I am hooked on it. <br /> <br />I love it that it is all in one case.  It looks great on my bookshelf.  I also love that is has the acrylic cover so that it will stay in good condition for a long time.
B000FGGE68|3.0|I really wanted to like this more than I did, but the creators missed a lot of opportunities to make a memorable and long lasting film. Ultimately, it falls short of that and lands right in the run of the mill pile.<br /><br />ULTRAVIOLET is NOT a waste of time. It has some phenominal technical moments. Not to mention, some very cool and memorable fight scenes and special effects. Milla Jovovich looks very believable wielding swords and battling hords of attackers. She's also very cool and gives a solid performance. In fact, the entire mood is engaging.<br /><br />So, where does Ultraviolet fall short? There are many things, but I believe the most important thing is that the movie plays like a VIDEO GAME STORY.<br /><br />You may say, \\"It's supposed to. It's a video game movie.\\" But, turning a video game into a movie is a chance to give a different dimension to a video game character. Video game stories are usually very one dimensional. Find bad guy after fighting through hords and levels of his henchmen and eventually destroy him. That is exactly what you get... the movie plays like levels... and if you've ever heard the term \\"Hack and Slash\\". That is what the movie is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I love the action. I love the battle scenes. But, it just seems to be one after the other. One immense battle scene after the next, and when it's all said and done.... there wasn't much of a story to be told... just like a video game.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me was the beginning... the movie has to explain the world... the virus... the new species... the side effects... the war that is raging... and then I noticed... WE'RE ALREADY 10 minutes into the movie!!  Dear lord! Tighten this script up man! Movies should grab you in the first 5 minutes. And then, after the 10 minute explanation... you're thinking, \\"Is this the second coming of DUNE? Is the movie gonna be that complicated?\\" And as I've already said... it isn't.<br /><br />This needed more side stories. More emotion. More character building. More essence, more dread and less Milla Jovovich taking on 30 bad guys at a time... 7 or 8 times... or maybe it was more than that. However many it was, it felt like watching SOMEBODY ELSE play a video game after the 2nd time.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been more fun had you been able to control the action with a controller... but ultimately, ULTRAVIOLET sort of falls flat. It's a cool looking movie with a very hip Milla Jovovich giving it her all, but with a very one dimensional story that leaves you with an unfulfilled taste in your mouth when it's all said and done.s.

B000003TAR|5.0|I really dislike Generation X with their smarmy, pseudo-intellectual, arrogant attitudes towards everything.  They pretend to be concerned about the world around them, but it's all for show, like life is one big photo-op.  Most of the films and the music of the 1990's reflected this.  But listening to this album again (which I've always liked) made me realise that Cobain was one of the real artists alive in that generation.  He poured his heart and soul into his work.  There is no \\"irony\\" in his work.  There is no detachment.  This is a real artist who shared his gifts with all of us.  He felt so much, and you can feel it in every note on this album.  I like the noisy quality of this CD, and every song is a masterpiece.  They were all written by Cobain himself (sans one, which he co-wrote), which explains the higher quality of the album.  It's a f---ing waste that Kurt killed himself, because he was a real musician/artist in a time where hype was everything, and art came second.  He felt too much, probably.  Rest in peace, Kurt...
B000BVD460|4.0|This item was purchased for my husband to go along with the new woofer system as I usually don't listen to this kind of music.  I'm more of a Korn and Disturbed kind of person.  However, after listening to this CD, I cannot get enough of it.<br /><br />What I love about Eminem's style is his honesty about his life in many of his lyrics instead of the typical \\"gangsta\\" lyrics.<br /><br />Though some of his songs are quite comical(FRACK) - Marshall does have a very serious and apparently caring side of him that comes out in songs like Mockingbird.<br /><br />All I can say is he's got a new fan!
0060899190|4.0|This item is okay, pretty much as I expected.  There are a few pages where you can't really read it because they tried to put one postcard on the two pages, and that's really frustrating.  Other than that, it's okay, though.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|After three years having released their first cd, Three Days Grace has blessed us with their sophomore release and it has proven to be well worth the wait. Not straying too far from the desperate, suffering sound of their self-titled album, One-X has proven to be just as good, if not better, than the first. From the broken helplessness of 'It's All Over' to the haunting melody of 'Get Out Alive' all the way to the perfect finish with the title track 'One-x', this album has proven to all of Three Days Grace's fans that they're not just another one-hit wonder. <br /> <br />With 'It's All Over', you hear talk of drug and substance abuse and just how crippling this habit can be. Though you wouldn't suspect such a dark topic to be a sort-of album starter, the first track of the album proves to be the perfect way to kicking off their album.  <br /> <br />Onto 'Pain', you hear talk of a sadistic and risqué subject matter, though presented in a clever, subtle fashion. A song like that only leaves you wondering - does Adam Gontier really like S&M? <br /> <br />Next up is 'Animal I Have Become', the first single released from the album. It premiered before the album did, and it caught everyone's attention, sending the message out far and wide - Three Days Grace was back. It's desperate tone and catchy lyrics make you pay attention to just what they had to offer, and in my opinion, was the perfect way to kick off their album's release. <br /> <br />Following 'Animal' is 'Never Too Late', probably one of the most moving songs on the album. The slow start leads to a powerful chorus, \\"Even if I say it'll be alright/still I hear you say you want to end your life/Now and again we've tried to just stay alive/Maybe we'll turn it around 'cause it's not too late, it's never too late\\" For me, this was the tear-jerker of the album. It sent me to a very personal time in my life, and I found it hard to stop listening to. Very powerful, and very moving. <br /> <br />'On My Own' comes afterward, and it's personal lyrics give you a very intimate feel of it. Talk of being \\"just a big disgrace\\" and \\"[being]too much\\" suck you in and refuse to let you go as you enter a very lonely world that makes you feel the intensity of it. With this song, a very lonely cloud falls over the album as you begin to connect with Gontier's lyrics and voice, feeling his pain. <br /> <br />With such a down-er type of song, 'Riot' brings the energy back up and picks you up out of the slum that the previous set for you. 'Riot' seems to portray the rage and betrayal that most fans of Three Days Grace and similar bands feel they have had too much for one to experience in a lifetime. So why not start a riot after being \\"stepped on\\" and \\"let down\\"? <br /> <br />Another personal favourite, 'Get Out Alive' has a haunting melody following Gontier's equally-haunting voice. Though it's slow rhythem brings down the pace that 'Riot' set up, it leaves you wondering about your future and just where you stand - whether you'll \\"fade away\\" just like the characters described in the song, or whether you'll \\"make it to the otherside.\\" <br /> <br />The perfect break-up song, 'Let it Die' portrays perfectly just about every teenage romance that, unfortunetly, tends to end in dispair and in a rut. The very widely-known topic is perfect for listeners as they connect to the subject matter and begin to feel like a kindred spirt to Gontier as he leads you through the once-blissful relationship now just left in a pile of rubble. <br /> <br />'Over and Over' proves to be the perfect anthym to anyone with a crush that they just aren't sure about. It's lyrics bring out the very confusion of the matter, but also the warm-and-fuzzy feeling in your very soul when talking of just how much you do care for the person. \\"Why do I do this/over and over, over and over?/I fall for you/over and over, over and over/I try not to\\" Well, I fall for this song \\"over and over\\".  <br /> <br />With 'Time of Dying', Three Days Grace proves to the world just how serious of a band they are. It's powerful and moving lyrics connect with fans, as I've seen and experienced first-hand, and is the tear-jerker for the majority of those who listen to it. It brings to life a time in someone's life when they need help, and conveys this to the listener in a spectacular way. One of their best songs to date. <br /> <br />As we start to come to a close with 'Gone Forever', we hear Gontier in, almost, a new light. This song is very touching, and I hate using that word because it's so ... positive. But this song has a very positive tone underneath it all - liberation. It's a little slow, but that really makes no difference in the quality of it at all. It's a very moving piece, and should be treated as such. This song, in my opinion, reveals to us the very epitome of recovery - learning how to live with such a pain, and starting anew from it. <br /> <br />And the album closes with 'One-X', the title track of the album. With all the isolation, loneliness, rage and desperation, this track brings a new emotion into the album - unity. It brings together everyone who has been affected by the album, listened to its words and connected with its lyrics, and unites each and every one of them. \\"We are one\\"  <br /> <br />- Are you with us?
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is the animated film by Richard Linklater, the talented writer and director.  I had heard so much about it before, but just recently had the opportunity to see it myself.  The acclaim for the film wasn't unwarranted.   <br /> <br />The movie's main character fades in and out of dreams and \\"waking life,\\" rarely being aware of weather or not he's awake or sleeping and in the end I'm not sure if it really matters.  Adding to the dreamy theme of the movie is the beautiful, hazy animation which drip-drops and flows from scene to scene giving the audience a light, floating feeling like we're experiencing the surreal dream world as well.     <br /> <br />Along the way the main character (I'm not sure if he's ever named) encounters a myriad of interesting characters espousing various philosophies, religions, ideas and theories.  The main character is seeking answers to whether or not he's dreaming, awake or even dead and each of the people he meets give him some insight, however vague it might be.   <br /> <br />Linklater himself makes an appearance at the end of the film and his speech on sci-fi author Philip K. Dick and the role of dreams in his novel, Flow My Tears, the Policeman Cried.  Linklater's retelling of Dick's story captures much of the film's message...I'll leave it to you to see for yourself and draw your own conclusions from Linklater's masterspiece, Waking Life.   <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I am not a Chili Peppers fan but when I heard these CD's I was bowled over by the beauty and diversity of both CD's. Powerful is the only way I can describe the pure pop and rock essence of this release. I have been touting it as one of the best rock albums ever. Not just recently, ever. I have not been this bowled over since O.K. Computer and Lateralus (Radiohead and Tool). These guys have injected a pop/rock formula into their veins and are kick [...] with every aspect of this album. There is not one weak track out of 28. I listen to a lot of different music (everything) and I cannot help but be effusive about this music. It will stay in my player most of the summer. I refuse to dissect this record because I am enjoying it too much. Sometimes one simply has to surrender to the experience and let the tears flow in the beauty of it all. This one is an instant classic regardless of what others say. Can't wait to see these guys live.
0812550757|2.0|Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.<br /><br />Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I first started hearing cuts from the new Muse Cd a few months ago from different blogs/radio and was shocked to hear new sounds that were not traditionally done by Muse. The new album is wonderful and original. It is clear the band is exploring new avenues of music such as Elvis, Queen, and even hard-core rock. It is neat to hear a beloved band experiment with different sounds and break the mold created by themselves.  <br />I highly recommend the Cd to all fans wondering what it would sound like if they tried something else other than Prog Rock, but for old fans who just want another same ol' Muse avoid this like the plague. <br />Good job Muse for realizing we love your music but it is time to start exploring other avenues. <br />-Devout Muse fan since 2000
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I just started watching Everwood this past weekend, and it is one of the best shows I have seen. It really sucks that it got cancelled. I really hope the remaining seasons will come out very soon, cause i would like to continue on and see what happens. I also know that there is alot of people working very hard to get the show back into the fall line up. I wish them the best of luck and I hope the CW comes to their senses.
B000FMGTTE|2.0|I actually read all of the reviews regarding this soundtrack and I must echo the sentiments of Koray Savas, M. Johnson and Todd Heer. John Ottman is a much better editor than composer. I listened to the CD twice before writing this and I have to agree...the true composers back in the day knew how to write for the movies and the orchestras they were going to be working with. If it weren't for the John Williams' melodies, I doubt if this soundtrack would even exist. The grandeur that is Williams' trademark - something special is happening (or about to happen) comes thru loud and clear, even in this version conducted by Ottman. Unfortunately, when Ottman's original tracks begin to play, there's no grandeur, no continuation of that \\"special\\" feeling. They come off as lightweight, fluffy and as one person put it, \\"filler music\\".  Those original tracks could've easily fit in his soundtracks for X-Men II or Fantastic Four. And yes, with the use of the chorus, there are definite influences of Elfman, and others. Nothing truly original here at all and definitely nothing special about his themes being in Superman Returns. They're mostly forgettable. <br /> <br />As another reviewer put it, if you want to hear a wonderfully orchestrated soundtrack, get the original Superman soundtrack by John Williams. If you're a Superman fan, you'll get this one \\"for the files\\" but odds are, you'll gravitate to the original soundtrack. This one just doesn't cut it at all.
B00005JOVN|5.0|The most fun I've had this summer. The ship turns over quickly and then from then on it's just one exciting thing after another. Seeing the wave on the IMAX screen was incredible and when the ship turned over people were screaming! This was great!
B000FVHJE4|4.0|I couldn't get over how this guy did SO MANY drugs and is still alive! And in relatively good health it seems.   He certainly is a master at taking narcotics.  Most people would have OD'ed I think.  I wouldn't know a song by the RHCP if I heard it, but being a reader of biographies, this one sounded juicy....sex, drugs and rock & roll most definitely.  I got a bit tired of reading about drugs and more drugs and every time I thought he had it licked he  went back.  Like he says-insanity. It's got to be. Girlfriend after girlfriend, wow.  His story continues.  I would be curious if he's EVER yet found true love and how long his sobriety and drug free time is.  I don't think he'll ever be totally free until he finds the True Higher Power, but there's still time. Well written, very interesting. Quite unbelievable but then a lot of musicians end up this way.  I don't think they are good role models for our children. They are so nonconformist. I don't envy their lives at all.  At least he didn't seem obsessed by having lots of money eventually.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|It is great to see Dylan put into perspective of the folk movement that occurred in the late 50's and early 60's that includes so many great names like Pete Seeger, Liam Clancy, Dave Van Ronk and Arlo Guthrie.  Whereas Scorsese built the story of The Band around The Last Waltz concert, here he takes his time, exploring the ins and outs of Dylan's storied early years, showing how this kid from Minnesota exploded onto the folk music scene, able to absorb and assimilate both the music and the social events of the time.  Seeger quickly picked up on this young talent, who like Dylan's obvious musical and social reference, Woody Guthrie, was able to capture the mood of the time.  Scorsese intersperses the documentary with a number of amusing anecdotes, the best delivered by Liam Clancy.  Concert footage is edited, but then there are a number of concert DVD's available of Bob through the years. You won't be disappointed.
0440241588|1.0|This book is really bad. I can't figure it out. We all know John Grisham can write, so how come he decided to waste both his own and our time with this absolutely worthless pice of junk? Very odd. It is bad from beginning to end.

B00005JNEI|5.0|First off let me say, I enjoyed watching this documentary. Do you want to know why? Well, the answer is simple, it is because it wasn't the same old sugar coated garbage you hear on the corporate owned news. This documentary is insightful, and an eye opener, how you take it is entirely up to you.<br /><br />I have read some other reviews, naturally, because I wanted to see what others thought about this documentary.. I must say, blindness must run rampant around here..<br /><br />One comment was made, something along the lines of 'Oh, I was in Iraq and everytime a soldier dies it seems like Moore is doing it.' .. Oh, well that's nice, that comment made me cringe. What kind of blatant statement is that? Moore did not send the soldier's to Iraq, capitol interest and neo-con greed did.. Oh wah wah I know it's a tough thing to hear, and I know it would be easier to just deny it. It is funny how people still believe that our president truly believed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and that was enough to plunge the country into near civil war. Companies most closely allied with the administration are 'strangely' profiting immensely from the war.. hmmm, the only people benefiting from this war.<br /><br />It is truly a tragedy in this country when near half of the population have to lie to themselves to feel comfort.<br /><br />Oh and about the bashes against Moore saying he is fat, #1 - that is a low blow without any real merit, #2 - he is an American, and 50% of America is fat, welcome to America.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is a wonderful family drama primarily about the relationship between a teenage boy and his father after the mother died in a tragic accident.  It is the first year of Everwood, which the CW cancelled this program after only 4 seasons.  Everwood is very heartwarming, realistic, and entertaining - with the best writing and acting I have seen on TV in a long time!  I highly recommend it!  I would love to see Seasons 2, 3, and 4 on DVD also!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The Beatles are in my opinion one of the worst bands ever, why are they so popular? They have only made 2 decent songs in Hey Jude, and Ballad Of John and Yoko. YELLOW SUBMARINE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD. THIS IS EVEN WORSE <br />THAN GREEN DAY. BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUSIC BUT GOOD MUSIC <br />IS FOREIGNER GOT IT? THEN SHUT UP...ALL BEATLES ALBUMS SUCK SO AS ALL ALBUMS FROM OTHER REALLY BAD BANDS LIKE ACDC ROLLING STONES LED ZEPPELIN AND PINK FLOYD. THANKS, AND DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE DISASTER.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I've never been a great fan of the Batman movies..although I did enjoy Jack Nicholsons' Joker...so, naturally on renting this movie the expectations were not very high.  To my surprise this was such a good movie we ended up buying it.  This is by far and away the best Batman movie yet.  It is jam-packed with so many great performances that it's a treat to watch over and over again. There is Christian Bale's pensive Bruce Wayne..soul searching through mysticism to become Batman.  Michael Caine as the intelligent save-the-day butler Alfred.  Liam Neeson, who always lights up the screen whenever he's there, as Ducard.  Gary Oldman as the skeptical Officer Gordon.  Cillian Murphy as the creepy Dr. Crane.  Katie Holmes as the inquistive Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes.  Rutger Hauer as the \\"didn't you get the memo\\" Earle and the always good Morgan Freeman as the scientist technical advisor Lucius Fox.  With all this star power, the actors could have easily overpowered the movie.  Fortunately each role was kept in check leaving the Batman character room to develop properly.<br />What is really impressive is that there are no bad performances in all the movie.  They finally got all their ducks in order and made a  Batman movie worth watching.
B000AL730O|1.0|I don't know what everyone's raving about. This album is by far his worse ever; even Press to Play's innovationations have some kindal of tonal sense. This is a real mess. The only thing that sounds like a well-constructed song is the song \\"Fine Line\\"
0201433079|5.0|The book evolved from its first edition and its definitely a mammoth task trying to keep in this edition what is relevant and what isn't but i think the authors did it :)<br /><br />If you want to be a UNIX Guru, then this is definitely the book for you :)

B000007MVM|5.0|Syd Barrett was a poet and genius of the highest order.  Fragmented and tattered, the songs on this album lay it all out on the table.  This is the reflection of a man who was dying on the inside and who's reality was slipping away literally as he sang.   <br /> <br />Songs like the opening Terrapin and the closing masterpiece Late Night seem to speak volumes of the feeling of disassociation he must have felt in his life at the time.  And, the truth is, every song in between the two are more than worth the their weight in gold.  Jaunty tunes, such as Love You, Here I Go and Octopus, mingle with material that is, for a lack of better words, absolutely soul crushing.   <br /> <br />The production is fittingly sparse -- some songs are literally just Syd and his acoustic (Dark Globe, Feel, If It's In You), while many others are filled with small psychedelic flourishes that keep the ambience intact.  The only low point on the album exists in the admittedly weak She Took A Long Cold Look.  This song would have found a better home on the B-sides collection Opel (ironically, the song Opel would have been a perfect fit).  Long Gone is a darkly chilling highlight -- chromatic acoustic scalings, thick harmonies, and dynamically interesting organs make for a particularly sinister song. <br /> <br />Syd's voice is often broken and fragile.  On songs like Dark Globe, it is on the verge of sounding tortured.  This IS NOT a pop album and it IS NOT an extension of his more whimsical Piper At The Gates Of Dawn album.  Be forewarned: this is an album that will haunt you for years to come.   <br /> <br />-This review was written in his honor.  We will miss you. <br /> <br />So long, Syd.  (January 6, 1946 - July 7, 2006)-
B000AY807Q|5.0|I bought Neil Young's 33 1/3 album, 'After the Gold Rush,' in April 1972. Until April 2006, I had had no further contact with his music. At that time, I just by chance chose to see the documentary, 'Heart of Gold,' at a movie theater in Knoxville. It was a captivating experience. I felt I had been lifted into the presence of honest, powerful art and pure poetry. I buy few DVD's and own few; this was one I had to have. Now I am in danger of over-playing it and wearing the edge off my enthusiasm.
1400079179|4.0|Okay, honestly the only reason I picked up this book to begin with, was to find out what all the hype was about. From the moment I read the first sentence I could not put it down! I'd find myself eagerly awaiting 5 o'clock each afternoon, not just because I was getting off work, but so I could read more! My ultimate goal was to finish this book prior to the release of the movie. Now I wish I hadn't! This is another case of the book being so much better than the movie! But that's neither here nor there. Anyway, Dan Brown is a skilled author. His writing is easy to follow and very descriptive without being overly \\"wordy\\". I absolutely adore Robert Langdon as a main character! He's like Indiana Jones in a tweed jacket!
0385507755|1.0|A million little pieces is the kind of book that people who do not read like. <br /> <br />They like it because, for the most part, it is intriguing. It is not, however, an accurate portrayal of what Frey was going through at the time.  <br /> <br />As has been recently uncovered, many of the feelings, stories and allusions in \\"a million little pieces\\" were, as Frey states in the notes from the author in the new version of the book, \\"embellished.\\" This word means stretching the truth. A better one might be \\"fabricated.\\" <br /> <br />Although i have no doubt that the author suffered though various experiences relating to detox and rehabilitation, i do not believe they occured in the extent described, and i do not think they he had as much strenghth as it seemed like when he was dealing with these situations.  <br /> <br />James Frey comes across as, though he has addictions, a strong person. But, one has to be extremely weak, malleable and deficient to become addicted to drugs, as he was. Frey had two parents with good jobs, a nice house and a nice life. He should have turned out normal. But that's not the point.  <br />  <br />Severe addictions to drugs and a strong personality do not go hand in hand. There are countless times in the book where Frey just seems like he is lying about how he was coping with his disease. His musings made him seem like a person who knew right from wrong, when in fact, he did not. Although Frey might have different opinions now, ones that mirror those in \\"a million little pieces\\" he did not, in real time, when he was in rehab and having to deal with things like getting root canals without anesthesia.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is, Frey inaccuratly describes the way he coped with going through rehab, and those who do not notice that in the book are not very well read. People read this book because the cover looks inviting, they see all their friends reading it, and they think drug addictions are intriguing.  <br /> <br />The author admits himself in the new copy of the book that the events are \\"embellished.\\" So, to everyone out there and especially those who do not read often, I advise you to put \\"a million little pieces\\" back in the fiction section and pick up a real biography.
B00005UD0O|5.0|This is a very good John Ford Western, which is untypical of Ford in many ways. It has a claustrophobic feel about it and it seems unusual that it was shot in black & white (by William Clothier) in 1962. On one hand John Ford was always concerned with Eastern vs. Western values. Most of Ford's Westerns have always been about bringing law and order to the West in which ultimately progress and not guns achieve that dream for society. Ford's vision of that dream is much darker here. In this film Ford creates a darker dream thus not allowing elements of the dream to expand into the legend.  Thus, the visual claustrophobic feel bolsters that idea and reality of an aging and wiser filmmaker.<br /><br />John Wayne quietly underplays his role. James Stewart as the idealistic Eastern lawyer who is robbed on the way West, goes to work in the town of Shinbone as a dishwasher and eventually brings law and order to the West unknowingly through the efforts of Wayne. Lee Marvin as the villainous and evil Liberty Valance is one of Ford's most violent screen incarnations. Edmond O'Brien and Ford veterans Andy Devine, John Carradine and the incomparable Woody Strode are all featured. Set designers Sam Comer and Darrell Silvera did an excellent job on the Shinbone sets, especially O'Brien's newspaper office. John Wayne, Ford's mythological hero, and his performance are for me the cornerstone of this film. As elements of an Eastern based society overtake the untamed West, the old dream comes to a conclusion and with it the mythological hero of that dream must end as well.
B000002UA0|5.0|Great listen, not up to \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" but outstanding nevertheless. <br /> <br />By the way, it seems Syd Barrett just died at the age of 60. <br /> <br />Founder of one of the greatest bands ever, he will be missed greatly. <br /> <br />R.I.P. Syd

B000FVQYZY|5.0|I looked forward to the release of this album with great expectations, and my expectations were fully met. Muse's fourth CD seems to slightly outshine the band's previous album Absolution, but comes a bit short of the spectacular albums Origin of Symmetry and Showbiz. Still, Black Holes & Revelations should satisfy any loyal Muse fans out there with its catchy hard rock jams and heartfelt softer pieces. As usual there are plenty of neat musical patterns to enjoy, with electronic voices in \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", mystic synthesizers in \\"Take A Bow\\", and low-toned throbs in \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". Like Muse's prior albums, Black Holes & Revelations gives the impression of a variety-filled performance which overall almost seems like a musical drama coming right out of the CD player, and with each song having a significantly different sound the music constantly succeeds in holding your attention. The first four songs are probably the most appealing, though the last song, \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", is definitely one of Muse's best for its use of horse sounds, synthesized rhythms, and catchy main line when three different sounding recordings of Matt Bellamy's voice are played on top of each other for a very neat-sounding end result. \\"Map of the Problematique\\" cleverly uses an electronic guitar pattern to set the rhythm for a great hard rock melody, and is reminiscent of my favorite Muse song \\"Citizen Erased\\" from the Origin of Symmetry album. The very first song \\"Take A Bow\\" sounds like something you might find off Absolution, using the fast-paced synthesizers evident in \\"Apocalypse Please\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" towards the beginning, but veering into an electric guitar slam in the middle which makes it one of the best tracks on the CD. Then there is the great song \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", which is a hit I believe and reasonably so, for it has superb guitar riffs and Matt Bellamy uses a tone of voice which almost sounds like Beck, who I am also a big fan of. Muse has never reallymade a song like this one, whose use of whispers, electronically produced voices, and different tone of voice for Matt Bellamy produces an almost completely different sound for the band which is just as good as a typical Muse single. Overall, Black Holes & Revelations is an outstanding album which is necessary for any fan of Muse to own, and for that matter any fan of rock.  Fans of Keane who have a hard rock side also would likely appreciate this album also, especially for the song \\"Starlight\\" where the melody and vocals sound a lot like something Keane would come up with. As for the DVD, it has a cool design and the live performances are somewhat interesting. The best portion of the DVD is the \\"Extras\\" section, where you can find live performances of songs not on any main Muse album.I would give this album a full five star rating and very much think it is the best CD to come out yet this year, though The Strokes and Three Days Grace have recently released awesome albums as well. Don't delay to purchase this CD, it's an amazing album!

B0000A1RJI|5.0|this soundtrack is terrific. for those of you who saw the first movie i think you'll agree. buy it so you can experience the excitement of the movie from your car : )!!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I just had to get my in 5 star rating.  'This is us' and 'Red Staggerwing' are worth the price of admission on this country tinged cd.<br /><br />I can't call it a true country release but country music influences flow through each of the tracks.  So those of you who want to hear some flawless harmonies and excellent music don't have to be scared away if you're not a country fan.  Remember, Emmylou spent time recording with Dylan and others in the world or rock.  And we all know how great Mark Knopfler can be.  I'm just hoping we get more from this team.
0375836675|5.0|When I finished reading 'The Book Thief' I felt at a real loss as I did not want it to end. And this book is not any different. Markus Zusak not only writes very well, he captures your imagination in ways that prevent you from being able to live beyond the book! Set aside a couple of days and read this book. Tell your friends you have a really bad cold and can't come into contact with people for two days at least. Be willing to smell from a lack of showering as you will not want to put this book down. A great read!
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses' debut release Appetite for Destruction is a truly monumental album.  The 80s are in many ways the best decade for heavy metal.  Albums such as Back in Black, Number of the Beast, and Screaming for Vengeance, Master of Puppets, and Shout of the Devil are some of the landmark metal albums of that decade.  Appetite for Destruction for me only comes second to Back in Black.  There are a lot of reasons why this album is so monumental.<br /><br />Granted the music foremost the main reason for this album's greatness. Can one count how many times he or she has heard Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, or Sweet Child of Mine on the radio?  I think Sweet Child of Mine has to be one of the most overplayed rock songs.  Every song on this album is pure hard rock goodness.  Granted I was only nine years old when the album was released, but I remember hearing Paradise City being blared out of cars while I was walking home from school.  I had no idea that 4 years later I would be blaring it from my stereo in my room.<br /><br />An interesting aspect to this record is that it appealed to all different kinds of hard rock/heavy metal listeners.  During the mid 80s there were people who listened to glam rock and people who listened to the new wave of British heavy metal influenced bands.  Appetite for Destruction was an album both groups listened to.  If someone listened to Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth GNR was hard, edgy and tough enough to enjoy.  Yet their soft side would also to appeal to glam rockers as well.  However, lets just say from someone like me who likes all kinds of metal they were not glam.  But Axl's looks did attract a lot of women, and he was enough of a bad a--for the men to look up to also.<br /><br />It was Axl's bad attitude however that in the end destroyed this wonderful band.  As Ozzy Osbourne stated Guns N Roses could have been the next Rolling Stones.  I completely agree with this statement.  Luckily Slash and the gang has put out some pretty good material since the break up.  But it's hard not to wish for once was.  Who knows maybe one day?l since the break up.  But it's hard not to wish for once was.  Who knows maybe one day?
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I was a bit afraid that Muse might dissapoint me with a new album that since earlier this year they've been hailing as \\"different\\" and \\"more upbeat\\". <br />The great news is that this album explores new musical territories without letting anyone down. Muse still sounds like Muse and their musical identity is intact. <br />For those who expected something different from their trademark melancholic sound, this is the perfect album. <br /> <br />I would even dare to say that this might be their best work to date, even thought their 3 previous studio albums are absolutely superb.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|i can't stop listening to it! definitely a different direction for afi when compared to their early albums, but it's just the next evolution for this incredible band. yet another genre defying release, you can still hear the punk roots mixed with beautiful lyrics and melodies, piercing screams, and electronic effects. my favorite tracks: kiss and control, the killing lights, the interview, love like winter... i could list every track on this album, the whole thing sounds great to me!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|The theory is \\"Music soothes the savage beast\\". This theory is represented in Corinne Bailey Rae's voice, it is quite soothing. She has been compared to everyone from Billie Holiday to Norah Jones, I think her voice is unique the listeners must let her grow, without lifting her to high or bringing her down to low, it's only her first album, come on already. I enjoyed (1)\\"like a star\\" (4)\\"till it happens to you\\" (bluesy) (5)\\"trouble sleeping\\" (upbeat tempo)and she switches to a little more funk in (9) \\"I like to\\". Her CD is a breath of fresh air to a music industry in need of oxygen. The epitome of serenity. I look forward to her growth as an artist. Finis.
B0000A9D1F|5.0|As a fan of Nickel back  this is the bomb, I wish more bands bunddled DVDs with CDs or put both video and thier tracks on DVD.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I am the last one who would buy a country CD-but I loved the movie & the music was just as memorable. I only wish some of the instrumental pieces were longer. I often skip from one instrumental piece to the next. The songs take me back to the amazing scenic beauty of the movie. The music is hauntingly beautiful & mezmerizing.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed this roantic comedy. Although this is a fictional film, the actors, costumes, and beautiful views of Venice makes this movie very entertaining to watch. Despite being a womanizer, you can't help but to love Giacamo Casanova!
B00006LLLN|5.0|For any country-music-lover out there this is a must have album. Full-packed with great songs, and they play them so well live so you barely notice any difference with the studio tracks on other cds. Hard to say any particular best song on this there are many great songs.
B00005JP0A|4.0|This summer's hit for mature moviegoers is \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" starring Meryl Streep as the proverbial boss from hell.  Streep has a field day playing Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway, an influential fashion magazine.  Miranda is an insensitive, self-centered, sarcastic, and overbearing megalomaniac, who expects her employees to devote themselves to her, 24/7.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is Andy Sachs, a naive and unprepossessing young woman who yearns to become a serious journalist.  By some miracle, she lands a job as Miranda's assistant, a position for which she is spectacularly unsuited.  First of all, Andy is a fashion disaster, preferring staid skirts and sweaters to designer outfits.  She lives in a dumpy apartment and is chronically short of cash.  In addition, she is a kindhearted and easygoing woman who adores her live-in lover, Nate, and enjoys hanging out with friends.  She is the last person one would expect to become a successful gofer for a sadistic egotist.<br /><br />However, the formula dictates that:  1) the plain duckling must become a fashionable swan 2) she will become so obsessed with pleasing her boss that she neglects her loved ones 3) she will lose touch with the values she has always held so dear.  The script, by Aline Brosh McKenna, is breezy and filled with amusing one-liners.  David Frankel directs with brisk efficiency, giving the audience little time to ponder the story's lack of logic.  The movie looks good and is tightly edited, and the actors all perform with verve.  Hathaway is effective as a woman who is forced to decide what she really wants out of life.  Stanley Tucci is wonderful as Nigel, a man for whom fashion is a religion at whose altar he fervently worships.  Nigel mentors Andy and helps her survive Miranda's onslaughts.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, looking chic and sleek, steals every scene in which she appears.  Whether she is throwing her coat and bag at her assistants, wrinkling her nose disdainfully at her staff's ideas for a fashion layout, celebrating a victory over a hated rival, or showing her vulnerability when her personal life falls apart, Streep is perfection.  \\"Prada\\" is great fun and delightful escapist entertainment.y at her staff's ideas for a fashion layout, celebrating a victory over a hated rival, or showing her vulnerability when her personal life falls apart, Streep is perfection.  \\"Prada\\" is great fun and delightful escapist entertainment.
B000002H97|4.0|I'm not really a Metallica fan. I've always liked the Black Album from them which is pretty good with terrific songs in ENTER SANDMAN, Unforgiven, and GOD THAT FAILED. Get this along <br />with albums from Dire Straits, Foreigner, Nirvana, GNR, Aerosmith <br />, and Joe Walsh but avoid all albums from awful bands like THE <br />BEATLES, ZEPPELIN, ROLLING STONES, PINK FLOYD, AC/DC, and BOSTON <br />who suck.
B00004Y28Q|4.0|I'm not an expert on classical/baroque/Bach and had never heard of Simon Preston, but I am impressed with the set of 14 CDs for Bach's Organ works. The one area I was disappointed, was that the organ(s) used seemed weak - perhaps not resonant enough? Other than that I was pleased with this puchase.
B00000DGUY|4.0|This is a pretty darn good album from Dire Straits but most people complain because 'Money for Nothing' is edited! Well I don't mind. A compilation that has 'Heavy Fuel' is the best to <br />get if you are new to Dire Straits. It is missing a couple songs <br />like 'Telegraph Road', and 'Expresso Love'. It would have been complete if those songs were included. I like all 14 songs on this album but they seem better on the other albums, just because <br />they're not edited. Especially Sultans of Swing rocks! My favorite tracks are the beginning, 'Tunnel of Love', 'Lady Writer', 'Money for Nothing', and 'Heavy Fuel'. 'Private Investigations' is probably the weakest track on the album as well. I will recommend this album to anyone who dosen't have it <br />because it is quite good, especially for beginners, go get this <br />great greatest hits album with Making Movies, and Love Over Gold <br />today from this great band. Dire Straits will always be a great band.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|What a throaty but delicious voice young Corinne has.  I heard her on late night TV recently and I was surprised that I really liked how she sang, not only that, I liked the songs she was singing too!<br /><br />I loved the song Put Your Records On, it was so charming and surreal and Trouble Sleeping was equally as good, not only that but both the videos were eye catching and very 1940s to 1950s to look at with bike rides in the country and visits to a basement jazz hall by a sultry looking Corinne who reminded me of a 21st century Nina Simone.<br /><br />All the songs on this Album are pretty good, Corinne has done very well for one so young, and I look forward to watching her mature, I just hope she doesn't become too full of herself, I think if she does, she will loose some of the sparkling charm which makes her a cut above other artists of a similar ilk.
B000003TA4|5.0|Wow!! I like Nirvana sure a lot better than Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Who, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Queen, Boston and other crappy bands. They follow up to other terrific bands like Dire Straits, Foreigner, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, and Metallica. Kurt Cobain is a pretty good singer though he screams <br />some. I don't mind. My favorite track on Nevermind is In Bloom. <br />Get this, but avoid the terrible ABBEY ROAD by THE BEATLES. <br />Thanks. <br /> <br />ROCK AND ROLL WILL NEVER DIE.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I didn't even recognize Pearl Jam's first single, World Wide Suicide.  It was fresh and rockin!  I thought this may be a new sound for them.  But I was disappointed, most of the CD is slow, typical sounding Pearl Jam songs.
B000002J09|1.0|This is it, Led Zeppelin is mostly a band for loosers. I can't belive any one could like them as each and every album from them sucks. I hear them all the time on radios too. What is it with Led Zeppelin? Their singer just screams. Don't buy any of the albums of Led Zeppelin or any other albums of Beatles Rolling Stones Pink Floyd and AC/DC. Go with Nirvana Nevermind insted.<br /><br />PS. Led Zeppelin is for babies. Do you know what I mean by that?
0452282152|3.0|Girl with a Pearl is a lovely one evening read. A nice break in between the conspiracy theory novels. Don't rush this book, it ends much too soon. Interesting relationship dynamics. Purchase from a used book store, or you may want some of your money back.
B000028U0Y|4.0|Johnny Cash's voice is unique.  Its warm, smoky, subdued yet powerful.  His songs of sorrow and wit make you feel like you know him personally.
0440236738|5.0|Are these Harlan Coben books just about right for reading on an airplane flight?  I think they are.<br /><br />In this one, the dead bodies pile up so fast that you really may want to make up a little scorecard to keep track of them all!  It may not help you that much in figuring out who did what, but at least it will let you know where things stand.<br /><br />We see folks try to unravel the mysteries in this fast-paced thriller.  And there are a bunch of impossibly close calls for some of the characters.  It all adds up to an exciting book that I definitely recommend.
0060926317|5.0|Very funny to this one new age, tree-hugging, sensitive, spiritual kinda guy that so many people would be strongly moved to anger by reading MM's book(s).  Strong work invokes strong passions and deeply hidden fears.<br /><br />And so, having read this book many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, I'm buying another copy to share with my western-trained physician girlfriend who has no issue with looking within herself and to other cultures to find Truth.<br /><br />The details of the vehicle for the message aren't so important as the message itself.  Every being and book on the planet has faults and one can rip anything apart.  Look within (yourself and This book) as a way of finding what it is we (americans) are so afraid of, and how simple and elegant Truth really is.  The intense passions of the other reviewers should tell you how important it is to see for yourself NOT whether the details of this book are accurate, but what \\"Message\\" it is Marlo Morgan is trying (and Inspired) to convey.  The message itself is Real, Accurate, and Appropriate.<br /><br />Get over your fear
1400102057|1.0|If you were nurtured on the original recording by Anna Massey, prepare for great disappointment.  Not only does the reader, Donada Peters, pronounce English with an American accent, she has failed miserably to capture the true spirit of Austen.  This should be funny.  It is sadly dull.
B0000062FN|5.0|I bought this in 1970, the day I turned 13.  I'd heard some Santana because my Spanish teacher would play some earlier (and slightly mellower) Santana in class (in a small town in Indiana).  Having never heard anything like it, it took time to grow into, but man, it is a wicked piece of work and one of my absolute favorite albums of all time.  Just listen to the rhythm guitar bits and other rhythm section work as you also take in the extraordinary guitar solos (\\"Taboo,\\" for example).  Not to mention the polyrhythms (as in the hand-clapping juxtaposed with the call-and-response guitars in \\"No One to Depend On\\").  I consider much of the album a masterpiece -- especially the first three cuts!  You HAVE TO listen to this!
0316172324|3.0|This book appears to literal, rational, linear thinkers to be an experiment of disorganized pseudo-intellectual dissertation about rational and irrational thought by a master of the latter. Although I'm also one who isn't likely to stay inside the box, the direction I take when exiting the box is a different one. Therefore it didn't really hold my attention as I worked my way through it in a time-constricted world because I wanted to move on to something else. It's like ice cream flavors: one either likes spumoni or one doesn't.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of my two favorite movies/series of all time.  My family and I LOVE this series.  We've watched it together several times and now we are watching it with our cousins.  I love how we follow EZ Company from training thru the end of the war and it is very touching to see & hear the REAL men who were part of WWII.  God bless them (and all war veterans) and their families with His Peace.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Multiple levels of funk. This collaboration goes to all ends of the spectrum, except western and classical concertos! Lots of flavors here. Mojo is hypnotizing-got all my buds singing the chorus when it plays. If you like hardrock, rap, alternative or punk, or just crazy mixes (i.e., Beck) you will really dig this one. Patton dominates even though unique collaborators on each song, would have been a little more interesting to hear more obvious signature vocals from the others out front. He adapts,blends well with all those on cd, no matter what their flavor. Can't believe a few of these songs don't get airplay on rock stations, etc. Especially Mojo-it's my new anthem.
B00005JOSS|3.0|While the pacing of the film and acting of Keanu Reeves (minus the small amount of time spent with Sandra Bullock, at which time he miraculously woke up) threatened to drag this movie down, the beautiful cinematography and graceful story couldn't be denied. Several times it threatened to become overly sappy and stupid, but despite the sometimes ridiculous dialog, it succeeded in not making me sick, and even left me with gorgeous images of trees and water...Also, they really improved the ending (from the Korean original), making a true mobius strip of time that satisfied the need for some logic despite the total impracticability of the plot. Personally i love time-travel romances and if you like that kind of thing (such as Kate & Leopold) then you've probably seen this - if not, i recommend it.

B000FILW86|5.0|This time they got it. \\"Rockford\\" is classic Cheap Trick, combining the best elements of their entire recording career. The song craftmanship, chops, melodies, high energy, witty lyrics, attitude, and swagger is back. Everything you love about Cheap Trick is all here. Every song is a gem.          From the opening blast of energy and optimisim, in \\"Welcome To The World\\", to the infectious, driving \\"Perfect Stranger\\", to Beatles/ELO/Kinks flavored guitar pop- \\"Dream The Night Away\\" and \\"Every Night And Every Day\\", to straight no-chaser Hard Rock-\\"Come On, Come On, Come On\\", to the ballad \\"All Those Years\\", to the raw 'n' funky \\"One More\\", to the vintage '79 rocker sound of \\"Give It Away\\", and the edgy paranoia of \\"Decaf\\" -which is a killer rock track-everything here works. The ballad \\"O Claire\\" is a real treasure, with a stunning John Lennon meets Jeff Lynne arrangement. \\"This Time You Got It\\" and \\"If It Takes A Lifetime\\" are as pure Cheap Trick sounding as anything they've ever done. This is melodic, upbeat, power-pop at it's very best.        \\"Rockford\\" not only buries their previous cd, \\"Special One\\", but is easily their best album since \\"All Shook Up\\", and even tops the high spirited, guitar driven 1997 \\"Cheap Trick\\" release. It's incredible that they could make such an amazing new record, even after being around 32 years, and performing 6,000 gigs!             They are simply the best rock band in the world. If you love Cheap Trick, you will love this, no questions asked. A big thanks, and congrats to Rick, Robin, Tom and Bun E, for recording this masterpiece.     They should be in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame ~ Hello Cleveland!?   Cheers,    Mike A.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Ok, nobody liked my Red Hot Chili Peppers review, I doubt anyone will like this either.  Even though I'm a huge RHCP fan, and even though I'm a huge Tool fan.  Because people will read any criticism of this album and immediatly click \\"NO\\" this was not helpful.<br /><br />I'm prepared for that.  Now with that said, give me a chance.  Tool has given us 4 amazing albums before this.  I would even say Lateralus was their crowning glory and cemented them in my top 5 bands of all time.  But then I think Maynard got a liiittle distracted with his Perfect Circle project (also another great band).  And the members of Tool got a little tired with Maynard's ambiguous loyalties.... and what we have here is the proof.  If the proof is in the pudding, 10,000 days is the metaphorical pudding.<br /><br />This album has 2 emotions:  one is like a sexually frustrated, repetitive, constipated sentimentality.  Loud thundering drum beats, with repetitive riffing.  And yes it can go on for up to 5 minutes per song.  No harmony, no melody, no transitioning... just thundering, droning noise.  The other half of the CD is full of passive, Perfect-Circle-inspired singing on the part of Maynard.  Loong fillers, sampling, and loopy, almost non-existant guitar picking.<br /><br />There are about 3-4 solid \\"songs\\" on this album.  The rest is just noise and filler.<br /><br />I still love Tool, and I've listened to this cd about 4 times.  It's OKAY.  It's not horrible, I don't hate it, but considering that the album before this was Lateralus, the bar definitely dropped... and it dropped hard.<br /><br />Keep in mind this is all coming from a major Tool fan.  Just telling you how it is before you go spend your money.  I think this is another band that should have retired.  You can heard the drummer's annoyance with Maynard in the lackadaisical, repetitive beats which basically cripple this entire CD musically.<br /><br />And the lyrics?  I am just speechless as far as that goes.<br /><br />Straight from the hip.../> <br />Straight from the hip...
B000FVQYYK|5.0|After almost 3 years absence (well - less if you count in the long Absolution-tour), Muse are finally back with their eagerly anticipated fourth studio album, titled 'Black Holes & Revelations'. Let's just make it clear from the start: the album is phenomenal! Muse have on this record made some slight departures from their trademark sound, while still utilizing their strengths and thereby still sounding like Muse. The new influences seem to come from the dance-influenced rock music of Franz Ferdinand and their contemporaries. Also, several of the tracks contain some southern, flamenco-like guitars, possibly explained with Matthew Bellamy's new residence in Italy. On the lyrics front, Matthew also have incorporated new ideas. Whereas his old lyrics were hysterical, paranoid and apocalyptic, his new lyrics are hysterical, paranoid and apocalyptic - but now, the politicians and leader's of the (western) world are now to blame. This newfound political angle goes hand in hand with some of the most direct love-songs ever penned by Muse. <br /> <br /> <br />List of tracks: <br /> <br />1. Take a Bow: <br />The album kicks off with this synth-laden track. Galloping arpeggio-synths race along Matthew Bellamy's falsetto, as the song slowly builds to a heavily rocking chaos of synths and guitars. Not a fantastic opener, but it really grabs your attention. <br /> <br />2. Starlight: <br />The follow-up, Starlight, starts with a massively distorted bass-line, and when the rest of the instruments and vocals kick in, it is clear that this is the first bonafide pop song by Muse. A potentially huge single, it's a lovely loveable love song.  <br /> <br />3. Supermassive Black Hole: <br />The advance-single everyone knows. This song really seems to have split the Muse fan masses in two: some love it, others hate it. I was a bit skeptical at first, but now I love it. It's a funky dance track with that Muse twist - really great way to explore new grounds! <br /> <br />4. Map of the Problematique: <br />A really dark track, featuring some very bleak lyrics (Matt's visions of the future?). The haunting melodies and the hard-hitting drums support each other very well. One of the best songs on the album.  <br /> <br />5. Soldier's Poem: <br />Muse really slow the engine down for the first and only time on this brief track. Once again, Muse have experimented with new sounds. Amidst all the crazy, rocking riff-o-rama of the record, this track is a mellow delight of gentle acoustic guitars, really beautiful vocal harmonies by Matt. Sounds almost like some waltzing pop hit from the 50's or 60's.  <br /> <br />6. Invincible: <br />An organ and marching drums begin the 6th track, titled 'Invincible'. The lyrics probably refer to a lover, while having political undertones (\\"Together we're invincible\\"). The track builds and builds and we even get a classic Matt guitar solo with the usual tapping and whammy-effects. Beautiful track! <br /> <br />7. Assassin: <br />The most hard-hitting and hard-rocking track of the album! Muse really pulls all the stops on 'Assassin', and especially drummer Dominic Howard impresses with some totally insane drumming, reaching almost metal-like intensity. A catchy chorus makes for another brilliant track.  <br /> <br />8. Exo-Politics: <br />A solid, mid-tempo rocking song, with lyrics dealing with conspiracy-theories involving aliens and government secrets. Really catchy chorus and another obvious single-choice.  <br /> <br />9. City of Delusion: <br />'City of Delusion' is the beginning of the album's last chapter, as it is linked with the last 2 songs through flamenco-like guitar instrumentations. This song has a really great vibe to it, with a lot of epic bombast including big string- and horn sections. Simply beautiful. <br /> <br />10. Hoodoo: <br />Opening with a lonely, reverb-laden guitar, this song initially sounds like the soundtrack of a Western B-movie. However, it builds into a piano-driven rock song, before finally settling with the lonely guitar and Matt's disillusioned lyrics of personal failure. Tragically romantic and a great way to build up to the crushing album-climax: Knights of Cydonia. <br /> <br />11. Knights of Cydonia: <br />So we're at the end of the album. But what an end this is! Starting off with an alien hover-like sound, laser beams, and horses galloping, you know that you're in for a special ride. In a wave of guitars, howling Matts and other great things, the beat comes crashing in, and drags you along. It sounds like a western-movie in space, with Muse being the musical soundtrack of the ride. Needless to say, this is a totally breathtaking track! At some point halfway during the song, it shifts sound and mood, and the last minutes are from then on dominated by heavy Muse-riffing and theatrical, almost Queen-like vocal harmonies. Once it is all over, you realize the album could not have ended in any better way. <br /> <br /> <br />As the track by track list indicates, I am very impressed by 'Black Holes & Revelations'. For all the nay-say'ers who blame Muse for being \\"Sellouts!\\", \\"Too poppy!\\", while they cry for Origin of Symmetry 2, I can only say: give Muse a break! It's only good and healthy that the band expand their sound instead of sticking to a tired formula, and this is possibly the best way they could ever achieve that progress. So get the album - my guess is that you won't find a better rock record in 2006. Oh, and if you get the chance - go see them live. Muse has rightfully been heralded as one of the best live acts in the world. Their live-shows are totally mind-blowing - an experience you'll remember for life!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I am always a fan of Martin Scorcese films, he manages to bring a new style to each and everyone he does, and \\"No Direction Home\\" is another instant hit. The movie focusses on Dylan's life itself, not just his music career. It shows a lot of interviews with different people who knew Bob Dylan or just knew his music. I was captivated with how the movie managed to just flow freely and was surprised when it ended because if seemed like it had only just begun. This is one film you should definately see. <br /> <br />The film focusses on Bob Dylan's childhood; from growing up in a town in Minnesota, and how he managed to start singing and playing music in small coffe houses and even festivals. What was great about this film is all the new footage that was aired in it. We see still photography shots of Dylan as a young man, playing with a guitar or his harmonica in front of a crowd of people. There is old footage of concerts, interviews, and press conferences that many people probably wouldn't have seen back then, or even now. <br />  <br />Interviews include people such as; Izzy Young, Paul Nelson, Al Kooper, Allen Ginsberg, and many others. But probably the greatest interviewee of them all is Bob Dylan himself. He talks about everything! Growing up, his first musical performance, he even talks about other great musical artists, my favorite of them being Johnny Cash. Some great footage in this film. <br /> <br />Extras include: <br /> <br />Bob Dylan Performances: <br /> <br />No Direction Home <br />Blowin' in the Wind <br />Mr. Tambourine Man <br />Man of Constant Sorrow <br />Girl of the North Country <br />Love Minus Zero/No Limit <br />One Too Many Mornings <br /> <br />Plus More! <br /> <br />This is one fantastic look at Bob Dylan. If you are any sort of fan of him or his music, watch this DVD and you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />Highly Recommended
0975991477|5.0|Excellent book <br />1 Well written and up to date material.
1416524800|3.0|Initially, I was taken in by the fast pace of the story, the out-of-the-ordinary characterizations, and the huge amount of information Brown has collected about geology, marine biology, weaponry and national security issues.  This is a scientific/political thriller that, at least for the majority of the book, does not talk down to its readers.  It has the typical Dan Brown structure:  short chapters that track several story lines at once, all of which are interrelated and eventually come together in what is supposed to be a wallop of a surprise ending.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as good as Brown is at creating a thick plot line, that's how bad he is at wrapping it all up in a believable way.  Tedium and disgust set in precisely at the moment I should have been most on the edge of my seat.  The surprise identity of \\"the controller\\" was strained, to say the least, and the manner in which our heroes escape from the clutches of their highly trained enemies was alternatively laughable and boring to read.  As in the very disappointing ending to The Da Vinci Code, Deception Point's climax suffers greatly from lack of imagination.  Brown struggles to keep his protagonists alive after he has created a set-up in which, by all rights, they should never be able to survive...but the form demands a \\"happy ending,\\" and this in itself dooms the book to predictability and cliche.<br /><br />During this last, painful portion of the book, Brown's awful writing comes into clear focus.  Sentences like \\"Rachel felt like she was moving through a nightmare\\" do nothing to enhance my understanding of what Rachel actual felt.  Brown could use some lessons in metaphor building, but what the heck, his books sell jillions of copies, and nobody seems to care about how cogent his metaphors are.<br /><br />Bottom line:  very entertaining until we get to the point where it all has to matter, and then very disappointing.  Hence, 3 stars.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|If you're old enough to have seen the \\"Carry On\\" movies the first time around, or have watched them on DVD on \\"oldies night\\", (don't worry, we're not going to ask your age) you'll see the resemblance to this funny take on the world's greatest lover.  Slapstick, double entendres and misunderstandings abound, as Heath Ledger tries to fill the trousers of the legendary lothario without getting a broken back in the process.<br /><br />It takes place in 1753 in Venice, a time when no woman is safe from the charms of Casanova, not even those confined to the convent.  Luckily for him he has friends in the right places and escapes being strung up for debauchery (a big word which in the movie means that he shakes a lot of bedsprings without the benefit of a marriage license)<br /><br />After going one conquest too far, his friend the Doge insists that Casanova get married ASAP, or face exile from Venice.  Exile is not a possibility, as we learn early in the movie that he has a very good reason for sticking around, so marriage it is, and the lady to whom he pledges his troth is not only a virgin, but extremely willing to be wed.  In a classic case of bad timing, he then meets the one woman worthy of his affection, and she turns out to be a cross-dressing (but only when necessary to prove a point) feminist writer who hates every bone in his body.  She unfortunately is betrothed to a corpulent but very wealthy lard merchant (Oliver Platt) whom she has never set eyes on before, the union having being arranged by her late father as an insurance policy for the family fortune.<br /><br />If you're still with me after all that, things get even more complicated when Jeremy Irons shows up as Inquisitor Pucci, out for the bewigged head of Casanova as a gift for the hangman's noose.<br /><br />The important thing is not to attempt to take this movie seriously as a period piece, or as a factual account of the life of Casanova.  It is a historically set spoof of the life and especially the times of Casanova and should be taken with a pinch of salt - or was that lard?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 10, 2006be taken with a pinch of salt - or was that lard?

B000BNX3B4|1.0|I enjoyed other romantic comedy films by Cusack but wow! Out of 100's of films I have watched over the years this one will stick out as THE worst. Problems I had: The characters are without any depth or realism. The dialogue was fast and full of punch-lines like you are watching a poorly written 'Friends' episode at high speed while on coke. It was torture I can't imagine the hollywood executives who typed this film up unless they were reading Cosmo and taking hits of peyote. The personalities and lifestyles that the characters inhabited had no roots in reality as I know it. The film didn't allow for any person to connect with a single thing in this film. I seriously thought I was watching aliens who just looked like human and were trying to imatate humans. If you found yourself connecting to the people in this film I want you to call me so I can bring you to the circus. Then we can get you many dates fo sure!
0307276902|4.0|I have no personal experience with addictions, but even if I had read the book before it was exposed as fiction, I would have figured it out almost immediately.    1.  Nobody is going to be put on an airplane with a gaping cheek wound.  It would have been sutured first.    2.  You can't vomit that many times a day, every day, for days or weeks or months on end, and stay alive.  You just can't.    3.  The drugs used in dental procedures have NO abuse potential.  Painkillers used in aftercare are another story and dentists know what to do in these situations.    4.  One would think a 23-year-old man, even one left impotent from rampant alcohol and drug use, would show a smidgen more interest in sex than this guy does.    5.  I just can't imagine any treatment center allowing a client to order gigantic catered dinners from outside and having them brought in.  What little I do know about them - it strains credulity.  Wouldn't that be the perfect method for smuggling in contraband of all types?    6.  He goes on and on about being an Alcoholic and a Drug Addict but doesn't describe how these substances made him feel.  That didn't make sense to me.    etc. etc. etc.    That said, the book is a real page turner and does have its moments.  The story about the rock star (a very thinly disguised Steven Tyler) who spoke at their Daily Lecture had me laughing out loud.  As for the gluttony shown by some, one of my friends who once worked in substance abuse treatment did tell me that eating disorders are very common in this population, especially among women.    How I first heard about this book is an unusual story.  I still get a newsletter from my old church, in a city I moved away from three years ago, and they have a book club where they discuss books with various themes of hope and/or spirituality.  This was one of them, and when I read this website - long before the book was exposed as fiction - I wondered what those blue-haired old ladies thought about...........this.  The woman who suggested it is no spring chicken herself.    I'm guessing that Mr. Frey did have issues with drugs and alcohol, and got into some legal scrapes, but not to the extent he describes here.    Yes, I did get this book from the library, and I fully intend to get \\"My Friend Leonard\\" from the same place.  Okay, \\"My (imaginary) Friend Leonard.\\"
B000E33W1C|5.0|John Cleese brought his Monty Python insanity and \\"Fawlty Towers\\" confusion to A FISH CALLED WANDA, a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it.<br /><br />What I really appreciate about the film is that comedy FINALLY got its due: Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his inspired portrayal of Otto, the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but can't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else.  Twenty years later, I still laugh out loud at his performance.<br /><br />I believe Michael Palin won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well--and he's hilarious as well!<br /><br />(I've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged: Peter Sellers should have won for DR. STRANGELOVE and Steve Martin should've been at least nominated for ALL OF ME and then nominated for Best Supporting Actor for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.)<br /><br />Everything about WANDA works, even the little winks such as the name of Cleese's character, Archibald Leech--which was Cary Grant's real name (Grant and Cleese both come from the same part of England).<br /><br />A FISH CALLED WANDA is a comedy worthy of serious study.<br /><br />No kidding.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Having only listened to Aenima, I found the 10,000 Days CD to be much more cohesive and coherent. I have heard a lot of diehard Tool fans say they are really disappointed in this CD, but for me I will listen to 10,000 Days more often than Aenima.
6305291446|5.0|This particular one ( H20) is the best of all the Halloween movies.  Jamie Lee is great in it.  Thanks, ShirleyAnn
B000000W6F|5.0|If you like Rock music and you only settle for the best, buy this album. There are so many reasons why this album is so brilliant. The guitar work is extremely magical and exquisite. On the contrary to the other Pumpkins albums, it's all real performing. By this I mean no drum machines or synthesizers are used. The LSD the Pumpkins were experimenting with at the time obviously acted as a source of inspiration. If your a fan of the Pumpkins other albums, there is no reason you wouldn't like this one{their debut}. All I am really trying to say is get your hands on this record and officially experience it. Crank it up real loud on a quality stereo, find a comfortable place to sit, and let your mind be soothed. If it turns out you hate this record, go see a doctor.
2266104535|5.0|Ce livre etait tres interessant.  On pense beaucoup au sujet apres avoir lu.  Je le recommende. <br /> <br />This book was thought provoking and a real page turner.  I highly recommend it.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|nothing works here.  the acting is poor, the attempts at creating atmosphere are hamstrung by the copious addition of cheese, its too scary for kids and too stupid for adults. I had to stop watching after 25 minutes it was so painful.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The only way I can start to give a sense of how great this movie is to say unequivocally, this is the only movie I have ever watched that has gotten funnier every time I see it.  There is a lot of great dialogue and acting in this film that you might not pick up on with the first viewing.  Just a funny, semi-ridiculous cast of characters that retain authenticity interacting.  We need more movies like this.
B00006AW2M|4.0|This is actually my favorite Stones record despite the funny cover and album title. This contains all good melodies. It's underrated and I don't know why. Aftermath and Forty Licks are two of my other favorites get those ones too.
B000002GFC|5.0|As several reviewers have mentioned, Cream wasone ofthe first major super groups.  The Members of the group: Jack Bruce on bass andvocals, Eric Clapton on guitar and vocals,and Ginger Baker on drums, had all been in other bands previously.  This cd, The Very Best ofCream, is a concise overview of Cream as a band.  It contains some of there most famous songs like \\"Crossroads\\" \\"White Room\\" \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\"  and \\"Strange Brew\\" along with some lesser known gems such as \\"Born on a Bad Sign.\\"This cd is packed with great songs, and if you're a fan of 60's rock,guitar rock, or blues rock,this group is for you.  I'm a teenager,and I think more of my generation should listen to this group.  In there day,they were one of the best super groups out there.
B0002W18MU|5.0|Johnny is a message of love and hope. It'd be impossible for anyone with a litle heart to not buy and love this cd. Mostly he speaks as a man facing his own death, it's amazing, really. In other songs he speaks like a wise man. He is a man the world misses not only those of his age.<br /><br />One of my favorite tracks on this record is \\"Rose of My Heart\\". \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\",\\" He called my name, \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" and \\"On the Evening Train\\" He is the one.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|The first Jimi Hendricks' cd I baught was \\"Are You Experienced?\\"  The second one I baught was one called \\"Smash Hits.\\"  Like \\"Smash Hits\\" this is a compilation cd of Jimi Hendrics' work.  In my opinion however, this is better than \\"Smash Hits.\\"  The main reason is that this cd has more variety.  Most of the songs on \\"Smash Hits\\" are from \\"Are You Experienced?\\"  All of the songs on this cd are great.  My personal favorite is \\"Voodoo Child (slight Return).\\"  The Woodstock version of the \\"Star-spangled Banner\\" is pretty cool as well.  If your new to Hendricks, this is a great cd to get.  The cd's great, and the songs are all great.  Jimi Hendricks was a great guitarist who died to soon, and the songs on this cd are a testament to his greatness.
076781326X|5.0|Dickens' story of Oliver Twist has always been popular and heart wrenching.  Well, unless you are just too too sophisticated for such things.  I find that being \\"above\\" such works just too deadly dull.  A small boy simply trying to survive in the world that is not only indifferent to him, but actively hostile to his trying to live, is  something people identify with and want to do something about.  And it was the desire to prick the conscience of the public to inspire action to care for the poor and orphans that Dickens was after.  David Lean made a fine film of the novel in 1948.  This musical was made twenty years later and won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1968.  There were many nominations including Ron Moody's wonderful portrayal of Fagin.  His is a very different Fagin from the character in the novel, but one that is always a delight on the screen and is indelible in the memory.<br /><br />And what Moody did for Fagin is pretty much what happens to the whole story.  Everything is cheered up quite a bit (for the most part) and cleaned up for a musical that sends everyone home singing some pleasant tunes.  The story follows the broad outlines of the novel.  Nancy (Shani Wallis) is freshened up and made more beautiful than such a creature could ever have been, but she still pays the price for protecting Oliver from Bill Sykes.  Oliver Reed's Bill Sikes is amazingly threatening and burns in the memory of children who see the movie, even today.<br /><br />The musical does have a sharp split in mood.  The first half of the movie, all the way to the song \\"Who Will Buy\\" is pretty much treated as a journey, but one of improving fortune for Oliver and culminates in that song.  The mood is jolly and full of tunes one can't help but remember.  You find yourself singing them for days afterwards even when you don't want to.  They are that infectious.  However, after that song, once Sikes decides he needs to get the boy back to protect himself, no matter what.  The story and the film change a great deal.  It is almost like falling off a cliff.<br /><br />The musical finds a happy ending for all except the one great villain and his beautiful victim.  However, the jolly mood of the first half returns with some more happy tunes and we leave the theater with the horror of Sikes and Nancy sort of tucked away behind our good mood.  As I watched this musical again, I was amazed how well things still hold up.  There is one song, though, that as an adult I found a bit unnerving.  When Nancy sings \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\", I thought about how too typical this self destructive attitude is and wish such an awful sentiment didn't get such a beautiful song.  She isn't staying by a cancer patient, you know.  She is pledging to a monster.  Still, it is a beautiful song.  I just hope it is more often sung in the context of a more noble situation.<br /><br />Oh, and for you younger viewers.  All those huge crowd scenes are actually full of people.  I know that today all those little folks in the back would all by CGI.  However, those did not exist in 1968.  Those are all people dancing way in the back.  Yeah, even the dots way way in the back are actual people dancing.  This musical was already a bit dated when it was done as far as style and being happy and cheerful without irony.  Such a movie was, I believe, never made again.  So, it is great that we have this multiple Oscar winning film to remember a time before everyone felt the need of being miserable as a fashion statement.  Strongly recommended for all audiences, except the too ironically detached.e a great deal.  It is almost like falling off a cliff.

B000FGGE68|2.0|Aeon Flux revisited. Yawn inducing plot...... It is so similar to aeon flux...heroine does mission but during mission the bad guys and good guys become unclear....blah.  Fight scenes consisted of her twirling and dancing around while hundreds of bullets sprayed around her, never hitting her.  She changed hair color for what reason? The annoying mute kid accompanied her through the movie, much like so many other annoying mute kids in movies (the new x-men, etc....) Not worth the time.
0977326403|4.0|This book is a rather pricey, 37-page paperback that attempts to apply the principles of Good to Great to non-profit (\\"Social Sector\\") organizations. This booklet is valuable and raises interesting questions. But the data are incomplete, as Collins readily acknowledges. Much is vague and general, as a result. The shift from an economics engine to a \\"resource engine\\" remains unclear and confusing. Also, he needs to look at the particular problems non-profits face, including a difficult environment, perhaps even one that no longer needs its services at all. More is needed, then, but the author is a first-rate investigator who will embrace this challenge and, I'm sure, give us a more fully fleshed-out study later.
0761944524|5.0|The author provides clear explanation of various statistic techniques; what each of them means, when to be applied, and how to use them in a very understandable way. This was what I was exactly looking for. Good examples with step by step guide with actual dialog boxes from the SPSS window are also very helpful. I really like it a lot. And the little jokes/comments in the book make it more fun to read. Best stat book I've bought ever! Thank you!!
B000EWBNMS|5.0|If you liked sixth Sense or Dead Zone you should enjoy medium. I <br />approached this series with caution initially because I did not want to <br />See the ghost of the week. However by the 2nd episode I was fully <br />Immersed in Medium's own style. It's a mixture of thriller, mystery, <br />Suspense, Hitchcock Sixth Sense and Dead Zone with a family that <br />Actually represents the way a real family is they argue, disagree, <br />Fight yet loves each other. There are no wasted moments in this series <br />And every episode was enjoyable. How many series can say that? Alison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) the star has psychic abilities by touching someone, dreaming, or being to close to something that that person has touched in some way. Alison has accepted that when this paranormal happens her job is to pursue the matter to resolution even if it affects her family life or personal beliefs. She cannot be contented till the matter is fully resolved
B000BTC5LW|5.0|...of all of the music/concert DVD's I own, and that numbers in the 100's. This is the mother of all rock concert videos. Production, in sound and visually, is off the charts. It grabs you by your privates and does not let go until the ending credits. David and the boys ( no Syd of course, no Roger either) have never sounded and played better. I saw this concert live in New Orleans and I would give that experience of a lifetime up to own this video if I had to make a choice. If you love PF, buy it NOW; if you like PF buy it now, if you think you like PF buy it now, and if you just like one or two PF songs.....buy it NOW !! Crank it up and let the 5.1 take over. View it alone the first time, it is a rock religious experience! All the eras and periods of the Floyd are represented. \\"Shine on you Crazy Diamond\\" as the opener will peel your scalp back. If it does not, then check your own \\"Pulse\\", you are dead.......!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I am passionate about music and have been saddened by music out there today thanks to American Idol type talent the corporations of the world seem to think we all crave.  Would our beloved bands such as Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Rush, etc. ever existed in this day and age?  Anyway, I adore this album and find it so refreshing to listen to and comforting to know that good music can still be found.  Love it!
0786860707|5.0|Speaking as someone who started animation awhile back and needed to learn from the best, I found this one book the most helpful.  I was turned onto the book from one of the actual Disney animators and we were able to discuss being in the business. It's what he, and most of the others that work there, consider the Bible of Animaton.  His words. The book itself is not for a quick read or a nightly read.  It's an education and industry guide for the world of movies.  As I'm working on any project, you can bet I reference this book a lot.<br /><br />The book is great for people like myself to read straight up, but I get a kick out of those that say it's dry and boring. The book itself is full of the best wisdoms of the founding fathers of animation.  The samples are great and it's full of great behind the scenes photos and stories.  I really enjoyed the character sketches and quick animations.  Definately not a book to miss if you are interested in getting into animation, both hand-drawn and computer.  It applies to both because it teaches you the fundamentals of animaton, the timing, the story, and the overall production.  It's a great foundation for anyone wanting to learn the craft.

0440418569|5.0|At the end of _The Subtle Knife_, Lyra was kidnapped by Mrs. Coulter, who we find at the beginning of _The Amber Spyglass_ has turned against the Church and fled to a remote mountain village where she is keeping her daughter in a drugged sleep in order to \\"protect\\" her. Will, accompanied by the angels Baruch and Balthamos, insists on rescuing Lyra before he will take the subtle knife to Lord Asriel. After a harrowing escape from Mrs. Coulter and now accompanied by Lord Asriel's tiny Gallevespian agents, the two determine to travel to the land of the dead to find Will's father and Lyra's friend Roger, which will test their courage and strength of will more than anything they have been through so far. Meanwhile, Mary Malone, the physicist and ex-nun who helped them in the previous book, finds herself in another alternate world, where evolution itself has taken a different turn and a conscious species called mulefa has developed.<br /><br />In the course of the book we will go with Lyra and Will to the world of the dead, at the entrance of which she will be forced to make the great betrayal foretold by the witches and others; witness the final battle between the forces of Lord Asriel and those of the Authority as well as Lyra's parents' final grand gesture on her behalf; and end up in a quiet field in the world of the mulefa as Lyra and Will make a momentous discovery that sets the history of Dust (and consciousness) on the right path again.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass contains many mature and disturbing themes that parents might want to discuss with their children, such as the nature of death, whether the Authority is really God Himself or only some people's warped, twisted idea of God, and the fact that sometimes we must give up what matters most to us in order to live a full life. Pullman doesn't pull any punches or shoehorn his story into a conventional \\"happy ending,\\" and of course it's hard to imagine any of the greatest romances becoming an everyday life together with screaming kids and arguments about the car. The main ideas that this series communicates to me are: 1) True stories are \\"nourishing,\\" as No-name the harpy puts it, \\"true\\" meaning much more than merely factual; 2) Keeping promises and keeping faith with individuals is more important than \\"saving the world\\" -  in fact, it may _be_ what saves the world. 3) We must live in the here and now, whether or not we believe, as Pullman does, that there isn't anywhere else. (In Judaism we are told that we will have to account to God after our deaths for the things we didn't enjoy during our lives.)<br /><br />A major theme of this particular book seems to be cooperation, as time and time again people who start a relationship in mutual distrust come to respect each other and work together for a common good. The society of the mulefa has been accused by some of being like a hippie commune. However, in addition to being a different species which may not have some of the violent impulses that seem to be part of human nature, it could be argued that the fact that they only have one prehensile appendage, a trunk, instead of two hands, and thus need to cooperate in order to do many of the things that we can do alone may have caused nature to select for tolerance and the ability to get along.<br /><br />I feel that this entire series would be perfect for teenagers who are wrestling with their own doubts about the role of religion in their lives, although it should be pointed out to them that Pullman's almost uniformly negative Church is a fictional one and that most of the best qualities that his characters possess are also valued by most or all religions in their truest forms.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|How many shows out there are really about something? Seriously, how many have and excellent cast and script and can deliver every week. Without falling into a slump, Everwood remained fresh and new. It was always interesting and always relevent. I appreciated the range of actors, even having Irv and Edna, two characters in the senior citizen age group, playing key and pivital roles. This show was a true gem, a diamond in the rough, if you will. I signed petitions and even e-mailed the new CW president, Dawn Ostroff, but it was to no avail. I really hope the station knows what it missed out on. I've seen letter after letter in the newspapers and other publications asking why this show was cancelled. I don't understand, it seems as if the show had supporters, so why flush this gem for the resurrection of the horrid, past it's experation date, 7th Heaven? I guess I'll never understand how good television gets left in the dust while smut, trash, and sheer idiocy continues to reign.  <br /> <br />Anyway my point is simply this, Everwood was awesome. If anybody is paying attention, please give its fans some belated satisfaction by supplying the 2nd-4th seasons on DVD. I think that we at least are owed that. To all the Everwood lovers, I feel your pain, and definitely understand your anger. To all those who never watched Everwood, pick up the first season. Get acquainted with a show whose time was severely cut short.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|A truly original and moving film, with the combined talents of Australian director Peter Weir (Master and Commander, Witness) and Andrew Nicole, (Lord of War, Gattacca, Simone) with his exceptional writing ability, The Truman Show hit the theatres across the board with dazzling critical acclaim not seen in the industry for many years.<br /><br />Andrew Nicole is an exceptionally gifted writer. New Zealand born, trained in London, making commercials, he travelled to Hollywood submitting his Truman script. Evidently the film execs told him that Truman was at least an $80 million project and they could not and would not attempt to sell a first-time screenplay to the studio. He went back to his little apartment and penned, Gattacca, a story about a future dystopian world based on the potential horrors of a society organized by way of genetics'...for less than $40 million. He directed Gattacca that ended up making more money than anyone, including the studio execs, ever dreamt.<br /><br />Consequently, The Truman show got the green light, however, again, the studio could not invest their dollars into a one-time director and screenplay writer, Nicole. Peter Weir finally, after hours and days of deliberation, got the job and pre-production began in earnest.<br /><br />Jim Carey at that point in time had only played over the top comedic roles. A real genius in many respects, he jumped whole heatedly into the character of Truman, revealing his range of talent as an actor. The character, Truman, represents everyman, an individual evolving as a \\"product\\" of his environment, the media and the sheer power of advertising.<br /><br />Since Truman's conception he has been the focus of millions of television viewers. For over thirty years, the TV viewing public has seen Truman move through his life. This \\"Reality\\" show had become a multi-billion dollar industry, as advertisers clamoured to be seen, until Truman's perfectly constructed world begins to deconstruct and everything falls apart.<br /><br />Everything about this film is astounding: cinematography, creating camera angles never seen before in conventional film. The sets, Seahaven, could be any town across the world. A beautiful soundtrack from Phillip Glass and Truman's perfect wife, Meryl, (Laura Linney) a quasi \\"Stepford\\" wife from the fifties. Truman's best friend, Marlon, (Noah Emmerich) was outstanding as Truman's childhood friend. The entire cast and crew contributed to this wholly remarkable story about our modern world.<br /><br />The most interesting character has to be Christof, (Ed Harris) the man responsible for the `The Truman Show', an egotist, a self-realized god-like individual who would rather see his \\"creation\\" live in his artifice than the \\"real' world. Harris won many awards for this role that were all well deserved.<br /><br />This film will be discovered and re-discovered for years to come. Why? Because the film stepped over the boundaries of the mainstream, took a risk, travelled beyond the construct, and has managed to teach us something.<br /><br />The Truman Show is truly one of the great films of our time.his film is astounding: cinematography, creating camera angles never seen before in conventional film.

0525948023|5.0|If you are a fan of Tolle's, this book will delight you.  It gives a clear, concise, summary of the major points he had made in other books but elaborated upon insightfully for practical application in one's life.  This is a book that I plan to re-read many times (I'm a slow learner, it seems), and I've already garnered a number of insights that have given me the courage to trust Life and let It carry to into further embrace of the Presence.  I hope the audio CDs will be quickly available for my use on my daily walks, since of all the Tolle audios (lectures and book readings) that I have so far, I put the highest confidence in this one as providing a continuing powerful emotional boost and reminder (of what I and all of us already know but need constant reminding of).   <br />   I found the title (A New Earth) a tad misleading, since it is only in the last chapter (called \\"A New Earth\\") that the topic of the collective awakening (and global social, environmental, political transformation) is mentioned at all and then only briefly--but this suits me fine.  Tolle basically believes that world transformation (an awakened New Earth) can only come into existence through individual awakening (\\"awakened doing\\"); all other action is ego-driven and will not bring us what we yearn for. This book has already helped me greatly in furthering my understanding that all \\"troubles\\" (my fears and addictions) are the result of ego identification and can be dropped with conscious awareness.  If you relate to Tolle's previous work, you will surely love this book as the best yet.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've had this album for years and years, yet everytime I listen to it, I hear new layers or sounds. THe entire album has a unique texture and sets a mood in a way that few other albums possibly could. Every track is a masterpiece, yet collectively, the album is even more brilliant than each individual track alone. In all of music, there is really no other album quite like this. The songwriting abilities of Thom Yorke and co. have greatly matured, though the previous album the Bends is also a remarkable and (in my opinion)timeless album, as well.  <br />THough it's hard to point out highlights when dealing with such an incredible work of art, I will attempt to: Airbag- that sweet, distorted guitar churning through a relatively soft song; Paranoid Android- incredible lyrics, some of the most creative guitar riffing and soloing, reminiscent of Happiness is a Warm Gun by Beatles, as it is essentially combined songs. Subterranean etc- lyrics and atmospheric slide guitar is great follow up to Android; Exit Movie For a Film- the timeless \\"We Hop that you choke,\\" this song is among the bands finest ever recorded; Let Down-almost poppy with its riffing, more electronics working their way into album, lyrics are superb; Karma Police is indescribable, possibly the bands finest song, and arguably the finest recorded in the 90s; Electioneering is hard-rocking and intense, as w/ most of the songs, the lyrics are very meaningful, but not overly obvious in this meaning; Climbing up the Walls- one of the eeriest songs i've ever heard, the lyrics are haunting, the dynamics are sublimely placed for maximum effect, and Yorke sounds like he's on the verge of madness; No Surprises- soft, eerily so in comparison to the previous two tracks, the distortion is all gone, it's like the aftermath of a storm. One of the most affecting songs ever recorded by the band, the lyrics, music, vocals and it's position after CLimbing UP the Walls give it an indescribable impact. Lucky-is a bittersweet masterpiece. The final track is haunting, desperate and ideal as a closer. <br /> <br />From the opening riff of Airbag, to the solo on Paranoid Android, the otherwordliness of Subterranean etc., the haunting subduedness followed by the climactic lyrics/vocals on Exit Music, the catchiness yet sadness of Let Down, the piano and guitar building from softness to the ending distorted noise and powerful vocals singing \\"I lost myself\\" in Karma Police, the inhumanity of the robot voice on Fitter, Happier, the pounding guitars, drums, bass, and vocals of Electioneering, the creepiness of Climbing up the Walls, the defeatedness of No Surprises with it's highe pitched arpeggios, the bitterness of Lucky and the surrealness of the last track, this album is filled with great moments like the best of movies, yet only better... much better.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|On her fisrt CD, Music From The Sun, I like a grand total or 2 songs.  Let Me and LaLaLa are the only good songs.  On her second CD, A Girl Like Me, I like a grand total of 8 songs.  thats 400% more.  SOS is infectious, Unfaithful is emotional, We Ride is a slow pary jam, Break It Off is a Fast Party Jam, also the remix of If It's Loven That You Want is much better than the original version.  Not that this CD is perfect, Dem Haters, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and Selfish Girl all have the exact same beat.  Plus there are a few too many balleds.  But a good CD nontheless
B000000H4A|3.0|If you are reading this, you probably know that after \\"Mercyful's Fate's\\" 'Don't Break the Oath,' the group broke up. (Largely due to the praises to hell on the afore mentioned record.) Guitarist Hank Shermann and drummer Kim Ruzz went their own way, and Bassist Tim Hansen and guitarist Mike Denner stayed with the front man King Diamond. Drummer Mick Dee and the highly underrated guitarist Andy LaRoque joined the party, and this was the beginning of the group we now call \\"King Diamond.\\" While later efforts by \\"King Diamond\\" reflect stronger writing and musical skills, this 1st record hints at the greatness that was to come in later efforts such as \\"Abigail,\\" \\"Them,\\" and \\"Conspiracy.\\" On this 1st record, we are offered a half length story and a few individual songs. After an impressive keyboard opening, we hear the story of a woman who was so obsessed with her daughter Molly that she kept her locked away from anyone else and decided to make her immortal with a portrait. The girl dies, but as most of you know, when King Diamond is involved, death is but a temporary absence. While one can tell this is an early record, the musical and lyrical qualities are prevalent. After the story of the record takes a break, 'Charon' keeps the tone. 'Lurking In the Dark' starts with some howls and is a decent song. 'Halloween' is a good spooky song that keeps the tone and musical pace of the record going. 'Voice From the Past' is a good guitar instrumental played by none other than Mr. Diamond himself. 'Haunted' goes back to the story of Molly and offers a crowning end to the record. While this group was to improve with age, \\"Fatal Portrait\\" remains a good record and prepares us for the horrors awaiting in \\"Abigail,\\" \\"Them,\\" \\"Conspiracy,\\" \\"The Spider's Lullabye,\\" and \\"The Graveyard.\\"
B000002LJW|3.0|Refusing to be relegated into classic rock history, Clapton comes out with a very modern, revamped sound. The result is Journeyman, and, for the most part, it does not dissapoint. There is a lot to suggest that Clapton has matured not only as a player but as a songwriter as well. There are songs of betrayal and loss in a kind of middle aged sensibility. And the playing on here is very polished and professional. This also happens to be the drawback of this album. Most of Clapton's solo work has been slightly underproduced and understated, lending itself to a soulful approach. The standout songs here are Pretending, Old Love and Bad Love. Given his career, there are much better albums, but this one will do for the casual fan, with a limited range of  Clapton knowledge.
B000000H48|5.0|King Diamond may not get the kudos that Metallica, Megadeth, or Slayer often get. But if you compare King Diamond's \\"Conspiracy\\" to Metallica's best (\\"Ride the Lightening\\"), Megadeth's best (\\"Rust In Peace\\"), or what I consider Slayer's best (be it \\"Hell Awaits\\" or \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\"), it is clear that King Diamond is the better musician. (1) While Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer have their abilities, they often tend to hide behind the noise. If King Diamond played the songs on \\"Conspiracy\\" on a classical guitar and a piano, THE SONGS WOULD STILL SOUND GOOD. He uses speed and intensity, but he's not hiding behind it. He DOES HAVE impressive knowledge of musical composition. (2) Unlike Metallica, Slayer, or Megadeth, King Diamond DOES KNOW that a keyboard is a crucial element. Even Bon Jovi (whose records people normally buy for the vocals moreso than the music) knows that a keyboard is crucial! Onto the subject at hand. For those of you who don't know this, \\"Conspiracy\\" follows the events of \\"Them\\" and raises the horror to a frightening level (even for King Diamond's records). With the frightening and intense 'At the Graves,' King meets his sister (who was killed in \\"Them\\") and makes plans for her to visit more often. 'Sleepless Nights' turns the music down a notch, but the lyrics are so frightening, and the quiter tone emphasizes that. 'Lies' reintroduces us to Dr. Landau from \\"Them,\\" and the guitar work is almost hypnotic. 'Visit From the Dead' shows that guitarist Andy LaRoque has classical abilities as Missy makes another appearance and warns King of the danger to come. 'The Wedding Dream' begins with a creepy keyboard movement. We've all heard wedding marches, but this one seems to sound more frightening than sacramental. King learns that his mother and the doctor are planning to marry. 'Amon Belongs To Them' has a slower but still haunting tone as King's fate begins. 'Something Weird' is a well done and creepy instrumental. In 'Victimized,' King's enemies decide his fate, and the musical levels as well as King's famous vocals resume a full blast level. 'Let It Be Done' is creepy dialogue with some subtle and eerie keyboard touches. 'Cremation' is the final track on this horror filled masterpiece and King seems to know that in this case, what he doesn't say is more frightening than what he might say. And just when you think the record is over, King speaks once more to make sure he leaves us in a state of horror. While we might argue that \\"Abigail II\\" was not crucial to \\"Abigail,\\" it is virtually indisputable that \\"Conspiracy\\" was a vital sequel to \\"Them.\\" I'll conclude by saying that if you are not familiar with King Diamond's records, you may do best in the case of \\"Conspiracy\\" to read the lyrics in daylight before you listen to the record.decide his fate, and the musical levels as well as King's famous vocals resume a full blast level.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Over recent years, Dreamworks have produced a string of films aimed to entertain young children. However with the exception of \\"Shrek,\\" to the older audience, their films are somewhat lame and bland. But after watching \\"Madagascar,\\" for which I had low expectations, even I had to admit that Dreamworks did a mighty good job. I sat down with my younger sister (who I'll add ADORES this film) and I chuckled and smiled my way through this surprisingly charming Dreamworks success. <br /> <br />Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is an ambitious zebra who has spent the past decade cramped in Central Park's New York City zoo. Unlike his best friend Alex, who, ironically, is a lion (Ben Stiller), Marty dreams to live in the wide open spaces of \\"the wild.\\" In the film's introduction we also meet Melmen, a giraffe who is a hyperchondriac (\\"Friends\\"' David Schwimmer) and Gloria, a self-assured hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett Smith). In an amusing twist of events, the four friends manage to escape the confinds of the zoo. To Marty's delight and Alex's sheer horror, they consequently land themselves on ship to a game reserve in Africa. In ANOTHER twist of events, they then become stranded on the island of Madagascar. The film then takes an interesting turn when Alex's carivorous instinct soon threatens his friendship with Marty, thus encouraging Marty to make the ultimate decision between his dream and his friendship. <br /> <br />I actually thought the storyline of \\"Madagascar,\\" was quite well-shaped and original. All animals, even those demosticated always carry with them those instincts and abilities that help them survive in the unforgiving wilderness. I want to really commend the film for their interesting exploration of this concept.  <br /> <br />The film's story is accentuated and brightened by its child-friendly, yet pleasant humor. Stiller, Rock and Schwimmer are all renowned for their experience in comedy, which is evident through many of the film's amusing scenes. However, I didn't feel that the characters of Melmen and Gloria were given enough limelight. The film focussed a little too much on Alex and Marty's characters, and didn't explore the other two nearly as much. David Schwimmer's Melmen, I think, was the funniest character of the four, and so it would have been great if the audience saw more of him. <br /> <br />Unlike Pixar films, which are aimed to appeal across the ages, \\"Madagascar\\" is predominantly aimed at younger children, so naturally the gags were somewhat repetative. But this is hardly a bad thing. As I mentioned before, my nine-year-old sister simply loves this film, and she was in barrels of laughter throughout. For older viewers, although not to the same extent, there is certainly a charm that I found endearing. <br /> <br />Another aspect I must comment on is the film's abundant colour. I personally, am more of a Disney animation fan, however I am at awe at the vibrance and brightness of computer-animation, making it wholly appealling to its target audience of young children. <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"Madagascar,\\" is not quite \\"Finding Nemo,\\" but I really did enjoy and chuckle my way through. With a surprisingly interesting and original story accompanied nicely with the comedic flair of its lovable characters, \\"Madagascar\\" is a film that with have the young ones laughing outloud and the older ones enjoying the colourful ride.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|Well I must say I have truly been deprived from ms. corinne bailey rae.  I am new to her discovery, however I am astonished because of her amazing phrasing and rhythmic appeal.  She is a familiar yet fresh and jazz, blues,and soul artist with her own definition.  To say the least she is under-rated and amazingly radiant.

B000002B2X|4.0|This four track EP (five including the bonus track) features Alice In Chains playing some acoustic tracks. However odd it may sound, I find this style very suitable for Alice In Chains . All four songs are very well performed and presented. Layne Staley's voice shines especially on songs like `Am I Inside' where it gives you this claustrophobic feeling of isolation which is the whole idea of the song. Also worth mentioning is the vocal contribution of Chris Cornell from Soundgarden on the song `Right Turn'. His duet with Staley is one of the highlights of this album. So if you' re a fan of Alice in Chains or acoustic rock in the vein of Days of the New ,pick this up. It's certainly worth it. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you can find the double EP with Jar of flies.

B00000272N|4.0|\\"Facelift\\" was the debut of Seattle's Alice In Chains, in a period when grunge and Nirvana were constantly at the top of the charts. While no band (with Queensryche and Nevermore being the exception) could stay away from the so called Seattle sound, Alice In Chains seemed to have a distinctive sound and a personal identity. Fronted by the charismatic guitarist Jerry Cantrel, Alice In Chains had the ability to switch from melancholic pieces like \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" and \\"Bleed the Freak\\" to groovy rockers like \\"We Die Young\\", with ease, never losing any of their distinctive elements. The album begins really strong with heavy hitters \\"We Die Young\\" and \\"Man in the Box\\" and is followed by the ballads that mentioned before. The album continues to be particularly pleasant and enjoyable until a few songs before the end were it waters down and loses interest. It seems they got bored before ending the album and that resolved to some weak songs. The last track \\"Real Thing\\" is not bad though, and is a nice closer, at least. The album following \\"Facelift\\", \\"Dirt\\" was meant to be the band's best moment which set them really high at the time. This album though is perhaps their most original work and is definitely worth a listen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, I bought this because it had the joss whedon touch, I saw the series two or three episodes but I lost the interest because I didn't get the story but If you watch it in its original order, you'll get the mithology right at once! I relly recommend it!
B000024KBA|5.0|It's just been announced that Syd has died from diabetes at age 60, so I thought I would write something about him and this seemed a good place to do it. <br /> <br />There's a handful of people you could rightfully say were catalysts or instigators of epochal periods in human artistic development; one such period is what we like to call \\"The Sixties\\" and one such individual is Syd Barrett, the man who gave birth to Pink Floyd and helped to invent and define psychedelic music. <br /> <br />This record and the follow-up (\\"Barrett,\\" with Syd's crazy drawings of bugs on the cover) are essential documents, not just for the inspired and demented songs but also for the somewhat overlooked idea that they helped to set the standard for the \\"confessional\\" songwriting of the 1970s.  The nakedness of Syd's schizophrenia and declining mental state and their role in the performances here provide an unflinching, rare glimpse into real madness, warts and all.   In a weird but highly effective way Syd's records paved the way for songwriters from Roky Erickson to Daniel Johnston to make their fragile psychological conditions reflect in their material, opening up some truly, well, crazy possibilities.   <br /> <br />Syd's influence on music after 1967 is inestimable and unquantifiable... in his own way he was an avatar and you should get familiar with Pink Floyd's \\"Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\" and his own solo albums if you aren't already. <br /> <br />Today is a day to mourn the loss of a unique genius and to thank him for his contributions to the continuum.  He is definitely one of those people (like Jimi Hendrix, Gram Parsons, Sam Cooke, and others) without whom things would have been substantially different and probably not as much fun. <br /> <br />
0393035158|3.0|I've rarely looked forward to reading a book as much as this one.<br /><br />  The initial chapters didn't disappoint.  Harris' critique of religion and it's effects on society in the first few chapters was clear, engaging and convincing.  But as the book wound on, it began to lose its crisp focus, and it's analysis of how secular ethics could be used to form a basis for our actions was particularly tortured and unconvincing.  Equally disappointing were his brief, cavalier treatments of eastern religions, mediation, and consciousness which would have been better left until Mr. Harris either had more time or more to say on the subjects.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?  The first few chapters rate a clear 'yes', and I only wish that the second half were nearly as good.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|THe animation in FF7 Advent Children is simply gorgeous. It is the best I have ever seen point blank. It starts where the game stopped, and the dvd even has an extra feature to refresh those who havent played the game in awhile or not at all, so everyone can enjoy it. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends. The story focuses way too much on Cloud and Tifa's relationship and the other characters we came to love get the back burner and appear as cameos for a big battle, and that's it. Plus, for a truly good companion movie to the epic game, it really needed to be about two or three hours longer than it was. The whole thing felt rushed, and leaves the viewer wishing for more. Save your money and rent this one before you go out and buy it, it was a nice try but it is just lacking in too many ways. The only reason I give it three stars is because I loved the game so much.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|\\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" is no \\"Absolution\\", but it's a pretty great album nonetheless, and it should finally shake off those pesky Radiohead comparisons.  Here's how I'd break down the songs: <br /> <br />1) Take a Bow:  A really weak opener drenched in political sentiment (which would be ok, if the lyrics had any wit or cleverness attached to them).  4/10 <br /> <br />2) Starlight:  Luckily the album gets better.  Starlight is a very strong track (a love song!) that sounds a bit like mid-80's U2.  Solid lyrics, nice chorus, really sets the overall \\"electronic\\" feel of BH&R (synth bass pervades this album).  9/10 <br /> <br />3) Supermassive Black Hole:  Love it or hate it, the 1st single's an instant classic.  Falsetto-laced funk that will stick in your brain like taffy.  The rest of the album sounds nothing like this song (except for the bass/drums on occasion).  I almost feel guilty giving it a ... 10/10 <br /> <br />4) Map of the Problematique:  Another track that reminds me of U2.  An entertaining electronic-sounding song, similar in feel to Starlight.  Evoking loneliness and desolation, this is a really nice track lyrically, but the song kind of meanders in one place.  8.5/10 <br /> <br />5) Soldier's Poem <br />6) Invincible <br /> <br />Pretty average songs overall (the first a quiet piano-driven number, the second just drags on too long), but not bad; Muse has done better, similar songs on previous albums.  6/10 <br /> <br />7) Assassin:  This song ROCKS.  Awesome intro, phenomenal drumming, fantastic use of time signatures (verses have 18 beats instead of 16), great harmony in the chorus, *interesting* subversive lyrics (as opposed to those in \\"Take a Bow\\".  This is BH&R's \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\".  Exactly the sort of song that would play well in the US as a single.  10/10 <br /> <br />8) Exo-Politics:  A strong mid-tempo rocker, again reminding me a bit of U2.  I'd like this song a lot more if the lyrics weren't so silly (it's about conspiracies, zetasfilling the skies, satellites crunching on our minds, blah blah), but some monster riffs and super catchy chorus (although, pet peeve, sounds exactly like \\"Citizen Erased\\" off OoS) make this a solid song.  8/10 <br /> <br />9) City of Delusion:  My favorite song on the whole album.  Influenced by flamenco music, and sounding like something Ennio Morricone would write, this is just a CLASSIC Muse song.  Every time the verses come in, the instrumentation changes.  The chorus  is just phenomenal.  And it's got a trumpet solo!!  What's not to love?  10/10 <br /> <br />10) Hoodoo:  A quiet song, again with a Spanish folk / Western feel to it.  Not bad, sets a nice pace before rolling into the big finale.  7/10 <br /> <br />11) Knights of Cydonia:  Like City of Delusion, this one (the 2nd single) is classic Muse, and takes you on a real ride from an army of horses charging into battle, to surf music runs, to what sounds like computer game music for some sci-fi game, to Queen-like a cappella, to, in the end, a great rock climax.  9/10 <br /> <br />While lacking the unity of theme that made 2003's \\"Absolution\\" really great, BH&R is still a very solid album (despite a couple of weak songs).  I give it 4.5/5 overall (5 to combat the Muse haters out there).
B00013RC9I|5.0|Well I like it BETTER than Moof Safari.
B0007OCG56|5.0|Everyone in this movie gives an amazingly moving performance.  Not only is it Adam Sandler's best performance(because he is not trying to be a fool!), but also Tea Leoni's.  She shows herself to be a fine comedic actress with amazingly perfect timing.  Also remarkable is Paz Vega, especially when you consider that she learned English in the movie along with the character she plays(life imitating art!).  Even the children were perfectly convivncing.  I hope you get a chance to see the deleted scenes, many of which should have been left in!  Some of them are very funny, and some very touching.  A simple way to state the lesson that this story eloquently expresses, is the difficulty people in families have in communicating with each other, whether they speak the same language or not.  This is an excellent example of how it is possible for a perfect movie to come out of the great Hollywood machine!  All fans of the independent style film will love this movie and it is a great family film, as well.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Stephen Merritt is not in love, except with love itself.  And that shows in the melancholy, drenched, sad, glorious, 69 songs here, each of which touches upon some aspect of love.  I bet that for any state of love, you'll find one song on this album that resonates with you, ten that challenge you, and fifty-eight that bode what happens next.
0385336691|4.0|This is the tenth Jack Reacher thriller/mystery.  At about book six, it seemed that Mr. Child had fallen into a redundant pattern of Reacher out-thinking, out-shooting, out-fighting all the bad guys.  They were fun and entertaining, but formulaic. <br /> <br />Hard Way continues the diversity in plot that Mr. Child has exhibited in the last few books.  The diversity certainly adds to the series.  No longer are the books predictable. <br /> <br />In Hard Way, Reacher is solving a kidnapping of the wife of the leader a mercenary group.  Throughout the vast majority of the book, Jack Reacher is a sleuth rather than the superman fighter he was in the early books.  Of course, in the end he shows his  combat prowess, but by the time it comes, it is suitable and by no means gratuitous. <br /> <br />Child produces great characters in addition to Reacher, who continues to evolve and develope in every book.  The cast in this book, which includes (of course) a babe ally in the investigation, retired special forces men turned mercenary and others who went civilian.  They all are believable and not one a cut-out character.  All have depth. <br /> <br />This is more a mystery than a thriller and the mystery is a good one.  One of the finer subtle points is that Reacher is never quite a sleuth as he thinks, resulting in miscalculations which, in turn, result in nice plot twists and turns. <br /> <br />Mr. Child keeps getter better as his plots diversify and deepen.  This is a fine stand alone book, but it is enhanced by having read the prior Reacher books.  They make the main character more understandable.  If you read this first, I assure you that you will want to go back and read all the rest.  All of the books, this one included, are page-turners that keep the reader rapt.
0300108834|4.0|'A Little History of the World' is exactly what the title indicates. Gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century. Gombrich covers cave men, great religious leaders, philosophers, and events over an incredible timeline. <br /> <br />I got this book for my eight year old son and I to read together. There were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention. Other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events. In particular, the chapters covering the Inquisition and the causes that lead to the French Revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand. <br /> <br />This book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in. It may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Please note that the original version of these films are NON ANAMORPHIC.  This means that they are using old transfers of the films which will be only slightly better (if that) than our VHS copies which we all bought when they were marketed as \\"available for the last time.\\"  Well, that proved to be a lie, and I am sure we will some day get a nice anamorphic High Definition transfer of the original versions.  I wonder if everyone who bought the VHS versions that were advertised as being the last chance to get the original versions could file a class action lawsuit against Lucas??
B000000W5B|4.0|GHS was the last recording the Stones made with Jimmy Miller, who had produced 4 previous Stones classics in a row. This one is posssibly the weakest under his stewardship, in that there's less consistency in the songs. 'The opener 'Dancing with Mr. D' is pretty good and features the Stones in a sleazy mood, with a solid guitar riff underpinning the whole song. Jagger's vocals lends a real menacing air to the whole track.<br /><br />Other highlights are 'Coming down again', an excellent ballad with Keith doing the vocals in a genuine melancholy fashion. 'Angie' the single taken from GHS is one of the Stones most famous ballads, and hasn't diminished over time at all. 'Winter is another fine Stones ballad, and Mick Taylor plays some excellent lead guitar here, and indeed his guitar work is well represented throughout the whole album.<br /><br />The other rockers 'Silver Train', 'Doo, doo, doo..' and '100 years ago' were more mediocre by the Stones past standards. But there is one other notable rocker other than the opener, and that is the closer, 'Star, star'. That number provides a rousing finale, using a typical Stones 'Chuck Berry' riff, and at the time of its release (1973) its lyrics caused the album to attract a certain amount of controversy, so nothing new there regarding the Stones.<br /><br />There is one other strange ballad, 'Can you hear the music'. It has a rather haunting sound to it, and although it's repetitive that tended to emphasise the point that the Stones were questioning whether this might be their last 'good' album. That seemed to prove the case with future releases which showed the Stones in gradual, yet definite musical decline (IMO).<br /><br />So if you are not a Stones fan generally, listen to this a few times first before making your mind up, as many of the tracks, especially the ballads grow on you.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Both camps have valid points.  I personally will be picking up these versions too because they're the versions that I prefer, and I think it's important to have them for posterity.   <br /> <br />I think it was wrong of Uncle George to over-tinker with his films like that.  I have no problem with improving on picture and sound, or even restoring deleted scenes for a Special Edition cut.  But don't change plot details of your film just because you don't like them now twenty years after the fact.  You don't add blush to the Mona Lisa.  Leave it alone.  He better not touch one frame of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or I'm burning Skywalker Ranch to the ground.  At least when Steven Spielberg changed shotguns to walkie-talkies for the re-release of E.T., he gave consumers the choice and released both versions on DVD. <br /> <br />Anyway, gripes aside, I'm giving this release three stars for the original films, but only three for choosing to release them from non-anamorphic laser disc transfers with straight Dolby Sound.  Bad form indeed.
B000FILW86|2.0|I have been a Cheap Trick fan since I was a little kid.  I really looked forward to this album coming out.  I was sorely disappointed.  It's just odd and I don't think there's one redeeming song on it.  Don't waste your money.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Five stars for the concert, but... <br /> <br />...on the day that this DVD has been released, the news has come that Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett has died at the age of 60. <br /> <br />Shine on, Syd.
B000FVBLEI|4.0|Ok, If you aren't already a fan All That Remains, now is the time to get with the program. This CD has it all; agression, excellent song writing, top tier production and most of all....actual due dillegence  by the band in creating a CD worth purchasing.  <br /> <br />Unlike a lot of stuff out there nowadays where you can tell a band either didn't take the time to create a quality product (taking into account all the elements I mention above) or just plain tried to hard, All That Remains really came through on this one.  <br /> <br />For some time, this CD is going to be \\"all that remains\\" in my CD player.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but I have to say I love this refreshing songbird & just about every song on this CD. My favs are \\"trouble sleeping\\", the title track and \\"call me when you get this\\", I don't skip any songs, and I'm wicked with the repeat button. They're soulful, joyous...simply euphoric. I can't get enough!!!  If you're looking for the perfect chill music, this is it!!!  I just had to share my thoughts on this one!!!  It's so rare and exciting to me to find someone new who touches me musically the way this newcomer has.
B00000JBFW|5.0|It was during the hype of this reunion album that I got into Deep Purple. I watched the video for Perfect Strangers and I knew I just had to hear that song and have it permanently embedded in my brain. From the mountain-shattering organ at the beginning to the thundering classical structure at the end this song is heavy and haunting with Gillan singing like no one else could. I love his vocals on the title track and decided I had to find whatever I could with him singing.  <br /> <br />Looking back, I feel Gillan's voice tends to get a little whiny sounding at times and because of that I cannot get as thrilled about Wasted Sunsets as some other reviewers. But the aspects of his voice that I love are on the title track and most other songs on the album. I especially love the deep scream after the solo on Under the Gun, something he did well on Black Sabbath's Born Again. For the most part, the album introduces the 1980s generation of hard rock and metal fans to the monsterous sound of Deep Purple, combining both the thunder of the past and a new modern sound for 1984. When other bands were busy playing with synthesizers, Deep Purple brought back the hammond organ. Sadly, the following album explored a more commercial sound that didn't have the same grab-you-by-the-balls-and-throw-you-through-a-brick-wall kind of feel to it. This album stands alone in rock history. Treasure it for all it's worth.
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan incorporates an explicit and descriptive style of writing that is characteristic of his novels.  His language is rich and lush, and he utilizes his mastery of the English language to its fullest extent; the vocabulary is evocative, effective and sometimes menacing in describing every intricately framed detail.  <br /> <br />The story unfolds rather lazily, the plot moving through the viewpoints of the different characters. This gives the reader a chance to explore the personalities of the different characters. This languid style of writing also creates a connection with the initial setting of the book- a sultry and sluggish summer day in the year 1935. The protagonist of the book is a thirteen year old named Briony Tallis, who is in the midst of writing a play to be enacted by herself and her cousins. The self-composed play is in honor of the arrival of the Tallis' oldest son, Leon, who arrives with his friend. McEwan describes an innocuous and rather drab situation such as this with rich detail, which makes one wonder if there is actually a reason for intricacy.  <br /> <br />However, the plotline unravels slightly when the narration switches. The world is now seen through the eyes of Cecilia Tallis, Briony's older sister. Cecilia is hassled by the new developments in her relationship to Robbie Turner, the cleaning lady's son and her childhood friend. The two of them, in a fleeting moment of undeniable passion, cross the boundary from friends to lovers. Briony accidentally witnesses the act of consummation and, rudely awakened from her insularity, cannot comprehend the level of anger rising within her. She believes her beloved friend Robbie to have turned into a \\"maniac\\" in order to have engaged in such a sordid act with her sister. The anger then turns into contempt, both towards her sister and Robbie. This sequence of events is the pivotal point in the novel, the reason for the shattering of personalities for which atonement is necessary. Briony destroys the newly blossomed love between Robbie and Cecilia because of her virulent disdain for them by telling a horrible lie. This lie then haunts her for years to come and decides the fate of the lovers. <br /> <br />After the happenings of the fateful day are wrapped up, the reader is transported five years hence. McEwan's writing style is transformed into an absolute state of macabre. His initially sluggish prose is abandoned as he transforms the Tallis family into a household full of distrust, brought about as a result of a peculiar combination of disgust, malice and love. He makes full use of the morbidity of the English language in his depiction of the Tallis family and of the state of the world during the Second World War. We find that Robbie and Cecilia's love has withstood time and the war barely scars it. Cecilia has disowned her family and has cut off all contact with Briony. Briony takes up a vocation in nursing, tending to wounded soldiers day in and day out. She attempts at reconciliation with Cecilia, now having realized the shamefulness of her act. The readers growing annoyance with Briony's meddlesome behaviour is now transformed into that of sympathy- she has after all, acquired some sense of self-awareness and grown up.  <br /> <br />In the conclusion, McEwan offers a bizarre and bittersweet twist to a supposedly coming of age story. The play that is written in the summer of 1935, is re-performed at Briony's seventy-seventh birthday, who has now become a published novelist. In spite of her success, Briony ponders about the atonement of her treacherous crime. She asks herself \\"How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?\\"(Pg 372). The realization comes to her that the crime she committed can be atoned in her stories, but however cannot be atoned in reality. This brings out the veracity of the tale; in no real life situation is any crime, lie, or deceiving act brought to complete justice, andthe power of absolution is a far-fetched possibility to the people on the receiving end of an incorrect judgment. <br /> <br />A brilliantly constructed story, with enthralling characters and resounding themes of love, war, betrayal and absolution, Atonement serves as McEwan's masterpiece.
B000002USN|3.0|Really, the condition of Frank's voice, and the fact that he pre-recorded his parts doesn't bother me. Of course, it would have been ideal if Frank had made his duets album ten years earlier.<br /><br />This album had its flaws, but it didn't deserve the critical slam that it received at the time--and it didn't stop millions of people from loving it. It IS good, just not great. Duets II is actually better. The song choices are better, and Frank's voice was in better shape on those songs. I recomend both Duets 1 & 2.<br /><br />I hope someday that they release Frank's recordings of these songs before the duet partners were added, I'd like to hear the original cuts.
B000J10EQU|2.0|I'd heard lots of good buzz about this movie and in interviews, all of the cast and crew said the right things.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie is a huge disappointment (for me at least). Despite numerous references and homages to Superman(1978), this movie has none of the exuberance or charm of the first two Superman movies.  <br /> <br />The main problems are casting and the script: Routh lacks sufficient charisma as Superman and Bosworth is completely wrong for the role of Lois Lane.  Even Kevin Spacey's performance as Luthor is wrong- it's (intentionally) too similar to Hackman's. <br /> <br />Also, I can't believe that Singer would spend ~$200 million on a movie without a decent script or storyline.  Roger Ebert describes the movie as \\"lifeless\\"- I couldn't agree more- I couldn't stop checking my watch. <br /> <br />Bottom line: better than Superman III and IV, which isn't saying much.  <br />
0684803356|1.0|I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of \\"thy\\" and \\"thou\\" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, \\"How do you call yourself?\\" instead of \\"What is your name?\\" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is \\"How do you call yourself\\" better than \\"What is your name\\"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these \\"translations\\" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.

0553213105|5.0|Arguably Jane Austen's best work, Pride and Prejudice encompasses all the notable themes of her time- class, family, marriage, love and of course, pride. And Prejudice.<br /><br />The story has been dissected, narrated, adapted and recycled about a thousand times. Yet, for a plotline that is relatively simple and quite predictable, this book remains eternal. Jane Austen's vivid and witty prose makes you wish the book could be longer and that Elizabeth and Darcy's courtship would stretch out fifty (or hundred  with Austen's descriptive style) more pages!<br /><br />This is one of the best novels ever written. A classic that is invaluable and timeless!
B00005MP58|5.0|I was appalled by Hollywood's bizarre twentyfirst century ending to the recent movie. If you want authentic Jane Austen, short of going back in a time machine, you want this A&E production.<br /><br />Need I say that there is no Mr Darcy but Colin Firth?<br /><br />Also highly recommended - \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" - it is Bollywood meets Jane Austen, and the two suit each other quite well!
B000BZ9DKW|5.0|Ok people here are saying they got this at a lower price at another store.  Well ok im reviewing the movie not the price.  Get it from wearever you want.  This is a great set and a great movie.  I got a stapler, pad of paper, magnet,pen and a coffee cup.  The extras on this dvd are very good.  I watched something talking about Mike Judge that was really interesting and it has alot more little things that are interesting.  So no matter which store you get this from it is a great buy.  even if someone already has the original version.
B00005JO04|5.0|Syriana - Superb Movie: Especially compared to most of what comes out of Hollywood. There is actually acting and actually a number of sub-plots which are not completely explained to the viewer. Yes, it is not like an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard, where Uncle Jessie narrates everything for you so you can go to the fridge for a beer and not get lost as the plot develops. <br /> <br />I would give the movie high marks for being ambitious enough to try to paint a picture or montage of events, people, and stories related to a particular issue. I liken it to the movie Platoon.  <br /> <br />For those who are tempted to be overly critical, just remember, it is only a movie. <br /> <br />Oh, and one more thing...it is somewhat unpredictable. I like that.  <br /> <br />Cheers <br /> <br />Ashley Hockenberry
B00025ETIW|5.0|MCR are really on top of the world right now...the hottest thing in the music industry and rightfully so for their first major release 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' is a close to perfect album, delivering the best emo/goth/punk/metal sound around and doing so with style. <br /> <br />The albums first single 'I'm not Okay (I Promise)' was not on the top of my favorites list and thus I was not hooked into the web of MCR until hearing the next single 'Helena' and I was instantly a fan.  The song itself, the first track on the album, is the best song here by far and it's whole infectious vibe from lyrical content to the eerie intensity of the musical arrangment is pure brilliance.  Other favorites are 'The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You', the slower balladish single 'The Ghost Of You' and the fan favorite 'Thank You For The Venom'.  This album is awesome and well worth the purchase for it's something to be enjoyed over and over. <br /> <br />By the way, the video for 'Helena' featuring Helena Bonham-Carter is magnificent and captures the whole feel and air this song creates.  Perfect compliment indeed!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|As a newcomer to the band of Nightwish, This was the first album that I have come attached to. I was orriginally captured by the track 'Romanticide', But now I can account for the other tracks including the two bonus tracks on this CD. The Vocals on this album are so incredible, you will believe that you are appart of a movie at the most exciting part the whole time. If you but this album you will not be dissapointed at all, and you may also become attached to the other finnish rock bands the country has to offer.
B000FGGE68|2.0|It is a shame that this movie wasn't great.  It is a beautifully directed movie.  It has characters that are good in their roles and create depth with little to work with.  It has some incredible action sequences.  Milla Jovovich may be the most believable actress in an action role along side Carrie Anne Moss.  She looks athletic, like she can fight and she is a good actress.  The character of Ultraviolet is such a cool character that this movie should have told itself.  However, the plot is so bad that it makes you not care about any of these other factors as you watch this movie.  The plot is not easy to follow, and once you do follow it the motives behind the characters in their actions make litle sense.  Rent it, don't buy it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Goonies, the greatest 80's movie of all times, is one of those movies that doesn't ever get old to me.  I remember loving this movie as a kid, and as an adult, well, some things never change!  I can still quote most lines from this movie, and although that annoys some people, other people love to quote it right back at me.  The Goonies is an adventure from the get-go and it keeps you rooting for the Goonies the entire time while hating the Fratelli's.  Donner and Spielberg have created a timeless movie with all of the pure 80's goodness.  Let's face it: the hair, the outfits, the music, the sayings.  It's all outdated.  But the story and characters are timeless, and the movie is bursting with energy.  Sean Astin is gold in this movie, and I was glad to see him get his career back on track after The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  And can I say that I had the biggest crush on Kerri Green?!  Wow!  She was great in \\"Lucas\\" as well.  Corey Feldman, is well, he's Corey Feldman, and he's extremely annoying in the DVD commentary (so much so that his constant interrupting sends Sean Astin to leave and not come back!).  Chunk does a great Truffle Shuffle and other characters round out this wildly entertaining adventure.  And there are funny little mistakes in the movie (like Sean Astin calling Josh Brolin \\"Josh\\" instead of by his character's name \\"Brand\\" when they are in the basement), but the deleted scenes help answer some of those mistakes (like the octopus being scary).  Watching the deleted scenes makes you feel like it was the right decision that they were deleted because most of them DID NOT look good!  I am actually pretty happy that there never was a sequel as I think it probably wouldn't have been that good and that our expectations would be too high, and ultimately, all of us who loved the original would have been disappointed.  And I do agree that this movie is actually more like a PG-13 movie.  Too much unnecessary language that shouldn't have been there in the first place.t place.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I traded in all my Rammstein Albums, save this one. I don't listen to it often, but it is still a masterpiece.
0895260131|4.0|After reading this book and seeing alot of negative comments by what are probably followers of Islam and Mohammed I asked myself this question. Was Mohammed a peaceful man that he is made out to be?      One only has to look at the battle of Badr, where Mohammed attacked caravans of the Quraysh.  He  attacked the caravans for the wealth they were escorting, 'This caravan belongs to Quraysh, and will carry much wealth. Attack it; God may present it to you.' The men got ready, some pleased, others apprehensive because they had not thought the messenger of God would make war.\\" (Kathir, 253)     Many Muslims did not want to fight with Mohammed for they possibly believed that their faith was one of peace.   Mohammed was known for this type of tactic, so did it happen? Yes. Was he peaceful, hardly, more of a early version of a thug/train robber. Therefore one only needs to fiqure the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree.      Read the book, do some research and make up your own mind.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I really adore this album.  It has a nice mix of slow ballads and swinging big band standards.  My favorite song was written and composed by Michael and is called \\"Home.\\"  It actually has a more mainstream sound to it, but shows his versatility as a singer.  This is because he shows he isn't just an old soul crooner, but can pull off contemporary music as well. <br /> <br />His big band classics make me want to get up and dance without a care about how ridiculous I may look.  (Careful - his music can have that effect on a person!)  And he has this wonderful ability to take any cover song and make it his own.  His remakes take on a new life and his techniques are ingenious.      <br /> <br />Michael has one of those unique, mellifluous voices that warm the cockles of your heart, especially when he sings ballads.  I think he is the equivalent of Frank Sinatra for our generation.  He has managed to modernize music that spans over half a generation, yet stays true to the genre and musical integrity of the classics.     <br /> <br />
B00012QM86|4.0|When it comes to a movie about the Holocaust, you know you are going to get something emotional.  Spielberg does a good job with this as you follow characters and their motives.  Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a war profiteer, who slowly becomes emotionally involved with the Jewish people that he employs.  This transformation is key to the movie and is what makes it more than JUST a Holocaust film because it goes beyond the obvious.  Ben Kingsley also does a good job, playing a Jewish accountant named Stern, who also risks his life in smaller ways to help other Jews while at the same time deying odds and remaining alive.  But I think it is Ralph Fiennes that makes this movie powerful.  His depiction as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth will shock you while at the same time you feel that it is so utterly real what he is doing.  Tommy Lee Jones, who did a good job in the movie The Fugitive, SHOULD NOT have beat Fiennes for an Oscar for best supporting actor.  Fiennes will captivate you when he's on the screen, although you are not supposed to like him or his actions.  I enjoyed the black and white although I think it still would have been powerful in color.  I think there were parts that moved kind of slow, but all in all, this movie will make you think and it will open your eyes to a brutal reality of the Holocaust.  It's easy to see why Spielberg called this movie \\"the most satisfying experience of my career.\\"  I also recommend The Pianist with Adrien Brody and the HBO series Band Of Brothers, which also deals with similar themes.
B00006879E|1.0|Maroon 5 are a perfect example of how talentless your typical rock star is in the 21st century.  Their album Songs About Jane is a bunch of soulless two dimensional rubbish tailor made for MTV and the Top 40 FM radio format.  Top 40 FM radio rock like this is manufactured by the tonne in this day and age, not for the talent, but to make their record company a fortune in record sales.  Throughout the album, the songs are completely bland and mindless, with nothing interesting about them what so ever.  They just drag along in that monotone, FM radio friendly way.  The songs don't entertain you; they simply drone along and make no impression on the listener what so ever.  This is the kind of music that might sound good in an elevator or a doctor's waiting room, but other than that, there is no place for this bland garbage anywhere in our society.   <br /> <br />PS--Not only is the music bland, but the lead singer has the most annoying voice I've ever heard.  He sounds like he's just huffed a tank full of helium!

0920668372|1.0|My sister in law gave me this book as a baby shower gift.  She said she cries everytime she reads it.  Matter of fact she cried telling me she cries everytime she reads it.  I'm thinking, wow, this must be a good book...  WRONG.  I've read other reviews now that say it's creepy.. and they're right on.  Can I ask one question?   <br /> <br />WHY IS THE MOTHER CRAWLING????  That's weird.  Maybe when they're a baby and you don't want them to see you.. but why drive across town, breaking into your grown sons' house... then crawling across the floor? If she can handle a stick shift and a ladder, she's obviously capable of walking.  And the sing-songy refrain is odd too.. 'as long as I'm living'... that's a nice thought to put in a kid's head.  Hey, we're all mortal, oh yeah, and mommy will DIE one day... sweet dreams?  So odd. Just couldn't get past the crawling.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|baby daughter...mazel-tov. We've killed another  terrorist...mazel-tov. So it goes. On the surface it's all so simple. The 11 Israeli atheletes to the Munich Olympics in 1972 were murdered by Black September. Israel will seek out & kill individuals who knew or were responsible. They have a list of leaders. The  Massad recruits agent Avner played by Eric Bana & a team of specialist to find them. There are rules. The Massad & Prime Minister Golda Meir, who is sitting right there, must have credible deniability. The team is stripped of their identity. They are not well known, anyway. The must do the killing only in Europe & must not kill any innocent bystanders. Expolsions are the preferred method of assassination. They seem to have  unlimited funds from $$$ stashed in Swiss safety deposit boxes. They are sucessful but not as they planned. They must kill point blank with guns. They travel unauthorized to Lebanon & many innocents are killed. They make a side trip to Amsterdam simply to kill a female assassin very graphically in cold blood for killing a team member. She had come on first to Avner who thought of his sweet wife & turned down a vist to her room. So it becomes apparent while he is seeking out & killing terrorist he is in turn being hunted also. He fears for his family & has them moved to from Israel to Brooklyn. It is very hard to believe in the beginning, that Avnar is a stone cold agent. He is a handsome, young, modest family man that any mother (except his own) could love. But Speilberg hasn't made a mistake in the casting. The killing does take it toll, emotionally on Avnar. Speilberg hasn't drawn the terrorist as evil, villians deserving to be killed. They are somtimes gentle, urbane, respected family men. They are even likeable. They must die. Avnar quits & joins his family in Brooklyn. His sanity is in doubt.  <br />   In any case it doesn't matter. As soon as you kill a leader somone immediately rises to take their place. The more terrorist you kill, the more that sprout, like weeds. This is an above average thriller with little technical whiz bang. It has the additional virtue that some of it at least, is true.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome , Awesome. <br /> <br />DO NOT MISS THIS!!!!!!
B000002JSP|4.0|THE BAND: Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitars), John Paul Jones (bass, piano, synth & keyboards), John Bonham (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1979) 7 songs clocking in at approximately 43 minutes. The digitally remastered version released in 1994. Included with the disc is a 3-page foldout containing song titles/credits and all original album artwork. Robert Plant is credited on all 7 songs, Jimmy Page on 5, and (perhaps) surprisingly John Paul Jones on 6. This is Led Zeppelin's 8th and final studio album. Recorded at Polar Music Studio in Stockholm, Sweden. Label - Swan Song / Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: If I had to stack all of Led Zeppelin's albums together, this would end op being my least favorite Zeppelin album. Not to say that it's bad (which it definitely is NOT)... but it's simply not in that 'classic' category that ALL the other Zeppelin albums are in. In fact, if there's one disposable Zeppelin album, this is it. Dare to compare it to Led Zeppelin's \\"1-4\\", \\"Houses Of The Holy\\", \\"Physical Graffiti\\", or \\"Presence\\"... well, \\"In Through The Out Door\\" falls easily to the bottom of the list. Anyone who doesn't rank this album last (or close to it) is kidding themselves. This album has a totally different feel to it... almost 'commercial'. The hits - \\"Fool In The Rain\\", \\"In The Evening\\" and \\"All My Love\\" are downright pleasant. All good songs, but none of them crunch and shred like we know the ultimate guitar God can. You'll also notice that 6 of the 7 songs are co-authored by John Paul Jones - thus, extremely heavy on the keyboards/synthesizers. Page's guitar takes a back seat on several songs here. Authorized books on the band have mentioned Jimmy Page being so incapacitated due to his heroin addiction, that John Paul Jones actually stepped up during this time and and did most of the writing with Plant. \\"South Bound Saurez\\", and the ten-and-a-half minute \\"Carouselambra\\" are ultimately forgettable. \\"Hot Dog\\" belongs on a country & western album somewhere. The final cut, \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", is one of their weaker attempts at a rich library of blues tunes they've covered over the years. John Bonham died within months of this release. As far as the album cover is concerned - I've always wondered if there was a significance to it. This is a good rock album... simply not on par with anything the band had done to this point (3.5 stars).The final cut, \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", is one of their weaker attempts at a rich library of blues tunes they've covered over the years.

B000002U9Y|4.0|Rating: 4.25 Stars<br /><br />I find it quite amusing when the word \\"uneven\\" is used to describe \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" seeing that Syd Barrett's influence is still quite strong on this Pink Floyd effort.  That word takes on a new (and deeper) meaning when used in conjunction with anything associated with Syd.  Yet, \\"uneven\\" is an accurate assessment in that this release contains three classic Floydian adventures (\\"Let There Be More Light\\", \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\", and \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets'), one beautifully mellow Rick Wright composition (\\"Remember A Day\\"), and three real oddities (\\"Corporal Clegg\\", \\"See Saw\\", and \\"Jugband Blues\\") penned by Waters, Wright, and Barrett respectively.  To give you an idea of the nature of these three oddities, suffice it to say that they would have fit right in on Floyd's preceding album, \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\".<br /><br />The first three cuts; \\"Let There Be More Light\\", \\"Remember A Day\\", and \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\", are excellent and set an exceptional mood that is unfortunately broken by the fourth cut, \\"Corporal Clegg\\".  The first grouping of three consists of sonic abstractions loaded with plenty of keyboard, guitar, and percussion set in perfect counterpoint to Roger Water's steady bass lines.  \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is stark and bare in comparison, substituting instead heaviness and, eventually, frivolity in place of the mind-bending excursions found in the first three compositions.  Taken by itself, \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is a very good tune but I have always had a difficult time fully appreciating it in its position as the fourth cut on \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" after such a stellar beginning.  Fortunately, the title cut re-establishes the mood set by the first three songs and is quite a psychedelic adventure in and of itself.  \\"See Saw\\" continues the adventure on a far less serious note taking the listener to a fairy tale playground and somewhat preparing them for the closing gem, \\"Jugband Blues\\", penned by the Crazy Diamond himself.<br /><br />Far more than simply a transitional album, \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" profiles a maturing band that is still performing on the edge of lunacy while transitioning onto a more focused and purposeful musical path.  As it is with all of their pre-\\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" releases, I cautiously recommend \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" to those who are only familiar with the \\"rock radio\\" edits from this fine band.  If you had trouble relating to the albums that those radio-friendly edits came from, then this one is probably not for you.  However, if you think that you are up to the challenge, this album may very well expand your musical horizon beyond anything you might have hoped for and, consequently, send you off on a mission to experience other early Pink Floyd offerings as well.em, \\"Jugband Blues\\", penned by the Crazy Diamond himself. <br /> <br />Far more than simply a transitional album, \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" profiles a maturing band that is still performing on the edge of lunacy while transitioning onto a more focused and purposeful musical path.

0060005696|5.0|This book is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The basic premise of this book is that the more choice we have, the more anxious we become about the decisions we have to make. Think for example, about how many different stores there are in a mall. You want to buy a dress shirt, but which store do you go into? Will the Gap have a better deal than Banana Republic? Or maybe Macy's or Lord & Taylor will have a better shirt. But then, which shirt do you pick once you decide what store to walk into? All these decisions prove to be quite exhausting, despite our unconscience ability to make such them on a constant basis. <br /> <br />Don't believe me cause Im just another dude? Well, it was required reading in my psychology class on personal security at The Ohio State University. Had a great professor...this book changed how I make decisions in everyday life.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|(4 & 1/2 stars) I first got interested in Muse because of their prog-rock leanings, but I've stayed with them as a band with a bunch of exciting musical ideas, as demonstrated in abundance on Black Holes.  The diversity of songs on this CD is impressive, from quietly acoustic to all-out hard rock.  I was amazed that there's even a tune with a bit of the Prince-ish 80's funk sound (\\"Starlight\\").  Then there's the adventurous Radiohead-esque electronic rock of \\"Take A Bow\\" and \\"Map of the Problematique.\\"  The musical is all pretty great, but add in the sci-fi themes of the CD (I'm a SF buff too) and the album package by an excellent design team that includes the legendary and amazing Storm Thorgerson, and the Black Holes CD is just about unbeatable - almost 5 stars, not quite.

B00001OH7P|5.0|I LOVE this album and think its both Bowie's best and essential to any record collection. <br /> <br />Sparing you the track-by-track run down, I just want to add my two favorite parts of this classic disc: <br /> <br />1) \\"Five Years\\"   <br />This track is NEVER played on the radio but is so absolutely masterful it will blow your mind.  The entire song is one long creschendo, and at its climax is the most soul-sucking, gut-wrenching rock-and-roll scream ever recorded.  The lyrics - about reactions to the announcement that the world will come to an end in five years - are incredibly original and evocative (\\"My brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare.  I had to cram so many things to store everything in there.\\", \\"I thought I saw you in an ice cream parlor drinking milkshakes cold and long.\\", \\"The newsguy wept and told us, earth was really dying.  He cried so much his face was wet.  Then I knew he was not lying\\".  Put this track on repeat and drink it in. <br /> <br />2. The *transition* between \\"Soul Love\\" and \\"Moonage Daydream\\". <br />Afficianados of this album know that on the back of the album cover are the famous words \\"TO BE PLAYED AT MAXIMUM VOLUME\\".  A cool rock-and-roll packaging trick to be sure, HOWEVER - I've not seen anyone write about one of the REASONS behind this directive. <br />\\"Soul Love\\" is a very slow-tempo, meandering and relatively mellow track which, as it progresses, lulls you into a kind of a trance.  The pacing is very steady, and toward the end of the song you can tell that it will end in a very long fade-out, and you expect this to happen along with the usual silence between tracks.   INSTEAD, what you are treated to is the THURDEROUS opening riff of \\"Moonage Daydream\\" - probably the loudest sound on the entire album!!!  That monster riff and the immortal words \\"I'M AN ALLIGATOR, I'M A MOMMA-PAPPA COMING FOR YOU!\\" - when played at MAXIMUM VOLUME - will surprise and scare the living ---- out of you!  THAT is why the album coverexhorts you to play it at maximum volume!
1573301183|5.0|\\"On the evening of April 10th, 1996, 400 lucky people witnessed the public emergence of Alice In Chains at the MTV Unplugged stage in New York\\" - unfortunately I wasn't one of them because I was born in neither the right time or place! GRRR it really sucks growing up in the music scene that's around to day.  Anyway, on to the review, this performance has to be the most breathtaking performance I have ever seen for the following reasons:      The songs performed were some of Alice In Chains greatest songs, other than 1 mistake in the opening minute of \\"sludge factory\\" the songs were performed floorlessly, Layne Staley's deteriorating health (which although very tragic) made the atmosphere so much more emotional, it lasts for an hour which is a perfect amount of time for a live performance (for me at any rate as some long concerts can bore me after a while) and finally because this was completely about music and no diversions unlike some concerts where there are a bunch of lighting effects, stage props, stunts and acts (which are good at times, don't get me wrong about that), but with this performance it was just 5 guys (including Scotty Olsen the back up guitarist) walking up on to a candle lit stage in their jeans and t shirts in front of a fairly small audience and giving it their all.    My personal highlights from Alice In Chains unplugged include: \\"Nutshell\\" - an absolutely spectacular concert opener and possibly my all time favourite song period), \\"Brother\\", \\"Sludge Factory\\" (in particular when Layne removes his shades to reveal his heroin abused eyes which compliments the feel of the song so well), \\"Angry Chair\\" - Layne's chance to show his guitar playing ability on a song he wrote all himself and \\"Would\\" which they did well to perform unplugged as before watching it I wasn't too sure how they would pull it off.    If you like Alice In Chains and haven't seen this, for god sake buy it now and you really will be amazed.
B000EWBKK8|5.0|This is partly in response to the 1 star review. I don't know what kind of system he is using, but on my 37 inch 1080p LCD display this blu-ray disk looks WAY better than DVD. <br /> <br />That said, could it be a better? Sure it could. But it's ridiculous to slam this movie for that. The detail is actually amazing in most of the picture. I can see pores of skin, blood vessels in eyes, small grit, and other sharp details throughout. <br /> <br />If you want a movie that makes the DVD version look ugly this will fit the bill. If you can't tell the difference you need glasses or a new HDTV.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Okay, I can see why someone could dislike this movie. There is cheesy dialogue and an almost incoherent plot, but even that are a faithfull adaptation of the videogame. I really think this was made intentional, and  If you aren't a fan of the series you'll probably hate. I'm sure this is the best videogame to movie adaptation i've ever seen.They respected every single aspect of silent hill i can think off. I have some obsession with silent hill (I've played all the games, and own all of the soundtracks and comics) and this game means a lot to me.  I was expecting the movie since it was only a rumor, and i was expecting a horrible movie, like resident evil, but i found myself in the movie theater trembling just like in the game, with a big smile every time they included a silent hill videogame reference. Piramid head was great, and the atmosphere in general where as true to the game as it can be.  They also made a lot of scenes identical to ones in the videogame, and with an original story as good as the ones in the series.  Even if this isn't a horror masterpiece, this is definitely a must-have to every single silent hill fan. This is a movie made by fans to fans, so, if you don't like the series you wont like this one. eventhough i've met some people who haven't played the game and loved it.
B000002UZ1|5.0|If you're a casual fan looking for more than what \\"1\\" gives you, this is pretty much your only other collection option. It's also basically the later part of the earlier set \\"1962-1966\\", and the two 2-disc collections obviously go together well. Each disc here is roughly 50 minutes, and while it could hold many more songs, you still get 28 classics here. Even without the \\"62-66\\" set this is more than what's on \\"1\\", though short their early work. This also gives numerous tracks off each album, including both \\"Sgt Peppers\\" and \\"The Beatles (White Album)\\". Plus of course the hits from \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"Let It Be\\", and other singles. Anybody could add more or different songs to this, but it's really hard to complain when the music is this good. Again, for the casual fan, this 1967-70 (blue set) is almost a must to get with the 62-66 (red set). Oh, and I heard their proper albums are pretty good too. Enjoy.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|being a muse fan, its hard to tell if this album is really better than their previous releases, then again being a muse fan, you may be happy with just hearing Matt Bellamy's falsetto on new tracks.  <br /> <br />This album is full of strong political themes:  <br />- Take A Bow is a great opening track, electric!  <br /> <br />- Starlight is an interesting song; matt's opening piano playing is great, but i felt the lyrics in the song were a little weak. <br /> <br />- Supermassive Black Hole is easily Muse' most different sounding track...while i didn't like it at first, the track does grow on you and chris' bass is really great! <br /> <br />- Map Of The Problematique is first highlight of the album and really showcases matt's vocals <br /> <br />- Soldier's Poem is the first ballad of the album; very touching song about a soldier questioning his government's intentions... <br /> <br />- Invincible is being touted by many as an anthem in the wake of the World Cup, but in my opinion it is possibly the low point of the album <br /> <br />- Assassin: this is the new \\"stockholm syndrome\\" in my opinion, very cool track <br /> <br />- Exo-politics: great baseline, another highlight on the album, even if the subject of the song focuses on aliens? <br /> <br />- City Of Delusion: yet another song questioning \\"the powers that be\\"; has a cool trumpet playing through the middle of the song <br /> <br />- Hoodoo: the second ballad, very powerful lyrics <br /> <br />- Knights Of Cydonia: the best song on the album, the intro is very epic; the chorus is like a tribute to the band Queen. As for the grand finish, a riveting bass which makes this song easily the best on the album <br /> <br />There is a question of which of these tracks Muse would perform live; some maybe more difficult than others, but this is a solid outing for the band and should warrant them more exposure.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I saw the complete Paradise Concert original in 1981 on the TV. I asked myself where is this concert. Why it is not on sale????. Therefore, this \\"Reopening Paradise Concert\\" is EXCELLENT. But where is the \\"Care\\" song singing by Tommy Shaw in the Paradise tour 1981???.
B000002U9W|5.0|On the passing of Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett, I noticed quite a bit of celebration of Barrett's work.  I had not paid attention to him before, so I listened to some of the clips here on Amazon of Barrett's best.   <br /> <br />Folks: Atom Heart Mother is real music, and much better music than anything I heard from the late Mr. Barrett's selections.  I say this not to speak ill of Mr. Barrett, but to encourage serious music enthusiasts to give The Cow Album renewed consideration. <br /> <br />The title track of Atom Heart Mother is a suite of rock and symphonic-influenced mini-compositions expertly performed and woven.  The \\"Funky Dung\\" interlude delivers some of the clearest most precise blues-rock you'll ever hear. <br /> <br />Did you like \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" (the long version)? <br />Did you like Days of Future Passed (Moody Blues)? <br />Then sit back, with good quality headphones, and explore Atom Heart Mother.   <br /> <br />Parts you'll like, parts might annoy you, but this is music to study and think about.  Spotlight in your mind the horns, the voice work, the bass lines, the drums, the sound effects. See which parts work best for you.   <br /> <br />I wore out my first copy, in vinyl, doing just that back in 1972 :-)  <br /> <br />P.S.:  Don't judge the album by the 30 second clips here on Amazon -- they just don't give it justice and a couple of them end up sampling portions of the songs that are quiet sound effects.  You have to hear the album itself.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I originally heard from someone I barely knew that this CD wasn't very good and not really worth buying but then a friend of mine said it was pretty sweet. I decided to trust the person I knew better and bought the CD to find out for myself. After listening to it only a few times I already really like it. Some of it is slower than the normal Red Hot Chili Peppers but I like it. I really like what this CD stands for lyrically and musically...there are some really awesome guitar parts! Buy this CD, especially if you're already a fan, just be open minded while listening to it.
B000065U1N|4.0|As I watch this film I am reminded of how americans are put in harms way every day. It is a sad story to see that conflicts like somalia and the sudan only make headlines for a short time before our 24 hour news cycle is on to the next issue. I hope that the leaders of our nation have watched this film and learn something about urban combat and how to ensure the american lives are not lost.
B00005JNJV|2.0|Ok, it's been awhile since we as an audience have been treated to a darker, edgier Batman...and as I sat down to watch BATMAN BEGINS, I was excited to finally have that chance.  If only the folks involved in the writing process had tried to come up with a stronger, more seasoned script. <br /> <br />First, I felt very bad for poor Liam Neeson, who was left to spout a few forgettable Yoda-style lines.  What a waste...when you have honest acting talent like Neeson, USE IT!  And Christian Bale did a good job with what he'd been given, however, I've never seen a Bruce Wayne who was as clueless and stupid as the one this movie delivered.  (His on-screen flame, a character played by Katie Holmes, seemed to have more common sense).  The best performances really came from Gary Oldman (who, I'm convinced, couldn't turn in a bad performance in any movie) and Cillian Murphy (unfortunately, his character was given -what?- maybe five minutes of actual screen time). <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong: it is nice to see a Batman who isn't surrounded by ice-skating snowmen/burglars or spinning neon lights (as in the horrible Joel Shumacher outings).  But really...a sonic machine that attacks the town's water supply?  A group of secret assassin ninja spies who want nothing more than to leave Gotham City in ruins?  Although almost everything was there: all the elements to make a really good, really dark movie for the Dark Knight, it's the \\"almost\\" that leaves me wishing I had seen a better film.  It only needed a strong story (with a blelievable, credible threat for Batman to face) to carry it all through, and sadly, that's the one thing the movie didn't have.
0440234743|4.0|Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle.
0618477942|5.0|I have been a fan of Dykes to Watch Out For, Bechdel's pitch-perfect and depthy comic strip about a group of lesbians and their friends, since high school about twelve years ago, and the arrival of a new work by Bechdel is always an event to be heralded by the same day purchase of her book and my holing up with chocolates to read it all the way through.<br /><br />This one was a little different than the Dykes series, though, because its complexity, both in the drawings and the writing, really deserved a slower-paced reading so I could ponder all of the literary connections she made, and the thoughts and actions that brought up so many interesting feelings and thoughts in me.<br /><br />Bechdel's Dad owned the local Funeral Home (the \\"Fun Home\\"), and restored their old home to museum-like glory, obsessively painting, rearranging, and disallowing the personal touches and tastes of his wife and kids in favor of period pieces of furniture and decoration.<br /><br />Between the Fun Home and the restoration, Alison starts to show us the stilted way in which her father is living and forcing them all to live. Why does he need to have such control over his surroundings?<br /><br />It is only when Bechdel is away at college that she discovers lesbianism and realizes that her differences have a name. When she comes out to her parents, she discovers the secret that her parents had been trying to keep under cover for years.<br /><br />Alson and her Dad are both voracious readers, and their stories are shown against a backdrop of classic and other books, which makes the experience of her autobiography (to this point) so much richer.<br /><br />This is a five star hit that I think deserves a lot of attention from people who aren't usually comic readers. The success of Persepolis and a few other mainstream graphic novels have paved the way for this to be a hit. I will certainly be recommending it to all of my book friends.
B00003CXCT|4.0|It took a long time for them to finally get here but it is worth it. I am now able to watch the first movies with my family. It is interesting to see how my son reacts to the original movies vs the new CAD/high tech episodes. I espically like some of the additional footage that was deleted from the theater versions.
B000002KD9|5.0|I must say, I agree with David Ludd, that the editorial review does not do this classic album justice, and Neil's phrase about 'mother nature on the run' is so obviously an ecology statement that it is bewildering how anyone claiming to be a reviewer could see it as a 'riddle'. <br /> <br />Neil's versatility is legendary, and the man who gave us one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, Harvest Moon, and the rock anthem Like A Hurricane, built an incredibily solid foundation with this timeless album. <br /> <br />While we all have our favorites, this is one of those rare albums where you could almost pick a track at random and it would be a classic. <br /> <br />To me, the man has never put out a bad album, but this is one that will ensure his musical immortality.
