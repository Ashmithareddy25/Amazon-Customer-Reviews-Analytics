B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very simple, but addicitve game. I originally got it because it was free and looked like it would be colorful and entertaining for a short while. A month later, I still find myself playing &#34;just one game&#34; before shutting off my Kindle Fire for the night.<br /><br />There are currently four ways to play, from the easy and relaxing untimed puzzle mode to the very difficult cube attack mode. The five-minute mode was just added via update which shows this developer has not created the game and abandoned it. That is always a good sign that any problems with the software may actually be resolved or at least responded to by communicating with the company.<br /><br />I'd recommend the puzzle mode as a fun way for youngsters to learn colors, numbers, and shapes.
1608871088|5.0|Such a lovely art book, definitely worth buying. A lot of detail and stunning works with lots of information about the process of creating this beautiful movie :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After several years, I decided to read Grisham again, and I was not dissapointed.<br />Maybe a bit different than expected, but absolute in line with the books I read years ago.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Morrie is someone you would just instantly fall in love with just for being himself.<br />You change your perspective on things after you read this book, and it's just a good read.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It was hard to get past Tom Cruise as jack because he is just too darn short. BUT once I suspended that judgment, I enjoyed the movie.quite a bit. The action was classic jack Reacher. A good way to spend an evening if you are a fan of the Reacher books.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I switched to Feedly when Google announced the demise of Reader. But it's actually better. It's a pleasant interface that organizes all my feeds. What else could I want?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This true life conflict felt utterly contemporary to me. The scenes in Iran and Washington rang true. Sometimes it was more like a documentary than an adventure film. The acting was excellent and the characters believable. A chilling commentary on decision making in the government.  It seems like little has changed in the years since the Iran hostage crisis.  The action had me on the edge of my seat. Definitely recommended.
B000OLRH1A|4.0|I'm a teacher and this movie along with documentaries has given my students an insight into the diamond business that mere words could not. I'm just sorry that Djimon Hounsou didn't win an Oscar for his role, he was phenomenal!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I bought this app for my kids, and ended up playing it myself!  It is a great concept, and a lot of fun.  My kids are are constantly asking me how to spell words so they can create the items and pass the levels.  It is a ton of fun.
0393345084|4.0|Really good read. While i wish there were a few more references and sources in a few sections, overall the book does a great job demonstrating how a real stimulus can do a lot of good, for example an infrastructure investment a few years ago would have been great in terms of increasing economic growth compared to debt (which is often neglected when comparing Debt to GDP ratio) and also improve the average infrastructure grade of a D, with the highest grade being a C+. While I don't believe nearly unlimited stimulus is best (which is not suggested in the book), having a larger stimulus would have definitely been a better choice than the current policy that is being followed, aka Austerity (which not long ago had a huge hit when a well renowned study by Reinhart-Rogoff, was demolished).
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a love-song to the 80's, a wonderful tribute to proto-geek culture and pop history, and on the whole, a rousing fun adventure story. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|I loved every minute of reading this book. It is sheer comic genius. I'm amazed I could love such a pompous buffoon.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|Clean, easy to use, fast and effective!  What a mobile app should be.  Impressed with how well it cleans up my Kindle Fire.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was the best film I have watched in years.  Subtly acted, warm, funny, lovely, loving, excellent!  Made me believe in love again.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|This app is OK but would benefit from a streamlined version for easier use on the move.  And I can't get the radar to work....
B005UG542S|5.0|LOVE this movie. Came in plastic wrap so I know it's not been tampered. It's in great condition and arrived on time.
B008I34ZFW|2.0|This movie put a good deal of effort into advertising itself as good dumb fun on SciFi sites.<br /><br />It is in fact a pitch black comedy that goes political early and stays that way.<br /><br />The effects are good for the amount of money they had to spend which is the reason I gave it two stars. The acting is really uneven.<br /><br />Clearly the makers have talent, but I did not enjoy this at all.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season. The show did a great job of pulling you in from the beginning. I would recommend it to anyone!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I can check the weather for my area as well as places I visit frequently without have to enter the places I want to check on. All I have to do is same the places on my favorite places and bingo, there they are, just one click away. By far the BEST weather app I've used!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best social media app ever made! I love having an app to go to that is my own, where I can have craft ideas, recipes, fashion,and much more saved to my boards. I love,love this app.
1442444053|5.0|this is one of the few true literally classics from the modern era.  anyone who loves their fiction in depth should try this book at least once.  great for most ages.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|beautiful deep rich sound.  heavy vinyl should last forever,  well pleased with this one. a must for sci fy fans.
B0027MJU00|4.0|So sad and heartbreaking. A real page turner. The characters really came to life, it feels as if you were in their shoes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAMEEEEEEE U HVEEEEEE TO GEETTTTTT ITTTTTTTT! It is a great waste time and it works great !!!!<3<3
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|Stupid waste of film. Flimsy plot, reeeeeally dumb ending. Was hoping for constant jump out at you scares, and this did not deliver that. Isn't that why we watch them?
B0025WX2YW|4.0|A very enjoyable series that gave a close timeline to historical accuracy. The acting was top notch. There were times that like most film productions, it was over dramatized as compared to what it would have been in real life situations. All in all though I enjoyed each of the four season series.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|To be honest; didn't expect much from this book. I have to say that I was hooked immediately and devoured it in a weekend. It's a great read, a real page-turner, and has a great light-hearted tone even when dealing with Life & Death situations. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Very entertaining. Loved everything about it. Very descriptive. Easy to follow and to read.<br />Got super excited that kept on reading the rest.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This man lived such an interesting life and his music is a tribute to that living.  If you have not heard him totally suggest this for listening pleasure.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I had high expectations about this one, but it was a bit boring and slow to read. It wasn't like the first one; I couldn't put the first one down because I wanted more. This one didn't give me the same expectations.n
0544002318|5.0|Excellent read and very inspirational.  Scott Jurek remains humble despite his many wins and inspires one to embark on a more nutritional way of life.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked it, but I liked the first one the most. I liked that had some unexpected turns. I wasn't too happy about the end.
B00BJZJXWG|3.0|This album is alright but Open, the first track, is stop you in your tracks beautiful. The rest of the album fails to live up to its strong beginning but I would have happily paid $7 just for Open, so maybe they should just be thought of as bonus tracks.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|The Lord of The Rings, and The Hobbit, sadly were constructed to aim at the 15-25 year old action movie market. I do not see a coherent method of maintaining the tome of the novels while capturing the attention of an audience that has no intention of delving into the complexities (and rewards) of JRR Tolkien's works. It just cannot be done. I have to assuage my outrage and depression by acknowledging the books, were at least created. Sadly the author ran out of time. Can a (mostly computer generated) SILMARILLION make up for LOTR and the Hobbit? Being it was mostly a narrative account, perhaps. One can only hope.
B00CW665VI|5.0|An amazing must read!! Love that it from Drew's POV!! Tangled is such a fun & romantic book!! Loved every bit of this book!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very intriguing writer. Twists and turns you donot expect! Baldacci keeps you reading until the end when there always is a surprise in there for you!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Great backdrops and costumes. Well developed story line. .worth seeing.  I also liked the variety of characters introduced throughout. Keeps you engaged.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|The robots have done it again.<br />I was keeping up with the news about RAM and I was SO hyped for it. When the album released I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, it's very 70's and 80's. The entire album is fantastic, but I find myself going back to Giorgio by Moroder, Instant Crush, Get Lucky, Touch, Contact and Within.<br />BE WARNED, this doesn't sound like EDM that we know of. The album is a tribute to DANCE music as a whole. But if you accept that, feel free to give it a listen.<br />I bought the physical album because the robots can have my money. They deserve it.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|I have two plates and 14 screws in my left leg that have always bothered me when I did anything high impact so I never considered running. I am now running 5ks almost every day. I don't feel sore and I have no aches or pains. It's amazing. I'm still a slow runner but at least I'm doing it and loving it thanks to this book!
1421550644|5.0|Written over 10 years, Nausicaa is Miyazaki's masterwork. The story is sprawling, complex, and detailed, and the characters well drawn and memorable. Nausicaa herself aside even, one of my enduring favourite literary characters is Kushana.
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|No violence, no special effects, no gratuitous sex -- just dialogue between two marvelous actors, to the extent that, after not too long, you lose awareness that these people are acting, working from a script, etc.  The sequel is even more of the same, which would ordinarily be tiresome, but the synergy between the two main (only) characters is so strong that it's easy to forget you're watching a movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The Misremembered Man, at first, seems sweet & predictable. The setting is rural Ireland. spanning the early 60's through the 90's. You think that you are simply reading a boy meets girl story, but there are many other things at play, not least of which are the boy's flashbacks to his painful childhood in one of the Catholic run orphanages of the time. Enlightening, funny at times & often heart twrenching.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like these books. Boy was I wrong. I loved them.  Can wait to read more. The story didn't drag but kept me glued to my kindle. Bring on more silos.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Even though this book stands very well on its own, I can't wait for the next book in the series.  It was a little difficult for me to get past the first small section of the book.  But once it switched perspectives after just a couple of \\"pages\\" I was hooked. The characters are rich and the plot is exciting.
B004UPANGM|1.0|I could only stand to watch about 4 minutes of this garbage. Then I had to decide whether to vomit or jump out the window.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Hard to put down. Better than Kite Runner. Can not wait to read next book by Hosseini in the coming days.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|As a fan of Ethan Hawke and horror movies I thought this would be a good film to watch. I wasn't disappointed. It is well acted and the story is gripping. Some very nice scary bits to keep you on your toes. Ok so the dead children don't look too scary and Mr.Boogie could be the Joker but it was still better than the average tosh horror movie.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I recomend it. It is a combination of a comedy and a drama . the story seems real and very close to the heart
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read for those proud of God family and the US.  Whether a ex veteran or not a must read in these times.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|This movie is by far one of his best! Frankenweenie makes multiple appearances during our family movie night selection. The claymation and animation are stellar. Should have won the Oscar!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I thought it was kind of boring and not much of a story base to it, would not watch it again.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|My husband and I enjoy the show. We replay it often. It has everything from romance, sex, masculine fighting and strategy. We love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive. I just want to keep playing it in order to unlock and upgrade everything. I can't put it down.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A quick easy to follow step by step book on how to create your digital book. So easy I was able to use it to publish my first book, Only Human. Very thankful for this resource and will continue to use it as reference in my career.<br /><br />Cheers
B007IXWL2C|2.0|MY DAOGHTER ORDERED IT FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.  I HAEN'T HAD TIME TO FINISH IT YET.  SHE GOT ME THE HONEYMOON VERSON BY MISTAKE.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have purchased every Paramore album, and could not resist buying this one either. Their sound is slightly different in this one, but in a good one. They rely less on the preteen emo misfit sound and move in a happier and upbeat direction. If you are a fan of their old stuff or looking for something new, this album will not disappoint.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I ONLY GOT ON FACEBOOK TO SEE PICTURES OF MY GRANDSON SINCE I DON'T GET TO SEE HIM THAT OFTEN.  THEY LIVE TWO HOURS AWAY.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was having a major problem with battery drain, and I couldn't figure out why.  I had installed a couple of other \\"cleaner\\" programs, and they didn't help.  When I installed this one, it has a feature showing exactly what is using what percentage of battery.  For some reason Rhapsody kept running in the background constantly!  I hadn't even listened to Rhapsody in forever.  So I uninstalled Rhapsody, and presto!  Now my Kindle is holding battery charge for days as it had in the past.  So happy to have found this little gem of an app!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This quit working after one week.  I am not sure if it is my Kindle, which is only 7 months old, but it does charge on another old phone cord I have.  The cord that came with it doesn't work either.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|If I were a kid, I probably would have thought this were a scary movie,  however I am not. It has some parts of the movie that are visually scary due to kids don't walk that way,  and people don't walk on the ceiling,  but that's about it.  The story itself is decent and the acting ok,  transitions in the movie are very choppy, odd as if they were making spots for commercial breaks.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like the interactive map.. but would like to be able to pin point my weather forecast like the NOAA site.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I loved the family drama and the teenage issues.<br />If you like legal dramma, you will love this!<br />Actors are very believable.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game was an amazing mind boggling, thriller, joy ride on getting thorough seven rooms. This is the best game.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I decided to preview this movie before downloading to my Kindle to watch on a flight(I like to watch good movies over and over) and glad I did.  First, I wouldn't want to watch the short but sexual scenes on a plane, second, it was just too dark of a movie that I don't want downloaded on my Kindle.  Sort of depressing even though the acting was good.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|A new sound, with tastes of the past. The robots have been teasing us for too long, but I promise the wait was worth it. Not as many club tracks on this one, more of a sit down and listen album. Don't worry about a letdown though, Daft Punk proves why they deserve the longevity they enjoy; Random Access Memories is pure musical genius.
B0019TSI8W|2.0|Though I like Jeff Bridges and Barbra Streisand, this movie was really mixed up.  I wouldn't recommend it (though I've seen worst).
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This is a great love story about a couple who struggle with mental illness but end up finding each other as the best therapy for them.  A comedy with a serious subject that lets you laugh and cry.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Use for church work and home. Can get to verses quicker than in print. Also love the devotionals. Wish I could flip back & forth between verses quicker.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|If you liked Firefly, then Serenity will be a familiar and pleasant experience for you. The characters maintain their same quirky personalities, right down to the silly cursing.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I loved it. One of my favorites. I wanted to see it again before I went to see Into Darkness, which was even better than the first one.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|passes the time, good games, i'm not quick but have to keep the brain workin and this sure helps :)
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Evernote works, but the interface and simplicity get very low marks. There is so much wasted space, and instead of being focused around YOUR notes, what you spend most of your time doing is navigating between menus and looking at pre-set category icons.
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|Pollan writes beautifully, his words flow off the page fluently, like a narrative, but talking not of non-fiction but the grounding and sobering reality of how disconnected in our daily lives many of us in western society have become from the food that we eat. He discusses how specialisation and commercialisation of food preparation and production have made us feel that we no longer have the skills or knowledge to complete the basic task of nourishing ourselves with a home-made healthy meal. Using the age-old earth-fire-water-air model of elements, he is able to demonstrate the beauty and inherent and contradictory simplicity-and-complexity of the transformations of basic ingredients into nourishing meals with a chapter each devoted to roasting, basting, bread and fermentation to explore these in depth. He writes from experience, having spent time with experts in each of these fields of cooking, and narrates the stories with skill and succinct detail. In 'Cooked', Pollan creatively explains and then demonstrates and advocates for a passive resistance to the destructiveness of commercialisation and specialisation of meal preparation that leave individuals feeling isolated, helpless and dumb in a wonderfully structured and exceptionally written book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|But sad :( I cried too much.... but its a good show to make you cry..I really cannot wait until next season.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very useful in the morning when I want to take my walk to the beach. Think the time for sunrise is mire accurate than The Weather Channel's so.
0316056898|5.0|This is a fast, enjoyable read that will make you laugh a lot. It's autobiographical, self-deprecating tone is a gift – everyone should be able to not take themselves so seriously.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I never watched these in Jr or High school. Now I can see why folks loved them. Thank you, Amazon, for making them available. Watching on my new iPad!
B008602KQI|4.0|The film was true to the book, so it was a good view. Will definitely come back to watch book two.
B00AA2W4L6|5.0|I am very harsh on movies, but this is perfection in my opinion. Everything from acting to graphics to the story is wonderful.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|KISS is back in fine form!  They really rock it on this one and you won't find any power ballads/
B00571F26Y|5.0|To teach an Adult..  Tell them What to. Do,  How to do it and Why...  Dr.  Davis has filled that need completely...  Now, after this info about Wheat...If an Adult is Stupid enough to continue eating Wheat....  They have to be very young and Never had Any Illnesses YET!!!!!  Those of Us that Want to Live Long and be Healthy Will Be Thankful of learning about No Wheat for Us....  Yyeeaaaa!!  Thank You,  Dr. Davis!
B00CHILW64|5.0|Very moving video. Good actors in it. The Young son plays a good part and plays it well. This is a very interesting and attention keeping video.
B006RJTEIC|3.0|Heard about it for years and never knew what it was. Lots of beautiful young people, most of whom don't live long enough to be anything except beautiful and shallow. Suddenly everything changes. A young move or a movie for the young.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Good sound effects. Good chararcters. It will hold your interest if you like playing Hangman. Categories are good and words are good also.
B001808CY2|3.0|... did not incorporate the snatcher pod that we're all used to seeing and that makes the movie somewhat unrecognizable to us. The barfing portrayed this more of an illness that can be cured than an alien takeover and that is why the movie didn't sit well with snatcher-ites. They deviated way too much from the last two story plot. The trademark scream was also taken out, that scream that ran chills up your spine.<br /><br />If your into chase movies this is it.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Good video. This has godd Actor in it too. Good for all ages. I would recommend this dvd or movie to all.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is addictive because you want to know what happens next and the current actor who plays the king of hell is super cool as well! I love everything about the show the action the players it is great.
B00866JL96|5.0|Read the book too. This is a good remake of the book. It makes you want to believe in people and that anyone can change.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This series is a one of a kind creation because they are making the DC Universe belivable by making each hero and villian that comes along without superpowers it is like making all the players into a Batman with skill and Brains instead<br />of cheating with Unbelivable Powers. The Martial art Technics are super cool which make up for the super powers and<br />makes everthing more Real and Honest a Perfect show and should never be canceled. I hope Batman has a spot on the<br />show I love this Series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever! it has a girl in it which is so awesome.<br />because girls are a little bit stronger than boys
B003YOMNCM|5.0|Tschaikovsky, Higden, and Hahn.  Love it!!  Now add Royal Philharmonic and your cup runeth over.  Buy it, then sit back and bask in the fact that you bought it.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I really havnt tried pintrest yet Not sure of my self on the tablet If I once learn I may really enjoy it as I love to see new recipies
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|Probably my favorite album of 2013. I enjoyed this album more so than Joe Budden's (and his was good). This album is a must have, especially if you're a will.i.am fan!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love face book because I found long lost cousins on it from my home town I tell every one  about it
B007N8RULO|4.0|Ienjoy to play it,  make thing all posibilities of every game<br /> I say, try it, you just have a lot  fun trying
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game Very much Never played it before. It seems to go well on the tablet,for me  thank you
B003QS9TKU|2.0|I guess I am in the minority on this movie, but I found it rather dull.  It had an interesting story line, but got bogged down with boring songs and overly long dance routines.  Probably would have made a good 90 minute movie.<br /><br />Improbabilities in the relationships also hurt the story.  Despite being forced to take care of the 3 orphans much to her chagrin, Miss Price does an about face and wants to keep them after their short experiences together.  Miss Price goes to London to track down Professor Browne, who swindled her, yet in the matter of a day or so, there appears to be a romantic interest developing with no real chemistry visible.  It seemed a bit contrived.<br /><br />My wife and I both feel asleep half way through the movie.  We resumed watching it on a second nite.  My 9 year old daughter thought it was so-so.<br /><br />Visual effects were great considering it was the pre-CGI era.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this application it's not a rip off and with the new Amazon coins I got it for free it was totally worth it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show.  Can be real creepy, which is good!  Each show gets resolved in that episode.  They do have an underlying plot that comes in about every 2 weeks or so.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love it! get it,boys! you get to breed your own dragons, but they don t die. their Max level is 15.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is bitsurprisingly challenging and a lot of fun.  I like that you need to strategically choose your purchases and then the game changes because of your choice
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is nice for mornings when u need to take a break or even when you are a mad because it is funny and it gets your brain working
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this entangling story of an amnesia patient working diligently to recover her past. Great ending! I did want to know how her next morning went....
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I'm 12 and a girl and lol I just love but it does need a little while to download extra stuff but it's totally worth it!!!! :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book very quickly.  Didn't want to put it down.  The story certainly kept your interest.  I didn't know much about this type of mental problem.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|At Christmas-time we like to stuff stockings with little odds & ends including techie gadgets, movies, music CDs and such... A few years ago I gave this 'movie' to myself as a stocking-stuffer gift, having watched the original airing of the series, and we have watched it twice again since then.<br /><br />Amazingly acted by all, especially by the main actors Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney, this is a realistic view of people's lives at the time -- not a blustery, pretty, feel-good glorification of the revolutionary events that shaped our country.<br /><br />Since our original purchase we have given this as a gift to parents, grandparents and in-laws, with excellent reviews and thank-yous from all. If you are a fan of history or just a fan of well told and well acted stories, then we highly recommend this series.<br /><br />Excellent. Recommended.
B00BYISQTO|2.0|I like the band's music, but the sound of each new record is worse than the last. Trouble Will Find Me is coarse, grating, and irritating. I bought the CD, but I doubt the LP would be any better, it's almost definitely the mix that's at fault.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|At Christmas-time we like to stuff our kids' stockings with little odds & ends including techie gadgets, movies, music CDs and such...  A few years ago, when Taylor Swift first moved onto the charts, she was one of the singers whose songs moved to the top of our teen daughter's playlist.  We purchased this 'album' for our daughter and it was a big stocking-stuffer hit.<br /><br />Since then, access to the Amazon Music Cloud has been a gigantic bonus for us all!  This set of songs, along with every other CD or MP3 download that we have purchased from Amazon since like 1999, has become available to be uploaded to the Cloud -- and we have taken full advantage of that opportunity.<br /><br />Now we can access this set of music and all the other music we have purchased from anywhere we have 'net access. Just outstanding!<br /><br />If you are a fan of this music, then we highly recommend this 'album' and the Amazon Music Cloud service to all. Excellent.
B00C7O8MJ8|1.0|This is what happens when you let a TV composer do film. Sure, TV composers can be too good for average tv composition and move on to film. This isn't one of them. This is as common as \\"classic\\" sounding action scores can get. There is nothing to contrast this from average background music. His \\"theme,\\" if you can call it that, is barely even a full riff let alone an actual theme. The actual Star Trek theme is so bold and yet its not even hinted at. There are so many composers that could have done something interesting with this and still be in the realm of classic composition for a fun action romp. There's Steve Jablonsky, David Arnold, Bear McCreary, Clinton Shorter, Thomas Newman, Cliff Martinez, Harry Gregson Williams (if he's having an \\"on\\" day like he was during the Metal Gear series) and I would have loved to have seen what would happen if Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori were given a crack at Star Trek...<br /><br />There are just so many composers who can do the classic orchestra thing without sounding like some muddled amateur riffing off the likes of John Williams and Alan Silvestri (back when they were still on their game). Even James Horner evolved with the times and killed it on his Amazing Spider-man score, which was both classic and beautiful while forward thinking and interesting (which by the way, Giacchino totally lifts for the intro chimes on the track \\"Star Trek Theme\\" which, spoiler alert, isn't ACTUALLY even the Star Trek theme itself until the last, I kid you not, 17 seconds... unforgivable).<br /><br />This is just what someone would play over an episode of Epic Meal Time... and probably not even then. Its playing epic rather than BEING epic. Star Trek deserves a lot better... and that's from a casual fan. I can't even imagine how annoyed the die hards must be.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is NOT a &#34;how to&#34; book, but gives some very good insight into the subculture of &#34;memory athletes&#34; and some interesting side notes on savants including &#34;Kim&#34; from Rain Man.  I enjoyed it very much
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|All the positive reviews here are true, I was a little concerned that this one would veer off into more parallels like the 2009 reboot, however, J.J. Abrams has kept the integrity of the TOS & the 80's films intact, some liberties were taken with the Klingons, but not by much, if you have seen \\"Enterprise's\\" 4th season, then the Klingon's appearance won't be too surprising, there isn't much I can say that others haven't already said, except to say that everyone portrays these classic characters to perfection, Leonard Nimoy's cameo was great, Alice Eve definately looks like a younger Carol Marcus no doubt, Benedict Cumbarach definately has a famous villian's mannerism down, Karl Urban definately reminds you of McCoy, & Kirk & Spock are in perfect form, I was convinced this time that Chris Pine was a younger William Shatner, the brash charm was there, I was a bit disappointed that him & Carol Marcus didn't flirt more, after all they are destined to be lovers & the parents of David as seen in \\"Star Trek II-Wrath of Kahn\\", but then again the pacing of this one didn't allow a romance to blossom, even though it is an alternate reality, the attraction would still be there, overall, this one I think is the best one since \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", maybe even better, somthing I thought I would never hear myself say, despite being an alternate reality, the ending defiantely seems to predate elements of the 60's show & 80's films as if there is no alternate reality, which surprised me, overall, this one is one of the best \\"Trek\\" films ever made.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An immaculate piece of work.  The writing is precise, and never too much.  The emotion is always there, and it perfectly evokes a period in history that is critical to our modern world.
B003PNF4D2|3.0|Sweet film, made for a nice simple evening with the lady. I don't think anyone misses out by not seeing it, but it certainly won't feel like a waste of time.
B00CRW2066|5.0|This band is a treasure.  I love how upon repeated listening one hears different things on each song.  I know a lot of people will not &#34;get&#34; this band or their sound; that's OK - they never will, which is their loss.
B002APU580|5.0|I loved the movie.  It's a lot different from the one with Coiin Firth and much faster paced.  I still like it though.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|The music, story line, actors, setting, over the top characters, love story, scenery, its all good.  Dirty Dancing is a classic and will always be enjoyed.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|An epic tail that really pushed the boundaries of story telling. It's just worth watching alone by this unique factor.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|At first I didn't think I'd like it and decided to watch just for the costumes and old houses, but the characters and story line grew on me in the first 15, 20 minutes and I was happy to watch at the end.  It didn't all take place in palacial English country castles, which was interesting and the mixing of levels of society was also interesting, especially how sisters could be so different when it comes to acceptance of the different levels of society.  Although the settings were lovely and the clothes and costumes enchanting, overall it reminded me that I'm glad to live in the 21st century.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is difficult to read, especially if you're from the South.  But it is so well written, with such compelling characters that I couldn't put it down. When I had to, like to sleep, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The story consumed me!  It is intense and wonderful. I highly recommend it.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Very fun.  I liked it back on iOS and its just as good on my android.  A must download for people who like puzzle games.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a very fun game that both me and my family enjoy. Very addicting and one of the best apps I have on my device
B004TI5N38|5.0|I just began reading David Baldacci and I love all his books.  The stories are very interesting and I will continue buying his books.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love that this game is very kid friendly and I even enjoy playing myself. The background music is very soothing, and the colors are very pleasing to the eyes.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|The fact that I loved the film and the score was enhanced when I saw that M83 did the music.<br />I got turned on to them in the past year and whomever they are, they know how to make souring music.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great way to pass time while being laid up with a bad back. I love the game so very much.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|Groundhog Day could be considered a simple comedy, in my opioion, the best Bill Murray has ever done. But, for me, it represents much more, the challenge to overcome one's ego and become a loving person. Groundhog Day illustrates this by forcing Bill Murray to relive the same day, over and over, until he gets it &#34;right&#34;, earning the love of costar Andie MacDowell. This is what happens if one believes in reincarnation, correct? We have to live our life over and over, until we learn how to do it right. Unlike goofball comedies like Ghostbuters and Caddyshack for which Bill Murray is famous, Groundhog Day (and Scrooged) can be watched as a movie or enjoyed as a movie with a lesson to teach. My wife and I watch this movie every year and I just purchased an online version to share with a brother who is dying from ALS. He had never seen it, loved it, and it put a smile on his face. Thanks to Amazon for making movies available online, I was halfway across the country from my movie collection and Groundhog Day is not available on Netflix. ENJOY!!!
B00CP2Z5TC|2.0|There is no spark here. Their first two albums were light and fun; this album is neither and it doesn't have much in the way of interesting substitutes. It feels to me like they were pushed to release a new album and did so when they didn't really have much worth releasing.<br /><br />Remember when the Strokes put out two amazing albums then when you bought the third one you asked yourself, \\"what is this?\\" You'll get the same feeling when to buy the third Vampire Weekend album.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Simply one of the greatest movies of all time. Amazing story telling. Great acting. Good character development. Hollywood makes too few movies of this caliber.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I've seen all the seasons (excluding 4 since its not on Prime yet)  9-12 times. Instead of children's shows my son loves the songs dancing and always the \\"dah-dahs\\" at the end. Very enjoyable show! Something I can endure and ie grown to be a GLEEK
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is truly an amazing app to use if your Kindle is lagging. It improves memory and response time. Give it a try! It's free!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Always great...even the second time around.<br />Exciting and action packed with a little romance mixed in.<br />Great historical details....read and enjoy
B009GX6SSK|5.0|what can i say and i just cant wait what happen next year and for romance they kiss and i just dont like in the end. i am rooting for deeks and kensi!!!!
B0036UMM84|5.0|As dated as this movie is it is a classic.  Kris Kristofferson is brilliant as a burned out rocker and even more so in love with Streisand.  They both were truly entertaining.  I loved it when I saw it in the movies and love it now.  Streisand over acts, but that is all part of the charm and fun of this movie.  I gave it 5 stars........
B000F8O35U|5.0|24 is one of the best television series that I have watched in a long time.  Bring more like it.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I love this movie for many reasons. It has a combination of science fiction and romance and comedy...  Wish they had put together a follow-up... (Kate & Leopold part 2)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is kinda simple for adults but still fun<br />but my 4 year old loves it and I like that she is learning problem solving while playing
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enough action to hold my attention with enough twists to make one want to pick up the third book. Very entertaining.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm able to watch in HD with zero problems using my PS3.  This is so much better than having to wait for it to come out in blu ray.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|I can see how someone would not enjoy. However, as a music lover, I gave this a chance. Think it's brilliant. Once drawn in, there's nothing like it.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Maybe the younger players can follow the rapid screen movements, or maybe I've mellow just enough to realize that we 65+ year old gamesters need games that can slow the action down to a manageable pace. By contrast, I enjoy DH3 and play it often.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this game is fun at first but it quickly becomes repetitive and boring simply because of the repeat gameplay. Good for waiting in line but only if your wait is a short one.
B000FC1LOC|1.0|I really did not like anything about this book, and I don't think I have felt that way about a book in a long time.  None of the characters were really likeable.
0316069485|5.0|He captivates you from start to finish in his stories of the aw by an unusual lawyer practicing it daily.
B002QYSZBO|4.0|Very clever many twists enjoyable romp with Robert Downey Jrs Ever witty ,charming character and Val Kilmer In a fun different character roll
0446195529|5.0|David leads you from the introduction through the progress of events in a way that holds your interest in the outcome of events.
B003UYUP58|4.0|So first off: it's a great book and you should read it. But the writing style does get a bit tiring after a while.<br /><br />Are you familiar with those pop psychology books that try to explain everything through a series of anecdotes? It's exactly like that. Anecdotes, although they're from sometimes fifty or a hundred or two hundred years old, that are strangely embellished with details about wallpaper color, the lighting in various rooms, facial expressions. Every person somehow has a unique and quirky personality and Siddhartha seems to somehow have magically figured out their exact hopes and aspirations at any point in time.<br /><br />I appreciate the effort into making this book more than a dry scientific tome, but really, there's different ways to write about science and history, y'know.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Once again, David Baldacci takes the reader on an &#34;adventurous road&#34; that leads to an &#34;unexpected conclusion. This is a type of novel that piques the curiosity of the reader and asks: Write another - right on!
B009EE5SQ4|4.0|Good combination of special effects and a strong cast backed up with an interesting story line. I chose the HD version since I now have an HD flatscreen and it's a nice enhancement to an already good movies
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|When I first got this mouse I thought...OMG..I cannot control this thing! It's a fast mouse. But I tweaked it in the settings and it's much better. I went from a Microsoft Optical mouse to this one and it fits my hand well. I like larger mouses. The buttons are customizable, but I will admit to not using all of them. Colors are pretty if you're into that thing and yes, I'll admit it. I played with the colors. I didn't need the weights, this mouse has enough weight for me. Good value for the price, somewhat similar in weight and size to the Microsoft Optical mouse and great for gaming.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This was something we were going to pay to have someone do, but this made it really easy, and we could organize them as we went.  I have not put them in the computer yet, but hopefully it will be great.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|Classic Sci-fi film that says more today about youth and aging than it did in the 70's. Stiill a real vent movie. Great story and acting.
B0097JYVAU|3.0|Nate likes throwing in references to the classics. There were some really boring sections to be honest about Climate Change, and his Baseball models.<br /><br />What I would be interested in would be how Nate would go in a Mosteller 50 classical problems in probability as I think he reallly simplifies and show's a lack of appreciation failure of the math's such as Algebra and the type of common errors that can occur when just applying a simple formula.
B0016PM722|5.0|In well-lit areas, doesn't drop any jaws - but when the light is relatively low, this thing is awesome looking. Plan on getting more of the FX collection. I'm a grown man, and this almost makes me wanna bite the bullet and have a kid, just so I can have a reason to go trick-or-treating with them as a Jedi knight.
B006AX6ONI|1.0|Was there any mention of Broadcast.com or AudioNet. It mentioned very briefly his biography growing up but there was nothing in it that excited me or got me motivated.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|So I just bought the full version. Now I can't finish the puzzle because the item I need is under the back button. What kind of person puts an item behind a a back button? It's stupid I just wasted my money and the game was good otherwise. Very disappointing. It could have been great if they knew how to place things in puzzles. Wasted $1.50 on this. And I literally just paid for it too.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|The black man's voice did not do it for me as a narrative or story teller. He sounded way too white. I also found it slightly predictable.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The best book I've read in a very long time! ! The story keeps you interested and its hard to put the book down!!
B00130UFY2|5.0|A great ending, if that's what you'd call it, to the Bourne trilogy.  Wonderfully put together, great acting and direction, fast-paced score to match the action.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Love the series.  So happy to see it is on here.  Will be here awhile and watch all the series
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was actually a little disappointed with this novel.  It came highly recommended by several people and I was excited to read it.  Maybe I was too excited.  It took a long time to get interested in and I found the action slow going.  I did eventually finish it, and was happy with the story overall, but confused at the end!
0812550706|5.0|This is a classic that I had enjoyed before but lost my copy. As good as ever, more so the second time around!
B0084670FU|4.0|This is the kind of movie that requires your strictest attention otherwise, you will miss the storyline. It weaves together the stories of 4 different people who find themselves effected by the actions of each of the other 3 though they are separated by many thousands of miles. Quite simply the message is &#34;no man is an island&#34;. Good actors and a very good story wrapped in wonderful cinematography make this movie a &#34;must see&#34;.
0345404475|5.0|This is a classic that I had enjoyed before but lost my copy. As good as ever, more so the second time around!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I typically read chick-lit books and wanted to try a thriller type book.  I poked around on Amazon and came across this one.  Don't recall what I paid for it but I really liked it considering it's not my normal type of leisure reading.  There were times I was home alone reading at night and got creeped out a bit and found myself thinking &#34;did I just hear something&#34;.  Had to wait for my husband to get back.  Some reviewers complained about the main characters neurotic tendencies with the locks, etc.  She's being treated for a mental health disease and this is what folks with her problems do.  The author was simple showing us that in the novel.  I don't think she was trying to fill pages with the same stuff &#34;checked the locks, checked them again, checked the windows, checked them again&#34;.  She wanted us to truly understand how freaked out the main character was.  I liked the book and will definitely check out others by the author.  Thanks for a good read!
B0055PMJMW|3.0|This one just didn't appeal to me like some of the others.  Still well written but just not as interesting a back story  But if you like Hollywood mystery this one is for you
B005DC68NI|5.0|Read this over the course of two days while on vacation.  Stumbled upon it at Amazon---don't recall the price but I've always been intrigued by writing a novel and never realized you can, with today's technology, and self publish.  I know I'm not the world's next greatest author waiting to be picked up by some world know agent and publishing house.  I'm just me, with a few stories to tell, and now have a way to get them out and check an item off my bucket list.  David's book had lots of good info, especially for someone walking in cold.  I highlighted a bunch of passages while reading on my Kindle.  I plan to go back with a pad of paper and take more notes.  I loved section three with the short interviews given by 33 other self-published authors.  That was priceless.  Again, lots of great information, and easy to read.  It's nice to find someone who wants to SHARE information with others, in hopes they can succeed too, as opposed to coveting information.  I might even check out one of his short stories and/or novel too.  Thanks for an informative read!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Written in the style of all good mysteries with character you can relate to and have seen in your own travels.  Once I found this author I started reading everything I could find having grown in in Los Angeles they all reminded me of places I had been and stories I had read in the newspapers in times gone by.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Again, a fabulous story that draws you in and makes you feel connected to this wonderous country and its people.Right from the first few pages I knew that I would spend many late nights .Thank you Khaled for making me fall in love with fictional characters and not wanting the book to end.....
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Everyone has written about the performances in this movie, I wanted to touch on the extras. You get two physical copies of this movie, (1 dvd and 1 bluray). You also get to have an instant streaming copy thru ultraviolet which has the option of choosing Amazon Instant Video, which I did so you can watch the movie on your Kindle Fire HD or computer or any device that has access to Amazon. You can also choose to download the movie to your device if you will be outside of wifi areas.<br />I love this!<br /><br />Now I will never be without this great movie!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Superb special effects, great story, familiar faces and unmistakable honor and patriotism melded together to present a real mind trip which was over all too soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This fame is highly addictive.  Works exceptionally well.  Don't like ads but can't complain about that since it's free!  Thank you
B007IK44CK|4.0|This one had wild special effects and a good story line. It was cast well and maintained a sense of action and intrigue throughout.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Awesome read! Unexpected reading that exploded all senses. I will surely read more extraordinary books by Moning in the future.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Amazing that a show like this can still find new and interesting stories!  Good energy throughout!  Relevant to the times!
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This was the worst of the Paranormal Activity movies so far. I should have known better don't waste your time or hard earned money rent The Collection instead.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|I like the show.  The writing is quite good.  I like the use of new technology.  I just wish that it was a little less violent.  It seems like not an episode goes by without at least ten people getting shot to death!  At least they are all bad guys ... i guess...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Our whole family loves and watches this series together. It has a lot of different characters and were always excited to see who is going to come in next.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|And the moral of the story is...? This film makes a very good story for every kid and every kid in us. The casting is brilliant! For Beetlejuice fans, Catherine O'Hara is up to her old tricks. Christina Ricci is a charm and James McAvoy is Prince Charming in a down to earth world. The other characters are wonderfully funny, making this film a must see. For Tim Burton fans, this one is really close to that same artistic style! My only confusion was the odd mix of British and American English accents making it truly a land of fantasy. What really threw me off was McAvoy's American English accent. Personally, I would have preferred his natural Scottish over American English. Still, I give it 5 stars!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Great app for calendar and Checklist programs. Easy to work with and diffrent views works great. Can't beat the price.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this app for my 8 year old so she can learn to help the horses and i think i like playing it too. Lol easier clean up than the real ones we have.!
B007SGM084|3.0|it was to slow getting to the story and it keep saying the same things over and over. it was just about a guy who wanted to dominate a woman to be supmissive to his need only.
B0054XOMX4|4.0|It is a good bey l agree, but it isn't the best one because it can easily beaten by Duo Uranus 230 WD. It is because of the bearing drive bottom that makes it lose to a higher spin track like 230. It is a good bet but certainly not the best.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game  starts slow, but then you are going to love it. My friend  recommended it and I recommend it too.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|game does not challenge you it is more like and action solitare. Not a game i want to play often.
B00992CF6W|4.0|A great game that is so fun and ADDICTIVE. This game is great to play with pals but a tad glitchy. Everything else works fine for me. You can even get ES file explorer and download others maps and mods. This game is brilliant. Now time for the reason I gave it 4 stars. This game is glitchy while online. Otherwise it's fine. This game is also very very new and not so full of content. It has small worlds and a lack of blocks and other enhancements like the nether and the end. Warning. This game never ends. You build and build.<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Quality: 5<br />Content 3.5<br />Textures: 4<br />Total 12.5/15
B0015S1Q0O|5.0|I'm by no means an expert on Beethoven, or any composer, but this is my favourite rendition of Beethoven's works. I've owned the vinyl version for many years, so I've come to view this as the standard by which others are judged by. Perhaps it's a tad slow for some, but I love it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This was a great book. I loved it so much. I can't wait to read the next ones. Best Book ever!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I wanted to check out this book because of the positive reviews it received. I was not disappointed. This book will make you laugh out loud. I loved how the author really pulls into Drew's world. Can't wait for the next book to come out. Very enjoyable read.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I say that because I didn't want the game to end. They really could have made it longer... it could have gone on for a while longer. Maybe even mix it up a little with some new symbols and tiles... better monsters... more bosses, etc. There's a lot that can be done to make this game even better-- but it already is great and worth 5 stars. I just hope they keep adding more content to it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is wonderful! It is a basic calculator with basic functions. It also has a back button that actually works! I use it on my Kindle Fire which makes for a large display with large buttons. It is a great learning tool for children.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game must go down in history as one of the most classic games of all time. It is brilliant in every way. It is flawless. I just can't say enough good things about it. I've been playing it for years and I just can't get sick of it. I am glad that it made it to the Android platform. And of course I bought it here, too. I do enjoy the PC version the best because I like playing it with a mouse but it still is real good on Android and worth 5 stars.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Got hooked watching season 1 and 2 thru on demand - had to have season 3 and cannot wait for season 4!  Great casting and dresses!!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Some box sets are cutely designed and full of extras that end up taking precious living space.  Not this baby!  Are you just interested in thin DVD jewel cases wrapped in a equally thin box?  Then this is your set.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|There's nothing not to like here.  I keep a small case of CDs to carry in car.  Listening here certainly beats down the tedium of Houston traffic, makes those slow to a crawl episodes on the freeway almost - but only almost - appreciated, since they provide opportunity to listen to more.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kind of a brutal &#34;24&#34; experience.  Gripping, violent, surprising,but very well acted and cast.  Kevin Bacon is superb.  Once you start, you can't stop.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It seemed to repeat in places.  It tended to drag in some of the chapters as well.  Other than that is was good.
B004J4WL50|5.0|This is such a compelling business concept - so simple to understand but so meaningful to everyone involved.  I look forward to seeing where Blake and his team go next with the one for one model.  I am sure that this story will inspire many to seek their own path to a successful and meaningful business.
0810989956|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS AS PART OF A SERIES FOR MY GRANDSONS.  THEY LOVE THE BOOK AND IT ENCOURAGES THEM TO READ.  THEN THEY PASS THE BOOK DOWN TO THE NEXT IN LINE WHOM CAN READ...AN INVALUABLE GIFT.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Loved this book. So well written. Not my usual type of read but such an insight<br /> into India in the eighties.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|This is a great read for anyone that works with people.  It gets one thinking about leading through inspiration rather than persuasion, or worse coercion.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A lot of characters to keep track of, but just a great read!  Kite runner is still my favorite so far.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I highly recommend this movie if you are both a fan of Marvel comics and clean family movies. Yes it does have violence in it but it is still a good wholesome movie with a great story line and action.
B001224WBS|5.0|I've always liked Depeche Mode tunes. This CD is all their great songs. I could listen to these guys every day.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Robert Downey Jr need I say more....his portrayal of Tony Stark in all the Iron man movies is for me the best ever! This movies which combines certain Marvel characters into the Avengers is just awesome.  I do recommend this if you are at all a fan of any Marvel movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This one took a little more maneuvering than the other one in that there's more hand activitity.  Its actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Pretty good movie, but as it goes on it gets a bit silly in the plot.  Acting was well done I thought, and there were some very amusing parts in the film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it!  Cannot wait for the next season to start.  Quick shipping as always from Amazon.  Definitely recommend if you missed this season!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Fun game to play when I am suppose to be working and a great game for kids to keep them occupied.<br />I have told many people of this app for kindle fire and friends have also downloaded Booty Quest.<br />outplay entertainment has some fun games I will continue to download their games.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|This movie stands the test of time...65 million years worth. It changed our perception of CGI and opened up a whole new realm of story-telling. Jeff Goldbloom delivers some of the movie's great philosophical dialog with a perfect balance of humor. Sam Neill delivers a perfect blend of awkward scientist and reluctant hero.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|How can I give both \\"Guilt Trip\\" and \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" 3 stars?  Because I think \\"Guilt Trip\\" mostly succeeds in what it sets out to be: A somewhat comedic portrayal of a mother/son relationship that isn't really dysfunctional -- rather the characters are grappling with their own issues that unsurprisingly get resolved during a road trip they take from New Jersey (where mom lives) to California (where son lives).<br /><br />The movie doesn't suffer from pretentiousness; if anything, it aims a little too low.  There are some serious moments when Barbra Streisand's sort of stereotypical, overbearing mother character, Joyce, gets too much in her son's business.  But of course, it's all for his own good.  There's no maliciousness here -- the relationship between Andy (Seth Rogen) and Joyce is actually quite sweet.  Andy's father died when he was 8 and in terms of intimate relationships, they have pretty much been alone in the world together.  Even from thousands of miles away, Joyce can be rather obsessive in terms of her devotion to her only child, who doesn't reciprocate in a way that makes her confident in their intimacy.  The road trip solves all that. (If you consider that last line a spoiler, you shouldn't watch this movie.)<br /><br />It's revealed early on that Andy is named after Joyce's first true love, and that becomes a centerpiece of the movie that I didn't expect.  The focus of the story is definitely on Joyce and settling her into a better middle-age than her rather boring lifestyle is currently affording her.  The mother/son relationship is never really tattered or in danger...Joyce's nagging of Andy is constant, but fairly amusing.  And frankly, the movie never gets that deep.  These are two people who are a little lost in their lives, who happen to be mother in son.  Joyce lives like a nun, and Andy is struggling to fulfill his career ambitions.  They help each other get over their respective humps during this cross-country trip during which Andy is trying to sell an organic cleaning product he's created. They're two funny people.  That's pretty much it.<br /><br />There are a couple of poignant moments if you can allow yourself to get wrapped up enough in the movie to appreciate them.  The acting is good given how little meat is in the script -- but I was very aware that I was watching two people who were acting like mother and son.  Honestly, in terms of \\"recent\\" movies, I enjoyed watching Ms. Streisand play the character of Roz Focker in \\"Meet the Fockers\\" more than I did watching her play a fuddy duddy housewife in this vehicle.  Joyce seems more like a grandmother than a mother.  But that's from where much of the humor is derived, and I did laugh a few times, which is what I wanted.  And although it isn't Oscar material, I wasn't insulted by \\"Guilt Trip\\" either.  It's a nice movie.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|It is a fun and whimsical story that captures the imagination and brings you into a world just beyond the...well...train tracks. Teen angst,  magic, mayhem and some very interesting characters round out this first installment in the very popular series. We Muggles can enjoy a place we were never meant to see...
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Great series, entertaining and well structured, nicely paced and very addictive, flawed but interesting characters. Larsson and Salander will be sorely missed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A big fan of the Walking dead and this season was great. The social angst, the &#34;realism&#34; of the post mankind scenario and of course Walkers (zombies for the uninitiated) all make for great television. The show constantly, through good story-telling, asks the questions &#34;what would you do?&#34; and &#34;how far would you go?&#34;. The psychology of the series is as important as the the Walkers, but let's face it...we all love zombies.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I love having all the special features! The quality is amazing too. Of course I'll be watching this every day.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I think it was a really good movie. It made sense, everything was explained unlike some movies where you have to guess what is going on half the time. It did have its rough moments but it was overall a fantastic movie.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love this show, my new obsession! The actors and actresses are very good, and very attractive. That always helps.The stories and characters are interesting and I can't wait to see what happens. I hope they go on for several more seasons. I really enjoy this show.
386521584X|1.0|Change the title to \\"The Bigots\\" and I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />RF is a great or a near great photographer, and, if it had a different title this work would be a near-great photo book. It's use of sequencing of unposed photos is a tour de force and important in the history of photography.<br /><br />Is it as great as the mind-blowing multi-leveled sequencing in Homer's Iliad created 3,000 year ago?  Let's be serious, children.  There is great art and mind-blowing, unimaginable, enduring and seminal great art.  RF is very far from the latter.<br /><br />As an avid street photographer in my retirement (www.sidewakshadows.com), I am forced to think about American society and how it presents itself every day.  And I'm old enough remember the 50's well, and how we intellectuals preened about its failings.  As a personal statement by a typical alienated, deracinated European snob, the book is excellent.  He presents his biased and unloving personal vision very well.  That would be worth 5 stars.<br /><br />Please remember that this selection was edited down from over 18,000 images he took on his fellowship. People who have compared the selection to the other photos he rejected have noted the profoundly negative bias in the selection, and how unrepresentative the photos selected were of the the photos taken.  People who have tried to retrace his steps and take similar images have also been defeated in their quest, since the people they found were so friendly and smiling.  Put simply, the man was a European bigot who hated us for thriving while Europe went down in flames.  He was not alone, by any means.  For every PG Wodehouse who dug American culture, there were 100 Europeans who felt distressed by our love of the common man and his aspirations.<br /><br />So what is documented in The Americans is not really America, but a nasty, narrow view of America that was shared by many Europeans and also American intellectuals and artists.  The initial reviews in the US were all negative, not because the reviewers did not understand photography, but because as contemporaries, they understood RF's intent and shortcomings.<br /><br />As I said, as a teenager I shared some of this prejudice against American prosperity and culture.  Then I grew up.<br /><br />The book is a fine book, if you just change the title to The Bigots -how angry foreigners thought of our country.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I always heard of the show but never gave it a chance. Once I tried being open minded, I fell in love with the show.<br />If enjoy drama, musicals with popular artists and high school related themes and a teacher who's arrogance is so off the top it's funny. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs something to laugh  and possibly cry about.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I swear I didn't write this review under influence of The Prayer by Josh Groban and this book<br /><br />Let's start with a rainy night. I entered the usual pub. The bartender threw me his bartender smile<br /><br />Me: (sliding into the usual spot) give me one glass of sci-fi<br /><br />Him: yes sir, what flavor do you want?<br /><br />Me: I don't know, I want something new, fresh, slightly sweet. Surprise me.<br /><br />Him: do you want to try our new batch of dystopia??? they just came in.<br /><br />Me: No, no no, I'm sick of them. Why in the world that every single new YA sci-fi has to be Dystopia? Can't you make something else? Space Opera? Planetary romance? Cyberpunk?<br /><br />Him: sorry sir. That belongs to the 80s adult section. However, I can give you a usual dose of Ender's Game.<br /><br />Me: nah, I had it for the last 27 years. Something else please.<br /><br />Him: but you are only 26<br /><br />Me: whatever, how about fantasy?<br /><br />Him: oh yes, I can surely offer a glass of paranormal romance<br /><br />Me: I already told you those stuffs make me nauseated. How about this? Make me a drink, sci-fi and fantasy, a little sweet, and don't you dare forget a dash of cyborg, shaken, not stirred.<br /><br />Him: yes sir, hold on a sec<br /><br />He poured me a glass of Cinder<br /><br />Me: wait, what is this? Cider?<br /><br />Him: No, Cinder, sir.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is kinda a fresh wind passed by after a hot day. I can't tell you how much I hate the current YA sci-fi trend. Cinder grabbed my attention because it actually has some aspect of science, not the kind of pseudo stupid \\"science\\" other books have. Do I need to say I'm male? I have read stuffs much heavier than this. Nothing here is shockingly new. I already know the \\"twist\\" when the author mention the princess. So the big reveal in the end is not really big.<br /><br />But predictability doesn't make the book bad. There are still some moments I actually like. I like the romancebetween Kai and Cinder. It's not truly insta love like other books in this whole dystopia fad. Cinder is a strong protagonist. A female protagonist doesn't need to be kicking-butt, she just need to be independence, and Cinder fills that roles just fine. Beside, the author is good at writing. Her narrative is clear and straight to the point. Her world building skill is also top notch. I like the way she describe futuristic Beijing and its people. But I kinda wince by the fact that it has a mixture of different names like Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. I would expect the ruler of China has some names like Wei, Fang, Jing, etc, not Kaito.<br /><br />So, I like this book. It has some sweet moments, good protagonist, and the big bad. However, I have to remove one star because I hate cliffhanger ending. Five star means it's a prefect book, and I don't give it out often, even to my childhood favorite. The book can totally conclude right here, but I guess the author wanted to expand this universe a bit. Also, there are some plot holes (for some reasons, when the author describe Levana's army, I keep thinking about monkeys. I snort at her pitiful army. The number of tanks on Earth alone can crush those gun-welding monkeys in seconds). But it's fine. I didn't really expect a lot anyway. When I read about Galactic conflict, I want space battle, particle guns blaring, missiles whistling, etc. Last: ( I don't say about this book in particular, but to many books out there), the line between good and evil is too clear. I want a book that makes me think about the motivation of the villain. Levana is bad. Ok, but WHY? I know she wants war, it's not like every single villain in fantasy books, right? (Sarcasm mod on) Give me more insights about her motivation. What would she benefit from it rather than co-existing in peace. I guess I will never see something like that in this series. But I root for Cinder. Her adventure keeps my eyes glued to the pages. What else do I need? Galactic domination?<br /><br />Nah<br /><br />Overall, a solid good effort<br /><br />Now if you will excuse me, I have to go wrestle a bear to regain my manliness.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game so much it kind of like having a real horse. I love playing it so much, it is way to much fun.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love all the characters and the suspense. Juliane is so great and so is the female investigator. Awesome show.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|There were things I never saw coming...great read! I couldn't put it down. Great book that will hold your interest throughout!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I started to read and I didn't stop untill I finished the book. Nice easy read and quite informative. I had only heard Tesla's name before but I had no idea of his life story. Shame that in 2013 and we pay for Diesel and destroy our environment when by now we could all have had electric cars. F...ing rich politicians that want us to just get by. Thanks:)
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I love this movie almost as much as my son does! I had never preordered anything through amazon, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much amazon keeps you updated with your purchase!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I normally don't review every book I read, only the ones I love. This book is from the Male point of view. And. I. Love. Drew. This was such a refreshing change of pace from what I normally read, romance, all kinds of romance, alpha male, heroines POV kind of thing that I can't even tell you how much I loved it! I totally adored, laughed out loud literally, and I am really, really hoping there's not and end to this story... Ladies and gentlemen I highly recommend reading Tangle!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this album! I am really glad I gAve this one a shot! Bruno mars does not disappoint with ts one!
B0044IABFS|4.0|Very good series sad that it ended that way. Prison break keep u glued to your seat wanting more and more.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great, fast shipping! Got it on the day I was supposed to. I love to movie, and I really enjoy being able to watch it whenever I want!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This movie came as described. Any lover of Steven Speilberg will love this movie!<br /><br />The plot was a bit predictable, but the character development and subplots made it a movie that can be watched several times. The bonus features were high quality and not like the low quality ones too many movies are doing nowadays.<br /><br />The actors were mostly inexperienced, but in a way, it contributed to the movie (they are making a movie within the movie, and I felt their lack of major experience made it seem more real).<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and urge anyone who has not done so to watch it.
B001JU4S44|5.0|Looking forward to MI5 if it ever comes out. Just plain fun watching these movies...so get you popcorn and get ready for a exciting ride.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While the quality of the video devilered is satisfactory, the movie itself does not live up to the book completely. Nevertheless, if you liked the Hunger Games, you will enjoy this movie.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Non-stop excitement. Well crafted story with a mix of veteran and newcomer actors who keep me on the edge my seat.<br /><br />Sure wish I could fly with Firefly.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love a good book, especially one that makes me cry from laughing! This book had me hooked from the first page! I read this book in a day...couldn't put it down. You will not be disappointed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun quick game. It is easy. So that would be enough for me. I hate having to say so much.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|This is a test against the timer game and I am not normally a person that enjoys that, but this one has captured my attention for sure. Fantastic game, doesn't freeze and it is quite a challenge the further you go. I would definitely recommend this game!
0439023521|5.0|I've read all three of the books. This particular book probably took me two days to finish. A great read. I highly recommend this book.
B004TI1WME|3.0|Great app, I will definitely use this often. I only wish the numbers were a bit larger. Try it out.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  This is a wonderful series.  I can't wait for the next (6 & 7) books to be released.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I can add fractions, but it seems like the older I get I just sit and second guess myself, this is a great app to help me with that!!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Loved this movie. The stunts in it were awesome and some seemed more real to life. Most movies when they jump or wreak a car everyone hits their marks perfectly. I liked this one because they did not always have a perfect landing. Characters actually missed once in a while which made the stunts seem more realistic. Great action and humor. Best one yet.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Nice concept. Easy control. Very addictive. How do I edit my profile pic and name?<br />Need a little bit more info.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a junior high English teacher and I can't wait to read this with my 8th graders! John Green is one of those authors that can remind you why you love to read.
B000089RVX|5.0|You might have already heard all about how awesome this album is and how the band that made it is amazing, but to think i was enjoying the album 5-6 times in a row, that shows how great it is, just buy it, especially if you like REAL MUSIC:)
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great movie.  Has hilarious parts to it, and its a good movie to watch with a boyfriend or girlfriend on a date.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|With the large numbers and function keys, this calculator beats the smaller versions hands down!  I won't be using any other version now that I have this app.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Let me go out on a limb here and just say 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is just as good as the 2009 reboot, and dare I say; a tad better! You need not be a lifelong fan to enjoy this spectacular roller coaster ride of a movie but if you are, you will enjoy it... O-SO-MUCH-BETTER! The inferences & nods to past TV episodes & the early movies of the 80's are in of themselves so richly rewarding. You will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing, as the originality of the story keeps that 'alternate reality' concept going. This film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long, long time. It is thoroughly entertaining. The audience I saw it with stood up and clapped. When was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater? As previously stated 'STID' propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well. The friendship dynamic between Spock & Kirk is further developed in a really great, dramatic way. Some reviewers poo-pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired & predictable. However, as a Star Trek fan, isn't that what we've come to expect? In fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if Scotty & McCoy did not behave accordingly. A major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming. That's all I'll say on that or I'll have to be indited for being a huge spoiler. There are a ton of special F/X but they are done well and are not over bearing, in fact they add & give the movie it's richness. I met Gene Roddenberry when I was in college and was in awe of the man. I know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain-child. Kudos to J.J. Abrams, Kurtzman & Orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story & the characters who inhabit the world of Star Trek. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto shine. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly one of the best villains to comealong in years. His malevolence & charm are a wonder to behold.  If you breathe, have a heart, enjoy fantastic movie making at it's best, this is the movie for you & the whole family. This definitely is a return visit movie & then maybe even another return after that. Can't wait for the DVD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This digital version of the Bible is so easy to use!  I love that I can read a passage and simply change translation version to view another take on the same verses.  It is like carrying a stack of Bibles around without the juggling involved!  A definite 5 star app!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This was such a disappoint. The movie was so boring and so hard to get into because of the dialogue was difficult to follow the story line. Don't waste your money.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This makes running a search simpler than ever.  No intermediate steps to reach the search engine ~ you're just right there!  I'm enjoying having this at my fingertips.  Used it last night to check our weather since we had storms building in the vicinity.  Quick and easy.  Just what I needed.
1416524800|5.0|Kept my interest so much I could not put it down ... probably read this book quicker than any other i have read.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|If you're a fan of the Blokish board game, this game is it, the AI is pretty good and it applies all the rules automatically. I didn't like the lackluster presentation, it's pretty ugly for a 2013 game. I personally played for 20 minutes, and couldn't see myself getting into the deeper aspects of the strategy involved so I uninstalled it. Functional, challenging, and accurate, I'm just not personally a fan of Blokish.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This is a GREAT compilation of stories - perfect when you can read for a while, but may need to finish rather quickly ... not like a long novel - this has several somewhat separated stories
B0097K21YW|2.0|Samsung S4, plenty of processing power, but the game feels really sluggish. It's basically a clone of a game that rhymes with Dandy Herds, but with poorer controls and lag time waiting for the frivolous animations to play out. Uninstalled after a few minutes, might be fun for kids, but I didn't find any enjoyment here personally.
0812982622|5.0|Blood and gore and horror and starvation and Alice down the Rabbit Hole except that death and destruction await the citizen who dares think or feel hunger on his endless journey of hatred.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|this show is incredible; I can't seem to get enough. the acting is great, the writing is great, the characters are well-developed. I don't personally have anything that I don't like about this show. AMC did a great and extremely successful adaptation of the comics and I appreciate that they are not following the comic storyline but are taking the show in another direction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much. My friend told me that if you type Herobrine in the second box and you search the entire world you'll find Herobrine. I still have no proof yet.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Love to listen while working, great background music while working.  All the artists have done a great job on the original recordings, makes you want to watch your favorite movies again and again
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady GaGa rocks. This is one of the best albums I've listened to in a few years. The albums been out for a while and is still great to hear.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is engaging, unique, and amazing! I can not wait till the next session to come out, si I can know what happens next.
B004TI1WME|5.0|My LG phone came with a built in calculator that had (+ - x & division). When I go food shopping and have to do percentages my phone could not do it easily. So this app really comes in handy. Has a percent key and memory. I know It's not high tech but it does the job for me. Easy to use.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Not only is this movie a great example of storytelling at its finest, but it is also a finely crafted tale of characters shaped by events, and people affected by those events long after the fact.<br />Rourke's and Robbin's performances are simply outstanding. What could easily have devolved into cardboard characterizations, flat and uninspiring, instead were brought into a complex and multidimensional form. The direction is tight, skillful in building suspense and never gives in to the obvious methods of imagery or symbolism. Those cyes are subtle and assume the audience is intelligent and observant.<br />This is not a movie that I would watch every six months or so. It is one that I would rather watch once every two or three years, just to get the full effect and impact of the experience.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app.  i can add to the list or take away - when I complete a project it lines through it.  I really like the ease of use too!
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Like it. Good for passing the time. The kids can even play it without difficulty! Defiantly recommended for a time passing game!
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I am only on cha Peter two, but so far I have begun using some of the techniques, mainly observation.
0937381888|5.0|This is the second book every brewer should own.  Homebrewing for Dummies is an excellent introductory text.  This book takes it to the next level.  For the brewer who wants to know more about the science of brewing, this is the book to buy.  Mr. Palmer does an excellent job of explaining what is going on during the entire brewing process.  His explanation of the all grain process is exceptionally well done and in great detail.  The back of the book even shows brewers how they can build their own brewing equipment and possibly save some money.  If you want to know more about brewing before investing in the hobby or if you have been brewing and want to learn more, this book is fantastic!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I love the new time-line and vision J.J. Abrams gave the Star Trek franchise. However, I'm bummed that Vulcan was destroyed.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well done, well written, a great true story of adversaries during World War 2.  Giving the German pilots views and experince was a look inside the German air force.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The angle with which ithe Kindle has to be held to take a picture! Very difficult to focus on the subject  and snap it at the same time.. Sorry I purchased it and, no, I would not recommend it to another.<br /><br />I strongly regret I did not stay with my first option and purchase the Ipad. I purchased the Kindal because of cost.

1936891026|5.0|At first you feel what the author talks about are pretty shallow and kind of boring. But as you go further especially those last pages. It becomes very inspiring and teaches you tons of stuff. amzing book
B004QK5N5W|5.0|excellent product. I commend you for your attention<br />so I will continue to work very well. thanks<br />thousand blessings to all
B0084HJE0S|4.0|I liked the way the author describes some basic concepts of HTML 5 and related technologies. The cons: sometimes It looked like if the author hates MS.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown uses words to make the reader feel the characters` experience. That was successful. The story was good, though it could have been a little shorter for my liking.  I enjoyed some of the history lessons but after awhile just wanted to get to the end.
1402786360|5.0|I love this book. It has taken my baking experience to the next level! The book came within 3 days and no problems with my order.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Skip this one and read her other two novels: Gone Girl & Sharp Objects.  They are much better.  Just couldn't really connect with Dark Places.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Let say you had a Philly guy, a regular Philly guy, a regular Philly guy from one of its Little Italy neighborhoods. You know a guy who would root himself hoarse at a Phillies' game, or for the Flyers, or the `76ers (forget U/Penn though) and would go absolutely bonkers (maybe I sure reserve the use of that would here), would get heated up a lot, okay, at an Eagles football game. A guy who would, maybe, know how to make use of a good buffalo wings recipe or the secrets of a good place to get a good cheese and steak submarine sandwich. See a regular Philly guy, okay. Regular except for a little, uh, mental problem, a bi-polar problem, a little problem that got to be a big problem when his ever-lovin' wife proved unfaithful to him, as some wives will, proved unfaith though maybe because he spent just a little too much time cheering on those sports teams and not enough time being, well, being a well-rounded modern man. And our regular Philly guy went a little overboard in reaction to that treachery and wound up in a mental institution, complete with \\"meds\\" to calm him down. Oh yah, and despite those quirky little characteristics he is a voracious reader, a cowboy intellectual (although perhaps I should also reserve the word cowboy as well). Either way keep that reader thing under your hat since \\"real\\" Philly guys are too busy to read.<br /><br />Let's say while our regular Philly guy, Pat to give him a name, was getting well (and not getting within shouting distance of his wife under penalty of another stretch, maybe some prison time the next time) and trying to make himself worthy of his wife's affections when she comes along. The she in question being another of the world's waif, Tiffany, who has her own set of, uh, mental problems but who came on board to try to get Pat through his rough spots on the road to reuniting with his wife.<br /><br />And let's say that Ms. Tiffany is, well, kind of screwy, kind of outdoes Pat in the screwy department. At least for a while.On the face of it one regular Philly guy (albeit with those little problems mentioned above), and one screwy Philly dame with her own set of high octane problems would be strictly oil and fire. No go, nada, get lost. Except she had a thing for regular Philly guys with problems, or for one Philly guy with problems. And so to lure the unsuspecting Pat in she, as part of an agreement to with him to contact his wife, bargains him into becoming her amateur night dancing partner. Just partners that's all. As it turns out, they aren't half bad after a ton of practice and a road strewn filled with pitfalls. See too, though as it turned out he developed a thing for regular (if screwy) Philly gals (or gal).<br /><br />Now let's say all this happened, plus a few odd-ball things around Pat's family issues, then you would have a very amusing and well-produced romantic comedy for the 21st century. Hey, I'll take the Eagles and three points, okay Pat. See this one, okay, even if you aren't a regular Philly guy or gal.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|It has been awhile since I read any of these tales but the ones in this book seem somewhat familiar but also seem new.
B00CL68BK2|1.0|Not really sure how I felt about this movie after watching it. These are two great actors that could've picked better roles to play...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun game you have to wait for more missions sometimes when you can't go any further.lots of upgrades for iron man.
B005HSL626|4.0|I am working on my hand and I cordination. This app helps a lot. I may even be able to take out zombies.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Rated G for language and with a 24hr rental my son watched it three times!! It is geared more for boys I think.
0425252868|5.0|A true story of two pilots from different sides of WW2 - showing that pilots have a different standard of war than many of the foot soldiers.  It brought a tear to my eye when they actually met 50 years later & became best of friends
B006RXQ0JO|5.0|It really had you thinking.  He did the right thing but the other way was better so doing the right thing was not the best thing to do
B009CF7GRY|5.0|Great movie, glad they kept the original soundtrack.  Did a great job remaking it, although nothing like the original.  Very funny and romantic.  Makes you think about the fine line that exists between church and government.  A must see.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|This is a Futuristic look at a world where people are born in test tubes and only have 30 years to live before they become &#34;runners&#34; and are hunted down by &#34;Sandmen&#34; unless they volunteer to compete in &#34;Carousel&#34; which is a game where nobody wins.<br /><br />It is a great thought provoking movie with great acting and the late Farrah Fawcett in her Hey Day.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The first app I downloaded to my new kindle  a super fun app for killing spare time :)  + three more words :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A literary classic brought to life in rare form. I can hardly wait for parts 2 and 3. If you are a fan of the books, this movie will not disappoint.
B002EMESSM|4.0|It moves a bit slower than the rest of them, but its still one of the greats. A must see for any Star Trek fan.
B007N5YJWK|3.0|Bought this expecting a stunning restoration of this classic movie only to find that the quality is around the same as the DVD I already had.  Only buy this if you don't already have it in your collection.  If you have the DVD, be content with that.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Whether you liked him or not, whether you buy Apple or not, this book provides great insight into who this man was, and how he was involved and influenced so many of the things we see and interact with today and into the future. Well worth a read.
B007XF4J70|1.0|Bought this a while ago and recently sat down to enjoy it.... only to find that the volume of the English soundtrack without commentary is so low that it is barely audible even on full volume.  The other soundtracks are just fine, so something is wrong in production.  The problematic sountrack indicates 6 Hz, while the rest are 48 Hz......<br />Too late to return it.  Buyer beware.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This is an album that will make everyone have some fun this year, it makes you dance, smile and wish you were at a club or dancing and having fun with you friends.<br />I have been listening to Nile Rdgeres for 30 yeasrs he is the man of the make me shake my ass guitar licks, just get this album and have some fun.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Pretty cool. Like the sounds and hd graphics. I also got it free with points. Easy to install and fun.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Lots of surprises which makes it exciting, its not one of those movies that draws you in though. They got into the horror part to quick which made it feel like you were watching random people. You didn't really feel like you knew them.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|These guys are truly artists. They'll use anything and everything to make a good album. Symphonies, electronica, guitars, effects. Even if you don't normally like symphonic metal, and especially if you do, you'll like this -  unless you're some ultra-purist who's not really about the music. They can even make the 80s sound good. This album really sounds like the soundtrack to a cyberpunk/supernatural/fighting-demons movie. &#34;Epic and cinematic.&#34; They can really create an atmosphere. Very professional. These guys know what they're doing and they're the best at it. This is not some garage band.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|This movie was not very good or funny. Rather boring! Zzzzzzzzzzzzz definitely rent as opposed to buy.  Barb's character was annoying.
B004WR125O|5.0|Replaced my old receiver after 20+ years and got a new Onkyo.  This LAN adapter was an optional purchase, but well worth it - takes my home stereo to a whole new level.  Love the internet radio!  My only complaint, and it's a small one: the menu display is only 2 lines.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is great, so many pictures to choose from, I have recommended this to many of our friends.  No dislikes on this item.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is game is fun for all ages and id highly recommend it to anyone who likes racing and free ride games.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great channel, when ad weather is coming I just open this up to see radar and daily forecast, I have recommended this to many of my friends.
B000JO9Y6I|2.0|Find these reviews baffling. Two things don't work for me in Dexter:<br /><br />#1 The reason Michael C. Hall was so very good in Six Feet Under was that he nailed the character. I don't think he has a clue who Dexter is. I don't see any consistency in his performance, at all. The way he walks, the way he smiles, and when; the way he delivers lines... There's an old acting tip, if you don't know what kind of expression to use, think of what you're going to have for supper that night. It covers all emotions. That's what Hall seems to be doing in this role-- and still has no clue what he's having for dinner.<br /><br />#2 It's poorly written. Any time you've got a character so off the rails, with his accompanying narration, that narration should be insightful. Surprising. Funny. Shocking. Whatever. But not insipid, which this again and again is.<br /><br />I gave it three episodes, and I doubt very much I'll give it any more.<br /><br />And this went SEVEN SEASONS???
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My grandparents got me this game for my DS in like 2009 and I saw it was here so I got it but its taking so long!
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Interesting story about the human condition. Needs to watch many times to catch all. Very good script. No gunfights or car chases - good!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I dont watch a lot of tv but shows like this will get you hooked very realistic I cant wait till the next episode
B00CW665VI|5.0|Can not wait for more by this author. A must read.  Laughed till I cried, had to stop reading a few times to get myself under control before starting again.  Loved the story coming totally from a guys point of view.  Nailed the way most guys think and I'm not talking about with the head above their shoulders.  You keep them coming and I will keep returning.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a real good book I could not put it down can't wait to read the next book I know it will be as good as this one
B0040I09RM|5.0|Once I started watching I was hooked. I've had too many late nights staying up watching the to see what the Tellers are up to next.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you liked the original Cut the rope, you will absolutely love this one. Especially for the only a dollar price! (:
B006LSZECO|1.0|Could not get thru it - I did not like the style of writing or the story theme.  I lost interest.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've been waiting fooooooorever for this app to come to the kindle. It's really a great fun game. Get it for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this app it is almost like the real thing.  The way it is not like real is you can't use Red stone but that will probably come the next update.  By the way did I mention that it is the best app ever.  You can play survival and it is just like the real mine craft PC.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This great for me!!!!!!!!!!!! Mine is a wonderful thing that I have a wonderful time here!!!!!!!!here is a wonderful thing that I like to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Still not bad for action and adventure. Naturally some if it unlikely but great for couch slumming. Get out the popcorn.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Entertaining read.  he ending was not quite what I expected but I enjoyed it. Hard to read about the way the young boy was treated---makes me want to punishthe keepers of the orphanage.<br />I would read more of this authors's works/
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Really good sci-fi. Absolutely loved it. Can't wait to finish seeing the other seasons. If you like this one, you should really also check out Stargate universe
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked this game a lot.  Reminded me of the old PC games like Myst. Just wish it was longer.
B009MYAQK4|4.0|I have liked all of the books by this author.  This one was a quick read,  with some good life related lessons.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|I haven't been successful in finding the type of books I am looking for.  Mainly military or military science books.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I have listened to Led Zeppelin since they began.  I even slept with headphones with Robert Plant singing me to sleep. Robert's voice calmed bad times even to this day.  They are the best band, they are good for my sole, always there and have never let me down.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I had original Live at Leeds album but wanted a complete album.  This is it.  By far the best quality live album I've ever heard.  Sounds crisp and the live playing of Tommy is breathtaking to listen to.  The Who are one of these bands where live beats in studio by a large measure.  You also get a good idea on the fun the guys have on stage, in a small venue.  Got CD & free mp3 from Amazon.  Can you wear out mp3s?  Hope not!
B004TI5N38|4.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite mystery writers.  He keeps you on the edge.  This book was hard to put down.  If you are a mystery fan David Baldacci is one of the best.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|This keeps getting better. CGI rates up there with Speilburg movies.  Great plot twists.  Wish this season was also free on Amazon Prime though.  Still, definitely worth it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its so fun I love this game it's so fun if you ever play this game you will fall in love but I can't lie it is kinda cool but real hard
B001ILHY1I|5.0|I was really impressed by the amount of work that went into the tricked-out cars, over the top guns, amazing stunts, and gritty location. The casting was top notch and the action was as good as it gets. I thought the ending was a little lame but all and all an excellent film.
B00000IQW5|5.0|It is a great timeless movie.  Makes you laugh; makes you cry! Great actors and and the wonderful Audrey Hepburn.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great and full of action. Good for younger. Children will love it. I have enjoyed this game so much.Best game ever
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was okay.  I wasn't quite sure what to make if it.  It was flirty in some parts, dry and slow in other; immature in some part; and with some heart in the other.<br /><br />It was like it was written by separate people who didn't keep the thread.<br /><br />I am not sure what all the hoopla was on the sexual side.  Gee, for the first third of the book, you were trying to get them to kiss - and these two were married.  Most of this stuff was hinted at and not necessarily blatantly described.  There was some, but only here and there.<br /><br />Instead of flirty, the book was way more involved with conflict, friction.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I've just discovered Michael Connelly, and I really like his plot development!  This was a really good story, and I really cared about all the hero's crew!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I'm enjoying the game... I like this type... I think more people should download. I'm just hoping I can do the multiplayer game
B0076DELIG|4.0|This one was fun to follow between past and present.  Harry Bosch might be a trial to live with, but reading about him is delightful!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book answers all the questions that the reader shares with Ana. It is and was very hard to put down.  I woke up this morning,around 4am and read for about an hour and a half. Then forced myself to go back to sleep.  I have not anything but read the book and go to work because I wanted to find out what happened next.  Five stars.
B000F8O35U|3.0|Nothing wring with the movie however I'd suggest waiting for the Blu-ray edition coming out this fall.  I returned this purchase due to broken tabs the hold in the center of DVD.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It was exactly as appeared and just what I wanted.  Would not hesitate to order from Amazon.  Just learning to use my Kindle and stand up feature of case makes it easier for me to use.  Thanks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think that it was an excellent book and it kept me entertained. I think it is on be of the best books ever
B008KE3960|5.0|I like it, it's really fun but it can get kind if boring if you play it for too long
B002OVEB5S|5.0|WPB is a great album. I love Slayer and in this opportunity didn't let me down. Read about of regular comments about it but the album simply great!<br />Haven`t had the time to watch the dvd yet...
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I bought this wonderful film to share with my grandson.  I had bought this on tape for my son many years ago and the message it conveys is still true
B002C6K7N0|3.0|I expected more from Mustaine and company. Is a great album, some great songs, some others left me in blank. But Megadeth is always good!!!
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Not much else to say. Lovely story of serendipitous meeting, love at first laugh, and bittersweet separation.  To be continued....  Oh, Julie is an amazing actress....charming, funny and charismatic.
B005974CDU|5.0|This album is an automatic classic. I love it. Dream Theater doesn´t seem to miss Prtnoy here. It's amazing how Mr. Mangini adapts himself to a band like DT.<br />Love it
B00846REIS|4.0|I don't necessarily think I can compare Bared to You to 50 Shades.  Most of the reviews are saying how they thought 50 Shades was a better written novel.  No way, unless they enjoy a book that seemed to be written by a child.  The repetition of that book was enough to drive anyone mad.  There are similarities between both books...both rich men with their own company, their past brings out anger, the women in their lives say that they will leave him every five seconds because they are jealous of a past love...enough of that.  Thankfully, Bared to You had a good storyline and was a quick read.  The characters are both working through past struggles that have affected their lives.  Will be interesting to see how the second book in the series is.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I like Jeffrey Archer writing,he does not overload with different cminor characters that also often confuse the storylineI have read all his books and would read all of them again
B002ZBRSMK|5.0|David Bowie, Candy Clark, Rip Torn, Buck Henry, Nicolas Roeg--and science fiction. Not to mention great Bowie hits like Wild Is the Wind. Singular classic, not to be missed. Perfect love story illustrating the multitude of lifetimes--personalities--relationships a human being contains unlimited by time and space. Beautiful production quality. Best seen on big screen.
B00A92MDH2|5.0|I remember this band from \\"Live In New York\\" then live in Baton Rouge, where I attended school. They were beyond excellent, despite being interrupted by some born again bonehead during \\"Titties And Beer\\", eerily like what is documented on the CD. I'll never forget this show. It was easily the best I'd ever attended, even surpassing the \\"Smell The Glove\\" tour. It was pure genius by all the players on the stage.
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|I must confess that I initially had no intention of watching this movie. Unlike everyone else, I hadn't known that it was based off of a book. I had prejudged the movie and story, and assumed it was going to be another terrible/immoral teen flick. It was not. On the contrary, I thought it was funny, sweet, dramatic, creative, silly, and a great deal of fun.  Alden Ehrenreich, AKA Ethan, (the main male character) was delightful. He was very funny, charming, and cool. Some of the other characters/actors were forgettable, but overall the acting was decent. I loved the wit behind the story and a lot of the lines were great. There were a lot of one-liners that some of the older crowd will appreciate. I actually saw the movie at a prescreening for free with a group of people. Most of the people in the group were young. Normally, I try to avoid watching a movie with a lot of young people, however, in this case it was refreshing. Everyone pretty much laughed at the same places, and smiled, cheered, and cried at all of the trials and tribulations. It was a great family film for older children/teens. I do not recommend it for small children, preteens, the easily offended, or impressionable people. Frankly, I still have no intention of reading the novel. The movie was satisfying and very well made. The direction, cinematography, and effects were great. Anyone who was upset or confused by the accents or the story should have paid attention. Everything was explained and was very easy to understand. Prior to seeing the movie, I read countless reviews to determine whether it was worth watching. I must say that anyone who disliked the accents should realize that the vernacular/patois in the movie was perfectly fine. I realize many do not wish to acknowledge it but the patois in the south differs from other regions in the US. In other words, they actually speak that way. Do not be misled by the naysayers who state that the movie is terrible. This is a movie and not a novel, and therefore should be considered as two different mediums/entities. In truth, this is one of those movies that will be appreciated by fans of the supernatural, and fantasy stories. In short, this is definitely worth watching.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game of solitare. The best part is that is is free. Try it you'll like it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game! I could play for hours. It is so simple to learn but to meet each challenge takes concentration and attention to detail. Recommended for anyone who wants a carefree thrill.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|History channel did a really good job with Vikings.  I loved it. It grabs you from the first episode and doesn't slow down.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Nom is too cute! You must use common sense and basic physics understanding to move up. It is easy and challenging at the same time. Great for all ages.
B007HOOAH6|5.0|We finally got my son trained just weeks shy of his 3rd birthday. Needless to say the last year has been a huge struggle and this book was a huge help. It got him re-interested in the potty and he would laugh and laugh at the story. I bought several different books but this one he picked every time. We had a hard time going number 2 on the potty but grandpa saved the day promising a weekend at his house with him. But this book really got him going number 1 every time so i definitely say it is worth the buy.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I think this is one of Mr. Buble's Best CD, Christmas or other. This is one of those that remind you what Christmas is all about. If you do not have it you should get one, Just Great.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Very egocentric, very narcissistic.......author should have gone for counseling and kept the good things and the great people in her life.
B009NY43NY|1.0|It was inconsistent with the rest of the series. The main characters who have been developed for so long did not seem like themselves anymore. Plus, there were WAY too many characters and &#34;cameo&#34; appearances to the point it felt like some bad anniversary/reunion sitcom episode. So disappointed in this book.
B00821OX98|5.0|Took me a few episodes to really get into it, but now I'm super sucked in. We can't wait for the premier of season three in a few weeks!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game...shame about the Facebook comments it wants you to write to get extra credits...but still addictive...enjoying enjoying it though as the first type of virtual game I 've played
B0089LOKHG|3.0|It was really really great up until the ending. It left me really disappointed. Seems like there needs to be a least one more book.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|Or any kind of critic for that matter, so take my opinion with a large grain of salt.  Amazon keeps asking me to review things I buy, I do so to placate them.  I like this album just fine.  A song or two I might skip parts (I'm looking at you, Big Sean, way to rhyme &#34;you&#34; with &#34;you&#34;, lyrical genius), but on the whole it's a fun time.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I have played this for a week and I'm hooked. It's really fun and it isn't like pay for this and you get to move on.
B003Z49LYO|2.0|This was a very sad badly written story that starts sad with constant drama for a young girl and finally end sad leaving you wondering why I watched this movie.  The only good thing is the pretty girl which plays very good stuck between bunch of crooks and idiots and finally dies!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is easy and fun but still challenging. I just got it today on my kindle fire but I have been playing it on my phone for about a year and I would say except for Words with friends it is the game I play most of all.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|great storyline.  too bad this amazing show was cancelled with so many unanswered questions that Mr. Whedon tried to answer some in a two hour movie &#34;Serenity&#34;.  Would recommend purchasing the series, as I watch if over again occasionally and it never bores me, just disappointed that it had to end too soon.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Good thing I love to learn.  Now I know a bit about mining in Canada.  Otherwise, this is a mediocre read, and probably has convinced me to not bother with another Kathy Reichs book.  And I've read them all so far.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Loved it. Great cast, great story. It's a well done, modern day and mature psychological thriller. It's refreshing to see good films made without all of the junk. This one is a solid and well acted film.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I could never get this to work. a waste of my time. Boo Boo would not try again. go suck an egg Iron Man game
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my sister a couple days ago as an upgrade for survival craft. So far I have been the one wanting to play it.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I wasn't really 'fat' to begin with. But was definitely overweight and was gaining weight at a very fast pace. I was always planning to join the gym but the plans never materialized and focusing on health always remained an unchecked item in my list of to-dos. I stumbled on the Amazon page of the other book by Gary Taubes (Good Calorie, Bad Calorie) while reading Nassim Taleb's Amazon reviews (Nassim is the author of 'The Black Swan', he goes by the name NN Taleb on Amazon reviews). So after reading his positive review, I bought this book (instead of 'Good Calorie, Bad Calorie' which I plan to read later) because someone had mentioned that this is shorter and more action oriented version. I bought the Kindle edition of this book on March 11, 2013 and started following it right away by starting with the suggested diet mentioned in the appendix section. Cutting the long story short, I have lost 7 Kgs since I started following the advice in the book i.e. 80Kg to 73Kg in two and a half months. And for my height I am in the normal weight range now.<br /><br />I am not implying that everyone can get the same results (results vary, even the book mentions this) but those following the 'low-fat' diets will never get any results because they are on the wrong path to begin with. The book is a real eye-opener on why carbs are the villain in the weight loss story and not fat. Also, those who think they can 'exercise' their excess body fat away should definitely read this book. I have still not joined a gym or started doing and regular fitness activity. I am not implying that exercise is not important for health, it definitely is, but it won't help with your weight loss so please don't fall in to the trap.<br /><br />In retrospect, I feel quite lucky to have stumbled upon this book. :)
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Le Carre at his best after a few that were not as good. One of his best yet. I liked it
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Did not bother to watch---too slow, hard to understand and lacked luster; not many intriguing pieces to the movie... pls refund
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have this app on my phone and absolutely love it. I have been waiting for it to come out in the Kindle app store and it finally came! The game is even better on the kindle due to the bigger screen!
B002NHGG92|5.0|Great series<br />It keep your interest and guessing at what will happen next.  If you like vampire movies you will enjoy this.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband started watching these, and he loves them.  I watch them also but like he does.  They are great.  Wish they had &#34;CC&#34; for him to read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|have always loved solitaire.. on the kindle fire the layout is simple and you get to compete against people allover..with wifi that is. fun to play without wifi too
B002WY65W4|5.0|I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again! Glad I finally broke down and bought it.
B005HSL626|5.0|even though I suck at this game it is simple and addicting.. love the little fruit facts after a session used the lemon one actually.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A beautiful book with a powerful ending, I think it is my favourite Mitch Albom yet.<br /><br />\\"It is never too late or too soon. It is when it is supposed to be.\\" Albom's recent novel introduces three characters who have lost sight of the meaning of time and are consumed by a desire to measure it, to speed it up or to slow it down. A deceptively easy and enjoyable read, it nevertheless raises questions about how we value--or perhaps waste--time.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|its easy at first once you get used to it..then it gets real challenging ..download this ish while its free or you're missing out..on another side note the totem dudes words of encouragement nears borderline ...like he's trying to mac on you.
B00BT0ZS52|3.0|Love the story.  Tom did so well I didn't recognize him in some of his characters at first (one of my top complements to an actor).<br /><br />Too bad the theme was driven home with the force of a sledgehammer on a railroad spike.<br /><br />And it would have been nice to see some development over the character's lifetimes, rather than just seeing the same character strengths and weaknesses in life after life.  But maybe that's just my (spiritual) perspective.<br /><br />Enjoyed it all the same.  Lush cinematography, great acting.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|One of their best! Strong musical efforts tied with great lyrics make this a very good album from start to finish.
B004BDJS9Q|4.0|My 30-something kids love this movie, and if I were their age I would to.  The Mario and Zelda references were awesome, and I think I'd have been ROTFL if I'd gotten the tons of other references I'm sure were there ... the nerdy kid-super-hero-loves-the-unreachable-cool-girl vs. super- villain theme was done to a T.  I need to watch it again, 'cause I'm sure there were many touches like the video-game dead guys outlined in ...(OK, I won't spoil it), just a glimpse in the corner of a frame -- not dwelled on, just there for a flash.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price of admission to your living room.
B003F29D44|5.0|Well done movie that keeps your interest throughout. Although done years ago it could have been made this year as the issues it covered are so current.  Great choice to have the father and son team played by real father and son. Michael Douglas always a great choice for a strong, rich and smart character.
B008XFJEE2|2.0|OK movie if you like a jerk that is totally self serving person that does not care his lover. Kim Basinger is a lovely person and should carefully choose the movies she stars in.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent, stupendous, exhilerating, relaxing, challenging, worth its price and more, frustrating, addictive, makes me feel smart, good and fun waste of time
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I am always left wondering what was my favorite season of Fringe. One? Love the establishment of the mythology. Two? Adore the defining of the personal relationships. Well, it very well may be season 3. The reason is simple.....my favorite show became two outstanding shows. These marvelous actors managed to play two distinct sets of people in the most superlative manner possible.<br /><br />If I could only watch one show for the rest of time, this is my show.
B009M2T7K6|4.0|My daughter loves this. She received it for her 5th birthday.  It changes colors as it says  but I think maybe the colors aren't that different. She loves it so that is important
B005PK56TA|4.0|Zachary Quinto steals the show.<br />The ending was quite abrupt.<br />Uneven. Some episodes amazing, some decent.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable.<br />I wish the second season followed the major loose story line, but I don't think it does (haven't watched it yet).
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Really enjoy game n cooking great past time wveryone in the family plays even my 2 year old grandson and his 3 year brother also kerps then quiet
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I used this with a Mac Book pro and a Iphone repairs. so far so good.Hoever, the number of tools is impressive. The cost is now cheap.
034580404X|5.0|This book its awesome I wish I had a Christian grey too. This book Its about love, sex, drama and suspense. .
B005HJU7HA|3.0|This classic story of early English intrigue is well written, but lags after a few pages. The reader has to labor to get through the script. Although the 'kindle edition' is an excellent way to read this novel, it still falls below my expectations for a truly exciting detective novel.
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|Mein kampf is a interesting look into the other side of history that we never are shown. I would recommend  it to anyone interested in ww2,
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I could not put this book down! I loved all the 80's references from my childhood as well as the OASIS idea. This book is a fun and easy read. I highly recommend it!
B000FC146C|5.0|I have loved this book for many, many years...read it first and then watched the mini series.  I love the story.  I laughed and cried while reading this book and watching the mini series.  It will always remain one of my all-time favorite stories.
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|This is a movie that should be talked about much more...it's Oscar worthy in many ways, writing, direction, and the acting is off the charts (I forget names).  A brilliantly told story...watch it and pass it on so it gets the credit it deserves and more great movies like this, by these people, get into our homes and lives.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't believe I have to wait for the next book!!! Thus is going to kill me!! This book is a complete package..
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I liked this film...odd to watch because I have the disorder myself, but I don't run with a plastic bag, but the rest is pretty close (being a comedy and all).  Lawrence is great...rent Winter's Bone if you haven't figured out how this young woman shot to stardom so quickly...it will become obvious, she's brilliant in it and the movie is great.
1423140605|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's books and I love the Percy Jackson books. Part 3 of the Heroes of Olympus is amazing. It is worth buying and reading. :D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You should play this game it is the best game I ever played before you can get a rainbow unicorn and other things like that.
1616550414|5.0|I am a HUGE HUGE Zelda fan and I am so happy I bought this. It contains so much information on the Zelda series and lots of beautiful artwork. If you love Zelda then this book is the best thing ever.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The same review for all the books in the series - same comments apply.<br /><br />It was so promising...the writing style in itself is much more put together than you would expect from a novice writer.  However, that seems to be its only saving grace.  The overarching storyline is intriguing, but the details of the story leaves much to be desired.  Certain ways that the characters act are just too unbelievable - how they talk, what they say.<br /><br />It feels that the author is trying just a little too much.  As the story (and series) progresses, I find myself reading just to finish the story line but I'm not actually reading the book, just scanning for the major plot points to advance the story just so I can finish off the story line.<br /><br />I'd compare it to Raymond Feist and the Eddings, but the very very rough draft version.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is one of the most awesome apps out there.  Plus the fact that it is so handy, and can provide light when most needed.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|A Visit From The Goon Squad is, on one level, a collection of stories.  Some of them have obvious connections, others merely echo themes or feature a character from another part of the book. But, despite all logic, the whole thing hangs together as a \\"novel\\" - it's a complete take on the \\"modern\\" world and where we're going reflected through an incredibly variety of view points (the chapter that had everyone talking is composed of a power point presentation, and it manages to be one of the most moving sections of the book).  Egan is a stylist with incredible control over the narrative and the language, but her greatest strength is real empathy.  Highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using this calculator its nice its big ease of use every time I can,t do without it I Will  recommend this to everyone

B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay I don't even know where to begin. Tangled by Emma Chase is one of the best books I've read in a long time! I was laughing so hard through most of it although I still managed to get teary-eyed a couple of times (I'm sappy that way). I could not put this book down! Telling the story from Drew Evans' POV was just brilliant! So often we read these awesome books and then wish we could read them again from the guy's POV and Emma Chase provided that for us in the most entertaining, amusing and fun way possible! Drew is hilarious! I loved how he has no filter and just tells it like it is. Typical guy but you don't hate him for having his guy thoughts or guy beliefs because he owns up to them. He warns you that's who he is. And he is just lovable! And Kate is awesome in her own way too. This book is so well written! It sucks you in immediately and the characters, all of them, are amazing. I'd love to see this story continued and some of the supporting characters' stories developed more. I don't know if there is a plan for a sequel but I certainly hope so!! I highly highly recommend this book!!! loved it so much! Thank you Emma Chase for bringing us Drew's humor and allowing him to share his story while he's got the \\"flu\\".
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved the book.  The story was engaging and thrilling.  It was a page turner all the way.  The writing was descriptive and well done.  The ending was satisfying.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very fun. One can submit your electronic horse into competitions or get poijts for takings ng care of it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game.  It's positively addictive.  Simple, lots of fun, great graphics, stable, no game-play issues.  It's pure pleasure.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I have played many of this type of game and always enjoyed it and this one is no exception.  It is fun to see if you can clear the board and then you can move on to other layouts.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is the best thing I've read in a while it is almost as good as Harry potter and At times Fowl!!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Easy to use. I like to double check my math and  it's nice to have this handy on my phone.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|This movie lets you go with her and her struggles as she finds her life with michael as he transforms
B00COGXX7A|4.0|enjoyable and entertaining, could have done without the weird ending though....the two leads lacked chemistry but I was pleasantly surprised by Julianne's Hough's depth as a new actress- would like to see more of her
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Reading Anne Frank's diary was an eye opening experience.  Under extraordinarily stressful circumstances, Anne committed herself to her self-education and devised methods of coping with the stress and fear while hiding in the Annex with her family and others.  Her self awareness and social awareness are very advanced for her young age, and even more impressive since she cultivates these qualities while in extreme isolation.  Her personal story is a triumph of the spirit set in the context of unthinkable tragedy.  There is something for every reader to learn from reading this book, again and again.  This &#34;definitive&#34; version presents a fuller, more rounded view of the personhood of Anne Frank. The writings of Viktor Frankl are a good complement to this book.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|fun game wish there were more like it. wish there were more the same as this game is fubln and sometimes it takes up my day
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The foreword is essential.  Frankl's first-person documentary of the concentration camps is followed by an explanation of his emerging philosophy called logotherapy.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to grasp the lessons that can be gleaned from this dark period in world history.  The diary of Anne Frank and the writings of Elie Wiesel are good complements to this book.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like this app...you can look up weather anywhere. This is a must have if you spend a lot of time outside.

B008602KQI|2.0|i did not like the concept of the movie... few sequence and actions in the movie are quite unrealistic.. lot of violence scenes.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So sexy....so \\"informative\\" ... and so funny!!! The most entertaining book I have EVER read!!!! Drew is such a \\"guy\\" and is love life is interesting....and Kate is so smart and sexy and a worthy heroine!! Thank you Emma Chase!!
B008BIZBIY|5.0|I have always used Plextor cd burners in the past and they have always worked perfectly. The burned cd's sounded excellent and played with no problems. Recently I purchased a new computer and burned some cd's that would not play in my car so I purchased this Plextor cd and dvd burner to replace the new one that came in my pc. Problem solved and the price was much less than I thought it would be.
B001974DG0|5.0|I love dogs and this storyline pulls all of your heart strings. Wonderfully written and edge of your seat in excitement waiting for the next chapter.
0061537969|5.0|I bought this book in an airport before a flight and what serendipity! I read constantly and I have not read a book in years that so touched me and left me so heart-constricted.  The characters come alive on the pages and Enzo, what can I say? He is a beautiful old soul.  When I finished this book, I just began reading it again as it was all I could think about. If you want a &#34;good read&#34;, this is it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|only reason people ever. need real money to play the game is if they are too impatient to wait for stuff to build or waste all the diamonds they get.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved it. The problem solving was fun and challenging, but you can use hints as many times as you need to. The graphics are breathtaking. I was sad when the game was over.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|It works likea charm, but it would be great if it had a screen recorder setting, so I wouldn't have to root my kindle. (Which I'm thinking of doing)
B006H5120E|5.0|Aside the fact that it is a good story it has a great 3D effect. Most movies do not come close.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|Yes.  One of my favorites as a child.  I have fond memories of watching this with my older brothers.  Awesome.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|When I pulled it up to use, it would not go to the program I expected to find to play.
B00AFARIZA|4.0|Most of these recordings were first issued on CD in the 80s and early 90s, the Beethoven dating to the early 80s and the others clustering around 1990. As the notes on this release acknowledge, this issue uses those digital masters. This does mean, unfortunately, that the sound is the same as it used to be. The extreme example is the Sibelius, which made aggressive use of the CEDAR process in its initial release; it has the worst sound of the lot. I sincerely wish that EMI had taken advantage of more than twenty years of progress in our understanding of sound and early recordings to produce new and better masters.<br /><br />The performances themselves are generally outstanding, a reflection of a peak period in Toscanini's career. The Beethoven 6th has long been justly admired and sounds well here. Of equal distinction are the performances of the Enigma Variations and La Mer, both of which demonstrate the nonsense of the idea that only a true Englishman or Frenchman can do justice to \\"national\\" music. I admire the Brahms considerably: though the Philharmonia versions have better sound and better performances, it is interesting to hear what Toscanini did at this stage in his career with these works that he often rethought.<br /><br />In sum, these discs offer a convenient and cheap way to pick up these excellent performances. If only EMI had applied the latest technology to the sound, they would have been brilliant.
1439152802|5.0|I loved this book without feeling like I had to compromise my soul to do it. It is full of adventure and mystery and mind-bending twists and turns, romance and deceit and war, good but imperfect people as well as the deplorable and the forgivable. I loved it for its family values--it made me want to give up being a crocodile and have a little more fun with my kids.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Every chapter starts the same way, contains the same &#34;complaints&#34; about authority, and ends the same way. After 1/3 of the book it became extremely boring.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Sit back and relax, enjoy the time travel back into the past. What a solid album. Don't miss out on this gem.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Just started &#34;Hornets Nest&#34; I need to see how the Slander story ends ... if it does. I think I could have stopped after the first book and been ok - beware once you start reading this one you will want to read the next!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Every episode is interesting with difficult legal cases to be solved.  The main characters are well developed and consistent in their<br />actions.
B0036UW09U|4.0|I'm not crazy about her doing up tempo stuff but enjoyed most of thiis.Worth watching just for the amazing vocals.
B003F3NE1Q|2.0|I would describe the earlier seasons of Grey's Anatomy as insightfully written and exceptionally well cast with a very fine group of actors.  In season 6, the show transformed from medical drama into a high-budget soap opera.  The series now appears to be hastily produced - the episodes consist of haphazardly written vignettes, complete with insipid dialog and way-over-the-top medical scenarios.  I will enjoy re-watching the earlier seasons (1-5) but season 6 is one to be forgotten.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Only reason I am not giving it five stars is that it has an annoying ad system after the game.
B00CM96A60|5.0|When it comes to electronic music I'm usually one of those that will pick 1 or 2 tracks from an album, buy them separately and call it a day.<br />Armin did an amazing job with this latest album.  It's one of the most well compiled and solidly built albums from a DJ that I've seen in years.  Very worth the purchase.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|After purchase of this in the rookie format... I purchased this more advanced for my friend & young neighbor.<br /><br />My granddaughter had fun with the Rookie version...<br />My young teenaged neighbor was in a horrible auto accident. ( reaching for Dropped cell phone while driving )<br />Head injuries among numerous others.... left this beautiful young man with memory loss and diminished hand --eye co ordination.  I gave him this &#34;game&#34;. With an incentive bet that his dad would be the first one to reach for it if the young man left it in the coffee table.  It worked!<br />Our family has contests with it.... And again.... It Does Not have a plug or batteries.  . Amazon sends me alllll
B001ANYDAO|5.0|While there exist a plethora of books and studies on the lives of successful people, Gladwell's treatment of the subject goes in a whole new direction that provides new insight into what makes successful people tick and how we can use that knowledge to improve people's lives. Very well-written and readable.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Excellent! Jake Bugg is not pre-polished and tied-up in a corporate package with a pretty bow. He's tapping into the long-neglected mine of the past and creating his interpretation of what music inspired him and taking it to new levels. To my ears, he's a mixture of British skiffle and rock and roll, heavily influenced by American country and folk, and all mixed into the type of sound that can get you bouncing on your toes, and with the next song get you wiping away the tears. His voice has that special, classic sound that breaks your heart, even though, thankfully, it's not a product of a putrid TV talent contest, It's REAL, and his guitar playing is REAL, and his fellow musicians are REAL, and his songs and lyrics (with the help of collaborators in some instances) are REAL. Every song is a gem! I haven't been this moved by a CD in years, and I haven't played one so much since...I can't remember! Since Nirvana!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I had read some negative reviews on this movie, I just saw it today in 3D, it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, it is terrific.  Just love the characters in it, they have been cast so well, they all match like it was the lst day Star Trek was here.  Don't believe any negatives on it, go see it.<br />Ginny
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept me<br />so entertained, I can't wait for the sequel to cone out in July.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best TV series ever. We never watched before because we don't subscribe to Showtime. But Amazon brings it right to us for only $1.99 per episode. Well worth it. Cant wait for Season 2 to be available
B00632HWOG|4.0|good, but I haven't figured how to send email to groups in my yahoo mail lists. Other than that it is great!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Let me start by saying i am an avid reader, and writer myself, so I hold the novels I read to high standards. Well, she absolutely blew it out of the water. This books balance is incredible. It keeps you intertwined with the characters emotions and intent with each page. The snappy dialogue had me laughing out loud with each freaking page-- i loved it!!!  The perfect balance of angst, humor, sex and love. This will, inevitably be a re-read... perhaps tomorrow:)<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy it I promise you won't regret it!!!
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|It's ridiculous that people who have never read a book by Charles Bukowski in their entire life, nor know anything about the man, can buy a book because it's $1.99 and rate the author poorly after one read. To the people I speak of, you're lucky to be able to buy this book for $1.99 and even luckier that you read it. Maybe you didn't get it, and probably should never pick up another one of his books, but don't slam the author and ruin someone else's chance to be exposed to one of the greats! Basically you don't know what you are talking about.<br /><br />Also, it's not the author's fault if the text is screwed up on the kindle edition. Think about it!
B000006Y4E|5.0|I hate hysteria and all the stuff after. This is vintage Def Leppard. This is a must have for the fans!

0440422973|5.0|John Grisham hits a home run with this simple novel.  The idea of skipping Christmas has probaly passed all of our minds.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers has always been my favorite game. My friend and I always try to beat each others scores.In my opinion,this game is better than Temple Run! I like how you don't have to tilt the device, just swipe your finger.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|To quote my young nephew who introduced me to this game: &quot;Do it!&quot; It is fantastic. Great graphics, constant action, and addictive fun.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I researched this light carefully and the many Amazon reviews were extremely helpful and that is why I'm adding my two cents for others who are looking into adding an attachable flash to  their Nikon camera (mine is the D3100). I'm an 85 yr old trying to get more &#34;serious&#34; about doing really good photography. I'm into flower macro photos, photos of my wife and family members, and anything else I can get in front of a camera that looks interesting. On the first few uses of this light indoors with my wife as subject and doing a lot of light bouncing, the results were astonishing. This delivers a very soft light and learning to bounce it is rather easy. Soon thereafter, I ordered the cable that enables you to remove the light from the camera, and also bought a light box ($13) that wraps around the speed light for use in macro and close up portrait photography. I do not expect to ever have more than one of these so the expansion cord was the most inexpensive way to get more latitude in where the light comes from on to the subject. It works well, though it will help to have a helper to hold it or a tripod for your camera while you hold the light. The Nikon light system is nothing short of amazing. You'll get better photos with this light even if you don't hardly know what you are doing.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good read, lots of action and intrigue. A real fantasy book. Good if you are into fantasy and romance reads.
0670014893|2.0|Loved his earlier works; gobbled them up greedily the day they came out, practically. But this one? Continues his unfortunate downward trend to simplicity that sounds like a cranked-out made-for-TV movie. The depth is gone, the insight and character development, ditto. I really wanted to like it, but found myself, at its unsatisfying conclusion, saying, \\"That's IT??\\" Even Grisham and Clancy seem better by comparison. Is he merely coasting on his laurels?  I think I may, regrettably, be done with LeCarre. Sorry, old chap.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is the best app I've seen in the photo editing department there are so many  things you can use to edit and clip art, it's almost like you can write a picture book it's so great I recommend this for all ages. 8)
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Well acted and not cheaply made.  I like this movie, but I can not recommend it to just anyone.  It takes a 'certain' person to find it funny.  Luckily there is a lot of these &#34;certain' persons.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Entertaining treatment of an important topic:  The obesity epidemic in the US and its cause, eating too much bread, and pastry of all kind. I've heard for decades that fat is evil and the cause of a multitude of health problems. The myth perpetrated on the public by Jean Mayer and a few others, that eating fat was the cause of blocked arteries and heart disease, set off a flood of bad diet fads in our culture.<br />Fat was removed from processed food and replaced with sugar and highly refined flour. Dr Atkins was one of the first diet gurus to dispute the low fat fad. Poor man died before he saw his low carb regime accepted. Gary Taubes, Jeff Volek and Steve Phinney followed with scholarly work on the damage done by low fat diets.<br />Dr Davis expands on the evolution of wheat cultivation practices which made the grain higher in gluten and more fattening.  He has a funny bone too, which helps move the narrative along.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Great, enjoyable movie that parallels the classic disney movies like beauty and the beast and fox and the hound. It is great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I like to read peoples' after life experiences.  This one is thorough and it is amazing that the writer lived.  It doesn't matter that chemicals and changes in the brain might be the cause of these experiences.  What matters is that they do exist.  Highly recommend this book.  And it is well written, too.
B0015346OM|5.0|It seems timely to finish this book Memorial weekend. This an outstanding book that dramatically recounts battle without being overly dramatic. Bowden obviously put a lot of work into this book and his research seems well supported. Ultimately this a very humbling book and leaves one with a sense of questioning, sorrow, pride and awe.<br /><br />Let's not forget our fallen this Memorial Day.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie lots of action. I heard it was the one which caught the eyes of directors and started her career.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Normally I can figure out how a book is going to end after the first few chapters.  I thought I knew how this one would end, but I was completely wrong. There are so many twists; it will keep you on the edge of your seat until you are done. This book was one of the best I have read in a while.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game with my sister. its one of my favorite games on my kindle. it would be cool if they added a new monster.....

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely the BEST!  I have become so enmeshed with the characters that I I hate for the ending of each season to come!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is a movie that I believe every parent should see. This movie helps peole understand a little more about Bipolar Disorder. People I have mentioned this movie to say they don't need to watch another football movie. That is not what this movie is about.The acting in it was fantastic.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I am not into silly comic romance movies at all.  Since I like both of the leading actors, I gave it a shot one night when it was on a movie channel.  It is a very touching story - a little comedy plus drama which was delightful.  I wouldn't want to spoil the end for anyone, but I will admit at the end of the movie when it said it was based on a true story, my tears were flowing freely. I don't understand how some pan it, but for me it was an evening well spent!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Not nearly as good as expected.  I think if you like watching c-span, you'll probably like this movie.  I wasn't even convinced Daniel Day-Lewis was that good.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The storytelling style is interesting, but ultimately impersonal. The stories are weaved together well, but the ever-changing cast of characters is hard to connect with.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it,kept turning the pages couldn't put it down.The ending has me, looking forward to the next book hope it is just as good!
B000FA675C|5.0|Dispite its pop culture fame, its one of the most creative and original stories out there. Yes, even with its similarities to Holy Blood Holy Grail.  I think its one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, and isn't that the point?
B00459GJUM|4.0|I don't care what anybody days. I like this show. It's got solid writing, good acting and the backdrop is super cool.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all of Clancy's fiction and I love the Jack Ryan series. This book is like the &#34;old&#34; Clancy and I loved it. It is fast paced and impossible to put down.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My class read this book in novel group, and I'm so happy I picked this book! It's funny and the main character was easy to connect to. It was such a touching story so I would reccomend this book.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Makes you think about where your food comes from!!  Thanks for putting this on Prime so I could watch it at my leisure this week.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|It seems jeffery Archer gets better and better.  Hopefully you will read the two books that precede this one (and I think one more coming!).  It is in plain langage - INTERESTING.  And that pertains all three so far.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It's really slow and takes a long time to actually get into it

B000K4WPCM|5.0|This is a good movie. It's like the craft but with guys as witches with special powers. Good movie. Great price
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a remarkable book for many reasons.. the fact that Dr Alexander was essentially brain dead, yet was having a vivid experience in another realm, is only part of what makes it so magnificent.<br />His recovery, coupled with his desire and ability to prove to others in his field and in the field of medicine in general, that what he experienced defies what had previously been thought to be the only reality, is a testament to his devotion to and compassion for the rest of us, having our own experience here on earth.<br />With his help, we may be able to get the medical profession to understand the true nature of life as we know it.. that we are spiritual beings, here for a reason.. and that death is merely a portal to return home.
B009AMAGXK|3.0|I wanted to see this movie when it came out but didn't. Just bought it and its not what I expected. It was good, but I thought it would have more special effects
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game. Challenging. Plenty of goals to reach. The kids and I all have fun playing this one.  Trying the different vehicles on the different levels with upgrades and beating your previous records. Good times.
B005CM1INE|5.0|Such a good movie. One of my favorites. Looks amazing on bluray. The quality and sound are perfect. Highly recommend
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Some of the best acting that we've seen from some of the best actors that we love to watch. Each of the principals plays multiple roles in multiple timelines to create a timeless fantasy of edge-of-your-seat plots. Driven by an outstanding score, the cinematography is itself a visual symphony. The rhythm of the movie transports the audience through a kaleidoscope of emotions, ultimately concluding the journey with a sense of understanding and appreciation of its complexity.  A word of warning: Viewers who prefer a straightforward script with a continuous timeline may become frustrated at all the twists and turns.
B003M8NG94|4.0|Funny movie. I'm a huge Tim burton fan. It's movie is about aliens that take over the us. It has a great cast. About 20 well known actors an actresses.

B0016MJ6T2|4.0|This movie is a little out there. You have to be pretty open minded to watch it. It's basically about gay party boys Seth green and Macaulay Culkin. They goto different parties and dress up in costumes and do drugs through the whole movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this because it actually has a x(times) button on it..Most virtual calculators don't have this feature..I use it all the time
B004X6PRO6|5.0|My book club just read this book, and many of us absolutely loved it. While it's dark, often disturbing, and at times quite sad, Adam Johnson does an excellent job providing a glimpse into the secret world of the North Korean regime. While the book is fiction, his thorough research and attention to detail makes it feel like a true story. He really captures the human element of life in North Korea, which makes the story so moving. An amazing read, very deserving of the Pulitzer, and certainly worth reading. I highly recommend.
B00004TJTS|5.0|very very good movie.  always like the stories that are told in a past tense about their childhood adventures as told by the author.  similar in way to The Waltons; at the end of each episode, john boy would make his closing remarks on the events of the episode.  So does this author in My Dog Skip
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I absolutely loved the first two books of this trilogy, but must admit the final book was a let down. I almost feel as though Archer was tired of the story and just wanted to finish it quickly. The intricate storyline that Archer is famous for was just not of the same caliber as the first two books. Would I recommend it? Yes, but not with the same enthusiasm as the first two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever. I can play it for hours on end! so far I have 5 chests full of sixty-four stacks of wooden planks.  I wonder what the world record is? HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The story was forgetable, there was not enough action, the characters were one demintional. It did not hold my interest and I fell asleep half way.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|The ending was awful and completely unrealistic.  The inferences to what the son may or may not have were shallow; we needed to see inside of him.  Because of the ending, I will be reluctant to read another book by this author
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Great simple puzzle / rpg. Keeps my short attention span, and keeps me coming back for more. Definitely worth the cost for hours of fun.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George RR Martin never disappoints with his epic novels but Game of Thrones grabbed me like none other. I couldn't put it down and was hungry for more when I read the last page
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I HAVE ALWAYS HATED DOING FRACTIONS. THIS IS A GREAT TOOL FOR ME. MY GRANSON ALSO ENJOY USING IT TOO.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Too much information is left out making this movie a complete mess plus a lot of changes to the story that don't make any sense like how the library had the book of the moon from the start.  The only reason I'm even giving this 2 stars is because of the actors.  It feels like this movie could of been great just really poorly directed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome but it freezes allot and it is addicting but you would like it if you like to build villages than this game would be good for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I'm a big fan of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence so this was a slam dunk. They have great chemistry in this movie. Bradley managed to take a serious mental disorder (bipolar) and make it funny but something that can be overcome. If you want a feel good movie, this is it!!
B005JZBPHS|1.0|The L Word Series. This was a big disappointment the was none of the Tibette scenes.Thought it would be the whole story. There was nothing of the tibette scenes in it. wish they would sell the tibette series. I would buy.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|i LOVED THE MOVIE I love Brit anyways.Live love and have fun in life,I don't mind reviewing this stuff but to many words needed .I loved the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a truly awesome game... If you can think it, you can pretty much build it, depending on what it is. It is really fun to fight zombies, creepers, and spiders. Just put some torches in your house to make sure they don't spawn in it... BEST GAME EVER OTHER THAN CALL OF DUTY.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|much more confusing than the first.  half the time you don't understand what they want you to do. puzzles are ok not as strait foreward as the previous game. don't bother.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is an amazing book for teenagers. Being one myself i am sure that it will open their eyes to the signs of the emotional and physical struggles they go and their friends and get help or see their friend go through it and help them. Very heart tearing story.
B009SCR7RU|5.0|My daughter likes it and will watch it back to back to back...  Everytime I start it she tells me it is missing a star.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like to play this when I get bored mostly I just don't like the part where it takes a while to regenerate coins.... but overall it's a good game!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Even the kids find it easy to use  - yet large text so also easy to read.would recommend to as anyone
B00005JLEU|5.0|I first saw spirited away with subs. If you are a fan of Hayao Miyazaki you will love the film. You will fall in love with Chiro a ten year old girl caught in the spirit world. If you don't have it in your collection and are a lover of Japanese culture get this dvd. Even if you are not get this dvd. You will absolutely love this film.
0525958002|5.0|I have been a fan of Duran Duran for years. I saw this book originally in Barnes and Noble for a higher price. My only complaint is that the book jacket was torn during shipping as it was packed loosely in the box.
B004L9IDD2|5.0|The graphics are awesome  story line will keep you on the edge of your seat. I laughed and I cried. It makes you wonder.... what if? Believe it or not I just got turned on to the Evangelion franchise. You don't have to know the story from the beginning but it helps if you go back to the series of several years ago. If you have seen 1.11 get this dvd and add it to  your collection. You will not be dissapointed.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is awesome. Of course they have the right to charge anything they want for their chosen in game currency, but dude! Even to just play without waiting between turns can cost you something! That being said....it's still awesome!
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Great cg. Storyline very engrossing. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved all the characters. I can't wait to view 2.22. Add this to your collection. you will not regret it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really like this game. However it's a bit annoying that you need pearls to create rare items yet pearls are very far and in between to get unless you purchase them with real money.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I Really loved this book! Couldn't put it down and am eagerly awaiting the second one! Hope it comes out very soon
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard... Easy to learn.... Swype type capabilities included... So you can type or swype at the same time in the same sentence... No crashes... Very stable on HTC EVO 3D phone.... Highly recommended...
B009MYAQOA|5.0|I will continue to read this book over and over through the years.  The creative lifestyle is like non other.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie Kinsella delivers again. I love the way she builds tension, actual tension..like one might get from a horror story.. yet in each novel the topic of tension is about something so ridiculously far from my actual life such as which gorgeous guy the girl will get. Real life has plenty of real stresses and Kinsella's writing is a delightful escape. Some of her books feel over too soon, and this way excelled at playing out the tension a bit longer by adding on a second story line.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I enjoyed the book even though the events were somewhat repetitive.  It was very interesting to look into the mind and personality of someone who liked to kill people
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|What amazed me is that, even if the kindle is shut-down the alarm clock still works!  It's a keeper.  :)
B0092EE5HY|4.0|If you're looking for a Game of Thrones spinoff, it's not here.  But, if you like old-fashioned sci-fi like Robert Heinlin, this is great.
B00138EXAQ|4.0|I was only interested in the song Such A Night, but ended up getting the whole album. It was a good purchase since I got the whole album for less than $10 and in the format I want.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a good story! The story line captured my attention and kept my nose in the book.  There are some good surprises in the plot, too.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I didn't like this game. I downloaded it because it looked like Pitfall for the Atari 2600. It starts out like that but then you come to a monster. In stead of fighting it or jumping over it you have to play bejewel and line up four swords on the game grid below the scrolling action screen. Lame.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I truly enjoyed this sweet love story. The details of the story line were intriguing and kept me reading to find out what was going to happen next.
193700788X|1.0|I can remember buying the first book, finishing it in two days and rushing back to the store to buy the remaining ones out. I shared them all with everyone from work and they did the same. I realize you can't please every fan. That's simply impossible but this felt like there was no heart left for any of these characters to do them any justice. Like they were given up one before the first word hit the paper.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never seen the original run, but started watching the show lately on Netflix. This show is most original, well written, and with well developed characters and story lines. I wish I could have seen and supported it when it was running.<br />I can not believe they canceled it. ...this is a diamond in the rough. I wish they would renew the show, because I will watch it religiously. Great Writers!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was off the charts great for 2 reasons. 1) being Drew Evans!!!!! I have never laughed so hard. I was rolling start to finish! He is absolutely hysterical and so is Kate! 2) a mans POV. I don't think I've ever read a book strictly from a mans POV. I was so entertained I couldn't put the book down. It never dragged on one time for me. I couldn't wait to see what they would say next. It was brilliantly written and thoroughly entertaining! Will recommend to everyone I know!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this more than 20 years ago the first time.  Very good again despite reading it after book 2 & 3 this time (which my daughter had put in the book shelf). Card writes it as teen fiction, but the characters live out adult scenarios, so it isn't too juvenile to enjoy.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app. I awake to calming sounds...not crazy beeping!!!! I also love that it gives the outside temperature on it... :)
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|Love Cuban music, the sounds, the feel, the movement. First rate musicians, on a very good recording, a great pleasure on a rainy day in the Pacific Northwest.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game helps kids learn how it is important to pay attention when you drive while they ate having fun
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Love this movie! Love the fast pace, the action & the revenge component but oh, HOW I LOVE THE CARS!!!! (This movie is the reason I coveted a MINI Cooper for years & am still driving one now!) A really FUN movie!
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|Always loved the songs. Great rhythm and beat, soothing, understandable, and lively. One of my favorite albums from the early days.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|it is exciting and challenging. I love the graphics . My favorite place is the dark forest . it is really cool
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is just like grand theft auto  great graphics and you're in a gang and gang members follow you best in the world
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should get it. It is so cool I play it with my sister all the time. I love it
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Terrific script, great acting, and based on a true story.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Ms. Setterfield is an excellent writer.  I couldn't put it down.  Although I almost had the mystery figured out 2/3 of the way through, it twisted slightly at the end.  Very good book!
B0094K1WZE|1.0|THAT WS MY 82-YEAR OLD MOTHER'S OPINION AND SHE LOVES HER ACTION FILMS.  SHE REALLY LIKES THE SWEDISH VERSIONS OF &#34;THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE&#34;, ETC - BUT HATED THIS. SHE DID LIKE THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MUCH BETTER BUT SAID &#34;THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS&#34; IN THIS ONE.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Anything Chris Cornell is involved with is usually pretty good. But being back with Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron, and Ben Shepherd he's even better. Soundarden rocks and so does this comeback album!
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT IN THE THEATER AND HAD TO BRING IT HOME TO KEEP RE-RUNNING.  MAGNIFICENT DETAIL - I WANT TO KEEP RUNNING JUST TO SOAK IN ALL THE SET DETAILS AND PROPS - THE VICTORIAN FURNITURE IS EVERY BIT VICTORIAN FURNITURE LIVED IN BY PEOPLE THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF VICTORIANS DRESSED IN THE RIGHT CLOTHING, DIRT IS WHERE DIRT WOULD HAVE BEEN - YES THAT IS LINCOLN HIMSELF POKING THE FIRE - WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT? YES, THE STREETS ARE BLOWN DIRT PATHS FOR HORSES HOOVES AND THINGS ARE DIRTY AND GRUBBY WHERE WOMEN CAN'T KEEP IT AT BAY - TELEGRAGH WAR WIRES RUN INTO THE MIDDLE OF ROOMS TO KEEP INFORMATION FLOWING - IT'S JUST VISUALLY BRILLIANT WITH A FINE PLOT.  LOVE SALLIE FIELD TRANSFORMED EXQUISITELY INTO MARY TODD LINCOLN
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, A LOT.  The second and third books were let downs, though.  I know other people like them, so maybe it was just me.  Definitely worth a shot if you like teenage dystopian books (hunger games, divergent, etc).
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show if far better than most of the shows on TV now. Something other than all the reality junk on TV.
B00009P1O2|4.0|it did what it said on the cover,the quality of picture and sound were top notch,i'll have to start a collection.............
B009NY43NY|4.0|Loved the book. I zipped right through, but I really hoped for a vampire happy ending and I am still hungry for more.
B00280LYHS|5.0|One of the best books ever written and is still amazing me every time I re-read this book now this was epic
B004RUF9DC|5.0|What I found most profound about this movie is how it took me right to the time of Jesus, as if I were there. It's a long movie, and it's also slow, but the experience one gets from the movie is remarkable and well worth viewing. Incredible photography and scenery and blu-ray makes the experience all that much better. Gives the viewer a real, spiritual journey.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|A well structured guide for personal and professional improvement through change.  Based on brain science and an enhanced understanding of how people think.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A marvelous film, extremely well done. Beautiful photography, scenery, and some of the best acting you are likely to see on film. It's not just a film, it's an experience. See it!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Without spoiling the big thing about the villain, I cannot specify what is derivative about it, except to say that several moments in the film are pretty blatantly derived from other Star Trek films.  Despite this, it doesn't at all interfere with the film and its storytelling as a whole (save for one moment involving Spock's scream near the end.  I couldn't not burst out laughing).<br /><br />Despite the derivations along those lines, the film makes the story and characters its own, as well as beautifully altering certain character's personalities based on the alternate universe events, while maintaining their original Star Trek personalities (particularly with the villain).<br /><br />Some action scenes border on the gratuitous, but even in those (such as the one with the Klingons), its purpose serves the plot (in demonstrating the villain, particularly when Kirk starts punching him).  About the only thing that stood out as pointless was having Carol Marcus (played by Alice Eve) strip to her underwear while changing into an environment suit.  At the very least, she told Kirk to look away, and the shot we get is when he looks anyway.  Gratuitous, yes, but a far stretch to call it misogynistic.<br /><br />I would certainly rate this above First Contact, but not sure if it reaches to the level of Wrath of Khan.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|And then move right on to the second in the series featuring Will Robie, good-guy hit man, &#34;The Hit&#34;. Even better.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Something different, but really was a great book! Can't wait to start with number 2! Starts slowly, but once you get to know the characters, there's no stopping.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I was referred to this book by an actual hacker doing time in Washington State. He told me to read it to get a feel for what a hacker feels when he conquers a system. After reading Daemon, I feel that...in spades!<br /><br />Intelligently, perhaps presciently written, Daemon will leave you wanting more.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Myth and legend<br />Ancient British History<br />King Arthur story and timeline<br />This wonderful book is one you can read and re-read; it's full of beauty and wisdom.<br />To borrow from the original cover,&#34;Reading it is at times an uncanny experience&#34;.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed reading this book.  Somethings were very technical but they gave credibility<br />to the story.  Excellent read and  well written
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This is an adult only show, I like the action and the fast moving of the show. It has very good actors in the rolls.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Works has it should. Button a little hard to find. Plastic outer case moves over it side sometimes. Other than that, good tool.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I liked this series better during the first season.  Season 2 was more confusing as it moved rapidly between times and worlds.  It was hard to keep track of the story.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Very predictable and did not leave much to the imagination.  I feel that you know where they are heading with the plot.  Not a good movie.  I was expecting a little more.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You guys really need to update your apps in a timely fashion. Play Store is up to version 3.2.1 on my phone. Amazon you are so slow to release an update for apps.
B003XFVSTG|5.0|This movie is artsy and very creative! If you pay close attention, you will see a love story unfold that will touch even the coldest of hearts. Wonderful movie and well made!!
B0082Z447U|1.0|Had heard so much about this book,completely turned off when author wanted the reader to appreciate women's charms as if all the readers were men. &#34;The first time you saw a woman&#34;.  Yuck.  Also boorish describing a woman as ugly.  Couldn't finish it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Think this is a great game. fun for children and adults, even something great to do together. All together a great application.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are so well cast and highly believable.  The early twentieth century mores and customs are very well displayed.  Its romance, mystery, suspense and real-life issues all wrapped up in a spectacular season of viewing. Even my husband is hooked on the series!!!!
B005MMYPIE|5.0|Its finally been done. Rock metal music which incorporates smart arrangements- hooks- melody- best of best musicianship- annnd three distinctly different vocalists.<br />You could call this popular metal but that does a dis-service to this band. This is not teen pop it is what I have looked for since the 90's.<br />This is hardcore rock- metal but with actual commercial value mixed with instrumental and vocal mastery.<br />My wife even liked this \\"except for the screamy guy\\".
B0035JNRXU|5.0|As with almost all of the Star Trek movies, this one definitely doesn't disappoint. Would recommend and would watch again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love the game. LOTS of fun. Good for all age groups. Would highly recommend it. The graphics are good. Easy to learn. Good clean fun. Great for families.
B00C061I3K|5.0|For background, I was born at the tail-end of the '80s music experience, but the oldies stations were my link to '60s-'80s music (thanks to my family), so I'm familiar with music of these two decades this album covers stylistically. I've also been a fan of Daft Punk since seeing the \\"Digital Love\\" video on MTV2 and the subsequent Toonami: Midnight Run Special Edition show that covered the first third of Discovery & Interstella 5555.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the duo to go so far as to make an album that went back to their influential roots, covering the '70s & '80s so hard... until I heard \\"Get Lucky\\". They did a damn good job experimenting with their sound on this album by going back in time, instead of having to out-pace Dave Guetta, Skrillex or Deadmau5 with another good French house album. In fact, I went into the album thinking for each track \\"okay, which part of the two decades would be the backdrop for this one?,\\" and then think about which song from then does this sound like (case in point, I thought of \\"I Keep Forgetting\\" while listening to \\"Beyond\\" the third time through).<br /><br />Here's what I think, for all the straight-up EDM fans out there that feel disappointed in this album: Daft Punk may very well have set themselves up to come back with another strong house album down the line and mix the experiences from Random Access Memories, and in doing so, tell the EDM artists of the day \\"did you really think that your electronic music is all there is to the overarching genre?\\" and give them an example of how much more there is to it... again. Good album, great experience and experimentation, and it leaves me looking for a transcendent EDM/house album from them in the future. I give it 5 stars since 4 1/2 is what I would really give it, but put on the other half because I think this album can be really influential for some time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|who knows how much money I have lost playing this game while I should have been working.  too fun.  probably the best free driving game you could get.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie because the previews looked AMAZING. However, once I actually watched it I was disappointed, and a bit offended.<br /><br />I live in South Carolina, the setting of the movie. I was born and raised here and in my 31 years I have only ever met 3 people in SC who sound like the people in this movie, and even us native South Carolinians think they're extreme. Why do people who aren't from the south always think we all sound like a bunch of crazed, bible thumping, hillbillies? The inaccuracies abound in this caricature of small town southern life.<br /><br />Overall I think the story had great potential but was ultimately overshadowed by the over reaching of the acting.<br /><br />My advice would be to try again, and this time hire a local adviser/consultant who actually IS what your actors are trying so desperately to portray.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Works great on multiple platforms -Galaxy Vibrant, ASUS T300.  Keep the virtual tape in memory, and the memory value even after closed.  Interface is simple, easy to read, and work in both any orientation.  The only basic calculator I need!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I read the first two books in the trilogy and couldn't wait for the 3rd one.  I was disappointed  in the last book as the story line seem to go off track and the ending was a big letdown!!!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Hark! A kindred spirit! I am a nearly 30 year old female and feel like this gay man is reading my thoughts.  It did inspire me to try to quit smoking again.  This book is a much needed diversion from everyday bores. Anyone who has a slightly twisted and dark sense of humor will appreciate the laughs.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is AWESOME. I think it should be recommended for all ages. It's best game in the whole world. Who would want to stop playing it.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Cute fun movie, I enjoyed it, as a chill out 'chick flick', very amusing, I'm sure a new (and old) Mom'll appreciate some of the humor in it.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I loved this book, and I specially enjoyed the reincarnation theme. A book like this requires attention and intelligence, a love of language and a fascination with stories. Another author that I really enjoy is Adriana Koulias, she writes about similar themes, bringing in history and exploring reincarnation. If you like this try reading The Sixth Key. Books like this are like playing three dimensional chess, it is a challenge but who doesn't like a challenge?
1616550414|5.0|i've been a fan of the Legend of Zelda series for years, and i was hoping for a translation for months before the English version was announced. i preordered it, and i even benefitted from Amazon's price match thing. it arrived a couple days after the first copies got shipped, and it's a great book.<br /><br />it has a few translation errors, but so do the games, so who cares.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I avoid most games of this type because they are difficult to play on the small screen but this one is an exception. It installed well and plays well.  I still am having to learn some of the time matches but it seems to be and easy curve.  Thanks for a good app.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Very good movie !  Better than what I thought it would be. Josh  I love him since he was on All my Children
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I use this one and I like it.  The only complaint is that it is hard to watch the videos and do the exercises at the same time. It is well organized and works good.  The exercises all seem to be practical and doable.  I might even consider the upgrade at a later date. Thanks for a good read.
B00BTYU3SK|5.0|This still works great 40 years later.  Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's a film full of smiles and laughs, a lot of heart, but very little sticky sweetness.<br /><br />A low level grifter (Ryan O'Neal) gets stuck with taking a tough as nails orphaned 9 year old (O'Neal's real ' life daughter Tatum, in an astonishing performance for a kid that age - she really deserved the Oscar she won) home to relatives.  Along the way they get into all sorts of misadventures, and meet numerous characters, including a wonderfully funny Madeline Kahn as an exotic dancer named &#34;Trixie Delight&#34;, and John Hillerman doing his usual excellent low key work in a double role as a bootlegger and his sheriff brother.<br /><br />Bogdanovich gets to the essence of what was best about 30s comedies, without being a slave to it.  He moves the camera, plays scenes in very long single takes, and isn't afraid to mix the best of more modern film making styles into the best of the old.<br /><br />One of those comedies you can watch over and over again.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to have a region free blu-ray player (and if you love films I'd say you should consider getting one), the imported &#34;Masters of Cinema&#34; blu-ray really brings out all the amazing photography in ways the DVD just can't do.
B0001I55SS|5.0|The technology and special effects are great!  Man's quest to find out to what is in the great unknown of space in this case what's in and about the black hole.  And throw in space's answer to Captain Nemo of space masterfully by Maximilian Schell.  The characters acting made it so believable I was on the edge of my seat.  Of course true to the form of Disney, the bad guys get it in the end.  And it's Not boring!  Especially the twists and turns of the story.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Although I loved Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma for its quirky humor, I really enjoyed this version of the story better.  The additional back-story at the beginning is appropriate and sets the stage nicely for entanglements that come later.  And the developing romance between Knightly and Emma is tender and believable.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|My Mom's fav of all time!  Streisand was never better, especially if you tried, for what every crazy reason (acting alone) to compare it to Yentl!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Extremely well acted and a compelling script ....<br />However it is an adult soap opera, but a very good one.<br /><br />You may want to consider using the sub-titles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well first I had fun with minecraft on the pc until my brother told me about this game I've been having so much fun with it.after the latest update 0.7.0 or 0.6.2 is coming so I can't wait for it to come when it will have servers like pc! Overall this app is a great substitute for playing minecraft on the go so you should get this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find it very handy since I'm always on my Kindle and need to do some calculating.  It's very clear and fast.
B00846REIS|5.0|Some might say quite a lot of similarities between FSOG and this book, but I sincerely believe the story line of BTY is so much more. I couldn't keep this book down. Every free minute I had, I was picking it up. A good read.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Stop the arguing, his voice is not auto-tuned. However, it is heavily glossed over. All the beautiful tremor and flicks between phrases in his voice have been almost completely rubbed off in the mixing. Also, it seems too compressed throughout; claustrophobic, like there's no space in the tracks for them to breathe. I feel bad because you always hear him in interviews talking about how he records the band and vocals live in studio, which is great, but if you're not going to mix it right, what's the point?<br /><br />Is it just me or is his songwriting getting worse? \\"Everything\\" and \\"Lost\\" were beautiful, but  now his songs seem so trite. \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" is far too cliché for my taste, it even borrows directly from Duke Ellington's \\"Do Nothing Til You Hear From Me\\" and other crooner music. It's like he's trying too hard to be a classic song man when he doesn't need to. He's been writing with the same person the whole time, so I think he needs to work with someone new once in a while to freshen things up and get his touch back.<br /><br />Buble's arrangements have always been highly stylized, but usually they vary  in theme inside each album. This one seems to stick to an overwrought Nelson Riddle 60's variety show approach for the whole record. I saw his Christmas specials and I appreciate that he's trying to bring back that Perry Como, mid-century aesthetic, but it doesn't translate well in this recording.<br /><br />I'm highly disappointed with \\"Something Stupid.\\" His voice doesn't mesh with Reese Witherspoon's as well as I'd hoped, and the heavy-handed modern beat isn't woven with the usual big band well at all. It would have served the song much better have a simpler arrangement that focused more on the flamenco guitar work. That being said, \\"Come Dance With Me\\" is fantastic, vintage Buble.<br /><br />In short, Michael Buble should get David Foster back at the helm as producer, fire whoever mixed this, and write songs with someone else for a while. I hope this is just a fluke, because I love Michael's previous work. Better luck next time, Buble.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one amazing and suspenseful read.  Not knowing much about North Korea and wanting to learn more in light of the latest news, I bought this book on Kindle.  The author, after doing much research and combining information from real interviews with his imaginative style has created an epic story.  It is the story of one man's self realization and growth from harrowing circumstances to discovery and love.  This is a love story, but not a romantic one.  It becomes the ultimate love story in the absolute dying of oneself for another.  As Americans, the life style imposed on the North Koreans is difficult to imagine, but it is woven into this novel until the realization becomes all too stifling to comprehend.<br /><br />Adam Johnson deserves the Pulitzer.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I saw this in theaters, and I couldn't shake it for weeks. The person I saw it with HATED it because she didn't get it. But I thought was incredible. I found the message compelling and potent. The visuals were beautiful. The changing of race/genders of the actors was not always believable but sometimes it was--- and I can suspend disbelief when it is done to make a solid point. I bought it a few days ago and watched it twice. I think it might be one of the best movies I've seen, honestly. It's too long and complex to ever be considered a classic at some point in the future. But very innovative, both the story, and the way it was shown.

0553386794|1.0|300 pages into this book, I do not see any spectacular plot and likable character. I hold the belief that a fantasy fiction should still be about story telling and character development. One of the beauty of fiction is its ability to condense the daily trivia into remarkable incidents. This book have yet to surprise me in any coincidence the author have setup. Another essential element of fiction is constructing distinctive characters. So many characters the author have introduced, I have not found anyone strong enough to be distinctive. The author spent much effort on world buildup. However, I found nothing especially different from the general fantasy lores. The only reason that has kept me reading this far is the author's excellent mastery of words. How beautiful the words is, the soul is empty. There is no plot that has catched me, and there is no character that has me worried.<br /><br />Worlds is constructed, but not splendid. Plot is setup, but no extraordinary tentions. Character is developed, but none of them is memorizable. Somebody may argue that the real world is lackluster. But novel is no real world. Novel is love, struggle and confrontation. 300 pages give me nothing. So, this is not my book.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|The kids will also enjoy it, was looking for a family movie because now a days even family movies have bad taste and is questionable but Shaun the Sheep is funny & good for all ages, I watched all the episodes.....and I'm 50.....lol!!

B000002OMN|4.0|The first thing I noticed about this album is the title makes it seem as though it is a movie soundtrack.  You just simply don't see many album titles that suggest so blatantly that this is a follow-up to the first.  But, in a way, this encapsulates what I get from Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman's collaboration:  cinematic/operatic imagery that simply does not exist elsewhere in such an extreme.  Therefore, I believe that thinking of this album as one would think of a film sequel is appropriate.<br /><br />The great sequels explore the same world as the original, while introducing new ideas.  The worst sequels are blatant cash-ins on the original, delivering little (if anything) new while mindlessly repeating what made the first film great.  I am pleased to say that this album is a great sequel.  Jim Steinman himself said of this album:  \\"I wanted to do a continuation {of the first Bat Out of Hell} and I wanted to do an album that went even further and that was more extreme.\\"<br /><br />This album takes the unique style of the first album and lets it by informed by the 15 years that had occurred between the two albums.  The production is quite different.  The first album had more of a Phil Spector influence, but critics often speak of THIS album as having \\"stadium rock\\" influence, which one can definitely hear on tracks like \\"Life Is a Lemon,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through,\\" \\"Good Girls Go to Heaven,\\" and even the epic track \\"I Would Do Anything For Love,\\" for which this album is known.<br /><br />The subject matter on the album is also quite different in that it is much more serious.  The first album definitely had its share of seriousness, but you won't find humorous songs like \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" and \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" on this one.  Instead, we find songs that are more reflective.  \\"It Just Won't Quit\\" is about being stirred sleepless by thoughts that you don't understand, \\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror\\" is about profound (often scarring) experiences in the past that are still present in who we are, and \\"Life Is a Lemon\\" is an ode to cynicism.  All of these songs are essential Meat Loaf tracks and real triumphs for Jim Steinman.<br /><br />The album's biggest flaw, however, is that some of these tracks overstay their welcome.  The two short tracks aside, the average track length on this album is 7:45.  \\"I Would Do Anything for Love,\\" for example, is 12:00.  I need to be clear that this is NOT a boring song.  It begins with Todd Rundgren's trademark guitar-generated motorcycle sounds before an awesome piano-led instrumental vamp that will keep you quite invested for the first 2 minutes, and then Meat Loaf's vocals enter with a very sweet, gothic, and epic melody.  The rest of the song has its share of variety, what with tempo changes, instrumental breaks, and a duet.  The song gets repetitive once we hear the second chorus at the slower tempo and then as it goes back to the faster tempo, we hear the chorus again.  At this point, we're ready for something very new to happen, but we don't ever get it.  As much as I hate to say it, I think this song benefited from some cuts for airplay.<br /><br />\\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror\\" is 2nd longest, at about 11 minutes.  This has the same issues as \\"I Would Do Anything For Love.\\"  It's a standout on the album, for sure, and it has a lot of variety in it, but not enough to justify it's length. Were it not for the length (and the awkward lyric \\"If life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car\\"), it would be my favorite.<br /><br />To be sure, Steinman CAN write longer songs that keep one invested the whole way through.  Take the track \\"Back Out of Hell\\" from the first album; it's almost 10 minutes long, but there's way more happening to justify the length:  instrumental intro, 2 or 3 different sections (as opposed to traditional verse-chorus formula).  On Bat Out of Hell II, however, the songwriting is a little less complex, which is fine, but then there's not as much need for lengthy tracks.<br /><br />Despite this, I highly recommend this album.  The songwriting and orchestrations are interesting and well-crafted, the musicians sound fantastic, Meat Loaf's singing is dramatic and evocative, and the vibe of this album has the theatrical experience of the first while not being a complete rehash.  Anyone who wants to explore Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman should definitely check this out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So impressed with this season and the series as a whole!! I laughed, cried, jumped, and just truly love this show. It's worth it!

B003VANOFY|4.0|In general this headset is good.But I found if I play in wireless mode- sometimes they became intermittent straight from the first day. I bought it for playing BF3 multiplayer and loosing sound for couple seconds -means respawn. Wireless transmitter was located on the front panel of my PC, therefore the distance between it and headset is small enough and there is no any obstructions.Fortunately this headset works good when USB cord connected. I needed to buy wired version instead, but may be for essential things like watching movies they are good. I'd recommend this headset for everyone who wants to listen to a music while walking  in the room or watching video from PC , lying on sofa, but for multiplayer gamers it's better to  find wired version
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book portrays different character's lives through their deaths and children.  It offers us insight into the bonds of family, connections which continue through the passage of time, including war and struggle for love, independence, and to rid oneself of poverty.  Highly recommended.

B004J4WNL2|3.0|There is likely value to reminding us that we tend to be a culture that erringly values the extrovert in all situations, and to be reminded that introverts bring a whole new set of strengths sorely lacking in business, government and society as a whole. I kept wanting to read more insightful vignettes of well known introverts and how they survived and conquered in their lives. That would have far more appealing than research facts.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|There was a lot of good information in this book...I learned a great deal about how and why many previous cultures failed or succeeded.  He spent too much time, in my opinion, trying to connect the dots with global warming.  He did cover several topics I had not read before and he is an interesting writer.  I think most people would enjoy it.
B00985E3UG|3.0|This book is a business case study of several large American processed food companies, such as Kraft, Kellogg, General Mills, and a few others.  Each of the three sections starts with a discussion of the role of the ingredient (salt, sugar, fat) in processed foods and the history of the companies' marketing efforts.  A good book for a history of the food industry, not for dieters.

As other people have said, it can probably go faster, but I don't have any faster SD cards to test.<br /><br />If you're using Windows 8 you'll need to download and install the driver from Transcend's website.  The driver download will unzip to a folder you specify.  After that you can either choose to run the installation software, or do as I did and manually update the driver through device manager, and point it to the installer directory for Windows to find the drivers.  Windows will whine about a restart being needed, but I was able to unplug the device and insert it again to start using it.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Thought provoking and illuminating.  Not a &#34;light&#34; read at all.  But - arrgh; how as a species can we be so incompetent?  After reading this book: given all the cognitive biases we are prone to, it is a wonder we manage to stumble through life at all.  The learning from this book, if taken to heart and applied, can help us make far wiser decisions, maybe avoid some of those awful missteps we all make in life, and later regret. I'm a marketing researcher, and this can be applied to many aspects of marketing (advertising messages, pricing, and more).
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this! I mean, loved it. It's written entirely from Drew's pov, and he is honest and hilarious and a little douchey at times, but he owns it and I couldn't get enough of him. There were so many great lines and I was laughing and cringing and then laughing again. The style was...perfect, perfect for the story, for the voice, what an excellent character! I felt him, his honesty was refreshing, a guy that actually talks and thinks like a guy. A quick read, with good, realistic characters that you appreciate and root for despite their flaws. A must read!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I'm not a expert movie critic like some of those on here so I'll just stick to the basics.  The acting was good, story line was entertaining, good action, suspense from beginning to end, and at the end of the movie I felt pleasantly entertained. I'm not much of a Sean Penn fan so that almost kept me from watching it but my wife actually talked me into it and I'm glad she did.  She really enjoyed the flick as well so all in all a good choice.

B00BOXZAG6|3.0|\\"What if love was stronger then gravity.\\" Adam (Sturgess) and Eden (Dunst) have been friends since they were kids. They only thing that keeps them apart is gravity. The world they live in has two separate gravities and they live in two separate \\"worlds\\". After an accident leaves Adam thinking Eden is gone he moves on with his life. After seeing Eden on TV one day he decides to risk everything by finding her again. This is a movie that is very hard to explain without giving anything away. I have said that I'm tired of the same 5 movies being remade over and over again with nothing original coming out. This is one of the most original and visually stunning movies that I have ever seen. The only downside I have with this movie is that they seemed to spend more time on the effects then the actually story. While the story is really good it does seem to drag and repeat itself a few times but overall I would recommend this. Overall, worth seeing and one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen, very neat effects. I give it a B.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I rented this hoping it would at least have some of Arnold's humor but I found the movie to be void of humor, not interesting and with no character development. It must have been written by and for teenage boys. Why this had 5 stars in reviews is a mystery.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Young Bilbo is visited by Gandalf. He is invited on an adventure as he is very adventurous (for a Hobbit). After declining the offer he will be visited by a variety of characters and is coerced into a life of a burglar. Will he survive this life and will we after going on the journey with them? Watch and find out.<br /><br />This is the beginning of \\"There and back again\\" not worth viewing until you have the complete story in hand.<br /><br />The story starts off with a token view of our original beloved characters by the original actors. An observation is that the story starts out excruciatingly slow and takes a good chunk of time to get off the ground. Yet this may be on purpose as with any movies it is best to introduce the characters about to take the journey and their Hobbits... Oops their habits.<br /><br />For people that are interested in technology as much as the story presented it may be premature to purchase anything for a while until all the different versions are sorted out. We already have Blu-ray and digital. And by the time you find this review probably 3D so we can watch a lame rabbit sled. Then there is the denser version of Blur-ray, probably another try of smell-o-vision, seat bottom vibrations, interactive-conversations, etc.<br /><br />Avoid using rental services as they are using the crippled (missing all the DVD extras) rental version of the DVD.<br /><br />I can easily go two ways on this presentation. First it tries to fit the general feel of the LOTR movies and the \\"Hobbit\\" book which is really different in character. So this is more of a LOTR prequel.<br /><br /> Having a lot of the same actors helped with consistency, as always we must have new actors; yet that splits the viewers into the two camps of one's following the story and the other's saying this is not the same actors (good or bad). I suggest that it is worth a viewing to decide for yourself.<br /><br />I personally am glad to have had a shot at seeing this now and will again later after the second half is finished.ter after the second half is finished.

B000K1WP6G|5.0|Yet the writing is so full that we can feel part of this other world.<br /><br />I came to this story by the back door. My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.<br /><br />Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers.  This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge]]<br />[[ASIN:6303333079 Razor's Edge [VHS]]]

B0087ITBPC|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Out of all of the movies I've seen this past week I think this is the one that I expected to like the least. On the contrary, I found the The Guilt Trip to be really, really enjoyable. More enjoyable, in fact, than I ever would have expected it to be. This film's strongest attributes are its charm and relatability. Everyone knows what it's like to have a mother, but this film focuses a lot on the mother/son relationship (obviously). Now I love my mother to death, but there's just something about moms where sometimes they don't know when to stop and we don't know how to tell them that they're being overbearing until we snap. I think this film does a good job of focusing on this concept and the Rogen/Streisand duo do a great job of bringing that relationship to life.<br /><br />The premise is simple really. You follow Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen), a struggling inventor of a new, organic cleaning product. He has to go across country to try and sell this product to big companies in hopes that they will be willing to distribute it in large quantities. Once he learns a secret from his mother Joyce's (Barbra Streisand) past he invites her to come a long. The only thing is she thinks that business is good and he doesn't want to tell her otherwise because he doesn't want her worrying about him. She accepts and you spend the remaining 60-70 minutes following these two across their week-long road trip.<br /><br />As a whole I thought the story was enjoyable, nothing groundbreaking, but it was charming and full of laughs. Upon doing some research I found out that Streisand was nominated for \\"Worst Actress\\" for this film. 1) I didn't even know that was a thing and 2) I think that's a bit of an overstatement. Streisand is in no way Academy Award material, but it would be wrong to deny that she and Rogen have fantastic chemistry on screen. In a movie like this you need two actors who can emulate that mother/son relationship and these two did it perfectly.<br /><br />This is what ultimately what makes this film enjoyable. We can relate to what is going on in these scenes because we've all been there in some form or another. Maybe it wasn't on a road trip, but the conversations and arguments that are had in this movie are the same ones had by other mother/child relationships daily. The funniest scenes in here are the ones where this dynamic is shown in full force. For example, because she's with him on this road trip she has to go into the buildings with him when he has his meetings. While they're waiting she's rummaging through her purse, making a bunch of noise, playing loud games on her phone, and wishing him good luck as he's walking away. I think it's one of those things that no matter how old you get you're always going to feel slightly embarrassed by your mother.<br /><br />The casting is relatively small in here. The focus is mainly on Rogen and Streisand so don't expect to see a huge group of familiar faces. Most of the supporting cast comes and goes in a matter of minutes. However, there are two other characters who play a pretty major role in the story. Without giving away their roles you have Brett Cullen playing Ben Graw and Adam Scott playing Andrew Margolis, Jr. Still, even these two are only in here for maybe three minutes each. Because Rogen and Streisand are the main focus their performances could make or break the film. Luckily they both did a solid job. Rogen is back with another semi-serious role and I think I'm starting to enjoy seeing this side of him. Streisand, as previously mentioned, wasn't exceptional, but she played her part well and that's all that matters.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - Depending on who you are there's a lot of fun to be had in The Guilt Trip. It's one of those rare comedies that doesn't force itself to stray into \\"dirty\\" humor just for an easy laugh. Instead, it's more heartfelt and I think that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did. It's charming and fun without being aimed at children and I think it'd be nice to see more comedies like this. If this film was on your radar but you missed it in theaters then I would say watch it. It's a fun comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome and it's entertaining from start to finish.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great acting, intelligent dialog, compelling plot, amazing cinematography, beautiful scenery.  What's not to like about this terrific series?

B00AGKHFCA|5.0|Mr. Bocelli is an accomplished singer with a voice that is both powerful and beautiful. There are so many excellent songs on this CD. Many are updates from songs released decades ago. Andrea Bocelli has used his incomparable voice to breathe new life into songs many will recognize almost immediately. Others will hear former standards and understand why those songs became standards.The exceptional arrangements only enhance the beauty of the musical offerings in this collection.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's more interesting than other similar games. I can't stop playing especially when I just watched the movie last night.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love relaxing with this game. It is a great way to end a stressful day. It is easy to use on my Kindle so I can play any time
B001UTW7QU|5.0|JJ Abrams SciFi... five stars! JJ Abrams, writer and producer,  provides the viewer with good story telling and interesting themes.  This is not campy science fiction at all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All I can say- well, as they say, less is more-  is that this is one of the best apps ever, and for the best price, too - FREE! !!!!!!!!!!!!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The third season of 'Fringe' continues to deliver that same mix of almost-too-unbelievable plot lines with 'I wonder what happens next'. Despite a few seeming continuity mix-ups in a few episodes the actors continue to make you believe in the bizarre happenings the series develops so well. We are well into the fourth season and I am anxious to see how they wrap up that season.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use it for so many things: grocery list, task list, important account numbers (I password protect these files), Lists of recommended books, restaurants, TV shows, movies, even URLs.  I can see/update it on my phone, my tablet and my computer.  I have even shared it with my husband by sending an email
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|....unreal.  My 4 year old daughter and wife are both singing along.  Rarely has an album seemed some prescient and also timely.  Last time a disk was on loop like this was OK Computer.  Says something...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Okay so I watched this 6 times in a row last Saturday.  I loved it!!! Having Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough doesn't hurt either.  These two look like they should be a real life couple they have such amazing chemistry. So I am not usually a mushy romantic movie person I find the unrealistic and predictable. This. Movie had me glued from the moment it started. Julianne Hough's character is abused woman on the run and she winds up in this little sea tourist town. She decides to stay and starts her life over as Katie.  Josh's character is a widower with two adorable kids.  The two character's met and of course fall in love.  Of course &#34;Katie's&#34; character's past shows up and threatens to ruin her new life and we have the predictable show down at the end.  But there is a twisted at the very end I never saw coming and it gave me chills.  I just  have to say I truly love this movie and would recommend it to all to watch it. Over and over again.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Interesting perspective of the life of a Viking as a citizen, as a family man and as a warrior. Scandinavian countries had it hard to survive and make a living. Robbing and killing was a way of life as bad as it may seem. Interesting action packed.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Don't let the previews fool you, this is not a light hearted comedy.  This movie is a serious look at mental illness and how it effects all who have a loved one dealing with it.  Bradley Cooper is amazing in this role his layers of this character keep you totally glued to the movie.  Jennifer Lawerence is also amazing she is really coming into her own and showing she has what it takes to transform from teen star to grown up film icon.  Their chemistry is amazing, you find yourself rooting for these two misfits to get together. It does have very funny parts with lots of flawed characters who you make you wonder if they should be medicated as well.  Oh and there is Robert De Niro as well.  By the end of the movie you find yourself happy and at peace with how things will turn out.  It is so worth your time to watch  it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A friend suggested this book. She was right, I kept reading because I just needed to know what did and was happening. I never could have predicted the end.
B000I9B6VK|5.0|Great movie with great soundtrack, funny, meaningful. Must buy the separate soundtrack CD in order to get the full effect of the music.
B000R4SMD6|4.0|Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present.  She was pleasantly surprised.  Thank you for having such variety at such good prices.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Insight into what type of people become famous for their accomplishments. Tesla was truly remarkable. His science was always more important than his rewards. Very interesting read. Much more than a biography.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite movies so he was greatly pleased when he received this as a gift.
1595826971|5.0|If you're a big fan of the game, then you will not want to pass this up.<br /><br />This really dives into the game. You'll get to read and view how the process went in creating this beautiful game. You get art, notes, and a forward by Mr. McGee himself.<br /><br />The art is amazing, and you'll probably find yourself staring at a pages for long periods of time. I did anyway. They show you the many ways levels were originally created, and how Alice was suppose to look before they changed it. You get to see art pieces of things that were suppose to be in the game, but didn't make the final cut.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the game, or just a fan of art in general. This is a must own.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|My sons, father and I went to see this in the movies and my father enjoyed it a great deal.  He turned 81 today and I wanted him to have it to watch at home whenever the mood strikes him.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This series is very graphic and shows plenty of violence, along with a lot if sexual innuendo.  However, the story lines are character-driven so the plot is truly engaging. The writers found a clever way to show contrasts between the Viking culture and the more familiar English, which helps to prevent desensitization to the violence.<br />This is  definitely not a show for kids.<br />I can't wait for the new season!
B00008G7UJ|4.0|This is from my daughter's grade school years.....and it was a surprise to her when I bought it as a gift.  I was glad to see it at a good price as well.
B001HN6918|5.0|If you liked Kung Fu Panda, then you will certainly love this one too. Most sequels in my opinion usually don't live up to the big first movie, they are just another money magnet for the film makers, but not this movie. Kung Fu Panda 2 is just as good as the first and you hope that the makers will keep right on writing and create more. All the original cast voices are still in this one too so that's another plus in my book. I also have very picky boys and if they don't like a movie it sits on the shelf and collects dust, however I think they have worn ruts in the dvd like we ole timers did with our favorite records. We watch this with the 4 and 8 year old and enjoy it as much as they do. We got it quickly after ordering and were and still are very happy.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Thought it was very good. would recommend it to all. Really explained a lot of things that led up to the events in the other movies.
B000J233SK|5.0|I had this long ago but it got destroyed by a nosy baby(mine) and didn't think I'd ever be able to find it again, BUT here I am reviewing it years later. I had forgotten just how wonderful Loreena's voice was and how she manages to incorporate real stories of real cultures and peoples into her music. Saw her once on tv and she really takes alot of time and genuine effort studying and researching before she just pops another song out there hoping that everybody who's on her band wagon will continue to buy. Her music IS NOT like alot of so called stars today, she is quite a unique individual with such an amazing voice, my husband even likes alot of the music on this and was thrilled I found it here. The Murmmers Dance is soothing and enchanting, while Marco Polo is slightly seductive sounding. Enough so that I have been using it to belly dance. I can't say that I have any complaints of her music and it's not all just one boring style either, it is a little bit of this and that and enough to get you hooked. If you've never heard music varity in an artist you will with this cd and you'll be glad you did. You might even become a Loreena McKennitt junkie. I didn't know she had so many albums til I found this here on Amazon(great work guys!) you opened my eyes. I got this fast and in mint condition and I find that I order so much here cause I haven't had a bad experience and the vendors are great. Thanks to you all!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great fantasy series Brandon Sanderson does a remarkable job of fulfilling Robert Jordans vision. Hats off to all involved with the project and THANKS for the entertainment.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This is a different kind of movie: unusual topic, unusual life, unusual approach. Worth seeing to get a glimpse into a disabled person's life when a brilliant mind is trapped inside a disabled body and strives to experience what everybody else has on a whim - sex.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book!! I love how it is written from the male perspective!! It was incredibly funny and the perfect real romance!!!!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I had seen this in a local theater and enjoyed it. We decided to give it a try as a rerun. It was as enjoyable as the first time. It had the some of the same elements and talent I remember seeing in the movie &#34;Stand By Me&#34;.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|It's been a long time waiting for an awesome martial arts movie. I rated it top honors alongside Ip Man and all of Bruce Lee movies
B00CRW2066|5.0|It used to be the case that I required several listens to fall in love with a new album from The National. No longer. Exquisite craftsmanship.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Loved it on the 70's, love it just as much in 2013! Uncluttered music and Carole's smooth sultry voice. A must have for my generation!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Loved this the first time I saw it when it came out and loved the musical version, Billy Elliot, The Musical.  No one can beat Julie Walters!!  Love her!
B00421IR5I|3.0|Based on the children's book by Rene Goscinny and Jean-Jacques Sempe, this movie reminds us of the foibles of childhood. Nicolas, with his beautiful smile and big blue eyes, immediately captures our hearts.  His life appears perfect with loving parents and great friends.  As children do, he misinterprets his parent's actions and conversations creating numerous hilarious situations. A delightful family movie.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Kept me interested all the way. I will buy more of the series. These works are up there with the work of W.E.B. Griffin Ken Follet
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This book never was slow, their was ALWAYS something else going on. It's kind of creepy too but in a good and entertaining way:)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great flick, brought me back to when I used to play in the arcade.  Loved to see some of the classic characters.  I think everyone will love it, all my kids did!
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Deep Purple still rocks with ambition and intelligence. I believe this release is their best since &#34;Purpendicular&#34;! Don Airey's keyboards are quite good and echo many of Jon Lord's phrasings. Pass it by at your own risk.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This has changed my life.  My words fail me... Driven to succeed in spite of numerous hurdles.  You cannot read this and walk away unchanged.
B00BLYFDO2|1.0|If you thought &#34;Raw Power&#34; was a great record you might give this a passing grade. Why does Iggy return to this brash garage sound? I'm one of those fans who felt that the Arista years were his best. This release is only for those who can't resist their own opinion. Pop is still Michigan's most relevant artists.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Fraction Calculator Plus is the best fraction calculator I have seen. I uninstalled two otber fraction calculators I had previously installed because this one is very intuitive, simple, and easy to use.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is a great movie for those that like WW2 or submarine movies.  I was in my living room sweating along with the crew as they were bombed (depth charges) from above.  A must watch.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Sometimes after watching the first season of a television show I will anxiously look forward to the next season and then when I watch it I'm somewhat disappointed because it just does not live up to what I have been anticipating.  Not so with The Good Wife, Season 2.  It was every bit as good as the first, if not better
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook interface OK.  App does a good job of showing a rather mediocre interface.  Not sure what else to sugtest.
1592332803|5.0|I have tried many vegan recipes, but they never tasted as good as the recipes in this book! I can make ANY recipe from this book and serve it to everyone! Vegans and non vegans will love this book :-)
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is a great app for androids (so you don't have to carry a separate Kindle with you) but I wish I could get an expanded view of the illustrations & pictures.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This program asks for download but web pages still don't open. This download was waste of time and will be deleted.
B0091REZMW|5.0|for something you enjoy.  Full pc games run $30 or more.  Why not drop $10 on a game you are spending hours playing?
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It worked poorly toothbrushes of sound and ease of use much better on iphone. Good that is was free bit it has been deleted off my device.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Most fun I've had reading in ages.  It just pulls you in and your off.  I couldn't read fast enough to satisfy my need for more.  Not really a review as much as a long awaited exhale.<br />Thank you, Mr. Howey!
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius has another success!<br />Love this entire album!every song is good , I think it's perfect summertime music! Worth every penny!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I always enjoy reading a Nelson DeMille book. I found the Panther to be very exciting.<br />Always an exciting read!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Always amaized at what that generation experienced and what conditions existed and developed that resulted in war between similar God fearing people
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I thought it would be more like the TV program.  It was too wordy and hard to follow.<br />There was so much extra\ianous dialogue, I  got lost and could'nt follow the story.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is good but not up to the quality of Gone Girl.  Still worth your time, keeps you guessing until the end.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|This was not my first choice in reading as I'm more focused on fact based true stories or historical fiction.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|If your a fan of &#34;Phantom,&#34; then purchase this live enormous production, so very well done, with a cast of more than 200!!!
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Great concept and very unpredictable movie.  Many frightening parts to this film.  Could have had a better ending.  All in all...worth watching!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This is an extremely well-done production and filming of the sequel to &#34;The Phantom of the<br />Opera!&#34;  Purchase it for yourself.<br /><br />The melodies will haunt you.
159463176X|4.0|Having read both of this authors previous books, I was prepared to like this one just as much. And I did enjoy it, but just not as much as the first two. The author is a master story teller and it shows in every page. This book is not so much about war as it is about heartbreak and hope.  It is about the human spirit, no matter what country. I would recommend you read this one.....though it is still about Afghanistan, it is from a different perspective. Can't wait for this authors next book.
B000BIQKXM|5.0|It's too bad that I discovered Westlife just after they retired!  I own many if their CDs, and recommend them.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Great actors for both men, good story about family. My mom watched it and said, this shows you that your family is all you have in life, so cherish it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! cant stop playing!!! I never have a problem. some games are hard but I still love it!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I've never read any of the books in this series and had no bias towards what the character should look like. I think Tom did a good job as did all the actors in this movie.  I'd watch it again and I'd recommend it.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I love this series because it is always changing and twisting and one never knows what will happen around the corner.
B00BF11UM0|3.0|After all the hype about the Oscars, I'm sorta let down.  I bought this movie to watch on a plane ride and only got halfway through.  Perhaps I need to devote more attention to it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm sad when I finish one of Follett's books. I love the adventures and don't want the stories to end !
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|But it is not the best Die Hard Movie either.  It's a good movie to watch while you're stuck on a plane.  It's why I bought it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I've ordered season 3 and am impatiently waiting for season 4. Let's hope they  get on with it soon.  cheers!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is a awesome show I thank that if you don't buy it you are crazy and Amazon was there every time I bought the wrong episode they gave me my money back staying with Amazon for a long time PS. This show is about 2 brothers who hunt supernatural beings they hunt them because in the show there mom was killed by one and so there dad started hunting supernatural beings and be came so obsessed with getting revenge on the demon that killed his wife he raised his boys to hunt its a vary good show if you read this and u say ummm I don't know about this show just give it a try I believe you will love it
B00973902K|5.0|My grandbaby is 4 yrs old and can sing every word to her song.. its def her favorite.. so i downloaded it for her lol
B00821OX98|4.0|I like it it's not the best scifi but meets basic with some nice emotions and the picture is great
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book actually made me cry, and it aint easy to make &#34;ME&#34; cry lol.. loved it.. keep up the good work nicholas sparks
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting is superb!  The location shooting seems to be appropriate to the times. Good photography! The scenes inside Downton Abbey are beautiful!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This movie kept me on my toes.. my whole family enjoyed it, funny as heck and heartfelt.. kate hudson u rock girl!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|LOVE this controller. Looks and feels like the xbox controller- nice and grippy and much better design. Functions flawlessly. no problems with wireless either. good range. good battery life. Excellent product.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|In typical Tarantino style the violence and gore was way over the top in this movie, but if you love Tarantino you expect this.  Though this is done in an updated Spaghetti Western style with lots of violence and gore, part of the ugly history of slavery is faced in a way that is not meant to make you feel guilty and sad that we have to claim this history, but happy for the Django when he mets out his own justice.<br /><br />At the end of the movie you are disgusted with the practices of some of the worst slave owners and you celebrate that there were a few who didn't agree and could not tolerate the injustice.  Most of all you feel vindicated by the ending.<br /><br />Though Tarantino's story telling you get all the things you would expect and some gritty historical perspective.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Obvious choice for 2013 &#34;movie of the year&#34; at Oscar ceremonies. Great acting and directing by Ben Affleck and all of the cast.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|keeps kindle clean and nice. does what it is meant to do. the white color can get dirty since white gets dirty in general.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I had been planning on adding this dvd to our library since I first saw it. The fact that the movie is in &#34;aramaic/latin&#34; does not detract by Jim Caviezel's fine acting as well as that of the entire cast.
B005XLN97M|4.0|Easy to assemble.Small enough to fit on table.Good beginner house for small children to play with Barbie's in.Door broke on fridge first ten minutes, though could be put back but it was weaker.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I think that it's SUPER ironic that this book is written exactly like the movie &#34;Tangled&#34; is narrated in the beginning and in the end....I found it quite refreshing, it felt as if I was watching a movie instead of reading an actual book...this book was the perfect combination of funny and romantic ..5 Starz all the wayyyyyyy..
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It's not the game that I thought it was. It's an RPG match 3 kind of game, but it works well. I bought it on Steam too after playing it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins.  This is the sequel to the Hunger Games, which I also liked very much.  It's a fairly quick read and keeps you engaged the entire time.  The character development is excellent and it's also action-packed.  I love how the main character, Katniss, undergoes her own periodic self-reflection and acknowledges her own faults.  Many heroes in other books are artificially perfect, which detracts from the authenticity of the story, but the author keeps Katniss real in this case.<br /><br />I loved the new character, Finnick, and thought that the author did a good job presenting him.  Overall, I highly recommend this book as a continuation of the Hunger Games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Outside of the ads before just about every deal, it's solitaire, plain and simple.  great time to waste time.  I recommend it
0307887448|5.0|Do you like geeky?  Are you a fan of dystopian stories?  How well do you know your 80's?  You into video games?<br /><br />Ok to the suggested review content ..<br /><br />What aspects of this work do you like or dislike?<br />- While I liked the characters and the &#34;coming of age&#34; &#34;conspiracy&#34; blended theme, I am a sucker for a story with a good crazy idea.  What if people chose an internet existence over real life ...  Oh, wait a minute ...<br /><br />How has this work impacted you?<br />- I probably lost a days worth of Sys Admin productivity and missed my usual Urban Terror round.<br /><br />What should other customers know when considering this item?<br />- The main characters will probably not be played by Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise.  But then again, I get surprised.<br /><br />What other works would you compare this to?<br />- War Games, Surrogates, Tron, Gamer<br /><br />Well done, I look forward to more.<br />Dave
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I tried it, couldn't deal with the ads everytime I went to another level.  Just wanted to play the game, not look at the ads,  worse than a magazine.  I deleted it
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The game was fun to play. I liked the puzzles and the way it drew me further and further in.<br /><br />The hint system was helpful. In several cases, it gave me a nudge in the right direction without spoiling the game. For instance, I had not realized that the game made use of sensors to determine the tilt of some puzzles.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to have more than one person able to play at the same time. My husband had to wait for me to finish.<br /><br />I did not much care for the occultist feel as the game went on, either. And I hope future games have happier endings.<br /><br />However, I did enjoy the game mechanics and the way it made me look closely and think to solve the puzzles. As several other reviewers have noted, the game did have a Myst-like feel to it, so fans of those games will probably like this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's just like having a Kindle only better.  You can get to your Kindle books and still use your tablet for online use.  The best of both worlds
0385349947|5.0|Great informative book for women of all ages! Teenagers to elder women will likely get a lot of information and motivation to become a confident, independent woman in their career and home life!
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark books are always very good and this on did not disappoint me.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes mystery stories.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is the best ever i have been trying to get it for do long no that i got it i am jumping up and down. Everyone who does not have this game you need it now!!!!!!!! You cant live without it.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|Interesting concept.  Let us focus on our strengths and get better at those rather than working on ohr weaknesses<br /><br />It was an easy read and provides the reader with good insight
B001KYTFS8|5.0|I love Stereophonics and have for many years. This greatest hits collection is awesome. If you are a fan of the band you will also want to have all of their other cd's. Decade In The Sun is a collection of some of their biggest hits. This would be a great cd for someone wanting to check the band out for the first time. If you love this, then you need to check out their other stuff. Kelly Jones is a great song writer. He has a knack for crafting a song that's catchy and get's stuck in your head. If you check out their other cd's you will notice the band loves to cover other peoples songs too. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!! Kelly Jones voice is so unique and distinctive. Love this band!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Been using this since it was free app of the day.  Always have backed up on titanium backup for fast restore. Great job
B00COHAUD4|3.0|If you're looking to pass two hours then go for it, but there are so many holes and jumps in this movie that it really ends up not making any sense. Opening scene really awesome though.
B000GT4H0Y|3.0|The writing and story was fine. But if this movie had a different director it probably would have been miles better. I liked the stylized action and violence. However I didn't like how long the action poses or the one liners took...its like all the action stopped so everyone could stare at the cool action poses or listen to the one liners...then then action resumed. It just came across as dumb. This movie could use a good fan edit and it would probably be alot better.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great lessons to be had in this movie. Actually used this movie to teach a class of 7-12 year olds.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|predictable but a good read none-the-less. I love the setting, and the picture in my mind of the cabins/town are perfect!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game. I think that there should be more games like it because it is so great. It is the best! It is so addicting. I play it everyday! I give it a five star rating because of that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She plays it a lot, but she picked it out, too!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book kept me awake all week!  I couldn't stop reading until late in the night...after a week of exhaustion I'm finally done and can't wait to start Walking Disaster...read this book!  You will be hooked.  Great story of love, trust, heartbreak and redemption.  Jamie McGuire puts so much thought into the story...Beautiful Disaster is BEAUTiFULLY written.
B00B3MN65K|3.0|I've listened to this album once and found it okay.  Not that impressed, but will listen to it<br />again and again to get a better feel for it.
B00B2QG3K2|2.0|Complete disapointment. Can I get my money back ? Oh yea I can't. I'm not a lyrical guy but I did notice they need to find better song writers.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This is an easy read, and she makes some interesting and important points. I liked that everything she says is backed by data/references, and that I could really relate to a lot of what she said. This book has gotten a lot of criticism, which I think completely proves a lot of the points she makes in the book. In my view, the criticism is unwarranted.  Read it and see what you think.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is the best book by any stretch, but if you are interested in the topic, it's definitely worth the time and $.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for the second one to come out. Hopefully it will have many more levels with more rooms and boxes to solve. Awesome mind bender!!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent historical piece, reality based. Those in healthcare should read and see how far we have come in the world of patient advocacy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it brings me back to old school when I played it as a kid. but only a newer version. better than farmville.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Don't play it too much but my son loves the fish and making his own ocean as he states !
B0000TAZBK|5.0|Epic movie, will stand the test of time as a classic. Well made. Outstanding production. Special effects second to none.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This third part of the Clifton Chronicles was really good and best of all, I feel sure there will be a fourth book, which I did not expect.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is EPIC! A must must MUST read! Emma chase is hands on one of the best writers! Tangled got me laughing out loud. Seriously. People who haven't read this or doesn't bother reading this are totally missing out!<br /><br />The way she wrote this book, it gets the reader to part of the story. (confusing? haha! I'm confused myself!)<br /><br />OVERALL, 5 stars!!! I can't wait for the second book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed the author's manner of expression, mixed with a taste of humor. I don't want to give a spoiler...too much to read and experience in this novel. So I'll skip to the end: I especially liked that he ended it leaving something to the reader to determine.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kid loves playing this game he beg me to get this for my kindle n since I have i havent seen much of my kindle since
B007MB5OCE|4.0|So many crazy situations in this book.  Of course it is unbelievable and you have to suspend reality... but it was entertaining nevertheless.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|But I also saw this movie and it is a great movie!  Anthony Hopkins actuation was one of the best of his career.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|You will never go wrong watching any season of Doctor Who. The stories are great and a lot of fun to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it has been months please update and put more monsters and wolves in it but other than that it is great
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Movie kept me interested and had a few twists that I liked. I would definitely watch it again. If you are the type that enjoys suspense and who dun-nit genres this movie is for you. I referred it to all my friends who enjoy psychological thrillers.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I've not finished this book....it just did not grab my interest.  I heard it was very good but not for me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love  this can  it is the best game you could ever play this  game will lead you to a great life of fun.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked this book because it wasn't just a love story.  It is funny and pulls you in to two lives that were lost and well you'll see or read.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|FMJ fans already know how awesome this movie is... It's not a chick flick, and it certainly isn't your grandpa's war movie. With that said, the remastered HD quality is very nice and is definitely worth a few extra coin.
1436119561|4.0|While this book took a little while to get into, I definitely appreciated the build up once the plot began to unfold. Cyberpunk meets alien suppression and exploitation meets assassin meets turning on a chance. Indeed, this tale brought together several tropes and spat out something unique and highly memorable. Told mostly from Andre's point of view, and an interesting view it is, we see his impersonal approach to his job, assassinating folks. He also has a somewhat impersonal approach to his love life with Cricket. But then things change, and get weird, and very cool. The Charter Trade Company wants folks dead, a valuable mineral mined and off planet before anyone notices, and doesn't care who gets injured along the way. That includes a good friend of Cricket's and the Jean's lover.<br /><br />The Rannids are introduced bit by bit giving the reader time to get to know them. They think differently, and hence, their actions don't always make sense to their human overlords. They have no visible sign of advanced civilization, which has left Charter Trade Company legally able to exploit them and remove the planet's resources. But they are far more complex, able to communicate world wide through vibrations in the water, treasuring stories. Humans have many stories in many forms, and so many Rannids learn to read human lips (lacking the natural auditory equipment to hear human speech) in order to enjoy these stories.<br /><br />Jean, in introducing Andre to these planet natives, may not only save Andre's retched existence but also the planet. Jean is a Conjurer, a man who can and does affect chance outcomes. Andre has this latent ability in himself but lacks the training, and the mindset. I found Andre's storyline the most fascinating because he starts off the least human (psychologically) and grows so much as a character by the end of the book. Listening to the culture of the Rannids unfold bit and bit as Andre would learn of them piece by piece kept me coming back for just one more chapter before bed.<br /><br />Timothy Reynolds was a great choice of narrator, giving Andre's voice precision, upper class tones, and that assassin's detachment. His female voices were decent and his Rannid voices were unique from other voices.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Otherwise a badass time killer. Definitely like how I put far too much time into this and they busted the store. Psh.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|The kids loved watching this movie; and us as parents also found ourselves thoroughly entertained with laughter, excitement, and suspense. There was also good lessons for the kids: faith, courage, overcoming obstacles and fears, etc; this was my favorite part about the movie.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|Yeah, I mean he is getting older (arn't we all?) - But his sound is what I remember from my youth.<br />Raw sound that still shows a great artist. Yeah, you need to buy this one.
0446892882|5.0|First released in the early 70's. Thousands of books have followed proclaiming the &#34;Sugar Wars&#34;. But nothing has made a difference. Sugar consumption in the United States has gone from 75 lbs a person (in 1975) to 150 lbs a person in 2013. No one wants to admit we are completed addicted to the stuff. It is everywhere we go and because it is so engrained into our society, we don't even pay attention to it. I was in a stamp and coin shop the other day, and they had a big candy display right by the cash register, and no one thinks that's a little weird. William Duffy suggests that if sugar were to be introduced today, it would never get FDA approval because large doses, (over 50 grams a day) far less than the 1/3 to 1/2 pound Americans eat every day, are toxic.
B000IDEORY|4.0|A great B movie.<br />The finale chokes up even the most cynical viewer.<br />Groan inducing dialogue in places...but all is forgiven...terrific frothy fun.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Strenuous but not great; fades at the end.  What is this nonsense about a required number of words--will not do further reactions.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Whether you are or not familiar with the &#34;Spaghetti Westerns,&#34; this is both homage to those and yet with a fresh take on the Western.  Superb film.  Should have been the #1 movie of 2012.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|The work of Ghandi was world-changing; and this film did the man justice in portraying his lifestyle change and the changes in his direction of life. Then, it does an excellent job of showing us how beautiful this man's heart was toward his fellow man.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Great series. High production values and wonderful actors. Everyone in family is enjoying the series so would definitely give a thumbs up.
B004U8VWIM|2.0|I tried three times to watch it.  I found it boring and depressing, and would not recomment it to anyone.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Being a Moody Blues fan from the early years, this is an exceptional CD!  Compares to the Blue Jays CD from back in the day.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack serves me well. There are some problems with the zipper pullers (they have all broken off) and the material covering one of the straps is stripping. Other than that, the internal compartments, are very useful up to the point I am putting too much in them. The external compartments are the same. This backpack allows you to carry a lot in a small package.<br />I would still buy it as my first/temporary backpack.<br />It allows me to understand what I really need without investing too much.
B009R659L8|4.0|Beginning, Middle, and end.  Very well written.  Well put together.  Complicated but easy to read.  Everyone likes her stories.<br />But just once would be nice if it was just a bit more complicated and not so fluffy.  I don't think I'll read anymore of her books.<br />She is just too bland.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent movie about revenge, justice, and love. Waltz, Foxx, and DiCaprio all played extraordinary roles worthy of awards. Bravo! Entertaining regardless of the amount of times it is watched.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Second season did not disappoint. Same quality throughout. Was very happy with quality of performances and level of design and direction
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Every part of this production is outstanding, sets a mark that can't be even approached by special effect epics and depressingly  gritty 'reality' tales.  Wonderful scripts for every episode, real and touching acting, glorious settings (not set at all), and very moving music, always appropriate and never intrusive.  I've left some things out, I know.  Others can remind us of those.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This game is deceptively simple. It starts off easy but then quickly becomes much more challenging. I've played to level 20 and am starting to feel a little frustrated. The trouble is, there aren't many incentives for solving each level....just more difficulty. Graphics are decent and the game functions smoothly but the story just isn't that interesting or visually appealing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The characters and the overall series tone/plot can not be overstated. If you haven't yet taken a plunge into the verse, don't wait any longer. Once you watch the pilot, you will be hooked!!!
B000FC12YQ|5.0|I've seen the Poirot movies and loved them, but this is the first Poirot story I've read. I wasn not disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Running this on a Galaxy S4 and it works just great.  Like the added pages capability. The app is totally outstanding and it all fits so easily in my pocket.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I would give this game a higher rating, but on my Droid it is so small it hurts my eyes to try to play it.
B00821OX98|3.0|The concept is great!  Ask any sci fi fan.  However, I haven't come to like any characters, so it leaves me a bit empty.  Each show is decent, but the path they are going down seems a bit BS, but I guess that is TV.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Builds on Hunger Games with new suspense, new terrors but also new hope.  What will happen next?!  I can hardly wait!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Even though there is a 24 year difference in our age my son and I just love the Doctor.<br />I've been watching since the early 80's and he has been watching now for about 7 years or so.<br />These last few years have been more action pact than ever but have never lost the humor and fun Dr. Who is known for.
B00B23O96A|5.0|His sound has mellowed but the quality has increased. This album is all it says. I love Eric and the blues. A must have for the Clapton fan
B004MC8CA2|5.0|First time I used this app was to read the Bible in 90 Days.  Did it!  Read most of it and it kept track of my progress, reminded me when I needed to catch-up, then I discovered you can listen too.  So on long drives would listen to the reading for the day.  On top of this you will have many translations to review, not to mention many languages, and it is so easy and instantaneous to switch from one to the other.  Searching for a specific word or phrase is very simple and fast. Finally there are many many plans from which to choose.  Just an outstanding app to keep you connected to your faith.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Like others, I also went in thinking it would be a critique of our over medicated society -- it WAS that and much more. Sodebergh's genius is in weaving several threads so well together: critique, murder, intrigue and situating it in psychiatry, showing that the more things change the more things stay corrupted. So well done. Rooney Mara, I beg you: EAT SOMETHING.
B004GBK09A|5.0|I loved this movie. It has great actors and actresses in it. The movie was incredible and very funny in my opinion.
B009CGADIW|5.0|&#34;The general's wife is the general's general.&#34; Really? She never tells him what to do. As portrayed in the movie she simply worships the man and stands by his every decision!  In a lot of ways that sums up the character of MacArthur.  You win his heart by surrendering unconditionally to him and pledge your eternal loyalty.  Those that follow him to the end will receive his highest accolades.<br />MacArthur left an indelible mark on history because of his unyielding nature, supreme (often over-bearing) confidence, and strategic brillance.  In many ways he represents the best and the worst of Americans.  This movie captures all of these qualities that leave you admiring the man even when you may question his decisions.<br />Gregory Peck should have been nominated for an Oscar for his magnificent performance.  It is easy to see why this film was one of his personal favorites.
B00B935SUY|5.0|More then just a story about all the great albums made at Sound City. It delves into the art and beautiful of making records and art of analog vs digital records.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't believe the continued twists with the character Amy. You loved to hate her and wondered what the next page would bring.  The ending was a surprise - not that I particularly liked it - but like the book, it made you wonder. Sequel?
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this is a very entertaining game. I wish it was longer or could be an ongoing story.I really enjoyed playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is amazing I truly love it I started playing on Xbox and then I heard of the pocket edition and I got it as soon as possible I especially like the controls I thought they would be hard but it only took me seconds to get used to it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book. The book tells the story of Charlie's struggles through his freshmen year of high school.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Usual good read from Michael Connelly. Bosch and Haller make for a very good team put them together more often
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I'm into personal development as a Beachbody Coach and this was the one I was told to start with. Man, was this the perfect one to start with. I love this book and the things it suggests that you do with you life really work if you try them out. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B0079IEPHA|3.0|Each DVD worked only once; couldn't play the 2nd time - DVD wouldn't load when replayed. Audio vol was soft.
B003FL4O9E|4.0|Instant classic. Turns out the ooze was the secret all along. Also, super shredder is a force to be reckoned with.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You can raise dragons by feeding them.  You can do things a lot faster than many other games of this genre (you'll see what I mean when you get the game). Great game!
B009GX6SSK|5.0|This is mind candy. You get to see yummy actors-  and just forget for a minute whats really going on in the world. Good acting cannot be replaced by these horrible &#34;reality&#34; shows flooding the airways.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book.  One that keeps you wondering throughout.  I enjoyed every page and dreaded it coming to an end.  I highly recommend this book.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|It's very long and very hard to put down.<br /><br />Since I finished it, I've had a lot of trouble getting into any other book because it makes me realize that there aren't many books as good as Shantaram.
B004LROUNG|5.0|It is A great read....as usual Grisham has delivered a knock out punch with the Litigators.I thoroughly enjoyed the whole story
B003M70O5O|5.0|What an awesome season!  Katy(Gemma) story line was so well acted.  Opie's grief for Donna and Jax's decision to keep it quite and fallout that occurs from keeping that secret, was a nice character development.  Highlighting Chib's is what I like about the show;  we are continuously learning about each one in a wonderfully written show.  Bring on Season three.
1594204217|5.0|Like his other books, looks at food from whole new angle.  Really interesting read and I would recommend it to foodies
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I saw this version of P & P first so perhaps that it is why it is my favorite.  It fleshes out the book well but isn't as long as the later, most popular version.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Wonderful book. held my interest throughout the book. First book I have read in a long time, get it soon.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|People can hate as much as they want but if you are like me and were essentially ruined for life by the Disney fairy tale concept then you will like this movie. It is a fairy tale and in my opinion is a well done rendition!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Well written.....Baldacci keeps you on your toes from beginning to end with a very well constructed tale A really good book
B008RNYNDM|5.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen...no kidding.  However I have been wanting it for years and am so glad I found it on Amazon.  Let me say one more time THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE (but the soundtrack is pretty awesome).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks' books.  This was hard to put down after I started it.  The reading goes quickly and the story line doesn't disappoint.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|The Van Halen CD was everything I expected and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I play it in my car all the time!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this!  Since we have only one blue-ray with three TVs in the house, its nice to have a digital copy too.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I really loved this movie!! Not because the rioting or the acting blows anything else out of the water but because its just nice. It's a love story with cute kids and good Chemistry between the leads.and it's nicholasmsparks! So total chick flick but I love it!
B0078XGEK2|5.0|All I can say is this man is spot on with a lot of his statements in my mind that is anyway. I understand now why it is the road less traveled. Most people see me posts excerpts on my FB page and ask me what the heck I am reading. It can be life changing if you allow it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Shows the transformation of Castle from the beginning.  May have to get the whole season to see how it plays out. Wonderful show.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett again writes a gripping tale, the first in a trilogy, starting in the early 20th Century, focusing on the First World War (The Great War).  His particular talent is his development of characters, spanning continents and countries, down to the local communities and families in a Welsh coal mining town, aristocrats in England and Germany, and oppressed laborers and peasants in Russia, who ultimately form a grassroots movement to overthrow their tyranny of the Tsar to start the global movement of revolution and socialism. This first book ends with the end of WWI and the devastation of Germany, economically and morally, a condition which lends itself to a new movement, led by an unknown, Adolf Hitler, and the beginning of the worldwide Great Depression.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a wonderful, talented author. Khalid Hosseini expertly weaves the story, drawing you in without the reader even being aware of it. I simply could not put this book down, and now I'm so sad that it's finished.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Each episode title is a double entendre.<br /><br />It took 4 episodes before the actors began to live in their characters.  Laurence Fishburne is a bit of a blowfish until he finds his way into the inner Jack Crawford  Mads Mikkelsen's  immobile face is disconcerting which makes his dramatic break as a lightening fast killer machine exciting and surprising.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Even though I own a copy on DVD I had to buy the movie for my digital collection! It's soo wonderful to not have with me everywhere! Flawless cast, good writing and a great execution overall!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Reminds me of Mario Brothers--very fun and addictive!  EASY enough for a young child yet entertaining enough for an adult.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|My three children ages 13, 11 and 9 hounded me for this games because it looked so cool.  All three boys have kindle fire hd 7&#34;.  I hesitated to purchase the app due to its $6.99 price but the reviews were mostly good and the graphics did look great.  We had to clear some space on the kindle (this is mostly due to my kids having TONS of apps) and it downloaded fine.  However, the game hangs up on each of their kindles at the same point in the game (when they reach a city).  I don't know if this is a common problem with the game, but even after letting the kindle sit awhile, it is still hung up.  I have no choice but to turn the kindle off.  No matter how exciting the game, or how beautiful the graphics, it all means nothing if the game won't work.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|There are a few reasons to watch this film. Not among these is Tom Cruise's sneering portrayal of a cop with no discernible moral compass. Rosamund Pike's inspirational decolletage is on the list. Yes, I'm that shallow. I love the surprised look on her face throughout the movie  that says either &#34;OMG I'm in a movie with Tom Cruise&#34; or &#34;OMG I'm going to kill my agent&#34; or &#34;OMG has anybody seen Christopher McQuarrie on the set lately?&#34; The bar scene in which Tom is taller than nearly everybody else is amusing. Everybody knows Tom is short. Where did Christopher McQuarrie find all those short people, in Randy Newman's garage? Then there's Robert Duvall. I will pay to see 5 minutes of Robert Duvall any time, anywhere. It's kind of a cheat to put him in a movie just to sell a few tickets, but Jack Reacher needed the help.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is so much fun<br /> but it is hard an.d easy at the same<br />time  but you<br />should get this app
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Good movie, incredible of course but that's what sci-fi is all about.  Always good to see family values prevail. They need to find a different alien, that look is getting long in the tooth.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The most complex set of subplots yet. Just when you think you know what will happen, you get surprised. Only one more season.
B00821OX98|5.0|Action, adventure, thriller, drama movie that keeps you engaged at all time. Story is fairly good but they could have done it differently. Each episode has its own story to tell and they kind of follow main story which is fighting Aliens. Some of the characters need improvements and better acting. Overall 7.5 out of 10.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I'm a Dancing with the Stars fan. Need I say more. Julianne was good but I don't think a drama is her thing, at least not at this point in her career. She needs to stick with a more bubbly-fun role. But all in all it was a good performance.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love these games! Great strategy and problem solving. Kudos to the people that think these games up! Can hardly wait for more to come out
B000000XB9|5.0|I had this Album on Vinyl and 8 Track as a kid growing up and am thrilled to have it on CD. It bring back memories from another time. I LOVE IT
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Seen this many times and still like it although it makes me feel a bit old. Great soundtrack. Sometimes a little draggy but not for long.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I simply could not get the program to work for me and finally after several attempts I removed the program from my Kindle.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I actually buy old movies I like that are also in French and Spanish.  Find it's a great way to brush up and learn some new vocabulary.  If you're looking for High Definition, you'll be disappointed.  But look at the price for six movies.
B00BMQDM10|3.0|A light, frothy fun read for those times when you've had enough of intense psychological thrillers. Characters you want to throttle for their life choices, which shows how invested you actually become without realizing it.
B00124BNF4|4.0|There are so many great songs on this album. I bought the album for a few songs that I was familiar with, then I realized I knew so many more. Love it an highly recommend.
B00354YA2M|5.0|This is one of Bill Bryson's best. He alwasy educates - his books are well researched and informative, and although this one does not go into great depth, it is interesting in the small details he describes. It is his entertaining style that really does it though. I laughed out loud in the plane as I began it, and his description of a cricket match had me in hysterics.
B0086449YA|5.0|Love the album, sounds good, like a guy who is playing just because he likes to with no commercial needs pushing him into making just the same old pop music.
193700788X|1.0|Like many other fans, I fell deeply, madly in love with this series. It was fun, bawdy, adventurous, and full of twists. Much of my enjoyment came from seeing Sookie paired up with Eric through much of the series. He was funny, endearing, charismatic yet charmingly flawed. She was the same. I just didn't recognize either character in this book. Seeing her end up with the boring but dependable Sam was just painfully disappointing. It's like having a larger than life heroine like Scarlett O'Hara ride off into the sunset with the boring but dependable Mr Kennedy because he's a safer alternative to Rhett Butler. But hey, they'll always have their lumber business right? Similarly, we should all be pleased that Sookie is financially stable with her bar and annuity? *Sigh* This is a decision that a Mom would make for her child perhaps...but it's not the stuff of escapist romance. Consider me among the legions of deeply disappointed fans. Wish there could be a follow up book that explains away this one as a nightmare Sooke had...:(
B00007KWHG|5.0|Went to see The Jersey Boys Musical in Atlanta - the best music was recorded in the 50's  - two more
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|NICE BIG NUMBERS. FOR MY TABLET, CAN USE TO DO MY BILLS,ECT. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE NUMBERS ARE BIG AND BOLD.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|This movie would probably hold the attention more of a 20 to 30 something.  Harrison Ford did a good job in his role - the female lead was fair.  Pretty close to a lot of &#34;Yuppie&#34; types who are more identified by their occupation than by who they are.  I'm all for going all out and doing your job to the best of your ability, but when your job becomes your whole life - it's unhealthy.
B004GYY714|5.0|I am so happy with this app the sound is clear and to be able to hear the stations you enjoy at your fingertips is the best-selling app going.
B008PU8SR4|4.0|I enjoyed this novel because it is original, very creative as it is written from the point of view of a young boy with Asperger´s Syndrome. He has a very innocent, straightforward way of processing information, and I found it very entertaining and different.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Having read the novel, upon first viewing this film -- in the theater -- I was a bit worried that the quick edits (from story to story) was gonna make it tough to watch (and likely tough to understand if one hadn't read the novel).  But after seeing tha the filmmakers were doing quick cuts to introduce the six differnt, but inter-connected, stories, I relaxed wand went with it.<br /><br />Like the novel, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" the movie follows the path of six different narratives:<br />1) The 19th century island and sea-faring adventures of an American man, Adam Ewing, whose beliefs about slavery will be changed via his journey and an unlikely friendship<br />2) The early 20th Century (1930s) romantic story of Robert Frobisher a young, bisexual English composer in Belgium, apprenticing with an aging, past his prime musical icon. Via letters to his lover -- Rupert Sixsmith -- Frobisher recounts the creation of his one and only piece of music (\\"the Cloud Atlas Sextet\\") and of some sexual doings with his mentor's wife.<br />3) A mystery which takes place in 1970s california, involving magazine writer Luisa Rey and the aged Rupert Sixsmith -- not to mention, shady doings a nuclear power plant.<br />4) A present-day, London and England-based farce and \\"comedy of manners\\" involving sixty-something English vanity publisher Timothy Cavendish, a semi-reformed thug who wrote a memoir entitled KNUCKLE SANDWICH, and a very nasty nurse named Noakes (not to mention some very funny scenes involving a cat, a plunger and a van full of old folks).<br />5) A mid-21st Century SF-thriller, set in Neo-Seoul, Korea, centered around a fabricant -- a clone born into servitude -- named Somni-451, and her path to enlightenment and rebellion.<br />6) A far-future, post-apocalyptic, dystopian SF tale set in the Hawaiian islands, involving Zachary -- a man who is a sort of outcast of his tribe, because he let his brother and nephew die in an attack by cannibalistic rival tribesman, the Kona -- and a \\"prescient\\" (a far-future dweller who still has master over technology, and who is more intelligent than the average island dweller) named Meronym.  It seems that Meronym has come to Zachary's village in search of someone who can guide her to the top of a particular mountain on the islands. Zacharay -- who survived a Kona attack there -- is that man.<br /><br />  While all of these tales may seem too disparate -- and too far apart, time-wise -- to be related, as each story progresses the viewer learns that they are related, and that the fates of each person in the generation before affects those who come after (which is the underlying, and most important, theme of the film).<br /><br />For instance, Robert Frobisher is reading \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" while enduring the browbeating of his musical mentor, missing his male lover and half-heartedly fending off the attentions of this mentor's wife.<br /><br />And while leaving an interview gone-wrong, Luisa Rey finds herself stuck in an elevator with Rupert Sixsmith, who notices that she has a birthmark, on her shoulder, which is very similar to that of his long-dead lover, Robert Frobisher.<br />Because of this encounter, Sixsmith is moved to share information about illegal activity at the Nuclear power plant where he works, setting in motion a series of activities that will endanger the lives of Luisa Rey and several others.<br /><br />Timothy Canvendish, knight errant and independent publisher, while taking it on the lam (to escape some thuggish types who want money from him after their brother's book hits the bestseller lists), is, at one point, reading a book he will publish in the future, entitled HALF-LIVES: THE FIRST LUISA REY MYSTERY.<br /><br />Fabricant Somni-451, while first getting involved in activities forbidden to those created only to serve, sees part of a film entitled, \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" (a film that will inspire one of her coworkers to commit the first act of rebellionby a fabricant).  Later, through the help of a human, she is able to see the entire film.<br /><br />And Zachary and his tribal island dwellers all worship the \\"Goddess\\" Somni, repeating many of her words as spiritual and religious guides to living.<br /><br />  While the filmed version of CLOUD ATLAS differs from the book in some ways (there are a few more actions scenes, especially in the SF-oriented segments), those all help the narrative flow and make the editing (scenes of people looking for help, trapped under water, on the run, and in battle are edited in sucha a way that they happen back-to-back) even more artful.  The script (which is one of the few to do a great job of translating a novel into a film version), acting and cinematography of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" are all superb.<br /><br />This isn't a film for those who -- in the main -- like films such as \\"Sex in the City\\", \\"Dumb and dumber\\" or something like one-dimensional Vin Diesel \\"car flicks\\".  This is a film for those who enjoy movies like \\"Atonement\\", \\"A Very Long Engagement\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", Minority Report\\", and so on.  In other words, a movie for thinking people -- definitely not a no-brainer (although no-brainers -- like \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" -- certainly have their place).<br /><br />And anyone confused as to the theme -- that all of our lives here on earth are interconnected, as are our fates -- should blame themselves, since the director/writers beat that particular drum louder than the novel did (a birthmark that shows up on at least one character in each different story -- in the novel, only two or three had it) and the refrain of Somni's words (\\"our lives are not our own\\") to underscore the theme.<br /><br />The film isn't without it's flaws, but they are minor.

B001EA4M7M|3.0|I love the story, have read it several times, and seen several different versions.  This one is pretty good, but again, my favorite is still the A & E series from the '90's.  Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy cannot be bested.  He was perfect for the roll, as was Elizabeth.
8866137634|5.0|I love this notebook. The quality of the materials used when making it are top notch. I know this notebook will last for years and still look great. Even better is that is ties in perfectly with Evernote, my second brain.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me guessing till the end which kept happening over and over and over. Looking forward to the movie soon
B008I43DYU|5.0|I use it at work I use the calculator were. When I have a brain free I break out the numbers.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|I was really anticipating this movie. But when I saw it, I observed the following: it very definitely looked like the quality you see in \\"made for TV\\" movies. (Which figures since it is an MTV production). I could not stop thinking Hansel was being played by actor Rob Schneider. They could be brothers. The movie seems to be an accurately rendered amalgam of other movies: A lot of Van Helsing, Princess Bride, Hulk, Beauty and the Beast, Sleepy Hollow, The Matrix, a huge amount of Twilight, and the Labyrinth, to name a few....Hansel seriously cannot hold onto his gun. He drops his firearm at LEAST twenty times. I am not kidding. Gretel can take a punch, agreed, up to a point at which time she crumples, which seems like her role in the majority of the film.<br />With all she has to pull together in her busy schedule, the bad guy spends the whole movie walking SO slowly, showing nothing but dry amusement as she beats on the protagonists, if she would only run, she would be more successful, quicker, however, the overconfident \\"walking bad guy\\" is a common cinematic. It's considerably overdone in this picture.<br />I think the best example of what I am referring to when I mention a made for TV feeling, is a dungeon scene with reasonably dungeon like effects including stone walls and such, however there is not a speck of dust, nor cobweb, nor really anything macabre in the dungeon. It's a dustless, clean dungeon in a shambles. Most \\"scenes\\" are obviously \\"sets\\" with the most conspicuous aspects being a painfully flat and level floor and a lack of actual detail at the periphery of several sets. Budget? You might also notice a fairly evident amount of green screen work, which is in all films these days but not quite as obviously.<br />Too many inconsistencies to describe, a single example is a witch who can literally punch chunks out of trees but doesn't take off the protagonists' heads with a pretty decent direct hit. The troll is a 'made for TV' costume and special effect in the extreme. An enormous rubber head with two enormous rubber paws and two huge burlap bags for feet on nothing more than a normal human frame. Disappointing.<br />Let's not ruin the film for the 10-17 year old crowd. In general, if there are witches being killed by cocky-and-often-effective protagonists in black trench coats, things like a cohesisve plot are secondary concerns. At other times and for an older crowd, you look at your watch waiting for the plot to come back together. The language is nothing new, but too many F bombs for some younger kids. All in all an enjoyable picture, but I would recommend waiting til it's down in price on DVD or rentable for just a few bucks.in the extreme.

B001TAJGO6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. If anyone is debating on if they should watch it, you should just watch. I loved it.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|The entire theme and the scenes were magnificent. The scenario was like a beautiful dream.<br />acrobatics were superb and very well executed. The entire cinema was very captivating...Loved It!
6302182557|4.0|Works good<br />Good Condition<br />Took a little longer than I thought it would to ship.<br /> But overall its a classic and worth waiting for
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Very awkward when using cover AND AC power.  Requires removing cover and/or having plug at bottom and sitting on it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great action. Great car chase. Duvall was an excellent choice of character. I highly recommend this movie. Ending shows promise of a sequel.
B000HL09MG|1.0|This has to be the worst movie either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman had ever participated. Not only because of the sexual nature, but, because of the poor story line.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It is a kind of &#34;keeps you interested&#34; kind of a game.Its fun.Only draw back is having to pay for the full version
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game. very addictive and fun. once you build up your car you can really have fun! need I say more?
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Story is very simple, and short. It is a high quality shooting game but once the story is over theres nothing to do. And the multiplayer gets boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting and I really love it and I am getting forward to the new updates
B005KPDAN4|5.0|I have now seen them all, sorry to have it end.  Will likely go back and watch all the seasons again, I like it that much!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I saw this on HBO and fell in love with the movie. After Twilight I was hesitant to order anything with Kristen Stewart, but she did an amazing job here.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I enjoyed the second half of the film more than the first, but over all it was a quite enjoyable movie.  Bradley Cooper's character was very authentic and I enjoyed his portrayal of mental illness.  The rest of the cast did well, but seeing Cooper out of his &#34;Hangover&#34; character was refreshing.I won't buy it, but I might rent it again some day.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|My son is 4 and he loved the movie.  I'm over 30 and I liked it too!  I would recommend it for a good family movie.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I might relearn some of my music.  Try it,  Chopsticks sounds good.  The keys are kinda small for heck, the program is free so I can't complain.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Very fun to watch with family.  Great memorie, great acting.  I recommend this movie to Trekkies around the galactic universe...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The concept of the movie didnt attract me.  everthing I thought I a movie to rent or go the theater, Ive always overlooked this one.  BIG MISTAKE.  I love this movie
B005KLN056|5.0|I was hesitant to order this, but the quality of both the picture and sound is first rate. I am impressed.
B00BI745AA|3.0|The film was well done, remaining true to the source material, however I am just not a fan of this musical. My wife loved it, and also loves the musical so I do not think my review is a commentary on the film itself, but rather my tastes.  I enjoy musicals, but this was not for me.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Great plot and execution.  My son and I really liked this movie.  I would recommend it.<br /><br />Another couple words needed.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think this was the best of the series. There was a lot of fighting, but I loved it. I see how many people give it a bad review, saying \\"Oh, Percy should have picked Rachel\\", \\"The prophecy said *the* hero, not a hero!\\", etc. I thought it was the best book ever. Besides, a prophecy can refer to more than one hero, right? I love this book, it's probably of of the best I've ever read.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was not quite what I was expecting from the trailers we saw. I enjoyed it as I got deeper into it and it opens up a spiritual<br />meaning I wasn't expecting.
B008KW43TE|4.0|I am pretty critical of music now a days and I must say this is REALLY music.  Simple melodic and great singing
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I ordered this and can't watch it enough. It was used but in perfect condition. I highly recommend it, if for nothing else but to see Tom Cruise sing Bon Jovi.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Found some surprising things out about Shirley mcclaine.  However, I kept in mind that this was after all the daughters point of view.  She was inconsistent in her comments about her mother...sometimes praising her but more often, denigrating her.  Another mommy dearest?<br /><br />Caroline Leto<br />Hollywood, fl.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|A great and interesting story with a hero that you admire. Fascinating until the end and sadly saying goodbye to the story's characters.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I very much enjoyed this novel.  It has two levels, the lighter, contemporary story, and the darker, historic experience of the misremembered man.  In many ways, it is a lot like modern Ireland - bright, worldly, open at the surface, but still facing dark experiences of the past and trying to figure out how they shape the present.<br /><br />The story is well-paced, presents a variety of types of characters, and reads with a very distinct voice.  The plot proves to have a wonderful turn, and the author manages to not depend on that twist to be the sole source of the reader's satisfaction with the experience.<br /><br />Anymore, most popular Irish fiction gets compared to Maeve Binchy.  If that is your standard for &#34;an Irish novel,&#34; this book will most likely satisfy.  It will also take a more direct look at human reprecussion of some of the evils formerly accepted under the guise of religious service.  That it still manages to me such a pleasure read is a compliment to the author.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Well written, good story line. Its one of those books you start and finish over a period of two days, when you can read a full novel over a period of two days the author has a winner, Safe Haven is a winner.  Mike Young
B00BI73CVI|5.0|this is the best les miserables version to come out yet.  I am having withdrawals I think I just need to buy the movie
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this story was a logical next step and a good follow up to the last book. It was interesting and now I want to read the final book.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great script, great performances, an unexpected look at a familiar topic.  Should at least have been nominated for an academy.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great story! Lots of fun to read, the 5 book bundle is a little confusing in the chapter menu thing but very economical
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I started reading this book because of the previews for the movie. I didn't understand it and found it to be extremely confusing. I finished it, but I do not recommend it.
B009R659L8|2.0|First let me state I'm a Mary Higgins Clark fan, but this novel fell well short of the authors previous submissions, I felt the story itself dragged and was hard to stay with. Sorry Mary.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love David Baldacci's books. and this one is no exception.  It grabs your attention and keeps it for the entire story
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a strong woman with an amazing story!!!  I couldn't put this book down!  This is a chilling story of survival and strength!  Amazing!
B00271B752|3.0|In my opinion, the HD quality was not that good. The film was quite grainy. I had seen the movie many years ago and liked the movie but felt the HD quality was not that good.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I love this album with all my heart. It showcases her bocals as well as her ability to write amazing lyrics
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I have several of their CD's and enjoy all of them.  Their voices blend together smoothly, and they cover a wide variety of of subjects and singing styles in their songs.  One of my favorite groups.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|It is a great product for scrapbookers and a good value for money to buy or have one. Should the price been more cheaper, I would love to buy it more.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie.  I couldn't see it at the theatre, but have very much enjoyed it on the TV.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is my first gaming level mouse and I've to say that this mouse hasn't let me down. Right away I noticed what other purchasers were talking about with the weighting system being a frustration, thankfully it's a one time thing and after taking down that chore this mouse has left me nothing but pleased.  Once you get used to the grip which the thumb buttons force you into the mouse feels really natural and it's amazing to have a little stress taken off of my left hand while i'm gaming but shifting a little focus to the right. Honestly this being my first higher quality mouse i've nothing to compare it to but it's exactly what I was hoping to find in them. Smooth and quick movement, responsive with several buttons well within reach and a solid program to back it all up.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|For me to dark and chaotic , I did not scared once , waste of my time and money , I should watch something different , very confusing without the beginning or end  , just one of the chapter between  the dark times . You will find out yourself if you like it or not, I did NOT
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is really funny - was laughing through out the book.<br />People were giving me funny looks when I was reading it.<br /><br />Highly recommended! A must read!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Absolutely the best movie and soundtrack I've ever bought !! If you have not seen it or want to have it forever, buy now ...
B009NYU1CQ|4.0|I thought the chemistry between Affleck and Bullock was good, the story was entertaining and kept me intrigued, and the ending was satisfying.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I discovered David Baldacci's writing by accident with an audio book.  I haven't stopped reading his books since.  This book is as good as all the rest.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I love this series! I am listening to the audio books, and started watching the series with my husband. The characters are rich and realistic. The heroes are flawed, and many of the \\"evil\\" characters are conflicted. There is treachery, plot twists, no character is safe.  There is action a plenty, at times, very brutal. Life is very hard. Absolutely viewing for mature adults only.  Can't wait for season 3! (I know it's running now on premium tV) This is a series that my husband and I both enjoy equally, and it's great when we find a series we love to watch together!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved the season, although we have never received the disc we purchased. we ended up watching it at a friend's house, then had to purchase direct  viewing ti finish it.  I'm a little disappointed that the disc still has not arrived.. We did like the show though.  Maybe a little more timely follow through with purchases would help next time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and I finished the first level In less than 3 seconds. Addictive is all I have to say.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|They dont make movies like this anymore. It was filled with action and a lot of fun. I would recommend this movie ti friends.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|I had never seen this movie because I did not like the television version, but I watched it as a class requirement and so glad I did. I have to remind myself that Harrison Ford is good in anything he does, and Tommy Lee Jones could read out of a phone book and I'd be mesmerized. Love the movie!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Disney movies are always good, but this one was exceptional.  The disc arrived in great shape, and I've gotten much enjoyment from watching it
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|play it. you will love. the best game I have played in a long time. you will play for hours.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|JD Lenzen knocks it out of the park with this book!.I have it on my Kindle and in paperback.He also has instructional videos for every Tie in this book. This book has led me to making all sorts of things I can do as a stress relieving hobby and as a money maker and all in my spare time.I wish stormdrane or some of the other knot tying masters would do things like this too.there is a lot of talent in the knot tying community.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is the best i used to play this game on my dads smart phone but when i looked at the top free games i came across HILL CLIMB RACING!!! this is a very fun game i deffinetly recommend this game THANK YOU CREATORS FOR FINALLY LETTING KINDLE FIRE OWNERS BE ABLE TO GET THIS GAME and remember everything is more better with grammar!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have played both games virtual city and virtual city playground and both game give you great graphics. Plus they give you awesome play and they let you play and all day long and you don't have to buy credits if you don't want to that's what seperates these games frame the rest.
B002QYSZBO|1.0|I did not finish. It started out super, fast action, great premise and then it just faded into a boring movie. When my mind started wandering to household chores, I knew it was time to turn it off.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|I love the super hero movies that have been on this last year.  And really enjoy Iron Man.  This disc was received in great shape, and very enjoyable
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is not only an adventure story, but also a reflection and commentary on life and spirituality.  It is humorous, poignant, and insightful.
0783219695|5.0|First, it came in excellent packaging. I thank the Seller. It came in time and in beautiful condition. The highs and lows of the flight engineers as one was replaced for a false described illness. The others were scared, but hopeful that they would, too, walk on the moon. But too many accidents by human error cripple the ship and as Gene Krantz said, &#34;Work the problem people&#34;, and &#34;We know what's broken, now find out how we can fix it&#34;.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very handy app.  It gives me so much info on my Kindle HD battery.  It has a nice graph that tells how much battery is being used over time and how much longer the battery will last for different activities such as reading, surfing the net, and watching movies.  I highly recommend this app.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Shows what real talent can do without computers and fake music and no autotune. I enjoyed a brief trip back to my youth and GRAND FUNK RAILROAD&#62;
0810988232|5.0|This is a beautiful oracle.  Yes!  It also gives some interesting insights.<br />I am a dedicated user of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot Deck but sometimes one needs to lighten up a bit.  While it did at first seem to be tarot lite I have been amazed at the insightful readings that I have received from this deck and book.  I keep one in the states and one at my home in South America so it is always handy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|There were some good twists and turns along the way, but I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and anticlimactic.  The changes in writing style between the characters was impressive.

B00CC3KBAW|5.0|If you are fond of the likes of Symphony X, Hammerfall, and Nightwish, this album will fit right in your collection. Melodic Metal at its best.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|a music site for your purchased  music and unsigned artists to showcase their music... all you get is all other artists trying to do same thing. You wind up with a playlist of music from everyone else and no way to really showcase your music except to add it to site and hope someone listens. A big waste of time. Allot more sites for the independent musician.
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed the story a lot, but the narration is lacking. I felt this story could have used a third person narration & have been better off. Also, the fragments are a little overdone and takes away the impact they should be making. I'd recommend it to anyone not picky about structure.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Everything I love about the 60's, cool clothes,  hot cars,  bad ass leading man and oh yeah a solid plot.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Recently disappointed by Mohsin Hamid's latest work, I expected more of the same with Hosseini. His most famous work is well known in most countries and somehow I expected him to get lazy. I am pleased to report that in my opinion, this book is better than the Kite Runner.<br /><br />First, this book does not have the unrealistic, convenient plot that the Kite Runner had. Things in this book happen as they would in life: randomly, slowly and not in service to some overarching plot. From the first chapter, where a man is animatedly telling his children a story that foreshadows the events of the rest of the book, to the end where we close on the same pair of siblings many decades later, no longer the naive young children but tired adults, worn out by their lives.<br /><br />Second, the characters are more than just an archetype with one major flaw to make them memorable, or one incident that haunts them for the rest of their lives. The characters in the Kite Runner were mostly one toned, with a single flaw or regret that they spend all their lives trying to remedy, sometimes in a very unrealistic fashion. The characters in And the Mountains Echoed are like real people: they have deep running issues with their parents, they are uncomfortable with their place in society, pettily jealous of others, make bad decisions and generally have a rough time of it. They are also their own worst critics and secretly know their own failing and weaknesses and often find themselves unequal to just magically resolving their issues. I enjoy a writer who does not feel the need to treat his characters with too much care. By the end of each character's narrative, you will admire each character because they are all too human, and familiarly so.<br /><br />Third, the book employs a very useful narrative where we experience things from the point of view of one character and then switch to another character who eventually shows us another side to one or more of the same events. This creates avery layered view of the world (and of shared events) and sometimes the author waits for ages to revisit a seemingly inconsequential event (from one character's POV) from another character's POV and adds a layer of detail and relevancy to these events.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Everyone knows what Facebook is and what it's all about.  My only real issue is that on occasion I will get e-mails - not Facebooks messages, but e-mails in my outlook - from companies saying they know me, that I have never dealt with before.  Facebook will not even respond to my questions regarding these e-mails.  Other than that, it is what it is.
B008CLI3TE|2.0|It takes WAY to long to load  . I believe it's because it has to many languages?Are there scenes left out that were on tv?
B009K86D86|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone I know what a eye opener shame on our Government for letting this take place I will NO longer buy meat that is not free range...........
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is so great. I love it. Definitely a great read. I would recommend this book for young adults looking for a quick and fun read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is a great read. It is all from the main caracters point of view. How he sees people. The discription of the dance was breath taking. If only they included that in the movie. The book is sooo much better than the movie. If you think the movie was good, READ THE BOOK, you will not be disapointed.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Recommended for Everyone that like cod. Awesome Gameplay. Combat and Multiplayer is Amazing and its only .99 cents. Can't wait for 4.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is awesomely awesome and you should buy it, but they should lower the price a little maybe  $5 .99
B008K8VDPU|2.0|Always, with this type of app, and I've tried most of them, it is the delay between &#34;hitting&#34; the key and hearing the note. I did like the sounds included, but other than a fun toy for a minutes distraction, I wouldn't bother with it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|It's Dexter!  I've been hooked since the first season and never once been disappointed.  The writing is as good as it was in the very beginning.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started out watching the series on HBO and thought I'd try the books. The show very closely followed this book, but of course you get more character development in the book. Can't wait to start the next one!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Not horrible, but not stellar. My husband liked it more than me. I wouldn't watch it a second time or any sequels that come out.  For all the hype, it was underwhelming.
B005544TRQ|3.0|This show is okay, but I don't see it as exceptional in any way. Maybe I just haven't bought into the characters yet, but nothing about the series seems special. It's just plain vanilla TV.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Sloan manages to blend old and new world in this engaging story of mystery and magic and believe-it-or-not--google!<br />If you're looking for a break from zombies, predictable romance or preachy self-help, this is the respite you're seeking.
B00846WWVM|2.0|No really, it's me, I think the game is pretty cool, absorbing (get it?) and amusing, it's just not my thing as it requires dexterity and patience, of which I'm devoid. Great graphics and the soundtrack as well as effects are neat.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is a cute game if I could only get control of the joy stick so to speak, if I could master that I am sure it would get a 5 star rating, but bear in mind I will keep on trying.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An unexpected love story that touches the reader on so many levels.It brilliantly deals with the complexity of young relationships both with parents and peers in the face of adversity. The characters are sophisticated in their thoughts, dialogue and actions. The teenagers are often more perceptive than the adults (which if why so many of them love this book), for they are not as much jaded as they are realistic. A joy to read!
B00CFOXBX2|1.0|Save your money and rent an old Hitchcock classic... Hitchcock was a supreme artist when it came to psychological thrillers... this movie is a huge waste of my time and actors' talent!
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|This movie was hyped and I think my expectations for it were a bit high. It's an okay story, and it's well enough acted, but I found it painful to watch because some of the characters were too stereotypical.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This movie was downright awful.  Hard to understand and borrrring!!  No action except for the first two minutes of the movie.  Do not waste your time and/or money on this film.  Two and a half hours of my life I can't get back.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|if you want to have have a game that will suck hours out of your day this is it im only 40 hours in and have a quite a while to go to finish.its kind of like Pokemon but different i usually dont like turn based rpg because of the constant level grinding. in this game though its different since you spend half your time in the real world then some days you go to the tv world where all the fights take place. so its really balanced in that respect and its all up too you how you want to go about it. honestly this is the best vita game perfect companion to you when your out and about or about to go to sleep.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|If you like Anthony Hopkins you will really enjoy this movie.  He brings so much to anything that he does.  Enoy its Great
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is soooo awesome and cool...if you are looking for a risk type of game or just something to get addicted to, this is your game!!!!Its better than risk and easy to understand. I love this GAME
B003FSUS4M|4.0|Well written but I think I was looking for a different ending.  Would definitely read other novels by this author TOIBIN.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This is such a knock out wonderful CD. For all those Boz Scaggs fans who love his unique voice, you won't be disappointed. He does some covers and then there are some bluesy new songs which grabbed me right away. I am going to see him in concert this year....mainly because I enjoyed this album so much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is superb and the story line is compelling.  My wife and I really enjoy watching the show and see how the characters lives are impacted by their daily interaction with each other and the changing world.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Helps to get the camera immediately. Thanks for the software and its a very good application for everyone who has a kindle.
B003L77GG0|4.0|Great series, and was delivered in a timely manner with no damages.  I don't know what to do now that I've watched the entire series...
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I needed a case that would allow both horizontol and vertical positions, but not too bulky. This works very well, while protecting my Kindle.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|A classic movie that helped spawn the chase scene and crime genre as a whole.  McQueen is an absolute legend.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|Interesting concept. A little disjointed at first but it all came together as it progressed. I would watch it again.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|A funny story to read out loud. My 5 year old loved it and we plan to read more Roald Dahl
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The Selection series books are awesome! The Elite has a two love trianges and some drama and action. Definately worth my time!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|So the Kindle HD Fire is awesome, but Amazon really tries to restrict your access to Google native market.  Rather then find sites with potential malware on these modified .apk files to install.  So I rooted my Kindle HD Fire, in which I was installing the latest Google Play Market onto my Kindle.<br /><br />This lovely application helped remove the Read Only permission on the System App folder required to install the market services; this application is worth the $3.99.  Just for the ability to truly alter your file system.
B009UWYFFK|4.0|Watched it the other day and it was quite entertaining. When you turn it off, you think &#34;hey, that was nice.&#34; - and you will want to watch it again. I think it will become a great Halloween tradition.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved it!  Could not put the book down and loved watching Lou change and develop over the course of the book.  Highly recommend this.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I never heard of Daft Punk much, as I'm not too big into electronic music. But this track REALLY blew me away. The funky beat & Pharrell Williams smooth lyrics make this song in the top 5 tracks of this year for sure!<br /><br />Give this song a try, & come back to purchase this gem
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|This is such a great movie, I love having it on my kindle because I can watch it anywhere. One of the best movies I've ever seen.
B00003TL18|5.0|This is one of my very favorite pieces of music and I will play it till it won't play and then I will buy another one and play it till it falls apart. I loved Roy and when he died I was as sad as if one of my dear friends had died
B001684L0A|5.0|I will be honest I haven't read the biography that this is based on.  This is my perception of just the movie.<br /><br />The actors are wonderful throughout the series.  They bring life to our founding fathers and really depict the struggle of the time in a very believable fashion.  Though you encounter several people any educated American should know, it focuses on John Adams.  A very under rated President, but a remarkable person.<br /><br />Obviously there are only memoirs to gauge their personalities, in this story the went with a more dramatic approach.  This approach really emphasized and outlined the struggle of the time.  It also highlighted a lot of the great feats that John Adams accomplished throughout his life.<br /><br />A work worth watching for strong educational and interesting points.  If your looking for an escape from the more fictitious movies that surround our culture.  This brings history alive in a very wonderful manner.  I'd strongly recommend renting or buying it.  Keep in mind that it is quite dramatic- but the witty dialogue makes the series wonderful to watch.
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|During the opening credits there are flashbacks to previous films to jog your memory. These are not intended to bring anyone up to speed. There is some minor character build up in spite of the fact we already know who they are.<br /><br />In this film Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) becomes involved with a group of bad guys lead by Shaw (Luke Evans). They are described as the best in &#34;vehicular warfare&#34; something that appears to be almost unique to this film series. In order to catch them, our &#34;swagger-less&#34; cop Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) must employ the use of wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team in order to save Europe or something else immaterial. They are up against a group of criminal described as their &#34;evil twins&#34; because apparently we couldn't figure that out for ourselves.<br /><br />The film uses all the fun things we have grown use to in the series: impossible car chases/races, fist fighting, eye candy, tough guy talk, and of course the humorous banter and a disdain for physics in a fantastic climax scene.<br /><br />In addition to all the features that appeal to muscle heads, the film also works upon the theme of the modern extended family. Because of societies' mobility and separation, many people have incorporated friends as part of their &#34;family.&#34; This film stretches the honor among thieves into the brotherhood of man, but doesn't make it too sappy. A great addition to the series, one that opens up to sequel possibilities. If you own 5 of them. Make it a 6 pack.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a script with a larger role for Jordana Brewster.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1-2 f-bombs. Implied sex. No nudity (side breast, skimpy bikinis)
B000FC2ROU|5.0|I am amazing by Haruki Murakami.  What a gift to be able to write like that and tell such an interesting and page turning story.  Highly recommend it!
B002ZG994U|5.0|what a wonderfjl remake of a tv show. it was great. gthe dvd was in good shape. but this dvd
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I CANNOT TELL YOU TO MUCH ABOUT THIS GAME .WE CANCELED FROM OUR KINDLE . ALL I CAN  STAY IS I DO NOT LIKE IT LIKE IT DIFFERENT STROKES FOR
B004ELSDZK|1.0|The reviews were so good that I had to try this game but after about 5 levels I was tired of listening to the mumbling Totem freak and also still had no idea what the strategy is to win each level. I can't even get where the description of awesome graphics would come from because I only saw a few objects pictured - an owl -like post, a floating totem guy and some bubbles with eyes that you're supposed to somehow &quot;match &quot;.  I uninstalled.
