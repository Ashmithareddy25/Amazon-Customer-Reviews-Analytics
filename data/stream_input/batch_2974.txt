B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I have 4 12volt outlets in my minivan and this adaptor fits in only 2 of them. The other 2 are too small for the adaptor. It needs to be a tight fit, so it wound fall out on a bumpy road, but apparently all 12 volt outlets aren't built the same, so making it a tight for most outlets means no fit for others. Other than that, it works fine for my family's iPhones.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a brain exercising game at its finest. I am having a great  time figuring out each picture's additional items!
B00F88H5K2|4.0|It is a well-acted movie, and a very interesting story. Anyone who is in the least bit homophobic should stay away.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|More heterosexual than i thought it would be. Only saw it because it was required for a class, but it was ok.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Takes a while to open pics.  Can be played as a totally free game, but a lot more challenging that way.  If you are willing to pay though, it would go more quickly, and you could play for longer periods of time each go.  I like the feature that your energy recharges while you are not playing.  You would be surprised at how hard it is to find the same items in pics you've examined so many times.  You also getlittle rewards daily, just for playing.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Just read this for Book Club in under three days and have no clue what I just read. This book was very weird and I did not enjoy it at all.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Although I'm 50 years old - - I love this CD! Every song is as good as the last/next! Have is playing in my car for about 3 weeks now (since I received it).
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Liked Jack as usual. What a story!  It kept me up at night as usual. Will read as many Reacher novels as Mr. Child cares to write.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app does exactly as it says-I like the idea that you can combine different sounds and a nice combination of sound's
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really good game!! Helps to pass the time and makes you think. Not for young children tho. Really enjoy playing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Error messages on the configuration were a little lacking. A code and short message & googling it didn't help.<br /><br />Look for more services being hookup'd.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|...but not sure what it all added up to.  A few too many unresolved story-lines, but a joy to spend time with his writing, imagination and soulfulness.
B000062X90|4.0|Wishbone Ash may fly under a lot of people's radar and that's too bad for them. This album is very good 70's guitar driven rock. It's not hard rock. It's just good rock. Very good songs and some added live versions as a bonus. Get it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I enjoyed watching it once again and the added option to watch with the pop ups informing locations and uncommon works and meanings made it that more interesting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It keeps me occupied while sitting around waiting.  I would recommend it for any one who is easily bored with inactivity.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Movies these days don't have an original plot but this one does for sure! Wonderful movie - funny and interesting.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I'll leave the movie reviews to the other 'experts' here...(laughs!). I purchased the Blue-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack product. While Amazon's page makes this look like it contains the extended collectors edition version, it does not. I should have researched this more. It contains the original movie only, in 3D (Blu-ray) and 2D (both Blu-ray and DVD). The 3D is great, but this movie is NOT the Special-Edition Re-Release nor is it the Collectors Extended Cut. It is the original 162-minute film as released in the theaters. If you were expecting more, you'll be disappointed. As of this date, the extended cut is unfortunately not available in 3D. Otherwise, we love the movie, and the 3D really adds to the experience of watching Avatar!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Good rendition of the book in a large film production. Great visuals but more futuristic at times than the era. Performances by great actors live up to expectations. Simpy put a very good movie.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Buddy Guy at his best, definitely worth listening to over and over again. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Love the series.  They make a great team with surprises around every corner.  Great marathon for a rainy fall/winter weekend!  All you need to add is take out!
B00000FC5H|5.0|This entire album is catchy!When I am feeling good -or want to feel good I play this!So much fun to sing and dance to!
B000093FLA|3.0|Didn't like this film too much. It just had too many plots, twists and turns that didn't seem to come together very well. Pitt and Statham are worth seeing as always it overall it bombed.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Great fun to be had by all..good graphics many levels challenging price is great totally fun go get it today
B00FCIROYK|5.0|A wonderful, appropriate soundtrack. I enjoyed the ambience as much as the songs in the diverse radio stations in game.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I was very happy with movie there were small things that I didn't like with it because I loved the original.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game for puzzle solvers - challenging but not too tough. Highly recommend - you won't be sorry.  Very addicting and fun.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like facebook and how everybody try to use it to advertise.  To much information is shown for the world to see.
0792840461|5.0|Vary fine movie with character development. McQueen is vary classy and Fay Dunaway is Beautiful. He is a master criminal and she is an investigator trying to nab him by any means nesasary.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Received & enjoyed, just as I did with the first season...wonderful to go back & re-view in my own time.....completely enthralled by the storylines
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was a great movie with a ending that will surely catch you off guard! I would highly recommend to anyone.
1781162646|5.0|Admittedly, I'm not a die-hard King fan or self-proclaimed King expert like many on this board are; therefore, my 5-star may seem to be overly generous.<br /><br />But I truly enjoyed this book. King shows some outstanding good writing in this book, following many of his own good advices, such as always resorting to sensory feel, artfully crafted dialog and tightly woven interpersonal logic of emotion.<br /><br />And King exposes his sensitive side in this tale, starting from the narrative of a young lad heartbroken from his first love, to how a kite flying in the sky brings joy and wonder to the hearts of a young boy living on borrowed time, and his loving mother who's always had trouble conforming to the social norms, and that of the lad himself who's fate keeps depositing him into some extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />King had me early at \\"my shadow walked with me on the sand\\" when the lad walked to work in the morning and \\"my shadow walked with me on the water\\" when the lad came back from work at dusk. What a vivid picture. What a brilliant, yet understated observation. An author almost has to have done that commute on foot across that beach, in order to be able to describe it with such ease and grace.<br /><br />Well done Mr. King.<br /><br />M.

1781162646|4.0|Fun and exciting . A carnival of emotion and suspense with a satisfying ending. Good read teens thru adults !
B003XT603Q|5.0|Murakami has skillfully created a quiet and gentle world in Norwegian Wood. So quiet that you do not hear the campus slogans of the revolutionaries of the late 60's. You only hear the deepest inner voices of lovers separated by sickness and death. So gentle that Watanabe volunteers to watch a dying man on his hospital bed, changing his bedpans and feeding him a cucumber. And there is so much details: when it rains you can tell that Murakami wants you to feel the drops on your skin. And the constant longings and denials...<br /><br />And there is a rather charming fascination with death -- self-inflicted death -- in this book, probably the only thing truly Japanese. Death somehow becomes beautiful; it becomes a continuation of life. And when one reflects on life, as the main character Watanabe does to begin the book, tender memories seems to outweigh the heavy-liftings one had to do in life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone over 35. There is a lot of walking on the part of the main character in this book. And it feels like a long restful walk to read through this book. It lets us behold the wonder of life at every turn, and the pain we have to endure in order to embrace that wonder.<br /><br />And I'm sure that's why I could read every word of those long letters from Naoko and not be bored. Because I too had yearnings when I was at that age. Because I was also once very fragile, just as breakable as Naoko.<br /><br />M.

B009O07NMA|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can play all the way through and love every song! It's currently my favorite CD.<br />My favorite tracks are:<br />-Get your shine on<br />-Stay<br />-Dayum, Baby<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this album.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|When I got the film it was kind of screwed up, my pictures took overnight to develop. and the pictures then had an antique kind of vibe to it, which was cool but wasn't what i asked for.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Blue Ray, Movie both five stars, I would give it more stars if allowed.  This was a wonderful movie with fantastic new actors with this type of movie and acting, Paramont should be looking into a long term series again.
0515141429|3.0|Everybody I know loves this series, but after a few entertaining chapters, I found the writing and the plot became old.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Although very real, almost too real and looses some to fhe original comic book situations for bat man, atleast the origninal comics.  My rating is for the blue ray version so I am mostly looking at the high definition quality not the movie itself.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Completely enthralling! Raw, honest, and totally hardcore. It took a strong human to allow themselves to be so vulnerable, especially one who is a self proclaimed egomaniac!  Even in the midst of addiction and blatant self abuse, the honesty of his internal war is so engaging.  The writing is descriptive and revealing. I love that Nikki gave a voice to those he negated within his diary confessions, allowing them to tell their side of the story.  This is one of the best rock star memoirs I've read so far, I wish it hadn't ended.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I have this in tape form, dvd and now blue ray.  Blue ray is best of the forms I have.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great read- interesting to the end! I'm 23 and really enjoyed it even when I was frustrated. Ender goes through so much so at times it's hard to keep reading because you don't know if things will get better or worse for him. In that same vein you keep reading because you want to know if it will get better or worse.
0345548981|4.0|enjoyed the Djocovic back ground story, enjoyed the diet information, learned some new aspects of gluten free eating, well worth the time and money
B00CATONCA|2.0|It looks cool, however, the lights do not work.... Not sure how to fix.... Tried new batteries but no luck...
B008ALA6DW|5.0|As advertised and on sale!
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|The plots are getting better than ever and the characters are getting more finely drawn.  Montalbano is the ideal head of the police group, well liked and respected by those who work for him.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|best zombie movie I ever saw. very original and good quality.Excellent acting and it really had good suspense thought the whole movie.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|this season is as intriguing as the first.  I love that it is unpredictable, complicated and leaves questions in my mind,
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I'd recommend it to any friend.  Give it a try if youre into good old fashioned &#34;boy adventures&#34; from the past.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This show makes me think I am listening to the news but with incite as to what actually is happening.  It is not what it seems.  I am captivated by the story.
B000OLRM2O|5.0|Great film<br />Showing the human side of a champion Ali showed many sides if his personality some good some bad.<br />Fame can be uplifting or destructive
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book exposed me to different sides of situations that I was previously misunderstanding. You quickly forget that an author wrote this, and listen to the narratives while reflecting on your own life.
B004N62KTG|5.0|This is my favorite GAGA song.  I love the beat.  Her best song yet.  Love it loud and great to drive by.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not his best book, but the story was entertaining enough. The ending (especially the last sentence of the book) was disappoinnting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Definitely like my old soapbox watching days, love this series!  It just gets better with every season.  I plan on watching all of them!
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I suppose I would have rated this a 3, but I am sucker for syfi movies.<br /><br />So I just sat back and enjoyed, but the Zombie component was a bit far fetch.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|One of my favorite CDs. Waiting patiently for vol 2.10 more words are required. now only six. I am almost done. done!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book. I look forward to more books by Anthony Ryan. I liked how he kept going to the past then the present.
B005544TRQ|5.0|funny, smart and not too repetitive.<br />we enjoyed the first season a lot and look forward to watch the 2nd and 3rd.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Just finished High Heat and the latest Never Go Back. The plots are convoluted and filled with musings to show writer knows all the intracacies of the military. The action is sparse but you can count on our hero putting some big guys in the hospital. Agree with other reviewers that the series is losing steam. Nevertheless both books are on the best seller list. Why would Lee Child pay attention to our niggles.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story was very good going between the young woman in foster care and the older lady who had been on the orphan train in the 1920s.  Their trials and tribulations were very interesting and heartwarming.  Enjoyed it immensely.
6310292196|5.0|Great humor, witty and light throughout. You see individuals with noble qualities that almost seem unknown today - real humanity. Last but not least, possibly the most endearing and romantic ending of any movie I have ever seen!
141659521X|5.0|It is with much sorrow that we loose a great person in the height of his career.  I looked forward to reading the book as soon as receiving them generally within a day and then knowing the next one was worth waiting to receive.<br /><br />I am happy with Brian Haig and look forward to the way His publisher goes.
B0019X3YXM|5.0|It was in very good condition when I got it in the mail :) I love this movie, it's so cute!
1465414444|5.0|The book contains beautiful artwork as well as simplified information about the Lore of World of Warcraft. But because the book is simplified, the information does not specify details of information such as the novels does with Arthas' childhood and his horse Invincible or how Illidan truly felt when Tyrande chose Malfurion over him. I guess you could say that this book is just for people who are new to the Lore of World of Warcraft and who wants to get a brief summary of it in just 200 pages rather than thousands whether it be in the books or in-game content. I love the visuals the book contains which is a mix of the concept art, the World of Warcraft comic book's art, in-game art and etc. The books contents is categorized as:<br /><br />1) Introduction<br />2) The Chronicles of Azeroth<br />3) The Alliance<br />4) The Horde<br />5) The Pandaren<br />6) Heroes and Villains<br />7) Behind the Scenes<br /><br />Now the book's information isn't just about the MMO version of Warcraft but also the previous games about it. Although I have yet to finish reading the book, my favorite part so far has to deal with the Chronicles of Azeroth because of how the book explains the timeline as well as the important figures within that timeline such as the Titans and Sargeras, the Burning Legion, Ner'zhul and the War of the Ancients. Unfortunately, there is little information about the Old gods which is to be expected considering that they are still a mystery in the Lore.<br /><br />The design of the book is magnificent because of the hard cover and a removable book cover to have the cover of the book just show the design of the cover without any text. Just see the picture of the product and imagine it without having the title as well as the text in the bottom. Although the book still has the publisher in the back as well as the barcode but that's alright I guess.<br /><br />Overall the book deserves a 9.5/10 and 5/5 for the moment. Perhaps I'll come back to edit it when I finish reading the book.
B0007N1BBC|1.0|I am not familiar with the british dvd's and this dvd will not play on my machine.<br />I do not know how to return it so I can reorder an american version. I have watched this<br />dvd on netflck 5 times and that is why I want to own it.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I love this movie so much. That I bought it strictly just to have kept in the plastic. All was well with the seller  and his description. I have no complaints there. It arrived in a timely manner.
B005UG542S|5.0|Great film. Great visual effects. Read the books, though. There is so much detail that the movies can't possibly capture.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really fun and makes you really use your brain to think and I like the helpful clues , can't wait for the room 2 to come out!
B00EHMG358|5.0|Preston and Child are masters at their craft.  This forthcoming book is just another wonderful story from the Gentlemen.  This one will prove to be all we expect it to be - especially in light of the first 9 chapters!  Bring it on!
B000I2J6K0|1.0|I bought this based on the reviews but was not impressed.  The workout had way too many squats for my bad knees, and the filming was terrible and very distracting.  An unfortunate waste of money in my book.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Into Darknes is brilliant linking the past crew relationships to the younger versions. 3D is wonderful a real edge of seat thrill ride.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|The modern cast of Les Miserables has done a fantastic job ... I doubted their abilities, since they are primarily actors, but they are awesome!!
030758836X|2.0|This is awful. I bought it a year ago and I could not get through their annoying wining and b****ing. AND you have a pretty good idea of what is going to happen at the end. Such a fake stupid book.
1617751588|5.0|It was thoroughly enjoyable and made me laugh a lot because some of the things are exactly what cats do. The drawings are very descriptive also.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|Awesome film of course came in mint condition and on time, just the way I like it. Action packed film!
B00E0SX118|5.0|This was way better than expected.  I expected the trailer to be the end of the laughs, but they just went on and on.  I have a friend at work whose wife cried at the end because she thought the hero might die.  Good story, lots of laughs.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been in love with King since I was a young Lady and almost 30 years latter I still am. This work is great, not edge of your seat scary like the Shining  but a good coming of age Stand by me kind of story. He had it then and still has it now!
B000NY17J6|5.0|When I received the cd I couldn't wait to listen to It.  It brought back so many memories of the 70's.  Ronstadt has a beautiful voice.<br />I especially enjoy listening to it when I am driving alone.  I find myself singing along with her.  I love it.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|A thought provoking, insightful and entertaining movie geared towards the adult market.  So nice to find films that are not aimed at  the Joe Sixpack mentality that wants nothing more than non-stop violence and depravity.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandkids love  this game. I seldom get to use it myself!!  A must have for young and the young at heart
B004LWZW24|4.0|Well made horror thriller from the people who recently brought us The Conjuring.  For fans of intelligent occult thrillers who can do without the predicable baggage found in those &#34;beer-guzzling teenagers at some deserted summer camp&#34; (etc) epics that the made-for-video studios churn out with monotonous regularity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow. What an unexpectedly good picture!  Easy and quick to install from iPhone and Windows 8 PC. I love this thing.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|DVD worked fine.  Loved this movie.  Very Funny.  I can;t really type any more about the movie but have to since review has to be so long
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Takes me all the way back to High School. There isn't a better Pink Floyd Album ever. Just need a black light.
B008C20TDG|5.0|We had the opportunity to meet Melissa and Dallas years ago (at early CF events/seminars, Burg's garage...) and always observed them to be be humble and sincere, very thoughtful. I was impressed long ago by Melissa's remarkable writing ability on her blog. That easy writing style and well organized topics make for a perfect read. This book is an outstanding compilation of well supported scientific data, personal research and anecdotal evidence supporting a natural food approach.<br /><br />When combined with the Whole 9 Life website, this book is THE primary option for the athletes we coach. Regardless of age or level of athletic ability, the natural food intake the book recommends has benefitted literally every person in our gym who has stuck with it. Maintenance of lean mass with exceptional loss of body fat is the norm rather than the rarity. Almost eight years of running a CrossFit facility have given us the chance to work with multiple nutritional programs, watching our athletes and ourselves improve, or not... It Starts With Food gives you the information you need to really turn your health AND fitness around. Get it and stick with it!<br /><br />Steve<br />CF Marina
1250006341|5.0|I found this book through a general search on PBS.org, but it was too expensive.  I found it on Amazon for much less!  It made a fabulous gift for &#34;Best Dressed&#34; at my costume party.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|If North Korea is even remotely like this, then everyone of us reading this book somewhere besides NK should be thanking our lucky stars.  I've never been able to reach much violence but am a big fan of Cormack McCarthy as well and this fellow is as stark and moving as McCarthy, easy. I as hooked from the first page even though I had a hunch we would eventually lose our hero.  I have never been so in tuned with everything a character does and feels, almost sensing what he will do before he does it...because it is exactly what I would do, as I was with this central character.  I so look forward to reading more from this author.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Wonderful ending to a great story. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much, although we have very different tastes in fiction.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey is beyond amazing - well, the entire cast is unbelievably awesome.<br /><br />Fast-paced, many twists and turns.  I do not usually like that &#34;talking to the audience&#34; affect but I believe, in this case and the story line, the audience really needs to know what the heck is going on in that mind of his !<br /><br />Can hardly wait for Season 2 and am sad to read it will be not be available until early 2014 - how can I wait that long ??? !!! ???
0553805371|5.0|Great book, I finished in 4 days, it was impossible not to stop reading it. A great book as usual comming from Stephen Hawking.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Once the remix came out, I had to check out the whole album. It is amazing and her lyrics are poetry!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Great movie! So entertaining and great cast. Romantic& funny. To be able to go back in time in the most romantic city in the world& meet writers, painters& fuze them with modern day love story....Woody Allen is a genious when it comes to movies!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love this game, it came so quickly and the product speaks for itself. It has brought my friends together and torn us apart (in a good way) so many times. Love love love
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|An amateurishly written and edited book.<br />A decent plot, well sort of - pretty predicable.<br />In the hands of a skilled writer and someone who actually knows how to edit and make recommendations this theme could be carried through additional future books. Unfortunately, I won't waste my time because as we all know &#34;Time is money&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hours of fun for all ages. You'll get addicted to it the first time you play it. I really hate having word minimums on reviews.
B00EGSENP0|1.0|MOCPINC is insane and trying to take advantage of the low information buyer, this mouse is between 98.00-108.00 all over the web including Amazon and they want 9,000.00+ for it. now think would you buy ANYTHING from this group sitting in the shadows to rip you off ? if you do you deserve it. Good Luck
B00AEBB8FQ|4.0|Fun and witty combined in an interesting script that could have gone extremely wrong if not in the hands of amazing actors. Robert Downey Jr. at his best!
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Love this album, love this band. Every song is a hit. Can't wait for  the second part. Hope the next one is as good.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love Diana Gabaldon's writing style.  This series just takes me away - this is my second time reading the series and I love it as much as the first time!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A match three game. It is fairly simple. A lot of chains to break matching 3 or more items. The colors and graphics are amazing. I highly recommended playing this game.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I stayed up until 4.00 a.m playing  zookeeper dx it was so much fun I have fell in love WOW
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Saw this in the movies  and again I watched it with my amazon prime membership and It was great! Its a Must See!
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|When I first heard YOUR LIFE, YOUR CALL on Sirius/XM, I came home told my wife about it immediately. It is a standout track in a really nice, smooth set. It first struck me as something that would go well in the soundtrack of an angst-ridden thirtysomething movie or TV show. I have since learned to appreciate the whole album in bigger ways. If you're looking for life-changing stuff, this is probably not it. If you're looking for something really pleasant to relax with, this could be the ticket. If you're looking to place it in a sub-genre, try listening to YOUR CALL in a set with Beck's I WON'T BE LONG and Phosphorescent's SONG FOR ZULA. All pretty pop for grownups....
0345803493|5.0|This is the continuation of the relationship between Christian and Anastasia.  The relationship is now one of more depth and not just a contractual arrangement.  You begin to feel the struggles of Christian as he realizes that Anastasia means more to him than just another submissive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the verbal banter that takes place as Anastasia clearly is far more outspoken than what Christian is used to. However, as the relationship becomes more and more serious, so does the sexual drama.  I would say that most might blanch, but somehow you can see it as a process happening between the characters.  The &#34;hard and soft&#34; limits, if you will.<br /><br />I would recommend the books as a source of entertainment and who knows, maybe a look into your own sex life.  Not saying that I would want to go to some of the lengths in the book, but it does open your eyes to some possibilities.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I downloaded this app so that I can access the music I had on my current amazon cloud player and it was so great to be able to access all my music using this free app!! Now I can listen to my favorite songs on my phone whenever I like. :) Beautiful!
0345803507|5.0|After hearing all the discussion on the books, I finally decided that I needed to read the books for myself.<br /><br />I read several of the reviews before purchasing the final two books.  I had originally bought the first book not realizing that there were two more books.  After careful consideration and having loved the first book, I bought the final two in the series.  The following are just some of my thoughts.  First, the books were meant to be entertaining.  If you want to read serious, then read &#34;War and Peace.&#34;  I have to admit that when I first started to read the books my face, I am certain, turned bright red.  The language is quite salacious, but after awhile you finally begin to get involved with the characters and the sexual events get less and less shocking.  However, there were times when you felt you needed to splash your face with cold water!<br /><br />In the beginning, you might think its just the shock factor that keeps you reading but after awhile you want to know how the characters will survive the traumas that they face.  How can this story possibly have a happy ending?  Yes, it is filled with mind blowing sex acts but at the same time it is a story of redemption and the hope of saving a life marred by abuse.<br /><br />I found it to be my guilty pleasure.  I think, on some level, many women would like to find a &#34;Christian Grey.&#34;  Oh, don't get me wrong.  The extreme part of the character no one in their right mind would choose to experience.  However, I think a gorgeous billionaire, who would want to place the world at your feet and worship everything about you, might just turn your head.<br /><br />In final, as an educated woman who typically reads the &#34;War and Peace&#34; type books, I found these books to be highly entertaining.  You might want to pass on these books if you find sexual topics embarrassing, but if you want to add just a little spice to your life....by all means, give them a try.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Puzzles are fairly easy and fun.  Great way to pass some time when you don't want to think too much.  But can be addictive.
B0061S073A|2.0|I used to like this app but it keeps turning off my WiFi not matter if I got it checked or not. So every time I exit the app with my password I then have to put in my password to turn my WiFi back on. It's very frustrating. I prefer zoodles kid mode, but it can't be found for the kindle fire.
1439152810|4.0|Really enjoyed the book!  It starts out a little slow but very soon you can't put the book down! Really enjoyed it!
B000002AGN|4.0|If you have any interest in jazz you should own this. This CD edition with AutoRip is a great value.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|Great read ,looking to start book 3 as soon as possible,as usual you cannot put the book down for a moment.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|What a waste of a good book. The movie as a stand alone movie with another name would have been good. They decided to make this the companion movie... and I say companion because it was not a movie about the book... It has a main character and there was a zombie outbreak, if you can call them zombies. It reminded me more of a 28 days later for the U.S... Something about Usain Bolt fast zombies irked me, not sure how then envisioned that after reading the book. It certainly was not what I was picturing in my head.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is not just for kids. It is harder than one would think. It gives me hours of enjoyment playing this game. I would recommend getting this game for hours of gaming pleasure.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|The movie was a run of the mill zombie movie in my opinion. The children in the movie were an annoyance in the beginning. Overall, it was ok.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This will always be a classic movie with great memories of Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke as Bert and the other surprising character.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I chose to read this book with narration, so not really reading it, but I think the narration gave it a great perspective.  Very clearly denoting the difference between characters,I did go back and read as well...<br /><br />The story leaves you wondering if anything really could have been done to change the outcome?  There are snowball effects all around us however at the age that this is written they seem so much larger.<br /><br />Can one person's minor actions, not the major life changing one's truly impact a person in such a manner?<br /><br />Interesting read and makes one think about how you interact with people each day as everyone has something going on in their life....
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Another winner from Sara Bareilles.  Great to play as a sound track to your life to make your days happier.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Boardwalk Empire was the only series I was watching on HBO, so I stopped HBO and ordered the box set.  You can buy several box sets for what HBO costs per year.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Paul McCartney. Need I say more?  Apparently I do because your comment has to be a certain amount of words. An album full of new and older more unusual pieces of music. Love &#34;My Valentine&#34;.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you love the HBO series Game of Thrones, then you're really cheating yourself by not reading the books. The events that take place in the books are crazy in comparison to the show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is just as riveting and captivating as the first. Being in the mind of Katniss and reading her thoughts directly keeps you constantly engaged.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|So what's not to love about this classic.  The drawings are classic, but somewhat dated.  The kids do not seem to mind or notice whn young.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book, the final installment of The Hunger Games series is heartbreaking. While the characters are made up and some of the situations are fantastical, the emotions and effects of war are portrayed in a very real way. An excellent book to read in your free time, but I will warn you, you might find yourself with a little more &#34;free time&#34; in order to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was very heartwarming eventhough I haven't read the whole thing, it is still all at the same time heartwarming , sad , and funny.
1427207267|4.0|The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because at the very end of the book the image of the pink elephant is missing. Great book for children that are in Pre K. The teacher at my daughter's school use it and has been very successful for reader starters!
B008Y212PI|4.0|a good game to let you relax and chill out. Easy to use controls and navigation. Certainly is worth the price for a few hours of amusement.
0439023513|5.0|The book arrived in great condition and with the jacket. Definitely enjoyed reading through this book without any distractions from usage marks or any of that. Thank you so much!
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|Meanders a bit. Most compelling re stress and attachment impacting future health & learning. Ending is less valuable for parents, more for educational policy makers
B00338CMTI|5.0|My book arrived and looked new! It arrived with the book jacket and it was great. Thank you so much!
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|As a mom of a gymnast I related to this book and loved reading the story about my favorite olympic gymnast!<br /><br />However, I have been so disillusioned by the bitterness and jealousy by other gymnasts and people who question her story or her motives. People can be so cruel. I know from personal experience growing up how a child's heart can be so crushed when you are truly a good and kind person and the people closest to you are constantly hurting you. I also know how it is in a gym where, especially male coaches, treat some girls one way, and other girls completely different. Especially where parents are involved (or not involved). Bella and Marta treated her badly because they knew they could get away with it with Dominique. They knew they had complete control over her and approval to push her beyond what she was capable of mentally and physically. I think Dominique got the very worst of him. And I am sure other girls were just happy it wasn't them.<br /><br />She is telling her story because it's the right thing to do. Because people should not get away with this kind of abuse of power. People are afraid to stand up to them because of the power they hold over gymnastics and I hope that changes one day ~ maybe Chow will pave the way, fingers crossed. So many parents are afraid to stand up for what is right with their little girls because so many male coaches let their ego drive their coaching and it needs to stop. These girls are not robots, they are little girls who for the most part will thrive emotionally, mentally and physically with more encouragement, positivity and support than constantly being yelled at, put down and controlled. You just don't hear from the gymnasts that see Bella for who he is and will have nothing to do with him only because they fear being ostracized. Obviously Bella is a very manipulative person so of course past olympians don't want to speak out about him out of fear, STILL.  And, maybe some of them got the best of him.<br /><br />Most serious USAG gyms have one coach that parents feel aren't treating the kids right but are too scared to make waves. I see with my own eyes how parents put rose colored glasses on and see what they want to see but the reality is that some of these gymnasts are treated terribly.  As long as their gymnast is performing, the rose colored glasses stay on.  Sad. Parents, STAND UP FOR YOUR GYMNASTS!!<br /><br />By teaching your little girl that it's ok to be treated so poorly by your male coach can teach them that as they start dating and getting married, it's ok for their boyfriend to do it too...only you are not paying him to do it.<br /><br />I thank you Dominique and I am thankful that my daughter knows that you are my favorite olympic gymnast because of your adorable personality that shown through your kind eyes and warm smile. Keep shining and don't let the haters bring you down!
1451648537|5.0|The book arrived in perfect condition. It was smooth to read through without distraction from any page bends or scratches, as there weren't any. Thank you so much!
B0031RS44S|3.0|The author is English.  The hero is American.  The grammar is now American, lending a more authentic feel to the novel.  BUT, I get the feeling this book was written with a strong collaboration with an American - an American obsessed with the word \\"again\\", so much so that it became the redundant word in dozens of sentences.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book. Yes getting  peek into a man's brain WOW!!! Yes you want to hate him but you can't blame him for trolling the truth. Men probably think just like this, so I guess us girls should be careful what do with these men that talk to there friends. This was an awesome book. Great job. I would love to read other this about how guys think about us females.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Its like I was there. Loved it. Gorgeous view of the Grand Canyon. I'd like to go there now. Amazing.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|very touching story.i try to read all I can about this era.I think everyone should request more movies like this.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Everything about it was either beautifully written or describe. I love how Cassandra pulls you into the story, instead of telling it!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I  would recommend this movie to anyone, even my male grandsons.  It is a classic!!<br /><br />What a great job of acting on all parts...I loved it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|At first, I was a little optimistic about reading it, now I'm completely hook and am looking forward to the rest of her books. She writes beautifully and her descriptions is so vivd. As a novice writer, I learn so much from her work.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|it is a really good movie, only thing was that arrived late but it was because of some shipping issues with my postal office. Other than that Great!
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Initially I found the book a little difficult to get into, mainly because of the style of the writing. Really pleased I persevered, this is a very well written book, great story line and well constructed characters.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very fun brain game that a lets you use get some brain activities done each day.  I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to have some brain activity.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun little time waster game with really nice graphics.  I especially love that I got as a daily freebie
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Awesome album...definitely measured up to and beyond my expectations! So glad Trent made the decision to make a new record!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loving this book, very practical and hands on, not all airy fairy, try it, you'll be glad you did :)
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Wonderful! Once again, Trent Rezone delivers a superb album and Mariqueen's vocals are excellent. Wasn't sure if this album would be good, but it was much better than expected and definitely outshines their debut album by a landslide
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never have I been more interested in the goings on of an estate such as this - at least since the film Howard's End.  I'll bet this series is as fun to film as it is to watch!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This App Is Very Helpful.Many Sound Options To Choose From,You Are Able To Mix The Sounds And Co.trol The Volume Separately
B00701QVVY|5.0|OVERKILL IS PROBABLY THE MOST UNDERRATED THRASH BAND OF ALL TIME! EVERY ALBUM THEY RELEASE IS GREAT METAL AND THIS ALBUM \\"THE ELECTRIC AGE\\" IS NO EXCEPTION. THE MUSIC IS FAST AND BRUTAL! AND IT DELIVERS JUST LIKE OVERKILL ALWAYS HAS. I THINK THEY ARE AS STRONG NOW AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN THE PAST \\"IN MY OPINION\\"... THEIR LAST ALBUM \\"IRONBOUND\\" AND \\"ELECTRIC AGE\\" SOUND FRESH AND NEW FOR THIS DAY AND AGE, JUST LIKE THE ALBUMS \\"HORRORSCOPE\\" AND \\"W.F.O.\\" DID FOR ME IN THE EARLY 90'S. IT'S JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE KILLER THRASH MAN! THEY ARE TOURING WITH THE MIGHTY KREATOR THIS FALL \\"2013\\"! IF THEY COULD JUST GET PERHAPS EXODUS, TESTAMENT, DEATH ANGEL, ONSLAUGHT, OR EVEN SODOM ON THE BILL AND YOU WOULD HAVE THE BEST LINEUP OF THRASH BANDS SINCE THE BIG 4! AND I COULD GUARANTEE YOU THAT IT WOULD BE JUST AS LOUD AND BRUTAL, MAYBE EVEN MORE SO....ENOUGH SAID...GET THIS ALBUM TODAY IF YOU LIKE ANY OTHER OVERKILL ALBUMS OR ANY KIND OF \\"REAL THRASH METAL!\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great, everyone should get one. Could not be more pleased. So much better to watch pen making and Netflix movies on a large screen. Worth more than the price.
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|KREATOR IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF MY TOP TEN FAVORITE THRASH BANDS OF ALL TIME, MAYBE TOP 5!....ANYWAY WHEN I HEARD THEY WERE COMING OUT WITH A NEW LIVE ALBUM I DID NOT GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT. I ALREADY HAD THE GREAT \\"LIVE KREATION\\", \\"AT THE PULSE OF KAPITULATION\\" AND ENEMY OF GOD \\"REVISITED\\" ON CD/DVD... SO I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO MUCH, BUT I DECIDED TO GET \\"DYING ALIVE\\" ANYWAYS BECAUSE I AM A HUGE FAN! I HAVE ALL THEIR ALBUMS AND I HAVE TO SAY IF YOU LIKE KREATOR THAN YOUR GOING TO LOVE THIS. THE PRODUCTION IS TOP NOTCH AND EVERYTHING IS CRISP AND TIGHT! THIS \\"LIVE\\" ALBUM SHOWS THAT THEY DID THEIR HOMEWORK HERE; AS EVERYTHING SEEMS TO FUSE TOGETHER JUST RIGHT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SONGS ON THIS ALBUM THAT ARE NOT ON SOME OF THEIR OTHER LIVE ALBUMS AND THERE IS A HUGE MIX OF (24!) SONGS FROM KREATOR'S GREAT THRASH CAREER! THEY'RE IS KILLER ARTWORK ON THE ALBUM COVER AS USUAL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS KREATOR ARE ON TOP OF THEIR GAME AND SHOW NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN, SIMPLY PUT THIS IS...\\"BRUTAL IN YOUR FACE THRASH LIVE!!!\\".
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an amazing game. It has many fun activities  and is challenging and exciting at the same time. It is addicting after a while though! You can earn the music video after earning a certain amount of points and as you proceed throughout the game you earn multiple more points after successfully completing each activity. As you receive more points, you continue to unlock the more characters. If you play the airplane game, it is very challenging. Just go to your settings and you can turn off the airplane game. So, order this game now. It is phenomenal
1416595236|5.0|This book's a winner. Terrifically entertaining, I couldn't put it down.  Nice action that keeps you engaged and wanting more. One of the best books in the series. Glad to see the series going out on top.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a science fiction novel and a good one. The protagonist is so young and extraordinary he makes you want to read. This book will change the way you look at children.
0062267787|5.0|I loved all the stories in this, felt they really added something to the series overall.  You can see a full review on my blog at [...]
1401938906|4.0|Am looking forward to reading this book, as its on a subject  we should all tune into. Easy tools for thought.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great story. Truly a lost artist.  Another good example of remaining true to yourself. Nice story  that is uplifting. Well worth owning or renting.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game! Great way to pass time, compete with friends and have fun. Love the graphics and the audio is great too!
0345529057|5.0|Totally addictive- a real page turner (all 5000 pages!) I think it is more immersive than the HBO series, but enjoyed them both.
B004L35GAQ|2.0|there was was only credits and half of the tracks were like 30 second tracks of idk . not impressed
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Good read.  Not a dreadful how-to book, but a good story with inspiring info in a mind opening way.  Lessons on respect, love and seeing the importance and value gained from other cultures.
B000VH3FV8|5.0|Simply amazing!  A must have for any real music lover.  Pure and timeless.  There will never be another Luther Vandross.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Well done, fast paced and featuring a phalanx of accomplished actors. I liked the premise and the story was a bit like the 'Russian Nesting Dolls.' Stories within stories. Morgan Freeman is so good he never appears to be working no matter what he's doing. Eisenberg and Ruffalo are always solid and Isla Fisher is cute, funny and very good at her craft. I am also really enjoying the kind of renaissance of woody Harrelson. Either directors have finally developed a clear understanding of his vast repertoire of talent or he's settled down and is simply a lot more cooperative. Whichever, he's in a hell of a lot films and he's a joy to see working. He was stunning in 'The Messenger,' 2010.<br /><br />All in, 'Now You See Me' was great entertainment. I had seen it in the theater and loved and it was almost as much fun the second time around.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This product met all of my expectations. I have dropped my Kindle twice and it protected it very well. I would recommend this product.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|Fantastic album of the 1970s... with songs to sing to and lyrics to remember.<br />Inspirational.<br />Uplifting.<br />ride down memory lane.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It helped out alot, and it was free. You did a great job great job kindle fire keep up the good work love it.
1452113432|5.0|found it to be a good kitchen helper and love the details and the illustrations that guide you along the way
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The ensemble is awesome. ANd though the script really deviates from the original book, it's still quite good. It's especially good at enticing you into assumptions and then turning them on their head. Characters I initially disliked, I ended up liking or at least sympathizing with. Good acting. I binge watched the whole first season. Can't wait to see next season. I hope it doesn't jump the shark because the last episode of the first season certainly makes that possible. Let's see how they handle it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my 10 year old, who LOVES horses. Its a huge hit. She says its totally awesome!
0385349947|5.0|Well-written and insightful. Honest. You don't have to agree with her 100% to find the book engaging and enjoyable and probably helpful in one's own lifelong learning efforts.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love Sudoku & I put this on my Kindle Fire. Very addictive. There are levels of how hard the game is.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This camera backpack is so much better then a camera case - holds more equipment, and is much easier to carry.  Great product at a great price, delivered as promised.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The game is fun and addictive. You keep going until you have no more lives to play with. Enjoyable pastime....
B002M85TF4|5.0|I've loved this musical since it came out in the 60s.  The HD quality is good, the sound quality is fine for my ears, and of course it has all the classic songs and dance numbers that make it fun to watch over and over.  I fell in love with Marion (Shirley Jones) all over again.  And it's a hoot to watch little tow-headed Ron Howard running around the town.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy, then challenging. Great game....my kids love it. Would recommend it to anyone who loves games/puzzles. Easily to get addicted to.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game but also hate it. I will be playing just fine and it will freeze up and quit. You can be playing and lose all the coins you had to play for a game. It sometimes wont give you the things you win. The one really good thing is you can play for free! !
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For such a small amount of money, it works like a charm.  Probably the best sharpener I have ever used.  After about 30 seconds of use, I can shave with my knife.  Enough said!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|For the last four years we've seen the TTB live at the Beacon every Fall and for good reason; take one part soulful singer/guitar player, one part innovative slide guitarist, three parts horn, three parts rhythm, one and half part keyboard and a liberal sprinkling of Florida swamp grass and voila, one of today's most exciting acts. R&B lives!
0739365681|5.0|I loved this book. I had read the actual book and wanted to see if I got anything different out of the audio...Not really, but it's still a great &#34;read&#34;. Probably one of my favorite Jack Reacher and Gang a@@ kicking's ever!
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I first thought the Bootleg series was little more than capitalizing on pre-issued material, but I've been happy with a good, consistent product the builds on Bob's legacy. Several good out takes and alternate versions here - take another listen to If Dogs Run Free.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is very well made and makes it very easy for a beginner to grasp the concept and learn quickly.
B00C2ISGQI|5.0|Great movie, exelent box, good quality. If you love the movie you must check it out. Mel Gibson and a xelent performance!
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|Acting good, special effects good, plot should be interesting but boring, dialogue cliche  and no surprises. Free is the right price
B005F9TQ9C|4.0|Great cd classic from the late 60s by Bob Dylan.. Think of it as a demo or bootleg album and wow! great music.  I recomment this CD for any Bob Dlylan fan.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I like the game it's a lot of fun the graphics are great for a game on a phone an my kindle fire never had any problems with it freezing up or any of that stuff just to get cool guns it cost out of pocket this one is pretty high I mean $5.00 don't get up anything cool it looks like you need $30.00 but I've been playing awhile an I'm getting by without buying anything with real cash let everyone now how far I can get for free
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love Star Wars II.  This version is much more fun and easier to play than the first one!  I would get stuck for weeks on end in that version but not this one - maybe only a day or so.  I'm really enjoying it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids Love the game I have several on my iPad and this is the one they play the most Their ages rage from 4 to 16 great game
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It looks just like the one in the show, has lights and sounds, and you can write secret messages with it that you read by its light. I got this as a gift for my brother,  but I might have to get another for myself!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent story, you fall in love of the characters, and you can actually relate to the situation in that new word.
1400032717|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and how the secrets came out which was surprising to me.  It made me want to keep reading to see how this young man was going to through some of his acts being very intelligent in a very special way. I would recommend this to others.  I must say the title fooled me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The story of the book got better with each passing book....In the end it was the reason why I couldn't stop reading but I felt a little dissapointment about the Katniss, I think I was expenting so much more of her in terms of the independent, fierce girl that we knew in the first book.
006224454X|5.0|Loved this novel. Great suspense. My book club read this and we all really enjoyed it. I would recommend  it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Awsome!!! how the story was more complicated that you could image....It was great to know the other characters a little bit better
1451620837|5.0|I really enjoyed reading his history but very sad to see him throw away everything he had to drugs and alcohol.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use this literally everyday.  Very simple and I like the large format so that I can easily see it.
1444737112|5.0|Rarely do I read books anymore about animals because generally, the storylines are so similar. Honestly, I picked up this book simply because I was amused that the cat, Bob, on the cover, looked exactly like my cat. How wonderfully surprised I was to settle in and find I was reading a rare gem. The author, James Bowen, writes courageously honest about his life on the streets, but at the marrow of his story is his cultivating relationship with Bob. James Bowen has an uncanny ability to leap Bob right off the pages and into your heart through his written words. However, not only did Bob come into my heart, but James, unknowingly (and I believe quite unintentionally) comes too. This is such a tender love story between one man and one cat; much different from most of the other human/animal stories I have read in that I could literally feel Bob's personality, as well as all of the emotions swirling around in James as his heart broke, kept hope, moved forward, and made a life for himself and his cat. James Bowen writes with a raw energy that carries you right into the tide with him. I actually missed this incredible pair when I finished the book. The fact that I was so moved deserves 5 stars!  ~MJFord
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very Nice game, played it for many hours and cant get enough.<br />From hard Puzzles till easy with different sizes. I like it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This changed my perspective about what happened in the Middle East during President Bush's presidency.  I let the left-wing media affect my perceptions and understand now what our military dealt with.  Thank God for the US Military!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|great story, great actors! finished the whole season 3 in just one day. Cannot wait for the next season. Totally a walking dead addict!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have read this before this is a very very good book, now that I have it on my Kindle I will have it forever
B005NAD6Q2|4.0|Very funny, easy read well worth the time to read.  Enjoyed so much bought the next three books.  Recommend has a bit of everything in it.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|way better than the silly movie. much more touching. much more truthfull about whats real and whats not. def check it out
0345803493|5.0|These books are so good. I couldn't put them down.  They made you keep wanting to read them.  Would love to see more of the way things turn out with everything.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|There is nothing out there that can do this for the price. It's just too bad can only do Netflix and you tube for now.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Ok for a star trek movie it was ...different.  I was entertained.  I figured out how it was going to come together way before the end.  If you want to add this to your collection wait for a sale.  I do like how they accurately explained away how they &#34;found&#34; Kahn.  So no Genesis Planet, no HORRIBLE startreck 3 the search for Spock.  And Hopefully they will do better than Shatner in Startrek 4 oops 3 if they do the whale thing.  Good special effects, acting is acceptable,
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I am a long long long time Santana fan.  I have been there from the beginning and upon a second and third listen this is on of Carlos Santana's best efforts in many years.  The musicians are tight and the guitar playing and solo's are bring back memories of the Carlos Santana in the early 70's.<br /><br />A must have for any serious guitar lover and deserves a place in any music collection.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Everything I expected and more! I am completely hooked on this series. Too bad it had to come to an end.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Another great offering from John Mayer.  He doesn't disappoint but has moved in another direction yet again.  He goes more western on this cd which took some getting used to but the lyrics and melodies grow on you as you listen.  The 2nd and 3rd listen had the cd really growing on me.  What a great cd from an artist who is continuing to grow and find himself as an artist.  This cd reveals more about the man behind the music than anything that he has put out since last years (2012) cd which I beleive is the best overall cd John has produced.<br /><br />Not a glitch in the voice either.  He has better range and control of his vocals that ever before.  Its going to be fun to watch him develop in the years to come.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with purchasing this cd.  My cat Sammy is a very strong critic of music and this one had her purring and asleep in no time which is the mark of a truly great cd.
0345806786|5.0|I saw the movie 100 years ago and LOVED it. 'Fell in love with Jack Nicholson's talent. the story line all of it. But I never read the book....until now. WOW! No wonder they made a movie out of it. And even better, I am on page 124 reading the sequel, Doctor Sleep. If you choose to read The Shinning, plan on the sequel right after it. Stephen King picks right up where The Shinning lets off so the continuation really works. I am now a Stephen King FAN and plan on reading Joyland next!!!!
1400069807|5.0|Mioss does an excellent job of showing the influence the big companies have had on nutririon choices in the U.S.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|But it doesn't take long to get through the whole game, can't wait until they add more to it. The first Star Wars is my favorite Angry Birds game but I'm sure this is a close second.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Nice to see a movie without non-stop computer graphics and so much violence. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith movies and shows never disappoint.
0307949486|5.0|This is the most enjoyable work of fiction I've read for years. It is the first volume in the Millennium trilogy.<br /><br />The journalist Mikael Blomkvist from the Millennium magazine, who has just been sentenced to three months' imprisonment for libel of the businessman Wennerstr&ouml;m, is commissioned to look into the disappearance, long ago, of a young girl called Harriet Vanger.<br /><br />Reluctantly, Blomkvist starts looking into the matter with no expectation of success, and eventually teams up with Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant though eccentric young investigator. She is highly intelligent, a gifted computer expert and absolutely the best hacker in the country. Due to her unprecedented skills she has an uncanny ability to delve into everyone's dark secrets.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander has been abused in her childhood and had to learn how best to defend herself. She is a fantastic personage. Perhaps part of our fascination with Salander is our sympathy for her background and the fact that she has been unjustly deemed to be retarded when in fact the opposite is the case. Also, when badly treated/abused she has a deeply satisfying ability to take exact revenge and has no qualms in doing so, though we ourselves would probably have refrained from following her example for moral reasons even had we been able to do so.<br /><br />Blomkvist is a sympathetic character too and he and Salander make an unlikely pair. They are led into life-threatening situations but eventually solve the mystery of Harriet's disappearance. All the loose ends are brought together and the book has an extremely satisfying and amusing ending.<br /><br />It is very rare for me to laugh out loud even when reading a hilariously funny book but when reading this book I laughed out loud on several occasions. Salander is such an exceptional, amusing and amoral character.<br /><br />The book in English translation is mostly absolutely well-written and presented in satisfying detail. It is engrossing and though a whopper of a book it won't take you long to get through it. Don't miss it or the other books in the trilogy.ing and though a whopper of a book it won't take you long to get through it. Don't miss it or the other books in the trilogy.
158270208X|5.0|I had an earlier version of this.  I like the size, the feel of the paper and the little reminders and words that adorn the pages.  I am glad they still make it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it all the time for recipes, party planning, wedding planning, home decorating ideas, travel planning, and the like.
B001706I5I|5.0|Really like Jim Carrey. Watch throughout the year not just Christmas. Always cry at the end; I want roast beast.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|At first I thought, oh no! a sequel.  They almost never work out.  Stephen Kings has come through again.  I had always wondered what would have happened to Danny, Wendy and Dick.  So glad it worked out the way it did.  Thanks, Stephen for another great read!
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|Another great album from Cher, happy to add to collection. She is the BEST/the queen of music.  No one else comes close
0099519852|4.0|Great book!!! Understanding why some places just produce amazing talent. You will think differently about what is talent after you read this book.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I have one of these units on my mountain bike and my Polaris quad for attaching my GPS. Unit is very sturdy and never slips regardless of the abuse I put these vehicles through in off road riding conditions. Strongly recommend this product.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun game and I enjoy playing it. I enjoy all the Angry Birds games and this one is as good as the other Angry Bird Games.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|If these be demi-gods, then, oh, the pity of it and of all who would be giants and oppose them.  Which sounds deep and the things is not deep.  It's an entertainment, though, full of melodrama, cuteness, the joy and stress of superior abilities, and pride in your blueness.  When you are in the mood for that, enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A really good read, thoroughly engrossing, mesmerizing even. Please give your most sincere accolades to the writer of this book.<br />Geraldsmith13@gmail
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Not my favorite, I usually love Diana Krall’s versions. This here seems a bit constructed. The music matches the picture. (Does she really need that?)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great insight on how to communicate love with your significant other. Would recommend it to everyone, even if there is no problem in the relationship.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|As an special event/ wedding photographer, I was in need for something that would allowing me to carry my second body while still be able to switch (from camera to camera) with relative ease...  I tried the double strap approach but found the bodies would swing and became too cumbersome.  Sorry, not for me!  ...then, viola, found it.  This system just works for me & I think you'll like it too!  Please note, I picked up a second pin (sold separately) and wrist grip (not included) for my two bodies.  Hope this helps & good luck!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book is ok, kept my attention, was lookiin for a lot more on the kills but you get this
B000BYA5GE|5.0|I enjoyed Mr. Cages and all the other actors performance.  Good plot. Plenty of action. Over all good entertainment. Awesome movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|have never really played it so I can't really rate it for you so if you play it rate it for me
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app has opened one more avenue of communication with my 10 year old grandson. He is very into the game and we're enjoying it together.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book, love all the detail, couldn't put it down, went through it so fast eveyone should read this book
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have been enjoying this game all day. I'm not good at math or logic puzzles, but this has been  fun.
B0063IH60K|3.0|never played it, can't really rate it for play or not so give it a try  and rate it for me
B006FE83UE|5.0|I have always loved this movie, but the DVD holder on the inside of the package was broken. Since it's a 2-CD package, It makes it very awkward trying to keep it from rattling around loose inside the box.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is a great show. Its so much better without commercials the pacing of the show is so good. The beginning of the season isn't great but it really picks up as it goes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ready for an update-really enjoyed playing this game-I was disappointed when I finished!  would recommend to folks who enjoy puzzels
B00AUBFM70|2.0|Book Looks like it had some water damage and the binding inside the front (Hardcover) is Broken. Shipped in and envelope. For a book this size it should have been a box.
1416955070|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I read it after the movie so it's hard when there is many events that happened in the book and not the movie. I am so glad that I went to see the movie because now I have a new series to read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A little easy but fun to pass the time. Enjoyed playing the game. Would be good to add a few more levels.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like the game. It is not the birds that are angry. It is my skill that causes anger. I would recomend.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Bankers protecting bankers protecting bankers.  Its all you really need to know.  Smarter and more cunning than the politicians that let and ever encouraged them build this house of cards.  Both are protected and we're left to suffer the consequences.  Not as detailed as some books but a great guide to the problem and unheeded warning signs. Unfortunately, I think the piper has yet to be paid.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Great movie.  My 2 yr. old niece loves it.<br />Wants to watch it all the time.  I like animation movies for children of this age.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A great modern version of a very old story.  Action packed from the start and very well casted.  Sir AC Doyle would be proud of this interpretation of his works.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Love this. He was such a magnificent artist.  There will never be another Michael Jackson!!!<br />He was a very kind person.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for any DBZ fan.  Looks even better than I expected.  I highly recommend this for sure.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is awesome, definitely good for passing the time! I would definitely recommend this game to everyone! Very entertaining!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I tough it was going to be a good movie, because the trailers, but so many mistakes and clichés that made me lost interest while watching. So poor original writing and scenes and mistakes that not make sense.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Lots of thought went in to it, love the star wars theme, love how they integrated the two. Thank you.
B002752NGA|5.0|It is good to see the ladies do their part in the action  movie.<br />This lady take care business in a manly way.<br />She kick butt.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was so good. It really touched me and it was very emotional. I love this book so much.
B001P36OY2|5.0|This is my man of action movie I just can't wait to see the new one.<br />I love it action set ups.<br />A man of surprises.<br />I can not tell what I like or dislike no dislike. Just a great movie
B0060QM09M|5.0|As a small farmer, I really enjoy hearing about mr. Herriot's adventures with animals! I can't wait to read the next book!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was an unusual for me move a little slow, but caught on fire at the end about.  This one of the movie I will see again.<br />Any movie that keep me interested is a good for my attention.<br />How that young guy got out of that car.  I could not figure that out.  Now that was interesting to me.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|I JUST HAD A FALL AND BROKE MY ARM. SO GLAD IT WAS THE LEFT SO I COULD STILL MANAGE THE CD PLAYER AND THE TOP TO THE JACK DANIEL'S DECANTER. I'M SPENDING TIME EASING THE PAIN WITH JACK AND JOHN. BOTH WARM AND MELLOW. THIS ALBUM WORTH THE WAIT. LYRICS THAT EVOKE DEEP EMOTIONS.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A must see movie if you like action.<br />I like the Actor.<br />I did not see anything to dislike about this movie.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory never disappoints....  Her novels are true storytelling but well researched, written in flowing high quality English.  It's refreshing to read a great story without profanity!
B00F91H15W|1.0|Characters are boring and crass and completely unsympathetic. I rarely turn off a movie, especially one I have rented. But this one didn't deserve  a moment more of my time.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory never disappoints....  Her novels are true storytelling but well researched, written in flowing high quality English.  It's refreshing to read a great story without profanity!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the adventure, romance, intrigue, and the total erotic feel of the book.  Very interesting. Thank you very much.
B007V65R54|3.0|I found it difficult to stay interested throughout this book.  It could have moved along much more quickly and still retained its messages.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am a romantic, and I loved the way he loved her, and she loved him.  I loved to be able to escape in the romance.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I am one of fans of Justin Hayward and the Moody Blues. Unfortunately most of his and also the band's CDs and DVDs are not  found here. Therefore, I have to order them via the Amazon.com. Thank you<br />Sibel
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy, I did not want it to end.  I read them all several times.  It really took me away.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was lucky enough to snag this deal when 3 months of Netflix came with it. Just about pays for itself. Lets my friends control music and videos when I have parties. Also helps when my parents visit and want to look at things like pics from their latest trips.<br /><br />Not a necessity with the growing tech in tvs, but this is a nice piece of tech to have on hand!
B001VS46DC|3.0|Not Diana's best CD.  I have all her other CD's and love her music but Live in Rio was not my favorite.
006113127X|4.0|A very quick read.  If you are unfamiliar with Bukowski I would recommend this as a good place to start.  A series of short stories about losing jobs and failing relationships. Dark and filled with real characters
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Good actors, but no one seemed at ease with their character, it felt contrived throughout.  Lots of hoopla & show around a thin plot.
0062238868|5.0|I don't read a lot of novel type books anymore, I just dont have the time.  But a buddy told me about this book so I bought it and it was a good choice.  Very gritty and action packed.  I like how the author mixes his military experiences with home life.  Great book.
B000059TFO|5.0|this movie is still good...all these years later.  Gene Hackman is superb, and Willem Defoe is the perfect alter ego to Hackmans bulldozer.  Of course the 'race tensions' atmosphere and the nasty murders were the point of the movie, and well represented.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the others. Am sad to have to wait for the next one. If you liked his other books, this one will not disappoint.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Not only is he happy to have the movie ni 3-D, which is pretty amazing to watch sitting in your own home, but he now has the latest phaser to add to his collection!  This one is not quite as interactive as the ones I have given him from Master Replicas, but the price tag is not as steep, either.  It is a pretty substantial weight and does have one moving part...it is how they used to switch from stun to kill back in the day.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|I listen to my children's preferences of &#34;old&#34; movies and decided to surprise my son with this video for his birthday.  The price was great and the movie was perfect!
B001TH16DI|5.0|He has been waiting for the Blu-ray set to come out and is not disappointed.  Neither is his wife, who also happens to be a Trekkie!!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|My daughter loved watching this movie on TV, so I thought I would buy it as a birthday gift for her to enjoy years down the road.  She loved the surprise!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I'll be the first to give this one a 6 stars review! If some can give this great new  cd a 1 star review & not  even have purchased  &  listened to it  &  just simply  & ignorantly used another  reviewer's review then why can't i do it my way?<br />I actually purchased & listened to Elton's the diving board & i totally agree with the majority of the real top professional music critics that this is one of Elton's best!!<br />IT ENTERS THE BILLBOARD TOP 200 CHART AT #4.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter watched this movie three times in the theater and had to have this movie!  I saw the great price and had ordered from this company before and was pleased.  I will continue to order any and all movies from this vendor because the prices are great and the turnaround is quick.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|After seeing Boz this summer in concert I purchased this album. It is great & it is great to hear Boz again after all these years. What a talent & he gets better with age!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I loved this movie. Very heart warming. Good story. We  hear so much about evil in our country...this is just GOOD..something done by good people for a great person.  Gave him his chance in life.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|For many intellectual Christians, the Bible is troubling due to its inconsistencies. This book helps to provide a logical explanation of those.
B00005N6RU|5.0|This movie was awesome!  Tippie Hedren is a wonderful actress and this is classic Hitchcock at his best! A must see!
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Didn't expect it to be good but it was pretty bad, worse than the first by far (and that wasn't great).
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I will have to say I have not been a fan of Taylor Swift until she performed on Tim McGraw's CD &#34;Highway Don't Care&#34; but &#34;Red&#34; is also an outstanding CD.  Keep up the good work, Taylor!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you love iron man you will love this game. Lot's of different armor options and weapons. Would have been nice to get the movie actors to do the voiceovers but still a great game.
0385743564|4.0|I got this book for my husband (who is a HUGE Sanderson fan) and he thought it was great. It wasn't his favorite Sanderson book but he still really enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|it was very good and can not waite for the next season to come out and would watches it again
B008LODRT8|5.0|Quick and reliable service as always. Will use this service again. Keep up the great job.  Have a great day.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Great game for all ages. The puzzles range from very simple<br />to challenging. You won't be able to put your Kindle down. Download for free and exorcise your brain.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|For some reason  I can not get my kindle to connect to wi fi, so I needed a way to download books and this cable did the trick.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|This calculator has more than I need.  I would prefer a plain calculator.<br />I use it though and it is alright.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Anyone that has seen any of the other ST movies will see the similarities with this plot. But still, the action is nonstop and it is a must see.  I would have given 5 stars but the quality over internet for an hd movie wasn't all that great.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Wonderful family movie. I would recommend it to anyone. Although there are some intense parts so I make sure to watch with the children to reassure them it's all pretend.
0439023491|5.0|second book in series. easy read, fast paced, good adventure story. this is a really fun read for teens and adults.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Awesome!!! Very well crafted and of course Season 3 was amazing like all the seasons before and to come I'm sure.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Simply put, I like this app for music.  The problem, it doesn't update enough on the mobile side.  When I'm on Amazon.com using my computer, everything is up to date.  Also, there is a significant lack of old-school 80's/90's era of rap.  Not hip hop, just rap to include west coast and hard underground tracks I grew up loving.  It wasn't always just NWA or Dj Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince...
0553582038|4.0|I haven't read the entire series yet and I have not actually finished the book yet, but what I've read so far entertains me.  Its a nice distraction.
B007JMW46U|5.0|It was a good book because it had a lot of action.<br />Also it was co and mysterious so it kept me reading
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Believe it or not, I was reminded of some of my high school friends, our antics and our loyalties.
B0035V35P8|1.0|Said new and WAS NOT!! Outside cover was a copy, dvd was from some library.. very disappointed as I was gonna give it as a gift
B0073PPNE8|4.0|I thought Nicole did very good job in this ( as always). Renee did a very good job as well . she never stepped character in this role. And  Jaude also did a very good job. All the actors.<br />For me it's one these movies you like to see every few years the story-line is very well told and so is the character development.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|It does what it does, but it does feel a little outdated. Combo'ed w/ my 7850, it runs most games on mid to high settings.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The only distraction when reading the first few chapters was to keep track of the many names of family members from multiple families.<br />Aside from that great read, & difficult to put down.
0684824906|5.0|It was a great book, I had a hard time putting it down, very inspiring, what a great president. I would highly recommend it.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Phenominol movie! A Stellar performance by Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. It's one of my favorite movies of all time!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I pre prdered this before it came out I had to own it . Since I love star trek hope they make another one after this one  I will buy it too if they do.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|A few months ago I developed knee problems and the only form of aerobic exercise I could do was swimming.  Several years ago I swam a mile a day, but found it to be boring.  I was not looking forward to returning to swimming.  I was pleased to find out that there is new technology, the FINIS, that allows swimmers to listen to music.  It works well and keeps me going while I swim laps.  It does take a little work to convert my ITunes recordings to MP3 files to transfer to the FINIS.  It wasn't difficult to do, though.  I also tried listening to audio books instead of music.  That was less successful.  I missed to many words.  On the whole, the FINIS makes me a happy swimmer!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|this is one powerful story.  It is sad to think that we as a nation were that unkind.  It is quite an eyeopener. Along with it the humor is wonderful.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|If you saw Avatar and loved it, this is for you.  When you listen to it you can see the movie all over again in your head.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|this was such a powerful story about love and devotion. Was is a terrible thing but out of terrible things sometimes great thing appear.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|This is the typical Cirque music, whimsical, different, and enjoyable.  If you own any of the Cirque Du Soleil music then this is for you.  Alegria is hauntingly beautiful.  One of the main reasons I purchased this CD
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My wife and I have always been great fans of Peter Falk and Columbo. Although I saw many episodes during the original run on TV, these are all fresh and extremely entertaining. And a plus is seeing many now-famous actors and actresses in their young days/young careers. If you are a fan of classic television, this is the best. Over 100 hours of solid entertainment.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This music follows the Burlesque motion picture to a 'T&#34;.  If you haven't seen the picture I suggest you do because not only is it a terrific movie the music is fab.  Cher and Christina are a unique blend of talent, but Christina belts it out of the park with her voice.  Like I said, this CD contains the main songs from Burlesque.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|We love this movie from our childhood and it was a treat to find it on blueray! My husband had never seen it before so this was a way for me to share my past experiences with him. Cheesy graphics and all! :)
B009LDD1X0|5.0|If you have watched and loved the show, this season is the best.  Especially the episode when Amy gets sick and Sheldon takes care of her.  It's a laugh a minute with this perfectly meshed cast.  As always they get into some of the most ridiculous situations.  The last episode is really special and sets the tone for this coming year.  It's a funny and perfect climax to a great, great season (I will not give it away, but expect a surprise from one of the characters.)_
B005S9ELVC|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie and sent it to my dad for his birthday. He's very old fashioned and picky and he loved it too!
B00F91H15W|3.0|It was a pretty decent movie.  Coppola spent plenty of time on letting us know that these kids were all about status and acceptance.  They didn't care what happened to anyone, just that they associated with celebrities and didn't get caught.<br />The best acting in the entire movie was Emma Watson who made vapid and self-centered hilarious.  It was great watching her wholly transform into the character of Nicky and really get off on all the attention.
B0002HZSE4|5.0|Beautiful and well made.  The black and white sets this horse off.  I love the look.  He looks much like a Budweiser horse.
B00BQBNK04|1.0|Love the music, but the editing on this release is terrible.  They chopped off the end of some songs right at the crescendo.  Who does that?? Looks like the \\"highlights\\" release would have been the better purchase.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|entering junk just because I am being forced to enter something in this box to get my rating to show up.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|This native Texan continues to fuse new sounds and influences into her bluegrass roots, so that each of her albums expands upon her strengths while offering surprising delights. Buy this album for its solid songwriting, and you will keep playing it for its astonishing musicianship! I have always loved Dylan's Simple Twist of Fate, and to hear Sarah singing new depths into the song, to the bluesy accompaniment of Nathaniel Smith's gorgeous cello, proves the promise of this talented young artist.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Thor was just an okay movie. I do hope part two comes over better with the story line. I was not that impressed.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I loved the original VT, I mean, it was a RUSH album right! This is a NEW album! Wonderful!!! don't think you are doubling up for nothing!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I love this movie.  I read the books, went to the movie and saw it and now bought the movie to keep.  I hope they make movies of the other 2 books.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Alma indeed has lived a life of privilege in the world of the mind.  In her stolid, unlovely body, she has traversed the world transfixed by botany and the secrets of the universe she finds there.  To a greater degree she has succeeded in letting sentiments \\"that are unpleasant or uncharitable, let them fall stillborn to the ground.\\"  This, her mother's edict concerns her adopted sister, the lovely and gracious Prudence.  The portrayal of even marginal characters is crafted with care and distinction.  This is a lovely book.<br /><br />Alma is a woman born in 1800, quite a long way from the regard of women as intellectuals.  Interestingly, it is her crude and greedy father who overlooks that distinction in order to raise her as a scholar.  To her father, the treasure of books he has bought from those gone bankrupt are another sign of wealth.  To Alma they are the world.  And in her time, into the world she goes, taking us with her on the cusp of the search for meaning in the natural world.  By the way, she loves moss.  I cannot recommend this love more highly.  It is a world of its own, and her regard for it elevates this book to legendary status for me.<br /><br />The book is not actually cerebral and it touches on our world of the heart just as deeply.  It is such a pleasure to not have a lovely, reed thin, beauty to follow as men fall at her feet.  I have nothing against the lovely.  Prudence is lovely, and she fascinating.  I just enjoy a female character who attracts with spark in her mind and the play of her perceptions.  And I do in fact enjoy the mix of the learned with the joys of the body in this book.  It is nice though for the sensual \\"porn\\" to come from plants rather than all from luxury.<br /><br />Anyway iIf you don't share the moss fascination, you will be intrigued nonetheless with this wonderful novel which I insist you read right away.  Ok, that is rude, just please read it.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Although I saw  this movie in the '60s, I don't think it's just nostalgia that made me enjoy as much again.  It ticks all the boxes of tension, love and authenticity and with the new movie, Rush, it's very appropriate.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author did a very good describing people and places. It was hard to put down. Amazing that although this was fiction, orphan trains really did exist. She did a good job with research.
0545101425|5.0|Carolyn McCormick is so good as the protagonist, Katniss. It's a listener's heaven. And the plot is pretty good too!
0345529057|5.0|I borrowed these books from a friend years ago and now want to re-read them as I watch the show. These books are so excellent, I recommend them to all fantasy lovers and lovers of the show (read them - even if you've seen the show, there's so much more in th e books!)
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Great with most of the songs that everyone loves.<br />Would buy it again...<br />I don't think you can get better CD's from today's groups.
8866135704|5.0|I use Moleskine for everything! I have a personal planner, a work planner, a journal, a sketchbook.....too much? They're such good quality and conveniently sized, what more do you want?
B00B22MJSG|5.0|Has more hits than any other CD I have.<br />Worth every penny for Computer and Cloud downloads.<br />Perfect as party Album.
0307279189|5.0|This book didn't make me love running, but it completely changed my perspective on how I run, why I run, and what I want to accomplish as a runner. Also, it's just in general, a compelling ethnography!
0307394549|5.0|It is a gift for a family member who requested it for the holidays.  The holiday season is usually a cookie making and exchanging time of  year and the author is great in the world of baking.
B00338QENI|5.0|True story and I never had a clue about any of this!! Wonderful book....full of history, scams, honesty, truth and sadness. Amazing story all the way around. I don't want to say to much and give anything away but, you'll definitely feel a little angry after reading this book.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Great classic suspense thiller from Alfred Hitchcock, one of my favorite movie to watch on a cold and rainy day.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This was my favorite album of the summer!! I even went to see him in concert this summer and was ecstatic that he performed a few songs from this album.
0553062182|3.0|I found it somewhat helpful yet it was difficult to read & I ended up only scanning some of it. I found it to be difficult to follow as it seemed she would contradict herself & used many terms I was not familiar with. I think she is on to something that I can relate to but didn't get the help I was looking for.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I've never seen the show before buying it on DVD.  It was on a whim.  I fell in love with Johnny Lee Miller playing Sherlock.  He's very entertaining.  Lucy Lui is also amazing.  I think it's a great role for her.  Very happy with the show and I look forward to watching season 2.  If you like mystery shows with a humor and sass, then you will love this show.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|The latest blackmores night recording is another chapter in journey that blends rock, folk, classical, and rennaisancemusic that is blackmores night
B00008LDPU|5.0|Even with the flops that followed &#34;the Matrix,&#34; this film was a welcomed addition to the story and well put together.  I recommend this to any Matrix fan who is into animation too.
B00DOQK2OG|5.0|This is a nice recording by the last incarnation of rainbow. Ritchie sounds great and the band is in good form. Plenty of deep purple and rainbow classics
B00594MB2M|5.0|Good movie, very French. It showed French culture and attitudes, it also had happy moments and sad moments. The movie illustrated the French attitude toward sex,as well. Not for kids, but good for adults who love all things French.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|My daughter loved it! They are her favorite group and she had more songs on the deluxe then her friends had
B00004Y6O4|3.0|Forget the disco music. This cd only have one song. The other are pure bolero music. Dont have the lyrics of the music  inside the box. The sound is good.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|My daughter has a Marware case for her earlier model Kindle and recommended it to me. I am completely satisfied. It is exactly as advertised, arrived very quickly, and is Purple so easy to find. I would not hesitate to buy another of this brand.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Stunning visuals, very nice period piece with some modern twists, good story, a little long, near the end but a Good movie
B0063GORYU|3.0|I love this game on my laptop but don't care for the Kindle version. Perhaps it is the smaller screen? The cards seem more jerky and don't move as smoothly. Also the card artwork seems too big and busy for the small screen... though I may get used to these differences over time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  Never boring and always exciting!  of course the minions are exceptionally funny and entertaining.
B00003A9QI|5.0|Portman's scores are really what make a lot of great movies. Take away the music and you would be left with beautiful imagary, but no emotion. This movie in particular, a great classic, would not have been complete without Portman's score. A deep and moving piano dominated score, it elludes to a romantic bygone era.
0553801473|3.0|its not a bad story line, but he puts to much unimportant fillers in the book to make the story last longer. could have said it all in a half the chapters and books.  After awhile you lose track of the plot and what the story line is all about. My family members could not even get past the first few chapters. Grate writer. just to much garbage.
0770437400|3.0|It was required reading for a school project but the story just wasn't that interesting. Unfortunately, I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well I had to wait for several weeks for delivery do to back order and another couple of weeks to actually try it due to moving. Well I booted it up today and installed the app on all of my devices; including my windows laptop with vista. I must say the installation process was very simple and easy; connected to my home WiFi on first shot.<br /><br />I'm in the very early stages of trying this device out, but so far so good. There was some lag and audio sync issues on my first stream attempt, but picture was clear. The Chromecast seems to have some serious potential and the introduction of more apps can make this thing AWESOME.<br /><br />Will follow up after trying out the apps and playing with it for awhile. However, for the price and the ability to stream right from your device to the tv ; I'd say its a must have device to add to your audfio/video enjoyment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a talented writer.  Really puts the reader in the story.  I can't wait to read her other books, and see the movies!  BJM
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Got this movie to watch with our grandson.  I think Grandpa liked it more than the 11 year old. Go figure!!
B009A87X80|5.0|I have purchased several copies of this beautiful CD as gifts for friends.  Eva Cassidy's voice is smooth and the tracks are wonderful.
B00BYISRC0|5.0|Haven't taken the first LP off the record player yet because I have to keep playing it over and over. I know the whole album and love every song.
B003G7164S|5.0|this album is the best of Dire Straits, out of the songs standart of 2'50'', great compositions, a jewel... buy and listen this LP, I say listen not heard
0060920084|3.0|Very negative descriptions of all the places he's visited...  kept waiting for something really exciting to happen. Almost didn't realize the story ended ... lacking a powerful conclusion.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|This game made my kindle freeze up!  I couldn't even shut it off, and the sound kept skipping.  Never had problems with my kindle before.  I just deleted the game completely!
B00005TQKQ|2.0|Although the product instructions were easy to follow, the results were not what we expected.<br />There was no change.  Very disappointing.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I downloaded SWF and I still can't play videos on my kindle!  So frustrating!  I hate it! Why won't it work??
B00ET7EON4|5.0|There is something absolutely perfect about this album.  The entire selection of songs fits together perfectly, one flowing into the next in logically sonic order.  I have found myself actually giggling during the bridge transition in \\"Do I Wanna Know?\\", because they've layered that song absolutely right.  It's gorgeous.  It's not alone, either.  After a few loops on repeat they've all (ALL) grown on me.  Lyrically brilliant; musically a step above the rest.  The evolution of this band from one album to the next is more than impressive.  These guys did this album right, and I'm left feeling grateful for it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros: Netflix, youtube, plays from my smartphone, simple setup, smaller than my bluray player (that is currently used for netflix only)<br /><br />Cons: no Spotify and only google play support.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|Woah Matt...  You shed your southern suave and went straight red-necky.  I grew up in middle Virginia and this guy is spot on with the rural white male persona.  Liked the story.  Liked the movie.  Good to see a happy ending.
B00CATSONE|4.0|An interesting, though brief take on the role of imagination in the life of Tesla and its possible application in ones own life. I would have liked a little more on the practical approach of applying ones imagination to ones own life. Hopefully in manner that doesn't involve dying penniless and alone, with all ones efforts and imaginings stolen.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Great idea to take the action out of an action movie.  Brilliant!!!  Clearly Bob Jr is tired with the role.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It is fun. Some of the power boosts are a little confusing but it is a good time waster haha.
B003HV0TN2|4.0|Intriguing, draws the reader in through clever use of suggestion as well as action sequences. A great story, looking forward to the next book.
B00E0W8RE0|5.0|Something to Remember was released in 1995 to showcase and remind the public of Madonna's strong balladeer skills and help her compete in the music landscape of ballads at the time.  This compilation also came out after the strong success of \\"Take A Bow\\" (her longest running number one on the billboard charts to date) and also came out right before Madonna's journey into the world of Eva Peron.<br /><br />This vinyl is on 180g vinyl and being released by Warner Music.  When the album originally came out in 1995, the only market that released a Vinyl edition was Germany so to get this album on this format has always been difficult for the Madonna fan.  This album was scheduled to have three singles in the US but ended up with two (three in non-US territories) due to a contract dispute with Motown which resulted in an official single release being scrapped but did leave us with one her most hauntingly incredible music videos.<br /><br />Warner Music had previously reissued many of Madonna's albums on vinyl back in early 2012 and this one is a surprising pick but nonetheless a great collection of music from this fantastic artist.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />Side 1<br /><br />  1. I Want You<br />  2. I'll Remember (Theme From The Motion Picture \\"With Honors\\")<br />  3. Take A Bow<br />  4. You'll See<br />  5. Crazy For You<br />  6. This Used To Be My Playground<br />  7. Live To Tell<br /><br />Side 2<br />  1. Love Don't Live Here Anymore (Remix Version)<br />  2. Something To Remember<br />  3. Forbidden Love<br />  4. One More Chance<br />  5. Rain<br />  6. Oh Father<br />  7. I Want You (Orchestral Album Version)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Still trying to get the whole jest of the game.  My grandson loves it when he comes over and has a ball.
B0056C6XIA|1.0|The main blade on this tool snapped off in short order.  The breaking point seems to be poorly designed and cheaply made.  In addition, the latches that unlocks/lock the tool are difficult to manipulate.  I would not re-purchase this item.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was great to read a book about the afterlife by a previous non-believer, who happens to be a neurosurgeon, and who is now a believer.  Most doctors have a scientific outlook and don't believe in God.  It was eye-opening to get a new view on this subject by someone who is very credible.
B000IZA9OE|4.0|It's South Park; what did you expect?  Well, what I didn't expect was a musical, but it is one, and it shows the talents that resulted in their smash Broadway hit, &#34;Book of Mormon.&#34;  Be forewarned, though:  the language in this movie is quite x-rated.
0307730700|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It helped me realize the true meaning of being fearless, but, more importantly, what it means to be a good human being.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Exquisitely well written.  In today's time and age, it's becoming increasingly impossible to come out with a story line and have actors/actresses whom actually fit and breathe the part together.  This is what happens and keeps you totally mesmerized the entire movie.  To follow one line of the illusionist is one thing...but to have so many directions to keep you trying to come to a logical conclusion to whom is doing what and be almost there...the point of knowledge, just to have that line close down fast.  If you want just an entertaining, fun movie that upon the end, you feel cheated because you think the movie was two darn short, either way, from the movie watcher to the FX enthusiast, this is definitely a movie for you. And with that being said; the cast was beyond superb for this adventure and fit right into the FX as well as the parts they portrayed.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie could have been made with a cast from any High School drama department. Such a waste of talent in a confusing collage of time-warping. This movie should have gone straight to Amazon Prime and am sorry I paid money to see it, which is very out of character for this viewer. Watch it and see for yourself after your local library has it in it's video collection. Two Stars= too yawns.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun game.  Easy to play and you can earn everything you need without having to actually buy anything.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|No matter what you may think of Clint, this movie will entertain you none-the-less. Though thought to be a sub=par entry to Clint's mega-hit genre, it's fun to see the guy brooding over getting old and disoriented as this is what really happens when &#34; your light begin to dim and you enter into old age.
0399159347|4.0|Really felt empathy for many of the characters. Did not anticipate that secret. Look forward to discussing this one at book club.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|James Franco make the wizard finally appear approachable in Oz. It's just a fun movie and an added pleasure in the F. Baum movie adaptations of his many books. Visually enhancing to the spirit, and a little more respect for the little people in the film. Just rent it, make some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought this game would be childish but I was so wrong. I'm 28 and I'm hooked love the graphics. I can't put the game down the only time I have to is when I have to recharge the battery of my kindle fire lol.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i love this app, it saves me money on sound machines! my whole family puts it to use daily and nightly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. Fast and easy to use, it is always there just a touch away. The display of your calculation before total is great for double checking your entry.
1451695195|5.0|My granddaughter (13) asked if I had read this book and told me who had written it.  Since I remembered<br />his father from the hospital, I was curious.  What an excellent book and how nicely done.  He wrote so<br />people without a medical background could understand it.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This product does exactly what it says.  It quickly paired with my iPhone and every time I enter my car, it connects immediately.  Great accessory, it keeps me safe on the road and out of trouble with the authorities.
0810993139|5.0|Our son enjoys reading all this author's diary books very much; so the book encourages our son to read it aloud to others. We will probably buy more of the books in the series, despite that they are available at the library. We were happy with the service we received from the book seller.  The book arrived in good condition, mailed quickly, nicely packaged.

B00DHHWXYY|1.0|This is a terrible interpretation of the famous novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. If I could give it zero stars I certainly would. Baz Luhrmann, the director, has remained true to the basic story and plot of the novel, but his selection of actors, the performances they deliver, and the tacky eye-slime that he has provided undermine the entire production.<br /><br />Because the sets and party scenes have received so much attention, I think it best to point out that they are too slick, too silly, and too shiny. Did every flapper in 1922 dance the Charleston as if they were a professional Broadway dancer? I think not. In the real world bad dancers mix with good dancers on any real world dance floor, but not here. Instead we have perfect dancers acting outrageously while not missing a step in scenes that scream artificiality. Every polished floor or car, every drape or staircase or sofa is overdone. Gatsby wished to achieve what the wealthy had attained as part of his quest for Daisy, so why would he have fallen for such glaringly overdone hotel lobby décor?<br /><br />In all fairness, Leonardo DiCaprio does a fair job of playing Gatsby, but unfortunately he is compared to Robert Redford's interpretation which is much more subtle and nuanced. Robert Redford play Gatsby as a tragic character who has pursued an illusion thinking that he has pursued his dream and in the final swimming pool scene the tragedy of expectations unmet is evident. DiCaprio is more surface and less substance in his performance so that in the final swimming pool scene the viewer thinks that another floating pool adornment has popped.<br /><br />Luhrmann misses the point as to what The Great Gatsby is really all about while he follows the basic story or plot line. He misses the sadness and burden of unrealized dreams.  It is also about classism which Luhrmann never captures. Joel Edgerton does a passable job playing Tom Buchanan, but his performance does not hold a candle to Bruce Dern's excellent performance in an earlier version of Gatsby. The wealthy can use their power for insulation, for insurance against harm, for keeping reality away, and most importantly, for getting their way. Dern captures this aspect of wealthy in a way that Edgerton misses.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire is an awkward Nick Carraway and his performance is almost silly in comparison to the more natural performance of Sam Waterston in an earlier version of Gatsby. Maquire plays Carraway as a wide-eyed intrusive, almost adolescent, intrusive observer whereas Waterston plays Carraway with more intelligence, natural grace, more worldly reflection and experience. Maguire plays Carraway like a newly hatched chicken, staring at the drama around him, never relaxing, never fitting in with any social ease. Waterston plays a young man but he has the background and intelligence to put the drama that is unfolding before his eyes in perspective. Isla Fisher does a passing job playing Myrtle Wilson but her performance does not compare to the outstanding job done by Karen Black in the previous version. Black dripped desire and vulnerability whereas Fisher was over dressed and doll-like, a piece on a chess board and not a real person in a real tragedy. But the worst performance of all would have to be Carey Mulligan playing Daisy Buchanan. Mulligan is unfortunately compared to Mia Farrow and comes up very short. Mulligan never captures the real vulnerability, the underlying fear, the neurosis just under the surface that Farrow captures in Daisy. Daisy is a crushable flower, she is not strong, she make poor choices, she wants to be directed and told what to do and Farrow captures this essence whereas Mulligan plays Daisy as a pretty ordinary girl who happens to be rich, happens to have selected the wrong husband, and now is in a fix as she falls for her old boyfriend.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in a world of struggle, hardship, and competition before he was introduced to the world of fame, glamour, and wealth. He knew that the rich play by different rules, they win, they take it all, they leave nothing, they are cunning, they use you up and throw you away. Tom Buchanan is the personification of this process yet it underlies the personal tragedy of the story. Poor people die and rich people go on cruises. Fitzgerald has this as a structural theme in his novel but Luhrmann completely misses this point.<br /><br />Are Redford, Farrow, Dern, Black and Waterston that much more accomplished as actors than DiCaprio, Mulligan, Edgerton, Maguire, and Fisher? Maybe so but the fault in this failed interpretation lies at the feet of an insensitive director, Luhrmann.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|When you get used to the controls it fun and challenging. Best I have played since my PS3. That's a fact.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This version of the great American novel, The Great Gatsby, is an excellent screen adaptation with outstanding performances by the actors. Robert Redford is able to capture the multiple aspects of Gatsby including his ambiguity and his dreams. Redford plays Gatsby like a poker player, as a cunning man who holds back what is going on in his mind. This makes him all the more human when we realize he has been chasing an illusion for many years.<br /><br />Mia Farrow is excellent as Daisy Buchanan; vulnerable, weak, uncertain, and fragile. Daisy is a complex character, feminine and flower like, protected by wealth and privilege, yet a prisoner of her bad choices. It is important that Daisy come across as an over protected, slightly neurotic, morally weak person since it has to be clear that Gatsby is chasing illusion rather than reality and illusion eventually vaporizes and brings about his downfall.<br /><br />Bruce Dern plays her husband Tom Buchanan and perfectly demonstrates that this novel is far more than a love story but is also about classism and the fact that money can purchase insulation from reality and avoidance of consequences that must be faced by those of the middle and lower classes. Dern skillfully reveals Tom's cunning and shrewdness.  Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson gives the best performance of her career. Sam Waterston is perfect as Nick. This is a difficult part to play since he is the confidant of all parties, he sees and hears all, yet he has to be unobtrusive, a shadow, and a reliable voice.<br /><br />The story is tightly structured with a likable credible narrator who has access to all parties. He observes this tragedy but he sees that it is not only personal tragedy but that wealth and privilege allows some to walk away from crisis while others pay the ultimate price. Overall this version of the great classic is the best produced so far and is highly enjoyable.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very nice version of the classic game.  Especially like the lovely blue Color scheme.  Bought by accident; glad I have it.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My only regret is that they didn't make this 20 years ago! Fun to put together and love that it comes with Marty AND Doc minifigures (including a skateboard for Marty.) I didn't realize until I constructed the DeLorean that you get a few options here: Mr. Fusion on back, &#34;Outatime&#34; or 2015 UPC license plate, the 1955 &#34;hood fix&#34; from Part III, and tires with red rims, ala the begining of Part III.<br /><br />The gullwing doors are a little fragile and it's hard to get the minifigures to sit properly inside the vehicle, but those are such minor issues for this overall great set. I can't wait for Lego to bring out a second BTTF set (crossing fingers.)
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I am a big fan of Downton Abbey with the multiple story lines and the sweep in time from the Edwardian era through WWI and the aftermath of the war with its profound efftect on previous social custom and norms.  The DVD lets you tune into that cast of characters and society so different from our time at any time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so I love this game and even horse lover's would like it to. Make friends, feed your horse, enter compititions and much more!So if you like horses this the game for you.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Funny & fun ... Robert Deniro plays a great unexpected part as a gay pirate captain.Our family throughly enjoyed it!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very AWESOME.  even hard at times. great game to play with the family. fun and puzzling at the same time!
B001I45UFC|5.0|The &#34;Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#34; is certainly one of C.S. Lewis' best stories, full of allegory, beauty, and truth, for all ages. I've read it numerous times, and every time it grows in it's profundity and grace. The story contains the incredible concepts of mercy, grace, redemption, and salvation, all found in the character Aslan the Lion. This is, of course, only one &#34;Chronicle&#34; in the series titled &#34;The Chronicles of Narnia.&#34; The first &#34;chronicle&#34; is &#34;The Magician's Nephew&#34; which immediately precedes &#34;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.&#34; There are several more that follow - all of them masterpieces, and worthy of holding the high calling of being considered world-wide literary classics.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Not as action packed as previous movies but was  still watchable. Waiting for the next Ironman movie<br />to see soon.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|It's based on the same idea as other shoot and ricochet type games, like Stupid Zombies. Only difference is, in this case, it's clowns high on energy drink that you're trying to one-shot.
B004TACMZ8|2.0|it is pretty much useless tried all settings and just get random readings. all so can't heat audio on unit.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|We're not usually McConaughey fans, but this was a good flick. Arkansas kids did a great job acting. You'll like it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Just a great movie!  Great story.  I also like how both actors (even though straight) are very active in gay rights.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a great family movie - cannot wait for the next one! It keeps you watching to find out if she makes it out alive.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|After I got this, I figured out how to fix my computer with Wi-Fi: but buying from Amazon is affordable and fast. Of course this is an Apple product and Apple only uses Apple - so not much to say about that. Amazon was fast to ship through Amazon Prime and the adapter was reasonably priced. Always nice as a back up, I suppose. Seems we can't function without computers these days.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I really enjoyed the special effects and the story line. Robert Downey plays a great part and I really like his attitude
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|sooo amazing get the app if u like the video or song what u have to do is save the life's of the dumb people get the app!!:)

B0070DOHQS|5.0|The best RDP app I have used on my old Droid 3 and Nexus 7 (1st gen).  I tried many of the other free and then free+unlocker ones and this was the best.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Great read to inspire outdoor adventure especially in the female population.  Very humble character and wonderful quotes on how long hikes help with reflection and finding your inner peace.  It definitely kept me reading.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Predictable but a good read. You wonder how everyone connects for most of the book. Each story had its own standalone value.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Sent for this DVD on recommendation from my daughter. So glad I did. It's everything I expected. Will definitely recommend this to all my friends. Fantastic
B00DJWV11I|5.0|OH. MY. GOD.<br /><br />This is one of those books that TOTALLY lives up to the hype!<br /><br />I didn't really think this book needed another review. I mean everyone in their mother has read it and reviewed it in detail. So, I'm gonna be brief.<br /><br />Emma Chase is an amazing story teller!<br /><br />This book takes you deep into the mind of a womanizing a-hole!<br /><br />He doesn't apologize about it, he owns it--until Kate happens.<br /><br />Kate is a strong, independent, smart, and very sexy (without knowing it) female.<br /><br />She is someone to look up to.<br /><br />I appreciated the writing as a whole for this story because it was very honest. It got gritty, it got tense, it was so dang sexy I was squealing when read some scenes.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down and I was rolling with laughter. I really tried to highlight my favorite quotes in this book, but I realized I was highlighting the whole dang book!<br /><br />Story-telling at its finest is Emma Chase be thy name!<br /><br />A fun, sexy, heart-breaking, and honest romance!
B00FFJN6SE|5.0|Listened to Oneohtrix Point Never's new album titled R Plus Seven.<br />It's really good! I like it even more than Replica, the previous album.<br />Everything is so spliced, and synthetic----moody and thought provoking.<br /><br />The fake choirs work perfect. Choppy sound cutting in and out work really well against the soundscapes in the back. I have almost no complaints here.<br /><br />Samples, experimental, ambiance, nostalgia, avant guarde---<br />If you like any of these things, or want to see what it's like, I would highly recommend this album!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Its incubus not ther best we all know s.c.i.e.n.c.e is the best, but its still the great incubus!<br />brandon boyd has definatly come into his wonderful new yet old self nicely love you incubus!

B0063M22QO|5.0|I always enjoy playing this game and this a fun version to play. Might be easier with a stylus. Waiting for mine to arrive so I can try it.
B000002VRZ|5.0|Also good , We really appreciate you guys having these cds. We thought<br />we could never listen to them again.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|well I find that this app works fantastic on kindle fire but..... its missing some effects that could be found on the mobile app for this.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I travel a lot and carry an Apple TV.  The Chromecast has the same issue as the Apple TV, you can not log into the Hotel internet due to no active browser in the unit.  You can get past this if you have the IP address which is easy with an apple TV but you would have to write down the Chromecast.  Once at the hotel, call the hotels Internet Provider help line and let them you what you have and they will connect it via the IP address.  This was the whole reason to buy the Chromecast as you were supposed to connect via your cell phone and the reviews misled me in thinking I could sign into the hotels network via my phone for the Chromecast.  this simply isnt true.  I hope this helps other business travelers.  the unit is great for the house though and takes up no room and uses a usb from your TV (if you have one) to power it up.  You control it via apps from your phone.  Good but not 5 yet.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great hidden object game .... not just a mess of a picture and it has goals and awards.  It gets progressively harder as you go along so definitely holds your interest. There are plenty of opportunities to spend real money in the game but the great part is you don't have too with a little patience.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so cool. It really makes you think, it's frustrating and fun all at the same time.  Lots of fun
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I didn't expect this book to be any more than the average thriller. I totally exceeded my expectation and more. The way the narrative works gives it a very particular way to keep you hooked on. The only recommendation that I have is to take proper notes on the characters since you'll eventually come back to them, but it's very difficult to remember who they are and what they're talking about if you don't have reminders.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the all time greatest blues/rock band.  I love these recordings a lot and listen to it quite a lot.  thank you.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very interesting and engaging from begin to end.  Good writing and quite clever how the story of each of the characters get woven together as the book progresses.  I loved it!
B00A8KZWVO|4.0|I love lana del rey but the record came a little bit warped, and it's basically impossible to hear the bass notes. Still, overall as expected.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Bigger than expected.  Works great.  It's a lot of fun with all the water shooting up.  Can easily accommodate 3 to 6 toddlers.  An old comforter was placed on the grass under the pool and it was great.  My granddaughter loves it.  Well worth the money.
B00F35BV64|3.0|With all of time and space to choose from, you'd think that there would be an original story line out there somewhere.  The new Khan gives the whole story away in a one scene monologue, the rest of the movie is fast moving action.  It is yet another case of adrenaline over content - how disappointing.  The 21st century tech & visuals make the movie - as if space is just another attainable destination.  Yet, relieved we didn't pay full price in the theater for this one.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|Classic Clint Eastwood. The &#34;Dirty Harry&#34; collection is a &#34;must&#34; sitting right next to the collection of Classic Clint spaghetti westerns
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wonderful fantasy novel - transports you to the magical, mystical world of knights, lords, ladies, and dragons.  Excellent - can't recommend it enough!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really enjoyable. Simple but takes a little bit of brain work. My kids have also enjoyed this game. Definitely will be looking for more like this one.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|I'm late on the Res Evil franchise.  Decided to purchase several to see what I've been missing.  The efx are top notch with more than enough ghouls and dog-like creatures.  Reminds me a bit of the Blade series.  Jovovich and Larter are also easy on the eyes for men that like a little superhero in their woman.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as it kept me on my toes and wanting more - but hated the ending.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|I'm late on the Res Evil franchise.  Decided to purchase several to see what I've been missing.  The efx are top notch with more than enough ghouls and dog-like creatures.

B00FGM0JTY|5.0|This documentary has several layers.  It tells of one man's struggles and his response to life's difficulties. It tells about one small town's unique influence on music. It mixes in some American history as the story is told. I lived in this area and was only vaguely aware of how this area was shaping the music industry.<br /><br />The beauty of North Alabama is shown through the shots of the nature that we are blessed to enjoy here.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun little time waster. Easy to use and understand. Great little tutorial for those who dont know how to play this kind of puzzle game. Lots of levels. Works well on my LG optimus
B00594XOZU|1.0|This stupid app won't work well. Every time you try to log in it doesn't work it says this is taking longer then expected. Try again later. When you try again later it still doesn't work. So upsetting
B00D5YNQWM|4.0|The over all content of the DVD is good. It was the band that was not too sure about the concept of the DVD. The interviews and the concert should have been separate and there could have been additional songs in the bonus section. But I did like the DVD.
6304806418|5.0|I love this movie and find the songs running round in my head for weeks whenever I play it.  And I do play it quite a lot.  I bought this particular copy as a present for my daughter-in-law who loves opera and she loves this too.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I did like this dvd. The band had my favorite songs on it. The sound and the picture are excellent and Eagles fans will love to have this dvd to their collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey Season 3, but was very sad about the ending. Hope I like next season - I read about it and am looking forward to viewing it.
B006Q2LTRO|5.0|I love this book. It is one of the most beneficial books for my marriage and family.  We use its concepts every day.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is in perfect condition, and one of my favorite movies of all times. Great purchase for me. Thanks.
B000066SBB|5.0|I love this music from Arthea, The music was clear , true to life sound!!<br />I would recomend this to anyone who loves Arthea Franklin!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good Tool but in Austria you're not allowed (at the moment) to download the app for android. So therefore minus one star.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Ok
B000VSBX34|5.0|Help! has always been my favorite movie, but now my 6 year old & 2 year old LOVE it too! They watched it all day the day it arrived.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It wasn't overwhelmingly great or bad either. I would say the first book is worth the read but don't hassle with the rest.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Love this product.  Very durable and it even has a zipper compartment inside.  Lots of uses possible but I'm using it for my pet products to keep them from being scattered about.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|When William grows up, he wants to be a writer for Castle.  This group of writers has spun a love story that has entranced everyone who has seen it.
0099579936|5.0|Love the book.  Now waiting to read the next one.  Also looking forward to seeing the movie. Just can't wait.
B0053O89KG|5.0|There has never been a more effective cast at presenting a love story on television.  It belittles the Emmys that they have not recognized the best acting on television.
B008JFUO72|2.0|Others have warned of this but I have to add: the DVD version does NOT come with an extra disc holding the \\"digital copy.\\" You are instructed to go to the Marvel/Disney website and have to download in vudu, google, or amazon formats. If you are one of the few who live out of the way of cable/high speed internet, and have the limits on downloads that come with every rural provider, you are out of luck...unless you can rip it yourself...
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle is the best love story that has ever graced the television screen.  The murder cases may be interesting, but they exist only as the jungle gym on which this love story plays.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|Excellent !!<br />I loved it, good story, outstanding music , Go your own Way, by Lissie and a very sensitive final scene...
B0007M22TI|5.0|Celtic Woman DVD...This is their first DVD release back in I believe 2004-2005 timeframe...Ever since I saw them on PBS, I have bought all of their DVD's & CD's...Fantastic singing, music, etc...
161655164X|5.0|A beautiful art book, I couldn't wait to get my copy. Plenty of conceptual work, digital paintings, etc., with minimal text aside from some explanations of the art. Well worth the money, this book captures the tone of the game. A great addition to any &#34;art of&#34; library.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|an article like this is the dream both for its quality and good price, really recommend it to everyone, great.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|It is a very clever game. You find most of the number right away and some of the others can leave you wondering. My grand children really do like it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm a fan of this kind of movies and what better than to see them in high definition in the comfort of my home
B00640UICA|4.0|I did like this game. Good for using the mind.  Will play for a while and then remove it and find some other one.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like this game but you have to make an account to play certain levels. And you have to make a link on Facebook if not you have to make a review
0345529057|5.0|I watched the first seat of GoT and was immediately hooked. I decided that rather than wait for the next seasons to come out that I would read the books. Now I'm just waiting for the next one.....
030758836X|2.0|Gone Girl is well written. 3/4 of it is suspenseful, intelligent and somewhat humorous.  So why only 2 stars?  The ending is VERY rushed.  It feels haphazardly thrown together with an anticlimactic finale. No one gets what they deserve and the characters seem unchanged even after the tumultuous events they face throughout the first half of the novel.  2 stars...that's how disappointing the ending was to me.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Really good writing, fast paced, believable plot twists.  The cast is interesting also.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
B005S9EJ14|4.0|A silly plot in many ways that gains a certain credibility through beautiful performances from a cast of actors who are not stars as such. Easy to bag out in many ways, yet impossible to forget simply because it affirms that the positive in people's lives.
1878424319|5.0|This is a great and inspiring book. I would highly recommend it. It will back you the best you, you can be.
0937381888|5.0|as a newbie everything here is great. there is a lot of info and it explains enough for me to get going.  written in a well enough approach to understand. some parts may be a little &#34;slow&#34; but this is not a novel.
1439190275|5.0|My friend lost 70 pounds on the Atkins diet. I bought this book to help me and give me information. I learned a lot. Very good  to prevent diabetes type 2. Taught me a  lot about the harm carbohydrates and sugars can do. I realized I am a carbohydrate addict. My son has autism it is also good for autistic and ADHD kids. Also for people with seizure. I am a nurse spoke to some of the doctors. Not good if you have kidney failure
B00FKSJ3YG|5.0|Anything with a guest appearance by samuel is a 5 star show.  I liked this one.  Its a mini-series so it isn't going to be avengers but it succeeds at its genre.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A good book - slow in parts, but like a spider weaving all the parts of its web together, the culmination of the story is not only surprising but really interesting.  A good read overall.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For what it does, streaming Netflix and Youtube, it does quite well.  But not nearly as smoothly as using the Netflix app on the TV or from a computer.  The picture is great but going from episode to episode is a hassle, having to do it from the computer or phone/tablet.  For now I use it for displaying my desktop.  I use my mini-mac or Roku for everything else.
159463176X|5.0|This is the third one we have read, and it was as good as the first two, which were of course about Afghanistan. Kite Runner was turned into a movie and was awesome, and the second book &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; was also great. He gets inside the person who is in the book, and although the books are sad, they are so riveting, you cannot put them down. We wondered if the third would be as good. It was so very good.There are times when you want to cry for the characters, and yet there are times when you just want to be there to enjoy the people in the story, they are soooooo real. The story is set again in Afghanistan about a family and the story continues through their lives as they are pulled apart and then some are reunited. But this is no ordinary story, it is so beautiful and almost overwhelming in its sadness, and the story of the children involved is heartbreaking. This guy knows his country well and he writes from the heart. What a glorious way of finding out about another story, especially one in which our military has been involved for a long time. You will love it. Put aside a good portion of time though because it is hard to put down.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Why is it that some of the most interesting and best written books I have read over the past few years have been by foreigners, mostly those whose native language would not have been English. This book, too, qualifies as one of those.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I am really not a huge zombie fan but this was a great movie! I'd recommend you to watch it !
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This extraordinary story kept you wondering what would happen and hopeful that something good could come of the relationship between these two very different but interesting people.  First you're up, then you're down and guessing right to the end as to what will happen.  It enlightened me as to the plight of people confined to a wheelchair and their outlook on life.  I really loved this book.
B005N09L5C|3.0|Read the book!  The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions about what is really going on here.  The book is written in a way that has you connecting with many of the things that are going on today.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The 3D version of this film is, for my family, enjoyable to watch.<br />We enjoy our Blu-Ray movies do to the better sound and picture quality.<br /><br />As for the &#34;extras&#34; on the disks I cannot speak to those as I have not made the time to view them.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|i would order again and will order season 2 i enjoy this series a lot good service excellent quality a lot of enjopyment watching season 1
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|this is in no way my favorite movie however it is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  The artistry of this film is very enjoyable to look at.  I also enjoyed the story.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I just started watching this via Amazon. Even though my sister loves the show and raves about it, I just didn't think it would be a show I would like. Boy, I was wrong. Its gritty, dark and pretty close on to realism. If you like True Blood, you would like the dirty-ness of this show. If you liked the old show, &#34;OZ&#34; you will like this as well.
0399230033|5.0|Stumbled onto this book when our daughter was an infant and it looked cute.  Turned out to be her absolute favorite, and is now part of any gift to new parents. Haven't found a child yet who does not adore this book!
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I loved, loved, loved it.  The film kept me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait to show it to my grandchildren.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I don't buy a lot of DVDs or Blu Rays but Star Trek TNG is that one show I can watch over and over.  I really miss a good show that has truly self-contained episodes that don't really have to be watched in a specific order or have cliff-hangers every single episode, such as Lost or 24.  This was good quality writing and for the most part, decent acting.  I'm looking forward to the later seasons.
B0059XTUXQ|3.0|I love Meryl Streep and she did a good job, but the film, as a whole, was very slow.  I was looking for a little more
B005544TRQ|4.0|I hadn't heard much about this services until my neighbor recommended it. My husband and I love all the HBO and Showtimes shows and we were hestitant because this show is on USA.<br /><br />The first episode was quite good. It moves along really fast, it's interesting, and entertaining. We have now moved on to season 2.
1401308201|5.0|I've seen the show in London in 2008 as well as more recently in Orlando, FL at the Bob Carr and got this book for my boyfriend before the show in Orlando. We read through it and got a little bit of background with pictures from behind-the-scenes before him seeing it for the first time. We were hooked! Me again and him for the first time. It's a great 'bible' for any fan of the show. However, I wish they had all of the songs lyrics in the book, I would have loved that. But it's great otherwise.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Love it!  There are no other words...  Watch all the seasons.  You will not regret it!  One of the best shows I have seen!
B0024FADDI|5.0|It's been about a year since I bought it and now the movie is on sale for 5$, what a steal! I think I might've gotten it for the $15 but it's a great edition with loads of extras. I'm a big Evil Dead fan so this was a must-have regardless.
0060191325|4.0|Purchased book due to prior knowledge. It was as I anticipated. Gray makes valid points using a bit of a &#34;gimmicky&#34; analogy.
B003TH2G4Y|5.0|Awesome it was a great show. Wished it did not end with season two.  I really really really loved it
034580404X|5.0|I love the books, the case makes them mor easy to get them in and out.The gift box was a nice touch..
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I choose this rating because the music just fit what is going on in my life right now.  It is as if he wrote most of the music/lyrics just for me.I have always liked Joe's style of music and this CD is on the money.  I would recommed this to all who like love ballards and have some drama going on in their life.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the creative writing and story lines! Can't get enough of the show so I bought all the other seasons too! You can't go wrong with purchasing this series of shows. The relationship between the two brothers is both heartwarming and funny. How they tie in different folk legends and myths and mythology is fascinating. Always fresh and keeps you entertained and wanting more!
B0000057C5|3.0|Sehnsucht is perhaps the best known Rammstein album containing their international hit \\"Du Hast\\" (You Have) and their controversial song Bueck Dich (Bend Over) which landed a few band members in jail over its live performance. Sehnsucht is a fast tempo, hard hitting Teutonic metal album.However, I feel Sehnsucht is the weakest album released by Rammstein. Sehnsucht offers the least musical variety and the heavy, dense sound gets a bit monotonous and hard to listen too after the first few songs. Rammstein's complex melodies and artistic lyrics found in the successor album Mutter have yet to fully develop, though \\"Klavier\\" and \\"Alter Mann\\" show glimpses.<br /><br />The highlights for me are the following four tracks:<br /><br />Sehnsucht(Longing) - archetype of the album.<br />Du Hast(You Have) - simple, elegant and powerful track.<br />Eifersucht(Jealousy) - great melody produced with vocal syncopation.<br />Spiel Mit Mir (Play With Mir) - haunting and driving
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Who in their right mind would believe a Monster who's head lights up like the bubble on a police car?  Please tell me it is a joke.  If so, it would be a funny movie for the under 15 crowd.<br /><br />If it is actually supposed to be scary then:<br /><br />BE AFRAID!  BE VERY VERY AFRAID - OF SEEING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Good book and fast read.  There are many thought provoking ideas for a book talk and people can research some of the studies in the book.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I'm a huge NIN fan so this was a no brainer.  Trent Reznor has really taken his music back towards his original direction with Pretty Hate Machine, but much more maturity.  Really really good.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a fun game that's not too terribly hard to figure out. The pictures you create are creative and make you want to complete just to figure out out.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|a paint by numbers action/sci fi film. a bit heavy on the lens flare. good enough to rent but not sure there is a lot of rewatch value.
1623360277|5.0|Clear your mind of all the nutritional hype and clutter - Dr. John McDougall clearly explains the essence of macronutrients and why humans depend on whole food, complex carbohydrates first and foremost. If you are trying to get healthy or loose weight you must read this book - high protein, low carb diets or diets based on processed foods and powders are not sustainable and you will put the weight back on.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awsome i rekomend it but the big bad shark just 5 coins less.Im glad this is free so please bye it
0143124544|5.0|This book came so quickly and in perfect condition. I read it within a few days it was an excellent book I highly recommend.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|TheGreat and Powerful  movie was well done in special efx and sennery I thought that the story it self needed more plot to keep viewer.In the Wizard of OZ as simple it was made but far ahead of it s time the viewer at the end of movie felt a part of OZ or the cheracter I did not get that feeling with Great and Powerful, I felt like I was just watching what was going on not being part of. Although the Great and Powerful was worth watching I enjoyed meeting new chearcters of OZ and seeing the rest of Frank Baums world of OZ.
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|Ordered this for my daughter and she loves it!!Also the price was excellent.I would recommend this to a friend......Thanks!Thanks!<br />You!
B005NMBZJU|5.0|This is a wonderful mix of sting's hits and I especially like that some of them are songs from live concerts.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. One of the best horse games out there. I do get aggravated sometimes because it takes awhile to train. It doesn't freeze, you just have to wait until the horse gets to the jump.
0439023521|5.0|The book was for my daughter and she loved it!  She said it was way better than the movie and gave more detail.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Like the option the app provides for choosing either music or alarm signal. Also like the option for using a 24 hour clock.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is a very good CD and I'm happy I purchased it.  I remember hearing these songs as played by my Parents and Grandparents so long ago.  The stars chosen compliment Mr. Bennett's voice amazingly!  Amazon offers such good deals, that's why I always come here!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A fitting end to the series,the story is a dark one to begin with. Not exactly a \\"happy\\" ending but it flows well with the way the series is as a whole.
B00006GFAB|5.0|This is a super CD and I love listening to it.  Amazon always offers such good deals, that's why I always come here!
B003O86MY8|5.0|I absolutely love listening to his interpreted songs. It is great music to listen to at work while having to do paperwork. It helps me stay focused and not mentally drift. I will definitely be buying more of his music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works well with the phone specially for streaming youtube content to your TV in HD. Netflix also works well. Depending how fast is your connection and how new is the phone it will behave faster or slower. I  have the Motorola Razr Max and so far, so good.<br />For the price is a great deal.
B004UFEJS0|4.0|This movie is fun to watch over and over. My toddler loved the scenes that were in &#34;rat vision&#34;. It was nice to have both discs.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is one of my favorites! I didn't get to see her when she toured, this DVD makes me feel like I did! It is in perfect condition and I Absolutely love it as well as the included CD. Fan for life:-)
B008Y212PI|4.0|Perty good. The levels are fun and whatnot. And yeah, good God, the higher levels are hard as s***. Good luck!
1444737112|5.0|Anyone who loves cats and wants to support a recovered addict should buy this book. I give James Bowen major kudos for saving himself and Bob. The service from this bookseller was a 10!
B00DW0TFP6|5.0|Fantastic lyrical balance with riveting drum and guitar work. One of the bands best ever releases. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|I am new to these circle edge paper punches. I am sure I will love them as much as my other Martha Stewart dies. I was a little surprised how large the &#34;smallest&#34; punch is, but will still enjoy them.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A quick read and very informative. I have volunteered in a federal prison for more than 12 years, so I was interested in the subject to begin with. I liked that Kerman addresses justice issues, something that hasn't been brought to light in the Netflix series (I haven't watched all episodes yet, however). The book is entertaining while remaining very matter-of-fact about the day-to-day routines of doing time in a women's prison.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful place to go too. The characters are great. Love the whole storyline. The place they filmed it was gorgeous.
B006LSZECO|3.0|At first I didn't like the characters and I almost put the book down .. I didn't like Amy. Then I didn't like Nick. Then I was very afraid of AMY!<br /><br />The book was good, but I wanted a different ending. I wanted Amy to slip up and I wanted Nick to be rid of her. Honesty, I wanted Amy's life to be over in the same way that she ruined other peoples lives. That wasn't the ending and so I just feel completely dissatisfied, which is why I gave the book 3 stars.<br /><br />M.
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a wondefully detailed account of what happened many years ago to an unsuspecting negro woman when she went into Johns Hopkins Hospital for cancer treatment and the aftermath of her cells that the research team cultured and shipped all around the world. The impact of these cell cultures on her family is a great part of the story. It is a well thought out and very well organized story and worth reading to see just how far we have come medicallly since the 50's.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Having not read much from the German point-of-view, I found the book to be informative.  It was also great reading.
0374533555|5.0|This book would be great if it were only a compilation for the general public of a career of thinking about our psychological foibles, specifically the tendencies toward certain mistakes (or biases) that inhabit our judgment, by an absolute titan of the subject, as if capping off his long career with a summary of what he had learned (though to think of the quality of careers in how they end is itself a most terrible bias). Instead, what makes this book truly marvelous is that it is conceived of as a fiction: in order for us to understand the deeply alien way that the parts of us that we can't observe work, he instead tells of the tendencies of System 1 and System 2, two characters that describe components of ourselves as shorthand. This shorthand is deliberately created to exploit the tendency to see a world of agents, narrative, and pattern, even where they do not exist. He builds up a vocabulary for gossiping about these characters, as though around the coffee station at work, so that as we make decisions we imagine the criticisms of others about our own minds, which has been made necessary by our inescapable blindness to ourselves.<br /><br />My only criticism is that although he admits that these biases come from an astonishing ability to form and maintain worlds of astonishing complexity, he does not explain the tremendous capabilities that these biases trade for, the benefits we enjoy today in learning with nearly unjustified statistical rapidity. Yet, I feel that this is a challenge for coming generations of psychologists, and that this work stands testament to a scientific career as successful as any could hope for.

B00407PNWO|5.0|Love Old movie one of my favorites!!<br /><br />Always looked for this Movie was so glad I found it, So Happy.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I have never enjoyed a TV series as much as breaking bad. It becomes addictive! Each episode leaves you wanting more of it!
B005OK725M|4.0|I rated this movie 4 stars on Netflix when I first watched it.. So, I added it to my DVD Library.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I mostly purchased the chromecast out of curiosity since between my smart TV and WD HD box I can pretty much already do what the chromecast offers, and for $35 I had little reservations in doing so.  So after using it a bit I've found that this is the absolute best way to watch youtube videos on your HD TV.  Being able to search for videos on your phone and then &#34;cast&#34; them to the TV is far, far, far easier than trying to use a remote control to type in what your searching for and then scrolling through your options.  When I ordered this I couldn't imagine even using it for youtube videos but now that I have it I'm regularly finding myself browsing through videos and watching them in amazing quality on my TV.<br /><br />I am able to get to Netflix in three different ways now but I keep going to the chromecast for it.  This is mostly for the simple reason that it's just kind of more fun controlling it from my phone and I like the &#34;second screen&#34; experience that you get.  I've also found that I get the quickest navigation because again, searching is much easier, and because navigating their mobile site is super quick whereas the interfaces on my TV app and WD HD box can lag a little bit.<br /><br />That's about the long and short of it right now since the ability to cast from a tab on your chrome browser is still in beta.  It works fine enough if you just want to get a static webpage up on your TV screen, but there definitely is a bit of a lag, and if you try to play any video it isn't great quality and lags/skips.  Having said that though, that is an aspect that they're still working on and it could improve with updates.  I'm already extremely please with my chromecast but once they improve tab casting and adding more services (HBO Go!), this will reach the levels of greatness it is capable of.
081299471X|5.0|The theme, writing style and story complexity keep the reader continually engaged. I'm a slow reader by nature, but I burned through Cloud Atlas. I did see the film first, which I recommend.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! I Couldn't Put The Book Down! I Was At The Edge Of My Seat Throughout The Entire Book!
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|I have listened to Darius with Hootie and the Blow Fish in the past and now that he is doing country it is a joy to listen too.
0345529057|5.0|Impress your friends with your advanced knowledge of Westeros. Look cool on the bus/train. Start using the word &#34;whelp&#34; more often. So many reasons to buy! I enjoy the HBO show and love a good, long book, so this series has been a great read. For under $20, you can't go wrong.
B00AEFXQ9S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I hardly ever buy one but this is so exceptional and the premise is so different.
0399255370|5.0|Again this was a gift to my four year old great-nephew.  He has had everyone read it to him including me.  He just thinks it is hilarious!  It is a great concept and covers a lot of colors writing letters of praise and complaint to the owner of the box of crayons.  I read weekly to first graders and intend to use this as one of my books!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Using this app on nook tablet. Help please. Have many books in cloud and sent to this app. Screen delay is huge. Now it freezes yet again. Already rebooted nook a number of times. Thanks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  To me, that is the ultimate compliment when a friend recommends a book.  This is what I was told by several people, on separate occasions.  And it turned out to be the same for me.  I was intrigued from the beginning, and did not want the story to end.  Highly recommend if you love suspense.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|have enjoyed this cd. Liked that I could download the mp3 right away but why would the mp3 and cd together be cheaper then the mp3 or cd by themselves?
B009NH6JRE|3.0|I won't give too anything away, but the main story arc of the season got very tedious.  The Governor cheating death about four different times plus Andrea's blind stupidity regarding him made me long for the farm.  I hope they don't drag him out too long in season 4.  The only episode I truly enjoyed was &#34;Clear&#34;.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|This is an entertaining adaptation of the Fitzgerald book.  Acting and scripting good, stayed true to the original work. Would recommend.
B00DYVUBYM|2.0|Sophia Coppola's film is based on the true story of some jaded, amoral LA teens who stole millions of dollars worth of designer goods from celebrities they admired. They get high, take a lot of selfies, burglarize celeb homes and then do it all again and again.  Their complete lack of remorse is disgusting and the story left me feeling very sad for our fame-obsessed society.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is made of mostly newcomers and they are all convincing in fairly undemanding roles.  The story is shocking but somehow manages to be predictable and boring at times.  All in all, it's interesting but off-putting; not great cinema by any means.
1451626096|5.0|Philippa never disappoints and The White Princess is just as impressive as her other works!!! Buy this today, you won't regret it
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Another addition to my library.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very mind boggling but very addictive. Loved it.<br />Make sure you give yourself plenty of time. Shame it only had ten levels. I Want more!! Makes you really use your brain. Can bring many of you together as you all try to resolve the problem and it doesn't matter what age you are.<br />Just brilliant...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing his game. It seems a little more challenging than Spider Solitaire. I can easily lose track of time when playing this game.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love it!! Laugh all the time!! Makes a bad day so much better. Love the show!! Best show so far!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Amazon customer service was great with replacing my charger when my Kindle Fire would not charge, but that was not the problem.  The problem was a loose port, which I believe they know is an issue.  Customer service insisted it was the charger and not the port.  But it is the port.  The charger is great - so no complaints on the charger.  Would prefer a repair service for Kindle Fire instead of discounts for a replacement when the warranty is expired.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just a great extension of my kindles.  Great program that combines functionality with ease.  It means I do not have to carry my kindle with me to Chesterton Society meetings.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is a great ending to a great comic book movie trilogy. Buy it on Blue-ray!!! 5 stars
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If u read the book as I did a little each day you may get lost as it jumps back and forth in time and people. If the book had a family tree to a reference it would be clearer.
1439152810|5.0|Loved this book.  Kept me interested from the beginning.  Not heavy, light read but kept you wanting more until you finished and then you are bummed its over!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I have read all of the books written by Malcolm Gladwell.  I love his unique ideas and his examples explained by entertaining stories.  He is an easy, fast read.  He wrote Outliers, Blink, Tipping Point, What the Dog Saw, and many articles in The New Yorker.  He takes something obvious like a Bible Story of a shepherd boy going up against a armed giant to show that the boy had the advantage.  At first you think \\"How can that be?\\"  Then you read Malcolm's story and you say \\"Of course David had the advantage of speed in traveling without armor and more accuracy of his weapon at a greater distance and his better, youthful eyesight.\\"  Malcolm may or may not be right, but he makes you think.  Malcolm is very, very intelligent.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was the kind of book that I did not want to end.  I really enjoyed how all of the character's stories intertwined with one another,  I would recommend it highly!!!! I even liked the way the author ended the story.  I was not disappointed.
030746363X|5.0|This is a great book.  I bought the kindle version back when it first came out and lost 15 pounds of fat.  Not total, just fat.  Some friends of mine noticed and have been asking me about the book ever since I told them about it.  After a year of them asking questions I finally decided to get them the hard copy so they can try it out.<br /><br />Note: Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a lifestyle change that you can make one step at a time, and have some fun while doing it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Love the sound of these and the fit.  They are very comfortable.  I own several pairs of pro headphones but wanted these just for personal listing. I usually have pretty good luck with Sony.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  The writing is superb and each character is fully developed and unique.  And the twists keep me on the edge of the seat.  If there is one complaint it would be the &#34;love&#34; story between Alicia and Will...is it getting old? I guess I'll have to see what's in store in Season 5.
B004SIP9B0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  I thought Helen M. did a great job and all the actors were good in their parts except for Queen Mother.  I remember her so well and this lady just didn't even remind me of her.  I guess it was hard to fins someone to fit the part
B00CP4RZIO|4.0|Hard hitting album, with great songs such as All That's Left is Blood and Crown of Phantoms. Fans of hard hitting HEAVY metal will love this as will fans of Chimaira's old albums.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I remembered how handsome Robert Redford was in this movie, but had forgotten how classically beautiful Mia Farrow was as a young actress. The more recent version with Leonardo DiCaprio shows the more powerful side of Gatsby. The entire movie is more manic and powerful. This original from 1974 shows a kinder, gentler, Gatsby. The times are still wild and crazy but retain an innocence of the unknown future. I can't help but believe that the costuming played a big part in the overall ambiance of the film.<br /><br />The story of Gatsby was one of  unfailing love and uncaring betrayal and nothing plays like the original.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Don't know how I got this. Not a game but instructions I guess. Not loving it. I will look next time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This series shows how the death of one young boy winds up unearthing the secrets of a whole community. Only the detective brought in &#34;from away&#34; can see things objectively. The subplots are many the characters are multi-layered. The variety of accents and colloquialisms are sometimes hard to catch at first hearing, but David Tennant is brilliant and the supporting cast is strong.<br /><br />Excellent!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am rarely moved to outward expression of emotion when I read.  I enjoy the words but never am moved to tears because some character name on a page died in the story world.  I don't get angry when a protagonist experiences some horrifying injustice.  I regularly laugh hysterically in my head but rarely out loud.  This book invoked no tears or anger but it DID make me explode on occasion with a quick &#34;ha!&#34; at how hilariously Tina Fey recounts her life and experiences.  Easy to relate to but with written the affect of an SNL sketch writer...well duh...yet with enough feminism included to make any respectable woman (the kind I prefer to respect, at least) furrow her brow and nod in fervent agreement (which I did in my head, of course).
B007HJ8C6G|5.0|Sure, Mickey Roarke's character is a controlling masochist, but good sex is hard to find, and they had really good sex. Kim Basinger left that relationship with a wider awareness of herself and of men in general.  Not the love match of a lifetime, but an example of the extreme.<br /><br />Loved it!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you like tongue and cheek humor, blood flying everywhere, explosions, bullets, martial arts all presented by Sly, Ahhhhnooold, Bruce, et. al. You will love this!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that sways me to admire the characters. Diffenbaugh's writing style is so eloquent and sincere, I felt such a connection for with her characters . Although I questioned Victoria's choices, I still had this remorse, this sense that her character deserved so much.<br /><br />I loved how Diffenbaugh split current with past & how the whole plot just unfolded little by little. Page after page, I was eager to find out more about little Victoria & then her current coming of age.<br /><br />The ending was predictable, but again because of my admiration of the characters and their hand in her life, I was quite satisfied with the end.
B005OK721G|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Zoe is one great actress. She was great in the new Star Trek as well.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|recording and sound great. Watch it over and over and over. I  Would love to have it in blue ray.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|If only our American drama shows were half as good as the British ones- I would be content.  Broadchurch is one of the best shows EVER! If you didn't get to see it, do it- you will not be disappointed!  Up until the very end, you are suspecting everyone and for good reason too.  And even after revealing the killer, it continues to give you a great storyline & incredible acting!  Like when finishing a great book, one is sad to see it end....
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Very well produced and presented.  As good or better than all the other Avengers and definitely on par with the Best from Marvel.
044651506X|5.0|Started reading DeMille's earlier books.<br />Plum Island is not only great but it is informative.<br />Never knew this facility existed.<br />Hope Trump buys it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The show is great. We get to see interesting law cases and the characters are vivid, like-able and believable. We love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've really enjoyed this thing.  It really does work well.  We just need more web sites to get on board so that ehier content can be streamed.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The show is great. We get to see interesting law cases and the characters are vivid, like-able and believable. We love it.
9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter's photography book CHINA: Portrait of a People (second printing 2013, Blacksmith Books) is a remarkable photo-essay of China today, broad in scope and comprehensive of subject. Even when contrasted with the work of his predecessors, discussed below, there is something more about this book: a remarkable depth of insight, understanding, and feeling that Carter (1973-), an indigent wanderer from San Francisco, acquired for a people whose language he knew only slightly at the time he took the photos. Anyone able to overcome barriers to communication without knowing the language is an extraordinary person.<br /><br />Of the 100+ reviews on Amazon already posted, many readers regard Carter's Portrait as a surprising view into a \\"rapidly disappearing\\" China as the country dynamically thrusts forward into the new millennia. However, as the photos of John Thompson, Felice Beato, and other photographers of the 19th century are my point of departure, their work compared to Portrait illustrates substantially greater changes in China than any since 1949. Memory of more recent changes seems concentrated in metropolitan areas and along the coastlands rather than in the hinterland traipsed by Carter; perhaps such changes appear weighty because of a foreshortened time scale and accelerated development.<br /><br />It is unusual for a book to be a revelation for such a broad spectrum of readers as CHINA, Portrait of a People has been: besides travelers who have never been to China, and expat residents proud of their knowledge of the country yet unfamiliar with the greater landscape, the book has revealed to native Chinese much of their own country they knew little about. The book expands boundaries, reveals \\"undiscovered countries,\\" and is likely to rouse from their indifference to China almost anyone who looks through these photos.<br /><br />Carter's Portrait shows that \\"China is not just one place, one people, but 33 distinct regions populated by 56 different ethnicities, each with their own languages, customs and lifestyles.\\" We are told that the author backpacked 56,000 miles and visited over 200 cities and villages to gather material for this book, suffering privation, discomfort, and disease to complete this essay. The final result obviously made every step of his journey worthwhile.<br /><br />This review is continued at the Old China Books book blog - blog.oldchinabooks.com<br /><br />[[ASIN:9889979942 CHINA: Portrait of a People]], each with their own languages, customs and lifestyles.\\" We are told that the author backpacked 56,000 miles and visited over 200 cities and villages to gather material for this book, suffering privation, discomfort, and disease to complete this essay.

B0064MGU98|5.0|LOVE this show!! I am on my second viewing of GW. Highly recommend! I will be sad when I'm though them all.
B00FA5MU58|4.0|Big metsllics fan thought sound quality could b better great verity!waiting to go see the movie with great hopes!m head!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The movie was well made with lots of action. Story line was taken from Star Trek II with a twist. They could have done better I think. Otherwise the movie was entertaining.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use Yahoo daily.  It is my favorite site for checking mail and getting my news updates. The main thing I don't care for is having to watch an ad before I get to the story.
1476751935|5.0|I love to read it first thing in the morning! It gets me inspired to live the day ahead at my best and it gives me wisdom to face whatever comes my way.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love to play solitaire and it is great to have it loaded on my kindle.<br />This will come in handy when we start to travel again.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very interesting the way the story unfolds - the twister smack in the middle ( actually couple of twisters)<br /><br />The ending I have mixed feelings about but it wasn't what I expected<br /><br />A good gripping read about a marriage gone wrong nd it's consequences
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like to play bubble games, it seems to relax me and not a lot of thinking.  But it can be frustrating too.  I like to play games and these will keep me occupied.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book, I rate as five stars but an extra star should be granted for honesty.  Stephen K. has taken The Shining, from, as he states, a story written by an Alcoholic, to a sequel written by a sober member of the Fellowship, who breaks his anominity with the Dan Torrence character.<br />His storytelling is back in form and this sequel with the right actor playing, Sareys executioner, could make him the \\"Here's Johnny\\" of the 21st Century, with \\"Give us a kiss,dear.\\"<br /><br />At this point in the book Shephen K. gives us the Psycho scene and all scary scenes that the imagination can create,in 5 words that rock.<br /><br />This book is worth reading because it is Stephen K. at his best and the promise in the Big Book, Don't close the door on your past etc. is dominate in this reading.  AA quote, \\"Don't go into your own head without a gun and a flashlight\\", seems appropiate to Dr. Sleep.<br />By associating with Dan Torrence, we understand what life can do to a person and how alcohol can temporarily relieve our torments but eventually we must face the demons head on<br /><br />The ending is a typical reponse to an alcoholic's revelation of to the grave secrets, There is nothing you can share that hasn't already been shared, before you entered the Fellowship.<br /><br />Thank you Stephen K., please keeping writing as I am a original SK guru.
B00B4RP0OO|3.0|Nice player, doesnt freeze like other media players Ive tried on my kindle Fire HD. But it downloads album art which comes no where near the actual videos I have. It needs to have the ability to turn this feature off or to use an image from the actual video itself. This ruins an other wise perfect app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter loves the game! I just can give her the iPad and go shopping without worrying about her. I love how the game amuses her. I haven't heard her laugh in a long time. Thank you for everything!!!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I really enjoy the simplicity of the maze runner series but this one was way to complex<br />I thoroughly enjoyed it
B00005BF9Z|5.0|Their influences run from Spain to Portugal, French , English, Jamaican and all mixed together is nothing short of a Masterpiece. Ive had the CD for more than a decade and it still sounds as fresh as the first time I heard it. The tracks take you through a pleasant journey through the musical influnces of each country and island. Highly recommend!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Was very entertaining Friday night on a rainy day.<br />Actors are very good and the script is clever.<br />Recommend  it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The beginning was a little confusing for me and it took me a while to get into it because I couldn't quite figure out what was going on. The remaining 95% of the book? I read in one (very long) night. Can't wait to read the rest!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Do a deer...<br /><br />Sound of Music was a well done family movie/musical set in Austria during World War II.  The &#34;von Trapp&#34; family lost their mother and now the father, a naval officer, is left raising his children alone.  In an effort to ensure their proper upbringing, he acquires a &#34;nun&#34; (Julie Andrews) from the nearby convent for assistance.  This is where the fun and family friendly lessons begin (read: lots of singing).  The famous &#34;Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Te&#34; song, &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodnight&#34; and many others.<br /><br />But enough about the movie - as you can likely read a much better review of that on another website dedicated to the movie...this gift box has everything you could ever want for this wonderful, classic film.  An excellent quality DVD/Blu-Ray (no, they didn't do the impossible and enhance it to current standards) for the quality of the original cut.  I'd say the certainly cleaned it up enough to avoid any excess noise normally seen on VHS and other old standards.  The box itself is well-made and capable of holding all the goodies you'll receive with this set.  And in the end...you'll have the opportunity to show this film to the next generation of children...keeping the Sound of Music alive.<br /><br />Overall - if you enjoyed the movie and believe it would be a great gift to give someone (or your own collection) then I highly recommend getting this gift set.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like the game and give it 4 stars only because it is frustrating at times when I get stuck at one level. It's a good past time game when waiting for something else to get done. Teenagers might enjoy figuring out the strategy of the game and to see how fast they can make through all the levels.
B003F48E4W|5.0|For it's time, it was one of the best updated vampire movies of all-time,  and this was before the advent of computer-generated imagery, too!  I have seen it several times, and already have it on a regular DVD, but I just had to have it in Blu-ray!  It looks fabulous!  Buy this disc, folks!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is an interesting read about the reactions of a husband, wife, and mother when a terrible secret is reveiled.  I just felt the ending was a little unbelievable.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|i don't know how many times i was holding my breath and not knowing it! these zombies aren't quit like the ones in the old days:)
0879309210|5.0|This book is the &#34;go to&#34; source for any guitar player or repair person. The information is practical and useful from stringing your instrument and into deeper areas of set-up and repair. Dan Erlewine runs you through the basics and even goes into detail with specific guitars. whether you're into electric or acoustic it's the book to have.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Johnny and Helen singing?  yes, they are, and it was wonderful! compares well to Angela Lansbury's Broadway show.  Johnny Depp, Helen Bonham Carter, AND Alan Rickman - what a trifecta!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Was given as a Christmas gift to son-in-law who loves  Sci-Fi. I watch the regular DVD copy and was surprised at<br />the quality of the story. It makes you think of the probability of life.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Been awhile since i've seen this movie.  enjoyed the characters and story.  best part  is good guys win!  besides Tim Allen  AND Alan Rickman?  what could be better!

B0090SI4OC|5.0|I never read the book by Stephanie Myers but my wife did and I bought this movie for her at this great price
B002XXUWMI|5.0|Everything but the cliche ending were great. Some of these screenwriters need to find more inventive ways to end a movie.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Great Zombie Movie for those action lovers well put together,and at a great price. Thanks again, I'm Abigail SyFY fan
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|He did it again folks, made a masterpiece. You can hear him play the piano like never before, it's such a stripped down album. His voice sounding solid and full of emotion. The lyrics by Taupin, as always amazing. Loved this album, hope to see him when he comes to Minneapolis this November.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I'm a big fan of Star Trek and this one is well worth purchasing ,so I went for this deal and at a great price thanks
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product fast shipping The show takes place in Los Angeles, California, where Ray Donovan (Liev Schreiber), who is originally from South Boston, is a &#34;fixer&#34; for the powerful law firm Goldman & Drexler that represents the rich and famous. Ray experiences his own problems when his father, Mickey Donovan (Jon Voight), is unexpectedly released from prison and FBI agents try to bring down Ray and his associates.
B009JZSC9S|3.0|It gets a little predictable and the situations keep getting contrived.  There were a couple of episodes that were very interesting, but the rest of them make you wonder if the writers have ever been around real office politics.<br /><br />Despite all this, the season ends well.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|An incredible read, this book taught me more about racing and reminded me more about the important lessons of life than I can ever say. It's a perfect metaphor for handling life's difficulties and seeing things through. I loved the messages of kindness for those around us. I just can't say enough! And the fact that Enzo was a lab and terrier mix like my Indigo was icing on the cake. Get the tissues out for the ending!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My boys loves it and they plays it constantly. Whomever created this, share genius. Keep up the good work. Best.
0765309408|5.0|I will be 75 years old soon.  I wish this fiction was present now as I would sign up.  Well written story.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Before I saw this movie I heard a lot of people saying that it was mediocre at best. Add that with the fact that most of Zack Snyder's films are missing a good storyline with heart, I was very hesitant to see the film. I was very surprised however when I started watching how it just drew me in from beginning to end. Sure it wasn't top notch all the way through, there was still some cheesy moments, but overall it was a lot better than I thought it would be! I really enjoyed Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner as the parents, they did a great job! Personally I thought Amy Adams just didn't fit the role of Lois Lane, I thought they could have found someone better. I did like Laurence Fishburne as Perry, he played that role well. So if you're debating whether or not to watch the film, I'd say give it a shot! I think one of the reasons it turned out well was because Christopher Nolan was behind it, I'm sure he brought some great features to it! Hopefully the next one is even better!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun and addictive<br />I have to make myself self quit or I'm afraid I'll stay up all night playing!! Great mind builder

B008Y212PI|5.0|Surprisingly interesting logic puzzle game in the vein of Sudoku.  While there are a limited number of pictures, you can repeat at three different challenge levels.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Amazing if you love sushi,great images,is a nice documentary.<br />Es un increible documental si te gusta el sushi y la cultura japonesa
B0092MEGI4|5.0|I have to admit Steve Buscemi is brilliant! This show was a surprise to me of how good it is. HBO never disappoints But Boardwalk Empire is my now favorite show that I am know trying to catch up on. I have to admit that everyone should watch.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This is a must have movie to add to your Walt Disney Collection.  Story, grahics and animation are all outstanding.  If ypou don't buy this then you are missing out on a great movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome series. I finished all three books in about a week. Can't wait till the movie comes out. Wonder if it will be just Ike the books?
B00CL0J99K|5.0|In my opinion I think this is one of the BEST Iron Man movies that has come out yet.  Storyline, graphics, acting , action shoots are all Outstanding.  The ending is nothing that I was expecting and really makes you wonder what will happen next.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a great game for stimulating the brain!  Makes you really think what your next move should be.  AWESOME!
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Great CD , Avenged Sevenfold as always,  delivers another awesome album. If you like the others, you'll love this one too!
B00005RGI0|5.0|Amazing thankyou so much my partner loved it thanks again I searched  for months to find it thanks again *
0451417704|4.0|I heard about Daniel Suarez from an interview he did with Adam Curry that played on No Agenda (The Best Podcast in the Universe!) and became immediately interested in reading this book. I liked it so much that I then read Daemon and Freedom, which really blew me away. I'm glad I read the books in that order, otherwise Kill Decision might have been a bit of a letdown. Don't get me wrong, it's a truly excellent book, but Daemon/Freedom are on another level.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best ever TV show about Law. And their &#34;suits&#34; are good reference for business man as well. I just hope Harvey can win more in season 3.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I loved the movie in then and now I am sharing it with my daughter. Great movie in the 80's and today.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Great movie, was in great condition. 5 stars all around, was delivered on time. Glad to have a great classic like this in my collection
B00DU74U74|3.0|i did not watch this i don't remember renting it i did not see it in the cloud are u sure
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|When I saw the toy, I realized that it has more stuff that the picture shows (like a reproduction of his bag with money inside and the blue meth). It was fun.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|Great first album.  Synth pop at it best in 2012/2013. Can't for the next one album, which hopefully won't take 3 years to come out.
B000002H38|5.0|So happy to have found this CD, I love listening to my old jams.  This is one artist Love listening to, happy I found it.<br /><br />l
1423136802|5.0|Bought for our son. Great series to read even if they have seen the first two movies. He actually started the series after watching the movies and loves it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book does what it says it does i.e. proves that your thought create your reality.  It is fun to read and I bought one for my sister also.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A great time waster. Not hard to play. Great for a 3 AM something to do. I recommend it!!! Have fun with even the little ones in the family.
0525478817|5.0|She had been wanting to read this for a while, and then decided to use a birthday gift card to get it. She recommended it so highly, I think I'm going to read it next.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Wanted to smack Rebecca in the head!!! It's hard to find humor in such a shallow immature character. Very disturbing. I don't doubt that there are people like her in the world.
B00DGGIXS6|2.0|After reading all the reviews on here about auto  tune on the vocals(I would assume you people will not be seeing her live then as she lip synchies right ?? )<br /> . I'm alittle baffled . If you mean the electronic sound effects on her voice . I think she went with the sound because of the producers she worked with said \\" its the  in sound effect and everyone  is doing it \\" . Similar to the garbage w/ the robot sound effects that Madonna has put out as of late... I question the accusations here it is because her voice is too weak on its own  but being more about Cher not saying \\" Hey, i'm Cher and i'm not going to have my release sound like Lady Ga-ga or Pink with all the electronic voice crap . I'm doing this my way , with MY voice not having effects !!( remember the 70's bands that followed the trends of the 80's that the producers and labels told them they should do from the production of the music to the clothes and how bad that is looking back now ? )<br /> The real problem here is the songs. I was very excited to see that she was going to put out another release but, the upbeat songs are typical, boring, sound like everyone else ( except for the vocals ) and , have the same stupid club beat thru out that we started seeing on Living Proof with one minor difference. Those songs were good !<br /> The ballads are very boring and generic too.<br />Living Proof and especially Believe ( although they didn't have her biggest hits  ) were the best releases of her career  imo . Song after great song . And, great songs for her to perform to live .Too bad as all the people that work around her and Madonna all drink the Kool-Aid and are too afraid to say anything<br /> I know when she sings songs off this release in concert I will be going to the bathroom and getting another beer.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Great album by one of my favorite artists. Fans will not be disappointed! It is always good to support the artist by purchasing the physical album, even more so when its a two parter that allows you to build a house out of the cases!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Another great album by one of my favorite artists. Always support the artists by purchasing the physical album whenever possible!
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Love this movie.  Critics got in wrong.  I wish the story theme had been developed over several movies, maybe a few books.  This is the first movie I've ever purchased from Amazon, usually I just rent, but I couldn't wait to see this.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Great album by one of my favorite artists. Fans will not be disappointed! It is always good to support the artist by purchasing the physical album, even more so when its a two parter that allows you to build a house out of the cases!
0307730700|5.0|I was hooked on the book from page one. I will be reading it again. Absolutely an amazing book! Thank you for your sacrifice.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have spent many hours that I should have spent doing something more productive.  It is just addictive.  I am on my third run at it having zeroed out my first two.  It is fun  fun
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|Every one loved Patrick Whartburton but had no idea who he was until Seinfeld and the Emperor's New Groove. He speaks squirrel. Add John Goodman and the disgusting David Spade and you'll love every second of this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never lets me down. This book was one of the best. A must read for a Grisham fan
B002ZG98FU|4.0|and Harrison Ford is still awesome. Those two are enough of a reason to watch this movie. oh, and Diane Keaton is hot too.
B009EEGWOQ|5.0|I looked a long time for this classic to come out. I listened to this album when I was a teenager. Brings back many memories.
630529142X|4.0|Typical Adam Sandler movie. Ugly dude gets girl way out of his league and somehow makes you laugh the whole way through.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I loved kik until it wouldn't let me log on!! It's really frustrating because I&nbsp;text&nbsp;lot of people on here and  I loved this app
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Put these two people together and a nearly naked scene and you'll know exactly why I gave it 5 stars.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I enjoyed how the adapted it to today.  it was Descent and entertaining.  Check it out today if it is free.
1440503257|2.0|not new as was stated in the ad. the spine looked like it was shirnk wrapped. great book yet not great condition.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good read.  Keeps you guessing until the end. Well written. I have been a fan of John Grisham's for a long time. You won't be disappointed.
B000002C2E|4.0|renditions of reflective songs delivered in Dylan's aged<br />and timeless voice.  Had it on cassette and missed it so much. . . .
145162445X|5.0|It helped answer a lot of my questions. If you are wondering how something could come from nothing then this is the book for you.
B00466HM28|4.0|First of all, I really like this product, and my biggest issue isn't even really with the Akai itself, but with the software I'm using. The actual Akai itself though is actually pretty durable, and I don't have any quality control issues. My problem with the software is that on my laptop the standard audio driver produced about a half second of lag between me pressing the key or hitting the pad, and the software recognizing the sound. I fixed this by downloading a third party audio driver and everything works great! Best software choice for this thing is Ableton for sure, but Garage Band is a really good choice if you don't want to buy Ableton.<br />Altogether a really good choice in MIDI controller and I highly recommend it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved everything about this book--how fast-paced it was, the emotions it made me feel, and the sticky situation the wife is put into. The other characters are all great too, and I loved the Australian slang (the author is Australian). It just added another layer of interest for me. I'd highly recommend this book.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great fun and asy to use. I like that you can enlarge the puzzles for easy use on the iPhone.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Is a perfect size pool for toddlers. Sprays water and the slide is great.<br />Hope is good in storage for next summer
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Fluff and even the sex isn't great. However,  it is a fast read and distraction in this busy, stressful world.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Was not sure how to play this type of game.  But it did not take long to get it.  Tutorial excellent!!  I am so hooked on this game!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The worst of it all is to know that Johnson has given us a stunning and heart wrenching look at North Korea in its raw reality.  Difficut to read but well done.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|It's  so good.  send me another one, please  for a gift; Alot of behind  the scenes things were fascinating'.  I need another copy for a Christmas present.........
B006CBSE86|5.0|I've listened to all of their albums multiple times, and I have to say the three most recent are the most memorable (for me) in terms of their melodies. I highly recommend them. I especially like that the male singer and female singer both have parts, but the male singer isn't growling like cookie monster like in some similar bands.
B002KVCA1O|5.0|Great collection of their greatest hits. You can't go wrong with this rock & roll staple. Good party starter for those who like classic rock
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|As an old star trek fan I wasn't expecting to like the new remakes but the actors chosen are teriffic and it has been updated well for the new generation with all the exciting action and I even like the plots.  I look forward to continuing to go where no one has gone before!  I preordered this on DVD.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played. I love to text with emojis. That is how me and my friends text.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I love Bruce Willis and science fiction so I could hardly not love this movie!  Very imaginative plot!  Plenty of action!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I ordered this to watch so I could &#34;catch up&#34; before going to the theater to watch the second one that is out.  I'm glad I did because it gave me a much better understanding of the new movie.  I think it's a fun and entertaining series and I look forward to the third release.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I just love Ken Follett.  I can never put his books down and this is no exception.  His descriptive writing is so powerful that I could swear I know the characters in the book personally.  Filled with so many subplots but never confusing the book is completely riveting without a single boring moment.  Even though it follows on from another book it isn't necessary to have read the first but it does make it interesting.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Funny and &#34;cute&#34; enough to entertain the girls in the family and &#34;shoot-um-up, bang-bang&#34; enough to keep the guys interested.
B005LAII4E|3.0|It is what it is!  Family fun nonsense...  Sit down around the coffee table in the family room with tour pizza and/or wings and just watch the show.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I read the book and this brought the whole story to life.  All of the characters followed the original story line.
B000SEI230|5.0|Love it😍😍 it was an incredibable experience to read such a great book. Would reccommnto ages of all kids yes!!
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|Once again Yo La Tengo put out a rich oral tapestry of a record.  I also love to see them live
B005UG542S|5.0|It was the last of the HP series, have every one, needed this last part and it works beautifully. Something we have as a family from when it first came out and going with my first child, to this last one, that all our children now seen together.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Excellent album! I loved hearing the older tunes I was familiar with plus the ones I have never heard.  The fidelity is excellent
B00F87A7HG|5.0|Love it! All that I expected and more! I don't think I would say it's their best, but I love it!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Great show...I like to wait until the season is over and watch the season.  Can't hardly wait for season 5.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle so my son could use it in class.  He loved it so I love it!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|A must see if you like Bradley Cooper.  He was amazing in this film.  Great acting.  Jennifer Lawrence plays this part so well!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Love the writing and the action sequences. Hate the costumes. I'll watch this a bunch more times.  Definitely worth renting.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Must see!  Great movie, acting & special effects.  Blu-Ray rocks with picture & surround sound.<br />This is a great movie about family and love.
B001TH16DI|5.0|It was a smooth process.  I've played one movie and it was fine,so I expect the rest to be the same.
B0011Z32KI|5.0|Michael is the man....love his music.  Great selection of songs.<br />Every album makes me smile and makes my drive to and from work<br />so much more fun!
630471193X|5.0|I had been looking for this everywhere. It is an older movie now. My husband really wanted to see it again so we got it. It was in perfect condition and played perfectly. It was shipped very securely and quickly as well.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzil Washington plays this part with so much authority!  The special effects are so realistic.  You almost feel like you are in the plane with all those passengers.  Deep story.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Can't say enough great things about this little book. It's filled with wonderful eye opening experiments that can really touch you, if you let them. And I found her sense of humor delightful!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter can't watch this video enough.  She has to watch it everyday to go to sleep. Def worth buying
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Excellent film!<br />This feels like a good, strong finish to the Iron Man trilogy (though I'll still be wishing for more as long Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow coninute to star in them). It's full of plot twists and still some character development in this third film. A movie worth seeing at least once in your lifetime.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This is the first video I recorded off the tv but didn't get it from the start and my daughter woudl always ask me why so I bought it. SHe loves it and can watch it over and over again and still get scared when Tinker gets caught. LOL
B0041D843M|5.0|Even though this book has a lot of data and research material (which substantiates the book's premise), it is a good read to convince you that you should take a good hard look at your diet.<br /><br />I have been referring to it in conversations since I started reading it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this app. I got caught in this game as well for an appointment and it was entertainment as well.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This app is fun and frustrating. this is a great brain twister.Really make you think hard.My kids enjoy it too.
B000ZJW4NW|5.0|John is at his best in the show great acting by the hold cast not one moment was I board sad to see the show end just rember never buy used dvd some will frezze or have scratch es
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I was amazed when I saw the gift set was practically brand new, with the board game still sealed!<br /><br />I do recomend this seller.
B002DGOG9U|5.0|The Tudors season one to four makes a great gift for you or friends I enjoy the hold season from began to end not one moment of broded
B004LWZW42|5.0|Un excelente producto, muy bien empacado, acorde a las expectativas que tenia. Los men&uacute;s de facil acceso, me encanto, lo recomendaria ampliamente
B007WULJ5G|1.0|Ok. So I know that some European societies don't always share American taboo.  But this film should be considered disgusting by any red blooded American worth his/her citizenship. Way too many innuendos of child pornography and shocking scenes showing the act. Too much for me. Way too much. Some images are just not worth portraying because you can't take them back. This one crosses the line. Don't do it. Trust me.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a fun game.  Keeps you entertained. I really like it though I have only played the 5x5 board I :).
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I purchase this game for my 6 years old son,and until now he is very pleased.He is a big fan of this game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I just want to know the weather! This is good enough for me. It's FREE to. And if I want to know the weather for tomorrow it will give me that two. IT IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I purchase this game for my 6 years old son,and until now he is very pleased.He is a big fan of this game
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Willow is definitely a dated movie.  It was made in 1988 and directed by Ron Howard.  I, as many people am a real fan of Ron Howard's movies.  This one is a Fantasy and Action movie written by George Lucas.  I like it and thus purchased the Blu-Ray edition.  But because it is dated it may not appeal to everyone.  Its definitely not one of Ron's top movies and does spoof the sword and wizardry genre.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I am hooked too, kids love it and so do I, when the little creature does not get the food and he goes ohhh so cute.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|I have the DVD copy of Grosse Pointe Blank and enjoyed it so much that I had to purchase the BluRay edition.  John Cusack does a good job in his role of Martin Blank, a for hire assassin, and how he has personally struggled with his occupation.  Minnie Driver, is his jilted ex-girlfriend from his high school days.  He returns to his home town for his high school reunion and tries to re-engage his relationship with Driver.  This takes him back to a better time and has him questioning who and what he is.  This is an enjoyable action/romance movie that entertains and finishes with a twist.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Anyone who loves Arthurian history/lore will love this! It's a different angle than what one is used to, but really is quite believable, as 6th century Britain was filled with sorcery & territorial wars.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I have been a fan of Amy Adams every since I saw her in the Disney movie, Enchanted.  In this fast paced and entertaining movie Amy Adams and Frances McDormand keep you involved with Amy's character, a night club singer out to promote her career, but at the same time the overall more worldly change to McDormand's character.  The movie has wit and charm set in the days prior to World War 2 in London.  Its very light hearted and twists.
0345803507|4.0|THIRD BOOK OF TRIOLGY WAS OK. NEED BOOK FOUR TO CONTINUE THE FANTASTIC ROMANCE THEY HAD BEFORE CHILDREN CAME. JUST BECAUSE KIDS ARRIVED DONT MEAN THEY CAN NOT BE WHO THEY WERE IN BOOK ONE. OVERALL I ENJOYED THE TRILOGY. CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK E L JAMES
B00867HDTA|4.0|I've played a few of the Flick games before (Golf, Golf 2, Football). All of them pretty much have the same basic premise: flick the ball towards the target and guide the ball in flight.<br /><br />The graphics are very good, and the game is responsive. It can get repetitive, but it is still fun. It's a good fill-in for when you have a few minutes to spare.
0345803493|5.0|EXCELLENT CONTNUATION FROM FIRST BOOK DIDN'T SKIP A BEAT. HAD TO HURRY UP TO READ THIRD BOOK. E.L. JAMES IS THE BOMB
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon knows how to tell a story.  The first two books were page turners and this one hooked me on the first page.  It's hard to put down..
0307887960|1.0|This is the diet for you!!!  I was sick, sluggish, irritable, and dizzy, not to mention that I felt like I would probably be hospitalized if I continued. This was after 5 days of the diet, even though I was supposed to feel euphoric and have more energy 3 days in.  You're better off losing weight the old fashioned way: balance, portion control, and regular exercise.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter loves this movie!! At first I wasn't too sure about it, but it ends nicely. It is now her favorite movie!
B001NLL93W|4.0|I liked the series and read all of the books.  Good reading for young adults. Will see the movie. Enjoy.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|It works, but does not improve my mother's ability to hear and make out the voices on the television. Will be returning this item.
B006LSZECO|5.0|good read. keeps you involved and you can't wait to see what happens next. loved the ending. well worth the money.
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|This movie okay. Older than I thought it was. Children liked it. ............................... We will most likely sell this one again.
1476727651|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves everything Stephen King writes and has all of his books.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Children liked this movie alot. I did not much care for it myself. Seemed pretty ridiculous with all the weird characters and singing.
B000002KET|5.0|Got it like 2 days before I was scheduled to arrive, brand new. No cracks in the case or anything!
B00464CU7M|2.0|Too much schmaltz for me....lots of costumes and fal-de -ral!!  She looks like a Barbie doll and can hardly stand to watch the screen.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Got it like 2 days before I was scheduled to arrive, brand new. No cracks in the case or anything!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works well ... like having prior calculations available on screen ... price is certainly right ... wish that it had square root and trig functions
B000002KFJ|5.0|Got it like 2 days before I was scheduled to arrive, brand new. No cracks in the case or anything!
0152465073|5.0|Although this book is short, it has a really deep meaning in the story that is worth reading. Try it.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|enjoyable read, easy to put down and pick up. Nothing about it makes you need to go out and read anymore of the series. It was just OK
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Maybe the game was meant to be this way but I find the cars almost undriveable - any little steering results in wild course changes, with little to no hope of course recovery.  Maybe some like their car games this way.  Fun for two to three plays, then deleted it.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Mud provides an interesting depiction of a disappearing way of life.  Not sure if there is any accuracy, but interesting nonetheless.  The actor playing Ellis is great.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My 7 yr old son loves this. Periodically, he will pick it up and get a few more steps each time. We have not had any of the issues with quality that other reviews mention although we keep it on the stand on top of a book shelf. I had a hard time deciding between the regular and Epic versions. I'm glad I chose this. My son likes that it's called &#34;epic&#34; and that it's the most difficult one.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Henry VIII was never that fit and gorgeous, but a great introduction to that period of history.  What it lacks in historical fact it more than makes up for in the most beautiful sets I've ever seen in a TV series.  Actors, costumes, videography all top notch.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|At first, I wasn't the biggest fan of the single on this album, Suit and Tie, but in the context of the album I think it's great! The album starts off with a great song and doesn't stop sounding great. Occasionally I'll skip the last few minutes of a few tracks - they're all about 6 minutes - but if I\\"m running or exercising I love to listen to this album.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|The story line is predictable, but it's good enough. Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel are worth the price of admission - so attractive.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Easy to install. Works great!  Its a small amount of money for a huge return in quality time spent with my grandson.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I liked this movie. It's quirky, has a unique cast of characters, fairly representative of school kids, and I thought the acting was good.  I enjoyed it so gave it 4 stars.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Loved the entire series.  The evolution of Walter White from Mr. Chips to Scarface<br />is exciting and mesmerizing to watch.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|What's not to like?<br /><br />It's odd that I'd enjoy a series about a chem teacher selling meth. That aside, it's really well done. It's a compelling story, unpredictable, and the actors are incredible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow, 3rd season had many surprises that I was not expecting! Love the show, but the seasonal finale was heartbreaking!
B002ZG97M4|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie footloose and being able to get it as a bundle pack with blue-ray, DVD and a digital copy allows me to see it whenever and however I want. This is definitely a product I would recommend to all those who love the new version of footloose.
B008469DGY|4.0|I think I've summed up the game in the four words of my review.  It's not golf, and that's the one knock I can see people having, as anyone thinking they've ordered a golf game will be sorely disappointed.  That said, the mechanic of trying to flick an object into a goal (a reskinning of the classic paper into a wastebasket game) with the added twist of controlling the spin of the ball after the initial shot is a good idea, and the golf theme fits it well.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I have enjoyed every season of this show. It is exciting as we draw ever closer to meeting the Mother!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I picked this up not knowing what to expect.  What I got was Tennis In The Face.  Seriously, the title absolutely matches the art, which matches the tone and gameplay very well.  This is a silly, fun and challenging game that I found myself looking forward to playing in bed at night, right up until I'd beaten all the levels and gotten all the crowns.  If you remotely like &#34;hit targets with projectiles that bounce and/or explode&#34; games, pick this up, it is a very well made and very fun game.
B00914JWSW|5.0|After all the years she's been singing and making albums, I still look forward to hearing a new one - what a voice.
B008Y212PI|5.0|These kind of puzzles have been around in video games and magazines since before I first lived in Japan 1997.  While this isn't new or groundbreaking, it is fairly well executed and well suited for play on a tablet.  None of the puzzles are particularly challenging, so there's no need for a flag option, and this may be a let down for people looking for large and/or difficult puzzles.  However, as a game that I can pick up and play when I have a few moments to spare, it's an enjoyable time waster.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Great CD. Brad Pitt is so good in this film.  I received the CD in good time.  Grab a bag of popcorn and have a  good movie. Thanks
B009FXIICK|4.0|Zoo Keeper was the first game I owned for my Nintendo DS, as it was a launch game in Japan, where I was living when the DS was released.  It was such an early title that it wouldn't put the DS in sleep mode when you shut the lid, and the game would keep running with the screen on.  I played that game for several years and Time Attack became the mode that my family eventually obsessed over, slowly going from the hundreds of thousands of points to several million on our way to a DS with the horizontal and vertical lines from Zoo Keeper etched into the screen.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised with the lack of popularity of Zoo Keeper when I came back to the states.  The game was popular on phones in Japan before the iPhone ever took off, and the iPhone version was released before I moved back to the states.  It's a well designed game that puts a very heavy emphasis on intentional combos and reaction time, and I was very excited to see a Kindle version is available.<br /><br />The problem with Zoo Keeper is that it's not as well suited to an 8.9&#34; tablet and finger as it is to a Nintendo DS sized handheld with an accurate stylus that requires minimal, but precise, movements.  On the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;, I found that swipes would sometimes only select an animal or would even select an animal and then select the animal two spaces away instead of successfully swapping the animal with the adjacent animal.  When you know what you want to do and your finger moves where it should but the game doesn't respond as it should, it's very frustrating.<br /><br />The other thing I was disappointed by is the lack of game modes.  I have only made it to level 15 in my first hour or two with Zookeeper DX, so I don't know if it's possible to beat normal mode as it was in the DS version, or if Normal mode is essentially a hybrid of the original Time Attack and Zoo Keeper mode, but I would definitely preferred the two modes stay separate.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cute and simplistic art, the game is demanding, and has deeper gameplay than it initially appears to have.  It's your basic match-three, but the game is based upon combos, and you need to set off a second match before the first has completed to get the score multiplier and remaining time multipliers you'll need to progress far or put up high scores.  I have always preferred it to games like Bejeweled or Candy Crush Saga because there's a much higher correlation between the player's skill and their performance than in other match three games.<br /><br />When no moves are left, you will always get a time bump and a power-up that removes all of one animal.  It's very possible to get No Moves Left immediately upon a No Moves Left reshuffle (it doesn't count the power-up), which was true of the original as well, but the power-up is a good equalizer, and really rewards people who can quickly get to a No Moves reset, as the power-up provides a great way out.<br /><br />I'd love to say I'm going to continue to play this, but the limited number of game modes and the lack of highly accurate response to inputs mean that the game comes up short compared to superior 2004 DS game it's based on.  (Zoo Keeper actually came out for the Gameboy Advance before the Nintendo DS, but was much better suited for the touch input of the DS over the game pad and buttons of the GBA)

0887307280|5.0|For anyone trying to start a small business, this is a must read. We're now in a time when small business more then ever is going to define America & Americans. The size & scope of the Federal government has driven Americans back to their roots of having a good idea, bringing it off the drawing board , quickly & into the hands of the consumer like it was when De Toqueville made his second visit to America & remarked that American education was at a state where Americans, because of their approach to education could & did indeed have the speediest delivery to the customer of whatever it was they were producing by reason of the above mentioned quickness with which they simply thought it up & did it..<br /> We are back to that. America's always been the home of small business. Indeed when you look back at the last quarter century, most of the big names today were themselves small businesses started in garages, small offices & work shops. One example that jumps to mind is the .50 caliber rifle made one at a time over in Bardstown Ky. that hit the field in sample quantities with The U.S.M.C. in the Desert Shield phase of  our entry into the Wars of the Middle east. The fella who invented it made a weapon that could go through an APC & scare the hell out of the Iraqui to the point where they thought they were under missile attack.<br /> Point of departure though, Microsoft was there. Fed-X was there & Dozens of other big brands you can think of have begun there. Here & around the world so, we've no longer got any claim to being unique in this regard but what we still do possess is a marriage of liberty & opportunity added to a lingering suspicion that abiding by the law, no matter what anyone tells you so; get busy thinking it up & doing it!!!<br />Best regards,<br />Braxton Valentine<br />Richmond.Virginia.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|A poignant look at life before and during the great war, as experienced by an ordinary Jewish family who are focused as much on their personal issues as on the momentous events around them. Sebastian loses his leg when he is just a boy and this loss influences him not only physically but also emotionally. He strives to find his place in the world, to find a woman who will love him for himself and not out of pity. It is this story - supported by the finely drawn characters of his family - that plays out against the bigger political canvas of the war. Strong writing and clear storytelling make this novel forceful with a reality which is drawn with empathy but no 'over the top' emotion. I found the story deepened as the novel progressed and I was engrossed by the drama, the pathos - and ultimately the hope and strength of the human spirit in difficult circumstances. A well-crafted novel, an excellent read.

Other than that the chromecast device works great.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I've had these for about three week and have really enjoyed the benefit they add to my swimming.  I did find that without a swim cap they don't quite stay on as well (especially doing the breast stroke or butter fly) but once I started using one they stay on perfect.  Alot of the reviews I read said they broke pretty quickly so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that that won't happen.  I also feel like the volume level varies quite a bit for different songs on here.  sometimes I'll pull my head out of the water and it will actually be painful its so loud (even though udner water it sounds great).  Definitely would recommend as a buy, but I will comment again in a few months to inform you how they have held up.

1781162646|5.0|Definitely not what I'm used to from Stephen King but enjoyable, just the same.  I could relate to the events...the broken hearted young love, starting over in a new job and making new friends, wanting to see the ghost that everyone talks about but very few have ever seen, and solving the crime that no one has ever been able to solve.  Worth reading to the very end.

If you could change history, what would you change and what are the implications. King does a great job of exploring this and more. I couldn't hardly put it down as I read it.

1476727651|4.0|Doctor Sleep is the sequel to the book The Shining, by Stephen King and while it is not as good as The Stand, It, or Under The Dome it was still a better read than half of the books I have read this year. Doctor Sleep is about Dan Torrance who is all grown up, and like his father is an alcoholic, he is also an occasional worker in nursing homes. He goes from one city to the next drifting and drinking until he winds up in New Hampshire. It is in New Hampshire where Dan gets sober and is contacted by Abra a girl who has shining capabilities that are worlds stronger than than Dan's. the two need to work together to stop a group of vampire like people who in order to survive, must torture and kill children with shining capabilities. Stephen King as always does an excellent job of sucking the reader in from page one, and brings the story full circle back to the Overlook hotel from the first book, but  what was different for me was I was able to put this book down and do other things, usually with a King book I read the book straight through. Parts of the book are to descriptive of things that are not very important to the story. Also they is a bit too much description and process procedure of AA meetings and their philosophy, which I think is a great program but I did not need all of the particulars for this story to work.<br />The book is a Stephen King book all of the usual elements are in place, and while you may have disappointments with the book because you think it could have been better, chances are it is much better than a number of other books you have recently read.
B00B52F278|5.0|This last season of Spartacus is just as thrilling, just as beautiful, and just as jawdropping as its predecessors. As the season opens Spartacus has gathered thousands of rebellious slaves and is trying to find a way to feed them as winter sets in. In the meantime, Rome has commissioned its wealthiest citizen, Senator Crassus, to deal with the advancing army. Crassus is a more worthy opponent to the clever hero, and he has nearly as many tricks up his sleeve as Spartacus. In addition he's aided by a young and impetuous Julius Caesar, who sneaks in to the rebel camp and acts as a spy. Brilliant.<br /><br />All of the acting is sublime -- not a bad performance anywhere. Liam McIntyre manages to embody a man who kills for a living and a hobby, yet still seems the most humane person in the room. The sidekicks are still here (Gannacus, Agron, Crixus, etc.) and there is still plenty of skin, both in softcore sex scenes and gory battle sequences, with CGI adding depth and texture to these classic settings. There are pirates and battles, and love and hate, and gorgeous guys speaking Shakespeare-ese.<br /><br />I loved every minute of it. And to all the people who brought it to us, I say: Gratitude.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|A feast for your eyes a great movie good acting great soundtrack and the story is a timeless love story
1439170916|1.0|If you already know that America's conventional treatment of cancer is the best in the world, would like to know the detailed history of it, and that all other viewpoints on cancer are \\"quackery\\", this book is for you, click NOT helpful and move on to other reviews.  For as a book \\"strictly\\" focused on the detailed history of cancer treatments in relation to surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and gene therapy, this book is 5 stars.  It follows the history from bloodletting, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, to the proposed future of gene therapy in excellent, surprisingly honest, and perhaps interesting detail.<br /><br />BUT if you are trying to understand the BIG picture of cancer, it's cause, it's prevention, why the treatment of cancer is so brutal and unsuccessful, if there are other treatment options, please read on.  As \\"A Biography of Cancer\\" stated in the the title, it is misleading, incomplete, and ultimately I found it very FRUSTRATING to read.  There is very limited discussion on the cause and prevention of cancer which I would expect many readers are interested in.  The only discussion of the role of nutrition is to state that because it hasn't been tested, it cannot be part of the discussion.  Billions of dollars were shown to have been spent on the research and development of drugs to treat cancers since Nixon's \\"War on Cancer\\", yet there is nothing in this book showing any interest in looking at the obvious link between what we eat/drink and cancer.<br /><br />For those looking to understand the cause of cancer, how to prevent it from occurring in the first place, or how to heal it with non invasive treatments, there is NO information here of that.  For those who wonder how our society will afford more and more people getting cancer at $350,000 each, there is NO mention here of that.<br /><br />Several of the early successful treatments of cancer (Hoxsey, Rene Caisse, Gerson, Breuss) which cured hundreds/thousands of cancer cases are not mentioned.  There is not a mention of the many current successes of treatments outside of the AMA's protocol, that are currently found in the US and throughout the rest of the world.  There is not a word of how processed sugars can feed the growth and return of cancers which is \\"common knowledge\\" in the world of natural treatments.<br /><br />(There is a section called \\"Prevention is the Cure\\" which includes an honest in-depth discussion on how it took 30 years for the medical association to accept that blackened lungs caused by smoking could cause lung cancers but not much else other than testing for early detection as far as guidelines to prevent cancer.)<br /><br />The author presents that cause is not important, prevention is not possible, and that cancer can only be treated by the use of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and now gene therapy.  The author discusses that even though there have been only slight gains in survival rates since the beginning of Nixon's \\"War on Cancer\\", that they are still making gains albeit minimal and slowly, and the true gains are when patients can extend their life by months possibly even passing beyond the 5 year goal of surviving the disease and the treatment.  The author shows how the strategy of bringing the patients to the brink of death and hopefully back has developed and has been embraced by the medical community, hopefully leading to an extended period of remission before a secondary cancer is expected to return.  I found it difficult to read and understand how this strategy could be continually embraced when there are non-invasive strategies that are much less expensive, more humane, and more successful.<br /><br />It was an emotional book to read.  It was frustrating to read the story of how 500,000 women were given radical total mastectomies to remove everything the Doctors could think of before one Doctor proved a small removal would give the same success rate, and he was then laughed at for his \\"lumpectomies\\".  There were many stories that tore open ones heart of the many that suffered so much from cancer and the treatment.  Hearing about the survivors who were able to return to a normal life was a powerful part of the book.<br /><br />For a different viewpoint on the history of cancer, I offer the book and related video \\"When Healing Becomes a Crime\\".  Note the video is available on youtube.  Samuel Epstein's book \\"The Politics of Cancer\\" gives a very thorough understanding of the history behind the treatment of cancer.  Also look into the genius of Royal Rife who made tremendous discoveries into the cause of cancer, and potentially the cure of cancers, and with not a word mentioned about him in this book.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I had no knowledge of health or nutrition until 1997 when I read Bill Moyer's \\"Healing and the Mind\\" and took a graduate level Holistic Healing class, both of which changed my life and opened my mind to a new way of understanding.  My life since then has been dedicated to understanding health and nutrition through hundreds of books on cancer and nutrition, eating a plant based alkaline diet, AND a prescription drug free life.  Mike Anderson's book \\"Healing Cancer from the Inside Out\\" has perhaps the best general guidelines for understanding of cancer.  And my personal choice would be the Gerson Therapy as the base program for a cancer treatment in the case I were to ever be diagnosed with cancer.y stories that tore open ones heart of the many that suffered so much from cancer and the treatment.

I borrowed it for free from the lending library, broke my own rule and kept it for 2 months, and never got past 20%. So boring, so repetitive. I normally read like a maniac, perhaps a novel every 3 days; that should tell you how hard I had to work to get as far as I got. I'm glad I turned it back in and gave up on it--something I've never done.

B00EF1PKJQ|4.0|First of all, let me say that Sarah Jarosz has made it onto my list of \\"must have\\" artists. I own all three of her CD's, including this latest, \\"Build Me Up From Bones\\". My assessment of this latest effort is that it is very good and it fulfills almost everything you'd expect from Sarah. This is folksy Americana, sung with delicate heartfelt vocals, smooth musicianship and with genuine respect to the genre. I'll add that Sarah Jarosz no doubt has a unique approach to her music and it is truly refreshing in today's music world. The only problem I have with this one is that is seems to be missing those hauntingly gorgeous standout songs like \\"Shankill Butchers\\" or \\"My Muse\\", two songs from her previous CD's that are truly amazing. My favorite song on this is \\"Mile On the Moon\\" because it does evoke a mood and a feeling that transcends the music. This is what Sarah does best, those moments when her vocals overlay the music, but go off into exciting places. \\"Gone Too Soon\\" is another song I really like. The rest are all good, but don't seem to bring out that unique quality of her vocals. The Bob Dylan cover \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" was very average, unlike her treatment of \\"Ring Them Bells\\" on her Follow Me Down CD that was exceptionally good. My criticisms are minor. Purchase this CD and enjoy. Sarah Jarosz has talent and I think the best is yet to come.

This was not what I received but the Seller was very apologetic with regard to the obvious mistake in labeling or bar coding and allowed me to keep the video with a credit. I otherwise enjoyed the video and was able to understand certain things I missed when viewing in the past.

B00E9P959O|5.0|It is quite obvious that this remaster fixes the distortion and crackling present in the original.  I also think the mix was adjusted as I can now hear certain parts that I didn't before (hence the \\"remixed\\" in the title).  I am pretty sure new parts were added that weren't in the original release at all.  I heard bits of a guitar solo and some background vocals that I don't think were there before.  This made listening to this very familiar recording seem somewhat new again.  If you enjoyed the original and are a fan you should definitely pick this up.  Finally being able to hear it clearly and hear parts that were dropped from the original was worth the price.  I am a bit annoyed I have to pay twice to get the recording that should have been released in the first place but at least it is available.<br /><br />I don't understand how the original recording was released in the condition it was. When I first listened to it I thought one of my speaker drivers had a tear in the cone.  After I eliminated that I was sure my amplifier was going but I eliminated that as well.  Until I read the problems with the original master I though it must just have been a guitar effect Alex added.  I didn't think there was any way a band with this much experience in the music business could let a problem like this slip by.  They put so much effort into their recordings allowing all this distortion seemed impossible.  I first noticed it on secret touch and earthshine but on hearing the new master is it quite obvious that all the tracks suffered.  How could no one correct this before it went to press?  When I was 12 years old and making tapes I learned pretty quick if you let the input levels go too far in the red it will get distorted.  Why couldn't the original engineer figure this out?  Frankly he should be a little embarrassed for doing an excellent recording such a disservice.  I understand the pressure to make a \\"loud\\" album but ADDING distortion is inexcusable  I think a better approach would be to do what Nine Inch Nails did with their 2013 record.  If you bought it from their web site you could download either or both, a standard \\"loud\\" version or an audiophile version, at NO extra charge.  At least now artists are realizing that their audience can appreciate the difference.

0887307280|1.0|I'll admit up front that I never read this book, never attended the, apparently lifelong seminars. I didn't have to. I had the opportunity to live with the results of a business owner's choice in subscribing to this conman's abberant ideas.<br /><br />In 1994, my husband started working for a local electrical and HVAC contractor. The company was considered to be one of the best locally and had a reputation of dealing fairly with their employees. It was, in short, a prime job to have. During the time of my husband's employ they went from being a small business employing maybe a dozen people to the second largest in the area. They employed forty-five to fifty people and juggled government contracts while still supplying prompt and highly rated service to local homeowners.<br /><br />Then came 2005. The boss made a bad decision regarding a couple government jobs and wound up losing a lot of money. 2006, on someone's suggestion, he made another bad decision and subscribed to Gerber's E-Myth claptrap. His whole attitude began changing. The successful methods he'd employed to grow his business were cast aside in favor of Gerber's \\"expert\\" advice. Within six months five of his longtime electricians and HVAC technicians had quit.<br /><br />It was about this time that my husband and a fellow middle-manager caught wind of what was driving this new hard-liner attitude - aside from anger and frustration over losing his keester the year before. My husband called me one day and asked me to see what I could find about something called E-Myth and Michael Gerber.<br /><br />Something didn't smell right from the get go, and I decided to focus on one simple question. What were the author's credentials? The guy's a business guru, knows everything there is about running a successful business? Okay, fine. Where did he learn all this stuff? What kind of businesses had he started and successfully operated?<br /><br />I couldn't seem to find that out anywhere. All I found were proclamations of what an absolute wizard he was on running a small business. Countless \\"reviews\\" on what a boon his book and seminars were for people. Finally a phone number (buried way down deep somewhere) for contact. Said phone number connected me to the private residence of an Hispanic woman in California who never seemed to be home. Following most of the reviews brought me to people who thought this guy's ideas were so great they'd become distributors of the book themselves!<br /><br />Finally, after three weeks of searching, I found the answer to my original query. It was a transcript of the Q&A session during of one of Gerber's speaking engagements. A young man stood and asked the same question I had been. There was a noticeable amount of hemming and hawing on Gerber's part before his mystery credentials were revealed.<br /><br />He'd written and self-published a book called E-Myth, which he then marketed online.<br /><br />So, there you have it folks. The only \\"business\\" this Guru ever started - or operated - was writing and self-publishing a book about how to successfully start and run a business. Where did he get his acumen to do so? Undoubtedly from reading other people's books, since he had no hand's-on experience of his own. From where I stand (and I have started and run businesses) this does not a Guru make.<br /><br />Gerber is a conman who has built nothing more than an Amway-like pyramid scheme. People buy the book, they are then encouraged to buy into the seminars, they are then offered discounts on same if they become distributors of the book.<br /><br />Oh, that business my husband worked for? He was the last of the originals to leave in 2007. Their former roster of forty employees now stands at about fourteen - half of them the boss's immediate family, plus an office staff of bout three. All the techs are now  \\"independent contractors\\" on call from their homes 24/7. The word is the company is no longer the favored, or even mildly trusted, electrical/HVAC contractor in this area. Most people are amazed they're even still in business.
1885167776|4.0|Business books are always an interesting problem.  Are they a prop to sell consulting gigs?  Are they stretched out one note ideas?  Or do they pull off something worthwhile and can they really aid someone find the business success they are seeking?<br /><br />Another aspect of business books is their audience.  Are they written for a specific group or a general public?  Are they preaching to an already converted choir to confirm their preconceived notions or are they offering fresh insights and trying to broaden the horizons of readers?<br /><br />This book is authored by the very successful founder of one of the nation's great realtors, Keller-Williams.  Gary Keller is targeting those business folks who want to find single minded success - the kinds of self-sacrificing, dedicated, and single-minded  people he wants to hire and who will make themselves (and him) a great deal of money.  &#34;The One Thing&#34; is based on the statement by Curly in &#34;City Slickers&#34;.  Of course, Keller adapts it to his purposes.  Keller believes in focus, utter dedication to your one thing, and driving to breakthrough barriers to get to your one big purpose.  Some might call it obsession.  He is not a big believer work life balance - he actually rejects it and calls it a lie.<br /><br />The book has a couple of interesting printing twists to it as well.  For example, the key ideas are printed in red inserts.  But the coolest thing is that he has pre-marked the book for you.  In other words, the key ideas are underlined in what looks like pencil - as if a previous reader had done it for you.  But the pencil marks are printed in.  But they don't look like printed underlines, they look like pencil.<br /><br />I am positive this book can and will work well for its target audience.  When I was a younger man, I am sure I would have taken to it like a duck to water or like fire to gasoline.  Everything he says here will work if you apply it.<br /><br />Just remember that everything has a cost.  Every success (and every failure) has a price.  Nothing comes for free.<br /><br />In my own view of life, business success and work are important AS A MEANS TO SOMETHING MORE IN LIFE.  In my case, I believe first and foremost in family.  I hear any number of executives talk about this as they are on their third marriage and fathering their own grandkids.  Remember this kind of talk is cheap.  Living real life is hard.  What's that old saying?  &#34;You pays your money and you takes your chances.&#34;  There is a lot of benefit that comes from having succeeded and getting the space and time that comes from financial success.  But it is space and time to do something meaningful and worthwhile.  Business success as an END in life is a poor thing.  Money as an end is empty.<br /><br />All your work will be superseded.

B009H1S56O|5.0|It's funny how a little thing/event can get the ball rolling. After I saw my first Lana Del Rey video, I took notice. The videos and the music seamlessly flowed forward and backward in time in terms of style, references, settings you name it. More importantly it all worked & worked so well. Lana's voice and range got me thinking. How many of today's singers could belt out these songs or if transported to a retro parallel universe could perform Blue Velvet better then the originator? The contents of the box set is listed above except I don't seem to have any missing tracks on the Born to Die portion of the digipack or elsewhere, it's all here. 23 Tracks in the digipack PE=8, BTD=15 & 8 Remixes. The package closes out with a 2 sided picture vinyl record, 6 video DVD and 4 square cards that are stills from the videos.Finally there is a booklet with all the lyrics for the 23 track double CD ( Digipack).All in all great content. With the evolution of words, to pictures to vinyl records to CD's to DVD it all kind of fits the pattern. Songs that have that back in the day wholesome feel but may at a moment's notice shift course into a more adult sexually charged theme and then back again. I love the surprise element and how well Lana pulls it off time after time after time. I can't wait to see what's next. In closing there was one thing in the box set I wasn't thrilled with the Penguin Prison Remix ( B side on the Vinyl Record),less Lana and more anything else doesn't work for me! All that aside, 5 stars automatic, this music is light years ahead of anything else ( in my opinion), if you don't see it now I think you will in the future!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I love the lyrics in this album, especially Royals. This is one album I don't mind my daughter listening to.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Rush's 2002 VAPOR TRAILS sees the famed power trio of Alex Lifeson (guitar), Geddy Lee (vocals, bass) and Neil Peart (drums) back after a six-year hiatus due to Peart's tragic loss of his wife and daughter within months of each other. Reflections on this tragedy endow the lyrics with poignant meaning, and the joy of finally returning to music-making ultimately gives the album an optimism and joie de vivre that makes for great rock music. The original release of VAPOR TRAILS was a \\"loudness wars\\" disaster, the recording levels pushed up so high that all dynamic range was lost and even committed fans found it hard to listen to the resulting wall of noise. That was a great shame, as underneath the botched production was some great music. With VAPOR TRAILS REMIXED we finally have these sessions restored to better sound, and I can give this album a universal recommendation.<br /><br />Though they were pushing 50 when recording the album, the trio sounds here as if they were enjoying a second youth. After years of pleading, Alex Lifeson finally succeeding in banishing synthesizers from the studio completely, allowing him to fully occupy the melodic spotlight with his guitars. While there is something to the accusation that Neal Peart's drumming has stagnated, covering only the same sonorities we've heard many times before, he nonetheless hands in a solid performance here. Geddy Lee's bass has become aggressive like never before; witness for example how in your face he gets towards the end of \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" and \\"Freeze\\".<br /><br />The songwriting is excellent, with some twists and turns that recall the band's 1970s prog rock, but with a succintness and maturity. A few of the songs touch on the then-recent events in Neil Peart's life, though only \\"Ghost Rider\\" sees him open up completely to the listener. Elsewhere the lyrics are less personal, exploring instead themes that everyone can relate to. \\"Earthshine\\", \\"Nocturne\\" and \\"Freeze\\" speak of fear, loneliness and delusion. \\"The Stars Look Down\\" and \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" deal with the idea of predestined fate. Two songs touch on the events of September 11, which were fresh in these musicians' memories as they began to record in late 2001. Peart wrote \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" after encountering the disturbing tarot card called The Tower, which depicts bodies falling from a structure going up in flames. The title track too alludes to the planes that hit the Twin Towers. However, unlike so many musical meditations on that day that seem oversentimental and cloying, Peart's lyrics abstract that tragedy to refer instead to a universal history of calamity.<br /><br />As for the remastered sound, the album is now entirely listenable from start to finish. It is worth noting, however, that engineer David Bottrill could only do so much. Remixing salvaged the majority of the album, but since many of the parts were boosted too high in the recording process, it stills sounds a bit \\"loudness wars\\". Don't come to VAPOR TRAILS REMIXED expecting the ambience of their 1970s work or even the two albums they had released prior, but this is now a minor quibble.sion. \\"The Stars Look Down\\" and \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" deal with the idea of predestined fate.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I have never read the Harry Potter series nor seen a movie. But Rowley'a astounding popularity made me curious. I was shocked and disappointed. Very slow read; started over once to give it a chance to enhance. It never did. So I gave up after less than 1/2 way through.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This show is great and having it on blu-ray is even better! I own all seasons on blu-ray and couldn't be happier!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Insightful and honest. A great and fast read perfect for any woman with a job and interested in perspectives about work/life balance and working to advance in their career.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I thought by some of the reviews that this movie was going to be some what boring , but I liked it alot actually it has all aspects that a movie should have from my opinion. If you are debating to whatch or not i would say give it a shot its not going to be a waste of your time.
0007466706|5.0|It was an amazing book! I really recommend reading the previous book first! It didn't fall apart in the binding and is still looking good! :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a vere cute and sweet romance. If only all Vegas trips ended with a handsome and rich husband.<br />.
159562015X|5.0|This book helped me realize my strengths. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to read the book and take the test. It is worth the money.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I really enjoy the Castle series. The 5th season was especially full of twists and turns that kept me wanting more. It is a great show.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game.  The pictures are wonderful.  I had never played anything like this before and now I am hooked.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|glad I had a backup  when I tried it. the clock looks nice on your tablet, but I tried it twice, even had my son make sure I was doing it right b/c I am new to using apps. also I was messing up my tablet, I was warm to touch with a force shut down message on it. so after 2 days I uninstalled it.
B00F91H15W|5.0|If you like Sophia Coppola's style and understand what she is trying to do here, then you will love this.  The acting is spot on and the script is accurate and expected given who the characters are and what they were about in real life.  Those looking for \\"better writing\\" completely missed the point.
0783226888|5.0|My husband watches lots of movies being homebound, and this is one of his favorites.  The movie arrived in great shape and was packaged very well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider and am so glad there is an app for it.  I would download it again if needed.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have seen this musical live 3 times. Every time it gets better and better! The storyline is funny and heart-warming, the costumes are amazing, and the songs will stay with you forever. Whether you're a feline fanatic or not, this musical is awesome!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Wish it was longer!  Great DVD and so much fun to relive the music of this great group.  Wish Randy Meisner was interviewed more.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|The Cold Dish is the 2004 book that kicked off the popular Walt Longmire series by introducing the Wyoming sheriff and his fictional Absaroka County to the world.  The series is now twelve books long (with five of the books coming in the last two years) and I am steadily working my way through them all.  It is that good.<br /><br />Craig Johnson (at least in the first two books of the series I have now read) is a patient writer whose work demands a certain amount of patience from its readers.  While the highly atmospheric Longmire books require that the sheriff deal with the worst kind of criminals imaginable, it all comes together for him and the reader at a very methodical pace, a pace that perfectly fits the remoteness of the sheriff's geographic location and the limited tools he has to work with.  In the meantime, the reader intimately gets to know the little town and many of its inhabitants.  Then, finally, when all hell breaks loose, the reader feels as if he is right there watching it all unfold firsthand.<br /><br />Two years ago, four young men sexually assaulted Melissa Little Bird, a Cheyenne girl with fetal alcohol syndrome.  Now one of them is dead, having been shot in the back while hunting out in the middle of nowhere.  When it turns out that this has been no hunting accident, it is up to Longmire and his little gang of deputies to keep the other three boys alive while they desperately try to identify the shooter.<br /><br />As the old saying goes, \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold,\\" and there are a lot of people who would not be all that upset if these four young men were to end up dead.  After all, they got off lightly and went on with their lives despite what they did to Melissa Little Bird.  Walt Longmire has a long list of suspects to work his way through - and, having been the Sheriff of Absaroka County for twenty-four years, he knows most of them personally.<br /><br />The Cold Dish is great fun and it is the perfect way to get acquainted with Walt Longmire and his world.  You will want to read more, I guarantee it.h Walt Longmire and his world.  You will want to read more, I guarantee it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great demo for the game I am going to purchase the full game. This was quite entertaining. I
1476734941|4.0|A short, concise book which supplies data to support the concept of short fast to help with weight loss and health!!  It contains menus as well as recipes.  Definitely a keeper.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting and I are from the same part of England, the one-time bustling ship building area of the Northeast where we have our own language and culture rooted in the shipyards and the seafaring vessels built there. The closure of the yards during the Thatcher rule of terror was devastating to the area, coinciding with the shutting down of the coal mining industry s well.  Sting has created a monument of exceptional beauty to the area in this finely written and well recorded collection of songs.  It has an intimate collection to his earlier CD, 'Soul Cages'.
B00E9P959O|4.0|It's not Perfect but in this day and age of cloth-eared Rick Rubin type \\"mastering\\", otherwise known as \\"Mastered by Monkeys\\", this release goes some way to righting a wrong and a generally awful trend.<br /><br />Now, let's see Metallica do the same to Deaf Magnetic, Queensryche do the same to their excellent new album (the REAL Queensryche, not the Tate version), etc.<br /><br />In terms of the content, it's still the same. Some great songs but, like many artists these days filling out a CD, a bit of filler too.<br /><br />2 things the \\"old days\\" had going for it over today's short-attention-span-make-it-loud-for-mp3-masses:<br /><br />1. A Volume button, people weren't too lazy to use it back then, nowadays the powers-that-wanna-be think they need to do the aural equivalent of just SHOUTING ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />2. A 40-45 tyical running time. Put your best 40 minutes on there, save the rest for B-sides.<br /><br />IMHO Rush's best albums are AFTK through Power Windows, I don't think any of them break the 40 minute mark, if so it's not by much.
B00005214X|5.0|It's a long time since I heard this collection of songs, and to have the opportunity to buy it on CD was an opportunity not to be missed.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a huge lord of the rings fan so its a no brainer. I already saw the movie in the theatres so i knew i loved it.
B005HV6YO8|5.0|On the same day, two new Sting recordings arrived.  'The Last Ship' and 'Best of 25 Years'.  I am a northeast of Egland Brit living in Chicago, and hearing Sting's pure northeastern accent is poetry to my ears!  This is a wonderful song collection and contains bonus tracks not found on any of his previous CDs.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|The movie is hilarious and I highly recommended it. Im a big animated movie fan and this one did not dissappoint.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Every time I try to login in or make a new account on my kindle it says try again later, I need this fixed
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This movie is hilarious and I highly recommend it. I loved this one as much as the first one and look forward to the next one.
B00EDCI5IU|5.0|Agnes is amazing! The whole album is moody, haunting, dark,etc.  If you liked her last album, you'll love this one. My fav songs are Chord Left, Run Cried The Crawling, Words Are Dead, Smoke & Mirrors, September Song, and Fuel To Fire.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I already own the first three movies which are awesome and this one did not dissappoint. I love the movie.
B000002KIK|5.0|Listening to &#34;Never Say Die,&#34; is trip through time. You can hear the foundations of 80's pop music and metal in this album. You can also hear flavors of sounds that were popular at that time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Real people in believable situations, real faces, normal bodies, doing normal jobs. And then someone's behavior goes awry and a murder happens. That's how it happens in our daily lives too. Two detectives who are just above average curious analytical and smart. They both have something to prove, but different things. A puzzle and a thrill to the end.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|These guys just keep getting better, I can't wait to see them live.  Loving this album, keep it up guys!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie. I am in the process of replacing ALL of my tapes with DVD's.<br />This movie is delightful. Jimmy Stewart is the best in anything he does. Enjoy!
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|I just don't have enough LaBrie.  This album is excellent.  Every track is very good.  Reminds me a lot of Dream Theater (haha)
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Use all the time, here in the United States or when I travel abroad (Mexico, Guatemala.  it a must have.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|WOW. I don't know how they keep doing it. Another amazing album from the greatest band ever.  I hope they tour the US soon
1427214948|5.0|This series would make a great mini series.  I have so enjoyed following the complicated story of the Barrington family.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite parody's of a star trek film. It is very funny and great for those that like startrek
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why bother with TV marathons when you can just have the DVD? You know you'll watch these episodes again and want to lend them to friends.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|story was not as interesting as first two.  Also not as consistent about what is powering the armor.  The arc reactor or something else.  How did Pepper fire the repulsor with just the glove and no arc reactor?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I absolutely loved this little book. It's short and moves fast, so prepare to say goodbye to Gaiman's latest magical world far too soon.
0738711500|5.0|The colors are very rich and pretty. I am very satisfied withis purchase and how fast it was shipped. I will also purchased another deck for a friend's Birthday. I give this seller 5 star rating.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so cool I'm hooked I will have to buy more like it and I will also recommend it to my family and friends
B000002GBB|5.0|I think it is a very close battle between The Grand Illusion and this album as the best Styx album. If I could steal Come Sail Away from Illusion and put it on Eight(and get rid of &#34;Sing For the Day&#34;), I think it would be a masterpiece. This is Styx at it's best and the last great album. The post &#34;Eight&#34; albums begin a swift and steep decline, hitting rock bottom with Kilroy. &#34;I'm OK&#34; is just a simple awesome song. Of course you have the hits, &#34;Blue Collar Man&#34; and &#34;Renegade&#34; but this is one of those rare complete albums with great songs throughout with the exception of Sing For the Day. That one could be lost in the archives if you ask me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculated is very easy to use. It is very good fast for every day use.<br />..  I strongly recommend it for adult or child use.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I love being able to watch the episodes without any commercials!  Great story line.  I love the show.  Makes a great gift
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you interested and guessing.  This game makes you use your memory and critical thinking skills.  I wasn't bored at all, if anything a little frustrated when I had a hard finding clues.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had heard about this but had never seen it.  I was glad to get it.  Amazon had the best price and was available.
1904633358|5.0|Holmes and Watson have always been a favorite with our family. We are enjoying sharing Doyle's creation with another generation.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|It didn't come with the camera package we bought so the Lens hood was just what was needed for the Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book, I could not put it down! Was confusing in the beginning with all he characters and by 1/4 through you get used to them.<br /><br />Worth reading!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I guess I can't really comment on this because I never saw the whole film.  I like my zombie movies scary with no comedy. Eventhough this wasn't a comedy, it had Brad Pitt in it, so it turned to more of a zombie drama. I fell asleep several times trying to watch this and refuse to pay another 4.99 to watch again. I'll just wait till it comes out on cable.
0765325950|4.0|I have given Book 14 only a four-star rating. Although this book provides &#34;an ending,&#34; it is a rather weak one, which leaves me vaguely unsatisfied. But, perhaps I should not be so disappointed...<br /><br />After all, it is obvious that not even the Dragon Reborn could have &#34;succeeded&#34;  by stopping the Wheel. Eliminating the Dark One entirely would have only resulted in eliminating &#34;free will,&#34; that which is absolutely necessary for life to have any meaning whatever. The only real solution to this dilemma was to seal away the Dark One permanently in His prison of the Bore, thus allowing the Dark no greater access to the &#34;real world&#34; than that allowed to the Light. Balance between the two halves of Creation was thereby restored.<br /><br />I suppose that my real dissatisfaction stems from the way that this epic struggle's aftermath left far more questions than answers. Then again, that is the nature of real life. There are no real &#34;endings&#34; to any of life's stories; only &#34;an ending.&#34;
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a fantastic free app. I am really sound sensitive and have an extremely hard time sleeping. I saw this app, it was free and thought I'd give it a try. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. There are so many sounds suited for people with various likes and you can add more sounds for free, you can create your own mixes for an even more relaxing experiences. When you mix the sounds you don't hear the  loops that are noticeable in some of them. You can adjust each sound the way you like it. I use while sleeping, reading, and while doing my needlework.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The characters, plot, fights, and twists? You have exceeded my imagination. I also loved the funny metaphors. Keep it up!
B00BT1XCOU|1.0|This is one of my favorite shows, but I doubt I'll be able to finish season 8. The writing and acting are just awful this season. Don't get me wrong, it's been getting stale for a while, but this season... this season gives the word mediocrity a whole new meaning. Awful. Awful. Awful!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable arrived within a couple days via U.S. mail.  It was packaged well. The cable was in excellent condition and fit my Kindle.  The purchase price really affordable. The price, shipment, and cable exceeded my expectations.  I love making purchases on Amazon. I have never had any problems! Thank you to the seller and Amazon.
1451613512|5.0|This narration is stimulating as it describes real historic events with compelling unbiased accuracy.<br />I would recommend this book as a study guide to the real USA.
1936608898|4.0|The book is good from a motivational standpoint -- and while it has a lot of interesting science to back up its principles, it is an easy read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's A fun game, with a twist. So if you like this type of game you should really love this one.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Love this game -- it's one of the few that I have owned for over a year that I keep coming back to!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I have always detested computer games that make you think. When I play a game I want something brainless and entertaining. While Cut the Rope makes you figure out how to feed your monster around various obstacles, it's still a great way to waste, I mean, &#34;pass&#34; the time and melt a few brain cells.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love it. I love the whole Twilight saga series. I like that everyone comes together to help the others.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|When I download a game for my Android tablet, I'm getting it with the specific need of being able to play it ANYWHERE. If I have to be connected to the internet, I might as well play it on my desktop with the big screen. Contrary to what many people seem to think, WiFi is NOT everywhere. I want to be able to play my games without having to be hooked up to the web. Before anyone rants about my &#34;not rating the game itself&#34;, that's because it's unusable to me and that's a pretty specific failing of the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game. Keeps you entertained for minutes or hours. Funny to listen to and safe for the whole family. Get it!
B001KZG99A|5.0|A must have classic. Arrived fast and just as pictured. We are fans of all Marvel classics. We recommend this.
B000UZ4G8M|5.0|Love this, I'm a country fan, so it's great to hear different music that I love! ! ! ! !
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game. I just can't stop playing it.  Guess its great for developing logical thinking skills.  I would. Certainly recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman does it again with this one. I couldn't put this down. I love reading his works, and this was a superb story.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|I Loved this, except I did not go much on the Tenor, the performance of Anna Nebretko was brilliant, also the Baritone excellent.
0307591549|5.0|This book is a great resource when one's world turns upside down.  The principles are easy but the key is practicing them.  I plan to read it a second time and take notes.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love the books!  Love the movie!  Love the cast!  It's a great production all around!  Can't wait to see 2 :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book gave my such a much needed perspective of the times of Jesus. The fact that Jesus was one in a long line of jews that was considered a messiah was most interesting. Well worth the read.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Burlesque is a favorite musical not only because of the cast but the music and choreography too!  It's a classic!  Clever! Cool! Crisp! and Spicy :)
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|It is the quality that move life forward.  Morgan Freeman won the Oscar for his portrayal of Red and Tim Robbins should have for his part as Andy.  It never did well in the first weeks of release...it was a slow build in popularity.  How do you promotes a feel-good movie with R-language that takes place in a prison?  But, it is an incredibly well-crafted movie that ultimately lifts you up.<br /><br />During a trip through Central Ohio, we literally stumbled upon the locations where most of the movie was shot.  Seeing the prison in &#34;real life&#34; made me want to own the blueray - and, actually watch it from start to finish.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is a great movie, with a great story of perserverance and determination.<br />Very good characters and acting. I am a surfing nut anyway.<br />But this will be liked by anyone.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I usually enjoy Matthew and Reese's movies but MUD was an exception. The plot was interesting to a point: A couple of young boys befriend a man (Matthew) on an isolated island and become involved in his efforts to reconnect with the woman he loves (Reese). The plot was slow to unfold and I felt no connection with the characters and their plight. Honestly I found the film to be boring and by the middle of it I wanted to turn it off! The best part of the movie was getting to see Matthew with his shirt off for a bit!! Lol. Other than that I couldn't wait for the movie to end! Ugh!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Great trilogy... kept me guessing, ready for a new book to come out the ending left me hanging.  Dark and dangerous
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I must confess that I just started watching this series when a friend told me it was addicting.  She let me borrow her Season 1 & 2 DVD's so I could get caught up.  It seems to be a very accurate depiction of life in the early 1900's.  If you like romantic history novels, you will love this series.  I hope it never ends.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The guy's on fire I tell you. Brandon Sanderson hasn't written a bad book yet as far as I'm concerned. This book although slated for young adults is great for anyone. It's a wonderful new take on superhumans.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Somehow I missed Season 2 of this show, so I was elated to find it on Amazon!  The characters did not disappoint me!
B00DB624GS|5.0|Then play on is a did and this is the best sounding version on cd. You need a turntable to enjoy any better version but for the ticks and pops.
B002EMESSM|2.0|A great movie back in the day. Now very slow. Some scenes go on forever , but it is still star trek so still worth watching if you never have
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was struck by how a man could write a story with the narrator a young girl (sorry). And how can a &#34;cancer&#34; story be so funny and beautiful and heart wrenching and perfect. The writing is stunning and as I marveled at the writing itself, I also was carried away by the characters. When I finished, I ached and yet was lifted up. No story line from me, just a bow to John Green.<br /><br />Oh, I would recommend this to anyone who had the courage to feel deeply, have your heart broken, and then press on.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of THÉ finest reads I've read-listened in a long-long time. I had no idea where this ride was taking me when wé Bégin in 2013 but wé were back in my mother's world. Thé depersion, The WWII, and I was born in 1937, si my world to I was à sort of orphan too. My heart ached for those little girls. Thank you Christina, my mother's middle name
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Gotta love iron man. Love the sarcasm, keep it up Tony.  Better than the second movie. Hope there is a fourth one.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've had the weather channel on my devices for sever years. It was perfect until they decided to update it. They made it extremely hard to actually look at the weather, because they put in the whole fancy &quot;point system&quot; where the more you look the more point you get. I really don't care about points, I just wanna look at the weather.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The HD quality was great. The story was very intriguing, I really want to know Shephard's back story.....alas I will never know. This is a great show and should be watched by all Joss Whedon fans. Nathan Fillion is great!
B00095NX9G|5.0|I loved the attendion to form, posture and strength in her exercises.  I don't really do Tribal style belly dance but, purchased it for the foundation exercises.  It has been/will be very helpful.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I liked it, I really did, but the adds that came up between levels were pretty annoying.  My Kindle actually froze on one and I had to do a full reboot to get the Kindle to do anything.<br /><br />So it's good, just be prepared for the adds.  I guess it should be expected for a free app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great thanks, great product, just like the description said it was.Shipped fast. no problems or concerns. perfect condition better then expected.
