B00HU6N3LK|5|Cleaned my car leather really well.  Diluted pretty well with water.
B000E2AL1C|3|Kinda like anything...you feel there MIGHT be a performance difference...but after a few weeks or so kinda used to what you got!!
B00B5ZYY38|5|Solid, easy to install and looks great
B007WZS41I|1|JUNK!!! Turn your head one way and they turn on. Turn your head another way and they turn off/short out. Will be sending back.
B000CIT3BW|3|too much drone
B0098U91JO|3|Not a perfect fit, shows quite a bit of the door handle behind the chrome pieces. Sharp corners in a few places that could cut you. I also had to add quite a bit more double sided tape to each piece as they only come with two tiny pieces of tape.
B00LY78N8E|5|I have several sets of these, best way to store my sockets ever! Best price was here.
B00K55TJ5W|5|Easy to apply... looks great!!
B001NJ3H0C|5|As described, exactly what was needed, on time, and for a fair price.<br />My UPS is back in service. Thanks.
B002IVER3A|3|I'm giving it a 3 until I measure the gap to see if the plugs come gapped correctly.
B009II5HOY|2|These are not very good batteries. I charged them up right after they arrived and then put a load test on them. They were NOT very consistent, but NONE registered over 5.5 AH using a professional battery tester. That's well under the 7.00 AH they are rated. They are much lighter than the batteries they're meant to replace, so they probably don't have nearly as much lead in the plates. Not worth shipping back. I'll use them in UPSs carrying non-critical loads, and expect to replace them before long. I've learned my lesson about low price batteries.
B003QVISN6|5|Worked wonderfully on my Grand Am.  Everywhere I looked online almost everyone said that if these clips break then you have to purchase a whole new window regulator kit.  A dealer quoted $800 and a local mechanic quoted $400 - $600 to fix (both said it was impossible to just replace theses clips), but I spent less than $30 on these, some epoxy, and window clips (multiple parts broke under my window) and fixed it in under an hour.
B00AC6SAZE|1|Not the sound quality I hoped for,<br />I bought it for my wife and It does size down to fit her right.
B004991KOS|5|Great
B007WMY64A|1|Asking to be mugged lol
B00B0C0WPU|5|Nice
B00BG6IJA0|5|Works very well. Somewhat heavy, not absurdly so, but a very solid jack. For under my Corvette with room to spare. Would buy again.
B005DM0OC4|5|I was extremely impressed with the quality of this coolant filter kit, along with included hardware.  Installation was easy and straightforward without any issues.  This is a must have for 6.0L Powerstroke owners.
B000MD4YNY|5|As expected from Amazon good quality
B00QGNMLLQ|1|This stuff does not work at allll! It doesn't stretch at all and it just wrinkles like I've never seen before.. and I've done wraps before and this stuff is crap. It might be ok for something completely flat but it's no good on round or curved surfaces
B001L9XR2C|5|Cute product
B001O01O0U|5|Easiest job.  Saved a bundle over having the shop do it.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Fully charged out of the box, quick delivery, I'm very happy.
B00ETRETV6|5|very pretty
B00QRANHI4|5|I had very, very high hopes for this little gadget and it didn't fail me.  My husband was a smoker in our brand new car.  Six months later, he had a heart attack and had to quit smoking.  He then realized how bad it smelled in his car.  We used this for about two weeks every time he was driving and the cigarette smell vanished.  We still use it now and again just because it makes the air in the car feel really &#34;clean&#34;.  I highly, highly, highly recommend this product!
B00YWDTYEO|2|the front seat covers fit decently well, but the rear seat covers leave much to be desired.  common story of one size fits none, especially when it comes to 60/40 split bench with 60/40 lift up seats.
B00H2TD5IQ|5|Replaced this in my 05 bmw x3 over a year ago and still running with no problems.
B00826OVWW|4|Fast delivery and easy setup!!
B00A3H2K1C|5|great little tin
B00JVW78WQ|5|arrive promptly and fit perfectly. I would highly recommend.
B00KLZCVGU|5|I get all the information I need from my ECU to my phone with this using Torque - great product.
B008OAECW0|5|wonderful kit helped me fix up several shads in our motorhome with out professional help that would have cost a ton.  Easy instructions that I had no problem fixing all my shades that needed attention.
B0006PY0M8|5|Perfect fit and easy to install on my 01 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - no issues with it so far.
B00ECWFK6Q|5|It has been wrking great on my Honda
B00902FT6O|3|Fixed the drivability problem.  Car runs as great as it ever has.  Still throws the check engine light though, if you worry about such things.  You can get a code reader and just read the codes every once and while to make sure no other codes are activated.
B0041CDPQO|5|Work great on my 1-week motorcycle trip!
B007KPTTHI|5|Perfect for Evo motors with gear reduction starters installed
B000EH0ORI|4|The product was coiled too tightly in the original package and the hose was crimped when I took it out and it impeded the flow of gasoline. After leaving the uncoiled hose on the trunk of my car in the hot sun, it opened up again and the crimps went away. It now works perfectly after this minor adjustment.
B007S0KGWC|5|Great new design from PW with O-ring seals & great warranty. Perfect fit on my 2013 KTM.
B000E4SQIA|5|Got a good deal and what I needed. Arrived when said.
B0130NLX8G|5|A great thing to have in your car! Shipped super fast ! Well made- Very sturdy, Plan on buying another for hubby's car!  Good Bargain for the price! Going to buy another!
B0049W2VDO|4|Very good quality, and very sturdy.  Installation was straightforward especially if you've fooled with your seats before.  Does set the seat up 2&#34; higher than before so consider buying one for each side.
B00HHGSY30|5|worked perfectly
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Works great, I will continue to buy it!
B003QJWTYM|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00Y1CFBKM|5|we use these in the map dome lights of our ambulances, they are the perfect level of brightness and work flawless
B000BYNGLU|1|would not cool a nats rearend
B00CTA1274|5|Its ok. Its a filter
B007V2C59E|4|Bought one for my Highlander last year and now one for my 550i. Product is sturdy, perhaps a bit too rigid, but fits the windshield perfectly and provides excellent coverage. I suppose a more flexible shield might be easier to store, but probably wouldn't hold up as well.
B00L19QDG4|3|The system is not what was advertised. The ad makes you think you are getting a monitor you can adjust, which you can't, there is no remote control, and you can only connect one camera. Installed on my 39 foot RV I experience loss of signal and a distorted picture, but for $200.00 I guess I should not be disappointed.
B00M42D31U|5|Well made.....look great on our truck !
B00KR2SAFI|5|It is what it says it is
B00HAP39F6|4|Excellent fit
B00NOAPW7E|4|used once worked fine
B003SOW4Z4|5|Ended up not needing it anyone want it?
B000CG902G|5|My belt was sqeeking for the longest time. This dayco belt took the early morning sqeeks away. Good quality and fast shipping
B000BQR100|5|Quick delivery. Product was as expected.
B000ARPVNO|5|Fixed my leaking steering on my toyota.  It has been over a year and no more leaks.
B002E59QDQ|5|I bought this to fit my 2006 mazdaspeed 6 because when you buy the &#34;correct&#34; size for that car it is too large but this one fits perfectly. It smells like regular filtered air.
B003EOFEAA|5|Ever go to the beach and get your feet all sandy?  No?  Ever take your truck out in the mud, get stuck and then your boots are all dirty?  No? Ever let your wife borrow your truck and she spills her trente chai tea latte with soy milk, half pump of vanilla and a shake of cinnamon all over the floor?  No of course not, who lets their wife borrow their truck..  But if you do get yourself in one of those situations these mats are great.  fit perfect and can be easily hosed off.
B0081ZYPP2|5|Perfect fit
B001KVQQAG|5|Super easy to use and does all you need to figure out a trouble code.
B00JLN5U3O|4|These struts seem to be durable. We'll see what the warranty means. I'm told by the mechanic who installed it that there is missing attachment plate which causes a rattle, but otherwise, he was pleased with the part.
B00JH0KEDW|2|Not really pleased with the product
B00GWSFYDC|4|Very good product. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the logo fell within the second week that I bought it.
B006WCCD6E|5|The perfect replacement.. would have cost me twice as much at local parts houses.11.00 something compared to 22.00 bucks. I find most products that last a year , will last for 4 to 6 years. Probley longer.
B000C5FL84|3|Did not fit when it was recommended for my car
B00V64Z68A|1|Ordered 1.25mm which is correct size for my bike and they still didnt fit... Tried to force it in but it just ended up destroying the threading of the bolt. Not gonna bother with these just gonna order some yoshimura ones.
B000PEPCFO|5|Works great
B0036VQUOA|5|IT WORKS!
B00MT0NC1S|5|A+ all around
B00CHDBQ56|5|Great product and fit very well. The plastic was slightly thinner than OEM's is but was not by any means cheap milk carton material. I also did not have any issues installing it as all of the holes lined up perfectly. I would most definitely purchase this product again. I did have to move my wheels one direction or another to get my ratchet into some the bolts that were on the inside of the wheel well so I didn't have to take off my tire.
B000CPAV8Y|5|used for our pool heater which is same color and works perfect.
B001UOUJT2|5|Awesome mirror! Came early and so easy to put on. I watched a short youtube video how to install it and it took me 30 minutes max! Matches my other mirror perfectly and looks brand new. Best $24 I've spent especially since the car place wanted $200 to install a new mirror.
B009AQMLMA|5|This awesome sticker added 140hp to my lawnmower! Who knew a sticker could do so much!? I was so excited I got 3 more! Now my lawnmower, backpack, house and fishtank all go super fast! Watch out Honda Civic, there's a new kid in town... and that kid has a sticker!
B00CXB84N4|5|Camping without a campfire just isn't the same. Plus, s'mores are a necessity when camping with kids, and with a burn ban in effect with &#34;No Campfires&#34; posted at every campsite, this is a sanity saver. We spent one sad weekend camping during the burn ban with our lantern perched on the barren fire pit for light, and it just wasn't the same. The next camping trip, I decided I had to do something to make sure the kids get to experience a 'proper' camping trip. I researched many propane campfires and this one was the winner overall based on size, the storage bag, and the long hose connection.<br /><br />When it arrived, I hooked it up to our propane tank for our grill on our back patio, and fired this puppy up full blast for the 30 minutes recommended to 'cure' the lava rocks. The thing sounded like a jet engine, but I didn't mind, because as it warmed up and the dust and moisture was eliminated from the lava rocks, we had significant flame (so much so, the hubby was worried by way of his skewed eyesight that the flame was getting too close to the hose connection on the base because of the wind - it didn't. In fact, I checked to see if the hose and connection at the base was hot after I shut off the gas, and it wasn't even warm.)<br /><br />Our last camping trip at the ocean was the best, especially with this along - the friends we were camping with hung out in our campsite the entire time, because we had fire! And of course we made an inordinate amount of s'mores that the kids loved (the adults, too) so we definitely have a winner. Packing it back up was a piece of cake, especially with the carry bag for convenience. I wasn't sure if I'd like the lava rocks vs. the fake logs some campfires have (more of an aesthetic thing, because a pile of lava rocks just reminds me of the old gas grill I had that had lava rocks) but I'm sold on the lava rocks vs. the fake logs, because buying replacement lava rocks in the future will be much kinder to my budget. And the size of the base of this thing is such that if I really really wanted to change over to fake logs, I could do that, too.<br /><br />I also looked at some of the ones that have the metal cover (they kind of look like an old fashioned cake carrier), but opted for this one because of the difference in the base dimension - if you're going to have a campfire in a campfire pit (like we did) in this case bigger really is better. But it's not too big, so transporting it to and from the campsite was not a problem.<br /><br />We had it burning anytime we were hanging out in our campsite (which was probably 75% of the time over 3 days) and switched the 35 lb propane tank over to my camp kitchen when I made meals - between the two, and in spite of the constant fire going, we maybe only used up half of the tank of propane, if that. We did not, however, have the flame up high - we didn't need to because it puts out warmth even on a low flame, and of course we didn't want a high flame for roasting marshmallows, especially if you like them toasted a nice golden color like I do.<br /><br />Bottom line is this is definitely worth getting so you can have a campfire even during a burn ban (if the campsite allows it, of course - always check first). We plan to use it in our backyard when we have parties (or just hanging out) since we still haven't gotten around to digging a fire pit out back yet. Hopefully the convenience of this won't drop the priority of putting in an actual fire pit out back down to the bottom of the 'to do' list. ;)of the base of this thing is such that if I really really wanted to change over to fake logs, I could do that, too.<br /><br />I also looked at some of the ones that have the metal cover (they kind of look like an old fashioned cake carrier), but opted for this one because of the difference in the base dimension - if you're going to have a campfire in a campfire pit (like we did) in this case bigger really is better.

B00F0ZXKW0|5|Awesome product and fast shipping
B008R0PKKU|3|Eh....really don't &#34;see&#34; a difference.
B005M3NG4M|5|On my lowered Saleen (Saleen Racecraft suspension w/ removed lower Iso's & STAGG Shocks), I completely flattened the stock bump-stop. This one is much shorter, even vs. what was left of my stock one, and I no longer have to hear the back bottoming on the stop every time I hit a bump (which is every 2 feet in PA).
B010W2SVYC|2|They do look nice, and have the proper connector. Only downside, is the plastic nut they give you that does not fit.
B0050SFVO2|1|It broke on the clip right away. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option
B00EC8XBCA|5|This DOES NOT fit the Yaris Sedan.
B000P6UO2I|4|Very nice unit, I have not used all the features, but I am satisfied with the product.
B000FQ02L6|5|Fit great!
B00MS98WEW|1|This will not fit GM muscle cars, regardless of what the company says.  The back of the light is not stock dimensions, and you will have to cut up your vehicle to make them fit.  Expect zero customer service from Octane Lighting, and they will demand you pay return shipping for a refund of an item you never would have bought if they had an accurate list of what it would fit.
B000XFNVIK|5|Good quality leather ay a very affordable price..infact I ordered another one. Can't leave home and bike without it. To top it all, delivery was well ahead of time.
B00WUV62AE|5|For now, is running with  no problems.
B0093AAGPM|5|Awesome product, just as described.  It's big (obviously, the window's big, right?) - but easy enough to roll up.  You just have to find a place to keep it in the van.  Definitely does a great job at blocking out the sun and noticeably keeps the van cooler.
B000BYB1Z8|5|awesome
B006R9DT24|2|Not a perfect match.
B000SNBSMI|5|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend that has a Victory.... It fits perfectly... Was shipped prompt and for the money I was very pleased!!!!!..... I would suggest this as a great deal.....😉
B006N9HTUG|5|Works
B002LYQALQ|5|works great, well worth the money<br />a person can place the oil exactly where they want it using the exact amount they want.
B0015PK3AG|5|Works great.
B008XNRENW|5|Works well with an obnoxious smell!
B0049U3LF8|5|Worked great and came in on time.
B004005T70|5|Easy to install and looks great.  Seamless replacement for OEM taillights.
B00E3M82XI|5|Buy this for your Mercedes Benz. Fits perfect. 2011 E350
B007HA7RF2|4|ok
B001GJ7A5W|4|Looks good bolted down easily bit haven't used under boat
B001L9VTMW|5|It's Just Awesome
B00AAY3AKI|5|fits great in a 2015 ford flex. awesome product
B00L42LS4A|1|Hoses don't fit! And it says it's for a 2010 2.5L 4 cyl fusion!
B00EBT9566|5|Very fast service and works very good
B004AIRWPO|5|Perfect fit.
B00YICWOB4|4|Thanks
B0036BM2FG|4|Works as described for my vehicle.  Saved me the trouble of driving to auto parts store.  Easy installation. 2004 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 4x4.  Took s little longer than expected but not in a rush for this delivery.
B00ABYVT64|1|the suction straw is too long and they break. once the long straw is broken you can no longer spray !!! 2 out of 3 bottle failed on me within 2 months. It cannot handle meguiars wheel brightener which is a strong acid. the bottle stopped spraying !
B0046KIABG|1|Falls off all the darn time. I stuffed it in the glove box on my mule. Now it doesn't work at all
B00NWQ9ZEQ|5|Funny, as described.
B00RGZWIW0|5|OMG this is terrific!  It is nice and large and fits perfectly in the back of my SUV.  It is so sturdy and and is so easy to fold up and latch closed if needed.  Love it!
B00PBO0Z3M|1|This is a safety concern and I am not impressed.These lamps became loose in their adjustment bracket after a year and the factory connectors are loose in the housing.. Bulbs fall out. These are telltale signs of cheap housings. Plus these are no longer under warranty. I pissed away $80. Will be going with TYC in the future. Should have known to stick with them.
B004W0QISM|5|I just keep ordering these things, I have them on everything.
B007GPAVH4|5|Awesome
B00VA1EP4K|5|Very good quality! cant believe it was only $8.99 with Prime. Excellent, must have for all cars and trucks.
B00B43VKQU|5|This is a great antenna, signal was not degraded for me so it works well.
B00WL8X3HQ|5|Great lights! They are packaged very well. They work great. You do need to know how to splice to your accessory tho
B00IMVNKOM|1|Starting to leak where the lever attaches to the unit.  Less than a few months old, used maybe 4 times.  Very disappointing.
B00RMJ33W4|5|I did not know about plasti dip, now that I do I am hooked.  We used it on my sons car to add a racing strip.  Looks great and we can peal it off when he gets tired of it.
B00DW6RYUI|4|It's super cute! I get so many compliments! I got it to match my seat belt cover things! It depends on your mirror size though, I recently switched cars and it fits better on my car with the smaller mirror. But it's nothing to fret about if it doesn't totally fit perfectly, it still adds character to your car, and is worth the money.
B000BB40Z4|1|It stayed on for about 2 weeks then fell down. Maybe because of sun exposure; it was too hot this summer in NY.
B00JIIZCM6|5|review for discounted price. works great on my leather couch!
B009FN9Z1I|5|Bought these for my son, he had no problem putting them on. Picture speaks for itself.
B003V3PZIK|5|Great kit for any starter, It works hand to hand with my Griot's Garage 10813STDCRD 6&#34; Random Orbital Polisher with 10' Cord. The price is higher then the other product, but I got to say you get what you pay for. This is some great quality product here. I would not hestite to reorder once they are out. Highly recommended it.
B000VKXA7Y|5|very nice
B005EIWNSK|5|chinese scooters suck and break. i gave away this product with my broken down for no reason scooter that i sold to somebody who wants to take the time to fix it. it looked solid and was the right fit for a zuma knock off 50cc taotao black and white style &#34;zummer&#34;
B00I9299IK|3|Doesn't seem louder than the OEM horn....
B00YKZ829M|5|Very durable!! And it's super simple to get it all put together, only issue I had was one of the screws are way down in there and had to purchase a screw driver to just get that one screw out
B000CIY6TQ|5|Excellent product and instant shipping with Prime. Great price, too.<br /><br />This cooler comes complete with 4' of 5/16&#34; hose, plus coupling, clamps and ties....I suggest you order an additional 4' of hose to make certain you have nuff.<br /><br />It took me all of 15 minutes to install this cooler on my new Nissan Frontier after watching the video published my manufacturer on youtube.
B00RBZSMQG|4|Not so much. Despite Looks cool on my red Stang convertible.
B004BCDX9S|5|Arrived very quickly; fit perfect! Great price!
B007011MZO|5|Very detailed...
B009TBBW08|5|Excellent product.  Easy install.  Looks good on my truck.
B008G2B1KM|5|yes
B00KTIYXLU|5|First set didn't work well, contacted the company and they sent me another set which has been flawless!
B002DHZZC6|5|i wonder how many people will actually dial the number
B005UXZ2XM|5|Works great
B004J2ME04|5|The only kind of shock I would purchase....
B002ZKP1GQ|4|Product seems very good. Prepaid shipping label for the core was not provided as explained in product description and had to be requested. Once that was sorted, everything went fine.
B0022Y7CTO|5|Most comfortable hand grips!
B000C98EH0|4|Direct bolt up and seems to be a good product. That would give it a 5 star if it came with a gasket. You will need one, and you will have to buy it from a dealer everyone else will try and sell you the wrong one.
B003ZWJR6I|5|looked ,worked ,and fitted exactly like the old one replaced
B000C9PVH6|4|Ordered a bunch of AC Delco Pro. Replacement Parts for my steering system. All work well, seem sturdy, installed properly, and have proper ball joint rubber caps. Only complaint was the factory grease- half the parts had next to jone, the other half had none. Take advantage of the grease points and push out the stock crap for some decent grease.
B00DC8C9EM|5|Great product!
B00FSG3DTG|4|Very good task light.  Replace the incandescent bulb in our motorhome range hood.  Much whiter and brighter than the old bulb.  Choose this bulb for its director head and higher lumina for the cook top.
B00GSAUHB8|3|I found it very difficult to fold back into place after using it.
B00APLYAVO|5|Very blue
B002ZBWKAU|5|I've bought one for each of my cars and for several of my daughter's friends for their cars.
B0007XRYAY|5|The Lund Interceptor fits my QX4 like a glove!
B000CJ1OZ4|3|Love the idea on not having to take keys with on our day trips.  Have difficulty getting the lights to come on when touching it to turn on lock, meaning I have to enter the code twice to get the lock to open.  Additionally not higher as the latch is very stiff and you have to slam the door to get it to latch.  From the inside we pull the lever so we don't have to slam the door to get it to latch.
B00KYBOIGC|5|Have not used but looks like it will be great.
B003CGH13S|5|VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS TOP! FITS GREAT. AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE. TAKES LESS THAN AN HOUR TO INSTALL AND IVE NEVER INSTALLED ONE. MY ADVISE,  WATCH VIDEO ON YOU TUBE, DIRECTIONS NOT VERY USEFUL. CAME WITH UPPER DOOR SKINS, ITS COMPLETE! I JUST WISH IT WOULD OF COME WITH NEW SCREWS TO ATTACH TO HEADER.
B00DU66UWI|1|Worthless purchase!!!  Wired them to my Jeep for license plate, burned through the thin wire as soon as I turned them on!!
B004FGRDEQ|5|This was a little trickey to install, but my 13 year old son did it so cant be too hard.  It is very nice and quiet.  This is come tough thick material
B00NPYXAWS|5|Have not needed to use this and hope I never do.  But great quality for little price and I was happy to give one to each of my kids and their husbands, and well as two for us and one for a friend.  I still have one left to give to someone.  Everyone should have one of these in the car.
B00BCRMC3I|2|My granddaughter likes the seat covers . However, she and her boyfriend , had a difficult time installing. Both said the instructions were very bad!!  Took a long time to install. That is why only 2 stars.
B007VYBRFA|4|Tool worked well, but the instructions were somewhat cryptic.
B0024GQI9K|4|Fits a little big but I am a small person, usually wear a small in helmets but wish I would've went with an extra small.
B000IY8OI8|5|works great nice low price real nice fit
B00KQUXERA|5|Perfect! Inexpensive, makes the LED taillights flash at normal speed...does exactly what it says.
B005TBSJIU|4|I'd give it five starts if it was near all black. 20 bucks is an incredible deal on wheels. The 30's fit perfect. They have a Velcro strap on the left side and the ratchet belt as well. Makes them fit ever so perfectly around my waist. They are a little heavy.. Which I don't care for but that's extra weight when I race bmx. I guess you get what you pay for lol. Thanks Amazon. Needed track pants anyway so this was a good budget item
B002G3PHSE|5|It's a good product, but don't use it without water or if you have an obstruction at the windshield wipers.<br />They will show wear signals quickly doing like this. This item is very silent. I recommend the product.
B00BMEG1S8|5|Came just as it said definently increased HP 5-10 and torque. Great product for great price.
B00BITL5AQ|4|Decent replacement 3rd door handle for the price.
B000BQLVKG|5|These are great.  I use them to hold together my beehives in strong wind.
B000X9UPU8|5|Great camper step for my 2005 F-450 service body truck and pop-top camper.  Allows for easy access to the camper, for my injured wife.  Thank you!!
B00EE56UAG|1|Lock did not work.
B001O0XLX8|5|Extremely quiet & very little/almost no dust. Initially thought something was wrong w/ my front pads, replaced these just because of how inexpensive they were and it cut all brake noise I had on my Saleen.
B001OCVHDC|5|Great quality but will need to be secured down as it will tip over as base is only 12&#34; wide and will get top heavy.
B00Z8TGR4G|5|Best bar for price and 2 year warranty you can't find better.
B009DK5YQS|5|excellent, highly recommend them
B001O7PNNM|5|its works to remove scratches on my car.
B000GU5IH4|4|Well made, but the size that was said to fit my Honda Aero Shadow 750 is too small.  I didn't get the larger size, I guess because of the big warning &#34;This does not fit your model&#34;.<br /><br />Order this as though it wer a T-Shirt for a middle-age man:  Forget the size they *say*.  A size larger is probably going to be more comfortable.
9539751047|5|I purchased for a friend who collects stickers of country flags.  It is made of good vinyl and the coloring was great.  My friend really liked.  I was also glad to see that the American flag sticker was made in USA.
B00CHSTGKI|1|Weak and unlockable sums it up. What more do you have to say. Now it you have low/no expectations add 3-4 stars and your good to go . . . Slam some good Yakima's up there and your ready for anything.
B0037Z3AHA|5|I'm on the third one of these 1 factory and #2 of these and only have 117,000 miles on my car?
B00DEC0I2Q|5|Simply put, it's what I wanted/needed to save the carpet in my new 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  It's the same one the dealership had for $10 less than they wanted.
B0018086WA|5|Exactly what I needed.

B0068FV596|5|Decent bar risers for the money. All different sizes in one. Good deal and product.
B000FQ1J40|5|These have been on my Jeep for some time now. They still look brand new and work great!
B000WOEP3W|5|Perfect fit
B00K89VALG|1|Article came boxing torn up and it appeared to be been tempted to install it will not align not even sure its for this Arctic Wildcat 1000 4 online description says it'll fit either it is really bent in transit or does it belong to the Arctic Wildcat 1000 4 have have set for a return request or replacement with proper part
B002N5JCE0|1|Stops working after a year.  This regulator completely shut off my water supply after being in service for a year.  Sorry -Chinese Throw-away quality.  Now I have to go buy another one.
B00032KC30|5|Was exactly as advertise and was very good fit and good size
B007RVTAK6|5|product good
B00F8LEB9W|5|works great
B000WK1RZ0|3|Was delv very fast but the windsheild was not as good as i hoped for. The windsheild did not fit my bike. The brackets were a joke , i had to bend the brackets to fit. The brackets have loosened  up twice within a couple of days of riding.
B001UCGQ28|4|no issues as expected.
B00IITPIDO|5|The brakes work great!!!
B00MKBTA80|5|got it for my grandfather.<br /><br />he loved it!
B008Y5CJA2|5|Best pair of boots I've ever purchased. Walking is comfortable and they are fashionable
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Super bright. Highly recommend
B000FQ7H4G|5|Fits my '03 wrangler as advertised. Splines were indexed correctly (I read some other brands have issues with this) and it went on without a hitch.
B00M4CCDDO|5|It fit like the original
B000KL5BS0|5|Not much to say about WeatherTech products. They do what they're supposed to do very well and are made right here in the USA! These mats fit my truck the way I expected them to (perfect). Can't go wrong with WeatherTech.
B000N321MO|5|I was installing an LCD rear view mirror and dash cam and needed to test fuse slots in a Forte. This is exactly what I needed and found it at a great price.<br /><br />I like that it has a large alligator clip on the negative end. I was able to easily attach it to the frame of the car without it popping off. The ground wire is quite long (2 feet ish) and VERY thick. I was very impressed with it's construction, I was expecting something cheap based on the price I paid.<br /><br />I later used it to test Prius fuse slots for another dash cam install and again had zero issues. It clipped on nicely to a bolt while I wiggled underneath the dash where the fuse box is (very inconvenient place) and I was able to test the slots without the clip coming loose and having to wiggle back out.<br /><br />I'm not an electrician and only dabble in simple wire/switch installs and only because I have devices such as this to find not only which fuse slot is hot while the car is off, but which side of the fuse slot is hot for the fuse tap.
B00GD4NU36|5|Shipped fast and oem part 01 jeep grand cherokee 4.7
B000UOHUF4|1|Same as the Chilton manual
B004X9287M|5|Great product and fast shipping I would recommend purchasing it.
B001AJH1HK|4|These worked pretty darn well. Easy to put on and take off and offered a far better view of what's behind my travel trailer when pulling it. They do have a little bit of vibration but nothing that I considered to be bad. All in all I was very pleased.
B002N5YDG2|5|Easy Installation, seems to turn on at less then the start temperature has not shut off have switched off manually, not been in one place long enough to see if it will shut off automaticicaly
B000HE6ULC|4|works good
B001XOVF9C|1|One use in out camper and it ripped!
B00B57U98A|5|it fits perfectly
B00SJTN5U6|4|This is a great tool!  If you do your own service on your bike you really need this tool. Couldn't be happier!
B00EFBJ5D8|3|Picture looks a lot better than the actual item. Cheap looking from close up, looks ok from the distance.. It will do the purpose and hoping it will last for a while till I find a good one.
B00AESQXAO|1|Product came with frame bent.
B007LICJ0S|5|Pretty bad-ass, for sure.  These go on the front license plate of my Jeep, and definitely give it a little attitude. I'm about as hardcore a shark enthusiast as a mainlander can be, so these are really my kind of statement.  Pretty solid aluminum construction, too. Going to last a while.
B00LO0M918|5|I was a little cautious about this product with some mixed reviews, but they work great for every light in our camper (including the outside light).  The only negative is that the light is a little blue, where we are accustomed to a yellow-ish hue in the camper from the old incandescent lights.<br /><br />This is a cheap way to get brighter, energy efficient lights in your camper.<br /><br />As others have written--if the light doesn't work, take it out and turn it 180º.  I do wish the lights themselves were labeled with an A and B (on each side) so that you could easily tell which direction you were plugging them in (for all the other lights in your camper).
B00AKL61B6|5|fast service nice product
B00A6GNAVE|5|Fits Perfect on the Juke, the Juke shown on this item is mine and the product is just as described. Had it on for over 2 years in the heat, rain and plenty of passes through the carwash and its holding up like a champ.
B000EVWDU0|5|Great tool to have - and inexpensive.
B00EHIOBD8|5|can finallysee on my road glide at night
B00F7EA25C|5|Very well made and looks great.
B002YCDU7C|5|Works great.
B000MD4YNY|1|Does not remove any transmission fluid from an open bucket, just gets enough inside to leak all over the place. Buy the OTC Blue one, that one works great.
B00FX9UCNI|5|it fit without issue and was installed on my 2015 Jeep JKU in under 1hour. the bar is high up against the body and the steps are lower at a very easy place to get in with.
B000IYI2NU|5|Great filter with good air flow
B00AN5S8W4|5|So far so good!
B00CODDTZ4|4|Got the X-Large. I'm 6'1&#34;, 165lbs, 44 chest, 31 waist, 35 sleeve. Jacket shoulder fit was good, tummy area was a bit blousy, guess its cut for chubbier dudes, should be ok with a vest or sweater I guess. Sleeves were just right. Leather is heavy and of decent quality for the price. Pockets are GREAT!! For this price? Its a winner. Should break in nicely after a few months of wear.
B00K1HQSLC|5|After hooking the purchased solenoid up the bike started right up and has not killed the battery since. Only problem was the wrong connectors so save your old ones to splice in.
B000EDQQCY|5|Fit like a glove!
B001DKPMAO|5|Love the product.  Was delivered quick.  Looks great on my car and it seems durable.  We shall see if its still shiny after the winter.
B002P8SZZM|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 4-Runner.
B00I0ZXV5S|5|Rigid base is the way to go, and with plenty of extension, this makes it super simple for my son to buckle himself into is booster seat. If you are on the fence about buying this, you should go for it.
B00QW5PE76|5|Just what I wanted.
B0075XGZFO|5|Easy to apply... looks great!!
B000ARPVOS|5|Mopar brand filters outperform nearly all aftermarket filter...and they look cool too.
B003NI8DZU|5|These replacement supports are fantastic. My wife dealt with failing supports for months because I didn't realize how easy they were to replace. These fit perfectly and operate flawlessly. I'd recommend the product and the company to anyone.
B000LNTN2C|5|Great product.  I used it with command hooks and hung it up on my cabinet door for more storage space!
B00KJ8IW8A|2|I Ordered This Kit For My 2006 Subaru And It Turns Out OTS The Wrong Bulb.u Don't Know If To Send Back The The Whole Kit OR INNOVITED can send me just the bulbs. They're to big and don't even go in the replacement  socket.
B007TY0E1K|5|works perfect
B00BT3TDQE|5|Excellent
B00TGPQQTE|4|Nice and portable, this little kit is made of durable plastic with and easy open flip up catch.<br />There are a good variety of fuses which should take care of most any need.<br />Keeping this in the glove compartment for easy use.<br />Each compartment is clearly marked with the type of fuse, making them easy to grab quickly.<br /><br />Great and handy to have!<br /><br />*Provided for my opinion and review
B00JUZI8LO|5|Husband loves his Bronco's!!
B00BM9JIBU|5|Great, love them. Good outfit to buy from
B000FN8H52|5|Use to touch up paint chips and scratches.  Works great when I need to scuff up a very small area in preparation for primer and/or paint.
B008ESIGII|3|Product fit well,I had a issue with the headlight wire harness connector. 2 male terminals would not lock in place and loosing contact, i had to take my old harness and install it in the new head light in order for it to work properly.
B000KBE9Y2|5|fit perfect really help keep my vehicle clean glad I purchase them.
B001HRLL12|5|Bright lights easy to install.
B00FXIRCIW|1|Ordered red, but looked like pink... Never been this disapointed
B000M5Y720|5|Price was right and work as expected!
B004GSYAIA|5|A++++++
B00DRYMPFO|5|VERY nice ride in 1500 series truck. Slightly firmer, but handles big bumps with ease instead of shudder.
B00G620ZVU|5|Excellent product.  Well worth the price.  Worth every penny.
B0002VFE30|5|Were easy to weld on to the camper.  Work well
B00J2Z9HLW|5|Great price,very good product, fast delivery.
B002M1BWM0|5|It worked !!  That was the important thing.  And it fit as described.
B008Y71HXU|5|Delivered as promised
B000CK0C10|5|it works
B00GYOCWAC|5|nice auto floorliner
B008I2MKO6|5|Excelent
B00ONH8C24|4|What I needed
B00J62RRKO|5|These look great on my truck. They took me about 30 minutes to install by myself and you don't need to be a handy person to accomplish this alone. They are very sturdy and have no play when standing on them when I load my daughters into the truck. Great product.
B00T60QD42|3|Look nice and fit when but only for a short time color fades fast
B000BYB2J8|5|Great windshield wipers on my Subaru Impreza. No Complaints
B00FALVU8A|5|Wax on, wax off. That's it. You'll be the Karate Kid in no time except you'll probably have a better looking ride. It left my Tuxedo Black Ford Flex looking better than when I picked it up off the lot, and it took me about an hour. Better metal flake sparkle, deeper, shiny black, and you won't be worn out when you finish. I love the Chemical Guys products!
B00S5ZXC7A|5|Worked perfectly with my ipad to diagnose codes.
B0051Y2XGE|2|The strut bar did not fit my 1993 Civic HB. It will require major or professional alteration in order to make it fit.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B00OUGGUTU|5|[[VIDEOID:54fd69b6ae4896d5f780d4cb87ebfba7]]Very nice PA. I am including detailed pics to help with install and a video to give you an idea of how loud this system is. Please excuse my dogs in the video. But they are also testament to the sound. ;)<br /><br />Upon opening the box: (3 pieces)<br /><br />Siren: You will get the siren with mount connected to about 6in of white(neg) and red(pos) wiring. And about 10ft of black cord that run from the siren and then into the car that will plug into the hand held.<br />PA Handheld Microphone Control:<br />Has 7, labeled, sound buttons and voice speaker.<br />Handheld Dash Mount:<br /><br />I did find it odd that it DID NOT have instructions. But it is pretty basic install. Hopefully the pics will help. Please ask questions!<br /><br />INSTALLATION:<br />we mounted the Siren speaker above the right front wheel well, under the hood of my husbands Chevy Silverado. He grounded the black wire to the frame where he also fastened the speaker. The red wire needed about 5ft of extra length to be ran and connected to the outgoing power of the altenator. (Pic) It is pretty standard on many PAs to need extra (pos/neg) wire.<br />Next we ran the 10ft phone looking cord through the side door and into a hole in the side base of dash.(pic) He was able to continue that wire hidden up under dash and connected it to the hand held.<br />Then we installed to handheld mount, via sticky backed hook.<br />Easy installation.<br /><br />Testing it: see video<br />The handheld has 7 labeled buttons.<br /><br />Sound of the sirens are very loud and clear. The voice is a bit more quiet. But that may very per user.<br /><br />Overall great product. Great Price. My husband has had many PAs. He is very pleased with this one!<br /><br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions.<br />Pics and vid will take longer to approve than my written review. So if you do not see pics or video yet. Check back very soon!<br />*I received a discount in return for my honest review
B00IKBO5YI|5|These are very Bright, love them. Highly recommend these to everyone. I was very pleased I ordered more....thank you
B001NZX5DU|5|Thanks
B00IBOQF1A|5|Perfect match and fit for a 2015 Ford Escape.
B003BZQ7IU|5|Allstar Performance Clamps work great for fuel lines which I used them for. They don't cause any rubbing issues and always hold the lines exactly where you put them.
B00FXHCQGQ|2|Cut was sloppy and did not arrive in the requested color.
B00URV8MFC|5|Great value. Used on car inner and outer doors over noico base.
B00537GKBI|5|Easy to install, instructions clear and easy to understand, works perfectly right out of the box.
B004X96DQ4|5|good product
B007GR664O|5|EZ and look exactly what i order fit good also.
B000C9O3H0|5|Good product and worked well with no problems.
B002E2WMWG|5|I installed these bulbs for the factory foglights on my 2015 Nissan Xterra Pro4X....I love how it looks, and hope it will last a long time!
B006UGZYCM|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B003UXZ6RG|4|It's a nice cover but too big for a 2007 Honda civic.
B00Y080ANU|5|Just as posted
B000CIPUR8|5|It works! Just saved $400.00! Wow!
B000CITTXO|1|Quality is not what I would expect for the price
B00IO94GD6|5|Packaged well, arrived in one week. Threw them on and broke them in properly. During the break- in period, there were minor, intermittent squeals which quickly went away. No pulsing, smooth and quiet. Got about 2,000 miles so far with no problems so far- and I don't expect there will be any.
B00N65CS8I|5|Minion gets lots of laughes we all need one from time  too time..
B002BVXM92|5|I ran three consecutive tanks of gas with a 16 oz. bottle of Cataclean each time.  The acceleration & downshift on my old Ford Taurus are now like new, the temperature guage is lower, the tailpipe gases smell fresh even during warm-up;  there is no more smoke or burning sulfur smell when I &#34;floor it&#34; on the highway;  the stubborn ping is completely eliminated.  I even removed one O2 sensor and verified that it is shinny clean!  Cataclean's main ingredients are acetone, xylene and propanol, all of which have been highly effective in removing carbon from engines since at least the 1950s.  Its mixture is patented to clean catalytic converters (https://www.google.com/patents/EP1289656B1?cl=en), since it releases vapors that clean during combustion (unlike most other additives, see http://www.cataclean.com/emissions-crusade/passing-the-mot-3/the-catalytic-converter-2/).  This product cleans all the cars fuel components, tank to tailpipe.  Some users report that, after ten tankfuls, very old cars stop burning oil (because carbon is removed from stuck piston rings, releasing them so that they hold back oil properly).  I've personally been using it (or its competitors) to lower emissions in all types of cars since the 1980s, even late-model Mercedes Benz's in my family.  The results are always excellent!  The effects last for thousands of miles, depending on the condition of the car.  Some people on the Internet speculate that Cataclean might harm fuel pumps and lines.  I've never had any such problems whatsoever.
B000CHGJEM|5|Worked perfectly on my 2005 Mercedes E320 CDI. Note - if you have the E320 CDI, you will need two of these pulleys. The OEM dust cap doesn't fit onto this pulley, but no biggie.
B00IBIPVT8|5|Great buy
B00KWETWZ8|5|Item as described!
B00SUQT6II|4|Very bright. A little difficult to mount, they didn't feel like they were clipping correctly in my 2010 Dodge Journey.
B00YY7M4AO|5|It works great, very easy to pair with my Galaxy S4 and gives me the information I need. The whole experience was great. I received couple of really nice personal emails from Ozay Gear that asked how my purchase was, contact information if there was a problem and links to more information about the product. Very nice personal touch.
B001Q4XIHG|5|Great product horrible attachment design! It's very handy once you get it mounted just prepare to be mad when installing. Bottom plate should be threaded!!!
B0002LBGWI|5|This product works wonders! The moment you spray it on some of the tar, you can see it eat at it. You'll see streaks of tar just flow down. You'll have to wait a bit of course, to let it soak in and break down the core of the tar. Otherwise, the tar will be &#34;tarminated&#34;<br /><br />One thing, don't leave it on your car for too long, or let it dry because it'll eat away at your clear coat and you don't want that to happen.
B003OAES8I|5|Makes the front of my jk look great.
B00JIEX722|1|As other reviewers have commented, these blink on and off as if by design. Will have to get another product to replace...to be avoided!
B001AWU6KQ|5|Great product, my wife is happy she has a handle to grab getting in and out of the Jeep. I ordered 4 but only needed 2 for my 4 door, they won't fit above the rear doors in my Wrangler
B0031C8L6E|4|Very good assembly and fit perfectly.
B000C2WDQ0|5|Quick ship is what it is
B00SR1QEAY|5|Great price worked great
B004A6KCVM|5|Works great!
B005FL0572|4|I got them on the date it was supposed to be here and I've bought them before and I love them. They are way better than OEM.
B005DUTCAQ|3|For the moment no issues. The LEDs are working as expected.
B008QR1ASK|4|As advertised.  No complaints.  Would order from them again
B005U805X4|3|Nice maybe bit overpriced though.
B001V8PRAS|5|Good product and easy to use.
B004XIAUMI|5|Work for a dealer tech had no problems installing. We will see what winter brings in upstate my.
B008F5RX84|1|Did not fit the car it was listed to fit.
B00P3XSET8|5|Perfect, exactly what I wanted and at a good price thank you!
B0002VAZA2|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B0000AY2BR|5|YES!~
B000BZXR6I|5|Works great and saved us a trip the auto parts store.  We live in the country and it is a pain to find the parts you need in stock on a Saturday morning.
B00H7HD8LW|4|For $20 the covers are better than expected (considering you get floor mats too) A little tricky to install but it wasn't that hard...just seat covers guys.<br />Just make sure to read the description and make sure it does fit your car and the type of seats you have...otherwise you will end up complaining about it like other users here.<br />Would've been 5 stars but I didn't like the seatbelt covers, the Velcro part kept getting stuck to the seat and my clothes
B00QMTAZ1W|5|looks good. led lights when fuse is blown or missing, but whatever device is being powered needs to on for light to come on
B000V8QVX6|5|She love sit. Great in the car!
B00EDFM83A|5|Very nice replacement for the factory incandescent bulbs that use too much power and generate WAY too much heat.  These bulbs are about 90% as bright as the incandescent bulbs and generate NO heat.  It would help to know which way to insert them, but if they don't light up simply insert them the other way.  I have had a few of them go out and I had to wiggle them to get them working again (maybe a loose connection).
B00GRHRYHM|3|I like they are quick to remove and put back on...However, they do not stay tight and move as you drive down the road...
B00QHDR26Y|5|Perfect fit on my Kawasaki 550SX Jet Ski.  Feel much better knowing the ski will shut off when I fall.
B00D3YEGO6|5|The product arrived pretty fast .The packaging was of high quality and so was the product. The instructions were clear and easy to follow (the pictures helped as well). I've been receiving so many compliments on my license plate frame.I would definitely recommend and purchase products from The Friendly Swede again.
B00AQKC7LO|5|Good reading light. Very bright and quality made.
B00O85TDTM|5|very good
B00M1OUBES|5|I never would have guessed a product like this would work so well and is so portable!  I keep mine with me on the road all the time.  I bought one each for my sons too!
B00SXC43BY|4|Did the job for my boat trailer that needed new lights. Brake lights are bright and easily seen, wire could be a little less cheesy though, had trouble with the ground wire breaking when I was installing it. But for the price I'm not complaining too much.
B00XULVDHK|3|Its ok, doesnt cover a whole lot of the window.
B0094X6IU0|3|The color of this paint pen was a perfect match to my car, but it was a pain to apply and looked smeared and imperfect no matter how careful I was.  The clear coat pen especially was messy, and the applicator was difficult to use.
B00415BFEA|5|does the job - whats not to like?!
B002J858HQ|1|[[ASIN:B002J858HQ Chemical Guys AIR10216 Leather Scent Premium Air Freshener and Odor Eliminator - 16 oz.]]<br /><br />Within minutes the smell of leather is completely gone. Waste of money.
B006YU7G8E|5|Genuine Honda fluid.
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Again, will come back and buy when we have another customer needing. Thank you
B0089GD8KG|4|Good fit and comfortable. Wear them regularly.
B000BQWLE6|3|i did not look at the size of them but they will work some where
B001TLC12E|5|I love it!!! Materials are soft and fits to my car seats.  Thanks a lot!!!
B001K7TZ6C|5|keeps your face warm.
B00651CIL2|1|piece of junk. fell off while driving. do not buy. seriously didn't even last 6 months,.
B0024NO97Q|5|Makes my care look like new again.
B000QV2D3U|5|Works perfectly.  I had both original clips snap on my window, and these fit precisely.  I will be buying another set to fix a friend's window as well.
B00008RW9U|5|Great for wiping down car of dust.  Never scratches.
B00JQYNHWY|5|Excellent bowl cleaner and tank sanitizer. Bubbles up and cleans by itself
B005FKMQDO|1|This was the wrong brake parts had to send them back
B00NWT66CM|5|perfect fit
B00LSV65QS|5|Stuck good.
B00V4049K2|5|My car was starting to smell a bit like a locker room, so I bought this bad boy. It came in at 4pm, I set it out in the sun (as directed), put it in the car, and the next morning there was absolutely no odor. Even after a trip to the gym, when I got back in the car, I didn't smell anything. Definitely recommend this!
B001OBKD56|3|I've never done brakes before so I ordered this not knowing that they were different. However it arrived on time and looks great lol. I'm giving three stars only because it's not listed as front.
B00WTJ5C44|4|Nice blue color but not very bright, stock lights were actually brighter. But hey for the price I like them.
B00J11NVLO|5|I bought this for my DH to use in his 2014 Prius C.  It fits perfectly, rolls up nicely with the Velcro strap, and adds a lot of protection from the sun to his car. Highly recommend!
B000BNZPT2|3|Its ok.
B00KZ0VEGE|5|It works as it is supposed to ! Save  money  by buying WD40 in bulk !
B001TNJ8SC|4|Easy install. Perfect for towing and heavy loading. Very satisfied!
B0032Y91B0|5|But if you plan on DIY on a 2002 Camry V6, don't, let the dealer do it. It'll be worth every penny.
B0002MSYEU|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M sandpaper.
B008YMTCNC|5|We use this to haul our 16 ft canoe in the 6 1/2 bed of a Ford F150 pick up. Easy to load and unload. Very sturdy. We have also used it to haul lumber. A handy hauler for a good price!
B0012ETJ1O|1|Defective product.  I bought two headlights in April to replace dimming 9 year old original Prius headlights.  Within 6 months, both new headlights had burned out (one in 3 months, one in 5 months).<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing.  I will not be buying Sylvania headlights again.
B00FM1CKK0|5|So super cute! It looks even better looking at it from the outside of the car. It is small, not gaudy, and I have to agree with other reviewers: elegant. I didn't think I would use this word until I saw it from the outside. Mine DID come with a chain, not a string, which I'm sure looks better. The chain is too long, so instead of clipping it to the desired length, I just wrapped the chain around the rear-view mirror a couple of times. Stays put without clipping.
B000C2UJNE|5|nice
B000EB423G|5|Love it works, great fits like a glove.
B00FGDEV9M|5|Fit, works!
B0089LSMSE|5|The items that arrived is as described.
B00SXE4GI2|5|Perfect fit for my '97 Lincoln Town Car. Very lightweight, but appears to be good quality material and well made.
B000CQTJPO|1|Extremely noisy. Had to purchase another set cuz it sounded like new brakes weren't even put on!!! So noisy I could still hear them while blasting Van Halen!!!100% crap
B007BXCKA2|5|Excellent product I plan on purchasing again in the near future, it is also the best filter for synthetic oils, I have used it for 15,000 miles and the oil was still clean and almost looked new, I used this with castrol edge and replaced one quart of oil with marvel mystery oil, and the results in my opinion were really good
B000C29AA2|5|They bear well.
B00PP79NAQ|5|These look so much better than nuts and bolts sticking out all summer.  I am not looking forward to putting the top back on this fall, but I am excited to see how well these work over the winter.
B0039MQ06Y|1|Bought this locally for about $9.  Fuel doesn't pour out.  I've filled and emptied it about a dozen times, and can't get it to empty decently.  Can't just remove the spout and use a funnel, since the fuel glugs out and all over the place.
B001BP2RFO|2|Wasn't what I suspected
B00029KC2K|5|Great product and very easy to install in tight places. Highly recommend the heat shield, order with confidence.
B00GBSGTE6|5|I love it except that its too big of a pouch, and im over 6 foot.
B008HRZPXU|3|Paint wears off fast
B00CD7EMKW|5|excellent
B00TE3ZF3G|5|Great product, looks nice, easy to install
B000K02EDG|5|After reviewing many forums & asking a few mechanic's I decided to go with the OEM knock sensors to be safe. Many people have said using aftermarket sensors has the check engine light go off and on & I like my vehicles to run in perfect condition so went with these sensors for my 2001 chevrolet 1500 HD I usually use OEM parts but wanted to be cheap lol the sensors I changed were the originals so I expect they'll last 15yrs like the ones before I traveled with at least 6,000 pounds behind me recently aprroximitly 300 miles passing decent grades & had no issue's I recommend
B008G32R9K|1|Absolute the cheapest of the cheap junk. Multiple parts of the lights crumbled apart upon removal from box. I guess it was scared at my looks. Thanks to Amazon for a total money back refund. Lesson learned. I will be buying a more well known brand or OEM next time. It will cost more but in this case you get what you pay for.
B00JR6JARW|4|Works fine ,I needed a long one, that I could bend a bit.
B0033RVGQO|5|the pipes look quality, I have yet to use them though but I'm they work fine.
B00KY3YRMK|2|I ordered this for my 2014 1794 Edition Tundra. It doesn't fit nearly as well as the same model that's made for my better-half's 2012 Camry. The one for the Camry is like it was made for it. This one, large gaps at the A-Pillar - like it's a good couple inches short on both sides. For it being &#34;custom fit&#34; I disagree, it's pretty universal for this one. Disappointed, but, it's still better than nothing. Especially since I had to wait several weeks for this one - ordered the one for the Camry while waiting for this one, have the one for the Camry arrive and fit so well.<br /><br />Funny thing is, as I was unfolding this in my truck the first time, a paper slipped out that read, more or less, don't expect a perfect fit. WTF did I order a &#34;custom fit&#34; and pay this much for it for?
B008YJ241W|4|Perfect
B001U7I0DG|5|Works better than anything I've tried.
B00RE6KV48|5|stuff works great
B009T97DEE|5|I'm old school, so I usually stick with OEM accessories on my cars...BUT, after reading the great reviews on these mats, I thought I would take a chance.<br />These are not your hard rubber looking floor mats you normally see, these almost look like they are made of kevlar (they're not).<br />I bought the complete set and they fit perfectly in my Range Rove Evoque.<br />Bottom line; I ended up saving $, these unique mats work great, and they look look fantastic!
B000CD56JA|5|Worked perfectly. Exact part I needed.
B007K2APQ0|1|ghese do not fit a 97 f250 as advertised
B001GJ9M9O|4|works
B004SSC4MM|5|Love it.  I used to always lose my keys now I wear them.  Buy it, for 7 bucks you won't regret it.
B00TP8FVK2|5|Awsome product. Came in fast and they work great
B00OVW03QE|5|Makes everything brighter and much crisper for the interior of your car. They are great  bulbs
B000S2QVYE|5|Cheaper and better than auto part store.
B00065L2D8|5|Nice Quality
B000CHLEM4|1|Not even close to fitting, cut it up and tossed it.
B00R3XTBNY|4|Small and bright. The wiring is a little thin (minus 1 star) but it is very easy to install with the bolts included. it is also suprisingly more bright then I thought it would be.
B00L9QY7KI|5|I just installed these in my 2012 Pilot.  They look awsome.  VERY classy.  Not as &#34;industrial&#34; looking as the Weathertech ones in my pick-up.  I hope they hold up well and are easy to clean because I really like they way they look.
B0031XULF2|4|I dont know how it would fare against a sawzal or sludge hammer but they are definitely a deterrent!
B0015PG5NU|5|Speaks for itself. Save some money and buy the kit. Laugh as other lube techs scratch there heads.
B0015KTWJE|5|good quality pipe.
B00D3S7N1K|4|Don't know where name dropping Honda comes into play as Yamaha has been licensing this engine from Lifan since the late '80's and is used on the XV250. First, on the Route 66 in 1988, then the Virago 250 and is still sold as the Star 250. It is a bulletproof engine that has proven itself time, and time, again over the years and from what I can see it hasn't changed a bit in over 25 years. Has a flat, wide torque band for what it is.
B00C7Y2AAK|5|great original product for Mazda Cars
B009LOZPY2|5|Visor fit perfectly. The color matched. Very easy to install. The visor no longer falls down continuously.
B00VNBEFZ6|5|I purchased the OPT7 led conversation kit for my 2002 Ford F-150 which has aftermarket halo headlights. The overall build quality is phenomenal, and the packaging is very neat and clean.  They were very easy to install and they are much better than the stock halogens. I was very impressed with OPT7 for they're build quality in an industry where lots of  aftermarket lights are cheaply made. I was so impressed I went back and ordered some led pods as well. Overall great people great product.
B00ISA3FA6|5|Very sturdy.  Welded it to the frame.  It's very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.  Plenty of room for a winch.
B002XA4PLA|5|on time priced right and very durable much better than bumper stickers
B000N5LJCU|5|I have a Infiniti G35X and the exhaust fit perfectly and sounds great.
B001C6NC7O|5|FAST SHIPPING, BOUGHT FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVED IT
B00JIIZCM6|5|This product worked very well on my leather purse and my leather car seat.  I was able to get a lot of the denim dye from my jeans off of both my yellow, leather purse as well the cream-colored seat of my car.  Just spray onto the cloth that comes with the product and wipe.  Almost all of the dye from the car seat came off, but this is only because I did not continue to wipe it as much as I could have.  I was not as successful in getting all of the dye off of my purse; however, this was not because of the leather cleaner.  I realized that I may have ruined my chances of removing all of the dye when I had previously (and foolishly) used a wet wipe to clean the purse.  I'm sure that if you use only this product with the accompanying cloth, you will likely be able to get rid of most of your stains.
B004A4XCWA|5|IT WORK GREAT FOR MY 1999 PASSAT
B002L1PFWO|5|Looks to be the updated model that is fool proof to install.  Installed in 2 minutes.  Push in and give 1/4 twist to the right to lock in.
B00AV9NBY2|4|All the other comments are right about the mounting holes being wrong, / I had to drill new (Bottom Holes ) so it would be level, Instead of sticking up in the air, Once I got it re-drilled and Installed, I like it
B001INN62M|5|Perfect
B00EEEB77I|5|Love it when the rain comes down just enough to make it dirty, usually right after I get a car wash.<br /><br />Being cheap, I had to rinse down 2 cars thanks to dirty rain.  I happen to have this chamois as well as its more famous yellow counterpart.  This one works equally as good, but about 60% cheaper.  They do work great, you can scrub hard with these on the little specks of bird droppings and they won't scratch your car paint.  Next time I need one of these, definitely buying this one.
B00KTIURMO|2|Stopped working one week after I bought it. A battery change didn't fix three problem.
B002E30O9S|4|Perfect... thanks
B005CLLBDC|4|good
B00LV2L58W|2|I don't know how the seller claims they are anodized black, they arrived plain old oxidized raw aluminum. They work and for the price value is there but pretty they aren't.
B00B4KTH90|5|Great!
B004TDMVA6|5|Have always had good luck buying Delco Rotors, good quality and durable.
B0002L6OS4|5|Great product, perfect fit, fast delivery.
B000AUMM1A|4|Picked these up for my high beams. Shipping was pretty quick. Got them in about a week. Like one of the other reviews mentioned the color is a very nice shade of yellow. Very bright. Looks. Great so far. Came out better than expected for the price. Leaves a nice yellow tint around the high beam assembly when looked at the right angles. I would recommend. Will update on quality as I put it to more use.
B00U868BN4|1|Product is cheaply made for the money and was already broken when shipped.
B0030GD9JA|5|Perfect fit
B00651C998|2|Signal was too degraded, I went with a shorter antenna that extends and it works great.  TR-D Carbon 4.5&#34; Adjustable.
B00JJYPATO|5|The driver side of my front bumper was hanging due to someone hitting my car a few months ago. These quick release fasteners fixed it like a charm.
B00FQW7V4U|4|Loved how it came with two free stickers!! It was simple to apply, just a tad bit tedious but nothing too hard! I just adore seeing my tree as I walk to my car! ☺️
B0002UHVAA|4|This think works! I like being able to back-flush several times until the liquid coming out is clear.  Then I know the tank is clean.
B00K56PSI8|5|My daughter in law loved it!
B000C9MA2A|4|Ordered a bunch of AC Delco Pro. Replacement Parts for my steering system. All work well, seem sturdy, installed properly, and have proper ball joint rubber caps. Only complaint was the factory grease- half the parts had next to jone, the other half had none. Take advantage of the grease points and push out the stock crap for some decent grease.
B00XZNKLEE|4|Doesn't quite fit the buttons on the fob. Specifically where the starter button is. Great finish though! Looks very clean.
B007CLNIJK|5|Fit perfectly
B000I1EEXA|5|works great for my lph 400 awata paint gun
B00PW30ZPU|5|The 4 elastic tie down clips work well, too. The cover stays put. For the price it really is top notch. It saves me 15 minutes each morning from defrosting windows, nice!
B0097CDJLE|5|Works great
B00AOA7ZO0|4|Why not passengers van?
B00IKJDMW6|3|These may be OK for an inexpensive brake job on a car that is getting older and may need replacement soon. I am on a very tight budget at the moment. I need to economize where possible. I guess it is questionable if I should economize on Brakes, but the front disc brakes are the ones that do most of the work.<br />These will probably serve the purpose. If you want &#34;quality&#34; you will most likely have to spend more.<br />My rear brake drums are rusting. I actually sanded and painted the areas with Rustoleum, that don't come in contact with the brake shoes. Thy still continued to rust. They were &#34;turned&#34; once by my mechanic. My idea was to just replace them this time around.<br />I have factory mag wheels on my car. Areas of the brake drums are visible. That doesn't look particularly nice when you see rusty drums beyond the mag wheels.<br />I actually painted all of the areas on these new drums, that don't come in contact with the brake shoes. The idea was to prevent rust before it starts. This is pretty much an effort in futility.<br />These drums are molded in a &#34;rough&#34; casting then machined ONLY on the areas needed in order to be smooth. The remainder is very rough metal. When painted, they look like someone painted over very rusty metal. So the actual look isn't too much different than I have now.<br />When I painted these I left them outside to dry. Over night, a light rain came up and they got wet. ALL metal that was not covered by paint was already showing rust. Bottom line these are very cheap iron, that will rust quickly. Remember, brake drums DO get wet under normal driving conditions. If you are in a colder climate, road salt will cause much quicker rust.<br />ALL brake drums will rust. How quickly and to what degree is the real issue. Obviously in the case of these, it will be VERY quick.<br />Now hopefully the areas I painted wont rust for a while. Brake shoes wear away any film of rust that occurs but only on the inside and the area they contact. Brakes DO heat up from friction. This helps dry any moisture that accumulates. That is mainly why the drums last as long as they do. Again, my paint will hopefully help. The main issue of rust is that it tends to build up in areas right next to where the brake shoe contacts. Over time, this can wear into the areas of the shoes themselves. This may cause uneven wear of the shoes. Rust may also cause difficulty on removing the drums in the future.<br />If I knew then what I know now, I would have chosen a better drum. I DID in fact chose upgraded rotors and pads for the front. If these show too much deterioration in the future, I may replace them sooner than is needed depending on the brake shoe wear.<br /><br />This is a case of getting what you pay for. If you plan on getting ride of the car in a foreseeable future, these will probably be adequate. If you want something that will last as long as the OEM drums, get something better.
B008G329DO|5|looks great, perfect fit.
B00UW1T31Y|4|It fits and for a VERY good price. How long it lasts is yet to be seen. Original lasted about 150,000 miles. if it lasts well I'll change it to five stars.
B00PUOQRK8|5|Ok, to be honest. I was more frustrated that I didn't think to cut up wet suit material and turn them into seat covers but that said, the workout smell I had in my car has all but been eliminated. I'm happy, my wife's happy and this simple product saved my fun little car. Yes I work out. Yes I sweat, Yes I love my car and yes I use them everyday. If you're like me, this is money well spent!!
B004EDFF90|5|Very nice
B00GBVHPNW|3|Comfy and light. Palm material is durable enough, but has a weird dotted grip surface. The material around cuff on the other hand is not that durable, light, and rips easily. Be careful pulling them on.
B0002Z9QY4|5|Did I not already write this review??  Even if I did, this is an update after having them on the car for almost 20 months now.  After being driven through the desert, hitting them with blazing heat/UV at over 10000' for days at a time, living at almost 6000' through 15F winters, the blades might need to be replaced.  I am trying to clean them to rejuvenate them.  But wow, so much better under these conditions than the junk I had been struggling with from the local auto shops.  I'm sold, gonna buy them again.
B0052SF0LO|5|nice
B00PYCXGSM|5|Works great
B010N7RW2S|5|Fast shipping. I had an issue with this particular model but my replacement which was a different model than this one works like a charm. I believe on average, i can get about 15 jumps on 1 full charge. Customer service from this seller is amazing.
B0090B7M2O|5|saved me from the stealership..
B00S9OM0C0|4|I ordered two of these. They quality is inconsistent. One came with the bow barely hanging on, all the bling in-tact, but no additional little rhinestones in a baggie. The other one came with a bow solidly glued on, a missing rhinestones, but a baggie of additional rhinestones. So, how they package it is inconsistent as well as the gluing on of the bow. I had to buy superglue to set the bow myself as well as the one tiny little rhinestone. They are exactly the same though. The color and appearance is just like the pictures online -- super adorable! I can't wait to put it on my car. I hope they hold up through driving. I will try to remember to update this. I'm a city driver mostly, though, averaging 27 mph in the city. ;-)<br />EDIT: You'll see in the picture of the back of my car, I removed the bow and superglued it to the bottom middle. Thankfully, the box had extra rhinestones to fill the blank spot. On the front, I had to install it upside down. In addition, the little tabs on the back that hold the license plate in place are TOO short. I had to take pliers to bend the entire frame to hold the license plate better. It won't be an issue if you can use 4 screws per plate, but I wasn't able to.
B0062IJOJ2|1|Did not fit my ranger at, all i order is for my ranger, sent me ones fitting a chevy, Never did i say i have a chevy, always for a ford ranger
B00FYHKC5C|4|Bumper perfect, but no clips included like advertised. I just used the originals. otherwise 5 stars.
B000IEAWN8|3|-Excellent for monitoring system information.<br />-Easy to install.  Took 30 minutes (I read the manual and had a beer).<br />-MPG actually decreased when set to transmission (Preset one) only from stock.  Preset two is excellent for towing and hauling.  i haven't tried preset 3.
B00MEVO5U4|5|These are too cute.  They are a little bigger than i expected.  But I really like them!!
B00SWJ391S|5|Excellent product. And look flashy on my Electra Cruiser bicycle.
B00HWGX04I|2|They fit on the metal lever and work but they have to be manually pushed down. This is a hassle.
B00FCG1B6Y|5|I didn't know if I would ever feel comfortable with a seat belt on it the car again.  This is perfect!  Such a simple solution and I don't feel like I'm being strangled to death in my car anymore.
B00029JMXA|3|Very cool looking on the car, but poor quality in general.  Vibrates too much because it is too light weight
B000VAXN5S|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B008OIGAZY|3|The wheel cover was a challenge to put on. Once I got it on I noticed that the seams are already coming apart, so I don't expect it to last long at all.
B00COYNZJ8|4|Blocks the sun. It's funny, sometimes embarrassing.
B00COE3Z8E|5|Great wiper
B0017OFS3C|5|5 stars
B000QUZ572|5|Perfect fit. Great price. Would buy again
B0013TM0Z0|2|The plastic clips broke when installing the heater to the mounting bracket
B00P9RYBK4|5|Finally had the opportunity to use this pump and it is perfect for my application. I have a boat in a slip with no gas facilities nearby so I transport same in an elongated approved gasoline container. As my container is shallow, I adapted a shorter suction pipe to it, works like a charm. BTW, the wiring required was a simple task.
B008S79R9M|5|Cute and sturdy. Doesn't help me find my vehicle though like I'd hoped, it's kind of small to find in a large parking lot. But still very cute!
B005450HCW|5|Have had this on my Tenere for 2or3 years now,works great I'm 6'3&#34; keeps air flow smooth, most days it's parked in the sun at work and hasn't had any negative effects on it. Looks great with more protection than the stocker.
B007137D2W|5|Great product. Came on time
B002303TZ8|5|This is a great alternative to the more pricey spring kits.  I installed it in my Roadstar and it works perfectly and has a good feel at the clutch lever.  I am very pleased.
B00FUWQR1O|5|Great!! They fit my 2013 F-150 perfectly!!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Jumbo Size, approx 57” x 30” only $14.97. Comes with storage pouch. Excellent value!  Fits my new vehicle perfectly. Covers every inch of windshield area, especially around the mirror where many similar products allow a gap to let light/heat in.Folds very compact. It is a bit difficult & time consuming  to get back into the pouch though. Not sure I will use the pouch daly. I will use the sunshade every day.<br />Highly recommended.
B00W6J1570|1|Spend a little more for a better quality product.  Driver's side piece cracked after 3 days.
B004GESL16|5|Excellent. Fit my 2003 Toyota Solara perfectly. This is what I was looking for. Recommended.
B00008RW9V|4|Not bad, my wife use it to remove dust from different electronics system.
B000CGP13I|1|Just as the warning says. Brake pads look premium though. Can't return as I live overseas
B007RYMT7O|4|Installed very easy, still a little noisy but water pressure back to where it should be.
B004HYRIBE|5|Fits like a glove to my truck and what a looks improvemenrt !
B00HE0K9LO|5|This bug and stone deflector fits the 2015 Toyota RAV4 perfectly.  A lot less expensive than the WeatherTech product too.
B00BTGSID0|5|They are aptly named. These things are FAT and thirsty. They ones I received are more of a neon yellow and they literally look like they are glowing against black paint. So much better than the no name microfiber towels from the box stores. Love all my Chemical Guys stuff so far.
B00U5I75NW|5|Excellent for a Tacoma 2001
B00062YMJW|4|Fit nicely! I like it!
B00IZR6DKG|5|this is a great spark plug.  what a good day.
B00F6BBY8A|5|Love them
B003SZQHZ6|5|Finally after three tries found a seller who knows what they are doing! This light fits perfectly on the 2002 GMC 1500 extended cab SLT. The others I bought did not, the attachment plate was tilted to the side. This one is straight across. thank you!
B00O83OBQY|2|Wrong wiring harness, not even close to being able to plug into factory harness.
B000COCTXA|4|Very quick to change these out! Took 5 minutes or so to change then adjust.
B006K8MBU8|1|This tubing was mislabeled, it was not 304 stainless steel. I checked the material with Niton PMI testing equipment, analyzer could not identify material but did reveal a the exterior surface to contain 62% Zinc. Because the material was also magnetic it would lead me to believe it is  zinc plated steel tubing.
B000LOGQ26|5|These things make it much easier to link in and out for my Sunfish trailer.  I'm not sure I would use them on much more than that, though.  But then, that's what I got them for.
B00W63X0LA|5|Purchased these to remind myself to unplug the battery charger on the car since its plugged in the back and I don't drive it often.  I place this on the key fob as a reminder I need to unplug it.  So far. it's worked well.
B008VLVDII|4|A must for hubby's truck
B00BNVJZPQ|5|great product for your Mazda Car, get the best not the rest
B00HSRY2Z2|5|Perfect fit on the Cycra Probends with the new logo design!
B00MXLRXE0|5|awesome
B008OK2ESE|5|Put this on my f350 to prevent scratches from boot marks working good so far.
B0007RQXDE|5|This is really good stuff... better than any other leather conditioner that I've used. Smells good too!
B003EP52BU|5|No more scuffed door sills for me. Very easy installation when you follow the instructions and it stays forever, well for me it is two years. Oh, just remember to touch paint your sill before application of the protector.
B005LRT80U|5|A+:  Fast delivery, and item as described.  I would order from them again.
B001GJ7H9G|5|Love it, gentle on the paint
B000VU98GG|2|Really flimsy.  Not worth the price.  Came bent.  Returned.  I will make my own.
B0013JVZ7O|1|wouldn't work
B00TENKG4Y|5|Absolutely love these for 2015 Jeep Wrangler. They look great. Came in with a paint chip on one but easily touched up.
B000C57NE4|5|Perfect for what I need.
B00K0OFSUS|5|Solid. Make sure you securely bolt all mounting positions. Some re-drilling/ modification required to fit. I get a lot of compliments on this bumper/ hitch/ step.
B00CD2R7A4|5|Love them!!! Just as described
B00NJRGD70|5|I am pleased with the sun shade.
B00FSBE7MI|5|Love it!
B00804HWOU|5|Absolutely fantastic. Where has this tool been all my life? It's unbelievable how easy this tool makes it to COMPLETELY refill your coolant (i.e. no air pockets). Amazing....simply amazing. I'm one happy customer.
B00B2LCE1E|5|Worked like a charm for my 2010 Chevy Cobalt! Changed it out and my check engine light is now off! I changed this one and the other one next to it. I'm not a big car person so I found out about this part while watching YouTube videos. Code P0013 is the code that kept on popping up. No problems since changing this. Day 2 now!
B00LGHGE2E|1|These things are big. 1.25 dia. 2 inches long. They won't work on my bike (2011 650R) with my exhaust. If the exhaust were stock they would boly on, but I don't think they would relly look right.
B000OEDQQW|5|I cannot tell you how long I have been searching walmart, grocery stores and target looking for a razorblade like this. My husband finally said, have you checked Amazon.... I, a compulsive Amazon shopper, surprisingly had not. I love this scraper and I love how it is not hollow all the way up the handle, reducing germ and bacteria growth in unseen places. I use razor blades for cleaning so I feel like they are always dirty and gross. This one is easy to clean and easy to change blades and has a nice grip.
B00O4D13ZU|3|FYI the pictures attached show two different covers. Even though the description does not say it, this is the BackFlip VP cover which is the smooth seamless one shown in the top picture. The second picture shows the seams and is clearly a different cover most likely the backflip G2
B00GSAUHB8|5|Five starts for the protector, but I would not say I love it.  I need a slightly larger one, but this one works very well.
B009IFIQYU|5|This snapped right in my 2009 f-150 just remember to put in your 2 little pressure clips from your old mirror so it doesn't vibrate
B00F0VQBKC|5|Love this filter!  Porsche is amazing and has GREAT cars, but they also do some things that are not perfect.  One of them is a plastic filter surround that only filters 70% of the oil at best.  Plastic can crack if struck.  Not a great thing to have on the bottom of your LOW car.  This filter provides 100% filtration and the filters are readily available for 25% of the cost of Porsche's inferior filters right here on Amazon.  This high quality metal design will add about 1 lb max of weight.  I just drank a 16 oz beer that weighs that much....so not a weight issue.  This filter will go a long ways in protecting your investment.  Also, look at using Joe Gibbs DT40 oil and NOT the paid recommendation of Mobil 0-40.  It is a way better oil for your car.  Cheers!
B00GNU3HAG|1|This item will most likely not fit in your classic car.  The back of the light has a very large weather seal and it is not shaped like a stock headlight.  Only buy this light if you are willing to take a SawsAll to the headlight bracket of your classic car and do major fabrication and wiring work.  If you find out that it won't fit, do not expect Octane Lighting to own the fact that they misrepresent what vehicles the lights will fit.  They expect you to pay for their mistake, and pay shipping both ways.  Poor product, poor company.  Pass on these guys.
B00873J0YY|5|Sure you can buy an easier to load and attach model from Thule or Yakima and they probably are a bit stronger BUT this was $60 not $400.  Considering we are new to kayaking and spent a total of $500 on 2 kayaks, paddles and PFD's the price of a Thule rack was out of the question.  They attached to my son's Subaru Forester factory mounted load bars and will also fit older Thule square load bars as well.  They work and they look good.  This was money well spent!!
B004SRK4HK|5|Replaced my burnt out alternator. Fit perfect in my 94 wrangler. No problems so far. For the price can't beat it.<br /><br />On a side note, being a new alternator I was surprised with the packaging. Of course amazon put it in another box, however the original alternator box was completely torn up.. It had several holes in it and the top was almost completely ripped off. Makes me wonder if the alternator is actually new or not.
B0055DP5AW|3|Love these, once you get them mounted good fit.
B00II99ORU|1|Weak light, and they flicker, no bueno
B008OY8RMW|4|They get the job done, but they are made out of pressed sheet metal and had some sharp edges in the loop holes.
B00PUDVFT2|1|2 weeks and 200 miles after installation 6 or the 8 burned through. Will be returning.
B009SI2SQ4|4|I have yet to install this and was a bit disappointed in the lack of wiring connections for installation. The 3 wires are marked to distinguish each other but no instructions as to which is connected to what. I finally used a 9v battery and experimented until I found the right connections to use. Unit looks solid and durable. Light display appears to be bright. I will be connecting mine to the flashing unit sold here as well. (GS-100A LED Brake stop lite flasher).
B004K23KQ0|4|This step/recovery point is a beast. I love it. This is a very heavy solid metal step. It is obvious this will stand up very well to abuse.<br /><br />My only complaint is how loose this fits in the receiver. I had to wrap it in several layers of electrical tape to keep it from rattling around too much.
B00AW1AG38|5|Much easier fit than the one piece style
B012CKJ6TG|5|Works Great! Super BRIGHT! It's amazing! Great stuff! Highly Recommend!<br />*Product purchased at a discount
B00J0DRNZS|5|Perfect fit for my 02 my ac works again
B00UZHVKM0|5|Mirrors are a excellent up grade
B00PUY6FOQ|5|No more old man antennas on my new cvo roadglide.
B00M8UDCCS|4|It has two  screens dark and clear for night, you can open it just pushing a button it fits perfect. The only complain about is the tie it could be easier like the click ones. But excellent everything else.
B00F4B1WGG|4|Adds a classy look to your Tacoma for sure compared to the stock.  It's sturdy and has an easy application process.  It's not going anywhere.  It's more of a matte finish compared to the more chrome look here.  That's confusing considering it's a genuine Toyota part and all other exterior metal is a shiny chrome.  Also, the bolt mechanism is bulky and easily shows.  All in all it was worth the purchase as I have no desire for an after market or TRD exhaust.
B00XZ9OORI|1|Wasn't what I expected. Need another working fob to make this work
B00UW0HFXS|3|did not fit the hitch as expected
B000GU3KEC|5|Kept it on for a week after I washed the bike; took it off, spotless. Worth every penny. Excellent cover. Can't wait to test it in rain.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Great light has really good construction has been submerged in mud and no leaks and really bright
B00RER8WDE|5|Another great Acerbis product & perfect fit for my KTM.
B007IA1ZX6|5|Worked well on our 2004 Trail Bazer
B000AM8BLI|5|5 stars
B00877SL2M|3|These are very bright white lamps for use in various auto applications.  The problem with them is they are polarity sensitive and there is no marking as to which pin should be positive.  It an easy technology fix to add a bridge rectifier and then the polarity would not matter, however, the light should at least be marked which lead goes to positive.  So, they are just &#34;ok&#34;.
B00RW7WNF4|5|After I figured out how to remove the old blades, lol, installing the new ones was a piece of cake! Just be sure to slide off the yellow blade protectors.
B004GR5DK0|5|Fit like it was suppose to on my 2003 Suzuki quad. Good quality chain and sprockets for the price.
B00JKUOHIW|5|Fit well in the car
B0025X60EA|4|A little larger than expected
B000VDYY1M|3|I like it but eventually the material wears off.
B000EDOSUG|5|Perfect for adding counter space in your camper.  We love it!
B005NLCGF8|5|Works Great....Did exactly what I needed it to do.
B000BQW5LK|5|Should have bought this thing before trying to refill the transfer case with gear oil, I ended up making a mess and had a hard time getting the job done.
B00L4G4XWA|5|Work great thank you! Sturdy, affordable and worth every penny!
B00JH6M0TM|1|I t came defected and I received a replacement ballast as I thought would solve the problem. It did not solve the problem. The 12v 40a CY replay switch is buzzing.
B000NSBSNW|5|Fits well. Had to get longer screws.
B0091Q3NCG|5|Great value!
B0002LBKDS|5|The only product I use on my GTR's wheels.  MAGIC!
B000I2079E|3|might update the review if this thing actually works, but so far, the screw does not want to loosen up.
B0002U2V1Y|4|Definitely one of the better clay bars that I've used.  Took off a lot of paint transfer, swirls​, fish eyes, and other issues I was having.  I would highly recommend claying your vehicle before waxing it.  The difference in shine and luster is substantial when you do that.  As far as the microfiber or spray bottle of &#34;Instant Detailer&#34; goes, you can pretty much chuck those in the garbage.  You are definitely buying this kit for the clay.
B00FS2TL3C|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00C2U6BAE|5|Cute product
B0087Y9SP4|5|What a deal on these switches.  Used them on my central vac.
B00029JXOI|5|Very nice compact unit,easy installation and very reliable, would recommend this product.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This Cargo Bag is AWESOME. I bought it prior to traveling across the country from South Carolina to Utah, where I encountered multiple TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS. I thought that my stuff was soaked for good. Good thing that I only put in things that I wouldn't mind getting wet, but turns out all of my things were BONE DRY when I opened it! I was shocked, especially since I had the cargo bag on top for a solid two weeks while backpacking, camping, hiking, and giving a beating to say the least. I think the biggest factor that played into all of my things remaining dry was because I wasn't opening and closing it during the trip. My suggestion would be to store all of the materials that you don't need immediate access to until you reach your destination. AWESOME BAG - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
B007GR4LIC|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0009N0W60|5|Love it
B000GOHV48|5|Awesome... Just what the doctor ordered...
B000NSB8LE|5|Perfect fit.
B002H5I17A|5|Best price on a BHAF for my Cummins that I could find anywhere. This filter seems to flow much better than stock, just attach it to the end of your turbo inlet hose.
B000GBBP8O|4|Works well and a very easy installation.
B00WED0X0I|4|Works as advertised, we suction-cup them to the side of the camper and slide in an American flag, Navy flag and Christian flag.  Hold well, works good.
B00HV1VDFM|5|Product is very nice and customer service is great.
B00651CLVE|2|Lost reception, comparing to factory antenna.
B003VARJVE|1|We used this product exactly as directed on the label,  rinsed the rv off immediately as directed, and went a step further and washed the rv with cleaner after rinsing to prevent white streaks.  All the precautions we took to prevent terrible streaking did not help and this product does not clean any better than the other products we have used.  We will go back to using the 2 part cleaner and conditioner.  We clean and condition the roof monthly so our roof stays in good shape but this one step product caused more work than the 2 part products.  Save yourself money, time and hard work and don't use this product!
B000EQLCTI|5|Fit my '03 wrangler as expected. Filter looks OEM quality. Included gasket felt like a rubber-integrated fiber and seemed solid enough, but since the dealership used RTV I put some in the pan side of the gasket just to be safe. Would definitely buy again.
B00NLRIPV0|5|Know what helmet size you need before buying! I knew already the helmet size I needed thankfully.  Beyond that this is an excellent helmet and a really stunning design as well! I do love everything about this helmet so far!  I am truly satisfied with it!
B00HAR8XLO|3|does the job
B007I6K4I2|5|Works as it should!!
B006GJKHTI|5|Awesome product
B001G7TV38|5|received promptly and as advertised
B000C2WKOU|5|Fit right in
B0022XSKUA|3|The kit is o.k. The pan portion of the kit is well designed. Instructions that came with the kit are a little vague, but not impossible to decode. Definitely cleans up the rear of my Speed Triple nicely. The turn signals included with the kit are junk. One of the turn signals had a short in the housing. Contacted seller about a single replacement. Wanted me to send entire kit back. Not exactly convenient. I was able to 'engineer' a fix until I receive turn signals from a different seller
B00YCXSYQS|4|These are super absorbent and do the job.  The directions say they are machine washable and not to put them in the dryer.  Well - I put them in the dryer and they shrunk to like like half their original size.  I can still use them - just a word of caution if you are not careful with wash instructions.
B00QKT5AI2|5|Excellent
B00N9SEO2K|1|This shoe is really stiff. Not conducive for motorcycle riding.
B005JV7VL6|4|The fit on this helmet is ok. It sits pretty high on your head, but is comfortable and at a good price for a SA approved helmet. Fit is true to size and seems to be the same as the sparco for much less! Please click the helpful button if you found this review informative and helpful. Thanks!
B00JW4O9FC|5|awesome
B000KZ0Q7W|5|This couldn't have been easier to program and they are still working after a year of multiple daily uses.
B00LWDVMTC|1|Be very careful when purchasing this.  I purchased it for a 2007 Drive Electric.  If you have an electric cart, IT WILL NOT FIT!  Any, and I mean ANY, electrical wiring (from the shifter, to a horn, to the key, a cigarette lighter) will interfere with the insert.  My insert also did NOT sit correctly (just the top piece).  I am sending it back and I am very disappointed.  It may work fine on a gas cart, but not an electric.
B003NAQTZO|4|Product is everything it was said to be. Works great. The only problem I have with it was the shipping. It took them a week before they finaly shipped.
B009Q76CAK|4|Decent for a cheap hose but be aware that there are no swivels on the fittings
B00CJ36DYI|5|As described and fast shipping
B003BZCZZE|5|nice
B001EOV492|5|Works great.
B00F9YGM4U|5|Great product- had it for a while now and it's holding up just great.  Super solid, I recommend this truck rack.
B001EYFN94|5|Just as described works  perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends
B00029K21G|3|There needs to be a better way to tell if this will work with a specific vehicle. I am sure they will work fine on some vehicles but not on a 1990 Ford E150
B00B32DD5S|5|great product. fast service. work well.
B000BZWZLQ|3|I dont know why but didnt fit in my Durango 2003 4x4 Sport 4.7 Lt
B0063RL8CI|3|None of these fit my 2008 toyota tundra they shipped fast and would have been great if they would have fit.
B00B2BS6DE|1|Is this carpet 3rd row seating as well?
B00WH1ZC80|5|Love these.  Finally, a place where my three-year olds can hang their backpacks and still be able to reach them.  No more, &#34;Mom, can you get ____ out of my backpack?&#34; all the way home from school.  No more worries about their bags sliding off of the center console between their seats if I have to brake suddenly.  Also, one of my boys likes to break everything, or see if he can, anyway.  So the first day this hook was up, he noticed it, but not until after I had already put him in his carseat.  The second day, however, he was able to take it off of the seat in front of him before I realized he had it.  We were driving on the expressway before I realized he had it.  And, true to form, he was trying to break it.  It stood up to him doing his worst to it for forty miles.  Love these things.  Wish I'd bought them a year ago. :)
B004C6OBBC|5|Very good
B00KIZPFPM|3|Kinks easily and a little tight on the ID for press fittings. Steel bands make it difficult to cut.
B00C4XFMO0|5|Works great.
B00JSYJ31G|1|Would give zero if possible, you will never get the camber it says you will without cutting out pieces of your inner fender wall because they don't actually fit! Comes out to almost a half inch too long with new camber links and I didn't even bother measuring it with the stock links seeing as they still slammed on the fender wall. As it sits the most we have been able to get out of it is positive camber only.
B00DY78RWY|1|I drive for a living. After about 1 hour of sitting on it, my back started to hurt. By the end of my work shift, my back was in severe pain. The bars/grooves do not make this comfortable. I am returning it.
B001XUD46S|5|Great quality, easy to install, and added a nice look to the truck.
B00029JE1U|4|These should come with a chart to know which colors do what to displacement of accelerator pump.<br />Had to find resources on web so knew which color to try next to resolve a flat spot on my Holley.<br />Trying blue next over my stock white. If you search the web there is a resource that shows how many cc they put out, and the pattern at a specific throttle position.  This should be included with purchase...<br />Colors are off, had to read some of the numbers to know which was which, not all numbered either...
B0017OCGZK|4|Very bright white light lets me see at dusk while trying to finish lawn before dark!
B0036PS332|4|They were cool
B00S4HHVLW|5|Worked just the way I hoped it would.
B0018YIK0O|5|Best shocks I ever had nice and stiff on my 2000 Cadillac escalade
B004SFKJIQ|5|Saw some reviews that it was difficult to empty and clean but we found it very easy to take apart and empty and clean when we were done. We needed to use it during a major plumbing job that left us without the use of our bathrooms for a few days. My wife and I highly recommend it.
B00CNI1SDA|1|[[ASIN:B00CNI1SDA Leather Afterlife Leather Conditioner - The Best Leather Conditioner & Restorer for Cars, Furniture, Boots, Saddles, Purses & More 8 oz]]This product did not make a bit of difference on my leather seats. It looks great when first applied, but once it dries, there is no difference. The seats looked even drier than before, I tried on a pair of leather Shoes, again same results. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this product.
B00IV1U9ZG|1|I asked for all 3 of the trailer locks to be keyed the same - the only reason that we were buying new door locks was so that we didn't have to carry so many keys...I put &#34;Please key all 3 locks the same&#34;...we're getting ready to leave for 9 days...locks came and are NOT keyed the same, each lock has a different key.  I'm extremely frustrated and very disappointed!
B007ISGL0U|5|Has a noticeable difference in performance in a 2015 Scion Tc, it's gas mileage improvement isn't noticeable however. Huge difference in the sound and the throttle feels more responsive as well. As for installation it's a breeze, the instructions are clear and it provides step by step pictures as well. Great brand and product.
B00757KJTI|3|I like the look and feel to the antenna.  I don't really know how well the antenna works. I don't listen to the radio, but needed to replace it since it was hitting my garage.  I did test it out, but I could still get reception with or without an antenna.  I did notice that there was a lose of reception in the parking garage.  If you need one for better or equal reception,  this isn't the antenna for you.
B00496RE82|5|Worked just like it is supposed to.  By the way:  Ethanol Gas is CRAP.  IT HAS RUINED 3 OF OUR OLDER CARS FUEL SYSTEMS NOW.  That crap turns into a molasses gooey mess in about 6 months, and it eats rubber, carb seals, etc.<br /><br />  I don't care how much the government tries to cram this crap down our gas tanks, it is not safe for older vehicles.  We even hear national radio ads that say using ethanol gas in outdoor equipment is against the law!!!!!  Yet, it is still sold to the public.<br />BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU PULL UP TO THE GAS PUMP IN YOUR OLDER VEHICLES&#62;<br />We get better gas mileage with NON-ethanol premium gas, and our fuel pumps have lasted a lot longer too even in our 2006 Denali.  3 to 4 more miles per gallon.
B001G7TY2G|5|works perfectly.
B00JTUBP6U|5|great product.  use in all my cars
B003RNWOAQ|4|Says its tire sensor safe, hopefully will never have to use. Wish i had this kit, the four times nails got in my tires in the past. :-(<br />Must have for every car, will buy one for my lil sis.
B0016IJVQY|5|Although this was not the least expensive price found on the Internet Amazon provided the fastest delivery and track ability of any provider of this product. I am satisfied with my purchase and ease of installation. I definitely recommend and will use Amazon for further purcases.
B00F8O9ESC|5|VERY well made, if pricey.  Looks great as well.
B002OAXAE2|5|This tank bib is beautiful. It is a perfect match for my mustang seats.
B001OE2842|5|I'm very happy with mine. Looks great!
B005QVZXFU|4|fit and worked great
B00XCANO4O|5|I've been looking for a good tire gauge to use on my 1 ton dually truck, but most gauges I've found won't cover the pressures that I need or they don't have the right angle to fit the tandem axle tire setups.  I ran across this tire gauge from TireTek that goes from 0-160 psi and has the 2-way angled tip that is necessary to read the inside tires.  It appears to be made from a solid heavy duty steel that is chrome plated.  I like the fact that it has a rubber protector around the base of the guage in case it gets dropped so that it won't damage the guage, however, it can be easily removed for those who may not like it.  Pretty thoughtful!  I also like the fact that it has a built in pressure release valve and holds the pressure that I read.  The Schrader valve tip also turns around 360 degrees so that it can get the angle that I need to read the pressure on the inner tires of my truck which are hard to get to.  The readings are accurate when compared to other guages that I have access to, and this gauge is 2&#34; in diameter so I don't have any problems trying to read the pressures.  The gauge is advertised as meeting the ANSI B40.1 Grade B accuracy standards. Overall, I think that this guage will last me for a long time and would recommend it to others.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.
B00384SKC0|5|Good product.
B000B6CVZU|5|Perfect fit, feels a lot more well made than the original. Only downside is it has a car on it instead of a truck but no biggie!
B00KUBKUQ8|5|Used on my R6 street fighter! Works good and holds up well!
B00QJPB6PI|5|Strong and not noticeable  or in the way.
B00ORLLJQC|1|Did not fit 2001 Golf key fob. Batteries were different sizes, the chip interfered with the battery holder, wouldn't clip together..
B003ZWKCVW|5|EXCELLENT!
B00H1ES6S6|4|Bulbs look solid and they all worked - no dead LEDs.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, they will will not work for 2015 Honda Accord Sedan for map lights or license plate lights. They're about 0.1 to 0.2 inches too long.
B001NAUAXI|5|much nicer than oem filter and much easier to get on and off with a normal socket wrench.
B00ZS9S1LS|5|Its on my car!
B000QFN3DU|4|Not very sticky adhesive and not very flexible for wrapping things like hoses.
B00LOZCBU2|5|MD Pride perfect!
B00CLDXGNC|4|Bought this for the passengers seat in my 97 Chevy conversion van.  Looks and fits right smartly.  I mount the top underneath the headrest. Tie it off on both sides around the head rest then push the head rest down on top of the beads. This way the beaded seat cover fits over the edge of the front of the seat.  Works great.
B000RXKR6M|5|good material and holds a lot of liquid.
B00MY3BVOU|1|Advertised as premium, but are actually made in China
B00Y1HSDGG|5|Easy Ordering Received items as smooth as advertised. Good Instructions. Thanks
B00V9XGQ5U|5|This is a really great trunk organizer. It folds up to a small and easily portable size when you're not using it, and when you are using it, it's big enough to fit anything that you'd need in it. There's mesh pockets on the side of it, 4 on the front,and it has two separate containers on the inside. It's the perfect size for putting an ice scraper, an emergency kit, first aid kit, anti-freeze, a map, and even more. There's honestly so much room in this, it can hold up to 40 lbs, and even has velcro on the bottom so that it won't slide around or tip over.  The material is also very sturdy, it'd take a long time before you'd ever need a new organized after this one. I'm really impressed with this product. It's great if you have a lot of things just sort of floating around in the back of your car. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, all experiences are my own.
B0093AA91I|5|this is an excellent  car windshield shade fits perfect to our ml430
B000CP2DSU|4|Thank you!
B00FW1VFAG|4|Was a bit difficult to assemble, as the directions were not clear at all, but once together the product is great
B00VNJ4PEO|3|Although this was supposed to fit my car (2009 Kia Spectra), it did not. The connectors provided were both too small. I have not had the time to go out to try to find the proper connector, so in the mean time, I have attached it to my car with some packing tape. It appears to be helping my car's reception. I hope it will get better when I get the correct connector.
B00E9G07JK|5|On my boat since May. 12 volt or higher all day.
B000VS8DZU|2|Doe's not work like it side
B002IKWG4I|5|Great gloves, as expected.
B00IF6400C|5|Great Chainring, nice climb friendly 36t is an improvement over the 38t.
B00I176C92|4|works good, no instruction.  i was able to put it on without having to remove the bumper which was nice.
B00DVN7UJM|1|It was not charged when received, put a battery charger on it and it would not hold a charge.  It was returned very easily and money was refunded very quickly
B00D7O19CO|5|I ordered a Michael Kors watch when am I getting it
B0036ZGJB0|1|These things are so flimsy it's impossible to get them to stay put. They went in the garbage can, and I bought a much better cork set.
B001MSEJFG|5|Perfect fit for what I purchased it for. Very good price.
B000T9YKAS|5|Good  product
B00CUN0Z82|5|goog quality, worked well
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Perfect for the beach. Once the sand is du it just shakes right off. Big enough for a family of four.
B005OXVP2U|5|Nice
B003EJF23O|5|These are great stickers.  They went on easy, appear to be very well made.  Only draw back is I didn't bother to pay attention to the fact that if order the dual sticker deal, they are not mirrored.  So if your'e putting them on your car on opposing sides they won't match.  I attached a photo of what they look like on my 94 Accord Ex.
B000PA00XM|1|Did not work.  Sent it back.
B00CMP3Z1C|5|used it to jump my harley. did the job.
B00URSCLF2|5|Have doubts about how safe was this tool when I first got it.<br />It took me some time to get familiar with it but once I use it in the first strut, the second, third and fourth struts were even more easy.<br /><br />Was able  to compress the suspension springs and easily replace 4 struts on my 2005 ford Expedition.
B000KYYIRW|4|Product is perfect and works exactly as expected.  Delivery was great.  Zero complaints with the product.  Would have been 5-star but for no directions how to program the key fob to the car.  Had to YouTube it and Google to find out how. Instructions would have been nice, but maybe that is somewhat of an unrealistic expectation.  Product and company I highly recommend.  Price was good too.
B00YQ9Y6HE|2|The bottom red color of the flag looks more black then red, not satisfied with the purchase.
B00I1PFD4Y|4|Good product, recommend
B009AA2FAY|5|Perfect, installed with no headache, the light and code went out on first start up. Please have your codes checked before spending the money on any parts. There is several points of possible failure in the air bag system.
B00L87RBUG|2|was wrong one
B004MEH78S|4|Very easy to apply!
B008032PVG|2|I bought this fuel pump for both my Chevy s10 and my GMC Sonoma and while it worked perfectly for my GMC it did not for my Chevy. For my s10 it only reached a pressure level of 15psi which is way too low in order for the vehicle to operate. Now I have to buy a more expensive fuel pump to get my truck to work. I'm not sure why it worked for one truck and not the other. Therefore I believe the product is a bit of a gamble to whether or not it will work.
B0049XKO1O|5|A product of excellence
B00AM3GONC|5|Perfect
B00VVF4O7S|5|great product stay put
B00NNYLBS0|5|Nice plugs, they work great on my 2010 Bmw 535i, Thank You.
B00Y5L7YX6|5|This looks good a little bigger than the original but feels great. Nice job sickspeed I love it .
B00TNSMDBY|5|Love this!
B00ANVNVB6|1|Immediately after driving less than 5 miles after putting these on,  2 flew off onto the highway. What a huge waste of money,  wish I could return them
B00CHDBPFM|5|Great product and fit very well. The plastic was slightly thinner than OEM's is but was not by any means cheap milk carton material. I also did not have any issues installing it as all of the holes lined up perfectly. I would most definitely purchase this product again. I did have to move my wheels one direction or another to get my ratchet into some the bolts that were on the inside of the wheel well so I didn't have to take off my tire.
B00RLY4C2A|5|perfect
B00KTJRGFE|5|It fits to my truck, arrived a little late and installed it. GREAT!
B00HSHWA92|5|nice
B006ZSUKXI|5|I have very little automotive repair experience and I Installed a pair of these week ago in about 20 minutes. They have been great - I've had no problems.
B0002MB80C|5|This is my third Pilot Genuine Leather steering wheel cover.  I have not replaced one yet, I just have one on all three vehicles.  Quality product, much better than the vinyl wheel covers in the auto parts stores.  A little slick in the beginning, but it just gets better with age/time.  My oldest leather cover feels the best!
B000E4SODC|4|Fit great thanks again .
B011JA8BVE|4|Removing the product from the cars cigarette reciprocal is just a tad difficult, it is not a one handed task, or atleast not a light handed task. I have to be very firm with extracting and fear that my sensitive car reciprocal could get damaged or damage the charger itself. The 4 usbs work though and work well, easily charging my Iphone, android, kindle, and ipod. There is a blue light that shines from behind the usb slots to indicate that the devise has power and my only qualm is that I wish each individual usb slot had its own small light to distinguish in the future if any of them fail or are having issues. But the fact that this usb has a light in any case is a huge plus since my car likes to be finicky about being plugged. It is a little bigger than I assumed but does not get in the way and I will update with photos shortly. I'm on the fence of using it as my go to car charger only because of the in and out I will have to do because my car has battery issues and I can not leave a devise plugged in, if there was a way to leave it in but turned off, to were it was not drawing power that would be ideal. But most owners will not have these sort of issues I face with my 2001 Ford Focus. I really wanted a 4 usb slot car charger since I commonly have 4 electronics in my car if not 5 or 6, 2 phones, a gps, a kindle, a DS, and an ipod, Krieger was running a promotion to request to receive this product for review that I was able to participate in and know that once I upgrade my car this charger will be of huge use to me.
B000C9R1D8|5|Works as it should and easy to instal on my '03 GMC Envoy XL.
B000E4SQIA|5|10 minutes to install and speedometer works great
B00X2TUW1I|5|This is a great shade. It doesn't buckle or move on the window and it provides the shade we neede for our daughter.
B009AA39AY|5|Worked great
B00I8Z4M9O|5|great gun for clear coat sprays out very good
B000C9DHHM|5|My Tahoe is getting older and the knob to change the current temp was worn out on mine so I got this instead. It is super easy to install. There are remanufactured versions out there but the replacement one I ordered from a different place looked beat up so this was almost the same price without all the wear and tear the refurbished one had. It was a no brainier.
B00BD4SKY0|2|These look great when you first instal them. But the fabric doesn't breathe, and they started tearing within two months.
B0016KA88C|5|perfect fit really gave my vehicle a great look.
B008CH9JAA|1|Broke the same day I got them
B0091OE6II|3|Does. Not help seat belt from still hitting the neck and shoulder?
B00LBNHUQ2|5|Very blue
B002UC8LZW|5|Both items are of good quality.  The electrical cable solved my electrical issues with my tow vehicle.  I could pull a tank with the safety cables.
B00HW7XL2S|1|Siren burns out within two months. Im a firefighter. Not good to get a call and have no siren
B007KPVXV8|5|Just what my 1992 HD Fatboy needed. Front brakes would not pump up after a long storage, this did the trick.
B002LGBK8M|4|thanks
B00BMRRXU0|1|real flimsy never used will be sending back
B0068Q0YU6|5|Worked like it should have.
B008VJZ76Y|1|Dont buy incorrect ad by seller
B00S9S8G8I|5|Great product
B013D9QOI6|5|Just received the kit tonight.  It does indeed include all of the items in the first picture.  The item description showing 26 or so items is incorrect.  I am not a detailer, I'm just trying to get some dents out of my car.  At first glance the tools seem to be well built, however I have nothing to compare them to.  For the price this appears to be a great deal.  I will write more once I get a chance to try thing out.<br />08/30/2015 update:  I got a chance to try this kit out.  In my opinion, it's a very good kit.  All tools work as promised.  It seems this type of work is all about the glue.  The 2 yellow sticks worked great, the 2 clear sticks weren't as strong.  I guess it all depends what you are trying to do and the temperature near you.  Smaller dents are removed it 1-3 pulls.  I had a very large dent on the side roof from a tree branch that fell.  After about 2, 1 hour sessions, I almost have the whole thing out.  For the bigger jobs, you definitely need the dent hammer (the large t bar)  I would definitely recommend this kit.
B001DF7LCG|4|Great product fits great sounds excellent ....
B00DDZE33E|5|works just fine with our peddle boat
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with a bunch of different free apps from the Android store.
B005IS4N6G|5|Great kit. I do agree the lengths of the usb wires that come with this kit are very LACKING i have a g37 coupe and i still couldnt finish the loop. Ended up ordering adapters to finish the job. I love the mini SMDs thought very small and easy to place in the cabin.<br /><br />Also for those who think you need to turn it on everytime you start the car. Look up the actual user manual on LEDGLOWS website. They tell you how to activate the automatic feature. But yea other than the wire length problems this kit solid!
B000BQYH3Y|4|An OK deal. This kit includes all the fuses you should need for a few years. It also includes some helpful 3 and 7.5 amp fuses which I can use for the furnace and other home use.
B00JA3BMDW|4|My husband and I remodel old homes. I've been wanting to get one of these non-contact infrared guns for a while. The Nubee temperature gun is just the thing I was looking for. A simple point and click and it gives an accurate reading either in Fahrenheit or Celcius. I can now find the cold spots in the houses we remodel. No more guessing if the insulation is working or if the windows are good. I received this in exchange for providing' my honest opinion. Bonus, only three buttons to deal with and it is simple to understand.
B0082AOAYC|5|FIT GOOD -- LOOKS GOOD -- NICE PART
B000C8ZAQY|5|nice heavy clamp
B00YBDNL44|2|low quality and didn't even come with the right leads. the switch is really just a cheap flimsy piece of plastic and the harness was shipped with two wire leads pulled out of the switch... Not that great of a deal at all. beware. I'm going to have to buy another harness.
B00VKM3S4C|2|Very light weight, fabric is kind of &#34;hard&#34; and has left small scratches in my paint. Wouldn't recommend it for a new car. Ordered the &#34;Stormproof&#34; from CoverKing when it became available.
B007ZJ749O|5|Works very well and easy to use. Just make sure you fill to the bottom of the meniscus for both the water and fuel. You go by the bottom of the meniscus. Do that and you'll have no problems getting an accurate reading. Also I used a plastic syringe to add fuel to the tube as it's easier to control the flow to get the precise amount needed. You can use a glass pipette as well. Only takes about 5 minutes for the 2 liquids to separate. No need to shake hard, just a normal shaking for 5 or so seconds is fine.
B00861FK1E|5|Arrived on time, installed easily in about 30 minutes, fits perfect and sounds great! Has a nice deep aggressive growl and mellows out when in 6th gear, just installed today so can't wait to hear how it sounds when I get some miles on it and it starts to break in some! Taking the jeep on a road trip to Tennessee in about a month so I will see how it does on an 8 plus hour drive! So far I am extremely happy with this exhaust system the only complaint I have is they didn't include any magnaflow stickers to add to my collection of stickers on my tool box at the shop!
B00FJI8QLI|5|Have this hanging inside my car since I bought a flower also and it's on the antenna. Very durable quality. Shipping was very fast. No doubt I will buy others for the different seasons.
B00480J4J6|5|I just bought these bulbs for my 2007 prius...and just like the other reviews say....this is the EXACT bulb that the Toyota factory uses!  LADIES!!  Do not be afraid to attempt to change these yourselves!  I'm a 40 year old woman and had no problem doing this myself.  A service tech at the dealership told me this was going to cost me $600 ($180 per bulb and $250 labor!)  I told him I could get the exact bulbs on Amazon for 41.00 a piece and I could do it in 20 minutes without taking the bumper off, so why did they charge so much???  With an indignant look, he told me good luck and not to get electrocuted! =)  I used that u-tube video suggested in the amazon reviews &#34;How to change your Prius HID bulb in 10 minutes&#34; and it was immensely helpful.  It took me about a half hour but I saved over $500 doing it myself!
B00SG7K7G6|5|great sticker...sticks well
B00NXRYMT2|5|GREAT BLADES , QUIET AND SWEEPS ALL WATER AWAY
B00RM26FVC|2|Literally broke after one day...  the little ring that keeps it on your key chain broke off and the day after the shifter fell out. I guess I already expected this though but be warned...
B00JA1VEAK|5|Fit my 2008 ford fusion.  My trunk lid is no longer a guillotine.  They were easy to install.
B001EZ8HVE|2|Installation instructions are difficult to understand, and poorly illustrated. Once you figure out the confusing instructions and awful illustrations, the actual installation is pretty easy. The hitch itself is poorly designed: the receiver does not extend far enough back from the frame of the hitch to easily install the hitch pin to hold the draw bar in place -- and some models of locking hitch pins (such as the Harbor Freight 99549) simply cannot be installed: there's no room for that large rotating head.
B007JMOY22|5|As described. Appears heavyduty.
B004NV6BJG|3|The mirrors are great as far as size, visibility, and fit go.<br /><br />but adjusting them is a nightmare. Its like theyre missing some washers or something. if you try to rotate them one way or the other it tightens or loosens them. So if youre going to be setting them one the road you have to have an allen wrench in your pocket.
B00GNU37QU|5|Item as describe, fast shipping
B009S2ZPTC|5|I bought this abut a month ago and so far it is holding up to what it sad. I love the fell of it and looks grate on my 96 F150 XLT 4X4. I even use to shut my door. easy install, they say you have to take door panel off but you don't  took me 1min poor door.
B009OBW5XQ|5|Pretty good carpet cleaner, but cant get heavy stains off. I spray it on and vacuum it off. I like the smell. it does lift the dirt off because i sprayed it on my foot rest which had holes in it that was trapped with dirt. The dirt was lifted up so i could wipe it off ! if I didnt spray this product, I would have to use Qtip to get all the tiny spots
B000NWJJLG|2|It doesn't work as well as the glass treatment only.  It is better to use Windex to clean and use the Rain-X glass treatment.
B006X8BH8C|5|The edges were bent when it arrived, but they were easy to straighten. You could see the grey grill underneath so I painted with a quality flat black. I made sure to use a plastic primer first. The overlays were easy to install the fit is great. I've gotten a lot of complements. Great for a quick and easy facelift.
B000NW4OL6|5|Very good
B0092KVYGI|5|Reads pretty accurate so i can monitor my car's alternator's performance
B003L35936|5|Great filter. Bit expensive but quality costs.
B001V8U12M|5|Finally recieved this second time around, was not disappointed.
B00T0WZYMS|1|Came a little roughed up. With tint any little crease creates bubbles and headaches..
B000NPGG0U|5|I drive a chevrolet spark (small car) fitted perfect except for the back ones they kinda fit big but didn't mind it you can't tell. Small pink stain that I don't mind neither because they will get dirty either way love them totally recommend them!
B00YDDC2I8|5|This windshield sunshade is  a wonderful creation it fits  perfect on my car. its excellent protection against the sun for my kids it also helps 99% sun heat and uv rays protection its also made of strong material quality.perfect for your os suv and also to keep your kids away from damege of the sun.
B004ZF3Y40|5|Love these. They are the best light I could find. You will have no complaints in these
B001CO4WA2|5|This Bosch coil is the best one out there and you can't be the price on amazon!
B00UGDAVKU|5|Works great!
B000C4087Y|5|This is my second purchase of this item which speaks volumes. 5+++
B002E30O9S|5|perfect fit
B000HZT89C|5|It a nice item, helps to keep the trash in one place. Great seller.
B005Q0F9PA|5|bright & fast shipping！
B00TK2WQBA|1|Very high quality label. Printing is very sharp and crisp. Very easy to remove. A HINT ON ATTACHING. I'm retired from the sign business and the following suggestion is what we did. We would peel off the label from the backing, We would then spray the back of it with a little Windex (not much). This would enable us to slide it around the surface until we got it to where we wanted it.<br /><br />We then would pat it down working from the middle outward with long soft strokes. This would work out any trapped air from under it. We then would let it dry.
B00TV8JXJG|5|Beautiful plate!  Made of heavy guage aluminum and very bright and colorful.  We even got a complement on the plate from a fellow motorist.
B000CIK5DM|1|Pros:<br />Easy installation even on a hot motor (I'm impatient at times).<br />Noticeable part throttle power increase<br />No &#34;whistle&#34;, but I'm damned near deaf.<br /><br />Cons:<br />HUGE negative effect on my MPG.  Seriously, HUGE.<br /><br />I drive a 2010 FX4 with a 6&#34; lift, 35&#34; tires and 3.73 gears.  I have changed all fluids to synthetic, installed a K&N CAI, SCT tuner with custom tunes by 5 Star, and a Dynomax single cat back exhaust.  Prior to installation of this item, I could get 16mpg on the highway, but averaged about 12.5mpg when you added around town driving.  The spacer was added when I was approximately 200miles into a tank of fuel with at least half of that being on the highway.  After installation, I set out on another highway trip expecting to watch my in-dash MPG raise since I was driving sensibly.  Typically, I could get .1 better for each 35-40 miles of highway depending upon wind.  After 100 miles, I finally got my .1, but when I filled up after 340 miles (for the tank), my average was down to 11.9!!!!  Prior to this, I could get 10.8 flying down the highway at 95+.<br /><br />Around town driving saw me lose .1 mpg on the dash every 10 miles or so, and it was NOT because I was driving differently.<br /><br />For me, the power increase is not worth the trade-off so this one is going back.  The second one that I purchased for another 5.4 we have will never have the seal broken on the box, it's going back too.<br /><br />I guess if these things were as good as they say they are, the factory would install them to begin with.  Translation:  a fool and his money are quickly separated.
B001QUI546|5|Everything came as described. Fast shipping
B00GSAUHB8|1|To small for my Honda pilot
B00K5VP7F2|5|I attached this to my car window months ago, so it's been exposed to crazy heat, and rain, and as stayed on perfectly.
B004TMP18G|5|Eliminated stubborn ping in my old '94 Taurus, restoring full acceleration after 900 miles.  I also used the XADO EA120 in the transmission and it  now shifts effortlessly.  XADO for Power Steering eliminated the car's moaning sound when turning in the driveway.    You might ask:  why don't major oil companies use XADO's primary ingredient, boron carbide, if it works so well?  The answer:  some companies like Mobil 1 do, but only in trace amounts (...).  XADO 1 has a much greater concentration.    Small wonder this company has been so successful in making this product for 20 years.  It dominates the ceramic additive market in Russia and is widely used in Eastern Europe and Great Britain.  Its sale in the U.S. has been expanding in the last ten years.    Detergents will of course prepare your car for XADO's results.  I used Liqui Moly Engine Flush in the crankcase and Automatic Transmission Cleaner for 15 minutes before fluid changes.    **Follow-up:  Six months later I had a state inspection that checked the emissions levels at the tailpipe.  The car passed with flying colors, like a brand new car!/><br />I should note that I do not represent or sell any the products mentioned in this review.
B00UVXR8CE|5|Nice covers!  These are not cheap or thin.  Good Fit (could stay tucked better at seat fold but otherwise excellent).  Great Value!
B00NXDGE38|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B0012BQ75S|5|I installed this to my 2005 GMC Envoy and works like what it said to be. Boost up power and save me additional mileage on gas.
B00OTY3NX4|5|Liked it so much that I even got the same tattoo on my back,proud supporter of our U.S. Military
B003PIPBQC|5|great quality
B000CO9U32|3|-Easy to install.  Took about 1.5 hrs.<br />-Noticeable difference in HP and noise.  Noise is not load but you can hear it in the cab.  It is not bothersome.<br />-Slight increase in MPG after installation (~0.5-1.0 mpg).
B00DSD78K6|3|Where's his nose?! Lol Still cute though!
B00NTCRSH4|5|Right product, right time and prompt service. Well done. Keep it up...
B001Q8IXW2|4|Best wax and polish applicator for leather goods
B00MS99Q1A|4|Good
B009OOQVYW|5|It came with in 4 days and it's installed and still good!
B00CIOHNOM|5|Worked as they were supposed too and went on in a snap, I added a bit of grease to smooth things up but it was not necessary.
B00K3XW37M|5|That is exactly what you pay thanks<br />Good seller tanks!!
B00CFCI36Y|4|The trim to fit feature was great fot customizing them to my Jeep Wrangler

B00DOWQAOG|5|This product is amazing, i follow the direction and add a 2 layer of nanoshock. Very satisfied with the resualt
B002R0Y63S|4|Perfect fit, fast delivery
B005N73WQY|5|My son loved it
B00F9LPJ8S|5|cant believe that little battery has that much cranking power
B007JEJQP0|5|Fit my 2014 Honda CRV perfectly. Did not feel completely comfortable installing myself, so took it to a local truck accessories dealer and they installed it for me for $90. Took them about an hour to install where it probably would've taken me all afternoon. Works great.
B001ADFC9U|5|LOve this thing! Should have bought it years ago. Keeps things neatly tucked away. Some reviews indicated that the compartment separators were flimsy. I did not find that to be the case at all. The separators are very sturdy and have u-shaped notches in them that allows for convenient storage for long items such as a golf size umbrella, while still utilizing the separate individual compartments. Very cool design.
B00HHGSDHC|5|If you puchased this, remove the ABS sensor and get a grease gun filled with synthetic grease aknd make it go into the bearing. Not easy but doable. This WILL force out China grease at back of bearing and give the best chance of making them last. Update: Parts arrived in Philippines, via sea freight in excellent shape. Looks to be of good quality and complete. To buy this here is $900 for one !!! I'm well satisfied with this product and will update again once installed. UPDATE: Fitted these hubs, perfect fit and so far so good. Make sure you torque hub bolt to 160 to 170 ft lbs, also used their supplied abs leads and no problem, make sure you use spacers supplied. Would definitely recommend Detroit Axle hubs.
B001JDE6ZW|5|Great product!<br />Great for quick replacement.
B00T3W3FB2|5|Note - I received this product free of charge for review purposes.<br /><br />&#34;Son,&#34; my dad said, &#34;There are some things a man has to do for himself.  He really should change his own tires, his own oil, and his own brakes.  So you're going to learn how to do it and it'll be your job to keep the car running.&#34;<br /><br />Why *I* had to do it for the family car instead of my dad if those are things &#34;a man has to do for himself&#34; was never explained to me.  Whatever, he taught me a life skill and I'm grateful.<br /><br />To be sure, if you are going to be doing brake jobs for a living, this is probably not the kit for you.  That isn't to say it's bad quality...it isn't.  That isn't to say this won't do *as* good a job as a different kit...it will.  I simply have some concerns about whether this is designed to be used, day in and day out, over an extended period of time.  I think the aim is very much for the shade tree mechanic or home handyman (handyperson?) who will use this occasionally or loan it out to friends for the odd job.<br /><br />Somewhat serendipitously, I was offered this for review as I was thinking about changing the brake fluid on one of the cars...when it's turned pitch black and gross, well, it's time.  Normally I'd take advantage of the loaner tool program at my local auto parts store, but since this crossed my transom I was able to give it a try...and it worked very well.  I think one little thing (and yes, it's silly) that I really liked was the pocket in the case where the instruction manual fit.  It kept the manual dry and clean...not that the manual itself was super valuable (it is pretty broad in terms of instructions...), but the pocket was also nice in which to keep my little cheat sheet for the cars.  Hey, I can't remember *everything*.<br /><br />So there you go.  It works.  It's what I call &#34;good enough&#34; quality...again, if you're just doing this for the family car or whatever, it's really all you need.  I figure there's no point in paying for bulletproof construction if you aren't going to be dodging bullets, after all.  It did the job for me, did it with no fuss, and I'm very happy with it.gure there's no point in paying for bulletproof construction if you aren't going to be dodging bullets, after all.

B000AUMYMM|5|Highly impressed! If you get the right brushes, take your time, and follow the directions it gives you a very smooth, high gloss professional look. I put on three pain coats and added the Brembo high temp stickers to my new red Brembo brakes. My neighbor argued with me that I had to have replaced the brakes because there is no way I could have just hand painted them.
B00CUX5T2Y|4|Delivered on time, easy install the reason I only gave it a 4 is because I have not towed any thing yet.
B0016L9VM0|5|Cool product
B000UIY5TO|4|Great price on this!! Works, and that is what is important!!
B00T4Y62IC|3|I thought I would give this thing a shot now that I'm using my phone more as a GPS than I'm actually using my GPS.<br /><br />The mount fit the vents in my 2007 HHR snuggly, and the mount itself SEEMS like it would hold a phone well, except it won't fit mine with a case on it.<br /><br />I think most people today use cases, and the fact that this mount is so shallow is probably the main issue. If the manufacturer had made the arms (which have firm gripping pads on them) deeper, I think more phones would fit, and the product would be better.<br /><br />I like the &#34;new car&#34; smell that came with it, and bought a couple of the other smells. I'll still use this as an air freshener in my car and it might serve a purpose as a mount for passengers on long trips.
B0062TP14I|5|My decal arrived quickly and looks better than pictured. I love it!
B000EQDN5E|5|As advertised, quick delivery
B00W2D7S9O|5|Worked perfectly!

B00LHB08C6|3|Not really bad
B00VDYXWDO|5|Arrived very fast and just as described
B00KJGPQE0|5|good and fast
B00NLUU1SC|5|Using this as front side markers on a 2013 Ford Explorer, Had the smaller JDM ones prior and they started flickering after about a month, however these are still going strong. Guess Time will tell.
B00DJSH0YY|4|It worked good, little tight fit, but still got it to work,
B00S8A0932|5|Great product.  It helps me keep my car neat and organized and keeps stuff from falling down between my seats and console.
B00I5RXN7C|5|Very easy to install my work van looks like a big warehouse at night. it is so bright.
B00BHD69PY|3|I would have given this product 5-stars but there is the screw which holds the Key Fob is too short and does not allow for you room to attach to a key ring.
B00YC28OUU|5|I really like these handles. Easy to install and look nice as well as sturdy. The loop for hanging clothes is very handy. Only installed those in the back of the car.
B00YNNAQI6|5|Awesome, fits perfect
B00A3UNYW8|4|I got it on the date it was supposed to get here and I can't wait to try it I will get back to you when I do.
B005XO3OII|5|These works great with my 2008 Chrysler Town and Country. The headphones and remote worked out of the box...my kids and I love this product!
B009J7O7J0|5|This puller worked perfectly for me. Save yourself the time and trouble by using this with an impact wrench. Worked beautifully on my Vulcan.
B00J9TZ8N2|5|Fantastic cover, love the fit and the look is very classy.
B00W8LQBK2|5|Wonderful fits perfect. Would higly recommend to all jeep owners
B00HE68G22|5|All in one solution. Has clear coat included as well. Will be a repeat customer!
B009XJ0D6K|4|Another perfect fit & quality from Acerbis! However, gave it 4 stars as the kit did NOT arrive as pictured. The rear fender arrived orange NOT white. I had ordered graphics according to a white rear fender. Seller WAS willing to take entire kit back for full refund. I chose to order a white fender & now have an orange spare. Seller did not have ability to exchange. Still a great price & product from seller IMO.
B004AJFCMI|5|HEAVY DUTY!! Welds are strong.These are what you want on your vehicle for recovery. Put these on my Westin grill gaurd for my 2009 Tacoma TRD. Look great next to my winch. They can be mounted inside or underside of winch gaurd.Hope this helped. Be safe and be smart and get out.
B003WDEYPE|5|Good flexible cord, standard connectors
B003YJJS2U|1|This cover is not water proof. The first time it rained I removed the cover and the motor assembly was soaked, and could not dry out due to the cover holding the moisture in. Buying it for looks? Okay! Buying it to protect your tongue jack? Forget it!
B00JREPRJE|5|These fit perfect on my Prius I did not know that underneath the ugly hubcaps of my 2011 there was alloyed rims so I ordered the Lee's little caps for the center and it's like I have brand-new mags on my car everyone should orderlies it fit on my 2011 Prius
B00LO3QYUW|5|awesome fit and work perfectly.
B00GPO2N82|5|Shipping took awhile but I got them yesterday! So I hopped on my sporty and went for a ride. They are excellent! Kept wind and dust out of my eyes and was able to turn my head without them flying off.I will be ordering a couple pair of back ups  for when these ones wear out as my others did(took a couple years) wich lead to me buying these I will be ready.(I hate shopping for glasses cause I'm picky. Couldn't find any local so I took to amazon). Definitely recommend! !!
B00BK86SFM|5|Fit perfectly on my 2009 Murano.
B0014H94UA|4|Purchased this gasket for water pump for 2004 trail blazer. The one that came with pump was a cheap paper gasket and I didn't want to pull pump back out because of a leak.
B004LX3AS6|5|Good product that works, but it may take a while to charge to 100%
B00292FA6G|5|Satisfied. Thanks
B001P2X4EQ|1|Poor quality, poor welds, used on my atv and couldn't support 30lbs  without bending the hitch. I had to support rack with chains to avoid sagging. Poor poor quality and design.
B008D70RP0|3|Easy to install. No issues so far.
B0012FD5J0|5|This little device has changed our camping experience - they are amazing.<br />We purchased two (one for each side of the camper).  It almost completely eliminates the shaking and fwd / backward rocking that we experienced before.<br /><br />If your camper is rocking when you walk around inside, it's almost certainly a result of the camper shifting forward and backwards on its wheels.  This product wedges itself in between the tires and keeps your RV from shifting.  Bottom line, it is much less expensive than the steel models, and it's 100% effective.<br /><br />Pros:  Light, easy to store, cheap<br />Cons:  Can't lock them, only works with DUAL AXLE trailers<br /><br />One last tip, I would suggest that you still use at least one wheel chock in front of the downhill tire to ensure your camper stays safe.
B00V7UUQYW|5|I Installed this amazing LED Bar in my Jeep Wrangler YJ Sahara, and it is incredibly good! It is very bright, looks gorgeous in my jeep, and my entire family could not be happier with this excellent product. SUPER LED LIGHT BAR!!!!!
B00GZWE4GI|5|Fit 1999 Chevy Silverado.
B00J3NPOI8|1|Poor Quality.  It fit so tight it ripped when I tried to put it on the tire.
B006811J9G|5|really cute stocking stuffer for a Christmas gift
B00K56JZNW|1|The size and silver chrome color were right for my 2015 Hyundai Genesis. However, during hot weather in Southern California, the glue melted and not strong enough to secure and slide away from the side of doors. I've to adjust the alignment from time to time. The glue was messy and hard to remove from the surface. The strip has been taken away after 2 weeks.
B00B1ENIJO|4|it's thin and and the edges is not tall enough so dirt and soils can get out easily.  It's still work for me.
B011PJ6IG4|5|got them for a friend he loves them thanks
B00F40TVQK|5|Good for price
B000IY9T1O|5|Received quickly.  Installed relatively quickly on my Mazda 5.  Air wrench is helpful for the long lower shock bolt.
B0002NIKW0|5|arrived quickly and item is described and works as expected.
B00HVVVEYM|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00KTIAREM|3|One programmed within one minute, the other I'm going to need to take to a locksmith. Either way, I still have peace of mind knowing my alarm is set now
B00A2XLSD8|5|they fit and look beautiful I recommend them to anyone
B004A5LCMQ|5|Made well. It would definitely take a while for a thief too break off.
B00825ZI0C|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0009IR0EM|5|Better trapping than the FRAM ULTRA 99% vs 97%. This FRAM Tough Guard sacrifices longevity (10,000 vs 7,500 miles intervals) for trapping ability (99% vs. 97%) compared to the FRAM Ultra Extended.  I race my 1993 Toyota Celica GT (with 183,000 miles on it :-)) at the track and the occasional autocross (and sometimes use it as a second car for errands around town) so I would rather have superior oil filtering at 99% over an extra 2,500 miles (I don't wait that long anyway).  I use the recommended semi-synthetic oil and NOT full synthetic because of the high miles, and this filter is rated to deal with it.  Over all I'm happy with the performance and would recommend it to others.
B001GJ9K8C|5|Product does a good job.
B00H4CY9TK|5|Had fun with this!
B0040CRREG|5|This work great for hondas, nicely priced and good to have on hand.
B00XI05PUY|5|Excellent fit and very comfortable
B00L4HCMDG|5|Sometimes in life you get what you pay for. Kanu Locks are such a time. I'm glad I bought this product. It is easy to use and adds peace of mind knowing that my boards are secured to my rack and WILL still be there if I stop somewhere along the way from or to paddling. The straps are plenty long enough to secure several boards should you need to. The pads around the locks prevent any damage to your vehicle. The locks themselves work easily. This is a great product from a great company.
B0018LMSDC|5|I just  installed these.  Yes, there is more vibration trasmitted to the rest of the car, but the engine doesn't have as much movement as before.  These product claims to only fit the manual transmission, but alas, it fits the automatic as well!<br /><br />If you want to have a vibration-free ride (relatively, as this inline-4 engine is not balanced that well), don't get these.  These are for performance only, not comfort.<br /><br />I chose the black inserts since ES claims they are self-lubricating with graphite or something.  No one is going to be looking at your engine mounts, anyway.
B003CJHZUY|5|Very good
B008E9Q1OI|5|Great quality sticker. Good color quality and material. The design is superb!
B000WJ5HA2|5|fit perfectly for my cbr 1000
B00LI15HSA|5|Took the key to the dealership & it programmed with no problems.
B000CQ4B8E|5|Just what I wanted
B00AN5MZ2I|5|Fits perfectly!!! Wish I would have ordered it sooner!!
B001HXZT14|5|Of course everyone needs these on their key ring. Great quality too.
B00UBZ70K2|5|I see reviews for GP Thunder bulbs all over the map so I was a little hesitant before buying these.  Yes, you can't go wrong for the price but I was afraid of them somehow fouling up the wiring on my new car as I saw some reviews where people said they fried their wire harness.  I had 6000k HIDs on my previous two cars but this go round I was looking to possibly bypass them but I still wanted something other than the &#34;yellow &#34; look of stock halogen bulbs.  These bulbs so far seem to have fit the bill.  So far no problems at all.  Are they as bright as HIDs, no, but I now do not have to worry about ballast placement, relay harness hock ups, etc.  From what I can tell they are a bit brighter than the stock halogen bulbs.  When looking at the headlights straight on they are white with a slight tint of blue but the beam output on the road is white.  If you are skeptical and want a HID look without the hassle, I say go for it!  I just ordered a second set as a backup just in case as I am not sure what the life expectancy of these bulbs is going to be.
B0000AXR5Z|5|Installs easily and solidly.  Doesn't vibrate while boat is in motion.
B009GJNH88|3|comfortable, pretty, well noticable but noisy. still trying to find adequate ear plugs to make it a comfortable ride. a full street helmet may be the better choice.
B00EQ1IOS4|1|i think someone has open the box before because when i get the order miss folding knife and stainless steel wire with patches
B00CZEZNGU|5|Bright pleasant light. Sturdy switch easy to find by feel. Simple installation, easy on batteries, works on a wide voltage range without change of color.
B00RCA2EX2|1|These do not come close to fitting a 2000 Dodge ram, they are 1/4 to wide, and almost an inch to short to fit where the factory lights go. The factory lights screw in and have a lens that locks into place, these use double sided sticky tape. The shape of the lenses are completely different also.
B00BFDFYT8|5|Genuine OEM part; fixed my Odyssey's power steering whine.
B00317BA6M|5|I love these cams!  I got the sound I want, I got the power I want and a much easy start then even the stock cams.  Now I can do the 103 upgrade without needing to change out or drill the stock heads for compression relief!  Sweet!
B00V4K5Y0Q|3|This is a relatively low quality product. Bottom line: pay a tad more for a quality item like Fox. Edges are frayed, cheap plastic clips, and a flimsy fit at best. Had I know it was coming form China I a) would not have ordered it and b) would return it if it wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg.
B00F5MUB66|5|Outstanding product! Will buy one for the house next.
B00W512FKK|5|worked right the first crank of the engine,  great little carburetor.
B009P7QVJS|4|fit good
B00EJR64FK|5|great bayttery for the [price!
B009OBVRY4|5|Very useful tool to assist with waxing and polishing your car...fun to use!
B000AAM2Z6|4|What can I say... Your Harley will just shed parts if you don't use this stuff on absolutely everything!  A necessity<br />.
B00KWMI5KS|4|Good for daily wear.  They are like lead---so heavy they stay in one place.  Good products
B00XZ9MXQM|1|Does not work for my 2006 rx8 6sp..will not program
B001Y91CRQ|5|excellent
B00STVQCDQ|5|Awesome very cute!
B0009H51LC|5|Excellent product and seller!
B000CQBG1O|5|I had to replace my o2 sensor and it was in a place where you just can't get any torque. I had to cut off my old spring bolts to get the small pipe off and work at it on the table to extract the sensor. These spring bolts made a good replacement after that was done. I don't think i can cut them off with bolt cutters because they're a bit thicker than the old ones but hopefully they won't rust out as bad as the old ones.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Very easy to put on and take off the windows
B00ZLPABGC|5|Great mirrors looks like part of the mirror because of being frame less look
B00HUEFROS|5|Great Product! This solved my exterior temperature sensor's incorrect reading. It read 36' F on an 80' F day, causing the air conditioning not to work (it is a fail safe to keep occupants from freezing themselves). Now it reads correct on the climate control and my A/C works! Genuine AC Delco product. Please click the helpful button if you found this review informative and helpful. Thanks!
B00B99U24A|5|AAA
B00T47K604|4|Bought this to extend the seatbelt for my Grandma who has limited mobility due to a stroke. It definitely makes it easier for her to buckle in. It also positions the shoulder strap in a more comfortable place for her.
B00Y5GNOK8|5|I was a little skeptical at first considering there were no reviews yet, but I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. Fits perfectly, my twelve year old self would be proud of me for having an right ball shift knob.
B00JLJO8EU|5|Works very well.
B006BJ2CJG|4|We got this to put on our recycling can to distinguish it from our garbage can. We received it in October of 2014, and so far it has survived a Michigan winter just fine (It is now August 2015). We keep our cans in the garage most of the time, and put the cans out on the curb the night before pick up.
B006B3BRDO|1|LASTED 5 MONTHS .....Poor Chinese quality ..Then had to pay to get them replaced again. LED's are suppose to last twice as long as candescent bulbs. Would have pay more!!  At least the factory bulbs that lasted 7 years
B0096BH8NQ|5|Fit perfectly
B00WED0XKI|5|This thing really, really works. I have been keeping it in my gym bag to keep odors down. I have a pair of shoes I just leave in the bag so it can get pretty smelly. Once I put this bag in there though it cleared the odors right up. I also used it in my car for a couple of days after taking my dog to the Vet. By the end of the first day the wet dog smell was gone. I have not done the &#34;recharge in the sunshine&#34; feature yet but I think that is pretty cool if it works. So far, very pleased.
B00546MAM6|5|good product
B009KTAZF2|5|Nice
B00LNDKXF0|5|fast service like jimmy johns
B00JIIZCM6|4|Still haven't found a leather cleaner that gets EVERYTHING out. It gets most of the dirt, though.
B008FWCLHU|5|Fit my 2011 BMW M3 perfectly (its not as long as the OEM battery but the bottom clamp has several locations for different battery lengths). Posts and vent fit great. I'm going to try it without re-programming the car. So far its working fine.
B00JPLH7VK|5|I have this on the inside if my toolbox, I love it.
B00EP6VSGK|4|Product delivered as describe. Easy install
B0009IK5RG|1|Streaky
B00E3SHW5Q|1|Bought this to install on 2015 Silverado..Good instructions and seemingly simple to install. 2 bolts supplied were too short and had to grind off 1/4&#34; of rubber anchor which was no small feat nor should I have had to do this for a package costing over $300 dollars..Went from bad to worse when I installed the bracket on the back stake and tried to remove the hardware to reposition it and the nut retainer on the bracket supplied from Putco broke and had to grind off the outside nut from the bed side of the pick-up to remove the entire assembly..Very poor design, nut retainer should have been welded onto the bracket..  I called the company to ask about the bolts and to their credit, they tried to find out what was going wrong with no luck (told me this had never happened before..anyone heard that before?)..I've been working on cars and trucks all my life and know how to install/replace most things and this was just totally aggravating from start to finish due to the hardware issues.
B002H974LK|5|Nice
B00VN140P6|5|It's a very good Cup, just like I think
B007DKQGQC|1|I could have printed myself at home
B0002MABGE|1|This barrier is easily manipulated for a dog to get out of the back.  The horizontal bars easily slide up and down, and the ends of them do not lock in place out so they can move inward as well. Total piece of junk, I am disappointed I missed my return window.
B002FOO884|5|I replaced my plugs for the first time with these @ 123K miles as a proactive maintenance measure as my FJ was running just fine. I can't say that my truck is running any better but it's definitely not running worse so I would say that at the very least these are the perfect replacement for the OEM plugs. NOTE: the OEM plugs I took out were also DENSO, just not the iridium. I expect the iridium long-life plugs will perform even longer but we'll see ... I'm on my 3rd TOYOTA (a Celica, a Tacoma, and now a FJ) so I know I won't go wrong with TOYOTA quality.
B00EE6NJ5O|2|IAM still waiting for long term results..........
B001208HES|5|Easy install, and very well made. Looks very nice on my quad!
B00AAICNPW|5|great for the price  and super fast shipping

B002NF13RY|4|held up with wet sanding
B001J7M4QG|5|As advertised, loud and attention getting!
B00VHAYRGU|4|Gas Pedal install difficult for DIY on CLS550. Brake Pedals easy install. Good quality, looks great!! Would purchase again.
B00MOUBQ70|5|They fit perfect
B00LLQE0B2|5|The kit is a good value with quality made parts from Taiwan. To my surprise the kit included the two cam gears and the sprocket gear, these are typically found with kits at a much higher price range.
B00DWVN08I|5|Looks great in my new truck!
B00JAQHJVS|4|Heck ye...with the body lift gave me 5&#34; lift...enough to clear 35&#34; (Fierce Attitude) tires On my Dodge 2500 4x4 (with the V10 488ci beast)!!
B007ZJ8150|5|Excellent
B00T8R7PPY|3|Shoddy wiring into light housing
B00E1SL70E|3|NOT A GOOD FIT IN MY TRUCK, SELLER HELP ME OUT TO PROCESSED FOR THE RETURN. IT'S A GOOD FEELING THAT CALLAHAN REALLY CARES FOR THEIR CLIENTS
B00EWPVMWY|5|Easily installed and works perfectly to cure the dreaded &#34;death rattle&#34; common to the early oilheads on startup.
B000GUPNJW|5|Sounds, AMAZING! Very easy to install
B00MBPT0F8|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I like the size of the lot (5).  I needed more than one, but didn't want a whole case.
B000CGK0AC|5|High quality product
B00AQFE2YO|5|Thought it would arrive in multiple pcs to assemble but wow! its ready to go on the roof right out of the box ,, well built and great paint job as well ,,
B0002MSY86|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B00HUM5TZM|5|Great works like a top perfect fit
B004W4OJRK|1|Shorty after buying these lights the LED and halo lights went out.  Don't waste your money.
B00DQ3VRDC|5|The product was easy to apply and looked exactly like the image.
B006FUT15Y|5|Meguiar's came through as anticipated! Easy to apply...looks great!
B00B9XDJQO|5|The Castrol LMA brake fluid is the BEST around! I think this package is a great value...especially if you're a home-mechanic and flushing out an old brake system full of crud. Want your brake system to last a long time? Get yourself a Vacula (or one of the popular knockoff's for around a hundred bucks) and flush out your system every other year or so.
B0050M2SIA|4|The fabric is rugged. Beware of size, I am XXL/3XL bought 4XL; midsection is 4XL, chest closer to 3XL, I have 21 &#34; neck top button is on either side of my trachea, must be 17/18 &#34; neck. But who needs the top button anyway I never do.
B00MGV0V3C|5|in hot wet houston weather these are a necessity. With pre-attached 3m mounting tape these are very easy to permanently install
B00HWI7K0Q|3|i was hoping they were a bit bulkier since the MDX is rather large. Good quality just hoped they were larger
B00BNVJZPQ|5|A good product!
B004YD1VIY|5|I use this all the time for my grandkids.
B000C9TUPA|5|Exactly what I needed and wires were more than long enough for any of my needs. Great product.
B00UADG1WI|5|Bought 6 of these for the price of 1 at auto parts store.  Only installed the one that was defective.  Works great.
B00FYHQSV4|5|Goes on the entry door of our travel trailer!
B001C97ZVA|5|Good filter. Catches dirt and lets the engine breathe.
B008QBT03I|3|Using this as blind spot mirror, the suction cup was good not sure why some users had issue with it (could be weather dependent may be , I tried it in summer), also the neck is stiff so it will not bounce up and down while driving the car,  I purchased two more to watch baby in back seat and to use as blind spot mirror in other car.  Edited(29/Aug/2015): Just received two mirrors I ordered and it had problem with suction cup no matter how I try its not holding up even for few seconds, the first one I purchased previously had no such issue and was holding very well, not sure what is the problem with this one, I think there is no quality check . I had to return one.
B003LNJWTI|1|Dont waste your time and money if you are looking for 2001 mustang headlights. Other than that i dont know how well they work
B00U1Y8DJU|5|I love this decal. Came in perfect size for my car. Probably not good for a pickup tho. 👍🏻
B00HWI3CRG|5|Excellent 100%
B000CAYSXS|5|fits good into toyota, tacoma
B00OJBPFGA|5|Bought this for my hubby for our wedding and he loved it! He collects watches and we met at a classic car show when I was driving my old Jeep, so this was perfect! The company was also awesome and shipped early and we're super responsive when I told them I had procrastinated and needed it super quickly.  Thank you!!!
B00BTGSGFK|5|THANKS I LOVE IT
B00MB0CSUW|5|Fits awesome in my truck and stays in place
B0024ECHII|5|Why wait, it's works and so easy.

B00VS4AREG|5|Works great
B00301CF18|3|Right now I can't give a good review because I got one and it worked amazingly so much brighter than the ones I have. I order another one and this one is defective, so we will see
B00412YT8W|5|Fit truck very good and works great
B0017Q6EEW|5|Nice exhaust tip happy with the look. Fit perfect on a 4&#34; pipe. Arrived on time.
B00FB82C6G|5|wonderful product, very happy with this item!
B0012ILZAS|5|nice and loud
B0031BIWX2|5|Works great.
B004RNR9QY|5|hose works perfect
B00VSB80E8|5|These are awesome sun shades! They go on very easily with the suction cups. They easily twist open and closed and also come with a very convenient carrying pouch. I love the patriotic flag theme. They are very nice quality and seem very durable. I have not had a problem with them falling off the window, they work perfectly. They do keep my car cooler in the Texas heat. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000C57NGC|5|Worked perfectly. Exact part I needed.
B00BOVDCPE|3|Its serves perfectly as far putting it on and taking it off is concerned. But one time maybe due to heat or bad road, it just fell off. So that might be an issue. Also mine makes vibration noise when going on rough roads. So I just put tape all over to make transponder and clip as one unit and stop the noise.
B003AKNUJ0|5|You get what you pay for with spark plugs. If you don't want to pay as much for platinum plugs, plan on replacing them sooner. If you haven't changed spark plugs before, it's an easy diy project on most cars. Just make sure to get a spark plug socket (these plugs fit a 5/8&#34; size spark plug socket), some anti-seize paste (I like ceramic) and dielectric grease (currently using msd spark guard). Took me about 30 mins and saved $150 versus going to the dealership.
B00RBC51EA|4|Got a go kart working but even though it is the correct model it didn't feel like it was putting a ton of power out like before but I have a feeling the old carb was off a bigger engine, this actually had a stainless steel bowl unlike the one before which I like
B004I1BC04|5|Perfect! It showed up on time and looked fantastic! I installed it no problem, and it definitely passed inspection. I would totally recommend this!
B000CAXI9I|5|the belt is great quality and arrived quickly.  the only issue is that Amazon stated that this fit my 2004 mustang GT 4.6l SOHC but it was way too big.  it does fit a supercharged shelby mustang but NOT the GT.  I have since returned the item because it was incorrect.
B000CIFVN6|1|Tried it on several doors that were squeaky and it didn't do a thing to them. Thought it might need another coat a few days later so I tried again and same results. Ended up buying a can of WD-40 and that solved the squeaky doors issue immediately. Don't bother with thus product, save time and get WD-40.
B00A8GCOVY|5|Perfect fit much better filter than what I bought at my local auto parts store. Shipping was fast price was great.
B00IXW0H3W|5|Great product great price shipped fast
B00332HMGM|5|great product to add Satellite Radio to your Mazda Car
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love this sunshade. I'm on my 2nd (after 6 years) but I live in Tucson AZ & it is NOT the fault of the shade - simply the brutality it has been subjected to caused a seam to rip. Easy to use, fits well in my 2005 Hyudai Sonata, and does its job. A bargain - and my dash & interior still look brand-new. An excellent product.
B004IKPUL2|5|works great !!
B000ED8KTG|5|as orderd
B001UHHMRG|5|THANKS I LOVE IT
B013VAL2KM|5|wow they are really bright like day light i love them i will tell every body i know

B007GB3H9C|5|Love HK!!!
B00FSDNDTY|5|Excellent work. European version.
B001O0GAOA|4|I Like it But I did not like the Idea of having Hook and loop Tabs left on my Headlights when the covers could not be used.
B000CESQZU|5|Bought these here on Amazon due to price savings. Great Quality Gasket set. Worked as expected!
B002QBNH9W|5|assuming restrictors are removed you should be able to hit 40 easily like i was doin with this carb and a good spark plug. i weigh 180. i was getting 45 at times especially when ducking below the wind that hits your face to force aerodynamics in your favor
B000BPUTDW|1|don't fit the base of valve cover it hangs out under the edge and they are very thick
B004I0KIDW|5|My husband had it installed in a few minutes. The matte black part isn't an exact match to passenger side light but since I paid $20 and it will now pass inspection I'm happy. I drive a 2001 S80 for reference.
B00KLZCVGU|3|Its ok for basic code retrieval and turning off the CEL. If you think you can trouble shoot or get detail info your in for a surprise. You have to buy a scan tool that is capable of real time information retrieval. You will spend about $250 for one Not $10. Save the ten bucks and go to Autozone, they do it for free
B000CIXMIC|5|Peefect fit. Best price. I used a cheap Chinese knock off intake ($174) on the 03 GMQ. That knock off one wouldn't really line up right. I had to force down one of the thermostat housing bolts.<br />For $146 each, I bought these 3 dormam intakes and put the first one on my 03 Town Car and the other one on my 01 Crown. Both fit perfect. I bought another one for my other 03 Town Car.<br />For the $$$, you can't go wrong.<br />To get to the left rear fuel rail protection plate bolt, it's faster to just take off the entire windshield wiper motor housing. It's a 15mm bolt.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this intake.<br /><br />Just un bolt the two 10mm bolts that hold the EGR valve to the throttle body.<br />These old vacuum lines are brittle, just unplug them and put them out of the way.<br />Unbolt the throttle body and keep all the cables hooked up-simply lift the throttle body up and move it over to the side.<br />Pop the fuel injectors up out of the intake, simply lift the whole fuel rail up and over with all 8 injectors still hooked in to the rails.<br /><br />The hardest part of the whole job is that rear left fuel rail protection plate bolt.<br /><br />The job takes me about 5-6 hours and I've done 3 of them so far.<br /><br />Just follow the torque sequence and make sure the top of the head is clean. All of mine sealed up nicely.
B000C5I2YO|4|its ok
B00AWPHRPE|5|Yet to test but 30 mins to install tested and works flawlessly!
B002PH0E1Q|3|So I purchased these in March 2014 because they are far and away the cheapest coil packs you can buy and they did the trick and fixed the stutter / misfire in my 2006 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer edition.  so that is the good.<br />The bad is that they only lasted about a year and I had to order them again (July 2015).  They all pretty much failed around the same time. Oh and there was a delay in shipping which they apologized for but then when they did ship out my new coil packs they sent the wrong ones.  I finally got the correct coil packs and everything is right as rain again.<br />You get what you pay for, these are dirt cheap and won't last as long but at this price you can replace them every year if need be until you can afford better quality.
B009DIW40Y|5|Fits perfect
B011R1NWF0|3|Works great just too big for my side light assembly very bright

B004FKWTSM|5|Was reluctant to purchase without trying it on first. But it turned to be exactly what I was looking for. Nice quality helmet and it was here almost immediately.
B00TAIRRMW|4|Haven't had a chance to experiment with it much. I think I can make do what I want.I like it. Rich
B00O8CJ7XM|5|Added a nice touch to an empty space.
B00SS3SGJI|5|Very sturdy on my car window.  It has not peeled. I love him!
B00FGKGJ40|5|As a youth I had a small auto detailing service, and remain an enthusiast when it comes to maintaining, enhancing and protecting my cars' exteriors. This JetSeal Sealant is in a word, excellent. It applies easily and is simple to use. The finish it produces is extremely reflective and offers that deep wet look that enhances any car's surface but especially if you have a pearl paint finish. I'll have to report back in a few months time as to it's durability. Like many cosmetic processes, a key is the initial prep work before using a sealant like this. You'll find it most effective if first you do a thorough wash and dry, then clay the surface to pull out any environmental contaminants lodged into the paint, followed by a polish designed to remove oxidation. Only then should you use a product like this or else you'll only be sealing in degrading and dulling contaminants. Personally, I like to follow this process with a layer of carnauba wax to give the surface even a deeper shine and ... Read more
B005H12BUO|5|Excellent for the price
B011C9IP9U|5|Starter works well, no instructions for wiring or installation.  Had to bore large hole with grinder and tread bolt holes. No bolts were included so had to buy those.  HOWEVER, once installed it is very nice and works well!.... this isn't' a project for anyone without some skills.  Good to have a wheel puller as well.
B00KQBJN88|4|Great helmet for kids.
B00ZPNJ9J0|4|Not Harley brand plugs, just plugs that FIT a Harley.
B001O01CZC|4|I bought two of these to go with a broken tail light and I was very happy that I did since my old circuit board although not broken was corroded and I am glad that I was able to replace it at the same time as installing my new tail light.  A good buy.
B0089PK8PA|5|I like them a lot they work really good thx
B00SM46I48|5|Easy to install and i liked how it has different settings on the twist length. Before i installed it i had to twist the throttle a good 2 inches, but with the multiple settings on this throttle i can twist about a 1/2&#34; and im running wide open. Its good strong materials and looks good too.
B00H1IBKIK|1|could not us them but they said they would fit my car
B000B6CW7M|4|its ok
B00CJH9QFC|5|Awesome!  High quality sturdy cargo carrier!  Had @300lbs on it for a 500 mile trip, and it didn't budge once!
B0023V7CI2|5|Perfect fit.  Timely service.  Great price!
B005QBMYJI|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 F-150!!
B000H2BPKK|5|money well spent
B000LEPT5G|5|For under $20, this is a fantastic product.  It read the code (P0304) and cleared the check engine light.  It then indicated that the I/M monitors were resetting as well -- since I cleared the code.  Waiting for them to go back to ready status now to make sure the original misfire issue has indeed been resolved.
B000E63LCE|5|worked great, stopped the stalling problem in a 93 mustang.

B00L7FC9JW|4|I like this item a lot better than the accordion sun shades. I am very satisfied and would recommend this item to any my friend.
B007PVIARW|5|Works
B0014URZF8|5|Great stopping power, kind to rotors, long lasting and no black dust. Ticks all the boxes.
B006B28A94|4|They work great and my pig of a bike, Honda VTX 1800R stops on a dime. They are a bit noisy when applying the brakes though. Sounds like cicadas when hitting the brakes. They don't squeal, just hiss like a cicada.
B00JF0LPAU|5|Good helmet
B008427D88|5|wonderful oen part
B000CITK8S|5|Working exactly as expected.
B00KWK0CCO|4|Works great so far - replaced my keyless entry case for my 2003 Toyota RAV4 (the little plastic ring that holds it onto the keychain had broken).  The plastic is definitely lighter weight (cheaper) than the original, but hey for just $5 I don't mind that at all!
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I needed something to store my purse when friends ride with me and this works just fine
B009EVP4ZW|4|Lock could be a more heavy duty, but the box overall is practical especially if you go topless.  This is the passenger side, I have the drivers side as well listed somewhere else.
B001PHBD3U|1|did not fit car
B00OCIC3JW|5|Works great for keeping stuff from getting stuck in the seats
B001KOG75M|4|Good product
