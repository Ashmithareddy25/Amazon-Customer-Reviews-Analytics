B00J8NDGOM|3|This game is alright, I guess. It would be a lot more enjoyable without the time limit. I mean, I understand the concept of being fast-paced, but with this game a sense of urgency, I feel, really detracts from the gameplay experience.
B0051QIGP4|2|purchased this... but struggling with being able to download the items... I work in the IT dept at my work and it isn't an issue on my end....
B005CRQ4GU|5|I read many other diary of a wimpy kid, but none are as good as the third wheel. I love how greg is  a kind and likable person
B0078ZTWP4|3|First, I give this lantern 5 stars for illumination.  The brightness is more than efficient to light up a room.  Second, I deduct 1 star because of the difficulty of attaching the base to the battery compartment. Third, I deduct 1 star for the unnecessary continuous blinking of the green LED light.  It is very annoying.  There is no reason for this feature and I assume eventually it will use up the batteries..  If you cannot locate the lantern in the dark then you have a problem.  I purchased this product for the primary purpose of using it in the event of a power outage.  Because of the constant blinking of the green LED light, I keep the lantern unplugged because it may be months before there will be a power outage and I can't stand the constant blinking.  In the event of a power outage it is going to be very difficult to attach the base to the battery compartment especially in the dark.  They should get rid of the blinking and improve the base connection.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Great game although I wish it would regenerate power quicker but overall very addictive actually boyfriend/fiancee mad I'm playing but what can you do
B00000AFGM|5|This is Manson's best album yet.  Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings  about things that affect all of us.  He constantly is reminding us that  drugs do run our society.  &quot;The Dope Show&quot; is the best song on  the album.  But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson  constantly screamed his lyrics.  This happens only a few times in  &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;.  I particulary like the song that has a  70's sound and backup singers.  If you are looking for variety from one  artist, Marilyn Manson is your man? woman? mannequin? Who knows and who  cares!
B0010SKTRA|5|I started with the &#34;Universe Within&#34; but now wish I had read  the &#34;Inner Fish&#34; first, which is more tightly argued. The discussion of how paleontology, comparative anatomy and recent advances in evolutionary genetics mutually inform each other to create a new understanding of how life evolved on earth is fascinating. Structures are not thrown away but &#34;repurposed&#34; at all levels.
1583334386|5|I am a psychotherapist and hypnotherapist specializing in helping people get control over unwanted habits.  I often read and blog about books on habits, motivation, and willpower. The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal is one of the best, along side The Compass of Pleasure by Dave Linden. While Linden explains the neurochemistry of habits, McGonigal cites the relevant research on the behavioral aspects of habits - as well as the tactics that diminish bad habits and maintain good habits.  Her instructions, based on a univerisity level seminar she teaches, are ones any of us can apply, even though some of them may seem counter-intuitive. Want to know why diets don't work?  Read Chapter 9.  Why does relapse occur? Read Chapter 4.  If you need extra help to stop smoking, read Chapter 7.  One of the best books you'll find on the psychology of self-control.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Uniquely funny- my amusement felt sick at times, I mean, who laughs at a cancer book?  Green was spectacular in capturing what it must be like to be so young with such a dire fate. Wow!!

B000002U3P|5|I only saw the movie recently, only hearing that it was one of the strangest, most obscene, and overall one of the most important films ever to come out of the U.K. Indie scene. &quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; is what I  thought. I'm a fan of indie films, but something about the concept of  heroin junkies didn't strike me. I finally saw the film, and I was taken  aback by just how lewd and oddly humorous the film was. I loved it  immediately! Part of the reason was because of the music. This soundtrack  is one of the must frantic collections for a film I've ever heard.  So-called Old-timers like Iggy Pop and Lou Reed on the same album with  '90's techno beat masters Underworld and alt. rockers like Blur, Pulp, and  Elastica, thrown in with some '80's dance music from New Order's classic  &quot;Temptation,&quot; and Sleeper's cover of Blondie's  &quot;Atomic.&quot; Sounds like an odd mix, but it worked. Somehow all of  these songs interspersed with each other (in the same order in which they  appeared in the film no less...I checked) work perfectly to convey the  emotions of sonic daydreaming and intoxicated ecstasy the film had. Iggy  Pop's &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is a wonderfully fast-paced anthem that  kicks off Trainspotting with a bang that shows just how much of a punch a  &quot;sincere honest drug habit&quot; can give the brain before shorting  out. &quot;Nightclubbing,&quot; also by Pop, is also a wonderful slow pump  that one could get high to, but also gives '90's music fans an idea of  where the beat to Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Closer&quot; might have been  inspired. Only one of the two Underworld songs from the film was put on  this CD, while the other had to be put on the dreadful second soundtrack.  Nonetheless, &quot;Born Slippy&quot; is a great song that starts out slow  and sad until kicking into a heavy pounding bass techno beat. Brian Eno's  song, &quot;Deep Blue Day,&quot; to me was unnecessary in both the movie  and the soundtrack, but...hey. &quot;A Perfect Day&quot; by Lou Reed is  also a bit of a sad song, sending chills down the listener's spine.  Leftfield's &quot;A Final Hit,&quot; Bedrock's &quot;For What You Dream  Of,&quot; and Primal Scream's ten-minute title track are also welcome  excursions into '90's techno and electronica, while Elastica, Blur, and  Pulp provide some sombre alt. rock moods, all of which give a sense of  fading Generation-X angst. The lounge feel of Pulp band member Damon  Albarn's &quot;Closet Romantic&quot; provides the humor to close the album  out. The album is upbeat and danceable, but amidst the pulsing beats is a  misery that compliments the film's characters' drug habits and the dreary  excuses of lives they lead. Great stuff! Get this album!
B004MC8CA2|4|I love this app!  I get a new Bible verse to start the day.  The search feature locates scriptures when I can't remember where to find them - which is too often, unfortunately.  The only thing I would like to see added is a way to save the bookmarks and notes to the SD card or someplace so I can restore them to my phone.  Every time my phone has needed to be replaced, I've lost all of my bookmarks and notes.

B0000033IR|5|The unedited version of \\"Chain of Fools\\" with the haunting blues opening makes this CD worth buying by itself.  But wait, there's more.  The hits fit well together with the lesser known songs; this CD may end up in my top ten of all time (I may have to drop a Beatles album because of it).

B00DR0PDNE|5|I had been eyeballing a Chromecast ever since it came out this past summer, but I was hesitant to buy one because I've purchased electronic gizmos like this before only to be let down. And those previous products that made &#34;broadcasting&#34; promises were much more expensive than the $35 price point on the Chromecast. Yet still, I waited to get one...waited for the reviews to come out.<br /><br />I received a Chromecast for Christmas (it was on my &#34;list&#34;) and it was the one toy I was both excited about and not let down by. After all the Christmas hustle and bustle from the morning had settled down, and half the house went down for a nap, I took the break time to get my Chromecast out of the box and install it. I can honestly say that it took all of 5-7 mintues to setup...seriously. I had the thing broadcasting off of my Tablet (Galaxy Tab 3.0) two mintues later to my TV (Sharp 32&#34; LCD w/2 HDMI ports); then I had it broadcasting off my Laptop (HP Presario) 2 minutes later; and finally off my Desktop PC (HP SmartTouch) 2 minutes after that. It was very easy and it works...like a champ, it works!<br /><br />But here's the one, tiny catch to it all...you must install the Google Chromecast App on all the devices you wish to &#34;cast&#34; to your TV. And, if you are wanting to broadcast off of the Web, you must use the Chrome web browser. And lastly, Google has not yet made a Chromecast App for the Galaxy Tab 3.0, which means that while I can broadcast movies, music, et cetera, I CANNNOT broadcast anything off of my Chrome Web Browser. But that's it...and that's nothing compared to what this thing actually does.<br /><br />Now I can watch anything from my web-based systems on my TV. For me, that's a big deal because my Wife and I enjoy catching up on shows that we may have missed the first time around. And there are websites out there that cater to our way of watching TV (i.e. CouchTuner). The only time I watch live broadcast TV anymore is for sports...everything else is from my DVR and now from the Web!
B004J4WKUQ|5|I'm a senior woman, and I know nothing about video games or that world, but I found this book to be really entertaining. It was funny and fast moving, and it opened up my mind to the world of virtual reality. The book also had a lot of heart. I highly recommend it!
B001ANSS5K|5|Amazing!!!!!! Couldn't put it down!!!!!! =).
B000089CKH|5|'Let Go' sheds Nada Surf's nerd-rock image and transforms them into truly talented songwriters. The album isn't without some flaws, Happy Kid, Blizzard of '77, and Fruit Fly all harken back to their 'Popular' days. Truly great ballads are intermixed with some great up-tempo songs. Also lost was a lot of their tongue-in-cheek humor that is great the first time but makes for a short shelf-life. It's been replaced by truly vulnerable lyrics about love, relationships, and life. Standout tracks include Blonde on Blonde, Inside of Love, Paper Boats, Neither Heaven nor Space, and my favorite: Killians Red. Buy this album now, it will not disappoint.
B005KJJ4F8|4|I had thought I might stop reading this book, but after about 5 chapters i couldn't put it down! Much more than a futuristic Cinderella story! Very intriguing plot twists. I will be reading the entire series! A must read!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|3|While I knew what to expect (I watch Famiy Guy and American Dad all the time) I guess I didn't consider the time. While the 30 minute TV shows are funny, the hour long movie kind of dragged on for me.

B00HDMMISA|5|Another good story by LIane Moriarty, with interesting characters with all the complexity of real people. I found myself totally immersed and it doesn't get any better than that for me as far as a good book goes.

6305252521|4|The main character in The Truman Show is not Truman, the character played by Jim Carrey.  The main character is really Christophe, played to ultra-pretentious perfection by Ed Harris.<br />As I watched this movie, it  slowly dawned on me that Truman represents the 'real people' that media  types talk about (as if they are not real at all), and that Christophe  represents the people who think they create the reality that regular people  live in.<br />I suspect there is a huge undertow of anxiety in the media elite  as they become increasingly estranged from real reality while they create a  marketable, pseudo-reality for us all. They know that they, like  Christophe, are not God.  Some of them, like Christophe, are terrified that  we will find them out.  And some of them, like Christophe's assistants, are  terrified that we won't.
0061122416|4|The book started out a bit slowly, but then I couldn't put it down. It had a very unique story line.

B005IZLPMY|4|Marvel movies rarely get better than Captain America: The First Avenger.  The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.  All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is a supremely enjoyable and just plain awesome superhero film that is more than worth your time and attention, and it does a fantastic job at making us all forget about that early 90s schlock-fest with the rubber-earred suit.
B00000016K|4|I wish Cream could have had their material produced with today's technology. Sometimes even the studio side sounds like it was recorded &quot;live&quot; with no final mixing. This CD shows the individualism of  Cream that probably led to their demise. Listen to the CD three times (not  in one day!) and focus on each part. There are none better with each of  their parts. The musical input that Felix Pappalardi can't be overlooked.  Listen for his additions to the studio side. Some of the songs would be  dead without it. It's hard to believe that this music is 30 years old. I  don't think I want to see a reunion of Cream -- I prefer to remember them  as they were.
B00E1LQ7Q0|5|Love the CD's. They arrived in excellent condition.
B00GH75V1S|3|More violent  and more swearng than necessary to convey the story. I will not buy the movie, nor will I watch it again.

B0089LOG02|4|Historical information presented through fiction.  Though heartbreaking in its realism, it is interesting and very well-written.  Glad I read it.
B0022Y570K|5|great music, great band, recommend it to anyone and I do not even listen to hard rock music, something about volbeat that has a great sound
B0000CDLA7|5|I enjoy listening to this record. It may not be their best, but it is a damn good one. I can't await to see them perform this live, possibly with some of the classics (Master Of Puppets, Number Of The Beast) and some of their own true masterpieces like Learning To Live, SFAM or ACOS (if you know what I mean you're worthy to continue reading this review ;-)).<br />The production is awesome, the singing is quite nice (I'm pleased to hear that James LaBrie doesn't has to scream is lungs out on this recording, it's all in his live range).<br />If there's one thing I miss, then it's the weird parts they had on SFAM ... this is 70/30 Metal/Prog., where SFAM was 50/30/20 Prog/Metal/Classical.<br />I'm entirely confident that the next record will again be completely different ...
B00L9B7IKE|3|dark story- was better by the end but didn't like the format.
0743243153|5|A great book that takes the reader on a journey through the perspective of a Psychiatrist. This is truly a road less traveled.
B006VRDZ44|3|Just average for an HBO series.  Will watch entire show over the coming weeks though.
B00LU0XO3O|5|I haven't used it yet, but I hope it's as good as I expected.
030796664X|5|I was wary, but encouraged by the reviews, I picked up the audio CDs for my commute.<br /><br />People seem to think of the first few chapters as the meat of the book, and as far as introducing the principles, they're right.<br /><br />But when Duhigg carries those principles forward to Sports teams and Corporate culture turnarounds, it's pretty valuable as it shows how these things scale up to a macro level as well as a personal level.<br /><br />Duhigg is also refreshingly realistic about the applicability and difficulty of changing habits; how it varies from person to person, habit to habit.  I did go in to this looking for the quick formula. But the more I listened, the less sense a silver bullet approach made.<br /><br />I wanted to take notes to pursue mentioned authors, but really had no way to do so as I was listening to this during my commute.  It is good enough that I'm now going to buy the hardcover as well, so I can fill it with post-it notes.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Not the usual nonfiction tripe that's out there.<br /><br />I will ding it a little bit for the voicing which is for the most part pretty solid. But the dramatizations of quotes from interviewed people is comically hokey. It doesn't detract from the presentation enough to ding it even a half-star (if I could.)
B00A6CCF0K|4|Stephen King develops his characters and tells a great story. Although I thought the ending could have been bigger. You kind of knew the outcome.
0307944689|3|This book and the official guide to TOEFL are good books but they are too big and heavy. They're not made to carry on.
B0000248L0|5|This gem had only one trouble: it came in 1990, when trahs was already losing its force, and when its pioneers like Metallica and Slayer had already ripped the benefits.<BR>Also, the uncapacity of Jeff Waters to keep its singers made the band lack a solid indentity with its public.<br />But \\"NEVER NEVERLAND\\" is marvellous, the bes trash than can be created!
B000I3UMKM|5|It seems to me that Breakfast at Tiffany’s is one of those films that everyone has seen.  The iconic Audrey Hepburn look, the Johnny Mercer song, Moon River, and the class of old New York.<br />I had read the Truman Capote novel but have only seen pieces and never the whole movie.<br />On a cold winner day, I decided to take the plunge. The movie is about Holly Goligtly (Audrey Hepburn) whose safe place is “Tiffany’s” department store. With all the glamour and glitz, nothing bad can ever happen there.  This movie takes you to the early sixties where there was still a sense of style and glamour.  The party scenes are fun and the story cute.  This girl is trying to make it and break free from a forgotten past.  Doesn’t hurt that her love interest is a neighbor writer who is played by a very young George Peppard.<br />Breakfast in Tiffany’s is one movie everyone should experience.  Wilson Trivino
B00HGJ18C2|5|Good graphics
B000SP3DE2|5|Outstanding. Frightening. Entrancing. Could watch again and again.  Special effects remarkable.  Story line spellbinding. Each character is unique to the story line and the way they are intertwined generates a movie that maintains your interest.
B003THHIEM|5|I loved it.  It is funny.  I will be purchasing all the seasons. I can not wait.  I highly recommend.
B005DKLPQ0|5|I'm not going to review the albums, if you are considering this set then you already love them.  The most important thing is that the remixing and remastering on these albums are incredible.  Johnny hit it out of the park.  I have been listening to these albums since the day they each came out and heard things in the new mixes I had no idea were there before.  Sounds buried in the original mix have been brought out to the light of day and we are all the better for it.<br /><br />The only thing that could have maded this set any better would have been if they had included a bonus disc with all the albums in instrumental form. Nothing against Morrissey, its just that as I get older it's Marr's music that has stood the test of time more than Moz's lyrics or singing.  Great set though, get it if you are a longtime fan.  Yes, there is a song or two missing, but really no one cares about that except for the completist freaks.
B00007ELEL|4|I just now recently watched this film, and I can't believe I waited this long to finally see it. This is a really good film..very funny..and in my opinion, the best Coen Brothers film..(though there's still a couple I haven't seen yet!) The basic plot that jump starts the film is kinda silly, but its so silly its great..then the story just evolves from there..from things getting bad to worse for \\"The Dude\\" and his friends! The performance of Jeff Bridges as this \\"dude\\" is classic. And don't forget John Goodman as the dude's bowling friend and sidekick, Walter. As with most Coen brother's work..the dialogue is hilarious and fantastic..especially the interacting of Bridges' and Goodman's characters. I just can't believe that I've missed out on this film for this long! Definitely recommended to anyone that enjoys funny dialogue and unforgettable characters!!
B000SW4DH6|5|One of those movies I come back to again and again.  Both Ewan and Nicole surprise with their singing.  Baz, as always, gives you a feast for your eyes.
1476730628|5|I purchased this book along with a few other 'Management'. Normally I read 2- 3 books at a time. The Promise of a Pencil is one of the rare management books which I have read without putting it down. It races in its narrative style almost like a thriller and yet it makes you think on the profound yet simple lessons it conveys in each of the 30 chapters.<br />Who is the book for? Frankly it is for everyone. The message in this book is for the entrepreneur as well as the corporate executive and even for the student. This book breaches all barriers of age and profession with it soaring inspiration.<br />It proves simply that if one has the strength of purpose to make a dent in the universe and takes the leap of faith then the universe also aligns with one's purpose irrespective of who you are. Just Read it and get inspired to act
B00K8J3VCC|5|Slow to enjoy it . . but it all came together in a most satisfying story . . Almost a diary of life in that town . . interesting people , well described<br /><br />Liane gets to grips with daily living and her brave approach to Bonnie is appreciated .
B008673ZAQ|5|I loved this book and read it in one night! Loved that Eva was vulnerable and not afraid to show how much she loved Gideon. True romance novel! Gideon would do whatever it takes to be with Eva. This book is a great read and I can't wait for the next book in the series!

0375842209|5|&#34;The Book Thief&#34; is a story about a German girl during the bombings in her town in World War II. She and her friends learn how to get around, how to find food when the whole city was cut off from food supplies, and how to avoid the Nazis. It was an eye opening look into the non-Jewish world of ordinary working class people during war.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Very well written historical fiction. Enjoyed listening to this book on tape as well.
B000002IAS|5|Clapton's earlier adventures with Cream and Blind Faith may have covered the overhead for this album, but for the first time since he'd left the Bluesbreakers he was surrounded by musicians with a similar taste and capacity for precise, very subtle R&B.  Again he's playing with heavyweights in popular music, but all the pretense of a Ginger Baker drum solo has been replaced by the sincere effusion of Delanie & Bonnie Bramlett's vocals and the economy of guitarist Dave Mason, who had already orchestrated the mainstream success of Traffic's first two albums.  What is on show in the 42 1/2 minutes of this album is an ostensibly modest yet very rich and triumphant live performance, surprisingly so in that it was recorded well after Manson and Altamont had sullied 60's idealism.  Perhaps this album reflects the more lyrical and traditional forms into which such idealism would have to be diverted in the new decade, but for all that there is yet in Croydon in 1969 no need to stop dancing and singing along.  As the AMG review indicates, Clapton would take the core of Delanie & Bonnie's backing band into the studio to cut not only his first solo album but the equally precise and iconic blues-rock of Derek & the Dominoes.

B000V8I2QU|3|I've bought every Bruce Springsteen album since Darkness the first day it was released so I'm not a newcomer to Bruce. This is a great collection of songs. Bruce says so much here musically and lyrically, but I have to agree with so many other people that the production is terrible. In listening to this cd a few times in my car I actually considered whether I needed better speakers; until I put in another cd which sounded perfectly fine. I listened to the album online last week through my cheap PC speakers. I loved it and was looking forward to listening to it in high fidelity. Apparently this will never happen unless a remastered version of this comes out many years from now. I find that this cd can not be turned way up without horrible distortion and it is actually tiring to listen to this for long periods of time. Great - a Springsteen cd that I can't crank up and listen to repeatedly. Contrast The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle (which was released a mere 34 years ago) with Magic and you'll find you're now waist deep in the Big Muddy.

B000VLOKQI|5|Amazing Journey is candid, frank and sometimes unflattering to the members of the Who.  Townshend and Daltrey are artists, and as such, didn't get in the way of the producers by forcing glossed over accounts of their 45 year career.  Since the death of John Entwistle in 2002, Townshend and Daltrey have stepped back from the egos that fueled years of fueding, and gracefully acknowledged their collective pasts.  As a Who fan, you must buy this.  There are 4 mini docs (6 total) that explore the musical contributions of each band member from an academic stand point.  The feature on Keith Moon's drumming is especially enlightening since most people think he was an undisciplined player, with no idea what he was playing.  After watching, you will understand he was probably a savant, besides being self-destructive.  The doc on Daltrey is equally enlightening.    The sound quality is amazing, as all tracks have been remastered and actually have audable bass!

My daughter was very leary about this due to the violent content but with discussion and teacher encouragement she loves this book and is so excited to also attend the play in Minneapolis this week with her 7th grade class.

B0032UYFA6|5|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is currently struggling with \\"Deadwood\\" for the spot as my all-time favorite TV show -- no making a final judgment til the end, though \\"Deadwood\\" was killed prematurely, so it may not be fair even then. And I never thought I'd ever see a show that could rival \\"Deadwood\\" for sheer violent brilliance. Whatever my final favorite, BB must be ranked very, very high amongst the best TV shows ever aired. The dialogue -- the use of music -- the editing -- the cinematography -- the acting -- every award is well deserved.<br /><br />Watching the transformation of Walter White from milquetoast to murderer, a man discovering, and loving, the darkness within himself, is fascinating. These kinds of stories always fascinate me, but here, it's exceptionally well done. It's so mesmerizing as the roles of Walt and Jesse reverse across the course of seasons. Jesse is, at first, the loser meth-cooking f**k-up, Walt the unappreciated genius chemist who's trying to provide for his family. Gradually, Jesse becomes the unexpected moral anchor. He's done terrible things, but unlike Walt, he's bothered by them. Walt, on the other hand, becomes addicted to the power he discovers as he makes himself into a drug kingpin.<br /><br />There are so many other reversals as the series progresses. Marie from bitchy, uptight kleptomaniac to truly caring sister. Hank from clownish buffoon to tough but sensitive, sharp yet somehow blind DEA agent, always so close to the truth (what a great character -- I'm glad Aaron Paul got his Emmy, but so should Dean Norris!). Skyler from nagging housewife to terrified half-hostage. And peripheral, but still important, Saul Goodman from flashy arrogance to battered-lawyer syndrome. Gus Fring from polite businessman to ruthless throat-cutting drug lord.<br /><br />I can't wait to see how this series ends. I'm p-o'd that we have to wait til next July for the conclusion. I am glad, though, that V. Gilligan is concluding this -- it's not a story that couldgo on indefinitely -- and I will trust him to make the right moves -- he's made very few wrong ones thus far.

You get to see a little more of Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and how his relationship with Hannibal went from one of trust to one of utter contempt & loathing.

6305428050|1|With all due respect to the director of Adventures in Babysitting, Chris Colombus, he helped create one of the most racist films in American cinematic history.<br /><br />Is it well crafted?  Yes.  Is the acting okay?  Yes.  Does it move along?  Heck, just like a windup toy.<br /><br />But please consider the plot:<br /><br />A white girl (Elizabeth Shue, lightyears from her work in Leaving Las Vegas) is baby-sitting several white kids, when she gets a desperate phone call from her white girl friend.  Why is her white girl friend desperate?  Because she is stuck in a downtown bus station, surrounded by (gasp) African Americans!<br /><br />Naturally, Shue races off, baby-sitting kids in tow, to rescue her friend from this tragic situation.  Maybe she should have called Jesse Jackson first, eh?<br /><br />When Shue gets downtown, various amusing adventures ensue.  But how can it be ignored that each of the adventures involves meeting someone who lives in the inner city who is African American.  And every single African American she meets is a criminal.  There is only one exception: (are you ready?  'spoiler' ahead!): the African Americans who sing and dance!<br /><br />Colombus must have been very disappointed that Steppin Fetchit (who adopted that stage name as a joke) was not alive and could not appear in his film.<br /><br />There is one African American who helps Shue and who does not sing and dance.  (Spoiler ahead) I kept hoping he would turn out to be an undercover cop.  But, no, he was a car thief.<br /><br />It would appear that Mr. Colombus is not aware of any non-singing, non-dancing African Americans who are not thieves, thugs or crooks.<br /><br />The film is a disgrace.  Really.  The fact that it is well produced makes it even worse--it can not be written off as a cheapy done by people who did not know better.<br /><br />For anyone who has seen Mr. Colombus' other films, however, the racism of this film should come as no surprise.  \\"Home Alone\\" was set in a similarly all white world (there was a single African American with a speaking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).<br /><br />Even in J.R. Rowling's Harry Potter series, which devoted a great amount of time to racism issues (between 'muggles' and magic practitioners, a brilliant symbolic foray into racism by Rowling), Colombus managed to dilute her anti-racism message. Look at the first two Harry Potter films, which he directed: multi-cultural England in Colombus' hands becomes an almost entirely all white country.  Only after Colombus leaves the series do non-white actors get a chance.<br /><br />This film should not be praised.  It should be held up as an example of cultural bias and racism.<br /><br />I generally do not write negative reviews, but this film has been given a 'free ride' for way too long by American film critics.  But they are the same critics who praise 'Gone With the Wind', a four hour film about the civil war which does not once mention the word 'slave'.  The racism of 'Gone With The Wind' has been ignored by most reviewers.  It took a long time for me to realize how racist it was.  When I first saw it as a kid, I thought Scarlett O'Hara must have been a wonderful employer! I assumed that Scarlett must have had a wonderful dental plan for her African American employees, to keep them so loyal!aking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).

1451648537|2|I do not want to dissuade anyone from reading this book but I find myself infuriated with the author for losing the opportunity to findout what Mr. Jobs was actually thinking and feeling about events. In over 2000 pages, on my iPad, I still don't have any insight into how the subject felt about and interpreted the same events as others. Despite interviewing Mr. Jobs, the author fails to give the reader what it was I was looking for, the inner mindset of this man. All the information given is a great history book on the evolution of a company and all the vicissitudes and complexities that centered around this guy, it would have been nice to share with us Steve's take on all this, especially now that he is deceased. What a shame to not give him a chance to interpret what everybody else is saying about him. The author is obviously an accomplished historian and for historical purposes gets bogged down in minutia. Similar to his other books, he is able to recount events rather than personal discourse from the individual he is writing about, as all the others were dead when he wrote the books. We'll never know what Ben Franklin or Steve Jobs was thinking when they made history.

B00MO21WUE|4|I am absolutely crazy about Dowton Abbey! I have all four seasons and watch them so often that I can quote what it is going to be say by one of the characters before it is said. So I looked forward to Season 5. As soon as it came out I, of course, bought it and waited until my day off from work to watch it. What a disappointment! Season 5 lacks the quality of the four previous seasons. The characters seemed less professional and credible and more lackadaisical. I still like the show and will continue to watch it and buy subsequent seasons. I just hope the next season is better than Season 5. I don't really know, since it seems they are getting rid of Tom. The best part of that show was to get rid of that awful, disrespectful, and crass teacher, Ms. Buntin. All in all, though not as good as the four previous seasons, I'm a die-hard fan of the show.
B00UENHBAU|5|I think this is a really fun game. Especially with the camera audio and ventilation errors. But first you need to the 1&amp;2 games. Both are also fun.
B001F0WXY0|5|Simply the greatest Sci-Fi book ever penned.  If you haven't read this book, what's been stopping you?
0316069906|5|This is tough stuff. It is by no means easy to read about the cruelty that is inflicted on animals within food factories. And as hard as it is to read about, it's important that this information be made public, and something is done about it.  The book is presented in a somewhat unconventional structure, and the most compelling section is the story of going undercover into the factory.  Strong research.  The section on turkeys right before Thanksgiving was devastating. The part that hit me hardest was the  sadism of some of the workers, particularly with pigs.  On another note:  Foer starts the book with the words \\"When I was young...\\"  which was interesting, because, in many eyes, he's Still young. Not that that means anything in the case of the book-- it just seemed an interesting comment, especially from someone lambasted in the past for \\"being young.\\"  That aside: the book is recommended. Although there are some funny moments, some is really hard to 'look at'. but hopefully it will help to change people's behavior and buying habits with food (even if you don't go vegetarian, but can be aware of who and what you're supporting), and help change a most important and often overlooked avenue of industry, life, and suffering.
B00B23O97Y|3|Let's face it, the dude's getting old.  Both he and Paul McCartney recently releasing albums that would make my grandfather smile.  Every once in a while Clapton throws you a bone (a bit of a guitar riff), but for the most part, this is pleasant background music, nothing more.

389508459X|5|I have read all of Austen's works and &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is one of the best.  I could usually feel for the main character, Fanny Price, and relate to her.  By loving her cousin Edmund so completely, she suffered greatly when Mary Crawford drew his attention and admiration.  I would have been rather angry if I were Fanny been left sitting alone for a whole hour while they walked through the woods. Mr. Crawford's love of Fanny rather surprised me, because he didn't deserve her after flirting so mercilessly with her cousins.  I was a glad that there was a happy ending.  I believe the most satisfying reads (like those by Jane Austen) always have happy endings.
B006ISJQ1W|5|The movie is great, a totally Johnny Depp experience. I love the actor, so am a little biased. But all in all the movie was a good experience. I got prompt service from the seller.. and am very glad that this went well. I am always satisfied with my Amazon purchases, they are prompt and just like they say they will be.

B001GAPC1K|4|The movie is great. The special features are great.  It's absolutely worth every penny if you enjoyed the film.     I am, however, extremely irritated that Amazon decided to ship me someone's used copy of the disk instead of a new one.  The copy I received had a cracked case and the plastic cover on the case looks like it's been left in the heat too long (all of the other blu-ray movies in this shipment were in perfect condition.  The disks themselves were fine, no scratches or even fingerprints on either of them, but for someone as OCD about their movie collection as I am, this is really irritating.

0385535147|5|John Grisham has a reputation for legal thrillers with compelling plot twists that make each one a literary gem! This novels concerns an unjustly imprisoned African American lawyer who uses his contacts as a jail house attorney to, not only free himself from an unjust imprisonment, but, also to enrich himself beyond most people dreams, while at the same time, giving government prosecutors the identity of the true culprit to secure an ironclad conviction. The legal process, small town values, and career challenges, are all brought up here, as is the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding the national drug trade. the political machinations of the FBI, and US Attorney office, as well as the prison system, are also explored, and there are some travel commentarys on some of the more affluent areas of the US, and some Carribean Islands. All in all, this is one of the best Grisham novels I have ever read !
B002ZG97EC|5|Great Fun
B0081SRJSY|3|The game seems okay so far but the computer is slow and talks to itself even with comments and animation turned off.  Also the only expansion is Rivers 2 and it would be nice if they could add in a few more to make the game more interesting since it seems like the AI's overwhelming strategy is to keep human players from scoring instead of actually trying to score for itself.<br /><br />The one nice feature is my wife and I can play it on my tablet as a &#34;travel&#34; version since the real game takes a lot of space and with a few expansions overruns the dining room table.
B00006GA4C|5|Some records stand the test of time; others don't.  Grand Funk's Red Album passes with flying colors and a bass lick to the gut for good measure.  This record, their second and finest, was recorded in only two days during October, 1969.  It's as live as a studio record can be.  Indeed, on \\"In Need,\\" you can hear Farner stop playing guitar, then start playing harmonica, then stop again before coming back in with his guitar The band is in a groove throughout.  This is simple but powerful music.  Now, I've heard some critics talk about the band's lack of proficiency on the instruments.  No, Mark Farner wasn't Eric Clapton.  But then Grand Funk weren't aristocracy.  They were a blue-collar band from Flint, Michigan.  More importantly, they played together well and their sound was good.  Besides, Mel Schacher was a monster bass player.  I cannot say enough for the sound of this record.  It reminds me so much of the sound of live rock bands from that era.  Standing near their speakers you could feel the thunder of the bass and the crunch of the electric guitar.  So it was not only an aural experience but a physical one too. The music hit you in the middle.  That sort of sound seems to have been lost, either by technological development or by fashion I'm not sure.  In any case, this recording captures that old sound well.  The new CD version of the red album also includes two bonus tracks.  \\"Nothing is the Same\\" is labeled a \\"demo\\" but is sounds like a pretty fine song to me.  Also a bonus is an extended version of \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\".
B004LROUNG|4|The book held my interest but there were a few slow spots. Good storyline.

B006INDMEE|5|The Debt is one of those rare films that depicts covert operations in both a believable and exciting manner. There is little if any need to suspend disbelief. The film portrays the emotional and physical tolls paid by a small group of Israeli operatives during (and following) a European mission. The acting is outstanding, the story is entertaining, and the subject matter is serious. If you enjoy relatively realistic spy thrillers like Body of Lies and Munich, then you will love the Debt. Though it is serious and realistic, it also has a good amount of action.
B00EMXBDMA|5|This book had me on the edge of my seat all night. It would leave you thinking one thing, and surprise you with another
B00DRPVE3M|1|This is a super fun game, as uno always has been. However with that being said the downsides to this game make it nearly impossible to play. It is overrun with adds and has limited gameplay unless you pay for tokens. You can look forward to playing two games before you have to wait 45 minutes to scratch another card that will allow for one more game, wait 45 minutes, adds, repeat. Fun game but should have one or the other, limited gameplay or adds. With both it is two thumbs down as it does not add to the original game but distracts from it.
B002LK3DUQ|5|Good product
B000FC0V3E|5|I have come across wide and varied responses to this novel.  Some positive, some indecisive & some negative.  Those who criticize this particular work, say things like: \\"But it's not about anything.\\"  Or \\"Nothing actually happens in the story.\\"  This is not cheap escapism for mindless hacks, this literature at its finest.  This novel reveals Hemingway's sublime gift as writer.  If you cannot recognize the beauty and skill in this work, then I suggest you do not attempt to read his other books either, you won't like them.
0618135871|4|Great Little Novel.  Roth's choice of First Person narration makes this work all the much better.  David Kapesh combines age and experience to give a balanced view of both himself and the world.  Don't let the title throw you.
B008ULRY78|5|Finally an over the top action film! A realistic premise that allows for the development and exploration of a savage violent confrontation.<br />This film delivers in the bullets and bare hands fight scenes. Finally knife fighting is shown in its' true barbaric reality.<br />This absolute high testosterone, manly man film shows what happens when an SWAT team is sent in to deal w/ hardened criminals.<br />Finally the question of \\"What would real combat look like when men are actually fighting for their lives?\\"<br />At some points, over the top and unrealistic but overall very satisfying. This film delivers! I am curious what other films these fellow have made.
B00HY7VU60|4|2 down and 7 more to go.
B007PTJOV0|5|I really like this game.It is one of the best games I have ever had.It works reaaly good with Kindle Fires'.When I start playing it is hard to stop.That is why I give it five stars.It is also very easy.I highly recommend it.
B00006399Z|5|I owned this record (and I still do although it's a bit scratched up) back in high school.  One of my all time favorite live albums.  The CD sounds great.  I would rate this as the my all time favorite Traffic album.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is awesome! You have to run away from the security guard after you were spray painting a train. There are many power ups like  a magnet, a jet pack, super bouncy shoes and more! You can get a mystery box which gives you tokens to get other characters. You can also get money and trophies from it. This game changes frequently. Last month the subway surfer was in NYC while this month is in Rio. Fro a month there are special characters you can get and new hover boards. Hover boards are like skate boards hovering Adobe the ground. If you will not die if you have it on.<br />  As I said, this game is AMAZING, fun, great graphics, and is almost like temple run. Except you must swipe you finger instead of tilting it.<br /> Pls take my advice and get this game. (It is free)

B0035J6TAI|5|Original Review (4 star review): When I was considering whether to buy this album or not, I went through reading various articles discussing the release and I was generally expecting to be unimpressed and, as much as I hate to say it because I've found many if not all of Peter Gabriel's albums to be brilliant in their own way, disappointed...long story short, ok shorter, I ended up buying the album and having only given it a single listen, I find it to be much more interesting and engaging than I'd expected.  I would not give the album 5 stars and in no way is it the best work (though we must remember that the album consists of reinterpretations as compared to original scores) ever put forth, but I'm not unhappy that I made the purchase.    Updated Review (5 star review): Now that I've had time to listen to this album many times and in two different formats (cd and vinyl), I can honestly say that this is one of the most brilliant albums I've heard recently.  At this point, I find myself unable to stop listening after setting up a single track, it really draws you in (if you are focused on listening, of course).  The sound quality of this album is absolutely astounding :)  Great work by Mr. Gabriel and his team on this one and I'm really looking forward to the next release!!!

B004H4XI5O|5|You know you've been smitten by a book when you find yourself babbling to a friend about it.  I've caught myself doing it a few times over the past week.  I've just concluded my fascinating two weeks with the Audible version of Josh Foer's book, which is capably narrated by Mike Chamberlain.  The spine of Foer's tale is his deep dive into the world of memory athletics.  In a very Plimptonian twist, Foer enters the US national memory championships in 2006.  His outcome, however, is very non-George Plimpton.<br /><br />Along the way, Foer girds his tale with fascinating detail about the history of memory, how brains work, and memory techniques like the memory palace and the PAO (Person-Action-Object) method.  Fans of 'Sherlock' will revel in the memory palace sections (see the last episode of Season 3).  We see and hear, too, from the world's leading memory athletes.  Foer befriends them in the course of his research.  The surprise: these aren't individuals with prodigious intellects.  They're the first to admit this fact.  Instead, they're excellent practitioners of these memory crafts.<br /><br />I guess I can call myself a fan of the Foer family.  I've read and enjoyed brother Franklin's [[ASIN:0061978051 How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization]] as well as brother Jonathan's outstanding debut novel, ([[ASIN:0060529709 Everything Is Illuminated: A Novel]]). What did their parents put in the water? It's working.

I enjoyed reading it and cannot wait for Hollow City to come out. I read this on a long car ride and could not put it down even after we got home. I recommend this book and hope people will give it a chance even though it has a...different cover. Remember; don't judge a book by its cover.
B000127LW2|5|This Star Trek towers above the rest! Putting in great storyline instead of boring technobabble every 5 seconds. Steer clear the super trekk geeks though, they try to bash it every chance they get. But don't worry, they are just making up for the lack of lives they have with their ignorance. This is X-Files meets Star Trek. Don't miss it!

B000NA2BEU|3|Was not properly completed in the final series of the dvd, and skating on to the 4TH which appears NEVER to have been completed.
B00ATDOVNK|5|The puzzles are fun and  can be challenging without being frustrating. Plus the added hidden object games are a great addition. Put that all together with the story line and you have a good fun game.
B00AREIAI8|5|perfect gameeeeeeeeee I lovvveeeee itttttttt.  filling in blankkkk space.. but game is really good. get money if rate app lol lol lol
067443000X|5|Found this book to be well researched and very insightful.  Purchasing additional copies for family members.  Well worth a read.
1451627289|5|I usually tend to be wary of Stephen King books, since so often they start off very well and then veer too off course for my liking.  I kept expecting that diminishing return with \\"11/22/63\\", especially given its length, but this book was simply captivating.  While the main storyline does clearly revolve around time travel and changing the course of history, the book's underlying tone is a reflection on how different the world was in 1950s, and despite all of our progress today, it doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I enjoyed the set-up to the rest of the story, with Jake's trip to Derry, Maine, and even more so, I loved his time in small town Texas, meeting all the characters and being touched by their genuine kindness towards one another.  The only part of the book I liked the least was when Jake/George is doing his final research on the General and Lee Oswald. While very critical to the story, I missed the small town folks he left behind and felt the story dragging a bit.  This is only a minor quibble, since the story picks up once again and brings it all together.   I also applaud King for the conclusion of the book, which could have ended in a variety of disappointing ways or been a cop-out to avoid any explanation of everything that happened up to that point.  Instead, King's conclusion is explanatory, realistic (as much as it can be), and sentimental.  After investing all the time to read the entire book, I was happy to close the book entirely satisfied.   This is by far one of the best books I've read in years.  I recommend it to anyone who can suspend some disbelief by indulging in the \\"What if?\\" of time travel and contemplate what it would be like to have lived a different life.
B000TGJ7ZY|5|I love vampires, werewolves, and love romance films so this movie is very enchanting. Gary Oldman is a great actor.

B00VXGTJMU|5|loved it
B005ZOBNOI|5|Simply beautiful.<br />Like John Lennon said,  \\"life is what happens when you're busy making plans.\\"  To notice the beautiful simplicity in each moment, not always rushing to get through the day, but embracing it.  The greatest gift in life is to love and be loved in return.
B00NWLIW0E|1|I won't let me get it I really mean is it won't let me download<br />that's why I give 1 star
1444710338|3|Great product. I will order it again.
B00005YW4H|5|I love this album.  I had this years ago and it was lost so I'm so pleased to have it again.  Norah Jones is an absolute favorite of mine.  She sings with such feeling and depth on each recording.  The whole collection of songs on this CD are outstanding.  You will enjoy this for years - it's timeless!
B004RCUJ9E|4|A decent game, challenging as the levels progress. But I found that it ran in patterns, so it was easy to beat as you discover those patterns.
B007PT3QOQ|4|fun game but run out of energy fast.  It is a good way to pass the time.  You can get bored quickly with the lack o energy.
B00AEJM6H2|5|Love the game, has many challenging levels. Is good for both children and adults and also like the different designs too.
B00DMCV7K0|4|As a daughter of the south, this's book, as The Secret Life of Bees, took me back to the South Carolina of my childhood.  My great grandparents were slave owners and I went to their church in the early 1960s and spoke loudly about racial equality. Thank you for your love of the South as well as a condemnation of its history. I truly understand.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game it is so fun I could play it all day best horse game ever amazing!!!  My horse is the best horse game I've found and the best part is that it's free

B008Y7N7JW|3|Had heard about it so I watched to see what the hype was about.  It was alright.  Had I known more about it before I watched it, I would not have watched it.
B00MG4RIXU|1|Choppy disc won't work on either of my blu ray players and the digital version doesn't stream cleanly either.
B004SBS8LA|5|amazon app store posted on Facebook that the update is here....... so where is it?  I feel like I'm waiting forever.
B003SNKBXW|5|I read this book because I loved the movie so much. I enjoyed reading this book but I was hoping to explore the darker elements of the occult and I was really hoping for more of a dark twist at the end. However, I did enjoy the book and I learned a lot about the work of Dumas which was unexpected. There are elements of action and suspense throughout the novel but there could have been so much more at play in my opinion.
B0002F6BRE|5|We continue to be excited to view this movie over and over! The fantasy is delightful, yet the characters are those with whom we can relate.
B0089LOG02|4|Not knowing about the &#34;Orphan trains&#34;, I was interested in this aspect of American history. The story was riveting until such time as the main character reunites with  a former orphan and a romance follows. I thought this a bit corny, however, the author then takes this relationship to a gritty level and returns to a convincing conclusion.
B00DR0PDNE|5|What an amazing little guy! I am able to cast just about any thing, including streamed movies from over sea, local contents, etc.  Its is a most smart way to obtain the best entertainment without paying big sum of money! Will buy another one for the other big screen TV. Thanks Google for this great creation!<br />PS. Make sure download Avia to your device. Only costs $4.99.
B00BR476TG|4|Good movie too long, but metaphors and story line was tremendous, left you thinking about life and the struggles.  What it looks like if we endure to the end and overcome the struggles.
B008Y2FRFO|5|This is a very fun game and addictive
B00E9PMMX0|5|Christmas Gift!!
B00P42WROG|5|One of the hallmarks of a good author is the ability to keep you wrapped up in their story. I really enjoyed this story!
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Lives up to the high expectations expected from Jeffrey Archer's Chronicle series!  Can't wait until 2015 for book 5 of the series.
B0025KVLVA|5|Great Buy! Not a significant change from '87 to today but still great packaging  & detail.....
B0000507UD|5|It is now ok to be the real, mature immature, stupid rude jerk that is actually how everyone feels but never had the self confidence to be.  Yeah, no stupidly sappy sad serious drama-get over your parents and be the rude jerk that you honestly are-I can sing &quot;yeah&quot; to that song better than any lyric in anyother song anywhere.  Yeah.
B0052RE4MQ|5|This book is a thrilling adventure story that risks life or death and it adds a little bit of romance here or there! I thought that Ally Condie couldn't have created a better book, but she never ceases to amaze me. If anything, I couldn't put this book down! If you like the Hunger Games, you'll love Crossed.
B00CWVG1Z8|5|Great movie!
B006VRDZ44|4|Not sopranos but good watching.
B002AWX6UM|4|The thought that is impressed upon my mind the most is to never ever ever ever give up on a child, ever.
B0017ANAZO|5|Very smart, well written, excellently written movie. Dianne English at her best!
B008Y2FRFO|5|This is a very addictive game. I love the prize sets, it adds a nice dimension to the game and something to shoot for.
0316098337|4|Well written. Makes you think about many things we take for granted, but still manages to be interesting and a page-turner.
B009YN2M7S|5|Another Nicholas Sparks book and it also, is wonderful book you need to also, purchase this book from Amazon.com now. I think they have a TV show now on called Safe Haven. I also have a granddaughter named Haven. How cool is that?
B0073RBQY2|4|The detail was nice but was hoping it would be a little more sturdy for my 3yr old
B007P6VLRS|1|This is not the Smashing Pumpkins. I am sorry, but when you lose all of the original members that helped launch the band to fame and were key to the overall energy and dynamic of the band, the band is dead.  What we have here is essentially a Billy Corgan solo record with the Smashing Pumpkins name on it.  Billy Corgan is trying too hard and its just not working anymore.  Many of the songs have no sense of direction, and sound the same.  And the production sounds overly digitized.<br /><br />I am sorry, but this is NOT the Smashing Pumpkins.  Its Billy Corgan with a rotating staff of different substitute musicians.
B0053YEM7U|4|Basically the guys from the Buggles had some left over tracks from back in the early '80's.  So they got a few members and added to those and Presto, a new-old album.  If you liked the Buggles, you'll like this album.  If you are more into Anderson, maybe not so much.
B00ICNXQ26|5|Fun little app... my son loves taking the little swimmer on his 'adventure'
B00SXK8R6S|5|The TV series is a great testament to the books!
B00DUGCLY4|5|I think it's cool and fun to play I play this with family and I use it and it's a good game
B004GJDQT8|5|Amazon is the best I always think Amazon first ,fast accurate and never disappointing! Thanks again
0792843584|4|When self-appointed film experts talk about the worst movies of all time, Heaven's Gate invariably enters the conversation.  Until the release of Ishtar, this depiction of the Johnson County War in the late 19th Century enjoyed the dubious distinction of being the biggest box office flop of all time.  In my view, however, a box office flop doesn't necessarily denote a bad movie.  A bad movie is one with low production values, bad effects, and/or muddled script, like Plan 9 From Outer Space or Manos: The Hands of Fate.  Heaven's Gate, though it may have been a box office flop, is actually a very good movie that got it's undeserved reputation due to director Michael Cimino's obsession with perfection.  This resulted in multiple takes of scenes that most directors could have shot in one or two.  Ultimately, the picture cost three or four times its original budget to make.  Negative pre-release publicity from a reporter who managed to get into the film as an extra after Cimino refused to grant him an interview, and the critical shellacking that it received from the critics when released, conspired with the well reported cost overruns to doom Heaven's Gate before it was even out of the starting gate.<br />Personally, I like this movie.  And while I appreciate Cimino's insistence on period authenticity in such things as trains, costuming and sets but I have a problem reconciling it to a script that takes such artistic liberties with recorded history.  The real Jim Averill was a cattle ruster who along with his wife was hanged.  He was not the noble sheriff with an Ivy League background as portrayed in the film by Kris Kristofferson.  Nevertheless, Heaven's Gate is a superb motion picture in many respects.  The cinematography by Villnos Zsigmond is nothing short of magnificent, and the acting performances are all good, especially those of Kristofferson, John Hurt, and Christopher Walken.  Although many previous reviewers have criticized the sound quality, I found nothing wrong with it.  I also didn't find the plot all that hard to follow, as others claim.  Perhaps they expected the movie to give them a clue without any sort of thinking on their own.  Of all the complaints that have been levelled against Heaven's Gate, the only one I think that has any merit to it is that the pacing is painfully slow.  That said, I don't believe it distracts significantly from the enjoyment of the movie.  Incidentally, have I mentioned that David Mansfield's score (sadly, not in print) is beautiful?<br />Sure, Heaven's Gate is considered to be a flop.  But I would suggest to anyone reading this review that you watch it for yourself and decide.  It's really not as bad a movie as others have led you to believe it is.
B001A2ADFO|4|Has anybody noticed an issue with distortion on \\"i shot the sheriff\\"?  The rest of the album doesn't seem to distort but during the chorus of 'sheriff' I hear real distortion.  It's definitely not my speakers b/c I tried my CD and mp3 version, no distortion.  I've got a great system (music hall mmf 2.2 turntable, denon 4308ci, and klipsch xf-48s.  think it's worth contacting amazon about?
0670025593|5|best story line ever -- alot like all of the Harry Potter novels, and the Jennifer Lawrence movie series, but so well written!
B002U5HKZ6|5|Amazing read couldn't put it down the book that made me figure out out the Amazon kindle highlight pick it up!
0345803507|5|Reading the old fashion way is my kind of way to read. After book two I had to get my hands on Freed, still not finished but I was so happy to see it available on Amazon.<br />Thank you.
B009LH1Y1W|5|Rough season in their relationship, but the end of the season brought them full circle.  Loved the last episode and the richness of where it can go in Season 9.  Lots of funny episodes this season and those with Charlie/Felicia Day are the best.  But where was Garth?  Also, bringing back the character Krissy was awesome.  I hope to see more of all these characters - and Bobby in Season 9.  The Brothers need their extended family to really make the show work.  This was the roughest season yet, and I wasn't sure it would be worth it, but the later half of the season pulled it together.  The last few shows, specifically with Dean and Sam's relationship repairing were perfect.
B009CPES4I|4|Easy movie to w&agrave;tch
B00L47E6IA|5|Great CD.
B00J8CG6KE|5|You know, originally, I did not like Mr. Dicaprio, but EVERY single one of his movies NEVER disappoints! He is an amazing actor, and now, I know, I can &#34;bet&#34; on him, for the movie being a hit!<br />Loved it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Interesting read, gives a proper perspective on Jesus as a historical figure without all the religious rhetoric fogging the view.  It shouldn't be taken as an attack on religion, it is simply a factual view.
038572179X|4|Having seen the film first, this book afforded no real surprises in terms of plot. The language was dense and difficult to enter into for quite some time, and I had to force myself to keep reading for the first 100 or more pages. The characters were interesting enough to keep me going, but the action and the way it was told left something to be desired.<br /><br />However, as often happens with these types of styles, my efforts to finish the novel paid off handsomely. The prose, the imagery and the overall wording of McEwan really came to life a little before the halfway mark, and it really helped to bring the emotion out of the page.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Love in the Time of Cholera in the way that after a little while, no matter what is actually happening in the story, the words themselves start to affect you in strange ways. I felt myself tearing up at some parts that, if I explained them to others, I would receive strange looks. But as I said, the phrasing and the language itself, though it began the novel as a barrier, becomes the essential aspect of the story.<br /><br />The film and novel are both fantastic, and though their stories are almost exactly the same, the way they are told make them both worth a look.
B00AREIAI8|5|Good app to have when you are bored, I play it all the time, and the graphics are nice too.
B005GFPZYK|5|Love the honesty of how Chris seen the war and life. Gives a person insight to just how much a military person gives to our country.. gives his life and the happiness of his own family to protect and serve. God Bless Chris, his family and the USA!!

B004EPYZP8|5|This was a great movie that kept me entertained from start to finish.<br />The acting was good, it has an all star cast...be a great gift for someone!
1250038820|5|Friends were delighted with present :)
B00GXKVZSW|5|Series is as psychotic and as I expected. the level of drama and intrigue is enough to hook me after just two episodes. Show is somewhat graphic but not overly done. Just enough to illustrate the mental state of the killer.
B001974DG0|5|Great book.
B00BATG18K|3|I chose the book because of the author's reputation and I have read her books in the past. I found this one way too wordy, she goes into details that I just skip over. I woulnd't recommend this book to just anyone, only a person who was a true Tan lover.
B005VGWT2K|3|George Harrison: Living in the Material World is a documentary by Martin Scorsese. The film is approximately four hours long, and since HBO doesn't allow folks to pause for bathroom breaks, delivered in two parts, the evenings of October 5 and 6. It was billed by Olivia Harrison, the ex-Beatle's widow, as definitive. She admitted that it was made, in part, to get the adulatory public off her (and son Dhani's) back.<br /><br />I suppose it's entirely possible to enjoy an artist, only to dislike a documentary or biopic about the person. This happens rarely; in fact, it's more often than not the opposite. It's revealing to watch films like Scott Joplin, where Billy Dee Williams played the very-unlikeable ragtime star. I liked the film. I learned a lot, through the filter of Hollywood storytelling of course, but these things are informative. Recently, I reviewed No Direction Home, Scorsese's documentary that reveals Bob Dylan's early years. I find Dylan to be an extremely unlikeable fellow, but I left the film feeling sympathetic toward him. Furthermore, I admired Scorsese's craftsmanship.<br /><br />The opposite occurred when I watched Living in the Material World. Maybe this is because I knew the story already. I've read a number of biographies about the guy, watched all ten hours of the Beatles Anthology, and heard most of the film clips. It was interesting to hear Eric Clapton's voice, as well as former wives Patty Boyd and Olivia Harrison. The usual cast was there: the surviving ex-Beatles, and their inner circle, as well as Yoko Ono, sitting in for John. We also got to see auto racer Jackie Stewart, Monty Python alumnus Eric Idle, and rocker Tom Petty.<br /><br />The story was banal. What stones were there left to turn over? The media have scavenged for Beatles trivia for the fifty years now, when they first landed their recording contract. We knew George wrote Taxman, and had a stereotypically Scottish obsession with hoarding money. We knew he was quite sour with Paul when the Beatles broke up. We knew he poured himself into Eastern thoughts and religion.<br /><br />Scorsese barely mentions Harrison's family. Is this out of respect to Harrison's privacy, or does the director just view it as irrelevant? I notice that No Direction Home pays no attention to Dylan's family either. I suppose I found myself wishing the film had dug deeper.<br /><br />The friends interviewed seemed to universally state things like \\"I wish I believed we were close friends, but I just don't know.\\" Even Clapton, who I always assumed was Harrison's closest friend, said this, as did Tony Stewart, Jeff Lynne, Eric Idle, and Tom Petty. It makes me wonder where the title came from. I assume because of his adherence to Eastern thought. Harrison himself marks Ravi Shankar as one of the most influential human beings in his life: \\"certain people can teach without saying a word. Ravi Shankar is one of those people.\\"<br /><br />Olivia said that one of George's greatest regrets of Lennon's 1980 death was that John was unable to leave his body in the way he chose. This was a predominant narrative throughout the latter half of the film. George says everything in life was a preparation for his moment of death, when he leaves his body. I suppose, in a way, this was my one discovery from the film: all life, for George, is a preparation for being ready to die. His thoughts were nearly borne out in 1999: the documentary devotes 10 or 15 minutes to Harrison's home invasion, when he and his wife were stabbed and nearly killed by a deranged fan. It made me think of the line from the Bob Dylan track \\"It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\": \\"...he not busy being born is busy dying.\\" I wondered if Scorsese noticed the similarity between the philosophies of his two subjects.<br /><br />The first ten minutes of the documentary were chaotic, in a rapidfire review of several songs and pictures, from current Harrison to old Beatles at their peak, to a pre-Beatles Harrison on a tape recorder. Cutaways in the first ten minutes were of video and still montages, songs, color and b&w. If I had not known Harrison's early story, I'd have felt a bit cheated, as the overwhelming amount of information being given me at once. I'm sure it was intentional on Scorsese's part. Every once in awhile, throughout the film the editing was startling: there would be several seconds of black, or moving from a song, to silence. I'm sure these effects, too, had some sort of meaning. It escaped me, and simply proved to be an annoying distraction.<br /><br />There were a few moments of joy and beauty. He loved his garden, and worked for hours on end, sometimes by moonlight. We find out that in the 1970s he gave up the sitar, when he realized that his medium would always be guitar; and there, he redoubled his efforts to pop music. We understand, from two or three new angles, the story of Patty Boyd, Clapton, and Harrison. Clapton himself refers to the Harrison home in Esher as Camelot, and to himself as Lancelot. Two or three letters home, to Harrison's mother, while on tour, were beautifully and touchingly read. Harrison's was the only family untouched by death or divorce. When Ringo told the camera Harrison's last words to him, a tear ran down the drummer's eye, as well as my wife's and my own.<br /><br />In well, it was a well-executed, if pedestrian documentary. The first quarter-hour was chaotic and confusing. It gave nothing new to veteran Beatles fans. I liked it. Nothing amazing.d still montages, songs, color and b&w.

B008Y6U5AM|1|Did not watch after about a half hour.
0307454568|5|This is a great read! I read all three in the trilogy. I think Stieg Larsson was amazing. Can't believe he didn't get to know how well received his books would be. The only trouble with the book is that you cannot put it down.
B00BAXFECK|3|Many aspects of this book were excellent--the prose, the story, the characterizations, the settings. Admittedly I'm an impatient reader, but I felt The Goldfinch was self-indulgent, going on way way too long in way way too many places. Since I read it on my Kindle, I have no idea how many pages long it was, but it felt like with about 100 pages edited out, it would have been a much better book--I would probably have rated it 4 if not 5 stars.
B0012HF5NC|4|A really fun escape movie, lots of action even though the outcome was a forgone conclusion.<br />It was just as good as Armageddon with Bruce Willis.
B00HCMG6LG|5|Very fun and addictive! Too short!! Need more levels badly!! Love the work on the ol brain muscle which is always a plus!
B003Y5H5BA|5|I really loved this movie. It has many scenes in which I laughed hysterically. It also has many lines that I'm sure will be referenced and quoted for years.

0679731369|4|Who would of thought some dead French guy from the mid 1800's could be so interesting?  I read this book on the recommendation of my brother but with the stipulation I read &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; first.  I have to agree with this suggestion.  Someone never having read anything by Flaubert would have a hard time understanding some of the glory of THIS book. Not so much a novel in the ordinary sense, but more one character's(fictional) almost irrational quest for knowledge about his favorite author.  The novel is filled with quotes, timelines, and factual anticdotes from Flaubert and his life--what an absolutely amazing writer.  I really don't want to give away too much because discovering Flaubert and his world view are the true joys of this book.  Just read it and enjoy!
B00NMPSQUQ|5|Remarkable of a icon and one of the best audio 5.1 no compression ever heard! the channel separation and a perfect job for a Sound Engineer directly from the master tape channels it really makes a fresh look from an old recording and the clarity of every instrument and voices make it perfect to listen in a nice system and also comes with the nostalgic 2.1 1984 original release with a clarity of a master tape good to listing on a nice pair of headphones!! just Superb!!<br />Denon 7.2 Amp<br />Klipsch (all 5) center, front, up, and rear speakers
B008AK8FHM|3|I very much enjoyed this book.  It has lots of scientific and factual information about the brain and neuroscience behind how the brain works.  Very interesting read.
B000JMKTLO|5|Excellent
0307341550|5|I loved Gone Girl, so I got this book and it's another winner, I love Gillian Flynn. It was a good read.
B0000AUHPB|3|You said it, Mr McVarish! I was sitting here on Nov 19th thinking I'll watch TIJ, with Caine, again: it's a really silly, silly movie. I must be psychic. You stole my title. Anyway, this is a ludicrous, ridiculous film, made up of a lot of little disconnected sketches which don't really add up to a full-scale drawing. If there is a theme or a moral, it seems to be that whatever kind of car you drive, you'll be seeing it coming down the mountain, sooner or later. The camera just loved those spinning, crashing, blazing cars, and couldn't take its eye off them. Irene Handl was a natural genius; and I believe she was just like that in real life. Benny Hill was a bit wasted. Truly, nothing much made much sense in this story. Characters came and went, popped up improbably all over the place. Like Caine in the prison toilet, or Coward in Harley Street. And what about that Fred Emney? A genuine one-off character. Pythonesque, is what I say. But everything is redeemed by the magnificent, brilliant, unique and unrepeatable ending. I can't think of anything else to say, since I've run out of ideas.
B005MVJM3I|5|I was NOT a Machine Head fan prior to this release. I loved their version of the Iron Maiden cover for Hallowed Be Thy Name but was not able to get into anything else by them. Then I heard Darkness Within on SiriusXm and decided to give the album a try. No regrets!! This album is unbelievable from start to finish. The solos are amazing, the guitar tone is classic metal, vocals are incredible. I can't say enough good about this disc.
030746363X|5|I had heard great things about this book from my brother who has used it as a gold standard for feeling good and to maintain a healthy lifestyle for a few years. I have followed Times ideas and found them simple and straightforward.
B0002XDODU|4|I didn't like this album at first but I really do now. I'm a huge heavy metal fan and I liked the other three albums so much because of the riffs and heavy edge. This album has some rockers but the style is more orchestral and focused on melody. I say they pulled it off. The acoustic guitar on \\"Los\\" was a fresh idea and it sounds awesome! Very rock N roll. The title track is the anthem song, with the violins and all...pretty good. I thought America was pretty silly at first but its catchy in the weirdest way you know? The female russian vocals on Moskau adds another layer to the wall-of-sound that is Rammstein. Keine Lust is a heavy number and the video for this song is hilarious, the members of Rammstein  are all fat and jamming out...like obese! Kinda strange, but its not for me to know the meaning behind that. Overall, definitley not their best but I like it and its worth repeated listens, just like the other albums. Rammstein have proven they can make beautiful music as well as heavy. Great music.
B00I2X6TBG|5|Great Book - great movie.  I'm usually disappointed when I've read a great book then follow up by watching the movie.  I was not disappointed.
B00628SJJS|5|Well done. Excellent character development, makes you evaluate all relationships in a new light.
B00AFEYUVG|5|Great movie! Arrived right on time. No problems at all with picking it up and if you like getting emotionally involved in a movie this is the one for you.
1881273156|5|The 5 Love Languages is the best book on relationships I have ever read.  It should be mandatory reading for every couple and not only will it help or save your marriage but it will also help you understand your parents and  how they expressed love to you as a child.  I have read over 100 self help  books in the last two years and this is by far the best.
B00FR0PVSY|5|One thing about Lemmy and Motorhead, they just keep doing what works.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I keep loving it.  They haven't let me down yet.  Can't say that for most bands.
B0013TXA5Y|5|Loved this! Can't wait for the next few books! I definitely recommend this book to anyone with as little imagination.
1577314808|5|A MUST READ!!!!  MENTAL SURVIVAL.
0385504225|2|This book, while entertaining, is FICTION, yet it highlights the TRUE involvement of Masonry in the foundation of our nation.    While it is an entertaining read, as Dan Brown points out symbols, codes, and clues to the Mason mind set, his fictional story points out the seemingly hidden yet obvious intentions of secret societies. Secret Orders like the Golden Dawn, Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and others have all been infused with mystical cult ideas from Hermeticism.    (Hermeticism is a false teaching which includes both panentheism and Monistic-polytheism and it promotes the notion that other beings such as gods and angels, ascended masters and elementals exist in the Universe as parts of the All.)    Many false teachers promote the heretical Hermetical slogan, \\"As above, so below.\\" This occult teaching misleads people and gives them false hopes! One should read the Bible before reading this or other books like this to understand the TRUTH about Jesus, the universe, creation, and the gospel of salvation brought to humankind. This is quite a FICTIONAL STORY laced with TRUTH about secret orders, their codes, secrets, rituals, meanings and how they influenced, and continue to influence, powerful people in our nation and other nations of the world.    The final chapters of this book are Dan Brown's attempt to promote the New, (and old), Age philosophy of man becoming God. Dan uses quotes from the Bible and blends them skillfully with untruths. He tries to link all religions and science together as a path for man becoming God. This subtle infusion and intermingling of truth with fiction will, sadly, fool many people!    Jesus said, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\\" The way to heaven is through Jesus! Those who think they are becoming God, by using their mind over matter, to gain wealth, power, and position are only fooling themselves. Our only hope and salvation is in Christ Jesus!

6305426651|5|This movie is truly special.  It is sweet, touching, inspiring, and sad.  You will smile, you will cry.  The inner beauty of the main charachters shines throughout the movie and even in the midst of a major tradgedy you cannot help but feel warmth in your heart for power of true love.  Beautiful film!  BRAVO!!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

B00A6VAW9W|5|Having been a loyal fan of Loggins and Messina, I just couldn't believe when an old disc jockey friend emailed me with a link of some LIVE Blue Sky Riders  April 2012. I was blown away by their backstage, warm-up harmonies. I started to watch the tour schedule and jumped on the chance to see them perform the now available CD LIVE last September. If you were ever a fan of the likes of Poco, Loggins and Messina and even America, you are just going to love this band and their first CD. They sing together like they have always been together. FINALLY....new music for me.....and I thought I'd have to stay stuck listening to oldies.
B0002858YS|5|I can only hope the next album comes soon. I'm dying to hear the Killers--their sound is similar to all the other bands you've heard, such as Ferdinand, but wait! Do these songs actually sound like something I'd want to listen to? Instead of the crap the Ferdinand puts out? Yes! Why, the Killers have forumlated such amazing tunes that I can only hope Ferdinand and the others catch some of the genious, too. Long LIVE the Killers! ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|2|I got through about 3/4 of the book before stopping. I just couldn't take the whiny characters anymore. The author built up some intensity in the beginning, keeping the reader interested in finding out who the murderer was and how the stories were linked. But pretty much after that, the story deflates completely. The female characters become, in other words, totally unbearable, as you read about them being unnecessarily indecisive. One of the characters who was cheated on--oh my god, I wanted to smack her. Or her stupid kid. Or just smack everyone.<br /><br />At least the hot cross buns sounded appetizing. :-/
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Fun beach read. You really don't want to put it down until finished.  Good ending, good plot, I would recommend .
B00005Q4CS|5|So there I was-sitting quietly in my seat staring at a black television screen.  I did not move for about 5 minutes.  The power of this movie overwhelmed me.  Darren Aronofsky creates a 5 star-film with all-star performances, based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s compelling novel.  Masterfully put together, this movie is classed amongst my Top Ten list of Best Films of All-Time.  In fact, it is #1 presently.<br />The film's depiction of drug-abuse is overwhelmingly accurate as far as what drugs do.  But never did they really say what drug it was the four characters (Harry, Marion, Sara, and Tyrone) were using.  Drugs seems to be the device used to both promote and steal each of the entity's `dream,' thus the dreams of the four were already doomed from the beginning.  It was as if the drugs themselves were teasing each one, giving them the instant gratification they were seeking, then took everything away once they reached the a point on the road where it was too late to go back.<br />The musical score plays a significant role in the whole film's success.  Its bold and pervasive style composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet help establish the film noir quality.  It truly plays a role that strengthens the viewer's emotions and attentiveness towards the film.<br />First time viewers, prepare your minds for an explosive rendition of the effects of drug-abuse.  Starring classic legend Ellen Burstyn, the appealing Jarod Leto, the exquisite actress Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, generally known for his humorous films.  This is a film that will strike the eye, mind and heart.  Embrace yourself for a movie unlike any other!  And most of all, enjoy. :)
B0053O89WY|5|It was basicly like new. The cover and the DVD's were in great shape. I would get more DVD's in the future.
0374158460|2|I looked forward to reading Freedom with much anticipation; I had heard Franzen's eloquent interview on NPR, I had greatly enjoyed The Corrections, and I was impressed by the accolades the novel received. The first two chapters (which I'd read earlier in The New Yorker) are terrific--compelling and well-written. Alas, the remainder of the novel needed serious editing. It's over-long, abounds with characters who become tiresome, and is filled with sloppy language.    It IS possible to write a novel about contemporary life, and about any strata of society, that contains graceful , controlled language, viz. the works of Colm Toibin, Ian McEwan or Philip Roth. And it IS possible to write about middle-brow folks who enjoy a spiritual/imaginative dimension to their life. Again, I invoke the aforementioned authors.... Why, for example, are there no passages in Freedom in which Walter actually observes the warbler and is moved by its delicate beauty? Why don't we feel Richard's passion for music more fully?    And although I love \\"happy endings,\\" the conclusion to this book ties up the characters' lives a bit too tidily and happily.    Although Myer's review in The Atlantic is overly rabid, I agree with his contentions about the language and characters in Freedom.
B007IQX1G4|5|I loved the movie.  Very entertaining but dark at the same time.  Charlize Theron is easy on the eyes in this can you go back home, movie.  Worth the money spent as a video download.  Just learned that if you have the Kindle Fire you can download movies to it with wifi, then play it later.  Might have to buy one.

B00GP7E3SC|5|I have watched and heard Jennifer sing since her early days in 1994 at Eddie's Attic in Decatur. Ga.  I have enjoyed her many transitions from Soul Miner's Daughter to Jennifer Nettles Band to Sugarland and now on her own.  She has always been an amazing songwriter/singer who always seems to add a spiritual interpretation into her songs.  While I love her collaboration with Christian Bush, I hope she achieves the individual accolades she deserves..

B0000524CY|5|This is indeed is the scariest movie of all time. I have seen many horror movies in my time and this tops my list.  At a time when all special effects are done by computer manipulation, this movie is filled with many actual effects, which brings a certain reality to this movie and makes every scene seem like it was actually happening. All I can say is don't watch it alone!

1476746583|5|All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a beautiful written deeply metaphorical novel set alternately in Germany and France during World War II.  Unlike most WWII historical fiction novels this story does not revolve around Nazism or the rise of Adolf Hitler, rather it shares the struggles of survivors, children in fact, who must fight to endure and survive against overwhelming odds.  &#34;All the Light We Cannot See&#34; metaphorically refers to both protagonists, the highly intelligent German orphan Werner and the young French girl Marie-Laure.  Werner is enthralled by radio waves, science and energy transmissions that travels on &#34;all the light we cannot see&#34; while Marie-Laure loses her sight at age 6 and survives World War II as a blind teenager.<br /><br />Seeing the occupation of Paris through the &#34;eyes&#34; of a blind young girl helps readers feel an entirely need understanding of this time in our world's history.  As a reader I become wary when beginning a book that immediately strikes a main character with a such a dramatic tragic flaw (similar to the mute protagonist in Gibbin House by Carola Perla).  Marie-Laure suffering from blindness prohibited Doerr from using sight references when referring to her experiences but it is an obstacle he overcame with incredible ease.  Restricted from describing her experiences with sight Doerr focuses heavily on smell, touch and sound which not only succeeds in building a relationship between reader and Marie-Laure but also in bringing the reader into a full sensory experience of this tragic war.<br /><br />All the Light We Cannot See should quickly be considered a must-read book by any reader who enjoys WWII fiction, especially those WWII fiction novels that break away from the standard Germany/Nazi motifs.  Doerr simply succeeds in every single aspect of literary writing.  The dialogue is beautiful and the words are always spoken with a purpose; the characters are impeccable with obvious care taken to develop even the most minor of characters; and what is there not to love about a story that makes another classic story such an crucial plot device?  If you haven't read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne reading All the Light You Cannot See will make you want to quickly acquaint yourself with that book.<br /><br />This is a remarkable read and I can understand why it is becoming one of the most talked about books of the summer.  It is a bit of a lengthy book but the story is absolutely enthralling.<br /><br />Review by Ashley LaMar<br />Closed the Coverto develop even the most minor of characters; and what is there not to love about a story that makes another classic story such an crucial plot device?

B001OQCV2O|1|This blu-ray disc cannot be played on an HTPC (Home Theatre PC)<br /><br />I have an HTPC running Vista and both the WinDVD and Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 Ultra players. Both are up-to-date and likewise the Vista Operating System.<br /><br />When I trying playing the disc on PowerDVD I get a message saying \\"The menu for this BD-J content does not support use of a mouse\\". The content is unplayable because I cannot select the menus or the play function.<br /><br />WinDVD does not report the incompatability but does not play the disc either. The disc is unresponsive to the keyboard, my Cyberlink remote and the media keyboard.<br /><br />I am returning the disc to Amazon as \\"unfit for the intended purpose\\". If you have a blu-ray player you should be okay. Likewise I expect Playstation 3 owners are probably catered for. Clearly this is an attempt by the authors of the disc to cut-out owners of generic HTPC machines.<br /><br />This disc is made for Sony Corporation so I strongly suspect this is a deliberate, malicious attempt to cut out people using HTPC's. Please comment if you are having success or failure with your HTPC so we can get an accurate understanding of the problem.
B000000OSE|5|These guys were the best
B00N6PD3GE|5|Highly recommend this book. From passengers and crew of the Lusutania to the commander and crew of the U boat, the author paints an unforgettable portrait of people events leading up to this tragedy, as well as the political and human side of the aftermath.
B000059H99|5|Sometimes the simple ideas, when well done, accomplish as much or more that the elaborate plots, settings, and special effects of major epics.  The concept of \\"Rocky\\" was certainly a simple idea; a club fighter going nowhere gets the chance of a lifetime and makes the most of it.  The idea behind the plot is believable and the characters are fairly believable as well.  Sylvester Stallone does a credible job as the unknown boxer.  He is a likeable guy who doesn't take anything too seriously.  Even as a \\"muscle\\" for the mob, he tries to reason with his \\"clients\\" rather than do the work he was hired to do.  He has a thing for the sister of his friend and his style of romancing just adds to his audience appeal.  His eventual opponent in the ring, Apollo Creed, is an obvious satire on Muhammed Ali.  His flair vs. Rocky's \\"ah shucks\\" style also adds to the audience appeal.  Things meander until the fight draws near and Rocky starts to get a better focus on his training.  His workouts and the accompanying music help to get the audience stirred up for the main event.   <br /> <br />The fight is an interesting event.  Most boxing fans would regonize that the fight would have been \\"called\\" long before the final round.  We are not made aware, until later Rocky movies, that fighters can actually die in the ring.  However, we know that we are in a modern day fairy tale so why let such minor points distract us.  However, the beatings that each fighter administers on the other may have succeeded too well on the screen.  The excess just got worse in later Rocky films.  The ending of the fight helped, I think, to add to the power of the movie by keeping us focussed on the improbable rather than the impossible.  The music, the calls for Adrian, the rare humility from the champ all create a goose bump of an ending. <br /> <br />Rocky is a great film that I have seen many times simply because I always toss away the remote when I come across it on TV.  It stirs something good and positive in all of us.  Everyone of us wants to think we'll rise up to the occassion if lady luck finds us while we're just killing time.  Usually, when an actor creates a starring vehicle for himself, the result usually is disappointing.  Stallone can be proud of what he put together in \\"Rocky\\"  The disappointment and over-promotion comes from not stopping with just one Rocky.

So everyday when she wakes up, she's forgotten what happened yesterday.<br /><br />If you watch the Drew Barrymore's movie Fifth First Dates you'll have an idea of what this book is about.<br /><br />Why doesn't Christine recognize her own face? Because the last memory she has of her face is from she was young and now she is.... old.<br /><br />What would you do to remember who you are? Well, Christine is keeping a diary. For some reason, everyday when she wakes up she goes to this shoe box and finds her diary and reads it. That's how she knows she is not insane and can wave together yesterday's events to today's. Everyday, she adds that day's important events to the diary. And that is how she can \\"remember\\" who is whom.<br /><br />The problem? Christine is married and she is suspecting her husband... of something. What exactly she doesn't know but she doesn't trust him anymore.<br /><br />I was totally taken with this book. My mind can't just process how a person can live with short term memory or not memory at all.<br /><br />I was totally immersed in the story and found it brilliant. I hope they make a movie out of this book because it will really be a good movie.
B00004XPPK|5|The first film I ever saw starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, this 40s noir gem is just too hot and steamy for words!! Sure, the Production Code at the time prohibited any graphic or blatant sexual references, but the performances and innuendo more than make up for it.<br /><br />The rich black and white cinematography, wonderfully constructed sets, and Rita's dance numbers, as if that's not enough to take one's breath away. The strong, sensual heat generated between Hayworth and Ford is guaranteed to make you very hot beneath your collar. Was there ever a better portrayal of a sizzling love/hate entanglement?<br /><br />There is a hinted homosexual undertone in the relationship between sinister casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) and his right-hand, Johnny Farrell (Ford), but as soon as Ballin's provocative new wife, Gilda (Hayworth) arrives on the scene, that pretty much goes out the window. The priceless expression on Johnny's face when he discovers that Mundson's bride and his ex-lover are one and the same (amid the famous hair-toss), is a moment that just cannot be beat. Ballin becomes all the more evil and controlling, at first only to Gilda (sensing that she and Johnny knew each other before), but then his bizarre business dealings and plans begin to unravel, leading to a great plot-twist.<br /><br />Gilda succeeds in arousing Johnny's jealousy through her flirtations with other men, while he tries to keep her supposedly \\"indecent\\" behavior from the boss. As much as he claims to despise her, it is obvious that neither one have gotten over the hurt of their \\"past association\\". When Johnny has the opportunity to punish her for what he believes to be her sinful behavior, the sparks between them go up another notch. Those slaps that they inflict on each other (love hurts!), and of course, Hayworth's famous \\"Put The Blame On Mame\\" mock striptease (dubbed by Anita Ellis) - that one will linger in your head for a long, long time. And that silky black dress - I think I speak for all of the viewing females when I say, I want that dress!!!<br /><br />With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), \\"Gilda\\" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history.<br /><br />It would be nice to see \\"Affair In Trinidad\\" (1952) and \\"The Lady In Question\\" (1940), both of which paired Hayworth and Ford to have DVD releases. There's just not enough of their powerful chemistry to go around!!!r all of the viewing females when I say, I want that dress!!!    With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), \\"Gilda\\" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history.

0375815996|5|My daughter seems to like this book. Soft so I don't worry about her hitting her eye
B006LSZECO|5|I probably put down 4 out 5 books before I finish. If I'm not totally engaged and can't wait to pick it up again, why bother? Gone Girl is very well written and very engaging. I LOVE this book, and look forward to reading my next Gillian Flynn novel.
B0011ZNAIC|2|Out of all the Dreamworks' CG Animated films, this is probably the weakest (kinda interesting because the NEXT film \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" would be my favorite of all time). There's no comedy, no adventure, it's just bees talking to humans and humans being surprised by talking bees- *sigh*. I have only seen this once in my life and I barely remember that I even saw it. Jerry Seinfield is a bland boring uninteresting actor, the other characters are forgettable, Patrick Warburton is kind of funny, but he's an actor who have played in too many roles. The climax is boring and weak. Also the idea that bees can only choose one job and are stuck with it forever is just-terrible! For me, I can't find enough to like in this film. Personally, I'd skip this one.
B00280LYIM|4|I like the humor, the description of the world of the Olympians and range of characters.  This book more depth to the series and not just more of the same.
B002N44XSG|5|I loved reading a couple more stories about percy. Percy Jackson and the Olympians and heroes of Olympus are two of my favorite series after all. Uncle Rick's books are always amazing.
B003L77TZI|5|Fantastic album but I still prefer One Of The Boys. I loved all the tracks in this record as they are quite catchy and entertaining but in my opinion E.T should have been the lead single from this album or atleast a potential one. In conclusion it was a fantastic listening experience and very enjoyable.
B0009ML238|3|Yes these guys can play, but there is little here separating Circus Maximus apart from the hordes of Dream Theater and Symphony X clones out there.  I'm at the point when I purchase a progressive metal album where I want something new and original: Ark Burn the Sun, Redemption The Fullness of Time, Extol Synergy, Andromeda II=I, Zero Hour The Towers of Avarice.  I was really hoping The 1st Chapter was going to be something a bit more original, but after many spins it's nothing more than an amalgam of Dream Theater and Symphony X, and no it's not a covert rip-off, it's blatant theft!  You can take Symphony X's The Odyssey and any one of Dream Theater's albums and literally match up many of the melodies and arrangements with The 1st Chapter.  This is not a coincidence.  There are many bands that do the same thing, but for some reason Circus Maximus is getting praised for it.  Maybe it's because they are young and from Norway, but I'm baffled by the many people salivating for these rip off bands taking material from other bands, mixing it up a bit and throwing a different vocalist in the mix.  For Christ's sake, do something original!!!!!  If I want to listen to Symphony X or Dream Theater, then I'll listen to one of either band's amazing albums!  But that does bring me to the vocalist.  In my humble opinion, Circus Maximus' vocalist is exceptional, and yes, to the bands credit, they did write four songs (Sin, Alive, Why Am I Here and Glory of the Empire), granted they are hardly original in sound, that really accentuate his voice amazingly.  In fact, the only reason I even keep listening to this album in any capacity is because of these songs and the vocalist.  Guys, for this I'm giving your album three stars (2.5 to be exact), but I really hope you all come into your own on the next release.

B000000HU1|5|Every now and then there comes along some music that convinces me that when artists collaborate with like-minded musicians, they can actively and intentionally channel, well, something, call it a Muse if you will: Gong's YOU is one of those albums. <br /> <br />When I listen to this album in the right frame of mind I swear that there are whole passages of music that don't appear on the album at other times--maybe that's the Invisible Opera. Maybe that's why they call it \\"space music\\"--I dunno! <br /> <br />This album contains some of the finest instrumental work ever laid down: listen to Hillage channeling the Octave Doctors via his axe-work on the track \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\" and you'll know what I mean. Needless to say, this is truly a magic(k)al album that can permanently change consciousness. Thank you, Captain Capricorn et al!
6305807086|3|Being John Malkovich is a wonderful movie, and in my opinion justly deserved the &quot;Best Movie of 99&quot; from Roger Ebert, so the second it came out on DVD I picked it up.  While the movie is still great, I have  problems with this DVD version.  Firstly, the 16x9 Widescreen presentation  doesn't show up on DVD-Roms (sorry college students).  Secondly, the  special feature &quot;An Interview with Spike Jonze&quot; was so borderline  confusing that it makes you wonder whether or not to laugh at Jonze  vomitting in the street.  Basically, a great movie, but they could have  done MUCH better on the presentation and special features.

1572814349|5|This deck is a work of Art and was executed as such. It is not a bizarre mutation or some other attempt to push someone's personal agenda but is rather an tasteful expression of the blending of Art and Arte for its own purpose. The assembly of figures and symbols from different sources for collage is careful and well thought out. The blending of these images into seamless compositions is truly a treat for the eyes as well as for the Sight.

B00MU9R5OI|5|Love it!!!!!!
B000HKW7E0|5|One of my favorite movies and it never gets old!
B00004RFCM|5|Love sex in the city.  I don't like that it doesn't play all the way thru. It stops after each episode. Doesn't have a play all. But I believe it comes that way period cause it was the same way when I rented it years ago. In excellent condition.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is very fun it is like you are a farmer and need to take care of your horse this is the truth
B004QX07G4|2|This was for my wife, who is a big Ellen fan.  She was really expecting more substance, but all she got was a long winded monologue.  There's much love for Ellen in this house, just not this book.
B006YGC7KK|5|The show actually got better from season one to season two.  It's as good here as most action films, and better than many.<br /><br />I'm glad that the CW gave the show a shot, as other networks passed on it...so that those networks, I imagine, could air more reality shows and informercials.
B00HCMG6LG|4|Very time consuming but I like the challenge. I could play this game all day if I could. I plAyed this game until my kindle died lol.
B00MASEK74|5|This review addresses the first episode, not all of season 8, most of which is yet to be seen.  &#34;Deep Breath&#34;  introduces the 12th Doctor and explores Clara's adjustment to his change, was awesome and well worth the premium price.
B00BEOYPKW|4|I really enjoyed Kurt Vile's previous album, \\"Smoke Ring for My Halo,\\" so I was looking forward to this new offering. I like it, but I feel like I should have been blown away more than I actually was. I keep waffling: one day I think it's brilliant, a timeless work of musical genius. And the next time I play it, I find it hard to stay awake, thinking perhaps this is nothing more than a bunch of over-hyped aimless jams.<br /><br />I've played this CD a full 20 times now, and I'm still not QUITE sure what to think of it all. Certainly, Vile is a great guitar player, and the seeds for some memorable music are lurking in there, but too many of these tracks drag on for far too long. It's great that you get nearly 70 minutes of music on this CD, but I think this is one of those cases where less might have equaled more. At least I wouldn't nod off so often if the songs were shorter!<br /><br />So, is this a great album or an overrated one? I'm still sitting on the fence. But I'll keep playing it --- that alone should serve as some sort of endorsement --- and think about it all again 3 months from now.
0061122416|4|Rife with spiritual metaphors, this allegorical tale of a Andalusian shepherd searching for his Personal Legend is, for the most part, an affecting fable that allows the reader to extract from it whatever he/she can find that relates to the reader's own search for answers about Life.    I have seen it compared, in other reviews, to THE LITTLE PRINCE and JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL and understand the similarities to THE LITTLE PRINCE but feel that the messages inherent in each of these books are not the same at all; THE LITTLE PRINCE is a cautionary tale for adults about the danger of losing the \\"kid\\" inside, as it will make the adult jaded and focused on material goods, or shall I say, \\"matters of importance.\\"    JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL is definitely a closer match for THE ALCHEMIST. Both deliver tales of a protagonist who searches for that which few ever find. THE ALCHEMIST offers additional themes relating to business and travel and international relations, but in trying to capitalize on the BIG theme of pursuing one's God through self-discovery, Coelho seems to be far more heavy-handed than Richard Bach is (with his singular tale of a seagull as outcast who finds the ultimate in life's meaning).    I liked THE ALCHEMIST very much, but didn't love it like I really wanted to. I think that has less to do with my anticipation than it does with Coelho's didactic tone; I got a sense from the very beginning that I was to absorb this life-altering tale and think, \\"Wow! that was the most meaningful text I have ever read,\\" but I didn't. I feel the intention was pure and truly insightful until Coelho decided to weigh so heavily on the metaphor of alchemy and fulfillment and spirituality.    Perhaps my ultimate disappointment is with the crafting of this novel. It felt too manipulative, as opposed to a simple story that revealed itself to readers by allowing them to make the connection for themselves in a way that is special in a different way for each reader, instead ofhaving Coelho making the connections for us... repeatedly. If a writer has to continually explain the lesson because he/she doesn't trust the reader to find it, he/she, in essence, doesn't beleive in the reader. This is where I think that JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL succeeds more elegantly; though a bit preachy, Bach gets us to discover our own meaning more through the power of the lesson and Jonathan's internalization of it, than Coelho gets from the lecture or over-explaining by the teacher/guide.    But I did like it, especially the ideas presented before the introduction of Alchemy.     As an language arts teacher in the International Baccalaureate program, I am debating whether or not to require my students to read this book, or to make it an option. The reviews from past students reading it are decidedly mixed.
B00785P2QC|4|It is not sim city but for most part it is a good game. I enjoy it so far.  Still figuring it out
B004MC8CA2|5|It's so easy to become distracted by day to day life...Having the reminder setting for study or devotions is a great asset!
B001C4CI8U|5|I just finished the season and was blown away by the last episode!!! There were certain things that I was expecting that were proven in  the last episode with one major surprise that they didn't hint at very much but subtly told you about it. This is such an amazing show!!!
B008Y212PI|4|This is a fun way to pass the time. I actually must think pretty hard sometimes. Other times it's easy.
B002PQ7JQK|5|If you're looking at it then you know you're a fan. Go ahead and buy it. It's nice to watch both old and new graphics.
B00SI7GCJK|1|Watched it in its entirety to please someone who had watched it three times (can you just believe) only to find out it had been watched that many times to realize there was NOTHING to understand.
B00SCEET1M|5|very good We all Liked it
B000QRIGLC|5|This book was amazing! I felt as if I was there watching. I cried for the pain and loss Marcus suffered. I couldn't put the book down!
B008XG1X18|5|I love Pinterest. They have such creative ideas that you can save for when you have time to make them.
B00G5G7K7O|5|great gift
0920668372|5|Lovely.  Touches your heart.  Strongest bond is between a Mother and her child/children.  Also, the boy learns to be a man and a good dad to HIS child-from his mother.
B00BEK6Z7M|2|I don't understand the many positive reviews. Most of the book was somewhat superfluous and silly. The characters were caricatures, not in any way realistic or meaningful. The action scenes at the end are all pretty contrived.<br /><br />The plot was at first somewhat engaging, but then swiftly departed from reality. My first and last Preston/Child book.
B001L5YW9I|5|Fantastic cinematography captures primeval forests and world of eighteenth century colonial America. Wonderful chemistry between Stowe and and Day-Lewis. Fascinating, romantic story.
B00BEZTMWW|5|Being a huge fan of J. R. R. Tolkeins books I may be considered biased.  However, I think that Peter Jackson has done a fine job in bringing this prequel to the screen.  I can hardly wait for the release of the second part (&#34;The Desolation of Smaug&#34; to be released on 13 Dec 2013 A.D.) Like any film adaptation, the books themselves are better.  However, as with the LOTR trilogy, the changes do not ruin the story and maintain the &#34;flavor&#34; of Tolkein's original work.
B001B3MCQK|5|Think of a psychedelic, hispanic singer who channels Dylan, Jim Croce and James Taylor in a completely incredible way and you have an inkling of Rodriguez. He created this stunning music in Detroit in the late 60's and went undiscovered in America. He adds another chapter to Detroit's rich musical history of people like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smoky Robinson, Aretha Franklin, Eminem, Jack White, Anita Baker and Kid Rock to name just a few. It's sad that he had to wait all these years for recognition, but we get to experience an undiscovered gem from the 1960's which makes it an even cooler story. In my opinion, there is not one bad track on Cold Fact or Coming from Reality. This is music with wisdom, confidently told in a very engaging style.
1455582344|5|Thank you
B004MLWKMY|3|Works decently enough.  I thought an extra one would help guide my Roomba around more smoothly.  It did not help at all.
6305127638|5|The best Star Trek films have dealt with villains that we viewers have had some history with. Star Trek 2 had Captain Kirk battling with an old nemesis named Khan who had appeared on the old television series. The  villains in First Contact, the Borg, appeared several times on the Next  Generation.  The Borg are back with a vengeance in this explosive  combination of action and drama, and with this one, you don't have to be a  fan to enjoy it. Oozing with amazing acting, special effects and Trek-lore,  First Contact succeeds in bringing a long time villain to the big screen  with enough oomph to blow you away.
B00BZBQ4GW|5|Loved Jumanji. So much better the seoond time around. Highly recommend this movie.
B00MJD7AMC|5|A book I was constantly reading to the end.  Didn't like one part with a supposed sighting of Yeti. Gave a false ring to the whole story. Quite an amazing tale. I saw the movie which inspired me to read the book
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Very good game
B00005ATQF|5|I did not have any issues with this movie at all, worked fine... Love the movie also by the way
B000AMPZF8|5|Origin of Symmetry is my favorite album of any, ever.  The combination of Matt's perfect vocals and an amazing instruments performance by the three guys makes for songs you can't stop listening to.  I love every song on here.  The best are Bliss, Hyper Music, Citizen Erased, and Megalomania.  But none of them disappoint! Muse is the best rock group of our generations and this album proves it again and again.
B00SWWPVSY|5|Creative puzzle game. Lots of levels.
0142004235|5|I was really impressed by the characters and themes that Steinbeck drew and tackled in this novel.  I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese.  At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.    I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece.  For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends.  The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading.
B0044DEAUA|3|ok
B002RVZV9K|5|I have been playing Guitar for thirty years, and its awesome when you find something that is inspiring like this DVD. Its great to get insight to what these guitarist think in conjunction with the history and all the technology that is and was available to them at that time.  This is a must for any guitar player at any level. The producers of this show hit three generations of musicians (very Smart) and I am sure they were very inspired by it as well as the musicians who are featured in this DVD who were by each other.
1452110581|5|My new favorite book. I am an absolute cat freak and this is the cutest book I have seen in a long time.<br />Very entertaining!!
B00005V3Z4|3|Donnie suffers from a sleep disorder.  He often finds himself waking up in places he didn't fall asleep and his family is so accustomed to it that it's practically humorous.  Troubled teen takes new meaning when a demonic rabbit appears to Donnie and sends him down a road which will change not only his life but the lives of his community.  In therapy and on anti-psychotic drugs you are forced to decide whether the good Doc or drugs are helping or hindering.  Good Donnie or bad Donnie?  The decision shouldn't be a hard one while you waft through a parade of lifeless characters that seem to be gasping for breath only because it's second nature to keep trying.  A psychological thriller to say the least with some sci-fi thrown in for good measure.  A very interesting flick--not for those who dislike trying to figure it all out.  The official web site makes great use of flash but you'd have to watch the movie to understand it.
B007XKEY6Q|5|This is the first social game app I've ever used. It's a ton of fun! (and a good time waster ;))
B0098XY5VK|5|This game is fun.  My little cousin was playing and had to get off the computer and she wanted me to finish her game.  I couldn't stop.
B009CPJHY4|5|I watched it as a rental and loved it so much I needed to add it to our colection.  Worth rewatching with friends or alone with a bucket of popcorn and ice cream.  What a wonderful way to age.
0156528207|3|I purchased this little book to read to my 5 year old granddaughter.  It is far too advanced for her.  I don't think it would hold her interest at this time.  I most likely purchased the wrong version.
B00C2UUDMG|3|This is an enjoyable read. It is a very easy read so good for holidays, predictable plot
B009UX2YAC|4|My 10 year old loves this game it's fun and keeps her quite lol .so that's God for me .
B0000029DD|5|I only wish I would have discovered him and his wonderfully artistic music before he died.  I would have loved to see him in concert.  He is amazing.  My daughter, who is a music teacher, could accurate describe what I&#34;m trying to say about his technique and music style, but he's so amazingly talented, I can't get enough of his haunting voice and his range, and his guitar skills.
0380973464|5|Fantastic read. Just a lot of fun. I digested this thing within a few days, and enjoyed every moment.<br />I also have to say that the technical (hacking.. I know little crypto) aspects of it were surprisingly and  refreshingly accurate... or at least accurate enough that it certainly  didn't distract from my appreciation of it.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|The app is wonderful. I'm glad it was free. The characters and music are like the movie! I would suggest this app to all ages.
1932100660|5|I am a health Care provider and am amazed that the scientific information in this book -is not being addressed by the FDA - well worth reading. VT
B007J4T2G8|4|Good book but not one of the best.
1416526242|5|This autobiography is a must-read, not only because one must have one's eyes wide open to different points of view, backgrounds, life-styles and people, but more so because it will inspire the reader to be a better person and try harder,to be humbled and encouraged at the same time by Ali's courage and integrity. She bravely highlights some issues most of the western world is virtually blind to, a champion of women living under oppression, and a feminist in the true sense of the word. What an inspiring woman, without being inacessible. No wonder she is one of the Time 100.
B000IDGDPA|2|Wasn't quite the feel I was anticipating in the beginning. It's been just a couple of days since I saw it and I can't remember much of it. I'm sure that gives you a sense of how great it was.
B00BSBR9N6|5|LOVELY BOOK!  I loved everything about this book.  i felt as if I was the person working on the ROSIE Project!  I would recommend this to everyone, especially anyone who knows, works with, lives with, or loves someone with a spectrum &#34;situation&#34;.  THANKS Dear Graeme Simsion for this lovely book.
B0089EHWQE|5|Loved the slow build of the relationship.  Loved the emergence of the personalities of will and louisa.  Recommend to all lovers and caregivers.
B00E8JTSVG|5|Beyond Oria Falls is the second book in the Dwellers of Ahwahnee series and once again I have to say - I love this book !!! The story is magical and kept me engaged from the start to the end.  The characters are strong and loveable and when you use your imagination you find yourself relaxing in the evenings with your &#34;friends&#34; beyond Oria Falls.  A must read for everyone from young adult to older adult.  Looking forward to book 3.
B00MB6IYHW|5|Great movie
B00DR0PDNE|4|This chromecast is very cool! however it is limited to what it can be used on right now. we bought it so we could watch missed episodes of shows on TV however it doesn't work well for that, when you watch it off a website through the internet it stalls a lot. however if you watch stuff from you tube or from Netflix it works awesome! i am very happy with this purchase!
B005HS00V4|4|Big early Genesis and Peter Gabriel fan. This concert wasn't my favorite of his with the orchestra backup but I also don't dislike it.
B00AIQP9DE|4|Good storyline, nice graphics. Sucked me in,  and kept my attention during an otherwise long and uneventful  car trip. Would reccomend it.
1250034485|5|Wow!  Out of the four books of the Clifton Chronicles, this has got to be the best one yet and I really liked the other three.<br /><br />The Clifton and Barrington families are the targets of Don Pedro Martinez who blames everyone but himself for his problems.  The book is very quick paced and keeps you engrossed for hours.  Mr. Archer really knows how to write a story and the main characters, book after book, seem like family because you know so much about them.  Awesome writing!  There are some twists in this book that you do not see coming and all at once you are hit with it.<br /><br />I can't wait until the next book comes out, unfortunately not until next year.  Bummer.
B00C5R7B0I|3|The dialog is tiresome and dull.  Such convoluted thought processes this world renowned medical examiner puts us through.  There was little new in the development of the characters.
B000002WYT|5|No matter who you are you are going to love this album. If youve ever had a cd that you had to skip over most of the songs to find a good one, then youll greatly enjoy this cd. Every song is outstanding. Some of my favorites: lie on our graves, so much to say, say goodbye, tripping billies, and of course crash. Go buy it now.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I recommend this fun game for every age!It is fun, adventurous, and exciting. It is sort of addictive, but not much. If you like it THAT much it is. I hope people of every age, and gender like it!
B00BEIYMTW|5|Very happy with my movie postage
B007IXWKUK|5|This was a good read! In the line of trilogy's the second and etc..books are never as good as the first book, but this one I have to say was a good book.
B0064TVQ5E|5|This was a great gift to receive for my birthday, so many sets to choose from. Great fun, beautiful app. Fun play and easy interface.
B000005JA8|1|The first album I ever bought that actually left a bad taste in my mouth!  I'm going to have bad dreams, I think.  The UGLIEST music I've ever heard - like someone clubbing baby seals, but with bad rhythym.  I wish I could get a refund on the time I spent listening to this.
B0072OFM28|5|19.99 for this? why not its awsome, shipped really fast but anyone looking to by this needs to watch the earlier seasons I saw them a year or 2 ago and after watching the first episode I want to watch them over before going on it
B005RUV0NY|3|This is an okay series. I am not big on blood and gore and this series is.  I can't say there is any really great acting going on.  However, there is something a little addictive about the whole show.
B00JAOK4N0|5|SANTANA  IS THE BEST!!!!
B00H2EQFBK|5|'Bloody' good.....a more narrow and focused GoT with some historical relevance.
B009MJU52I|5|The peacock was beautifully designed. I was hoping it would be a bit larger but I would recommend this to friends that wanted to buy it.
B0094BB4TW|1|This app worked fine for months until the latest update. Now the app will no longer install and is totally worthless.
B00J4S4EWO|5|I purchased this for my niece for Christmas and she was over joyed! This was the first and only thing on her list, We all began putting it together right after dinner. The only thing that I could see may be a problem was the shear number of pieces….1500 seems to me to be a lot of potential missing pieces.
B006UKC566|5|The 3d is one of the best that I have seen in a long time, so if your looking for a movie with 3d effects I would highly recommend it.  However, the movie starts out a little boring but it does get better.  All five of us enjoyed this movie.
B00005JKTF|3|Starring Cate Blanchett as a young Scottish woman who joins the French resistance during WW2, this should have been a good film.  But someone made the ridiculous decision to have her speak English the entire time, even though there is a big deal made about how her character speaks fluent French.  Immediately  I was turned off as I've learned to expect at least this basic  degree of authenticity in films.<br />I must say though that the cinematography was wonderful; it brought me right into war-torn France.  I even learned a little bit about what it must have been like to live under the German occupation.  But the lead character's love of a British pilot that brings her to France in the first place, and her relationship with a French resistance fighter, played by Billy Crudup, just didn't sparkle.  And I've seen similar films about Nazi cruelty and Jewish deportation before.<br />Ms. Blanchett is pretty; and her wardrobe seemed authentic for the period.  But her lipstick was just a little too perfect and detracted from any emotion in her face. There was plenty of tension throughout but I was not emotionally moved.
B000HKW7E0|5|God I love this movie.
B000F7CMRM|4|i went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it.  maybe \\"enjoy\\" isn't the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot.  in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks.  but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out.  it succeeds here.  it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence.  Sure, it makes the Gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say \\" it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side\\"..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking.
B00C8S9W0G|4|Great story...as usual.<br />Just going back and forth gets a little complicated..loved the end...waiting for the next one
B004JN1D2I|4|The 4 book set lets you read straight through without having to buy each book individually. I am just about done with them and will definitley be buying the 5th book in the series. Now if Amazon could just get rites to the tv series for Prime, that would be great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Hopeless was a beautifully written story about a heart breaking reality for so many people. I wish everyone in this situation could have such closure. Colleen Hoover's writing is spectacular.
B00005JNBQ|1|I noticed this movie had so much hype. I am in agreement with Ebert's review, although I think this movie was worse than Ebert's rendiditon. I watched the whole movie through, and I have to say, I did not have one single laugh. I thought this movie was not at the very least funny. Unfortunately me and my friends did not share the same type of humour this movie apparently has. <br /> <br />Absolutely aweful.
B000683VI4|5|Hello, just writing to let you know that I am very happy with my purchase, for this is my favorite movie, however I wish you would have described on the details section that the movie is widescreen only and not full screen this really upset me because I prefer movies that are full screen.Just thought I should give you some feedback on that for your future postings. Other than that, the shipping was super fast! Thank You.
B0032Y8XH8|5|i am a huge Mumford & sons fan after buying this album!  i will buy every album that they come out with from here on out!  they have such a unique sound and style and i loved all the shakespearean and Odyssey references in their songs!  a breath of fresh air and a great album to play from begin to end and back again!
B00I8Q77Y0|2|It is as great shot at trying to duplicate flappy bird, but despite the effort, the game isn't ready all that good. Keep trying.
B0069UV0LS|4|Another small, critically acclaimed film that flashed in and out of theaters quickly came to us from the UK, where audiences are more familiar with its first-time director and star. Tyrannosaur follows the story of Joseph, an unemployed alcoholic with crippling anger issues who decides to turn his life around after he accidentally kills his dog. As he develops a relationship with a local charity shop employee, he finds that her husband has violent tendencies of his own, and confrontation appears inevitable. Based on the same kind of environment Considine observed around him growing up in public housing, Tyrannosaur is brutal and unflinching, but I found the performances outstanding and the story of redemption rewarding. those of you looking for a bit of hard-hitting drama should see this.
B004LOMB2Q|4|Is very useful, use it all the time! It helps me stay organized and jot down everything and anything that I wish to keep and remember!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this game to be honest , I think it's better than the original flappy bird it moves way faster. I LOVE THIS APP!!! :D I would recommend it to everyone.
0345803493|4|It's better written than 50 Shades of Grey.<br />The sex acts are about the same rating for me as the first book, but<br />this second book delves more into the non sexual thoughts and feelings and interactions of the characters.
B000001E3V|5|This CD is very difficult to find in stores.  I found in it in just a few clicks on Amazon!  Great service!
B008JGSM6G|4|Christiana good game for parents and kids.  It's challenge.  You only get 3 hints-which I didn't know.  It's great when you are sitting somewhere waiting on your kids.  :)
B0000AQS0F|5|Joss Whedon has now perfected his art. Creating other worlds in which the characters are both loveable and believable is the groundwork in any of his creations, and in this sadly axed from telivison, groundbreaking series, that rule is no exception. <br /> <br />Follow Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew on the ship Serenity as they try to make ends meet in a world that no longer accepts them. Work is scarce in the deep black and often riddled with danger. Friends are equally as scarce and trust is not a thing to be taken lightly! When all you need to do is keep flying, you find out who your allies really are. <br /> <br />With the short lived series now less than a year away from its big screen manifestation \\"Serenity\\" do yourself a favour and get clued up on this Action packed, Funny and Thrilling world.  <br /> <br />All 13 episodes are present here on this excellently presented box set from the originally intended pilot \\"Serenity\\" through to the tense final episode \\"Objects in space\\". Complete with informative behind the scenes documentaries, interviews and even a tour round the set from Joss Himself! Find out what the cast and crew felt when their amazing work got cancelled by the T.V network. Amazing stuff, you wont be able to turn it off!
B008K8VDPU|5|Loved this app! The keyboard self adjusts as the song moves up/down scale. The keyboard prompts are fun to play with, and the many free tones are entertaining. I liked that you can explore a wide variety of music or record your own. The controls are easy to use and the graphics are crisp. I tried several other free keyboard apps, but this one had the most features. Great distraction when you need a little work/study break.
B00FWLSLJ4|4|It was much better than I thought it was going to be.  I think it that was because of the strong acting ability of Charlie Hunnam who plays Jax in Sons of Anarchy.  Special effects are great.  I would recommend seeing this.
B000001085|4|As a fan of Deep Purple in its many incarnations, I find Glenn Hughes to be one of Purple's most interesting voices.  This album allows Glenn to rock and not worry about playing bass.  Backed with two guitars, these  songs really rock.  (Just thing what Purple might have sounded like with  two guitars.)  This is a great live album that needs to be cranked up.
B0042TV4IW|4|This is a feel good movie and I really enjoy this type of movie. I also like British type movies.
B00015YVD6|4|I remember seeing this movie back when I was a kid. I loved the FX, the goofiness of Tom Hanks, and of course Daryl Hannah. After recently rewatching this movie, what I didn't remember was the nudity! I'm guessing my young male brain couldn't handle it at that stage. But I just really can't believe this is PG! Daryl was literally walking around naked for the first 20 minutes of the movie. How did this get a PG rating? Just found it kind of funny and had to post something on it. But it really is a quality movie, so enjoy.
080214473X|4|Bowden's book is written in the kind of language you would expect from a traditional journalist. He is clear, concise, and does not bog his language down in artistic flourish. In fact, in his Afterward he claims to be proud of this straightforwardness with the reader; this despite it garnering him a slight barb from one particular reviewer he mentions.<br /><br />However, it must be said that the structure of the book is a little messy. The number of individuals whose points of view Bowden includes can be daunting to sift through.  I did not even bother to count the POVs he puts down on paper, but the reader should be aware there is no centralized perspective to go back to for reference.  The author does not inject himself into the story (e.g. \\"And then I interviewed this person who said...\\"), and ordinarily that is fine.  But, with a book showcasing the perspectives of so many people -- from lowly soldiers, to the their families, to commanders, to politicians -- it is difficult to sort through who is who and why any particular person is relevant.  What makes it worse is that Bowden doesn't really offer any breaks for a reader to register a transition from one person's POV to another.  Unfortunately, this problem hampers the flow of the story as the reader, at times, may be forced to backtrack just to refresh his or her memory on who is who. To be fair, Bowden interviewed countless individuals and wanted to give a good many of them their due. I have no doubt he left out many of POVs despite deep reservation.  Still, none of this matters if the reader is not discouraged by such things. I was still able to jog through the book at a brisk and enjoyable pace in spite of this road block.<br /><br />Another important note: this book corresponds poorly with the eponymous movie.  The reader will find many of the characters in the movie are composites of actual people Bowden describes in the book.  Not to mention the movie glosses over some of the uglier aspects of war (e.g.in the book, Bowden writes the U.S. Rangers eventually start shooting anything and everything in their path, including a large number of unarmed civilians). So, if you are ready for a dose of reality, read the book and drop your jaw.
B004RUF9DC|5|This single disc Blu-ray movie, arrived on time and intact, with no damage to either the disc or the case that the disc came in. Picture, sound and features playback is superb. I would recommend this Blu-Ray movie, to anyone who purchases it online from amazon.com.
B004S5C8WG|5|great read
B002JVWR4A|5|I love the series and i hate to think that it will be ending.
B000OZ0NXA|3|Read it after watching the movie. Not my usual order and it may have colored my review.  The book was okay. Not the best, but the series is very popular and the movie is awesome. Guess I need to read more. Wasn't bad, but seemed a bit odd that the sheriff's office would offer this level of cooperation. Just strange. I will read more in the series and see if the stories improve. Was odd that this didn't strike the chord that the movie hit.
B002OEBMN4|5|SLAYER has returned with a MONSTER of an album!  Not that they ever went away, but \\"World Painted Blood\\" can take it's unholy place next to \\"Reign in Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\" & \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\". The originators of Extreme Metal have returned to claim their Blood Drenched Throne.  Those people that say they have been in a rut the last few years, just need to listen to this album once--twice--who am I kidding, just leave it in your cd player. Not only have they ditched pro-tools for Dave, but Dave is once again showing why he is the First, the Last & ONLY NAME IN EXTREME THRASH! His drums are thumping & to help with the bone crushing riffs he scaled back to a 9 piece. Tom is back in classic form that was very apparent on \\"South of Heaven\\" & \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", Kerry is well Kerry (we don't our unholy bald brother to change now do we?) Jeff has returned & what a return--SLAYER is 20 times better when Jeff is heavily involved.  This is what the follow up to \\"Seasons\\" should have been. Once again they show the immitators how the big boys do it.   Do yourself a favor & buy this album right now, in fact don't stop with this album, go on a demonic journey until you see yourself throw your horns in the air & scream SLAYER till you lungs bleed.
B000003N8R|5|The title cut's tenor solo is as good as any music gets.  Rest of album is very fine too.
B000059R8Y|5|This is a thoroughly enjoyable CD. From the opening smooth samba of \\"Reptile\\", to the rockin' \\"Superman Inside\\", this CD is full of fresh sounding covers and originals, with excellent playing and production. My favorites are: \\"Reptile\\" (Eric Clapton), \\"Got You On My Mind\\" (Joe Thomas and Howard Biggs), \\"Travelin' Light\\" (JJ Cale), \\"Come Back Baby\\" (Walter Davis), \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" (Stevie Wonder), \\"Second Nature\\" (Eric Clapton), \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" (James Taylor), and \\"Superman Inside\\" (Eric Clapton, Doyle Bramhall II).   It's a good CD to listen to when taking a road trip, or relaxing on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.
B000XUBFE2|5|This story leaves you wanting more and unable to put it down. The characters come alive on the every page.
B0095ZMMCK|5|I have read all of the Tom Clancy Novels, this latest novel is by far one of the best, thus my 5 star rating.
B002RKSZS0|5|This is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen.  In fact, I try to read them all as I like to read them over and over again whenever I can.  Thank you.  It is great to read it on my kindle.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love this type of game. Extra games to play within the game and many challenges.  Very fun to play.
B003B02O14|4|Not much else to say.  I loved the book.  I am a die hard Grisham fan.  Maybe not his best effort, but a great read all the same.
B002M5E2DW|5|Awesome. My first kindle book order. Love Lisa Nichols.
B00I8H6X58|3|Mathew McConaughey's transformation for this role is astounding. Unfortunately, for me, all of the other characters weren't fleshed out well at all. Everyone else seemed to be cliched caricatures put there to meet the minimum number of characters in a movie. His relationship with Jennifer Garner felt contrived. A lot more character development was needed to make this whole movie feel less contrived.
B002UM5BXW|5|For all the folks out there whom think they can open a restaurant, read this book and be warned of what it takes. For all those whom want to know what goes on behind the scenes at a restaurant to produce your delicious plate of food, read this and be warned. For those whom have no clue as what it takes to run a restaurant, read this and be in AWE! Tony Bourdain's literary genius about the underbelly of the restaurant world is a first rate, no nonesense, unadulterated tour de force of REALITY. If you want to keep you rose colored glasses on about how it all happens, well....don't get this book. As an ex chef myself, Bourdain is SPOT ON in his descriptions. READER BEWARE!!! I had so much fun reading it all!!! Well done.
B0055PGUYU|3|Some pretty obvious stuff here.... However, the author writes with a flair that makes it bearable.
B000069AUI|5|Love all coldplay music!
B006LSZECO|3|Very well written had me wanting to go on to the next chapter.  The ending left me hanging and disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is the best game like this. I love the fact that there are 4 different locations to choose from ADDICTING!
B006LSZECO|5|I had trouble setting this book down. The story was very complex, yet believable.  I am going for a followup.
078401213X|5|Pi is a carbon-copy of David Lynch's [[ASIN:B005KYL9LK Eraserhead [Blu-ray]]], and the influence is very evident. What makes Pi so poignant and relevant than ever, is its premonition of economic disaster that predated the global financial crisis by an entire decade. What we have here then, if viewed in this light, is a modern Nostradamus prophecy crafted in a surrealist vein, with numerology thrown in for good measure. Our narrator and central character Maximilian, swallows handfuls of antipsychotic medication in an attempt to stop his hallucinogenic delusions that always culminate in himself trying to stab his disembodied and fly-bespeckled brain. His one and only mentor and confidant dies of a second stroke, and leaves behind a cryptic 216 Kabbalic digit that predicts stock market activity. Max is never given a moments rest between the sexual advances of his Bollywood-hot nextdoor neighbor, being abducted by a cult of Hasidic Jews, and an evil Condoleezza Rice look-a-like that is quick at his heels throughout. The 216-digit is stored in Max's memory [[ASIN:B004R0MF48 Johnny Mnemonic [Blu-Ray]]] style, so the only solution is to shave his head and attempt to extract the information with a handheld power drill. Awesome movie.
B001AQT0RC|4|I like everything about this EXCEPT for Jodie Foster
B001KVZ6F2|5|Another outstanding film with Clint Eastwood at the helm.......Living in the hood (slang) neighborhood and being a veteran of Korean conflict, coming in contact with neighbors from Southeast Asia.....No love lost here.....however, the story develops into something great.....Strongly recommend.....
0790729407|5|I am very happy with the services of amazon. I received my items always on time and in good shape. I have not yet had to return anything. I appreciate the ability to track my orders. I loved the movie. It was a wonderful story.
0385512104|5|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon<br />A wonderfully unique book, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon is one of those rare books that comes around once in a blue-moon and changes your perception of how a novel should be written.  Haddon changes some of the rules and follows the heart of the narrator and main character, young Christopher John Francis Boone, as he tries to solve the mystery of a dog that was found dead in his neighbor's yard.<br />Christopher is a teenager, but not your average every day boy.  He is an autistic savant. He lacks the skills to blend in socially with the rest of the world, has no sense of humor, and can barely find his way around town despite the fact that he can read.  Yet, he is bright and shows a great compulsion for learning, especially in the fields of math and the sciences. In short, he's a genius. He can run quadratic equations in his head, using random variables to find solutions to various problems. He can talk at length about the cosmos, explaining the theory of relativity as if it was child's play.<br />When Chris discovers the next door neighbor's dog \\"murdered\\", he tries his best to search for the truth.  The police and Mrs. Shears accuse him of doing the dirty deed, but as Christopher always explains, he cannot tell a lie and tells the policeman that he did not kill the dog.  After an altercation that ensues due to the policeman touching him, Chris is consequently taken to the local jail, where his worried father comes to pick him up and take him home.<br />Thus begins the rather unusual telling of the story of the murder of a dog, and Christopher's search to discover the killer.  This is Christopher's book, and it is told in his own unique way.  Because of his love of prime numbers, the chapters are numbered with only prime numbers (1,3,5,7,11, and so on).  He intersperses the story with chapters on number games, puzzles, and other interesting facts that float inChristopher's head when he needs to get away from the rest of the world, which more often than not confuses him.  Yet, despite his fear of strangers and his inability to function in society, he ventures out and plays detective, asking neighbors if they had seen anything strange the night before the murder of this dog. <br />I highly recommend THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.  As I had no expectations when I started this book, it was a lovely surprise to find this unusual style of writing in the form of fiction.  At times reading like a math dissertation, other times reading like a journal, it was a different approach to getting to know an unusual character, Christopher Boone.  And while he tells the story of the murdered dog, the reader gets to step inside this unusual mind, to discover what makes him tick, what makes him feel, and what makes him love.  THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME will definitely be on my list of the top 30 books read in 2004.
B00COGZ8FU|3|The acting wasn't great and it was pretty predictable.  The movie was too long but the fight scenes were unique and there were some great camera angles in car chasing scenes.
B004IQMXD4|5|This CD will grow on you with each listen! Next week I would probably rate it 6 STARS if i could. Secret Love and Italian Summer stood out immediately on first listen. Then For What It's Worth and the title track grab your attention. With each listen, you discover something you never noticed before. Ghosts Are Gone really rocks hard. There's really something for everybody on this CD. I just wish it hadn't taken 10 years to wait for new Stevie music!!
B002MQYOFW|5|Would recommend for a mature audience since the book is about killing for sport. Very good read, couldn't put the book down.
B000FIMG68|5|My husband and I are re-watching the Lost series. . . This makes for great date nights at home & I like knowing we can do this all again in a few years.  Go Dharma!

B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved this book very much! It is so well written and you truly feel the emotions of hazel as you read the book. WARNING: do not read at work, you will cry. The story is just beautiful and I felt a strong connections with all the characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone it is great!
B00SQ0E8PE|5|Or should I say my 8 yr old daughter LOVES it.  Actually, I don't mind the songs either.  My favorite is &#34;Kid in Love&#34;, just for the record :)
B00FEMJF6O|1|I enjoy this game a lot, was at level 17 and working on the third series of Christmas challenges, and now it's telling me that I need to update, but the update isn't available on my Kindle. I'm very very frustrated!!!
0375432302|5|I found this book as entertaining as enlightening. I learned a lot about history, the one you don't usually learn, and I truly enjoyed reading it. I wanted to keep going with out finishing it. It is fascinating the way the author talks about Paris' landmarks such as The Louvre. It is absorbing the way Da Vinci is present in this story.<br />I definitely recommend this book. It has become for me a NEW CLASSIC.
B005GG0MIS|5|I learned so much more of the personal lives of our ex presidents..I even grew to like some for the first time.
B00005JJX8|4|<br />Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF (1955, Paramount), which slipped through the cracks in Universal's stupendous 15-film boxed set, has been released on a Paramount Home Video DVD label.  With Oscar-winning color photography by the renowned Robert Burks on location on the French Riviera, the movie is like a relaxing travelogue.  The screenplay is by the great John Michael Hayes, who had just done REAR WINDOW (1954) for Hitchcock.  In a romantic mystery vein, THIEF is the perfect Hitchcock movie for viewers who like romantic mysteries with picturesque settings, but can't deal with graphic violence; THIEF has very little graphic violence. <br /> <br />We have Hitchcock's favorite leading man and leading lady here, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, at their most glamorous.  Cary is falsely accused of being John Robie, a notorious jewel thief.  Jessie Royce Landis, always fun in Hitchcock films, plays Kelly's mother.  Her jewels are stolen, and Grace is positive Grant took them.  So Cary has to stay away from the cops while also (1) romancing Grace in the hills above Monaco, and (2) finding the real cat burglar to clear his own name.  That's the whole plot.  The movie is very relazing and leisurely paced for 106 minutes.  Watch the outrageous picnic lunch scene, where Grace pulls out a chicken and asks Cary if he'd like a leg or a breast!  And the incredible love scene in a darkened room with kisses on a couch while spectacular fireworks go off outside the window like an epic orgasm. <br /> <br />Edith Head was costume designer here and must have had a field day working on the climactic masked ball, where Cary scampers across a night rooftop while the party goes on below.  He unmasks the real villain, while trying not to get shot by cops who are still positive (and in error) that Cary is the actual thief.  The DVD of TO CATCH A THIEF is a brand-new one in VistaVision and with several informative documentary bonuses.  Not a Hitchcock masterpiece, this is delightful, suspenseful, and scenic romantic mystery escapism that is still better than most lesser filmmakers' best work.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre and this greatest of all directors. <br /> <br />
0385737947|2|This book would have been great IF:<br /><br />1) the characters had some personality<br /><br />2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently \\"remembering\\" important information to advance the plot<br /><br />3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - \\"shuck-face,\\" really, is this supposed to be cool?<br /><br />4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous<br /><br />5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving walls and un-threatening prickly Grievers<br /><br />6) the plot weren't based on constant withholding of information by everyone and releasing it 200 pages later than it should have been<br /><br />7) the smartest of the smartest kids actually did something smart and uncovered some mysteries of the maze during the 2 years spent there<br /><br />8) the death of main characters evoked any feeling in readers<br /><br />9) the book weren't so slow-moving (thanks to constant withholding of info) and BORING!<br /><br />In the present form \\"The Maze Runner\\" deserves nothing more than an OK rating for moderately interesting premise. The hype and comparisons to \\"The Hunger Games\\" are unwarranted.
B008YKGQR4|2|I was seriously disappointed after I got it. It worked alright, I guess, it was the same as the browser version, but then, stuff became all distorted and colors reversed and it all just glitches up. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR KINDLE FIRE HD
B0064X7FVE|5|Great
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|It is just like the PC version of it(non 1.2) I love it :)) so much nostalgia I love it
B00BI73CVI|4|I really enjoyed Les Miserables and the acting was excellent.  I watched it twice and my roommate and I both enjoyed it.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were fantastic, though Anne Hathaway's part was a very small part of the movie as a hole. It was raw, but we knew that the director made them sing live before turning it on and I was in no way disappointed in the result. Despite some fairly intense criticism, Russell Crowe did a pretty good job as Javert considering his usual singing is with his mate's in their band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, which is the only other time I've heard him sing and it is pretty much a local Australian bar band.  He's an actor, not a singer really, but it's not like it hurt to listen to him.  Just sometimes he looked like he was trying so hard.
0062086529|2|The book arrived with a large black smear across the two pages where the boy is climbing the mountain. This is disappointing since the book is a gift for my nephew and is otherwise a great book.
B0063GORYU|5|I really love this game....I can spend hours playing and never notice how much time has passed.  It is very addicting and requires plenty of pre-planning for your moves!
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Good book
B005HF0BIE|5|Excellent
B00L9B7IKE|4|Enjoyed the book.....kept me on the edge of my seat!
B00N45UAZS|3|I understand why this movie didn't do better in the theaters but I liked it. I found it interesting and action packed.  Was the story line convoluted? You bet but what action movies aren't these days.  All in all it was fun even if a bit unbelievable in spots.
B00957T6X6|5|If you haven't read these books, I'm sorry for how much you've missed! The TV show is good, I love it, but the books? They take you to another dimension. Kind of like some 'how it was made and background and full character' knowledge.<br />If you read them closely, you'll see what really happens with the Starks. But you must read it closely.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I have loved the other books but I felt like this one was just like my life and I think there should have been a bit better ending. I'm trying not to cry now because my life is like katniss. I say if your life is not like katniss you won't understand as good but if you do you know what I mean. Trying not to cry when you know that everything that happens in this book could really happen to anyone it makes you realize that we need to know who we trust and who we love. Spoiler alert... I was so upset when prim had died after all that katniss went through for her. Another spoiler alert... when  katniss killed coin instead of snow I admit that surprised me till I figured out what she was saying and I agree with her. I will not tell you what it meant by what happened you will have to figure out what happens.
B00005QDW1|4|This album has more of a dance feel then Tragic Kingdom (the only other ND album I have) but this album is good.<br />1.Intro-It's a 27 second intro, starts the same way as Rock Steady (13th track) and I think this should've been an interlude for rock steady. 10/10<br />2.Hella Good-Probably my favorite song.  This is getting played on certain stations a lot, but this is still a good song. 9/10<br />3.Hey Baby featuring Bounty Killer-This is the 1st single and it's a REALLY good song.10/10<br />4.Making Out-The chorus gets old fast, but the verses are nice. 8/10<br />5.Underneath It All- 2nd single, and it's an ok song.  7/10<br />6.Detective-Awesome song! 10/10<br />7.Don't Let Me Down-This song just gets really dull. 6/10<br />8.Start The Fire-This song is so BORING!  2/10<br />9.Running-Sweet. 8/10<br />10.In My Head-Better then 'Running'. 10/10<br />11.Platinum Blonde Life-This song is awesome, even though I'm not blonde! 10/10<br />12.Waiting Room-Boring. 4/10<br />13.Rock Steady-GREAT song. 9/10<br />113/130=4 stars

034580709X|2|I saw the film Headhunters, which I loved. I then discovered it was written by Jo Nesbo.  My brother had 5 of his books, so passing through the airport I picked up the first in the series.<br />Grisham and Connely take us more into the detective and legal process, where I feel as though I am learning something.<br />I just did not get anything from the book.<br />I found myself speed reading and skipping paragraphs which were irrelevant.<br />Tried it. Done it.  Not my cup of tea.
B00DR0PDNE|4|We have parties at home often and its great to be able to sit in the kitchen and change songs or movies being played on my home theater.  The only downfall for me is that this product does not allow you to play movies that you own or stored directly on your computer or phone.  Overall this is a great product!
B00A80SHFM|5|The music and sound recording are lovely.  Having seen the film, I appreciate having hte film soundtrack rather than the stage soundtrack.  I realize stage tracks generally have better sound quality but this is fine for me.
B000001ZS4|5|I consider this album to be the best album ever. Yes, I'm a JMJ fan, so of course I say it is the best, but no matter what, it is the best.<br />The first rewiew of this album was written by Felix Matahias. He claims that JMJ was not the person who invented the electronic music. Felix claims that Claus Schulze already had done an electronic album 1976. Yes, and JMJ did his Oxygene 1976 and it was the FIRST album with ONLY electronic musci. Maybe Claus Schulze had drums or anything else non-electronic instrument incorparated in his album? To mention that Oxygene JMJ did as the first electronic album, he had done three other albums before that, &quot;La Cage&quot;, &quot;Les Granges Brulees&quot; and &quot;Deserted Palace&quot; wich is only electronic music, and Deserted Palace was created by him in the beginnig of the 70's. So JMJ did not create the electronic instruments, but he created the electronic music.
B000065VA1|5|Peter Gabriel's SO is really one of the best albums in my collection.  It's the best album by Peter Gabriel.  If you really loved and enjoyed SO then I suggest you NOT buy his new album \\"Up\\".  That was one of the worst (and most disappointing) purchases of my life (I purchased it the day it came out, right after classes).  When I got home and played it I was so disappointed that I gave it away at a flea market.
B00003CXDZ|5|I just got back from seeing this movie at the theatre and I can't put into words how good it is.  If you don't like musicals, you shouldn't go see this--it is very much a modern day musical.  Nicole Kidman proves to be a magician of many tricks once again.  Her talent is heightened to a new level.  Ewan McGregor shines very brightly, even in the light of Ms. Kidman.  He is gorgeous and talented, all in one.  They both have extremely pleasant voices to listen to.  All in all, everything was awesome, to say the least.  Be ready for continual business on the screen-- your eyes really don't get a break throughout the movie.  The plot moved along nicely, not lacking for anything, not dragging.  I didn't once look at my watch, like I do in many recent movies.  As soon as this comes out to pre-order, I'll be ordering it!  It is a MUST HAVE in every music-buff's collection!

B008TRUDAS|5|This book was ... just so much more then I could have thought . It was emotional, in all aspects. There were sad parts that made you cry or want to. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. There were parts that made me so mad I could yell. But most of all there were parts that made you rethink the way you live your life and the choices you make, or don't make. I love this book so much !
B0085G0DNU|5|**Updated** I want to bring to everyone's attention that in order to get all the bonus tracks you must buy the soundtrack TWICE: once here and once on itunes.  I bought the itunes version to get two extra tracks and I highly recommend them both.  I almost lowered my score to 4 stars given you are not purchasing the complete soundtrack on Amazon or itunes.  There is even a track that you can ONLY get by purchasing your movie tickets at movietickets.com which I have not done.  This trend, which began with DLC for video games, is not befitting the consumer and I am a bit annoyed.  That being said, I added my thoughts on four of the five bonus tracks below.<br /><br />Quite by accident, I noticed that the entire soundtrack was available for streaming on Empire Online legally, a week before it comes out officially.  I have been looping the soundtrack since and it is epic.  Hans Zimmer is by far my favorite composer alive trumping even John Williams in my mind.  Zimmer is responsible for my favorite themes and soundtracks scoring everything from the Lion King to Call of Duty.  His work with James Newton Howard on the first two movies was sensational, but this is the first time going it alone in a Batman movie.<br /><br />Zimmer admitted that he had no problem working on the \\"Batman\\" half of the scores, but relied on Newton Howard for the \\"Bruce Wayne\\" aspect.  This dynamic is reflected in this soundtrack as the love themes are notably absent.  This is clearly a dark movie.  In its place are the haunting chants and melancholy strings which provide volume to the entire score.<br /><br />Many of the recognizable themes from the original two movies make a reappearance in this score but not in an bad way.  The old is mixed with the new and Zimmer often reinterprets his old themes to give them new life.<br /><br />\\"The Storm is Coming\\" is clearly an introduction.  It is a short track that is about half a minute and probably is played with the corporate logo as the film begins.<br /><br />\\"On Thin Ice\\" seems to convey an emotion of looking back at the previous films and the devastation Gotham has endured.  It is filled with sad strings and a hint of the looming terror.  We are introduced to the final theme played throughout the soundtrack.  It is quiet but reminds me of \\"528491\\" from inception which preceded the great \\"Mombasa\\" action track.<br /><br />\\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" is clearly the first set piece of the movie.  I remember hearing it when I saw the first six minutes of the film in IMAX in December.  I am not going to spoil what happens, but suffice it to say it is the first time we meet Bane and he makes quite an entrance.  The track uses entirely new music.  On my first play-through it was unremarkable, but put it on a good car audio system and the layers pop out.  The bass on this track is taken from Zimmer's inception playbook.  The tone is foreboding and terrifying but beautiful.  It is almost all electronics and drums while introducing us to Bane's theme (the chants).<br /><br />\\"Mind if I cut in\\" is my least favorite track.  I agree with the other reviewer that this is an example of where Newton Howard would have filled this void.  This is a slow track with piano and violin.  It reminds me of a detective track where a character is looking t uncover some mystery.  My guess is this is when we are introduced to Selena Kyle.<br /><br />\\"Underground Army\\" is another quiet track with lots of electronics.  It has a menacing tone as if evil plans that are being made by Bane and his henchman.  It introduces a few new melodies but seems like an average track at best.<br /><br />\\"Born in Darkness\\" looks back at Batman's past by echoing themes from the \\"Batman Begins\\" but appears as another quiet filler track.<br /><br />\\"The Fire Rises\\" is the second major action music which introduces some new themes and horror elements with minor notes, strings and drums.  The track seems to depict (and this is just a guess) Batman's first encounter with Bane.  There are lulls in the action which build to intense loud action queues.  This track must be listened to on a great audio system to reveal its layers.  I find this track to get better with repeated listenings.  Zimmer certainly uses his inception style in this track with the heavy electronics towards the end.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Out There\\" sounds like its straight out of the \\"Dark Knight.\\" It quietly repeats the piano (love?) theme from the previous movies but never utilizes the full orchestra.  It is another filler track.<br /><br />\\"Despair\\" is filled with new and old music blended together. He reinterprets his \\"Dark Knight\\" music from \\"Why So Serious\\" by throwing in a long cello build-up with the famous two note themes.  The second half of the track is a reinterpretation of the end of \\"I'm not a Hero\\" from the previous soundtrack as well.  While it repeats alot from past soundtracks it remains fresh and exciting.<br /><br />\\"Fear will Find You\\" seems to be another action sequence against Bane.  Zimmer uses the chants for the first time alongside intense drums and electronics mixed with the old themes and the new theme from this movie.  The two are seamlessly integrated.  You will think you know the track straight out of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and then it will take a new and unique turn.  It could be construed as a remix, but I think of it as a fresh take.<br /><br />\\"Why do We Fall\\" is one of Zimmer's finest as it builds to a swelling climax with strings and drums.  Batman is clearly defeated in spirit but is convinced to try one last time. (This is another guess).  It builds to epic levels before breaking out in the Batman drum and string theme.<br /><br />\\"Death By Exile\\" is a filler track that offers little to nothing but an additional track listing.  At 23 seconds it should have been combined with the next track.<br /><br />\\"Imagine the Fire\\" is the most epic track and contains many new action queues coupled with old familar themes.  It reminded me of \\"Mombasa\\" from his Inception score and \\"The Chase\\" from Batman Begins.  This track has everything from old themes to electronics to strings and drums.  This track completes the soundtrack and demonstrates Zimmer's abilities to orchestrate a climactic final encounter with Bane (another guess?).<br /><br />\\"Necessary Evil\\" clearly depicts the aftermath of the final battle.  I feel as though there are hints as to the outcome but no certainties.  It is a suspenseful track as the movie has not yet been released.  It quietly references the Batman theme introduced in this movie.<br /><br />\\"Rise\\"  This is Zimmer's playground to end the film on an epic note.  It is very much like \\"A Dark Knight\\" from the last soundtrack but is a slower (and more epic) version of the final track soundtrack which sends chills down your spine. The swelling strings and slow pace allow the orchestra to really shine.  This track again hints at the outcome of the movie without being definitive.  Clearly it depicts loss, but on what scale?  I love this track, but it is not long enough.  It is the final Batman track we will hear from Zimmer, so I wished it would be more like the 17 minutes of the last finale.<br /><br />**Update**<br />\\"No Stone Unturned\\" is a bonus track that I just downloaded.  Essentially, there is nothing specifically new here but it remixes the themes from all the movies as an action piece.  It is absolutely a must have for any fan of the soundtrack.  Its an exciting track that adds to the intensity of the overall score.  At 7 minutes, it is an impressive piece.<br /><br />\\"Risen from the Darkness\\" is another bonus track which is similar in principle to the first one.  It again remixes old themes with the new and adds one more action track to this terrific soundtrack.  Again it's nothing groundbreaking or new, but gets the action music swelling in new ways.<br /><br />\\"Bombers of Ibiza\\" is the final bonus track and is clearly has the touch of a different composer.  It's all synthesizers here and clearly what you think of with normal remixes.  This track I could do without.  It almost feels like club dance music.  It's not bad but also not memorable.  There is even a little dubstep mixed into the track.<br /><br />With the new tracks, the first two listed are clearly the work of Zimmer working in the studio to put together old familiar themes to make them into exciting yet generic action tracks.  These first two do feel like they could be played somewhere in the movie and could have been added to the original soundtrack.  The final track is a standard third party remix which has some nice rhythm but comes across as dance music.<br /><br />**NEW UPDATE** These are my thoughts on the itunes bonus tracks.<br /><br />\\"The Shadows Betray You\\" is a track you get from the itunes version and I feel disappointed it was not included in the original soundtrack.  It is a very dark track with synthesizers featuring the new themes.  It almost sounds muffled, (perhaps a reference to Bane's mask)but in an intentional awesome way.  I recommend finding this track.<br /><br />\\"The End\\" is another itunes track clearly the credits and all I have to say is WOW!  I feel upset that this track was not included in the soundtrack as well.  I love this track.  It is slow and brooding and is very unlike the other tracks.  It is ominous and intense and features the familiar themes but with a Darth Vaderesqe breathing in the background.  This is a very dark ending.  I hope they release a more complete soundtrack or where you can pick these songs up individually.<br /><br />**End of Update**<br /><br />Obviously the movie has yet to be released and will likely enhance the listening experience of the entire soundtrack, but it doesn't need a movie to be considered a spectacular accomplishment.  Unfortunately I don't have the musical training to properly convey my emotions regarding this soundtrack, but hopefully the tone of the review demonstrates my enjoyment of this score.<br /><br />Everyone expects the best from a Hans Zimmer score as they do with Chris Nolan and Zimmer does not disappoint.  I will be looping this soundtrack for weeks to come no doubt.  Words fail to describe how much I love all of Hans Zimmer's work and must be experienced rather than listened to.  Together the three Nolan-Batman soundtracks rank up there with Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars as the best trilogy scores of all time.  Listen to this soundtrack often and on a great audio system with strong bass.  Your ears will thank you for it and your neighbors will forgive you (I hope) for the vibrations.<br /><br />**NOTE**<br />I also saw that there are additional tracks that come with the physical CD, so I preordered it as opposed to the MP3 option.  Ill add my thoughts once the CD comes.
B00QL0ST1K|5|It's great, you can play with very good players & it's fun!
B001UTW7QU|5|ZFT
B00CL66FEQ|3|Decent story.  Predictable.  Some funny parts.  Didn't hold my interest well.
B00FKF0F3C|2|It was nearly 18 months ago when I started this trilogy.  The first two parts were an excellent example of historic fiction.  With a great blend of characters and history, I have waited with anticipation for this third part.<br /><br />The follow-up on the lives of the families was very well planned and easily picked up again with the help of flash back reminders.  The disappointment for me is we get to much of Mr. Follett's political bias in this final book.  Now if you want to hear about how great Kennedy was and how personable Johnson was ... then read it.  But, most of the book is centered around bashing conservative leaders.  Don't look for one word on poor liberal leadership, in fact the book misses out on four very important events in my generation: Ford's presidency, Carter's disaster, the space program and Woodstock .... with all the musical sections in this book, how do you leave out Woodstock?<br /><br />A disappointing conclusion to a great first two books.
B00HAQAQME|5|It was a great movie, with some wonderful performances by cast. Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale were so great.<br /> Cate Blanchett performance<br /> was definitely academy award
0060899220|5|very funny
0316743003|5|One day soon, people will begin to claim that putting a man on the moon, safely operating an aircraft like the SR-71 for many years, or, flying daily New York to London supersonic never really happened - centimental people from the 60's just like to think their generation did those things. Without books like this the conspiracy theory would be attractive. Accountants are trained to know the cost of everything. Engineers, on the other hand, are trained to see the value in people and their ideas irrespective of their status. In the 1950s and 60s accountants just did the accounts. But it was a golden age for engineers. <br /> <br />Ben Rich reflects towards the end of this book that if they wanted to re-create the SR-71 today - it may not be possible - not for engineering reasons but accountants now have so much power over their technical colleagues - the programme would be too constrained.  <br /> <br />There is much talk about hydrogen powered cars these days. This book has excellent reporting on the practicalities of handling and storing large amounts of hydrogen from a study done in the 1950s by Mr Rich. His experience suggests there are big problems associated with the hydrogen fuel cell car.
0767817710|3|ok movie - a bit off beat. Hackman plays a great &#34;bad man.&#34;  Where does Sharon Stone get the skills in her life to go from a terrified child to a &#34;gun fighter?&#34;  Background on her character would have been good.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Love the series! I am really looking forward to the next book.
B009CPJHY4|5|Delightful!!
6304602898|5|The gremlins were first and I think they ought to do one these days where the gremlins get out and get the furbies but as for this film it is the one of the greatest movies to come from eighties.  It's a kid's film but scary enough that adults will like it but yes you should be on hand for grabbing if a child wants to watch but maybe you should watch first and see if it's suitable for your child age.  Some children are more sensitive than others are.  My daughter seems to scare easily but she loved the gremlins.  I loved it as a kid.  It's great rooting for Gizmo and hoping he ends up all right.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as my family.  I try to share the classics of my youth with my children.
B00D2K40WY|5|It is so fun when I have nothing to do I go to this game it is so interesting&amp;fun and I think the game is so much fun and other people would like it so much. And if the rates had more stars I would give it 780 stars.<br /><br />  Love,faith speer
B00756GRUE|5|Excellent watch, real head turner.
B00IS87HYI|5|These games were downloads for my grand daughter who is 12, she loves them.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Finally a liberating history of the Vikings based on THEIR SAGAS. Each script hand written filled with their humanity and their contributions to the worlds evolution. They were the first Democratic society that gave truly equal rights to their women who shared tremendous burden of everyday surivival.
B0065NAKRO|2|Tiles are VERY small and movement of tiles is odd - you slide it up from your stock but then it moves down from the top.<br /><br />Available tiles are lighted taking all chance of missing a play and drawing another tile by mistake - it almost plays itself.<br /><br />Would have returned for a refund if I could.
B005544TRQ|3|Meh.
B000066NW0|1|All I have to say is that Avril sucks. She'a a terrible singer and this cd is crap. Her only good songs are: Sk8ter Boi and I'm with you. The rest are crap. She's the worst singer in the music business and she should also take speech therapies. I don't recommend this album to anyone.
B00M7UTFW0|3|Not Biblical
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This is a very cool game
B00APYKXFS|1|The first two or three reviews talk about all that is wrong with the game: your ship and the enemy ships are the same color, etc. I played with the volume off, but I'll take the other person's word for it that that sucks also, just based on how bad the game does. Granted, I wouldn't have downloaded this if it weren't the game of the day, so naturally I'm not out any money, but the GOTD should be GOOD. Does anyone at Amazon even review the apps before declaring them the App of the Day? This one apparently slipped under the radar. Don't waste your time.
B00DGMVJAO|5|I enjoyed the movie and I will watch it again very soon.  Interesting the way they took the child story and made it work.
B0089LT8Y6|3|I really enjoy Formation of Damnation the overall feel is smoother than Dark Roots. Dark Roots does have some high points but the previous release is a lot heavier in my opinion. The DVD is ok, the live stuff remains me of a home made recording though. The remakes though, are really true remakes.
B000G0O5N2|5|This movie is simply excellent. The story it tells, while shaded from the true story told in the book of the same title, is still essentially true and gives us reason to be humbled and honored that men like these exist and are willing to do these things for us.<br /><br />I already had the DVD version and bought the Blu Ray because I read a review that said it is even better. It is better, but not a lot. If you don't have the DVD version, get the Blu Ray. If you have the DVD, you don't need the Blu Ray.
B004IAFBAM|5|Brings back good memories from childhood
B00EUS9JF0|5|There are quite a few reviews out here, so I'll make this short. First off, I am a huge Beatles fan. That also includes being a fan of their solo work but Paul was always my favorite. With that being said, I think this album will not disappoint his fans. I've been listening to this cd all day and I can say that I am really enjoying this one. Out of all of the songs, my least favorite song is the single \\"New\\". I have a few favorites, but it sounds fresh but at the same time, it sounds very Paul from times past. I am also glad I purchased the two bonus songs as well and I absolutely love the hidden track - Scared.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wanted this on vinyl, but didn't want to wait until November to hear this, so I purchased the mp3 deluxe edition from Amazon and had no issues with the transaction.
B000FC2L1E|5|This one is just as great as the first two. Love her style.
B00EMKVKCQ|5|Great
B006LSZECO|5|I think I'm the last person to read this book! I loved it. I wanted to see the movie but I like to read the book first. Looking forward to the movie. The only thing I dislike about reading the book after the movie is out is that the characters become the actors.
B000B8QEZG|5|Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor is #1 in record sales since its release in the US.  Both the album and single is #1 in the UK. She is #1 in the dance/exended play genre and in #14 pop single according to Billboard.  Need I say more?
B000062XFG|3|Great stuff, but technical issues with the DVDs themselves, picture drift, digital lines at the top of the screen, led me to try the DVDs on several other players.  All yielded the same results.  Replacement copies had the same issues.
B002NNA9N0|3|An interesting movie, great cinematography, amazing acting from some very big names, but the dialogue's strength hinged on stringing together expletives then shooting them at each character for an effect that left the movie overdone and heavy handed. Almost a great movie, but missed the mark.
B00I8H6MGS|5|One of McConaughey's best performances!  The movie really captures how things were in the Aids community back in the Eighties.
B00JB3MVCW|4|Interesting take on the story of Noah and mankind.
B009HUB40Y|4|I enjoyed playing.
B00ANAC32U|4|What can I say, it's been on my phone for a while now, no problems, but then again I haven't tried to drop test it or anything.  It fits well, and all the buttons work as expected.
B00QR7ZM8A|1|Dylan is no crooner. Should stick to his skill set
B000FBFMIO|5|Robin Hobb is an excellent writer. She has created an exciting world with real characters. One of my favorite series.
B00HBQWGXK|4|A typical Reacher with a bit more international flavor.  His series is a fun read and like his other titles, this book is hard to put down.  There is an absence of romance and one wonders whether Reacher is getting beyond that.  Despite aging a bit, he is still able to hold more than his own in the area of physical violence.  There is also a bit more of a twist in this story than in his other titles.  All in all, a fun read and it shall be difficult to face a time when Reacher does not come to the rescue.
B00EGMQIJ0|3|I gave this book the rating I did because author is capable of so much more. I probably disliked the girl I was pulling for more and more as the book progressed. The premise has been done before in other formats.  However at present this book isn't so futuristic as the classics.  Technology is practically there. Privacy doesn't exist and I assume I'm being watched and listened to. Purchases are tracked, and I could go on and on. So book wasn't prescient, but clever. For me, the book kind of went too far in the end. I think another ending would have made the book stronger
B00HOGGUZW|1|I'm still trying this out but for now I find that either the application is not sensitive enough to my touch or I can't find the right location to move through the different steps to proceed through the game.
B00BFUUMO8|1|ARGGGGGGG!!!! Are you kidding me?!?! Just as I try to delete it, it gets stuck in my applications list andni cant even get it out! When I go back to the appstore it just gives me the option to open the app. it cant uninstall or install!?!? WHAT THE F*** LUDIA INF.?!?!
B0088P2A7A|5|Great for research and super easy to use.  I now use it more than the basic search engines.  One of my favorite apps!
B007EC27QM|4|it fuctions like a real calculator
B000002MFE|4|It's a good album from beginning to end.  But if you like Clapton's older stuff (Cream, Derek & the Dominoes) then you may be a little disappointed by the fact it's unplugged.
B0018OFN2W|5|I love this series. It keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next. I was so surprised when I saw the price. Amazon was the cheapest.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I can't seem to get enough of the series and this Season has been as good as the first 2. I find myself as being that fly on the wall excited to enter others lives without participating just observing.
B00004RFCM|1|Take note:  HBO Video is releasing Sex and the City: The Complete Series on November 1st. The mammoth twenty-disc box set will include all ninety-four episodes from the six seasons that the show aired. As for bonus materials, all the extras from the previous season sets will be included. An additional disc of new bonus features has been created for this release and will contain a trivia game, guest appearance highlights, as well as various guides to fashion, restaurants and dating advice. The \\"super-premium\\" set will be packaged as a decorative velvety photo album coffee table book. Retail will be hernia-inducing $299.95
B00BGIC2J2|2|This is a depressing movie. I get that the concept should be about how depressing midlife can be, but this story line was just painful. Sure, there were some funny parts, but we generally were waiting (and waiting) for the movie to turn around and to see a silver lining through all of the angst. Alas, we were disappointed at the end. I agree with the other folks -- this really doesn't have anything to do with Knocked Up.
B00006JDS4|2|I was intrigued by the synopsis of &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;, because I love movies about women getting revenge, like &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and &quot;Sleepaway Camp 2&quot;. I had been contemplating on weather renting this or not, beucase it's soppousedly soppoused to be so shocking and graphic, that you can't bare to watch it. Well, I was able to watch the whole thing with my eyes open. And it's only sort of shocking. The death scenes are no gorier or violent than those in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies. Now, even tho I love films with women getting revenge, I did not love this. I only sort of liked it. The problem is is that it just didn't have enough to it. It felt like there was something missing. And it's shown in such a monotonous slide-show way. Like, okay, lets see her get raped. Now she cleans herself. Now she kills this guy. Now this guy. Now this guy. Now this guy. It makes the film feel so much shorter, and uncomplete. Now, Camille Keaton; I real liked her acting in this movie. She says everything in a really cool way, but at the same time somehow makes everything she says funny, mostly when she's talking to the guys before she kills them. Overall, I don't reccomend this unless you have to see every horror film on the shelves.
B00WSD2BGS|5|Great!
B00GB5ND9S|4|A fun little diversion. Primarily a kid's game, but I like to use it to unwind at the end of the day. I could actually see some little ones getting frustrated at the complexity of some of the tasks; the solution is not always intuitive. Got this as a FAOTD but would not have regretted paying for it.
B00KQFP5GS|5|Much better than the original!
B008IJTFYW|5|I got this app cause it was free...then played it for my six month old when he was fussy...and went to sleep minutes!!! he was awoken later and the app put him back to sleep....I love it! It was even soothing to hear while the baby was listening.
B0051ANPZQ|5|This book is amazing. I cried laughed, And I am so passionate about this book. I have read over 700 books, and this was the best.
B006VRDZ44|4|Excellent season 1, please add season 2 to amazon prime!!!!
B0002Z0EYA|4|I am a mythology fan, and I was really looking forward to this movie.  I became immediately alarmed at the slow beginning, and while I was entertained for the majority of the movie, something wasn't quite right and I didn't know what it was until the end.  WHERE was the MEAT of the STORY?  Sure, it was \\"explained\\" nicely, but I felt incredibly ripped off from the minimal portrayal of Helen of Troy and the CRITICAL role she played.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are no gods in this film... they are mentioned and briefly shown in statues, but there are no live characters-- dissapointing. <br /> <br />That aside, there was some *excellent* battle scenes that I've been hungry for in a non-LOTR setting for a change.  Also, there was some really good acting from the supporting roles which really carried this film through.   <br /> <br />I normally would avoid comparing this to similiar films of this vein, however, the background music is so similar to that of Gladiator (which can take the Pepsi Challenge with this movie any ol' day of the week) I found myself reflecting back on Gladiator and feeling that Troy was a lesser film.  Much to my delight, some of the actors from Braveheart play important lead roles in Troy, so again, I felt myself yearning for strength in story that Braveheart had. <br /> <br />
B00910Y1OQ|5|This game has great graphics and is one of the most challenging match 3 games I've played.  It starts off fairly easy but then quickly becomes more difficult with a lot of strategy involved. Highly recommend!
B009PNQUXO|3|It often says file to big or it can't download this platform, but most of the time it works properly.  It's hit and miss to be honest, but it's a nice app to have.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I thought this book was well written and an enjoyable summer read! Better than gone girl for the most part.
B000KITQK2|5|Fantastic! Better than I expected!
B000AMJC2K|5|Well made and fully adjustable.
068483605X|5|This is the only book I read for three years.  I enjoyed it so much, I had to read it over and over again.  I was only 13 then and have since lost my copy.  But, now at age 27, I will buy another copy, and read it once more.  Yes, I have PLENTY of other books on my bookshelves, and I have read countless others.  But this is the ONLY one I will read again and again, and enjoy more and more
B000NQRE1E|5|I have this on vhs and wanted it on dvd.  It arrived in record time.  I've watched it several times since I received it and plan on watching it a lot more.
B00000FCBC|4|When i first heard the album I was  blown away by the cover Turn The Page. Kirk's immitation of the sax is awesome.  The riffs on this album are superb...not many bands could cover this music and/or write solos etc that fit the way metallica did. Some songs are very fast and satanic others are mellow yet heavy. I have been playing guitar for 7 yrs and still cant play half of whats on the album. The made the songs more appealing to this generation. Its worth listening to ...
B0010SKUYM|3|It always comes down to taste,but it moved a little slow to me. Some books you can't put down and find yourself reading in the wee hours of the morning.This one took some effort to finish to me.
B008673ZAQ|4|I liked the story. I don't think it is so much like 50 Shades and it is not a good read. I hate the cliff hanger endings though.
B0012GTZC0|5|Ken Follett at his best! Excellent plot and of course his style of mixing History with Fiction. Positively riveting !
B00722ZHG6|5|As expected, fast shipping
B00FAPF5U0|3|You can't beat the price. I still have not really learned to play it. My wife and daughter play it all the time. I'm sure it will be better when I have time to play it. If i play games it is usually solitare. I'm sure young people would enjoy playing this game,
B007QA3AH2|5|Great fun and laughs, especially if you are familiar with Star Trek. Good to just unwind from a busy schedule.
B007I1TFK0|3|ok bot tok a long time to git her
B00004XPPE|5|Love this drama
B009ZQC7MY|4|I love, love, love the Downton Abbey series, however, I do wish they would stop killing off all the good characters.  Very disappointed with the way Season 3 ended!
B004U52VPS|5|Fue buena la compra, satisfizo mis expectaciones,<br />Creo que llego de buena manera el producto a mis manos.<br />Nada mas que se ve&iacute;a mas grande en las fotos
B009ZQC7MY|5|Thoroughly entertaining and captivating!  A sure hit for those long winter days and nights....not sure what we'll do w/o them come March!!
B004SD5GZ4|5|Really good pdf reader
B003O86FMW|4|This book as well as the other two in the series was very creative, cruel sometimes but kept you on the edge of your seat.
B003YL4LYI|5|Amazing book. Be careful though George R.R. Martin will kill everyone you love! George R.R. Martin does not use twitter because he killed all 140 characters!
B009UZBLSG|1|Do not buy because it does not work on Nexux 7
0553381407|2|Having come from a dysfunctional family with a controlling mother and escapist father (I will spare the details)this book really hit home for me.  Like many people, I didn't even realize our family had serious problems until I was in my late twenties.  It has been and still is very painful. I confronted my parents by letter many years ago and got just the disappointing results this book warns of.  I was considering doing it again and hoped this book would have helpful advice, but it proposed exactly what I had already tried.  She says not to expect your parents to change, but that the process of confrontation will be liberating.  Then goes through the pros and cons of confrontation and admits that it may not be worthwhile to actually confront your parents and that role playing with others may be more helpful. Okay...  My thinking is that people that don't know they have problems aren't likely to be reading this.  People that know, shouldn't expect to find their answers here...
B007PTJOV0|5|my best friend got this on her ipod touch and let me try it. it was so much fun. when I saw that leps world was on the kindle fire I was thrilled. every spare moment I have I spend it playing leps world.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Slow start but over all it was a good read. Didn't like the whiney spells but great twist in the end never thought was coming.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Super fun time wasters !
B00HTYTQ5A|5|One of the best shows I have ever seen! Though it wasn't quite as fantastic as the earlier series, Series 3 doesn't disappoint!
B00MRHANNI|5|Great gift.
B00GP0G0IK|5|Really enjoying this puzzle and hog game! I hope it goes a ways more before locking me out to buy more. But I'll be hooked by then... that's the plan!
B006ZWLXZ8|5|I loved this album so much I'm actually writing a review for it. Great music, it's dark yet beautiful. I enjoyed every second of this album .
B00FAPF5U0|4|it was fun and enjoyed playing it alot. my 4yr old loves playing as well, it keeps him claim for hours.
B00006CXXU|4|Ok I would never admit this to anyone that knows me but for as long as she's been out I've disliked her. She's one of those dime a dozen singers. She can be replaced by anyone at least image wise. Her voice on the other hand is a diamond in the rough. She sounds incredible on this album. While I don't agree with the clothing (or lack of) that she wears I feel that hey if you're grown then it's your business.  <BR>Anyway back to her voice she sounds incredible except for the song that she and Linda Perry did together- \\"Make Over\\". I like the song and everything but this song is more for Pink (who just happened to work with Linda Perry as well.) <BR>This album works in part because of the fusion of different artists that will come to mind once you hear it. \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Make Over\\" scream Pink to me, \\"The Voice Within\\" and \\"I'm OK\\" takes me back to the Mariah songs everyone would run to the store to buy, \\"Impossible\\" reminds me of Alicia's hidden track \\"Love\\" or \\"A Woman's Worth\\" off her own album and \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Keep On Singin My Song\\" will bring to mind the positive images that India.Arie's album conveys. These are a few that came to my mind when I listened to the albulm not that they are bad names to be placed beside of but if you are trying to become your own person or prove that you have already then why should you have to copy the styles of others? Don't get me wrong though the songs on here are great, very positive and good song choices but only one or two (Dirrty and Can't Hold Us Down and maybe Make Over) go along with her whole new \\"sexy\\" appearance. <BR>The message that Christina (I believe) is trying to convey is that she is stripping her good girl image and everything that's not neccessary. She's going back to her bare essentials which are music and the spiritual guidance she has found in others as well as a higher being. <BR>I can't wait until a certain person that she mentions in \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" retaliates with a new song about her. This one should be sweet. :)<BR>As an overall rating I give her 4 stars<BR>For song selection I give her 5 stars <BR>For creativity and artisticness I give her 3 stars (I didn't like the photos inside of the album cover it felt awkward to try to read the songs while there is a person sitting there naked and I hate the back cover-it looks like a bootleg cd cover! I'm not spending $...on a cd to buy a bootleg lookalike!)<BR>I did love the sincerity and personal imput that she put into the album. You can listen to a song like \\"I'm OK\\" and know that this is Christina talking not the record company or a writer.<br />My final overall rating is 4 stars because while I think that it is a good second effort I don't believe that she accomplished the goal that she set out to. With her voice capabilities she could do even better. There's no reason why she can't sing and write beautiful, eclectic songs and keep her clothes on too.
B00CH26TL8|3|I  played this in the past @ King.com and liked it very much but this is different somehow from that version - not as enjoyable to play. But I guess you can't complain when it's free
B001CEE1YE|5|great series in blue ray
B00BP4X3W2|5|Sophomore son watched it for his Western Civilization class.  He very much appreciated the movie.  He is a World War II buff.
B007ZGBZHE|5|What can be added to describe the true literary genius of these story tellers. This was a masterpiece of intertwined lives, personal tragedies and devious long term plans of biblical proportions. The canvas was stretched, the paint applied and the story emerged, magnificent.
B00DA9PX0A|5|Took me back to my high school years; fear, failure, and most of all love! Great book to bring you back to the sights and smells of your first love!
B00N1W3O1G|5|We are all getting 'mellow' in our advancing years.  Neil still &#34;has it&#34;!
0393351599|5|Absolutely fantastic read! This book captivated me and led me to finish the book within a couple days, which is rare for me. I enjoyed the style in which its written, and will be reading more Michael Lewis in the future. I already bought another by him.
B000A2RRF4|5|I was already a teenager when The Jackson 5 came along, but I was swept up with their act and the brilliance of a 11 year old Michael (who looked even younger than that).  I saw them perform live in LA at the Forum.  After that I moved around a lot so I never got to see Michael perform solo.  I regret that, but I'm proud to say I'm still a fan.  This concert is awesome and well worth buying and watching.  If you can't see his  talent, you just aren't paying attention.  I recommend this DVD.  My only question... this was the Dangerous tour... and yet.. Michael never performed \\"Dangerous\\" during the concert... however it's still worth owning.
B00AREIAI8|1|This would have been a 5-star game but for the constant, annoying ads that start popping up once you're about 15 levels in.  Not quite sure what the game designers are trying to accomplish by ruining the game with these silly ads - it hasn't convinced me to purchase their other games and in fact has convinced me to stop playing this game.  It's a completely asinine and ineffective marketing ploy.  If I could give this game 0 stars, I would.
B004H4XDBI|5|Three years…..that’s how long it’s been since Mia walked out of Adam’s life. When she left for Julliard and never looked back. Leaving Adam a shell of the person he once was.<br /><br />Both have carried on. Mia has become an accomplished violinist at Julliard. Adam is living in LA and excelled to rock star status. Losing Mia has left the stardom bittersweet. Adam no longer feeling the music…becoming a tabloid topic.  Then fate finds a way to intervene.<br /><br />During the middle of a tour, Adam finds himself stuck in New York. Thinking of what he once had, Adam makes the decision to watch Mia in concert. Despite his attempt at staying hidden, Adam is asked backstage. The two decide to spend one last night together…exploring the city that is now Mia’s home. Both try to ease the pain of their past by opening up about what went so wrong after the accident.<br /><br />Okay….I was obsessed over reading this book. I was still reeling from the way the first book - If I Stay - ended. What a journey these two characters have been a part of….especially Adam. The loss he felt at the complete abandonment of his relationship with Mia will grip the very essence of your soul. As Adam explores his past and his future, we are left to wonder why these events took place. Mia’s confessions shed light on so many questions about the past. These two explore the loss, despair and reconnection of their love. It was a beautiful and touching ending to the fork in the road.
B007R41E8O|4|This a really well made point and click hidden object hybrid. I don't care for pure hidden object games because they don't really force you to use your brain. However, this game strikes a good balance between the two genres. The hidden object sequences are used to provide you with an item you need to solve a puzzle and progress the story. Each hidden object scene is used at least a couple of times and you need to pay attention to what is in the scene as you may need it later in the game. If you've been paying close attention then you'll know just where to go to find the item you need.<br /><br />The game is much longer than similar games I've played such as Lost City and Grisly Manor, which is a plus. I think this game is superior in the graphics department as well.<br /><br />Many people have mentioned that the ending is confusing or doesn't make any sense. I actually thought it made perfect sense and was an interesting twist.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this game 5 stars is because it crashes a lot. Fortunately it autosaves often and I never lost more than a minute or two of progress. Overall, I highly recommend this to all fans of the genre.
B0041KKYDI|3|It was a remarkable story of survival in a desperate situation, I guess if a situation like this ever happens to me, I will remember this movie and hope that I can be as strong.
B000AMJG4Y|5|I Love this movie.  It is so real and life like that I find myself watching it so much that my children complains, (smile) no matter, this is one movie I recommend to anyone who is looking for action and a good story line to make the action make sense. Cloud is my favorite character and his crew if off the hook.  I say go to your computer right now and go to amazon.com and place your order right away. it's a good buy.
B003HFFVDQ|4|As soon as the first sounds emerge you know you are listening to The Chemical Brothers. This album is true to their style. It is a little pop and instantly likeable. All tracks are good and I rate the album an easy 4 stars however it would be easy to over listen and get quickly bored.
B00092QUQC|5|This is an absolutely fantastic album. The band comes from Switzerland and they rock. They went back to there original style of melodic hard rock on this one like there first three albums. If you like there early stuff you will like this a lot. I recommend it very much and give it 5 stars.
B00BF11STU|3|It was not as exciting as i thought it would be, and the plot  seemed to drift at times in my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Good game .
B004ULEEY8|4|Nothing earth shattering, just a good gunfire and explosion movie that is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
B00I2TV3NO|3|Didn't like the ending
B00NEQRNVG|5|I love the characters, love the story. Can't wait for the next one. So much more to be expected...hurry! Please.
0316055433|5|The price was spectacular and the delivery great.  I don't suppose I am being asked to review the book, but it to is one of my better reads in a long time.  I will have to look back to Ms. Tartt's other books.
B00OIK4C5C|5|Motown meets the 21st century! WOW! Meghan could be the next Amy Winehouse (style) but without the drugs and issues :) Love the beat but let's get more orchestration and variety. Superstar!!!
B00CFYAT6O|5|What a great CD!  I am a huge Tedeschi Trucks fan, and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this CD.  And wow, it does not disappoint!  The entire CD is fantastic--have listened to it 10 times in 24 hours, and I'm still amazed.  If you are a blues fan, you love (obviously) great guitar talent and beautiful smoky, blues-y vocals, you will LOVE this CD.  TTB just keeps getting better!!
0671578278|5|I loved this book. It had everything gut splitting humour, food fights, political intrigue, and regency romance. It's one of those books that once you start reading it you just can't stop and when you do finish you want  more. I want more and so will you.
0920668372|5|It took a long time for me reading this book multiple times to finally be able to read it without crying or at least not profusely. My daughter is not in love with the book as I hoped but I think it's more that she just loves all kinds of books. I bought a recordable Love You Forever book from hallmark so that I could record my voice reading the book as a keepsake for my daughter. I haven't been able to record it yet because I still get a little choked up....
0307938905|5|I listened to the audiobook version of The Night Circus. The narrator, Jim Dale, is absolutely wonderful. He paces the words well, and though his voice is quite distinct, he adjusts it well to reflect each character. Erin Morgenstern's story is good, but the way she weaves her words is magical. Others have compared her writing style to Neil Gaiman's, and although the themes on which Morgenstern focuses are very different than Gaiman's, I agree that they both have that mysterious and magical quality to their work.<br /><br />In a novel with so much amazing backstory and world to reveal, it would be easy to bore the reader with too many details or overly expositional dialog, but Morgenstern's writing walks the fine line where these elements are just right. The book left me dreaming about the world of the circus.
B00F031X62|4|Once agian the Hendrix family have dipped into the vault to grab a handful of not particulary great tracks from Jimi and release them knowing that the Hendrix faithful will flock to get the album.  I did and while there was one new song on the album, most of the tracks you know backwards and forwards and sideways to boot.  It's okay but if you get this as a holiday present you will probably be disappointed.  Get the documentary instead.
B00000IPAX|5|This album is so great and diverse. There are no two songs that sound the same, which I can't really say for their previous album: Dude  Ranch (even though that, too is a great album) My personal fav is Cheshire Cat, but  this is up there, too. They have obviously matured a lot (musically, not  lyrically) My favorite songs are Going Away to College, Adam's Song, All  the Small Things, Wendy Clear, and, until the trendy pop station  over-played it, What's My Age Again?
B00008EY65|3|HELLBOY features great cinematography and film-making elements and has a GREAT first 30 minutes.... but after that it just sort of plods along as a half-hearted mix of comedy, drama, lovestory, hero comic story.<br /><br /> I was not familair with the cult popularity of the HELLBOY comic before this movie.<br /><br /> In general I don't like the way Hollywood throws so much COMEDY into hero movies.<br /><br /> I would like to see a &quot;comedy free&quot; Hero adaption one day.<br /><br /> It seems Hollywood likes to toss comedy into every type of movie these days... Horror, Action, Hero, etc...<br /><br /> It's a good rental and is better than many films these days.<br /><br /> I respect the work and effort that went into making the film, BUT I will probably never watch it again or add it to my permanent DVD collection.<br /><br /> It just didn't grab me enough to watch again or to remember.
0375758992|5|I read \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" a few years back. It's an incredible, haunting book about Alexandra Fuller growing up in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe during a time of great turmoil. This book is a keeper. In looking through other books on Amazon/Kindle this morning I came across this one and realized I'd never written a review on it. So I had to do it. This is so good that it should be made into a movie.
B008JMKN4Y|1|I have never been so relieved to finish a book.<br /><br />From the rating, I thought it would have some redeeming value...but it doesn't. And I'm a pretty generous when it comes to the criticism of books, so that's really saying something. I have never cringed or rolled my eyes or shook my head at a story more, and some parts honestly made me angry.<br /><br />There were countless problems; here's just a few:<br /><br />- No plot. Like at all. Two people meet, hang out, don't want to get together, but can't resist (of course), break up, get back together, break up, get back together, realize they are not good for each other and would never work, get back together...x10.<br /><br />- The main guy, Travis, has serious psychological problems, and I'm not saying that as an exaggeration - he has several manic outbursts, is manipulative, he beats people up for just looking at Abby, beats people up for cash, tells her what she can and cannot wear, tells her who she can spend time with, trashes a room because she left the apartment after sleeping with him, is constantly insecure and obsessive about Abby's attention on him and him only, gets a tattoo of her name despite their tumultuous relationship (over the span of a couple months), etc. If the book was about Travis' issues and how he had to cope with them, then that would be acceptable, but I got the feeling the author thought his issues made him manly and bad-ass. In reality, Travis would most likely end up in prison at a young age, which is so romantic, I know.<br /><br />- Abby is somehow the force of change for Travis (well, he's still a violent, insecure, controlling person all the way up until the end, so that's relative), yet her character is almost indefinable, with no consistent personality. But the hot campus bad boy somehow wants to marry her at first sight.<br /><br />- In the span of one chapter, Abby goes from &#34;I'm over this, I hate you&#34; to laughing and saying &#34;I love you&#34;. Pretty sure this happens three times.<br /><br />- Constant and unnecessary degradation of women, frequent use of words, &#34;bimbos&#34;, &#34;sluts&#34;, etc, all the while glorifying what a sex god Travis is.<br /><br />- The fact that Abby's mysterious past had potential to be interesting, but it was largely used as filler.<br /><br />- The ridiculous, ridiculous ending. When I look back on it, it actually fits the ridiculousness of the book.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my time reading this book, so please don't waste yours.happens three times.<br /><br />- Constant and unnecessary degradation of women, frequent use of words, &#34;bimbos&#34;, &#34;sluts&#34;, etc, all the while glorifying what a sex god Travis is.<br /><br />- The fact that Abby's mysterious past had potential to be interesting, but it was largely used as filler.<br /><br />- The ridiculous, ridiculous ending.

038553082X|5|It breaks the mind open, and explains in layperson's language how it works now, and will in the future. I have turned a number of people on to it.
B002BWP49C|5|I loved it!  They have matured into beautiful people/vampires.  Loved the storyline & Plot.  Graphics were awesome.  Leaving you wanting more.  Definitely worth buying and watching over and over again.
B006ID6NDQ|4|This was a very well written account of one woman's ordeal in Nazi Germany during WW-II. It is a shame that she was forced to give up such a promising future do to nationalized bigotry.
0316666343|5|I read &quot;Lucky&quot; in one evening, and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is just as masterful. You will fall in love with Susie as she tells her story from heaven. You will thank heaven that we have a writer like Alice Sebold.
B00E9A656K|4|Great way to kill some time. Would be better if you didn't have to spend your own money on it though. Free games should be free. Otherwise very fun and gets addictive easily.
B005DI994W|3|While it has the expected jingoistic/nationalist tone for a British film made on the eve of WWII, it's actually a bit more cynical and somber than many such films made contemporaneously.  The focus is more on personal duty, honor, and friendship than \\"national service\\".<br /><br />While the plot is somewhat routine, there are moments that elevate it and the performances are good.  The battle sequences are good but (obviously) lose some impact on the small screen.  It may be apocryphal, but real British soldiers (in period outfits) and real dervishes were used as extras, and it is claimed that the British rifles were loaded in case the dervishes got \\"carried away\\" during filming.<br /><br />There is the usual casual racism of the era in the portrayal of any non-Europeans and the usual stilted dialogue of 30's films, but neither of these issues ruins the film.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed Lawrence of Arabia should find enough to appreciate in this film, although it obviously isn't anywhere in the same league.
B00U7VDC7A|5|Interesting game.
0684830515|5|I have always wanted to read Hemingway, that is when I have time. Yes, when i have time and yes like everyone that needed time never presents itself :). but again, i had no choice this time becasue this book was assigned to me. And for the first time i see how effective the brevity can be, and the beauty of using ordinary words. Hemingway should have won Noble Prize more than once!
B00005JKJA|4|It's hard to believe this film started out as a pilot for a series on ABC (I have no idea why Lynch keeps making material for them, considering their history).<br />It has to be seen to be appreciated - multiple times.<br />Lynch doesn't wrap everything in a nice neat package, for that matter, he never makes any promises that the experience will make sense. It's just art being what it is.<br />However, the import verisons of this DVD (the Korean one is Region 0 so it can be played anywhere) have tons of extras not on the domestic disc! (Which is the ONLY reason this disc doesn't get the full 5 stars.) Namely interviews with the cast... I'll likely be importing it, at additional expense.<br />Now if they'd just hurry the heck up with the Lost Highway and Wild at Heart DVDs...
0606040439|5|I never thought that picking up a science fiction book (this was my first) would open my life to a classical education!  I read the Trilogy.  Then I went on to read the real Demosthenese, then the Campaigns of Alexandar by  Arrian, then Heroditus...  Card has given his characters lives that fit in  with our own ancient mythology.  A fine sequal to the ancients!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Very entertaining season. Haven't finished but so far, so good. I was very surprised by some of the themes that are touched upon this season.
B00FEMJF6O|4|I started on my pc then started on here,very enjoyable. Only drawback is you can't tap to start your apples or your cows,you tap and slide ,be it worth the fun.THUMBS UP
B000FBFN1U|5|Another fantastic addition to the series!  Martin does an excellent job at providing unexpected twists and turns to keep you hanging on!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I normally do not even attempt to purchase, much less read books about people who have cancer and die but I had heard so much of this one, I took the chance and read it. I am a super slow reader. I read this book in 3 days. It is awesome. The characters are so real and true to form. I love the way John Green writes!  Such an easy read. I enjoyed it greatly.
B006FO3ERQ|3|Too long, but stayed with it to the end.
B0013FXWU6|5|I like basically any movie that Daniel Day Lewis appears in and this is no exception. The actor, Paul Dano, was previously unknown to me, but he did a fine job portraying the Sunday brothers here. There Will Be Blood may not be faithful to Upton Sinclair's original story but it is a compelling portrait of evil in this world. I always laugh at those who think human beings are more good than evil. I have never seen any evidence for this being true in the course of my life. Evil is capable of corrupting us all, and Lewis's Daniel Plainview is a haunting portrait of a man who emits villainy the way most of us emit carbon dioxide. For this reason, Paul Thomas Anderson has put together a classic and valuable movie. I admit that it wasn't pleasant to watch but it certainly was excellent.
B00GTCECVG|5|EPIC MUST GET
B00BWBHIUG|5|I have become totally addicted to this game. I own fresh water tanks with &quot;live&quot; fish so having a virtual saltwater reef rocks! Not to mention Nemo &amp; friends.<br />I don't like the derrogatory msg's from Stanley.<br /> 1-it's bullying us into buying something we may not want in our reef.<br />2- bullying and guilt trips in a game is an unethical practice for all ages. Surely your writers are clever enough to encourage item quest's without belittling your audience.<br />3- Pearls???? unless we buy them with real money...they have no incentive thus no purpose. Perhaps an oyster?
B006885LZM|5|Sensational
0312265859|5|Evanovich continues to deliver the funny escapades of Stephanie Plum.  Each novel introduces new characters that enhance an already great cast.  Hard Eight is no exception.  As I read this one I kept thinking these things would only happen to Stephanie.  Evanovich keeps coming up with antics that could only happen in her novels and make you buy into them.  Nothing about these novels seem contrived or manipulated, just good fun.  I can't wait to read number nine.  A year is tooo long a wait for news of Stephanie.
B009HUB40Y|5|Love this game keeps your interest.
0446607274|4|Angels Flight is not as good as Void Moon, but it is still a great crime novel. Connelly is your better-than-average crime/suspense novelist and he  doesn't disappoint with Angels Flight. <br />Harry Bosch is great &amp; the  story basically is about the murder of 2 people, one being a high-profile  lawyer. It is better than just your average 'whodunit' as it is still  political enough to be interesting and still clever enough to keep you  guessing throughout the book, with enough twists to make it  believable.<br />After a few crappy crime/suspense novels that I have read in  the last couple of days, Connelly was just the ticket to get me back into  great ones again &amp; I have just ordered all his books!
B009CPES4I|5|Lots of twists, with Bill Nighy giving an riveting, can't turn away performance as a husband trapped but who is painfully loyal.
0345803485|2|I'm a man in my mid-twenties. I studied Economics and Mathematics in college, but I've always had a keen interest in porn, and what the experience of watching sexually explicit media reveals about us. A few of my acquaintances recommended 'Fifty Shades of Grey' to me, so I decided to read it. In my life, I have dedicated a significant portion of the little attention I can muster to porn, and I always wondered about the possibility of porn as mainstream media content. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a mega-hit bestseller novel, and it was introduced by mainstream news media quite frequently, so I was curious whether this novel could show me the form of porn that I have been wondering about.<br /><br />After the first reading, I'm very thoroughly disappointed. It is not the fact that the hero is pretty much Clark Kent and Wonder Woman's lovechild that inherited Tony Stark's money that bothers me. My main issue is that the sex scenes are incredibly boring. There is no persuasive enough narrative that tells the reader why that woman orgasms every 2 seconds, yet they keep coming. When we encounter porn, we do not seek for realistic plots or characters, but we do seek for realistic orgasms, and blandly telling the reader that 'she had an exhausting orgasm' simply is not enough to persuade him that she in fact had an 'exhausting' orgasm. Porn loses everything when its descriptions of sexual sensation lose their persuasiveness. Once that happens the screams lose their human aspect, and become long and torturous screams of deception that force your brains to start working again and come up with another search keyword. A painful experience.<br /><br />Its character development is excruciatingly lacking, and its narrative falls short of any standard. This book fails to make a true connection with the reader. It fails to be what a story should be, which is a medium that connects the reader to an experience or an understanding. I am forced to be puzzled by those that profess to have experienced arousal or vivid sexual tension through this book, as in my mind this book is incapable of mediating any sort of such experience.<br /><br />It is not porn. If it is, it is bad porn. It is closer to something I would see in fan fictions written by 12 year old kids. Nevertheless it is labeled as porn, and I find that insulting to the long tradition of porn that so many people have cherished. Granted, this is my first read, but I expect that if there ever is a second reading I'll come back with a longer review of more disappointment.

B002CGSYNU|1|I wish I knew the correct lens cap for the Olympus 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens.<br /><br />This cap is too big.<br /><br />==== More news from Olympus web site ====<br />It turns out that I have the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II. The \\"II\\" was not marked on the lens you just have to know!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II was introduced as the kit lens for the Olympus PEN E-PL2. It retains the versatility of its predecessor and features three additional benefits. This lens is designated MSC (Movie-Still-Compatible), which means it utilizes a nearly silent focusing technology that is all but imperceptible when recording HD movies. It also has an increased autofocus speed when capturing still images. Finally, the lens supports M.Zuiko conversion lenses and optional ø37 mm filters, all of which attach to the lens via a bayonet mount located underneath the decoration ring at the end of the lens. This lens is narrower and lighter than the original with a diameter of 2.2 inches (56.5 mm) and a weight of 3.9 oz (112 g). When retracted, this lens is 1.9\\" (50 mm) in length.<br /><br />The following Olympus accessories are compatible with this lens:<br />* LH-61C and LH-40 lens hoods<br />* LC-37B front lens cap<br />* LR-2 rear lens cap<br />* PRF-D37 ø37 mm Protective Filter<br />* MCON-P01 Macro conversion lens<br />* WCON-P01 Wide-angle conversion lens<br />* FCON-P01 Fish Eye conversion lens<br /><br />The M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II R was introduced as a kit  lens option bundled with the E-P3, E-PL3 and E-PM1. The specifications  of this model are identical to its predecessor, and it accepts all of  the same Olympus accessories, including the lens hoods, M.Zuiko conversion lenses and ø37 mm filters. However, exterior elements were redesigned in order to match the more modern look of the new trinity of Olympus PEN cameras. The textured grip features narrow horizontal bands around the circumference of the lens barrel, rather than the vertical bands of varied widths that run lengthwise along the barrel of the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II and M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6. Also, the lens is a solid color (black or silver), where  the previous version had a silver mount on the black-bodied lens.l of the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II and M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6. Also, the lens is a solid color (black or silver), where  the previous version had a silver mount on the black-bodied lens.
B00BF124PC|5|Good back story on the Intel gathered for the operation and not just about the raid itself, more then the special forces side of the story.
B003YGSLDA|4|Is this the best movie ever made? No it isn't. However I would hate to see someone pass this movie over because a review said this was a awful movie. This movie is a typical christmas movie, its there not to really wow someone with a story or effects but to explore another place in our memories and answer a few questions that we may have about a magical season. However I don't want to sell this movie short! The story of Santa has been told many times and we see him created from a mere mortal or we see him in modern times dealing with the realities of today. Whats unique about this movie is that it gives as a look at the evolution from the basic wooden toymaker to the man who brings us bikes and video games. No we don't see the toyshop turn into a video game studio but we get to see how Santa has remained timeless even though we may not have. I find it very hard to believe that even the cold hearted wouldnt get a little choked up when Santa takes his first flight, or when he is awed by the toys waiting for delivery. I realize this is not a Christmas classic yet like WhIte Christmas or Its a Wonderful Life however this movie has something we can only attribute to magic surrounding the Christmas season.

B007K3JCAE|3|I've got to concur with the review that talks about pawning off an online \\"UltraViolet\\" license as a digital copy. I've played around with this technology and it is not ready for prime time. I don't want to have to go to multiple places to watch movies that I've purchased.  If I want to watch a movie on my iPad/iPhone, then I should be able to launch it from the Video's App.  I shouldn't be forced to go into some buggy 3rd party app to stream a movie that I theoretically purchased.<br /><br />But in all honesty, I feel Warner Bros in general has not been playing fair in regards to \\"Digital Copies\\".  Even prior to UltraViolet, they often distributed digital copies with new releases but only allowed a very short time frame to redeem those copies via iTunes or for use in Windows Media Player.  In my case, I always bought the more expensive Combo packages in part to get the digital copy.  However, I just started redeeming those digital copies recently after getting an iPad. With almost every studio, I didn't have a problem redeeming the digital copies - even if the blu-ray or DVD was several years old.  But I was locked out of almost every Warner Bros digital copy because it was \\"expired\\".  The expiration date was listed on the disk, but in fine print.  I find it ludicrous that an unused digital copy redemption code should ever expire.<br /><br />But back to the movie - Sherlock Holmes 2 was a very entertaining movie, though I felt the first movie had a more logical flow. And with Sherlock - logic is EVERYTHING.  This movie seems to move from scene to scene often with very tenuous connections and a thin plot to hold things together.  But with that said, Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law are both great in the movie and it's the quintessential popcorn movie to enjoy on a Friday night.<br /><br />My new philosophy - if a movie comes with a true Digital Copy, then I'll buy the blu-ray combo pack.  If it comes with a UltraViolet copy, I'll bypass the blu-ray and just buy the 1080pdigital copy on iTunes.
B008BIZ06M|5|This album shows off a more mature band. The songs are well written, produced, and polished. There is not a track on the album that I do not like.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is exactly like floppy birds original. it even has different colored birds. Plus the bird s*** diff colors of poop.

B007J4T2G8|4|I must confess that I could NOT read this book in public due to the many face expressions I pulled while reading this book. Just WOW. Even though the other two books are better this one is just... raw, which makes it just \\"special\\".
B007J4T2G8|5|Not my usual reading taste, but I could not put this book down. Would recommend to mature persons since the content is racy!
B005LAII9Y|4|I really enjoyed this Tim Burton/Disney movie.  It is about a boy (Victor) and his dog (Sparky), his parents, and his basic life (schoolmates, neighbors, teacher).  They live in New Holland, where Victor's only interests are Sparky and science.  Mr Burgemeister (the Mayor, aka Dutch) is an old grouch and complains that Sparky sniffed his flowers and peed on his lawn flamingo.  Sparky and the Lady Poodle next door have the dog-hots for each other.  You can figure from the promo what happens in the basic storyline.<br /><br />It is done in the general Tim Burton cartoonish format.  Victor looks very much like Johnny Depp.  One of the classmates reminds you of Peter Lorre with a hunchback.  The science teacher is something like Boris Karloff.  The movie parodies Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Pet Cemetary.  Although not a comedy, I had two laugh-out-loud moments.  Good entertainment.<br /><br />Not for the very little ones, because of the grief/sorrow piece and some cemetary-related issues that may scare them.  (Really not a  children's movie anyway.)
B00JP5GRVM|4|My husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's sort of light and funny and has you wanting Walter to be happy. Would recommend.
B000002UDV|5|What more can I add? Opening with &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice?&quot;, the album/cd is a virtual masterpiece, and includes one of the most beautiful popular songs ever recorded, &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. If you haven't  ever heard it then your musical education is NOT complete.
B002N5N4EE|5|The first time I saw Ghost Whisperer on TV I was HOOKED! The story lines behind the series episodes continue to fascinate and intrigue me. These story lines lead to the next installment in such a subtle yet powerful way that I can hardly stand the wait until the next episode.    Jennifer Love Hewitt is the perfect acting match for anyone having the ability to communicate with the Spirits...think me crazy, but I believe there ARE people out there who do exactly what she does. I had an out of body experience when I was 5 years old. I was very sick with a fever of 105.6 (according to my parents) and I truly believe I died for a short time. I could clearly see my body laying in the bed as I looked down on it from high above. I witnessed my mother rushing my body to the tub and pouring ice over it until I returned to it. That memory is burned into my mind like it happened yesterday.    As members of my family have passed on over the years, I have always felt a calm, very serene presence in the minutes, hours and up to a few days after their deaths that has made me a true believer of \\"The Light\\" and an afterlife. And because of \\"The Ghost Whisperer\\" I'm not the least bit afraid of death and am actually looking forward to it.    In my humble opinion, every episode has an extrememly emotional cleansing effect that I carry with me for days, weeks, months at a time...some are more powerful than others.    I want to own every single episode of this one.
B00003CY5J|5|Husband loved this thriller!
B00EGMQIJ0|5|Another amazing work by Eggers.
B00QSRT50A|5|So much better in HD
0782008372|2|There are certain rules to making a good movie.  Rule number one clearly states do NOT cast Christopher Lambert.  Putting the fact the he is a terrible actor aside, he is not Scottish.  He does not even try to fake a Scottish accent in this movie.  The only thing this movie has going for it is the strong story line.  Unfortunately, poor acting and '80's movie syndrome kindof ruin it.  It is good for a laugh though.  If only it had been directed by a good director with a Scot cast aws the Scot and a Spaniard cast as the Spaniard...It would be nice to see a remake...
B00H58VGIA|5|Good historical fiction, written in an interesting format using two characters as the narrators. A tremendous amount of research<br />was put into this book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3|I haven't played much because it wont work. ill try craft something and it wont even open the interface. and then it just kind of moves me to a random place not even remotely close to where I started.<br />kind of defeats the purpose of a house if you cant get back to it
B001DE29SS|5|I originally watched this movie in my film class in college, so I did not really think that this movie would be to my liking. But, I thought that the movie was terrific. I was just sitting in awe staring at the screen watching Downey's magnificent performance. So, I had to get a copy for myself, and I am glad I did. I watched it the day I got it, and it was just as amazing as it was the first time!
B008YKGQR4|5|Very happy with the app. its a great experience and it is helpful. thank you for providing great apps :)
B000002JR8|4|I don't get why people say this is one of the heaviest albums ever. Buy a Cannibal Corpse or Morbid Angel album if you think this is the heaviest ever. This is Pantera's heaviest, but it's almost nothing compared to death metal. The solos are getting worse, especially on &quot;Becoming&quot; and &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot;, but it's not numetal. Some of the songs on this album are kind of weird (&quot;Good Friends&quot;, &quot;Throes Of Rejection&quot;) which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. &quot;I'm Broken&quot; is a classic and &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot; is one of their best, while underrated. This is Pantera's second worst, only to &quot;Trendkill&quot;, which only gets 3. If you like this, buy &quot;Vulgar&quot; for more straightforward Pantera or &quot;Trendkill&quot;.
B00I8Q77Y0|3|I thinks it addictive, yet frustrating. For example, you try so many times it makes you want to throw you're kindle I wished that the creater of the game would make more games like this or something else
B001OQCV2O|1|This movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made .It is so ridiculous and implausible. Its even so bad that its not even one of those movies that is so bad that you enjoy it anyway. Its worse than that. Its two hours of my life that I'll never get back......... Don't just avoid this movie RUN AWAY SCREAMING.....
B000089RVX|1|The CD opens with the song \\"Going Under\\". I'm not entirely sure what, precisely, is being gone under, but they seem to be pretty into the whole thing, I guess. There's actually 10 more songs on this disc, though I don't know if that's a fair statement... I think it's actually the one song, re-written and re-recorded 10 times... I couldn't really distinguish much difference, musically, between the first song, and the rest of the songs on the album. Throw in a different filler here, a different chord there, and you have yourself a one-song album that goes on for about 40 or 50 minutes, I'm not entirely sure.<br />All I have to say after wasting my hour (or so) listening to this CD is that the lead singer had better be pretty darn hot, otherwise, I have absolutely no idea why anyone would listen to this garbage. Personally, I think the sound of my feces ploonking in the waters of the toilet (and, perhaps, the subsequent squeak of the handle and whoosh of flushing water) is more musically entertaining than this CD.
B009ZQC7MY|5|The subtle British sense of humor gets better and better as the series goes on--listen closely!  We can't hardly wait for Season 4 to be released to Prime!!
0446310786|5|This book was AMAZING. I thought this would be just another boring book the teacher tells us to read but infact it was very interesting. DO RECOMMEND
6304602979|5|No doubt this is one of my favorite movies.  I was surprised at first to discover that its director was the same guy who made &quot;Top Gun&quot; but it makes a certain kind of sense.  The movie is kind of comic-booky, perhaps a reflection of the innocence and distorted reality of the two main characters-Clarence thinks that Elvis talks to him.  Everything is larger-than-life, and Clarence and Alabama are super cool and beautiful, even-when they're in the midst of a bloodbath.<BR>What really makes this a fantastic movie though, is the way it combines so much cool stuff into a movie without the plot becoming overly complex.  The script is great, the music by Hans Zimmer is great, and all of the little supporting performances-like Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bronson Pinchot-are great.<BR>At times the love story seems a little corny, but Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater do such a good job of selling it that I can believe that they fell completely in love in one night.  In their idealized, cartoony way, they have.
B00CH87HF4|5|Very good game I would recommend it to everyone that likes action games &amp; I would recommend it to all of my friends.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Excellent acting and cast.  I think the best seasons are:<br />1, 4, 5<br /><br />Just didn't care much for Seasons 2 and 3, probably because of the Governor - COULD NOT STAND HIS EVIL CHARACTER.<br /><br />But overall, if you have never watching this series, PLEASE START WITH SEASON 1 and work your way up to the present season OR you won't understand how MUCH each character has changed - AND BOY, DID THEY ALL EVER CHANGE SO MUCH!<br /><br />GREAT acting and storylines; simply a great TV series for those who really love GOOD ACTING.  THIS is why it was the number 1 show on TV for 4 years running, 5 now that I write this review for Season 4.
B00V4JJPKM|1|Dumb. May be enjoyable for kids but since my wife and I are old farts, the movie was way too long; maybe 5 minutes would be OK. Sorry I can't be more positive.
B00I5UHKPA|2|Loved this game till it kept crashing on me. Now I can't get it to run at all. Bummer it was a good one.
B00BVYNSLC|5|It's just as good as everyone says it is.
0307346617|5|I read this book a few days after influenza here in mexico so is like a half reality half fantasy reading :) a like a lot the format and all levels of \\"interviews\\"
B00881VLCE|5|This is a fun way to relax and relieve the stress of the day.  I would give this a try for any one, you can do 3? To 240 pieces all depends on how short or long of time you wish to spend on it. I say what have you got to loose?
B000T4EDXC|2|I thought I would watch this in the run up to the 2014 reboot. A little nostalgia from the 90s and all. Don't do it. It's either a) not as good as you remember it was, or b) even worse than you thought when you first saw it. It just sucks.
B00005JO9J|5|I have been addicted to this show for a year or two now, and was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited when I got this package in the mail. It got here 3 days sooner than anticipated, and arrived on my birthday. Couldn't have asked for anything better! Seller was great to work with, and definitely would work with them again!
B00AIQP9DE|4|Great game, good hints and mini games within! Loved the great graphics. Sound effects were excellent too. Very enjoyable game. I had a hard time putting it down!
B00BEZTMFY|5|I went to see this film in the theater and absolutely loved it for all the usual reasons people like Peter Jackson's work but--to be honest--I prefer it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy because of the emphasis on the story and the characters.  Personally, the battle scenes in some of the previous films went on for too long for me and while this film had plenty of action, it wasn't burdened by it.  Can't wait for the next film!
6305320802|4|Christmas gift from my sister in law wish list so perfect arrived in time and as stated- she is yet to watch
B009FZHYKU|5|Watched the entire season three times! Every time find it more captivating. Love it!!!!!! Looking forward to the next season.

B00687Q0VC|5|Very well-done history lesson! Character development was excellent.
B002NZTZ8S|5|Love it! Great children's movie
B002MQYOFW|5|This book was so good i couldnt put it down! I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0002ZMITY|4|I have no idea why this movie just cracks me up, but it does. Whenever I'm bummed out for no good reason, I turn it on and watching him dance like a dork in that tiny car cracks me up.  He's the biggest goof but thinks he's wicked cool.  <br /> <br />Take it for the fluff entertainment it is and if you like this sort of thing (I normally don't), then enjoy it. If not, pass it by and get something else.
B00K7C17QW|5|I love this game because its really fun and cool.its awesome I mean who doesn't love crime and investigation I mean its awesome the graphics are the best in the game and so are the details I just wish you didn't need stars to investigate or interigate but other then that I love this game:)I also love the fact that its free I mean who doesn't love free;)
B000YHG72E|5|Best holiday movie
B00B6U63ZE|5|This book was recommended by a good friend and it was well worth the time. He said that I would want to take notes; he was right and I did. I plan to recommend The First 90 Days to everyone in my new organization.
0156027321|4|It is a decent novel. The author builds the plot well and the story   is interesting. The author is obviously gifted in weaving a supreme blend of storytelling,characterizations,suspense and an  aura of quiet enlightnment about the human condition. He makes you think about God, purpose of life and the extraordinary spirit of man. Sometimes the details are too tedious. Overall a good book to be savored slowly..
B00028HBKC|4|Great
B005ZOBNOI|5|As a middle-aged person, I wasn't sure about reading this, but some younger friends recommended it. I downloaded it to my phone and read it over the course of a few weeks. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is beautifully written.
B00288KNJU|5|Love this movie
B004EPYZUI|1|Visually stunning at times - yes.  Everything else - terrible.  The plot/story line - unwatchable.  There are much better ways to spend 2.  Period.
B00RY85CQI|5|Well done movie of a historic time and figure. Really tragic how all the secret workers were treated during and after the war. A true war hero abused for preferring men to women. Tragic that he did not let the women who understood him help him. Under told story of the revolution in computing and the rise of symbolic computing and electronic computing. There is still a Turing competition for the most human sounding computer program.<br />Douglas Hoefstdter's article on Alan Turing is available in his collection of Scientific American columns. Metamagical Themas.
B000001EL3|5|KISS had something to prove after the runaway success of &quot;ALIVE!&quot; and they pulled out all the stops for &quot;Destroyer.&quot; First off, they hired Bob Ezrin, who was responsible for forging the chaos of Alice Cooper into a multi-platinum band. They also had never made any bones about the fact that they didn't just want to be stars, they wanted to be MEGA-STARS, so there aren't too many risks involved. (With the exception of recording the strings on &quot;Beth,&quot; perhaps.) They were - thanks to &quot;Alive!&quot; - crowned one of the hardest, greatest working live bands in the world, now they wanted to make it clear they could lay it down on record as well.<br />So into the studio they went, and out popped a semi-conceptual album about each member of the band. There's Paul the Love God (&quot;Do You Love Me?&quot;), Gene the Demon King (&quot;Sweet Pain,&quot; and &quot;God Of Thunder&quot;), Ace the rocker (&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;) and Peter as the sentimental love cat (&quot;Beth&quot;). Ezrin's touch is obvious in the opener &quot;Detroit Rock City's&quot; car/radio/crash sound effects, and of course the squealing kids that pop up in &quot;God Of Thunder.&quot; Layering the production with keyboards and overdubs also brought out the best in the band's compostional skills.<br />Between Ezrin and KISS, &quot;Destroyer&quot; finally shows off the band's musical muscle. Criss' playing in &quot;D.R.C.&quot; is standout, and the band gets crunchy on &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; On the other hand, things gets a little too obvious with &quot;Flaming Youth,&quot; which sounds cribbed from Alice Cooper's Department of the same territory, and &quot;Shout It Out Loud,&quot; tries way too hard to be &quot;Rock And Roll All Night Pt 2.&quot; Save those minor missteps and you have one fine rocking album. &quot;Destroyer&quot; was polished enough to give us long suffering fans the dose of KISS we'd always known they were capable of, gave the band some of the critical respect that was due them, and perpetuated the KISS course to rock domination that they had worked so hard to attain.critical respect that was due them, and perpetuated the KISS course to rock domination that they had worked so hard to attain.

B00CWVG1Z8|4|Liked the plot and story and the characters as well, though there would be a little more sci/fi drama towards the climax but i liked how this eneded.
B009A882D0|3|Okay not a huge fan of CCR, however their contribution to the classic rock scene cannot be questioned.The reason I purchased this particular C.D. is that it has many of their historic songs on it, and it covers nine of their best known albums.<br /> The way that these three C.D.'s are packaged is not the best, but I do like the way the booklet has been placed inside the package set. The sound quality on the first two C.D.'s is good but I have heard better.<br /> My question of WHAT! and the reason for my 3 star rating is WHAT happened to the third live C.D. in this set.Fantasy Record Company have in the past have had decent sounding C.D.'s. However they have dropped the ball on disc #3 in this set, when it comes to good sound quality of live performances. The sound quality is not terribly bad, but it isn't that good either. We as music buying customers should expect more for the money we have to pay out to buy classic rock C.D.'s these days.<br /> COME ON Fantasy Records I know you can do better!<br /> Overall not a bad C.D. if you can get it at a good price,only downer of this set beside the packaging is the sound quality on disc 3 should have been better.<br /> Keep on Rocking!
B005LAII08|5|Clean and family-safe movie that has a good enough story line to keep adults entertained.  This looked really cool in 3D.  If you have 3D capable equipment, I highly recommend this movie in 3D - you won't regret the slight up-charge from standard blue-ray.
B000MRAAJW|5|This is a second hand review. Item was purchased as a gift and receiver loves it. Rated it as a 5 star.
B002WJI63A|5|We got it on time and my kid loves it. good price. looks just like the picture. super cute. thanks.
B00004WLXZ|5|I was watching the closing scenes to Titan AE when the mailman delivered Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will. I subsequently popped it into the DVD  player and decided to give myself a day to mentally change gears after about five minutes.<br />Triumph of the Will covers the 5th to the 10th of September of 1934 in which various aspects of Germany's social rebirth under the Nazi party is celebrated, with stirring speeches by Adolf Hitler and his party associates as to the state of the nation and where it is headed.<br />To convey this artistically, as opposed to a simple news reel type of programme, Leni Riefenstahl employed thirty six cameramen, who shot more than sixty hours worth of film. This raw footage was then edited down to one hundred and seven minutes of running time featuring pans, close-ups, aerial shots, jump cuts, linear and rotating tracking shots, and upward angled shots. To aid continuity, and to embellish the visual rhythm, a heavy musical score was added and underscored by interaction from the crowd.<br />All this ends up as a documentary without a commentator, the speeches and crowd reaction being the only vocal element, the sound carefully edited to the pictures so that the dynamic qualities of the film are reinforced. Some  still advocate the idea that Triumph of the Will was a propaganda / public relations exercise for the Nazi party. But this is an erroneous point of view. <br />My DVD was gotten from Amazon .co.uk. The sound quality was very good to poor. The speeches had the best quality, with heavy applause and chanting coming off the worst due to heavy compression and print through artefacts. The picture quality was decent enough for a sixty eight year old film. My copy claims to be the complete film, and is released by DD video of England, so those who have experienced disappointing DVD releases might find this to be a better choice.
1439138311|4|Eilis Lacey is a young Irish woman, living with her widowed mother and her sister in post-World War II,  economically depressed Ireland.  When a visiting priest from the United States suggests that she could find work in there, she passively accepts her family's decision that she should emigrate.  Initially, she is very homesick, but slowly learns to adjust to her new life and her new independence.  Having fallen in love with an Italian (shock!), she suddenly finds that she must return to Ireland to deal with a death in the family.  There, she must confront her family's expectations for her future, and well as her own.<br /><br />As with all T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's books, this one deals primarily with the themes of privacy and distance, particularly distance between family members.  It isn't so much that people WANT to keep secrets, as that it seems not to occur to them to share their feelings or to discuss their lives.<br /><br />As usual, also, T&oacute;ib&iacute;n writing is perceptive and thoughtful.  His descriptions of Eilis' seasickness on the journey over and her homesickness are unerring.  Here he is on homesickness:  \\"She was nobody here.  It was not just that she had no friends and family; it was rather that she was a ghost in this room, in the streets on the way to work, on the shop floor.  Nothing meant anything.  The rooms in the house on Friary Street belonged to her, she thought; when she moved in them she was really there.  In the town, if she walked to the shop or to the Vocational School, the air, the light, the ground, it was all solid and part of her, even if she met no one familiar.  Nothing here was part of her.  It was false, empty, she thought.\\"<br /><br />Though this is not my favorite of T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's books, I would certainly recommend it.  (A not-great book of T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's is better than most writers' best.)
B00VRYCGLO|2|not sure if i'm playing it right.  i like the tiles, sounds, aesthetics - often when i try to press on matching tiles, it doesn't respond.  i know that you have to eliminate the tiles on top first before the ones on the bottom can pop out, but it has been frustrating so i stopped playing and went back to playing a different mahjong game.
B009CF3P7E|5|This is what actually introduced me into the world of Star Trek - before seeing this I had never really bothered to check it out. It was so amazing that I simply had to see what this was about, and I am not disappointed that I did!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch this!
B007SYWFRM|5|Addicting. Only problem I've encoutered is trying to accept friends on my Kindle. Fun for me and my kids... now my husband has downloaded the game and can't put it down.
B004SJ3AXI|5|awesome with a little frustration but still awesome I just am addicted to this game and this game is some times annoying
0805062971|5|I was given this book by someone who knew how much I liked the movie.  I was a little reluctant to read the book for the very reason that I was such a big fan of the film.  Everyone knows how different books and movies are.  I figured it couldn't be anywhere near as good as the movie so I was a little hesitant.  But I did read it since it was a gift and I'm incredibly glad I did.<br />Never in my experiences have a book and the movie it was based on gone hand in hand so well.  For the most part there are no huge differences, rather things just got rearranged.  I considered what was left out from the book to be like bonus time with the characters that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.  <br />And as a bit of a side note... Everywhere I read this book I had young guys in their late teens and early 20's coming up and telling me how much they loved the book, not just the movie.  To be honest I was surprised that any of them had read the book.  And as much as I loved both the book and the movie I wonder if maybe it did appeal to males more.  Maybe it was just more identifiable with them?  So while I'd suggest to anyone to read it, I would particularly to young men.
B0090XLDKY|5|Great
B00CATONCA|5|Exactly what I expected. I love the show and collect their seasons memorabilia. I can't wait to see what comes out with the new season.
B00000K19E|3|Everybody always told me to watch the Matrix, so I did.  The special effects and the graphics are great.  So are the fighting scenes.  And Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are good actors.  But the movie didn't really do it for me.  I liked A.I. much better (is that a fair comparison??).
B00957T6X6|1|Though it is purchased via amazon, but non of the kindle features differentiate it from a standard mobi
0060776757|5|I think other reviewers are getting bogged down in the process of how the book was created or how cool the photos are. The best part of this book is the words of the four band members themselves. They are candid, open, and honest, and do not pull any punches. I never knew about the deaths of Bono's and Larry's mothers, and the way this unfolds was special. Or how loyal they have been to each other (and to their wide circle of friends). The background in their school days in Dublin was what showed me why they stayed together for thirty years, and why they rely on each other. Yes, the photos are amazing. But it is the stories the band tells themselves which is what makes it precious. This is a coffee table book like no other by a band like no other. I highly recommend you give this book to any U2 fans you know (I bought 3 copies already!).
B006ZAZ31U|5|This book is about a warrior.  It's about a man who went through pure hell and managed to climb to the highest ranking Seal Team in the country. I rarely cry but this book made that impossible.  I cried for Adam and his family and friends.  What a terrible loss.
B0006GVJEE|5|I couldn't believe it once i got home with my new dvd.. <br /> <br />watching this new Leon Deluxe Edition I began to notice new scenes.. Scenes where Matilda starting killing people.. she got drunk, tried to kiss Leon.. asked him for sex.. it was pretty full on and totally unexpected.. and not in any of the other Leon dvds i've seen.. (i have 2 previous versions).. I'd say there is 20 minutes at least more on this disc. The other special features are interesting too..  <br /> <br />So if you want to see some more, uncomfortable yet watchable scenes, do buy this version.
0525478817|5|For my summer reading, I chose to read The Fault In Our Stars.  My sister recommended that I should read this book because she thought I would enjoy the story.  She read the book and told me that she really enjoyed it.  I also had many friends that read the book and told me that I would love the story.  I would recommend this book to another high school reader because most high school student read books that involve a love story and The Fault In Our Stars is a love story that people can relate to.  I would tell them that this book is about a girl who has Cancer and how she thinks that her life won't be special and that nothing good will happen to her.  This book did not meet my expectations because I though that the book would be just a boring book about a girl and her Cancer story, but really it is about a girl and her trying to have a normal life while living with Cancer even though some things might not happen the way she wants them to.
1579126235|5|\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.<br /><br />Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.<br /><br />Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a \\"motley crue\\" - Poirot employs \\"the little gray cells\\" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.<br /><br />There is nothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!<br /><br />Paul Weissnothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread.

B00DPM7TIG|4|Excellent story.
B00CWY76CC|4|A fun hidden objects, puzzle solving adventure!  Yes there were a few challenges but not so challenging that you'd want to walk away.
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is good. It is a quick, easy, mindless read that I find myself thoroughly enjoying. Sometimes a vacation from the everyday ordinary is what we need, this book is just that.
B00000633U|5|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?? It received critical acclaim, and rightfully so. Hard-hitting, but also tender lyrics...Richard Marx is a master songwriter with a killer voice to deliver those great songs that he writes...an unbeatable combo!!! Buy a backup copy....you may need it! I'll buy it on vinyl if it ever comes out in that format, I love it that much!!

B004XWLN20|5|The 10 seasons of Smallville can be broken down as follows:  Seasons 1 & 2  Clark discovers his powers and something of his origin and attempts to deal with it (remember, he is a high school frosh in the first season).  Seasons 2 (last and next to last ep), Season 3, Season 4, & Season 5 (through ep 3) Clark rebels against his destiny and Jor-el, still believing he can have some kind of normal life.  Seasons 5 (from ep 4 on), Season 6, Season 7 (ep 1) Clark resentfully and grudgingly accepts that he is not and will never be normal and gives up on normal relationships and starts to accept some parts of his supposed destiny that Jor-el and others are trying to force on him.  Season 7 (from ep 2 on), Season 8 (ep 1  Clark deals with being an adult who can no longer rely on his parents or surrogate parents and whose relationships are now adult relationships.  Season 8 (from ep 2 on), Season 9, Season 10 (through ep 11) Clark learns how to be a hero and creates his own destiny with aid from and despite Jor-el.  Season 10 (from ep 12 to the finale  Clark is effectively Superman and just has to finish up a few minor details like hiding his secret identity, his final supersuit, and flying.  Let's face it, of all the major superheroes Superman makes the least sense.  Bruce Wayne created Batman in order to terrorize criminals so they felt the fear he did when his parents were murdered.  He is motivated by revenge.  Wonder Woman was created by the Amazons in order to show their solidarity with the Allies against the Nazi threat to the world.  Peter Parker becomes Spiderman, first, to make money as a wrestler, but later as a superhero because of the guilt he feels because he might have been able to prevent the murder of his beloved Uncle Ben and realizes that with great power comes great responsibility.  Clark Kent?  What is his deal?  He becomes Superman because his parents were the salt of the Earth and so he of course becomes Superman.......wait, what?  That is pretty much the story of how Clark Kent becomes Superman in most of the stories in comics, movies, and tv.  There are some variations.  Sometimes he wears tights because they were made by his adoptive mom and sometimes his dad gave him the tights.  Until Smallville live action portrayals of Clark Kent becoming Superman have glossed over his transition.  Before Lois and Clark, the New Adventures of Superman, Clark Kent was the disguise and Superman the real person, which really doesn't make sense because if Clark decides to become Superman before he enters the larger world why not be John Smith?  Why create a Clark who can be traced back to Smallville and potentially lead enemies to his weakness and to his friends and family there?  Lois and Clark gave us a Clark that exists before Superman but it really doesn't give a good reason why dressing up in tights is a good idea and why he should waste his time fighting petty criminals instead of using his powers to end famine or global warming or the many other things he could do in order to save millions of lives.  The glossing over of this transition is most blatant in the historic Superman the Movie where teenage Clark (presumably having graduated from high school) leaves his elderly mother at the farm (after the neighbor has promised to give her a hand) and travels to the Arctic, creates the Fortress and then emerges 12 years later as Superman.  They give no explanation for anything that happened in that 12 year time period and again why does he head to the big city and establish himself as Clark Kent and not John Jones or Jack Sprat or anyone else?    Fortunately, we have Smallville.  Now Superman makes sense.  We know why he decides to become Superman.  We know why he is Clark Kent.  We know why he wears the tights and cape.  We know why he is with Lois Lane instead of spending every waking moment saving lives.  The ten year journey of teenage Clark Kent to the adult Boy Scout known as Superman makes it all come together.  I watched Smallville when it premiered and for the first three seasons.  After that I was too busy and I didn't have much time to watch tv so I missed the rest of Smallville and other shows (Buffy, Angel, Babylon 5, Farscape, etc.).  I did occasionally read comments about it, criticisms of some thing or another like the witches or Lexana but didn't pay much attention.  It was only after I had caught up on other shows I had missed (The Dead Zone, Crusade, etc.) that I remembered I had missed out on much of the last season of Lois and Clark from years ago which gave me some Superman nostalgia. I decided to watch those L&C episodes and then re-watch Superman the Movie and Superman II.  My nostalgia not sated and learning that Smallville was on its last season I thought, \\"Hey, I should watch Smallville.  It was an ok tv show.\\"  I got the first dvd and watched and said to myself, \\"I don't remember this show being this good.\\"  I then got the next disc and the next and hit the end of Season 2 and said to myself, \\"Wow, this is really good.\\"  I learned a valuable lesson, the way to watch Smallville is without commercials.  Sure, that sounds like a lesson for all shows except that Smallville is different.  It has the feel of a theatrical release and not a tv show.  As I watched more episodes I would cringe as I approached episodes that had been roundly criticized by \\"fans\\" of the show and I found that that criticism was not merited.  The Lana possessed by a witch storyline was just fine.  It wasn't bad at all.  It was actually good.  Lana getting involved with Lex?  It made sense.  Clark not telling Lana his secret even though lots of bad guys found out.  Again, made sense.  Clark not flying?  What a stupid complaint, seriously of all the complaints during the 10 seasons this was the dumbest one.  All of this taught me another lesson.  The best way to watch Smallville is with few breaks between episodes.  If a person watched the series regularly they had to endure commercial breaks,cliffhangers that lasted weeks or months and storylines that ran through numerous episodes or even seasons before being resolved along with references to past continuity.  It is no wonder that some people would complain about the actions of a character or something in an episode if they couldn't remember something that happened previously.  By not having a great deal of time pass between episodes the viewer will find Smallville a much more satisfying experience.  Even the actions of Jor-el make a lot more sense within a compressed viewing time frame.  So, to sum up, for the best viewing of Smallville watch at least one episode each day (two or three if it is a season ending cliffhanger).  A final comment.  Smallville is its own world.  It does not have to reflect any past Superman continuity.  In fact, Superman in comics has no real continuity.  He has a number of different origins as do his foes.  A fan of Superman should not be offended that Lois Lane meets Clark Kent long before he is Superman and she is a reporter.  In the Smallville world it works out great.  It isn't as if Lex has hair and Pete Ross is the alien from Krypton.  Smallville has added a number of great things to the Superman mythos that ought to be adopted to the official Superman story and probably will because they make his story so much better.  It will be a long time before we will ever have another comic book legend adapted to tv that is this great (prove me wrong del Toro!).

B00IKZX1ZI|5|Our whole family loves playing! Easy to figure out and fun to challenge each other for 3 stars on each level.
B004SIP71M|5|Meryl Streep .... what else can we say. She deserve every inch of the OSCARS that she received. She was nominated again in this movie but the Academy gave it to someone else that year. I think this is one of her finest performances next to Sophie's Choice.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Love the show! Can't wait for season 4 to come out.  Show is addicting and different genre than prime time tv.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Not a ton of character depth but lots of action and very believable science. I first heard about this book from a Wired article about Andy Weir having written a piece of software to get accurate flight plans and communication delays between Earth and Mars. That kind of accuracy and well thought out technology is consistent throughout. The main character is sometimes very humorous but at times his sardonic attitude is a bit over the top. Despite what flaws it might have I found I couldn't put it down and I can't wait for Andy Weir's next novel.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Love it. I would recommend it definitely. It's been 4 days and I'm actually getting this stuff through my head.
B004FRX0MY|4|Love it so far. Plays a great mix of music & a wider variety than some of the other streaming music services out there. For people with Amazon Prime....this is a must have
B0033TJATW|5|When I first watch this movie here, I had to watch it over and over again. I had view it before I was old enough to purchase on myself.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I read this book in 2 days.  It grabbed my attention from the first page. Loved it
B00H71PHS0|4|Great show. Never know what's going to happen next. Don't like the fact that at any time actor/actresses can up and leave the show, but that's the way they do it other places than the USA.

B00AKOB7CG|5|Def makes me sweat! Easy enough workouts that you don't have to have device right in front of you the whole time, but also like that there's a video showing you how to do the exercise so you don't have to Google it or read a paragraph description..also nice that it tells you how many calories you've burnt after wards
0070511136|5|I can honestly say that this book doubled my income!  I was introduced to the SPIN Selling by a consulting firm, where I was helping launch a new employee selection program.  The most amazing result is that prospects now ASK me to write up the order.  I don't get the objections and resistance that sales people dread.  I now use these techniques in the fields Real Estate and Life Insurance.  Although designed for large, industrial sales situations, SPIN Selling would be equally effective selling cars or home appliances.  You might also use it at your next job interview or performance evaluation.  You will like the results!
B00F8F3J2S|5|Fascinating prologue to today's foreign policy and armor rattling by a sitting president. And the perspective on Putin was almost prophetic of today's theater.
B004Y1WCDE|5|Awesome awesome app to have.  Works perfectly and quickly couldn't be more happy with the product and its awesome features.
B0000C6E4D|3|The wait for Sarah McLachlan's latest release is over. Although her heavenly album, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,&quot; is considered the gold standard, there are a few tracks on this album that are good. As a fan before Fumbling, her sound and lyrics morph and shape themselves by (what it seems) her life experiences like any other artist. This is no different. Sparse and simple, this album has a &quot;take it or leave it&quot;-as-it-is approach. Not entirely bad or entirely great, but worth a spot in your CD collection.
B009XIXVU6|4|Hosseini ties myth to reality in the opening of the book and then continues to blend the reality of a ravaged country, its poverty, privilege and corruption,  with the story of family in all its complexities.  It is an interesting examination of time and place and how his characters are irrevocably effected by their circumstances. Well worth reading.
B005544V6A|5|girlfriend and i are not into legal dramas, but we are absolutely hooked!  each episode leaves you wanting more and you just can't wait to see how each character develops.
B0050DIWFC|4|I enjoyed the story, but gave it a 4 for the unusual ending that made me wonder about the reality of the of the characters.
6305657947|5|I am such an avid movie watcher that I rarely feel inclined to watch a movie more than once.  Well, let me admit to not only having bought the DVD, but to having watched it numerous times!<br /><br />I love the sound track of the movie and will be doing my own remake--going Duo Discus glider riding with my significant other ;).<br /><br />The love scene is wonderful, the chemistry between the actors works like an MIT Lab experiment and the whole movie is simply spot on.<br /><br />I recommend it highly!
1416562605|4|In the interests of full disclosure, I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Adiga on more than one occasion. His self-deprecatory humour is ever-present in this novel, his personality not so much channelled into a single character, as spread across several to varying levels of thickness. One pet peeve would be the inconsistency of narrative voice: the ill-educated son of a rickshaw puller would not be speaking of 'coruscating waters' and 'the heady scent of honeysuckle', however great his unfurling. That aside, the theme of entrapment is deftly-handled. This is no ordinary 'Indian' novel!
B00O5C659O|3|Maybe it's time for them to retire and go away.  I was disappointed...  It's just not up to par with the AC/DC I grew up with...
B004U9J9GS|5|Not a writer's book. A chef's book. A cook's book. Just reading it you know if it would be, or would have been, the life for you. :)
B00005QG9J|5|If you haven't heard the new Incubus cd (Morning View), then you are just not cool.  It is one of the greatest albums of the year and deserves recognition as so.  I bought the cd for the songs &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot;, but I now know that it is much more than that.  It has the hard rock songs that brought us to the band in the first place, but delivers a punch with the soft songs of &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot; Aqueous Transmission&quot; that bring us even more to being a Incubus fanatic.  Then they really give you cold shivers down your spine when you turn on the TV and see one of their videos.  It makes for one great experiences.  The only thing that is better than buying the CD, is buying the DVD AND the CD.  It has it all.  If you buy one CD this year, buy Morning View, you won't be disapointed.  There are some songs that you can listen to only on the radio, Morning View possesses none of these!  It is the Greatest Damn Album This Year!!
B0052U59F4|5|Well, maybe no one really changes who they are inside, but these two people are certainly bringing out a new personality in each other...I cannot wait for the next installment
B004UOCF3W|5|Ditto to all the previous reviews to this album. Unbelievably polished and I continue to be amazed at Dave's talent. Kudos on bringing back Pat Smear. He is the icing on the cake and makes this their best album to date.
B0006JGFNQ|5|My son (3 years old), was happy and surprised he received this gift from Santa.  He walks with his magwah every where he goes and it is a perfect size for him.  Delivered in time and in excellent conditions.
B00HVJB4VM|5|I found this book to be very interesting and exciting to read. It tells the story about a number of individuals involved in high frequency stock and commodity trading. It concentrates mainly on one man who discovers these skimming operations and tries to clean it up by creating a new exchange. It is well written by a very knowledgeable author. If you are interested in Wall Street stuff you'll enjoy this book.
B009NH6AOQ|5|Great
B0063IH60K|4|I enjoyed this app on my first kindle so much that I loaded it on my new kindle as soon as I got it. The only downside is I will never get a high score again since people are solving some games in under 30 seconds.
B00005JKN9|4|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is director, Martin Scorsese's attempt to bring his zeal for Mafia style film making to the by-gone era of turn of the century New York.  The film stars Daniel Day Lewis, in a masterful performance and Leonardo DiCaprio, in one that is \\"less than\\" as opposing members of rival gangs ready to rumble during a much publicized slaughter that has its basis in history.  However, the film's plot, like that of James Cameron's Titanic, relies heavily on romance and fiction to get its point across, skirting around history and using it only as a backdrop.  The CGI rumble sequence in the film is really obvious.<BR>Transfer wise: a nice job overall, enhanced for widescreen televisions. Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Black levels are deep.  Fine details are well defined.  There is some minor edge enhancement present and a bit of shimmering but nothing to get in the way of the performances, such as they are. The sound is 5.1 and aggressive, with deep bass and a powerful punch in the surround channels.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: I'm at a loss to explain why Leonardo DiCaprio gets thrown into \\"historical epics\\".  He's out of his element and the film borders on pure romantic tripe, gussied up to look like history.  As entertainment alone, you might find something to take away from the experience, but I prefer Scorsese when he sticks to thugs that dress in three piece suits instead of suspenders and top hats!
B0054JZC6E|5|fun give it a try fast paced fun for all hard to put down get it already need I say more

B005HI4LMS|4|We've had Tucker & Dale vs. Evil sitting in our Netflix queue for awhile. One of our friends liked it so much that - during the movie - she sent us a note encouraging us to see it.  You don't get that kind of endorsement every day, so we set aside time to watch it.  We were not disappointed.<br /><br />Where to start?  I was crestfallen when Reaper went off the air, so I was delighted to see Tyler Labine back in lovable form as Dale, a hillbilly with a heart of gold. His love interest is the gorgeous but underused Katrina Bowden (of 30 Rock) as Allison. Dale's best friend Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and a bevy of college morons rounds out the cast.  The college kids are off to a party in the woods which just happens to coincide with Tucker and Dale's plans to revamp their \\"vacation home.\\" When the two groups meet at a gas station - Dale forgets to put down the scythe in his hands when he tries to politely meet the college beauties - things don't go well.<br /><br />If this sounds like the plot of a typical horror movie (well, minus the \\"vacation home\\" part), it is.  When Tucker and Dale visit the rundown cabin it's a spitting image of the cabin from Evil Dead. It seems the cabin is in the same area as The Memorial Day Massacre, which Chad (Jesse Moss) recounts in curiously lurid detail.  It's not long before everyone decides to go skinny dipping (of course). Things go hilariously wrong from there.<br /><br />Tucker & Dale alternates between showing typical horror tropes from the college kids' perspective and then giving them perfectly innocent (if unlikely) explanations for them from the hillbillies' perspective. The college kids are convinced the hillbillies are the murderers from the Memorial Day Massacre. Conversely, it's not long before the two buds are convinced the kids are part of a suicide pact, hell-bent on taking everyone with them.<br /><br />The movie pivots on the relationship between Dale and Allison; less likeable leads would have ruined the movie, but here they're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore. As appealing though the burgeoning romance between the furry hillbilly and the blonde college co-ed is, it's the best friends who really cement the movie. Tucker and Dale's relationship never flags even when one of them starts losing appendages.<br /><br />The one element that works against the film is the titular \\"Evil\\" of the title.  It's not hard to spot who is the real villain and unfortunately Tucker & Dale telegraphs him a little too early.  That doesn't detract from the careful plotting and clever script, which delivers on all its promises.<br /><br />Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a love letter to cult horror fans that's not afraid to throw a little love into the plot too.  If you're a fan of Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, or any of their successors you won't be disappointed.hey're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore.

1616960922|4|A short, quick, read. Sanderson's books are interesting because they are different in terms of magic systems and have solid characters. Good plot twists, but never hard to follow. 4 stars after first read, but may be higher after a reread. Desire to reread is the highest compliment I can give.
B000I9U8VO|5|I will give X2 a million + stars! It is an amazing movie and definitly one of my favorite movies ever!

B0034G4ORM|4|I watched \\"Battle For Los Angeles\\" and it was the worst!  Straight to dvd wasn't enough to save this movie!  \\"Battle:Los Angeles\\" was entertaining and actually provided battle sequences with aliens.

B002HJ9PTO|5|Bought these (5) for my High School Journalism & Broadcasting Class. As long as you stay on top of battery management (i.e. turn them off) they work quite well. And they are inexpensive enough that when a student rips the mic off the cable by walking away and forgetting to unclip it you don't have to sell donuts at the corner to replace it.

B005D9MUWY|5|I had a feeling Amazon would make this great app the free app of the day sooner than later.  I just paid full price on Monday for it, but I have no regrets.  I'm happy to support this developer because of the work they have put into this keyboard app.  I have tried several keyboard apps on my new EVO 3D, which comes with Swipe built in.  I don't really care for Swipe that much, but did enjoy using FlexT9 until I ran across the SwiftKey Beta.    I'm more of a one finger typer on these smaller keyboards and SwiftKey X works best for me.  As it has been mentioned, SwiftKey X learns your writing style and predicts what you are going to write.  Almost reads your mind!!    So if it's free, $2, or full price, this keyboard app is worth adding to your Android phone.

B00AREIAI8|5|Super fun and entertaining, yet not too complicated. The best house game I have ever played on kindle or android or Apple.
B001KWTBVQ|4|This movie use to be on Amazon Prime Instant, no longer it seems to be.  Not sure why they changed it to a rental/buy only.
B002SJIO5E|5|District 9 is an edge of your seat, suspenseful movie. It's really cool the way it's filmed as a documentary based on aliens living in a secluded section of South Africa. The acting is great and there's excitement all the way through, even though some of the scenes are kind of  gross. My advice is enjoy this movie WITHOUT popcorn. You definitely want to eat after it's over! Even so, I love this movie and highly recommend it.
B000003N7K|4|an interesting album in the Coltrane discography. back in the early 60's, people kept waiting for John to unleash his furious free jazz sound into the world; but he baffled everyone by releasing a set of standard soft albums of exquisite ballads. this duet album with Johnny Hartman was one of them. and what a pair they make. i am not a fan of vocal jazz, but Johnny's velvet voice just drips and melts around these soft warm notes. an irresistable and soul soothing audio treat.
B009GEEMLY|3|There isn't a lot of depth here, but the movie is OK if you are just looking for some entertainment.
B00E8S2KV2|5|The additional scenes in the movie are great, but the 3 discs of special features are utterly fantastic. This is a necessary addition to the collection of any fan of Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth.
B00AECDDYY|4|The range of 5 difficulty levels makes this fun whether I'm looking for a challenge or just a brief diversion
B00080ZG10|4|Well done.  Nearly true to life.  A must see for plane devotees
B004S699K4|5|Very decent sequel to the Halloween movies, Jamie Lee Curtis returns, I highly recommend it!
B000002KZ6|5|The only song on this CD I could honestly say I don't like is I Get Wild. Every other song is really very enjoyable... some greatly so; my favorites are Making Flippy Floppy and Pulling Up The Roots, but I actually found out about the CD through This Must Be The Place. This album truly is a work of art, and a good first buy for those new to the band. (I should know; it was my first!)
0553801473|5|am glad that martin has finally stuck with his deadline and am enjoying this book a lot. i hope that he is able to set a faster pace for the next books.
0060594888|5|Great book !<br />Did not stop reading until I was done.  Was a great way to show you how to start from the beginning to become a success.  If we all applied just half of these principles our lives would be better.
B008Y7N7JW|1|On the top right corner it says \\"You own this video<br />HD movie playback is currently limited to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Roku or other Amazon Instant Video HD compatible devices.\\"<br /><br />I'm on a pc. My monitor is 1080p, my graphics card supports HD, my comp can do either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. I can watch other movies and shows on Amazon in HD but not this one? Also the promotion page says I have the option to download this video to a pc also yet I can't find a download link!
B00973902K|5|I have no idea if this song will be remembered in twenty years, but it is a great summer song for now.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B004TI5N38|5|Great Baldacci.  Lots if detail.  A bit different if you like mysteries.  Yes you will want to read the second book.
B00ERIUO02|5|Katy is back! I love every song on this album! Favorites are Legendary Lovers, Unconditionally, Roar, Choose Your Battles, Walking on Air, & This Is How We Do.
B00A9ET4MC|5|one of the best books I've read in a while.  So much packed into it, from this great young African writer.  Far from just a discussion on race, it's really a love story, spanning 3 continents, as she looks at life, love, loneliness, people!
B00FVVR2ZO|4|I'm so happy the Kindle update dropped!
B00C5R7F8G|4|Tedious in parts.
1401207529|5|If you are a fan of Batman and graphic novels, there is no reason not to read Year One. It is one of the best!
B009POHHR6|1|This will not download. It is stupid, and I can't even return it for money...It is stupid process that should be able to return.
B00005LQ04|2|when it's all said and done, I felt like I COULD'VE done something else.  It's the kind of movie that I don't regret watching, but really have a small need to see very often, but may want to in about 10 years.  The first attack was the best.  The rest of them were noticeable to kinda silly.  It has a good use of sound, color, and atmosphere, and recommended for viewing, but not more than the initial time, which took 3 viewings before I was able to reach the end.  Worthy of credit, but a high level of acclaim is not what I would bestow to this title.  Maybe I just saw it too late in my life(2001 vs. early 80s).
B0045HCJ94|5|This product was rated five stars for its quick arrival time.  I'd recommend this service for anyone looking for a classic.
B009GESJH2|5|I loved this cd from the very first listening and think every track is radio friendly enough to make it as a top forty hit! I am a big Bob Seger fan another Michigan alum and this cd has Kid Rock channeling Seger! It sounds like the best of Bob Segers stuff from the the mid 70's to the early 80's!
B006OCM0G0|4|Good game but need to be quick
B009A3NGF4|4|I mostly like Mumford and Sons for their rockin' banjo songs.  Babel has several really rockin' banjo songs but it's plagued by a good number of slow songs as well.  Overall this is a good album, and even their slow songs are quite enjoyable.
B00004T1HK|3|I really like Britneys first CD, so as soon as I heard about the second, I rushed out and bought it. I was expecting similar music to before but her style and her voice have changed so much. I prefere her voice to before but  the style has got worse. Especially songs like Stronger, you can really  hear the synthisizer twisting and distorting her voice. Fortunatly, Britney  has started to co-write some music which I think will make a difference  when she gets better at doing it. Here is my quick review of the  CD<br />1)Oops!...I did it Again: Good song, similar to baby one more time,  her voice sounds more mature though. The talking in the middle is  corny(very)<br />2)Stronger: Again not a bad song, but the synthisizer wreaks  some of it. The lyric &quot;My loneliness ain't killing me no more&quot;,  the opersite to baby one more time.<br />3)Don't go knocking on my Door: Not  the most inspiring of tunes. the introduction to the next song is bung on  the end of this track(strange! )<br />4)Can't get no Satisfaction: Classic  makeover. I its a touchy subject but I think she did it pretty  well.<br />5)Don't let me be the last to know: This song reminds me of ABBA  despite the slightly oriental opening chord sequence. Good song.<br />6)What U  see is what U get: Cool song. Its powerfull, full and suits her voice.  Can't really fault it.<br />7)Lucky: Cheesy introduction. A bit pointless song  but its definatly a song about Britney herself. I do like the extra voices  in the middle.<br />8)One Kiss from You: Good song, some nice harmonies and  chord sequences. The ending is unconvincing<br />9)Where Are you Now: My  favorite song at the moment. A soothing, mellow tune which has been  brilliantly writen. Can't fault it.<br />10)Can't make You Love Me: Sounds too  much like Oops!... Still, its not a bad song. Most people will be able to  identiy with the lyric at some point.<br />11)When Your Eyes say it: The first  half minute is all talking! I didn't buy this CD to listen to Britney  talking.<br />12)Girl in the Mirror: She must have done a lot of work on her  voice. There are some really strong vocal passages it this. Good base line  to this too.<br />13)Dear Diary: The only song Britney had a part in writing.  Not bad for a first attempt. Completely original subject(not). The shortest  track on the CD.
B000E5N6LG|4|good old fashion  cowboy , western movies. I happen to like Mr. Cosner. So it was nice to catch his earliest  roles.
B005ERYEGU|5|I run an insurance agency and we are adopting SFDC this summer. This book has given me a roadmap full of ideas to transition my office into a more productive model using this awesome cloud technology.
0763644765|5|This book is simply adorable.  I read some of the negative reviews and feel like they are unfair.  The book is written for very small children so the fact that it doesn't have full length sentences seems right.  The main thing it teaches is to stay on the potty & keep trying until baby is successful. I thought it was very cute & well written for the age group it is intended for.
B00GB90O8M|5|I bought this CD for my son for Christmas.  He truly LOVES this CD (and so do I)!  Lindsey Stirling is a versatile and talented artist!
0425267695|4|Anthony has devised a great story, which kept begging for more. I started the next book in the series the same day I finished Blood Song.
B00003CXXI|5|Believe it or not but this is a movie everyone will love.  It's got some slight innuendos only adults might catch and funny moment kids will love.  I highly recommend this video in everyone's collection.
B0064TVQ5E|3|I'm not really into the game.  I'll keep trying it.  Not the products' fault...just mine!  I'm sure playing it is real good for keeping my mind alert!
B002PEP4U0|3|Took a while to get into it and some parts would be more interesting to  people handy with making things and tools; but I still was amazed at what  the boy in the story could accomplish.  All basically on his own.
B0063IH60K|5|Fun to play and it's free!
B008BU75IQ|4|Love Jeffrey Archer's writings however I only gave it 4 stars because it was a cliff-hangar.  All the Clinton Chronicles leave you hanging until you get the next book in the series.  I prefer a start, middle and an end.  Having said that, I liked the story line and the characters.
0307352153|5|I think that everyone should read this book. It is extremely well written, and even though it is nonfiction it is still keeps your interest and is hard to put down. I found it fascinating. Even if you are not an introvert yourself someone you know is, be it a spouse, child, friend, etc. This book will help extroverts have a better understanding of introverted individuals and perhaps help people not view introverted people as damaged in some way. As an introvert myself I found this book incredibly validating. It helps to know that just because you have no wish to be life of the party or because you enjoy staying home and reading a book over going out and socializing that that doesn't mean there is something wrong with you or you are a bad person. Once again, I cannot recommend enough that everyone read this book. I plan on rereading it myself.
0808592777|1|all i can say is see for yourself, go to barns and nobles, read it, then tell me how much you loved it!  i regret even touching the book.
B000023VR6|1|When I first listened to this CD, it was alright. But when I started  overplaying Still D.R.E., I was getting sick of it. I don't like the songs  &quot;What's The Difference?&quot;, &quot;B_ _ch N_ _gaz&quot;,   &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;, and &quot;F_ _ _ You.&quot; The only good  song on this album is the one Dre dedicates to his brother. Bottom line is  though this CD is not worth buying. If you want to buy good Dr. Dre albums,  buy The Chronic and N_ _gaz 4 Life.
B008XX6J4C|5|I have enjoyed every video by The Piano Guys and pre-ordered the CD because I couldn't wait to hear it.  It has lived up to my expectations.  Lately, except for Christmas music, it's all I've been listening to.  It's soothing and beautiful to work to, relax to, clean to ... it's good for every occasion. If you like cello and piano, it's a must have CD. I'd like to buy one for everyone I know!
B00E9ZATVW|5|My son will love it once he sees that we bought him the Cars movie. He is a very big fan and cant stop watching it all day long. So going to be excited once he sees the Cars movie.
B00004TS0E|4|We watched this movie with the kids the other night and I was reminded how much I like it. It's a great feel-good movie for the holidays. I wouldn't recommend it for the kids though - it's too long and Santa really doesn't have his suit on for much of it. But if you have not seen this movie, it is worth a watch this holiday season.
B00FAPF5U0|5|🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭
B00005B36H|4|Tool. Words cannot describe the depth and power of your music. It is an art form with no compare.  Lateralus is your newest masterpiece. From the wonderful combination of Parabol/Parabola , to the anger ridden Ticks &amp; Leeches, Maynard can scream out his sometimes haunting, always moving, never dissapointing lyrics. A must buy for any fan of music.
B003Z71OO6|5|Excellent movie!!!
B0001FTVDQ|5|Wow!  These things blew me away!  It is like being brought to a whole new world of audio.  Bass is deep, accurate, controlled, and equal to that of $2000 offerings.  Same in the treble and midrange.  For those who have not seen a graph of the headphone's frequency response, it is pretty much dead center, and puts companies such as Grado and Bose to shame.  However, you must have a mp3 player with good amplification (sorry, Apple iPods degrade the audio) and/or a headphone amp.  I thought Grado was THE right choice, which actually has over-emphasized treble that tries to bring back detail lost elsewhere in the sound spectrum.  When I plugged in HD555, I noticed what the Grado actually did to compensate for its shortcomings, a technique Bose uses as well.  The Sennheiser bloomed with balance, rich, sweet cymbal crashes, life-like roars of the electric guitar, and full, articulation of the vocals.  This sound quality transfers to any genre of music, too, actually.  Provided the recordings are mastered properly, even heavy rock should sound correct.  Other reviews scolded the HD555 for its lack of bass.  This is a result of dynamic range loss that some recording studios due to increase volume.  On a 24-bit audio recording, Sennheiser also soars more than any other major competitors.  The others sound over-emphasized.  Get the HD555 and love it.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love this app. It is a great tool at home and for following along readings at church and studying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|What might normally be considered a &#34;chick flick&#34; type of series is definitely suitable for everybody. I've been able to convert quite a few men into Downton Abbey followers. ~smiles~ Love the storylines and the cast.
B005NJU8PA|5|And tell Barnes and Noble to join the rest of the world in the 21st century. Have both the e book for my phone and hard copy to display on my book shelf.
B000FCK65W|5|Can't believe I've waited over 40 years to read this - but was it ever worth the wait! If you love a tale beautifully told then you just can't pass this up.
B00004T8RK|4|Pearl Jam's every new album is something to explore. This album is something different from their previous works yet strong and powerful.<BR>Best tracks: Breakerfall, Slight Of Hand, Light Years, Soon Forget.
B000I5X81K|5|This CD is awesome! I have listened to it over and over and over since it arrived! I highly recommend buying the CD Josh Groban has an amazing voice!
B006T5C5PS|4|This book made me opptomistic toward the ability to live a cancer-free live and that cancer is curable. The Gerson therapy that this book promotes, which focuses mainly in detoxification and nutrition, makes sense in restoring the body immune system that is responsible to maintain a healthy body. The juicing practice and enema coffee are two main courses of the Gerson therapy. The book not only a must for patients with cancer but for all those who want to maintain a healthy body.
B00770KR7W|5|I got this figure along with the other series, note, I'm a huge halo collector and I don't open most of my figures. But I can still manage to see the detail on it.<br />That being said. I bought the figure and after looking at it for a few hours, it went up on my shelf. A few days pass, I'm on the internet searching for halo news, and 343i had just released a vidoc about the master chief, so of course I watch it. In the video they talk about the chiefs armor detail, now in the official video game trilogy. Master Chiefs Spartan number is not anywhere on his armor, but in the extended universe he has a huge 117 painted on his chest plate. To my surprise in Halo 4 they gave him 117 on his chest, but in braile... So I think to myself, I wonder if the figure has this new detail too. And what do you know, it did!! I went crazy, that alone made me like the figure so much more.
B009MCRHH6|5|This game is super entertaining. Showed it to my husband and he couldn't stop playing it either. I got stuck in a few levels but not unsolvable...that's what makes it so addicting.
B00D48BT5A|2|Interesting in the beginning and  then it starts to drag on and on and on and on .......
B0054JZC6E|5|fun and addictive will recommend to friends. love love love love this game. I play it constantly. love the game. a lot.
B00J8CGU64|3|It was very slow with lots of meaningless conversations at the beginning, but towards the end it started to get better. I gave 3 stars just because Leonardo did a great job :)
B0001UL7RY|5|I wasn't sure if it could get too much better, but it did!  Her follow up CD to Let Go was even better than her debut..which I loved also.  If you like any of Avril's songs, you'll love this album! <br /> <br />Take Me Away (9/10)  A great song, she sounds great and its fun to drum along to (pretend..as I have no drumset..lol)  It's a good one. \\"My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you..\\" <br /> <br />Together (10/10)  Together is an awesome song, I love to sing along with it.  And she sounds great as usual. \\"Together it doesn't feel right at all, together we've built a wall, together holding hands, we'll fall\\" <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me (10/10)  Her catchy single, very girl-power (not in a Spice Girls Way..)  It has a good message.  Love it. \\"Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who gives it all away\\" <br /> <br />He Wasn't (8/10)  An upbeat, fun song.  I like this fast chorus..It's a cool song. \\"this is when I start to bite my nails, and clean my room when all else fails\\" <br /> <br />How Does It Feel (9/10)  This is a pretty, slower song.  She sounds awesome on it.  Good one! :)\\"How does it feel to be different from me, are we the same?\\" <br /> <br />My Happy Ending (10/10) My favorite song on the Album..so impossible not to sing along with..I LOVE it!  And it's a very Avril song..great! \\"You were everything that I wanted, we were meant to be, supposed to be..but we lost it\\" <br /> <br />Nobody's Home (8/10)  Not a bad song, but not my favorite.  I think there are songs that should have been a single before this one, but its kind of deeper. \\"She wants to go home, but nobody's home..thats where she lies, broken inside\\" <br /> <br />Forgotten (7/10)  This song is alright, I don't like the tune of the chorus..it seems like they just didn't get it right so they settled.  I like some parts of this song a lot though. \\"have you forgotten, everything that wanted?\\" <br /> <br />Who Knows (9/10) Once again, great and catchy.  \\"Who Knows what could happen do what you do, just keep on laughing.  One things true, theres always a brand new day.  I'm gonna live today like its my last day\\"  Cool lyrics <br /> <br />Fall To Pieces (10/10)  Another kinda pretty song, I like it a lot.  It's one of my favorites.  \\"And I don't wanna fall to pieces, I just wanna sit and stare at you\\"  Good song! <br /> <br />Freak Out (10/10) Definitely one of my favorites on this CD...LOVE IT!  And its such a me song, so its great.  \\"I'm gonna close my eyes, I can't watch the time go by, I won't keep it inside, Freak Out leg it go!\\" <br /> <br />Slipped Away (7/10) Sad song about losing a loved one \\"I didn't get around to kiss you, goodbye on the hand\\" <br /> <br />
B004SIP6C2|5|Great acting in a remarkable story.
B0000DD7NL|5|Don't get me wrong, I like Songs In A Minor but I really LOVE this one. Alicia has truly matured over the past two years and she has a lot more variety on here. She truly sings from her heart and soul and is very genuine about what she does. Not to mention she is the FIRE ON THOSE KEYS! MAN! I have never seen someone play like her since Roberta Flack! <BR>There are not many real artists out there like her and she is one that exemplifies what a REAL artist should be. Also, I have never seen someone take some classical music and modernize it and make it so enjoyable. I now LOVE some Beethoven and Chopin! I also love the way she takes old school tunes and put her own touch to it. She's not like any of these other artists who try and put some recycled beats to an old school tune no less try and SING them. PURE GENIOUS! Her production team is AWESOME. Alicia Keys is one artist that is here to stay forever and a day!<BR>HATERS... I suggest you keep on making noise because the more noise you make. THE MORE SHE WILL BE BLESSED AND THE MORE GRAMMIES SHE IS GONNA GET!
B005LAIH4A|5|We (the whole family) enjoyed it in the theater and now get to watch when ever we like.  The boys watched it over and over for the first few days.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|A well casted movie, a fine nemesis played by the superb Benedict Cumberbatch. Enjoy the ride!
B00H58VGIA|4|All of her books are great. Wonderful insight and characters. I would definitely recommend this book to others, loved it.
B00MIA0L9U|5|Not a big foo fighters fan, but loved the HBO series and bought the CD.  It ended up making my top 10 CDs list for the year.
B00EEN66SY|2|The movie filled some time for us but we are older seniors.  Disturbing though that this was taken from real life.  Hard to believe these things happen.
B003JTHXOK|5|Loved it! Could 'nt put it down! Great read! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out!<br />Michelle M
B00BSB2AE4|5|There were moments that I'm sure those around me thought that I was losing my mind due to my uncontrolled laughter while reading this book. She gives a very honest version of the thoughts that run through her mind.
B0009P5YXO|5|Who cares that it's also a pen. I HAVE A SONIC SCREWDRIVER:) It lights up and has two different sounds, it plays a different one depending on what level the end/head (the light up part) is. I love it!
B00BHMETKC|4|Great movie and I am glad the wife and I got to watch it before the academy awards show came out.
B00RY85CQI|5|Great story. He's the father of modern computing.
B00005U2JL|5|I bought this for a gift of a fan and they loved it. Said they watched it 5 times in a row as soon as getting it. That is a real fan. Not my cup of tea though. Item as described, fast shipping. would buy from again.
B003LQ3YXU|5|Although there were a lot of times I felt this show was just Goosebumps for adults it still has some good story lines and a really good Doctor.
B000LW7OWE|5|Had this Movie as a DVD. Had to buy the Blu Ray...I think Val Kilmer was Perfect for this Role and despite the some of the negative reviews about the Oliver Stone Version of his life and how he tend to Docu-drama his movies into hi own personal vision... I think Not. ! Fact is almost of the stuff portrayed in the movie is in fact true and happened virtually the way it was portrayed in the movie...  And I think if anything J.M. was given somewhat of a pass in terms of his REAL &#34;dark side&#34; which he was shown as somewhat of a pied piper type figure... The Singing was Great by Kilmer and uncanney in realizism... as well as the Signing of him to the role as well the whole production and package... Well done ! Brings me back to the 70's and that craziness...
B0051MKMNC|5|Great movie. Very well done
B00CLD65X0|5|I love all the characters
B000UFAURI|5|The Foo Fighters have always been at the very top of the alternative rock scene as one of the most inovative. Thanks to now legenday Dave Grohl, this band has been filling our ears with powerful rock songs for over a decade. With their sixth studio release the Foo Fighters have reached new level. The twelve tracks have a sound at least I haven't heard from this band. They have more of a haunting feeling that leaves you in chills once the album is over. The music ranges from loud electric to very meloncholly acoustic. This is also the first time I have heard Dave Grohl scream alot since their grammy winning 'Colour & Shape.' This is truly a remarkable cd and it is definitely going to get alot of credit maybe even a grammy nomination. This cd pretty much lands Foo Fighters as a staple band in the history of music from the late 90s and with each new release it brings them closer and closer to the rock & roll hall of fame.
B00BD99JMW|2|WIsh I never read this last book. Ruined the series for me. I expected so much more and it did not have to end the way it did. The whole story line was a jumbled up mess.
B00JCW0BCY|5|Eye-opening and inspiring. Will make me a better physician
B00HSCDX70|2|Too many repeat tracks.  And the music is VERY &#34;outside.&#34;  A little too cacaphonic for my taste.
B008Y7N7JW|4|Jennifer Lawrence carried the film. Woody Harelson was a breath of fresh air. This is a great start to this series & looking forward to the next film.
B006PHD0RW|4|Passable as a kill time puzzle :)
6305609721|5|Leonard Nimoy lent his genious talent in directing this truly epic and succesful film in the Star Trek movie series and a favorite period among the fans of the almost 35 year old franchise and even among the people who  saw it that weren't fans love it , it is as much everything that Star Trek  it self is making you laugh while at the same time being emotional and  serious and the one thing that is most famous about Star Trek old friends ,  that we know so well back together for another big<br />journey and this on is  no acception as it proves to be there most challenging of this gallant  crew.<br />  The federation is in complete chaos as a sudden unanswerable  probe that they seemingly can't stop or answer is threatning the entire  world and draining it dry , the answer lies with the crew to try and find a  solution to answer this probe.They find the answer in the probes language  they figure out that the probe can be answerd by the sounds of Humpback  whales but in there time period the whales have been extinct for a very  long time ,  Spock suggest that the answer would be to travel  into the  past to 20th century and attemt to find Humback whales but when they do the  surrounding prove to be even more challenging to them then  mission itself  as they confront punk rockers  bus fare and exact change and pizza they  seemingly confront these things in a way that Leonard Nimoy does that makes  you laugh because they never know whats going to happen in this time and  there reactions are so rediculous that you wanna crack up.<br />   The answer  lies in finding these whales with a  fiery female marine biologist who  cares for the whales very deeply and distrusts the Admiral but when she  discovers that the whales have been shipped out to take there chances on  there own she askes for the Admirals help in getting the whales to a safe  place so they will never be in danger but there journey of finding them and  getting them back safely will prove to be far more difficult than they  could ever imagined.<br />    For any Star Trek fan this is the coolest Star  Trek DVD it shows you a feturette in the making of this truly incredible  masterpeice its a must have for any Star Trek fan and an incredible  legendary Star Trek film.
B00992CF6W|3|It's not at all like the pc version, but it's still Minecraft. I like it.
B0028MBKVG|4|Having already read Ultramarathon Man (by Dean K), and being recommended this book I thought.. more of the same.<br />While it is similar, it's not the same, there's a good story in it, and a little preaching about running shoes being evil,etc.<br />Inspirational.<br />Makes me want to run more.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This game is so awesome. If you like challenges this is the game for you! There are many Easter eggs to be<br />Explored and lots of funny moments when your friend screams because he/she forgot to wind the music box. I think everyone should get this game. And hope for a THIRD one!
B00D23GXB2|5|“Revenge of the Orgasms” includes some very powerful poems that are sure to get you in the mood. If you’re not in a relationship with anyone I strongly suggest you read this book with caution because it will sure put you in the mood for some sexual healing. The author, G.P.A. touches on just about every topic (marriage, infidelity, racism, family issues, forbidden and complicated desires, hurtful experiences, grief, love, etc.) and takes you on a thought- provoking journey from the beginning when you first open the book until the every end. If you like poetry and love the erotic selections, this book aims to please with great foreplay.
B000005HLV|5|This album is probably the best Black metal album out there. In the same league (in terms of excellence) as In the Nightside Eclipse, this is simply brilliant. Euronymous' guitar playing skill and song craftmanship comes out in full here for all to see. Hellhammer's breathtaking drumming is a delight - not simply pounding out the same beat ad infinitum - but shifts in pitch, tempo. You name it, Hellhammer can execute it. The glorious rumble of Varg's bass guitar (although way down in the mix, per Euronymous' parents request after the the Count butchered their son) are still evident (one can only imagine what the original must have sounded like!).<br />But above all, Atilla's glorious operatic style takes the album to an entirely different dimension. This style not only complements the music played, but adds an evil theatrical dimension, which contrary to what some people have opined here, makes the album 100 times better, rather than worse.<br />You have to buy this album. Sound quality is pretty good (especially when you compare it to some of Darkthrone's releases) Worth it just for the song Da Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. This album is way underpriced for what you are getting!!!!
B006R4H5FG|1|Very poor tips. Lot of pages of nothing. Very dissapointing book for me. I was expecting more practical information on it.

B0000025H6|5|When this album was recorded and released, Pink Floyd were on top of the world having achieved all the success they wanted to achieve.  But sometimes success has a price tag.  The price tag is the \\"wall\\" which sometimes separates yourself from the rest of society.  American society in particular worships success and material gain at the cost of one's physical and mental health.  It also creates a kind of competition and even hostility between you and the rest of the world.  That's what Dark Side Of The Moon looked at.  The Wall gets more specific and tells the story of the pressures of being a rock n' roll star.  Most if not all rock musicians strive for fortune and fame and hanging out with all the groupies.  But sometimes that lifestyle leaves you with all your personal demons and those demons can drive you insane.  Those demons may be your own responsibility or those created by family or business issues.  The album begins with \\"In The Flesh?\\" and the character portrayed is a famous rock n' roll musician getting ready to go on stage.  But he is suddenly confronted by all his demons such as his father getting sent off to a foreign land to go to war.  This segues into \\"The Thin Ice\\".  His wife comforts his newborn son telling the baby that his grandfather will be OK.  The first brick in the wall is the separation he feels as his father is being sent off to war.  The next brick is that of abuse at school by both classmates and teacher when he was a young boy.  This type of treatment leads him ultimately to rebel against the educational system.  He asks in \\"Mother\\" if he should cut himself off from all the people supposedly responsible for his tribulations.  \\"Mother, should I build the wall?\\"  In other words, he is asking if he should ever associate with these people again.  In \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" the horrifying pictures of his father fighting and getting killed in the war are brought to his attention again.   He then looks for something to fill in the \\"Empty Spaces\\".He tries having sex with all the groupies in \\"Young Lust\\" in order to numb his pain.  He avoids all communication with the groupie back at the hotel by watching war movies on television in \\"One Of My Turns\\".  Finally all the violence he sees on the television brings back to memory the death of his own father and he goes insane and starts tearing up the room.  He is so beside himself that he hurls the television out of his hotel room window onto the street below.  He feels remorseful of his behavior and pleads with his mate, \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\".  Finally everything that drove him to his current state of mind comes back to haunt him.  This is the third brick.  He is so angry and upset that he avoids all physical contact with people in \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\".  This closes the first half.  The second half opens with him working hard to overcome his demons in \\"Hey You\\".  He asks \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" who can help him.  He returns to watching television and tries calling his wife on the phone in \\"Nobody Home\\".  No one responds.  He asks if there is anybody out there who can feel the pain he is feeling.  He remembers somebody named Vera Lynn.  He cries out against the apparent injustice of war and demands to \\"bring the boys back home\\".  He then turns to drugs in \\"Comfortably Numb\\".  He is given an anesthetic by the doctor to calm him down.  He arrives at the show and is ready to perform no matter how severe his hardships.  At the show, he weeds out the people he dislikes the most from the audience.  He becomes kind of a dictator to his audience.  The people who are in his favor give him a \\"Hail Hitler\\" kind of salute.  After the show, he takes to the streets to weed out the \\"weaklings, the queens, the coons, the reds, and the Jews\\" of the city.  These people to him are nothing but worms in his sight and must be wiped off the face of the earth.  Finally, he is tried in a court of law for all the atrocities he has committed.  He  tells the judge that insanity was the reason for his crimes.  He is then sentenced to be \\"exposed before his peers\\".  The crowd in the courtroom then chants to \\"tear down the wall\\" meaning they are glad he is getting his just deserts. The wall is finally torn down and the city tries to rebuild itself.  This album applies not only to rock stars but also to anybody at the top of their profession who feels constant pressure to succeed and wants to lash out at the world in the midst of this stiff competition.  Such people may turn to drugs, sex, or crime for their escape.  Such themes is what makes The Wall such a powerful masterpiece.
B000XUBFE2|5|The death angel has never been so unique, nor ever had a chance to narrate a story, as far as I know. I was sceptical at first by Zusak pulled it off and it was a wonderful read. Also unique to me--hearing and seeing WW2 from inside Germany. Since they were &#34;the bad guys&#34; it's hard to imagine what this book gives us--a real and passionate story of ordinary people trying to survive a terrible war they neither asked for nor believed in.
B000QRIGLC|5|I'm not going to repeat what every other review has said. I will just say that I completely agree with the positive ones.
B00BFV1M0U|3|I liked this book, gave the reader more answers to the questions posed in The Maze Runner. Some interesting new characters introduced.
B001NVIZ9I|5|Typical 30's love story adventure film.  Replete with damsel in distress, swashbuckling hero to the rescue and happily ever after ending.
B008FRFN7A|5|Amazing!! I can print from my iPhone and kindle!
B007IXWKUK|5|This book as well as fifty shades of gray deserve 5 stars!!! they are a must read. They will leave you wanting more!!
B003O86FMW|4|This book depicts a strange, new World of the future where government controls everything.  It is not a happy story to read, but one that is thought provoking.  Although the book was written for late teenagers, it is just as good for adults.
B008EQIEWS|5|Very enjoyable movie with lots of actions and good story line. Watched the movie  with my grandkids who remembered the first movie \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and made the link to \\"Wrath of the Titans.\\"
B0026IQFS0|1|Now look: I am an avid reader. I enjoy from a light airy read to a dense thought-provoking novel. Words are no strangers to me. But the words Patrick O'Brian uses on his celebrated novels read like a notaries' account of a naval court-martial. There really should be an annotated version of this book so people eager to get into the series can be eased into the terminology. A previous reviewer suggested \\"skipping over\\" the dense nautical jargon, sound advice for some but I can't read in this fashion. I really wanted to love these books but I had to pause so many times to go look on the internet what the hell the man was writing about I gave up on the first 100 pages or so. Kudos to those that are into them (I envy you guys) but be warned: Mr. O'Brian uses a LOT of dense nautical terms to describe what's going on so disorientation sets in and doesn't leave (at least the first 100 pager or so, wouldn't know about afterwards). It's like trying to watch a french film with no subtitles, some non-french-speaking people may enjoy it but I'd rather understand what's going on.

0671646788|5|This books needs to become Text book. It is wonderful book.<br />Using the techniques given in the book is surest way to success.
0156027321|4|This is a well-written book that effectively uses humor and metaphors. I rated this with 4 stars only because it was well written and people who enjoy reading gory details might appreciate reading this.  <br /> <br />I read this book as a reading assignment for our book club.  I do not recommend this book to other women like myself since it contained gruesome, graphic details on animals getting ripped to shreds.  Since I love animals--all kinds--I found this difficult to read, but I still read the entire book in time for our book club discussion.   <br /> <br />However, I liked the character Pi and enjoyed the author's sense of humor.  I had to find out how Pi was rescued. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5|I rented this movie just for fun.  I didnt know anything about it beforehand either.  I absolutely  loved it.  Laughed so hard I nearly cried a few times.  Mostly because I can remember kids just like Napoleon in school and he played the part so perfectly.  This movie is better with a group of people however.  Laughter is contagious.  Since I rented it, My hubby got it for me for Christmas and I have been asked by everyone I work with to borrow it and most everybody thinks it's stupid, but funny.  Good way to describe it.  Stupid, but funny.  I hope they make a Napoleon Part 2.  Lucky.
B003G4W49C|1|bad writing.  poor development of characters. not inspirering for young adults. too much good young adult literature out there to waste time on this series.
B00FR88VTC|1|Never worked
B007SYWFRM|3|The pros in the game are pretty awesome: you can level up easily by buying fun structures where you can collect money every 30 secs; there's a Scrat mini game within the take where you can win pretty amazing animals that you normally have to purchase with acorns and c'mon who doesn't love the pack and wishes they could be a part of it?<br /><br />Now the cons. Lately, I've been. having problems opening up the game. I'm not talking abut FC and having too much memory crammed in my kindle fire. Noooo, I'm talking abut simply being able to open it and playing. I don't want to start over since I've been playing it obsessively for weeks now. I would rather explore other games than do that insanity. So please, fix your game before you start losing players in droves!
B001DM1VXE|5|Can that somehow works in this very moving story.  Some may be disappointed in the ending, but the journey is well worth your time.
B009UX2YAC|4|This is a great game for all ages. My son started playing it when he was two yet it is fun enough to keep me entertained.
B000002UJQ|5|the most brilliant album yet!...even better than &quot;the bends&quot;(there second album)OK computer is a masterwork woven by guitars,drums and the stunningly great voice of Thom Yorke. the only thing better then it is hearing it live..it blows my mind away.     END
B005HS00V4|5|Several weeks ago I purchased Gabriel's dual disc which I gave a 5.0 rating (Oct. 29, 2011).  Buying this concert version of the music was a no brainer especially in Blu ray with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment.  I wasn't disappointed.  The concert is long at 162 minutes so there is no cheat on that score.  That's more than double the time on the CD and adds about 7 songs.<br /><br />Gabriel is no slouch on audio and video tricks and often adds some of his own sound effects to the songs.  He also plays around with one of those small cameras that hang from the ceiling.  This goes on too long and too often for my taste.  While in full voice Peter Gabriel is still a strong vibrant singer but in the brief interludes between songs he talks in a near whisper even while the audience is still clapping.  This makes some of the introductions incomprehensible.<br /><br />I can't speak highly enough of the fine \\"New Blood\\" orchestra assembled for this project.  Led by young conductor Ben Foster, they are brilliant.  There are no guitars and no drum kits, but there are 50 or so top notch musicians and are masterfully synched to play the great arrangements by John Metcalfe.  Gabriel has vocal backing by his daughter Melanie who has a few solos within the songs and Ane Brun whose voice sounds a bit frail on her one feature (\\"Don't Give Up\\").  Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan shows up for one song (\\"In Your Eyes\\") as well.<br /><br />The direction that appears on the Blu ray is well done by Blue Leach.  The cameras are well located giving different angles of the singers and the conductor.  Still, it's all about the sound.  The surround versions put you about 15 rows deep in the center.  This is not the Peter Gabriel remembered from the 1980's.  He's more mature and like all artists wants to expand his musical horizons.  He does it here with a bit of new material, a few carefully selected covers and a new approach to his hits.  He doesn't miss.  An excellent concert well worth the money.<br /><br />UPON FURTHER REVIEW:  This was a brilliant stepping stone for Gabriel who seems to satisfy everyone including himself by reinventing the great songs that everyone loves.  Make no mistake, while some of his newer stuff is terrific, the biggies come late in the show (2 ½ hours!) and bring the house down.  Sonically the concert is well presented.  (4-27-12)<br /><br />I can't add much to the above other than to reinforce my appreciation for the technical side of the performance.  Perhaps my recent equipment upgrades help, but the audio is as good as any I've heard.  There are several double bass instruments and some bass drums, a French Horn and a quartet of trombones, so the subwoofers will shake.  Fine direction and an excellent orchestra more than make up for Gabriel's silliness with the hanging camera.  In one instance, he nearly decapitates the conductor.

B0000029LG|5|I read the critical review by Steven Mirkin regarding MJ's History release and couldn't DISAGREE with him more.  I'm a huge fan of MJ's earlier work but was completely blown away by the depth of History.  It rightly depicts how MJ has matured as a brilliant artist.  The array of his music is stunning.  Take time to listen to the layers upon layers of musical sounds he incorporates into each song.  He shrewdly employs gospel, rap, historical spoken recordings, street sounds, plain speech, electric sounds into absolutely amazing masterpieces - every single one of the \\"new\\" songs on this release fits into this category.  No other artist can move another person the way that MJ can.  He was a gift beyond measure to this planet.  What a loss that can never be replaced.

0670022411|5|There are a lot of paranormal vampire and/or  witch books but this is one of the better ones that I have read recently.

B006GWO5NE|5|I have lots of devices that charge via Micro USB. when I recently purchased and received a new Kindle Fire HD6, it of course came with the same type charger and cable. I was SO impressed with how it fit, that I couldn't let it be. It solved the problem I was having with my phone only wanting to charge with the cable and connector being held at certain angles. And every other device I tried it with worked well and fit more snug.<br /><br />I looked on Amazon and this is the listed replacement cable, so I ordered a couple. It must be the extra two metal &#34;prongs&#34; (for lack of a better word) that are located on the top of the connector.  I'm not sure, but to any who need a good one, this is the BEST fitting micro USB connector I've ever used.

B004LWZWBU|4|A quaint little movie with some big name stars, that teaches us to live life for the right reasons, and to simply enjoy the ride.  Yes there were some technical mistakes, even novice bird watchers or geography students would know are inaccurate, but who cares? They are very minor things.  Many good actors that have supporting roles here too.

B009NFHF0Q|5|Maybe I'm not qualified to make that statement because I have not read all of his works, especially the Sandman series, but in many ways, I think this is Neil's &#34;The Old Man and the Sea. Compared to American Gods and Anansi Boys, it is very short, 240 pages, or so, but it accomplishes a great deal in a short space.<br />It is told in first-person, a seven year old boy, and the reader never feels that the boy is speaking beyond his years. Yet the events in the story are well beyond his years. The story takes place in rural post-war England. The first chapter and into the second are fairly mundane and then, in the space of a sentence or two, the author kicks it up, sets the hook, and never lets the reader go. Masterful writing. Masterful storytelling. The two, often, do not go hand-in-hand. He takes elements other writers have written of, even Neil himself, and gives them a fresh telling, a more perceptive telling, and one that is satisfying without being sugary or happily-ever-after.<br />Maybe the book is not for everyone, but for anyone with a mystical bone in their bodies, even if it's the funny-bone, get it, read it, you will not be disappointed.
B005DD7H50|1|Awful! This movie was not able to retain my attention to follow the storyline. The first 30 minutes seemed so boring, made no sense- slow script- had to turn it off halfway. Can i get a refund?
1476727651|3|I knew Steve King as a kid. He lived next door to my Grandparents. When Carrie came out, I realized that this guy I'd known as a child was a published author. How cool, I thought, and have since purchased everything he's written, because he's good—damn good. His novels either grab you right off the bat or they don't. This one didn't. Don't get me wrong, in the end I was glad I read it and happy with the purchase, but as a writer myself, I thought that there was way too much character development and it was very slow moving until about page 300. This novel could have kicked ass at about 350 pages, but there were, in my opinion, way too many wasted words. Even though it's a sequel to The Shining, I think he wrote this for people who have never read it. All in all, a great read, but most of his novels keep me awake and unable to put them down. I read The Stand in 2 days. No food, no sleep. This one took me a week.

She is thought provoking and touched on questions that I had had for years. I never knew where to find even a conversation about them let alone hear the answer. I loved every minute of it. I did not want the book to end.
0439023483|5|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Review<br /><br />Rating: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Summary:<br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV<br /><br />Review:<br />The Hunger Games was brought up to me when I heard it from everyone around online and personally. I wanted to know what was so great about this 'Hunger' book, so when I arrived at Barnes & Noble, I remembered what to look for.<br />Boy, was I blown away.<br />The cashier looked at me as I gave her the book to ring up and she grinned. I didn't say anything, neither did she until she beeped the book and said \\"You're going to love this book! The third one comes out in August!\\"<br />I smiled and said \\"Thank you. I'm sure I will.\\" and went home to read. I read the first chapter with an O for a mouth and fingers assaulted by paper-cuts. I couldn't stop reading The Hunger Games. I know you won't either. 5 out of 5 Stars. This book is a must read for everyone through ages twelve and above. You'll be mighty hungry for The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />PROS: It is a page turner and will keep you intrigued throughout the whole entire book. The idea is genius, and the writing is incredible.<br /><br />CONS: Violence of teenagers killing one another. I do not think that it will make you close the book, though, no I do not, but that is the con. Truthfully, the book is one of the best I have ever read, though.<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD RENT/BUY/READ THIS BOOK : Survival and characterization joins together to form The Hunger Games. It is an intriguing novel with heart-pounding scenes. I will not lie to you and say it is four stars, no, this marvelous masterpiece deserves what I give it: FIVE STARS.
B00KG2OZIU|3|Interesting movie, unfortunately, it is not really historically accurate...there was no group of men called the Monuments group.  There were art historians et al seconded to different units in the military to help out as they went along. It couldo  have been better directed.

The build quality is pathetic, the sound quality is on par with a pair of iPhone earbuds and the constant static in the speakers and microphone make this product unusable.

B00003CX8I|5|Humanity is at a crossroads. Evolution has reared its head. There are human beings in the world today with extraordinary gifts and powers. These powerful beings are called \\"mutants.\\" And their existence scares some people.<br /><br />In the United States, Senator Robert Kelly has introduced legislation that will require all mutants to \\"register\\" as such. He feeds the fear by telling his peers, and the public, some of what he's heard these mutants can do.<br /><br />Two of the most powerful mutants, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X), and his old friend, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), have different agendas of how best to deal with humanity's intolerance of mutants.<br /><br />The Professor believes that patience is a virtue in this case. Humanity will come around eventually, he believes. In the meantime, he has established a \\"School for the Gifted,\\" where he teaches his students how to control and master their powers for the good of humanity.<br /><br />Magneto, on the other hand, believes that a war between humans and mutants is inevitable. Instead of waiting for it to happen, however, he wants to go on the offensive. If it's a war humans want, it's a war they will get. One way or the other, Magneto will see to it that the mutant race is the only race that survives.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know before going to see this movie, though you could really no nothing at all and not have to worry. \\"X-Men\\" does an excellent job of setting the stage for those viewers who no nothing of the world of mutants.<br /><br />The X-Men universe has been around for a very long time, with several incarnations in both the comic book and cartoon series world. Each incarnation has its own version of the struggle between humanity and mutants, as well as its own telling of the backgrounds of the characters. There is a very rich history to draw from, with a possible cast of hundreds of mutants to draw from.<br /><br />One of the reasons I liked this movie so much is that director Bryan Singer didn't try to introduce too many mutants all at once. Although long-time mutant lovers would have loved it, novice mutant viewers would have been too overwhelmed to follow the story. Instead, the main storyline was limited to just a handful of mutants (Professor X, Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Sabertooth, Toad, and Mystique). However, he also treated long time X-Men fans to a glimpse of many other mutant favorites (including Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, and Kitty to name a few).<br /><br />I also thought the casting of this movie was near perfection. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) made such a great Professor X that you almost begin to think that the comic book character was originally written with him in mind. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) as Magneto was also a great choice. Fanke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) were also very well choices.<br /><br />However, my favorite casting decision has got to be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I don't know who it was that saw the potential he had to play this part, but it was very much the right call. Of all the characters, the casting of Wolverine is the one that could have broken the entire movie for long time X-Men fans. Thankfully, Jackman was the perfect choice and we were treated to a great portrayal.<br /><br />I know some long time X-Men fans were disappointment that his or her favorite mutant did not make it into the movie. However, there is great potential for not only more X-Men movies (at the time of this review, X2: X-Men United has already been released and pre-production work is currently in progress for X-Men 3), but also for more specialized mutant movies focusing on one, two, or three mutants at a time (right now, rumors are circulating about a movie featuring Wolverine and one featuring Storm). If done correctly, this franchise can last for many, many years.<br /><br />The original VHS version alsocomes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards.<br /><br />Boiled down: \\"X-Men\\" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun. I truly recommend that you add this to your movie collection.ginal VHS version also comes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards. <br /> <br />Boiled down: \\"X-Men\\" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun.

0345803485|1|I bought this book out of curiosity, as it is a bestseller.  What is the attraction, I wondered.  Having read two-thirds of it (I could endure no more), I don't know why it sells so well.  It is one of the dumbest books of all time. Young woman meets kinky rich guy and their physical relationship is described in minute detail.  It is poorly written and boring.  Is the average person so stupid and so starved of intimacy that this book is a turn on?  I guess so. DUMB.  DUMB.  DUMB Book.
B005LF9OCE|5|How I Met Your Mother is one of the best tv shows ever! Season seven is full of unexpected twists and hilarious scenes.
B00FG1Q5J8|1|I had read about the bugs before downloading this game but I didn't think it would hinder me from even doing the first mission to mercury. When i go to navigate the game freezes. It may be because I'm running CM7.2 but if the beginning runs fine, why not the rest?
B00009P1O5|5|Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleeze are two of the characters and one of the songs on this, seriously rocking, album. Opera Star, Shots, Get Back on It, Southern Pacific, Motor City & Rapid Transit are all fine serious ROCK.  T-Bone has a little riff, but few lyrics to reccomend it.<br />Motor City has a line that may well require translation for today's younger listeners:  Datsun was the former name of the Nissan automobile company.  There may, or may not be too many Datsuns in this town any more....<br />Southern Pacific is a freight train of a song.  It carries a loud, heavy load and reflects upon the fact that these machines and their crew are disappearing.  <br />Get Back On It is another serious test of your stereo, and while it may be too late for General Custer & Robert E. Lee, it's not too late to buy this fine hard rock album from one of the masters of the field.  Think I'll get back on the highway<BR>I hope I'll see you soon....

0517548232|4|Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.
B00000K2UX|5|The cd arrived by the expected delivery date. I am very satisfied by the ordered item. The right cd's arrival made the high quality of customer service. The item played well. Also, the content is great.
B00GTCECVG|1|I USED to like this game (Castle Clash)…I was playing the game and attempted to use some jewels to speed up one of the tasks I was working on. Nothing seemed to be happening when I selected to use the jewels so I pressed it a few more times. I then happed to glance over at my jewel counter and noticed that the number looked lower than I remembered. I pressed the button one more time to be sure and lo-and-behold, more jewels disappeared, without effecting the process. I contacted customer service immediately letting them know what happened and I got a very short note saying we have looked into it. No error. That’s it. I have also noticed I will have mysteriously missing manna/gold/jewels when my game stops in mid pay due to something or other. Sometimes it says it’s because it lost internet connection for a nanosecond others I don’t have any rational explanation for.<br /><br />After days of waiting the only message I got was as follows:<br /><br />Dear player:<br /><br />Thank you for bringing this issue to us.<br /><br />We have looked into this issue and after our investigation, there is no record of any Gems being deducted from your game account abnormally on the reported day. Hence, there is no system error on this issue.<br /><br />We hope this may clarify your doubt on this issue.<br /><br />Thank you for your support and have a nice day.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br />Jiayan Wu (Rep ID 2423)<br />Castle Clash Team

B000067CPX|5|I love this! All the 16 songs are great! Listen to for example By the Way, Don't forget me, Can't stop, Midnight, Throw away your TV, Minor thing and Venice Queen. You Can't hate them. You are going to love them.
0375703764|4|This book will put you through 10 pages of pointless nothing (or maybe it is to set the mood) and then hit you with one page that will make you sleep with the lights on. I'm sure the other reviews have pointed out how unusual and sometimes anoying the writing style is, writing upside down and in mirror font and stuff.  It's all true, and the writer seemed to not really know where the heck the book was supposed to be going toward the end. But the basic storyline in this book is absolutely awsome, and the parts that are scary are probably the scariest I've ever read. Don't bother if you don't like wierd stuff though.
1932073221|5|This is a great book.  Works well with New Thought philosophies.  Helped me to re-examine how I look at finances and abundance.  Everyone should take the time to really assess how they use money.  My thought processes have kept me from being the financially abundant person I am meant to be.  What I have learned from this book has already \\"paid off\\" in big ways personally and professionally.
144235948X|5|. I loved, loved, and loved this book!!!! I downloaded the pre-view to pass some time hours before the \\"Reflected in You\\" book was released (which I pre ordered and was counting the days for the release). I was so intrigued in the preview I immediately bought the book. What started as a quick 10 p.m. read to pass the time before bed ended up keeping be up until I had to leave for work the next morning at 5:40 a.m.. The book left me mesmerized and unable to put it down. The characters had that Scarlett/ Rhett Butler complex to where the love/ hate relationship keep me begging for more. They were sexy with loads of drama to make them interesting. Many emotions were brought to surface during this read including sadness, excitement, happiness, tears, being scared, disgusted and so many more. This story kept it going with the perfect amounts of drama, love, sex, excitement and dialogue. The romance in the bedroom was lacking but it definitely wasn't over done as it is in some books. There were just enough details not to get old and embarrassed by reading. The scenes were also believable, due to every act of sex not ending in multiple organisms (like with Fifty Shades and Bared to You- common!!). These characters and the storyline were amazing! I cannot wait until his version, although I pre-viewed a chapter on the net and loved it! Jamie you are a great writer and should be very proud of yourself. As much as I like other books I found many gramatical errors and lines written making me wonder if they even had editors to preview before releasing. Hopefully you have a sequel to this series. Do they make it or not? Is she already pregnant, will he end up fighting in Vegas after all, does he suffer the after math of the deadly fire from the fight. How will it affect their love story? Or maybe carried out with Mare's or Shipley's story intertwined with many updates with this couple....I have my fingers closed

B009GX7IRA|5|I really enjoy this show, I bought all the seasons as I was watching via Amazon.  I am starting from the beginning yet again!<br />I am about to cancel my cable TV, who needs it when you have Amazon!
B007FEFLTO|5|Just like all Ken Follett's books, I couldn't put it down.  His research is wonderful, and I knew much of the history, but didn't really have a feel for the impact on the millions of people that lived through ww2.  Waiting for book three!
B00MB8P1OO|2|Streaming issues. Crashes often.
B006LSZECO|5|Excellent. A page turner. Amazing character development. Of course, the twists!!!! Very, very unexpected read. Highly recommend.
0399143904|1|Rainbow Six proves that Tom Clancy is just going through the motions and living off the reputation created by earlier works. If you're interested in Mr. Clark, WITHOUT REMORSE is a far better read. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER  is also a better told tale than Rainbow Six. The characters are shallow and  poorly developed, the plot is totally implausable, Clancy tends to run on  and on for pages when he should be concise and surgical in his writing, and  the ending ... well, let's just say it stretches credibility to the  breaking point. IMHO, Tom Clancy has reached the end of his run. I've read  several of his most recent collaborations, and the same problems occur in  each and every one. For my money, Tony Hillerman is a far better writer who  says more in two paragraphs than Tom Clancy says in 200 pages. After  reading Rainbow Six I felt Tom Clancy had shown little respect for his  readers, and forced us to endure a poorly told tale for the sake of meeting  his obligations to his publisher. Too bad. The Hunt for Red October,  Without Remorse, Clear and Present Danger, and Red Storm Rising are the  definitive Clancy. Everything thereafter is pretty awful ... especially  Rainbow Six.
B004SEUIWO|5|I did not make it to the theater when this came out and I am not much for renting dvd's ... Enjoyed the show!
B00AFROVQC|4|I love fantasy and having run out of all my usual authors, came across Morgan Rice. Yes, there may be errors (at one point Godfrey became Gareth mid paragraph) but even so, I have found these books gripping and enjoyable. I bought book one three weeks ago and have just finished book six!<br />I can't wait for the next book!
B00A8ECU24|5|I don't play farm games but I love this game!  I've been addicted since I started. Just one thing though: why is Rainbow Dash an insane amount of gems?
B000MV8ABS|5|Classic 80s Sci-Fi horror. An iconic representation of American fear - zombies, aliens, cemeteries, creepy hearses and flying bladed balls.  Crank the A/C and enjoy the chills.
B00004U30D|5|Wow ! I don't know what else to say. This is now my favorite movie of all time. It Rules !
B002QE3CTY|5|The whole book is a stick of dynamite all of the anticipation  of a resolution and suspense of death and triumph is an explosion of fun and adventure
0440237688|4|I am currently reading this as part of a class study on utopia and dystopia. My, but it was good! I'm supposed to read the book 45 pages at a time, but I read the whole thing instead, with chastisement from my teacher. At first Jonas' community seems like a fun place to be. You don't have to think for yourself, and, strangely enough, you don't want to because you're having too much fun. It is only when you see the truth behind these lies that the community seems only like a place to run away from. The book was very good. The characters were three-dimensional in a one-dimensional world, and the story was very well written. The only thing that really put me off was the description of what it really means to be released. That passage was horrific, gave me nightmares. The author could have made a milder statement that, while still making the point, didn't involve a newborn baby being murdered.<br /><br />Overall a very good story and worth reading.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Good game. Hours of fun and very easy to accomplish the goals and earn credits and coins. Strongly recommend this game.
B00DVKOYBM|5|is my favorite game and is amazing, the best game. i love this pool game because u get play any one u want to including ur friends.
B000F1IQN2|5|My favorite action movie used to be Bourne Identity, but it went down to the 2nd place after the release of Munich. Very good movie, it is true it's very long, but still a very good movie.
B00092ZMDY|5|What excellent type of group performance and their music still sounds awesome too!  I've been an \\"EAGLES'S Fan\\" off and on, however, in experiencing the spine tingling, arms' hairs-on-end, feeling of this stellar group's performance, I am definite hooked for \\"The Long Run\\"!  Don Henley is great, as usual, in his singing and drums.  Glen Frey is still awesome.  Timothy Schmidt is excellent in his playing and vocals, and specially in the two (2) songs he sings lead.  Don Felder's guitar is NOT missed at all because of Steuart Smith's identical reproduction, when called on!  What a professional job in Smith's performance!  Joe Walsh is exceptional in voice and funny character, but specially with his guitar picking. <br /> <br />This Tour I, as captured in this DVD, is a magical event for posterity.  I wish that the music tracks for this DVD, and specially because of the newer songs performed, could be made available in CD version. <br /> <br />This DVD is much better than \\"Hell Freezes Over\\", by far.  I guess that now with several \\"live\\" performances under their belts after their initial get-together, the group has once again found their \\"click\\".  We, as EAGLES fans, can only benefit tenfold by their continued performances and professionalism of trade. <br /> <br />OVERALL: This Tour I is a great documention of a \\"live\\" event in Melbourne, Australia, performed by gifted perfectionists who cry their hearts out in their music, and in their group performance.  The EAGLES are still soaring high, with no apparent downdraft to worry about.  This is for-sure 1970's music at its extreme best .......... in the 21st Century!
0553573403|5|Martin writes an engrossing tale by devoting each chapter to a hero or villian so you can see the world from that character's viewpoint. Each character is emotionally real and detailed and the events are realistic and gritty. Be forewarned, don't get too engrossed in any one character because he has no qualms about killing them off! The heroes and villians in this story are both capable of goodness and violence they seem so real that they make your imagination jump to new bounds. I've never read someone who can captivate me with writing like Martin and keep me wanting to read on until I'm so tired I have no choice but to put it down. Some of the best characters are the villians, like Sandor Clegane also called \\"The Hound\\". A former noble abused by his brothers violent temper and maimed for life with horrible burn scars on his face. Although he seems evil there is a deep sense of sadness and lack of love in this characters life. His frustration is evident and his good side although buried beneath so many years of abuse and ridicule, strives to reach the surface. You can see the tension and trauma this man has sustained, and through it all he still has a need to defend the weak and helpless. It's well worth the money for the book. I've read all three about four times already and I can't wait for the new one to arrive. All of my friends got hooked on the series after I told them about it. Probably the best books I've ever read. Nuff Said. Mike Ceranko
B006LSZECO|5|Great book, easy read. Unexpected twists!!
6304994540|5|Another mastrpiece of big brothers. Amasing performance, characters, plot, dialogs...everything. I saw this movie probabaly 20-25 times, but it`s still very enjoyable to me. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, John Tarturo, German gang and others are OUTSTANDING! One of the best picture I`ve ever seen in my life. BRAVO!!
B00J7UL6V6|4|This time the Black Keys have changed their musical direction quite radically (closer towards the ambitions of one of the currently busiest musical producers &#34;Danger Mouse&#34;).<br /><br />The album sounds a lot more electronic, melodic, more refined/commercial and moodier than previous releases, making it easier to get into, but in a way lose a bit touch with TBK's roots.<br /><br />Personally their older albums were a bit too &#34;dry&#34; for my musical taste and since I'm a big fan of Broken Bells, Gnarls Barkley and a few other albums where Danger Mouse did his magic (Feel Good Inc. by Gorillaz, or the latest from Portugal. The Man), this release is very appealing to me.<br /><br />Personal highlights are &#34;Bullet In The Brain&#34;, &#34;10 Lovers&#34; and then there is of course the Indie Rock Radio Darling &#34;Fever&#34; that will surely keep your head nodding for a while!
0812550706|4|It is a very interesting book and I would recommend it to anyone. If I had known it was that interesting, I would have bought it earlier.  So captivating and \\"unput downable\\".

B0071XO8RA|5|So far very interesting and unable to stop reading.
0679746048|5|Girl, Interrupted introduces you to Borderline Personality as well as to  Susanna as a teen-ager.  Would you decide not to sign in? Or would you  trust that the recommendation for signing into McLean Hospital was the  right thing to do?<br />Throughout this story, I wondered if the main  character really  was certifiable just as she was presented in the movie.    Unfortunately, I walked away with this: truth is what is recorded on papers  and reports, no matter what you believe.  <br />This is definitely a book  worth reading even if you saw the movie.
0743570200|4|I gave this 4 stars for being a story I listened to straight through (audio in car), a good yarn, and I always like to hear writers write about writers.  But it doesn't really have a lot of depth to keep me thinking about it over the years.  It’s like she had a good story idea but settled for fairly clunky/contrived and predictable ways to work it out.  Perhaps it became popular because of the ghostly subplot coming out just when vampire stories were all the rage?  Also as a personal miff, it felt like it used adoption (and twin) issues as an easy plot convenience rather than out of a depth of understanding, but that may just be a personal bias.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Simple and fun.
B004EPYZPS|5|this was a great movie. It had a great start and a nice ending. I loved it and I would watch it again.
B00C74SHRK|5|Such a dense and gripping read - I was emersed in the world of protagonist, some of the time this was agonising but always I wanted to keep travelling with the story. The descriptions of the painting &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; were entrancing and powerful.
B00U7VDC7A|4|Not a bad game, kinda slow going. But I enjoy playing.
1582701709|5|Excellent book.  I reviewed before my purchase and this purchase was for my friends and family as gifts. Couldn't wait to share it!
098555780X|5|There are a lot of knot books, but I have a hard time translating them into projects.  This book gives a bunch of project with cord length estimates, which I definitely need.  Easy to follow instructions.  I'm enjoying trying to make each project.  They don't look quite as good as in the pics, but I guess I need lots of practice!  Thanks for this book!
B007ONSLLQ|5|I love Halestorm's first album more than this one but not by much. They did re-vamp their sound, but still have a lot of awesome hits!
B003P2WO5E|5|The story is classically interesting with a grungy otherworldly landscape. Amazing amount of strife to arrive at the beginning of a story. Can't wait until the next one.

B0097JYVAU|3|Few new ideas and at the end a little booring, most concept presented with to much words and pages. Plv
B000PTYP5C|5|yes my friends you read correct. this album is defidently dream theater's strongest album sinse six degrees of innner turbulence. it is pretty much a mix of all of DT's best sides. best of their prog,metal,and more calm rock sides all mixed in one. and this is also their best playing sinse six degrees. the emotion from scenes is also brought back at times. jordan really shines on here. and petrucci plays some of his best solos ever! and the new 25 min epic is amazing!     here is a short song by song review,    In the prescense of enemies pt 1 - 5/5 -  amazing opener! Very Progressive track! opens up with a 5 min intromental insanity. sounds like a more heavy edged metropolis pt2! after a emotional transistion james kicks in about 5 mins into the song. after about 4 mins a crazy unisink between petrucci and rudess strats up. than there is a very smooth transistion into the next song.    Forsaken - 4.5/5  forsaken is a great track. its a more straight folward song. but its not like the slower songs on octavarium (witch i thought dragged a bit) this song is more like their classic ballads. just a bit heavyer. very catchy song    Constant Motion - 5/5  i love constant Motion its such a cool heavy progressive song! dream theater's metallica influence can clearly be heard on this song, but it is cool. i love the instromental section on this song. killer petrucci solo!    The Dark Eternal Night - 5/5  this is by far the heavyest song on the album. it has the style of TOT, but its more on the progressive side, and is done much better than TOT. The instromental section is sick! reminds me of dance of eternity! awsome song. one of the best on the album    Rependance - 5/5  a very moody more calm song. really well done vocal's. petrucci plays some tasty stuff on this song! reminds me of opeth's damnation. really cool track    Prophets Of War - 4/5  A good strange song. it is more straight folward than the other songs, and my least favorite from the album, but still a great song!     Ministry Of Lost Souls - 5/5  One of the highlights of the album! a great song with a great story to it. It has a scenes from a memory feel to it. very powerful synth useage. the 14 min epic song starts of very mellow, and eventlly transits into a heavy instromental section wich last quite a few mins. Petrucci plays a great damn Guitar solo! The song eventully transits into the emotional ending. and starts to fade off to john petrucci's amazing emotional catchy guitar line. mikes does some crazy drum fills over it.    In The Presense Of Enemies pt 2 - 5/5  part 2 of the epic is just as amazing as the first part. it starts off where the first left off. The track starts off calm and moody, and more vocal driven. It begins to built up, and it eventully builts to a verry proggy hard rock sound. than the song builts into a really heavy metal section, and the frighting instromental section kicks in for about 5 mins. That transists into the melodies from pt 1 of the song. and that conludes the song.    GREAT ALBUM!

B00HB92NIK|4|I was very skeptical going in how this movie was going to be.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My only wish is that I would have bought the movie instead of renting it.  It is one I would watch again and again.  I highly recommend this movie!
