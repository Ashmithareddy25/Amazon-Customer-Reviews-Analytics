B0099114WO|1.0|I love Meryl Streep and her last few movies have been great. Mama Mia, It's Complicated, Julie and Julia...all great. This movie was one of the few times I bought a movie before talking to anyone who had already seen it. It was just straight up depressing, not any comedy at all. Very bad....A waste of my money.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Title says it all she can only write Christian the main character is under developed. However she ends in such away I feel like book 2 is required
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I gave four stars only because of the switching point of view each chapter. It was hard to follow at times.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great. Couldn't put it down. Really loved the characters and their names are so cool. Ms Hoover is a fantastic writer and her narratives really grip you and  pull you into the page. Loved this story. Loved this book.

B0061S073A|4.0|I love the features of this app! I use it for my four year old. It has a timer, which is great for keeping track of how long he is on my Kindle Fire (1st gen). You are able to select which apps are accessible to your child and it requires a passcode to get back to the home screen of your device. The only issue I have had is that it clears out some of the selected apps and this actually happens fairly regularly. I really like it other than that, which is why I haven't deleted it. Four stars for a great app with one small glitches.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book makes you feel the pain and pleasure of both of the main characters. So much like 50 shades of grey but much much more intense. This book make  you want to scream and shout and it will leave you wanting more . I gave this sec ok nd book a 5 star rating because like I loved the first one this one is much more lovable .. I know anyone will love this book  can't wait for part 3 '''''' enjoy
0765325950|5.0|I started the series when the 1st book was originally published 23 years ago. A Memory of Light was a great finish. The Last Battle was as long and detailed at it should have been with 10,000 pages leading up to it. Of course, nothing is perfect! There could have been more to the Rand/Dark One finale but it was overshadowed by the fight itself. I will not pick it apart the way I have seen others do. For one author to pick up and finish a story of this size, and keep as close as he could to Jordan's intent, is a story in itself. It was a great and satisfying ending to a two decade plus story!
1780873808|5.0|This is the first of a projected three novels featuring Fin Macleod.  It is set in a grim, lonely island in Scotland, where Detective Macleod has been dispatched to investigate whether a local murder there is tied to a similar murder.  It's soon clear that this is not the work of a serial killer, and that this is not an &#34;ordinary&#34; investigation for Macleod.  He grew up on this forlorn island, and had no desire to return, but now that he has, he ends up confronting his demons in a series of flashbacks interspersed with the current crime investigation.  It is a splendidly written, engaging murder mystery, with a few surprises and a thrilling ending. I think it is my professional background in child protective services that tipped me off almost immediately to the secret, but that did nothing to spoil the story or the resolution for me.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Bought this movie for my boyfriend and watched it with him. Worth the price for the extended version. Good movie, would recommend it.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|Heard Ms. Thorn interviewed on NPR, liked the cut they played, liked her, so I bought a couple of CDs.  Sheesh!  She's very talented, but these songs are grim-city.

B007REV4YI|5.0|It is \\"considered the greatest internal security breach in modern British history,\\" and it happened on M's watch. Three months ago MI6 had a secret computer drive stolen, data that lists the identity of almost all of NATO's operatives embedded in terrorist groups across the globe. Today, as undercover MI6 agents persist in turning up dead, it may be that M dedicates some moments to mourning the passing of one particular agent, 007. Except it's hard to think of her indulging in useless sentimentality. In any case, her plate is full as she copes with the fallout of the missing hard drive. The Home Office is strongly suggesting that she retire.<br /><br />But all that is later on. SKYFALL opens with a thunderous extended action sequence set in Istanbul, as 007 and a fellow agent (Naomie Harris as \\"Eve\\") strive mightily to recover that same computer drive. The assumption is that this is yet another of the franchise's trademark breakneck opening sequences, complete with bells and whistles. But, in a shocking turn, 007 fails a mission and plunges to his death. Since this happens 15 or 20 minutes into the film, no one in the theater buys it. And so, on MI6's darkest hour, as a hidden adversary attacks the very heart of the British Secret Service, Commander Bond at last reports for duty. M's acerbic response: \\"Where the hell have you been?\\"<br /><br />I don't know that SKYFALL is the best Bond movie ever. I do know that it's really, really, really good. Coinciding with the film franchise's fiftieth anniversary, this movie is full-blooded escapism. It is invigorating and surprisingly sentimental. Daniel Craig continues his fantastic stripped-down interpretation, playing Bond as an intense, laconic man of action. This Bond very much recalls the toughness of Connery. Except Craig allows us to see the internal demons that have always plagued 007.<br /><br />In this back to basics James Bond era - for example, Q arms 007 only with a tiny tracking device and a Walther PPK equipped with a palm-print reader - the villains and the sexy women must not have gotten the memo. Javier Bardem plays the bizarre and theatrical cyberterrorist, \\"Raoul Silva,\\" whose off-kilter mannerisms mask a damaged pscyhe. French actress B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe is the film's token femme fatale. I don't know that Naomie Harris draws more screen time than Marlohe. Probably I was struck with her character's potential. I'm pretty sure this isn't the last we'd seen of the intrepid Eve.<br /><br />There's fantastic depth to SKYFALL. It lends itself to an intensely personal tone. It opens up a smidge of 007's backstory. Did you know that the film title refers to the name of Bond's family home? But more than anything, the heart of the film is the relationship between M and Bond. Their many-layered interplay, composed of polite spy talk and suppressed emotions, achieves a dramatic weight and an emotional complexity. \\"We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows,\\" Ralph Fiennes's vaguely smarmy official informs M, but that bit of reproach may as well apply to Bond. M and Bond are both regarded as dinosaurs, obsolete and irrelevant in today's cutting edge world of cyber espionage. One of the most absorbing elements in the film is that Bond is presented as antiquated, as past his prime and behind the times. Three months back from the dead, he's still recovering from his injuries. His right arm occasionally fails him. To me, this makes for an even more exciting Bond. SKYFALL demonstrates a respect for the Bond legacy but doesn't hesitate to reinvent itself. Throw in a surprise or two, a dusting off of several franchise staples, the exotic locales, the vigorous action sequences, and a terrific theme song by Adele, and maybe, just maybe, SKYFALL is the best James Bond film after all. At least, it's in the conversation. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are so wicked good.<br /><br />What I have is the blu-ray/DVD/digital copy combo.

B009M5CJI0|5.0|At first, I did not think I would like it as much as I did Book One: Fall of Giants becuse more of WWII was known to me.  But I really did enjoy reading about the War thru historical fiction.  It was easy to become involved in the many families (5) introduced in Book One.  However, this focused more on the children.  I would recommend it to history buffs, fiction lovers.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|I loved this book.  I read the whole thing over the course of a rather busy day, but it's an easy read, so it fit nicely into spare time.  Most of the characters aren't deeply developed, but the reason becomes apparent through the story.<br /><br />The book also leaves some interesting plot lines open for future development and the characters  that are developed are the kind you won't to have succeed in their journeys.<br /><br />I'll definitely be reading the later volumes of the series.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my first Nicholas Sparks book. I bought it because I live in North Carolina (and used to live in Wilmington and in New Bern). I never imagined where this book would take me. It was beautifully and believably written. Nicholas Sparks was able to express the emotion of the characters so well and write in a way that you felt you were inside their \\"heads\\". I could put myself in Katie's shoes, having been in an abusive relationship as a teenager that ended similarly and this book caused me to face emotions I didn't realize I needed to. The ending was equally powerful and, as weird as it is for me to say this, actually helped me to think of my relationship with my husband and kids in a new way. The unexpected twist at the end had me choked up and blindsided...but it was perfect. I absolutely adore this book and am seriously considering starting it all over right now...
B009SJ3H8Q|2.0|I was so impress and delighted with season one. I was sure season two was going to be hit.  To my dismay the second season is rather weak and the episodes at times are boring and not well connected. I must say the acting is superb, Jessica Lange and the rest of the cast deserve an A+. The  script deserve an F in my opinion.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer watched the DVD without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.<br /><br />King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.<br /><br />The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period. But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp, February 13movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch...

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I have been sober for over a decade, however watching the struggle that Denzel's character was experiencing with his decline in his addiction was so spot on.

It would seem that many people have a distinct distaste for UltraViolet.\\" - no kidding!<br /><br />Ultraviolet is inherently bad and the promise of being able to stream my movies from the cloud any time I like (and near a suitably quick wi-fi hotspot) certainly has merit but it comes with a cost that I'm not too fond of paying. The cost of freedom.<br /><br />UltraViolet won't play unless constantly connected to the internet for the sake of authentication.<br /><br />UltraViolet is not a true \\"digital copy\\".

B008393Q2O|4.0|I like that this app creates notes under different tabs with the ability to color code.  I needed something lightweight that was handy for to-do lists, shopping lists, a few class notes, ideas for writing projects I'm developing, etc., and this was just what I was looking for.  It's easy to use and easy to customize.  I also liked that the product was not free but still not expensive.  I hate the advertising that comes with free apps, but I'm still cheap enough that I hate to pay more than a few bucks for something when it's not necessary.

B00APUQJLO|1.0|I'm a big fan of Rob Pattinson's acting, so I really wanted to watch this just to see how he portrayed his character.  However, I found his character so repulsively insipid that I couldn't even enjoy watching the actor.  This seemed like a series of one-shots that continued without purpose, and the plot only served to show the lead character's inability to understand let alone engage with the outside world because he was unable to control it and/or find it stimulating for his overdeveloped ego.  The film's conclusion was neither satisfying nor motivational and brought no sense of significance to the pointless plot.  If this were an entree at a restaurant, I'd have sent it back to the kitchen and demanded a refund.

0765325950|4.0|Tarmon Gai'don is here. But it's not really the Last Battle. There will be other Last Battles. But it was a Last Battle.<br /><br />Caemlyn has fallen. And far to the north, at the Field of Merillor, the rules of the nations have gathered to hear the Dragon's demands before he goes north to face Ishamael/Moridin and then the Dark One. The confrontation between the Dark One and Rand will be interesting to those who want it to be interesting. Others will not like it. To each his own. I felt that Rand was used well, but that Nynaeve and Moraine were underused. This is quite sad considering how important Nynaeve has been among the characters of this series. Not even a single sniff out of her. Still her Crown of Sniffs is safe.<br /><br />Elsewhere we see the forces of the Light fighting the forces of the Shadow. Lots of fighting. And then there is the reveal of Demandred, which feels like a cop out.  Demandred is discovered and you'll be interested to know that while you don't get all the back story for Demandred in this book, you will get it as part of a short story to be released later in 2013 in a collection called River of Souls.<br /><br />The Last Battle chapter extends for 190 pages. The Egwene section might be the best of that. The Elayne section, as usual, is among the worst. The Mat portions are fine and the Perrin sections are interesting.  Then there is death. But not necessarily as you expect. Others will feel let down by this book. It's imperfect. It's not Jordan writing this. But then again, Jordan was writing rather terribly in books 8,9, and 10, although he did redeem himself a bit with 11. And then there's the epilogue, which Jordan wrote aside from the bits about Perrin and Loial. The epilogue raises enough questions that you will still be thinking about the ending and what it means.<br /><br />Having begun this series back in Autumn of 1995 when I was 15, and finishing it at 11:46pm on Saturday February 16, 2013, now that I'm 32, it feels like a huge portion of my life is over. For many who have read this series, there is an emotional tie that possibly clouds judgment about the quality of the series. I debated whether to give it four or five stars, but I had to settle for four because the book is imperfect, but not imperfect enough for me to not like it. And I'm sorry to say farewell to these characters and these books. Still, it is an end. Just not the end.<br /><br />I've been keeping track of sniffs through the series. For this book there are 14 sniffs<br />Jarid - I<br />Aludra - I<br />Moghedian - I<br />Aviendha - II<br />Darlin - I<br />Elayne - II<br />Lanfear - I<br />Tam - I<br />Moiraine - I<br />Berisha - I<br />Pevara - I<br />Silviana - I<br /><br />And for the series, Nynaeve is the clear winner with 55 sniffs. Elayne is runner up with 20. For all 14 books, excluding New Spring's 2 sniffs, there were 299 sniffs.<br /><br />Nynaeve - IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII(55)<br />Elayne - IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII (20)<br />Egwene - IIIII IIIII IIIII IIII (19)<br />Aviendha - IIIII IIIII IIII (14)<br />Suian - IIIII IIIII I (11)<br />Faile - IIIII IIII(9)<br />Moiraine - IIIII IIII (9)<br />Min - IIIII III (8)<br />Leane - IIIII II (7)<br />Joline - IIIII I (6)<br />Cadsuane - IIII<br />Elaida - IIII<br />Lanfear/Selene - IIII<br />Melaine - IIII<br />Romanda - IIII<br />Amys - III<br />Bair - III<br />Corvil - III<br />Dyelin - III<br />Idrien - III<br />Larine - III<br />Lelaine - III<br />Renee Harfor - III<br />Teslyn - III<br />Aludra - II<br />Beonin - II<br />Cook at Inn - II<br />Deira - II<br />Feraighin - II<br />Laras - II<br />Liandrin - II<br />Lini - II<br />Saerin - II<br />Setelle Anan - II<br />Sumeko - II<br />Tiana - II<br />Adine - I<br />Ailhuin - I<br />Alise - I<br />Alivia - I<br />Asne - I<br />Balwer - I<br />Barasine - I<br />Beldeine - I<br />Berisha - I<br />Berowin - I<br />Bornhold - I<br />Breane - I<br />Caira - I<br />Canler - I<br />Carlinya - I<br />Chubain - I<br />Corana - I<br />Daigian - I<br />Darlin - I<br />Edarra - I<br />Edelle - I<br />Ellorien - I<br />Essande - I<br />Erith - I<br />Females in Crowd - I<br />Galina - I<br />Garenia - I<br />Graendal - I<br />Jarid - I<br />Javindhra - I<br />Jeaine - I<br />Jeaine - I<br />Katerine - I<br />Kireyin - I<br />Latelle - I<br />Marin al'Vere - I<br />Merana - I<br />Mesaana - I<br />Merilille - I<br />Moghedian - I<br />Nesta din Reas - I<br />Nicola - I<br />Nildra - I<br />Nisao - I<br />Pevara - I<br />Renaile - I<br />Rendra - I<br />Rhiale - I<br />Samitsu - I<br />Semirhage - I<br />Seonid - I<br />Sevanna - I<br />Signet Ring Fellow - I<br />Silk Shopkeeper - I<br />Silviana - I<br />Somara - I<br />Sorilea - I<br />Suroth - I<br />Tam - I<br />Tavern Wenches at the Woman of Tanchico Inn - I<br />Tenobia - I<br />Therava - I<br />Tion - I<br />Tylin - I<br />Vandene - I<br />Vasha - I<br />Verin - I<br />Village Wisdom - I<br />Yukiri - I<br />Woman in Fal Dara - I<br />Women of Emond's Field - Iinya - I<br />Chubain - I<br />Corana - I<br />Daigian - I<br />Darlin - I<br />Edarra - I<br />Edelle - I<br />Ellorien - I<br />Essande - I<br />Erith - I<br />Females in Crowd - I<br />Galina - I<br />Garenia - I<br />Graendal - I<br />Jarid - I<br />Javindhra - I<br />Jeaine - I<br />Jeaine - I<br />Katerine - I<br />Kireyin - I<br />Latelle - I<br />Marin al'Vere - I<br />Merana - I<br />Mesaana - I<br />Merilille - I<br />Moghedian - I<br />Nesta din Reas - I<br />Nicola - I<br />Nildra - I<br />Nisao - I<br />Pevara - I<br />Renaile - I<br />Rendra - I<br />Rhiale - I<br />Samitsu - I<br />Semirhage - I<br />Seonid - I<br />Sevanna - I<br />Signet Ring Fellow - I<br />Silk Shopkeeper - I<br />Silviana - I<br />Somara - I<br />Sorilea - I<br />Suroth - I<br />Tam - I<br />Tavern Wenches at the Woman of Tanchico Inn - I<br />Tenobia - I<br />Therava - I<br />Tion - I<br />Tylin - I<br />Vandene - I<br />Vasha - I<br />Verin - I<br />Village Wisdom - I<br />Yukiri - I<br />Woman in Fal Dara - I<br />Women of Emond's Field - I

B00015YVD6|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a child/adolescent and it is never on TV anymore, so I had to bite the bullet and buy the DVD.  I am so glad I did.  It was just as funny as I remembered and I honestly think this movie stands the test of time.  Tom Hanks is hilarious and heart-warming and Daryl Hannah is perfectly cast as the angelic, naïve, charming mermaid.  John Candy is perfect as Allen Bauer's mischief-making brother and Eugene Levy (marine scientist) is great, too (my all-time favorite movie of Levy's is Best in Show).  The 20th anniversary edition of the DVD has the added bonus of interviews with Ron Howard (director), Brian Grazer (producer) and the cast which is just wonderful insight into the movie and very interesting to watch.  The ending is a little sadder than I remembered but I suppose it is the most appropriate ending considering society in the 1980s would not be very accepting of a mermaid living in their midst as opposed to today when a human that also has fins would probably be embraced with open arms.  The movie also showcases New York beautifully and it's fun to see all of the 80s fashions, electronics, etc...  A classic romantic comedy that I can (and have) watched over and over.
B002RI9M2U|3.0|I liked the way the story was told, the writer is very talented on making us want to know what is next.  I just didn't see real reasons for her suicide, but then again I am not a teenager anymore.  I thought most of the reasons were really weak.
B005FFW46S|4.0|If you enjoy the Watch stories from the Discworld, this book is for you.  If you haven't read any of them, do not start here. Check out Pratchett's lspace for the ordering.<br /><br />While definitely not my favorite Discworld book, I always enjoy the journey through Pratchett's world.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Loved every moment of the book. Very well written! The ending makes me want to grab the third book immediately! Great writing Suzanne!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I usually like Denzel Washington movies, and this movie had some good reviews, so I figured I'd rent it and see how it really was. Unfortunately, it just wasn't very good. While the underlying story is a good one (even heroes can suffer from addictions and need help), this movie wasn't that enjoyable for several reasons:<br /><br />1. A nude scene that was completely uncalled for and did nothing for the story. It seemed totally out of place and was just really stupid.<br /><br />2. Oh so much profanity! Again, this did nothing for the storyline and was just overkill. This movie would have only been better without it.<br /><br />3. The Christians in this movie are portrayed so falsely and weirdly that I really can't tell if the writer and director were mean-spirited or just ignorant. They neither acted nor spoke like any Christians I've ever met, and it was just a really poor portrayal of Christianity.<br /><br />In the end, there was very little in this movie that I liked. This may be my least favorite Denzel Washington movie ever.
030758836X|3.0|Not one appealing charater in the entire book.  The mystery kept me reading and wanting to find out what would happen to these equally unlikable people, but the ending was less than satisfying.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The best part is that it is from a true story.  Very marvelous how they could make the movie when most of it is wordless and focused on the actions of the dog, and so in command of your emotions.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great casting.  I couldn't stop watching this - watched the whole series in 2 weekends.  Pre-ordered the DVD for the 2nd season, because I don't want to wait to see what's next.  Wish it was on-line, so I could watch it now.  Highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought the first temple run was good but this one is awesome! I would recommend this game...it has good graphics and is tons of fun!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is extremely good im 11 and me and my mom love it<br />Can the next place be mexico
B004OC07F8|5.0|I've made it more than half way through and I've really changed my thinking about competition for the upcoming year.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I wasn't expecting too much out of Ghost Protocol, I figured what else could they really do that hadn't been done. I was wrong I really enjoyed this one and I am now hoping they will make MI5.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three books a half a dozen times since September 2012, and I absolutely love them!  Still don't know what it is about these books, but I love them and will definitely continue to read them.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This is a game of patience and concentration. It requires no permissions at all, yet it miraculously works. Other devs should take a page from this one's book.<br />My only complaint is the black/white doesn't work so well in daylight with the subtle contrast this game uses. However, this game is a gem. This is certainly one of the best uses of the tilt sensor.<br />I like a challenge in a game. This one has it, but it's not overwhelming if you slow down a little.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This app is worth a download as the Free App of the Day.  I'd probably pay $.99 for it as well.  Here are some things I noted after playing the game this morning.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />-Graphics--particularly how the developer uses lighting on the black and white screen<br />-Responsive Tilt based controls (at least on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9)<br />-Intuitive Game Play<br />-No permissions<br />-Price (Free/$.99)<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />-Pretty Repetitive....I think this is a fun game in the short term, but will probably get bored of it long term<br />-I experienced a couple quick blips where the game seemed to briefly freeze--so not sure how the game will work on older/slower devices<br /><br />Note:  The game does get more difficult as you go on in the game, but I don't mark that as a weakness.  If you want to play easier levels, you can replay the first few levels and try to get more stars.  The fact that it gets difficult and has 135 levels is a nice challenge and keeps folks from quickly beating the game.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|We love this series, and we now have the first 4 seasons.<br />It is a good tale for all the family.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Or at least that's what i expected... Although the game is fun and the graphic are great complete with all new features on the temple, it feels sort of confusing. Un-satisfying. Un-temple runish. Don't get me wrong, this is still a amazing app, and i do play it often, but personally i think the original is better. I feel that this one asks for you to pay more actual money a little more often; more demanding and in-your-face. Ads aren't a big deal, but it was the fact that Temple Run had no forced ads that made me respect it.<br />Overall, i give this product a 4 star. It's fun and sometimes exciting (ok maybe more than sometimes), but lacks the, \\"solid feeling\\" the original had. It wasn't my favorite, but I'm sure you will like it! Most people do.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|I've read this book twice now, gripping read from start to finish. Jack Reacher is as tough as ever, definitely worth reading
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's good and addicting! My friend showed it to me. I like that you don't have to tilt it like temple run
B005723JSQ|4.0|For the past few years I've been reading all of Kinsella's books. The reading is always very stimulating as you go through it, and this one felt the exact same, meaning, you don't really want to put it down. Nevertheless, I did know exactly what it was going to end like, halfway on, which felt a little bit disappointing.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I like the storyline of Kate Morton's books.  I like the back and forth time flow.  However, in reading all her books, I find her male characters are all weak and flat, not fully developed
1250027624|5.0|I gave this book this rating because I love all the Downton group both upstairs and down.  The book is awesome.  I would recommend these  books to anyone that likes to read or see pictures.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Amazing. No other words can describe this. A very inspiring artist who's not afraid to be different from the rest of the industry.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE THIS GAME SOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is so fun and addicting<br />My two year old sister is addicted to the game also.<br /><br />P.S. I am only 11 :)
B004UID2LC|4.0|I prefer the easier-to-navigate format used on my desktop, but, I'm sure I'll get used to the Kindle Fire version.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was awesome for the first 5 hours then it went down hill it won't work it doesn't play any more
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app!! It is really fun to play but can be addictive. I would say that it can be very hard and it is like a worse version of temple run.
B008518MOW|5.0|I gave my son this movie for Xmas. He. Enjoyed it very much and would recommend it. He has a 3d TV.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I got 90000 coins and it restarted me! Horrible don't waste your time!I hate this game and I'm never ever playing it again!!! Whoever made this app are idiots!!!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie is Dark , twisted and in my opinion has misuse of a child. Yuk. Kept me up all night freaked out.
1908117230|5.0|Great quality, product was described as it is and fast shipment, wish to do business with in the future. highly recommended.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John Hiatt is like an old freight train, he just keeps on moving!  Really digging this record, gets better with each listen.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED! I LOVE PAC MAN! WELL AT LEAST I USED TO! I EXPECT MORE INTO THIS GAME! I'M SORRY NAMCO BUT THIS IS ABSOULUTLY terrible
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. its so addicting. I play it wherever I go. I cant wait for the new update. though sometimes its a little slow.
1423136802|4.0|A friend of mine recommended the Percy Jackson series to me. I found it a lot of fun and very imaginitive. I've already recommended the series to a friend.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|I downloaded this and played 6 levels. I tried to close the app and my phone froze up. I pushed return and home nothing happened. Waited a while then the screen went black. Pushed power button and the phone turned on as if i shut it down. I will delete this app a soon as i finish entering this.
B009SJ46EA|2.0|**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Though I kept watching until the end, after about three episodes, I got tired of Season 2: it's too dark--literally--I had trouble seeing the action; too much gore (a self-inflicted, coat-hanger abortion, REALLY??); too much weird sci-fi; too much sadism (mommy rape?  Yuck.); no real depth to the characters; and it lacked the sense of humor/quirkiness of the first season.  I felt like I needed a shower after each episode.<br /><br />The more I think about Season 2 of AHS, the more I think I'll be skipping Season 3.  Life is too short, and it's grim enough already.
B003VANOFY|5.0|simply put, the best bloody headset that i've ever owned, and i will not own anything else ever in my life!
B005SZAEYO|4.0|I'm really torn by this series.  On the one hand, it's very original, quirky, creepy, odd, and compelling.  The acting is AMAZING, the characters are unforgettable, and the story is completely fresh.  On the other hand, it's incredibly and gratuitously perverted, insanely violent, and it is very clearly a vehicle for social conditioning (some of you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about).  I suspect the target audience is older teens and twenty-somethings, but I'm sure there's a very substantial adolescent audience, too, and that makes me sick...but I still had to give it four stars.<br /><br />This is NOT for the faint of heart.  Don't say nobody warned you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this as a filler while waiting on the next volume of several series I have been reading.  What a surprise.  I really liked this book, you must read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|yes, it is a.pretty good app. the only thing is that it's really only a once in a while game. Why?  because every five seconds is an ad!!!!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had to come back and review this app because my for year old and I are having so much fun playing it! I let my four year old draw the stickmen and play until he needs help. It is getting challenging enough that I have to go back and redo a level a few times before I can complete it! It is entertaining enough that you want to keep paying the level until you finish it. I find in this game like Angry Birds that if I get frustrated with a level that I can't beat I just need to give it a day and try again then I can usually do it. One of the funnest games I have found for my Kindle Fire yet!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Awesome!  Works perfectly on my kindle fire, easy to use, and sometimes just fun to play around with!  I would highly reccomend this app to anyone!  :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is great for all ages love it :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)  :) :) :) :)
0307887960|5.0|Great book! Would recommend to everyone trying to lose weight. Dr. Pierre Dukan is a genius. I love this book !
B008476HBM|4.0|More detailed than movie. I liked this book because it gives you an idea of what it was like in that time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Why? Why not just read this book. Not enough reviews will be able to even begin at how astoundingly beautifying this book is. So, go on and buy it, read it, and have your heart racing along with a few tears. There's a reason why this is one of the best books of the year and so, go on and find out the reason.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Title says it all!! Great book worth reading Love Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper! Hope the movie is good too
B00594XOZU|3.0|girl. looking 4 friends m or f. between 10 and 16. love the outdoors and hunting. age 15.live in maine.<br />AWESOMENESS!!!  :{)
B006LSZECO|1.0|Let me just start out with I wouldn't waste my time on this book.  Not only would I like a refund, but I wish I could get back the hours spent reading this crappy book.  This must have reached the best seller list because of some book club hype.  It is a boring ridiculous story with a ridiculous drawn out plot and terrible character development.  Don't waste your time on this book of ~400 pages of &#34;Amy gone, day three&#34;'  etc. etc,  Really?
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club is not a simple action movie about fighting or male fraternity (as some people believe it to be). This is a movie with serious counter-culture and anti-establishment attitude. It relentlessly criticizes the system, social norms, and popular beliefs. It achieves all that with a brilliant narrative style and clever dialogues. The plot, seemingly simple, delivers one of the best surprise twists at the end. This movie will remain to be one of the highest-rated films of all time and I suspect its popularity will grow even bigger with each generation.
0062197266|3.0|I would warn any new readers that this book is very frightening. It is violent and psychotic.  If you are a woman, you will be disturbed by the main characters, both the man who is psychotic and frightening and the woman who also has her own issues with partying, drinking and making bad decisions. The violence is graphic and makes you afraid.  Yes there are some pretty frightening people out there but thankfully most of my world of acquaintances and friends are nothing like that.  Reality check is needed.  This books has you on edge throughout and that is its purpose. I question the healthiness of that purpose.  What is it suppose to do for us? I have decided not to pursue this author.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run is a very fun game. I enjoy playing it every day. So I really think thqycyou should get this app.
B001EN71DG|4.0|I purchased the Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Theatrical Edition) two years ago when the price was reasonable. At first when I watched the movies they didn't seem to be in the correct aspect ratio. I realized I had to change the settings on my Blu-Ray player to send the correct 480p signal to my monitor. Upscaled with the BR player, the images are amazingly sharp and best of all its the original presentations. I am more than pleased with these copies. Just my two cents.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is good for all ages,I just wish it had this like going down the tubes to go to new worlds.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I am in love with this series!  It keeps the momentum and flow of interest growing every chapter!  I can't get enough!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is my favorite 007 movie yet! Daniel Craig is always amazing in everything he does. Javier Bardem is amazing as the bad guy.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I read it in one day because I was so caught up in the characters. I am starting book two right now.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great fun .  People say it's an angry birds rip off but I don't see it that way . Try it if you don't like it then delete it . Bet you won't ..
B006LRUVUA|1.0|Why don't they tell us up-front that we also have to install a program on the PC? I wanted RDP, and this isn't
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|This is a glorious recording of significant chunks from Richard Wagner's operas. Jonas Kaufmann possesses a magnificent voice and has the ability to actually inhabit the character he is singing. Acoustically this recording is first rate.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I loved &#34;The Cat Returns&#34; and I purchased this for a friend for Secret Sanata. I know he will enjoy it, and the seller was very kind. He helped make sure it came just in time. I was also happy with the price I paid for the item. Thank you!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|The Oncoming Storm is hands down one of the best metal albums in history. For those who dont know anything about what they are talking about, this band is part of the original forming of a sound. If you can name one band that Unearth sounds like before them, please let me know. They were one of the first bands to combine heavy ill riffs, talk singing, solos and breakdowns to meld this sound. Have you heard anything as heavy as Unearth? Listen to any breakdown out there right now and tell me you cant hear the influence this band has had. As a matter of fact, listen to any metal band that come out after 2004 and tell me that you can hear Unearth influence in their music. These guys deserve far more respect than they get.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this was a fun game for free until they sucked you in and wanted you to pay $5 bucks for it. meh
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is the familiar challenge, with bright new graphics, with great options and wonderful surprises.  It's the same, but somehow, kinder, more gentle.  It's ok to be obsessive with this version. I mean, if free cell has ever kicked your behind So, well worth the little bit of money.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good reading, funny,endearing and just downright entertaining and insightful of human linksnature. I think it deserves a star rating of four. Not 5 cause nothing is perfect.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Watched on Amazon Prime and loved the the convenience. Great  HD quality.<br />Watched season 1 also.<br />Well worth the money.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|Enjoyed this book, but went to buy the rest of series and they wanted $8.99 a book.  Sorry, but I don't pay that for e-books.  I like the 2.99 (which I paid for this one), but the publisher putting it up to $8.99 for each one was ridiculous.  That means I would be paying $32.00 for the rest of the books.  Sooo, until they come down to a normal price, I will not be buying anymore from them.  That is why I put one star.  The book is good.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Classic King!!<br />Love his short stories and how they catch you and transport you somewhere else for a little while.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I read all of these.  I read the last one first.  I would definitely recommend starting from the beginning.  Love this series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW, It has been a very very long time since I have been captivated by a story as I was by this Woo Omnibus.  Outstanding writing, excellent editing and a wonderful story line.  I couldn't hardly put this down from start till finish.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I read all of these.  I read the last one first.  I would definitely recommend starting from the beginning.  Love this series.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is an excellent app for sharing important documents or storing documents without having to carry a flashdrive around with you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the fact you can check the different outlooks for what you want to do. and the radar is better than my local weather app.
1416955070|4.0|I heard a lot of things about this series but I was a little hesitant, reason why I must be one of the last to discover it but better late than never!<br /><br />Now, this book isn't completely original or unpredictable, some typical storylines are used in it but some part felt really new to me. I liked the idea of the marks that gave power but were also dangerous, I also really enjoyed the twists that came several time renewed the interest I had in the story. I spend a really good time with this book and I hope the rest of the series will only get better. I want to discover more about the shadowshunters, whose i don't like that much by the way, there are a little too narrow minded to my taste and prone to treachery. I really enjoyed Luke, who is suffering more than it seems caught between two worlds and who must take actions with dire consequences. From what I've read of the different groups so far, I think it was always more wolf than nephilim, loyalty and force were important for him since the start.<br /><br /> I loved to see several creatures in the story and not just vampires, though I kind of like this new kind of bikers vampires, and werewolves. Those are the most cited, with the nephilim, aka shadowhunters, and the demons, but we got a glimpse of several fairies and others that I would like to read more of.<br />The plot is interesting, to see how a group by fear of extinction become more racist than ever and start taking drastic measures is a little reminder of historical events transposed in a universes of fantasy and mystical creatures. Perhaps it will serve to open the eyes of some readers but it's also something simply enjoyable to read, even if myself I can't stop to see the parallelism between fiction and history.  I wasn't completely taken by surprise by some revelations while others did surprise me.<br /><br />I spend really a good time reading this and I appreciated the books being divided in distinctive parts because it will help if you need to take a break but that being said... once started I didn't want to put it down so I didn't put the division to use but it's something I noted and loved. I'm really curious as how things will evolve but Valentine is a villain that I really dislike and I hope Jace and Clary will manage to create what they need, now Simon must be relieved too and he is moving character too.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you want some YA fantasy and love paranormal.ake a break but that being said... once started I didn't want to put it down so I didn't put the division to use but it's something I noted and loved.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This movie is now my favorite movie of all time.  Like many, I grew up watching all the Bond movies with my Dad and brothers.  I am a huge fan of everything 007.  Things that put me over the top: Aston DB5, Scottish Country side, incredible ending.  I love everything bout this movie. A true cinematic work of art.
B007BDLLRU|5.0|Increíble<br />Lo lei en un dia! me encanto lo fácil de encontrar esta literatura y autor en este medio.Gracias amazon por favor pongan mas libros y autores en español!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I am a little confused when trying to access some magazine articles.  Would like to purchase items pictured.  An Ikea style format where everything in the picture is for sale would be great.
B005JZBPHS|1.0|Everything went fine until season 3. The discs were brand new and completely sealed when we received them, but for some reason season 3 skips to the point you cannot watch it. I spent hard earned money on the entire series collection and now we have to miss out on an entire season. NOT HAPPY!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love home decorating an eBay is the first thing that comes to mind for me.  I live in Houston, and I wonder if we have any eBay consignment stores.  Would love to sell some items.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I started reading Lee Child's book titled One Shot  because the movie came out. Great book, great movie.<br />I was like just about everyone else who reads Lee Child's books. You are hooked! It was<br />only logical to start at the beginning of the series with Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1).<br />What a page turner!
B007SGM084|5.0|All I can say is that it left me wanting more and more!! Best series that I have ever read!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am continuing to read through the Jack Reacher series. The stories<br />are thrilling and well written. What a great character.

B00111YM5G|1.0|Terrible movie do not waste your money.  Not worth owning, go to the library and take it out.  I donated the one I bought to our local library.
B0002HWQEE|5.0|This is just a lovely toy.  Solid and well built, adorable, durable, and well-balanced (so that it doesn't fall over sideways, like some other pull toys.)  My grandson loves it.  It's so cute to see this dog's tail wagging while my grandson pulls it around the house  :-)
0452289963|5.0|This book explains so much for me! Some reviews say its nothing new, but for me, it was an in depth explanation of the human state. Yes, I know not to let what other people say bother me, but why does it? And how do I NOT let it?<br /><br />The explanation of the ego and the human brain connects to scientific theories of human evolution of the frontal lobe and thinking of the future. While our biological growth has advanced the human race it leaves many of us unsatisfied with life. We are unsatisfied because that's our biology. We wouldn't be successful as a race if we didn't desire so much growth and achievement and social recognition. The only way to be happy and satisfied is to recognize this as our paradox.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really like this app and how it breaks down the amount of battery charge in terms of hours left to watch a video or read a book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Keeps them entertained, they try to spell words and I get 20 minutes of peace and quiet! Ok not always quiet when they count coins at the end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Few books have held my utmost attention; so a trilogy that held me captive is quite rare.  I loved Lisbeth's character.  I wanted this \\"bad ass\\" with her own moral compass to prevail.  Too bad Mr. Larsson will not be able to construct more adventures for this atypical heroine.  Rest in peace and THANK YOU.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use, great graphics, no lag.  I enjoy this because it males me think a bit, but not too much
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Bought 4 copies for friends, loved it!  Found Paul McCartney to be sereine and happy, it is a music that brings out tenderness.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I am an athletic trainer and physical therapist, and my day to day routine is exercise prescription.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on my Mac, my PC, my phone and my tablet. I love that I can make notes about my ideas or projects and have them sync across my devices to be updated whenever something occurs to me!

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great Movie.....you will not be displeased.  I thought this was going to be corney, but it is a great movie that I am going to buy.  If you like action, blood, guts and mayhem you should pop some corn and watch this movie :)

0884271153|3.0|It's Not Luck is the follow-up of &#34;The Goal&#34; which, probably by far, Goldratt's best known work in which he introduces the concept the Theory of Constraints. In &#34;It's Not Luck&#34; he introduces &#34;The Thinking Processes&#34; as a way to analyze a system and trying to find a way to break the constraint in the system. The book is written as a business novel and I found it a very easy read, yet... I didn't find it as insightful as &#34;The Goal&#34;.<br /><br />The story follows Alex, who is a senior manager at a firm responsible for 3 divisions. In the past, he has had enormous success in turning businesses around. Now he is heading three large departments that are outside the core business of the company. The CEO will be leaving and he wants to re-structure the group and therefore the three departments Alex is in charge of will either need to be suddenly enormously successful or else they'll get sold. Alex is obviously not happy with that and will need to do *something* that will turn these 3 companies around.<br /><br />Alex uses &#34;The Thinking Process&#34; as a way of analyzing the current situation and speculating potential future situations. From these future situations, he then works back to find the constraints and tries to break these. This technique is the main technique that is promoted in this book. He first uses it one one of the companies and it turns out to be incredibly successful. They find a new business model and that way turn the company unexpectedly around. The same will need to happen for the other companies if Alex has any chance of success. Will he be able to do that? I'll leave it here and you can read the rest yourself.<br /><br />&#34;It's Not Luck&#34; was very easy to read. It was well written and kept me engaged and I read it fairly quickly. It was interesting to follow Alex and see how he would resolve the problems in his companies using &#34;The Thinking Process.&#34; However, the book never gave me the insights that &#34;The Goal&#34; gave me. I found it hard to imagine how and when I would to use &#34;The Thinking Process&#34; in real life. I guess this book would just be a start and further study would be needed. I've been doubting whether it ought to be 3 or 4 stars. 4 stars because it was well written and an easy read. Three stars because I had hoped for more insight and was a bit disappointed (due my high expectations). I decided to stay with 3 stars.34;The Goal&#34; gave me.

B004SIP6ZE|4.0|A CLASSIC LIKE IT A LOT WHAT CAN I SAY I LIKE BRANDON LEE IN THIS MOVIE 4 STARS BY
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I give this 5 stars cause the story of Downton Abbey is great.  But also the packaging to receive season 1 and 2 together is great.  I read some complaints about the last episode and the Christmas special missing from season 2 on this collection.  That is not the case because it can be found in the last DVD of season 2 which if you look at the labeling seems to be a DVD of extras. I highly recommend this series.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very good game for the kids to play a good starter for them to learn from to play other game
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The movie kept us on the edge of our seats.  After all, how can you go wrong with Denzel Washington.  He's the best.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very fun to play on the road trip, excellent with graphic and easy of use, kids play with us too
B00ATSBIIG|2.0|I don't usually pay for games but this is the second time on the kindle it took my money n downloaded but won't install so I think I'll stick to the free games,  otherwise I might as well go just throw my money in the trash. well i&rsquo;m hoping maybe I'll have luck n it will install later. the game looked good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very loud and engaging, kids love this and make them think about what they are doing build good skill for them indirectly
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This is a good movie.  I enjoy being able to watch it anytime.  I don't know the rating, but I wouldn't show it to someone younger than 12 or 13.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|what else can you say, it fun to play and you can play for hours with, great for road trip
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|This game is really great! The tilt control work wonderfully on my Galaxy S Vibrant which is not the newest device on the market. (I saw a few reviews that complained about the controls) At first, I wasn't sure how the levels would get harder but as I went on they got much harder. This is truly a great game!
B008MEM24S|3.0|This game is ok not very fast like other, but if my child enjoys playing for a few then its well worth it.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Great sequel to the first book, \\" Beautiful Creatures.\\" Personally I enjoyed this read about more than the first book and am excited to continue the series!!

B008KE3960|3.0|Very easy to play , they enjoyed it just point with finger and draw and they will be fine. Ok
B009QD0MYQ|4.0|Was looking for something different and found it. Similar to Evanescence and Epica, Hope they make more albums. Heavy on one hand but angelic on another, can pass on the mellow tracks though...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They like playing this game graphic good, noise level good, easy of playing good, very good for the kids to play
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved the first film, the second was okay but the third film brought it all home. Great collection and well worth the price. Got this for next to nothing on one of the specials, would have paid full price after watching...
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy using this help me out on the weather all the time i would recommend this for everyone who has a kindle
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|When I grow up (40 now) I want to be Indiana Jones. Great movies and the Blu-Rays are excellent quality. Watch this with my kids frequently and have had several friends borrow to watch with theirs. Audio is awesome too!
B007WFTFG6|4.0|She likes the colors and like to draw, it engages her and for 2 1/2 she is doing very good with it
B002M9WW30|4.0|Bought for a buddy for Christmas, he loves it and has been watching with his kids. Blu-Ray's are nice quality and the movies are better than I remember (borrowed), well worth buying...
B005LHOKFS|3.0|The full version online is better, but this does the job and can not complain. I just like the full version
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Just watched the whole collection with my kids, fantastic. I remember when these came out and was blown away. The Blu-Rays still capture the magic and would wow anyone today, bought it cheap, watch for the specials and you can do the same :)
B009E3EY38|5.0|Led Zeppelin. the very best. nothing more to say. I also found the editing on the DVD very choppy, never staying on any one person for very long. I think that could have been better.....but it is all terrific
B00881VLCE|5.0|I I I I I I I I o o o o I I I I I I love kit so much jdbfisj Nebr kdbd j sud Jd Sid dodvf rjs I am using up space this should allow me to get a free minecraft
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book had way too much medical terminology in it. Very hard to understand. Heaven is for real is a much better book.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I actually wanted to see this at the theater but things kept coming up so we missed it--I'm glad we did. It ain't cheap going to the movies in Manhattan for a family of four, and I would have felt like a chump dropping a minimum of $40.00 (matinee) on this film. It's not awful, it is just so Adam Sandler. I think that says it all. If you like him, you will like this movie. I don't and I was immune to this movie's charms.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game it is super fun and is very interactive and cool I highly rcomend it plus it is free!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Love it. Mysterious. Great love story. Action. Revenge. Far better vampire series than other movies recently made. Actually love the Tv series more than the books!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is such a great app. i play it all the time. it has mobs, creative mode, survival mode, creepers, zombies, skeletons, spiders, and more cool stuff! i would recommend this to everyone.it is 6.99
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love this show. Watched the whole season over a long weekend! MYSTERIOUS. Compelling. Reminds me of Gossip Girl meets Revenge meets Lost. The setting is in a small town high school. Four friends come together after a five friend mysteriously dies. The friends are threatened throughout the series by A. The friends suspect several classmates and family friends. Action. Romance. Thrills. Great series.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i think that this is a fantastic album, and she also has a one-of-a-kind voice that no one else has. i would recommend this to people who love one-of-a-kind music. she is fantastic.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|Tom Cruise is a horrible actor and the movie has no story line. If you like special effects you will like the movie.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great price! I am a batman fan and i enjoyed this combo pack plus the extras that came with the dvds!
B00B44XVZC|5.0|This series is so good. I can't get enough of the illustrious and luscious stories. Willingham truly makes these classic stories come to life in vibrant and exciting ways.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Moved very slowly.  Although touching, too much daughter. Connelly is good but Bosch is getting old.  Parts of the book read like the author had a daily page goal.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The various games I play basically require this device in order for me to completely enjoy playing. I lost my first memory card therefore I'm starting again. Game on!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I sat down and watched the intire season one and two the day they arrived.<br /> I am so disapointed that tonight is the series final for this season.<br />. I am certainaly going to have to buy season three so I can watch them over and over till next season. I can't wait !
B004B63M1S|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, but I love it!  A masterpiece of grindhouse schlock that can be funny and violent at the same time.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I definitely thought this book was the best so far! Curious to see where the story will go from here.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very relevant to what is happening in our world, and could be prophetic.  Loved the writing style.  Can't wait to read the other two.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a very enjoyable game to play when you're bored. I enjoy playing this game as it allows you to slide your finger in any direction you would like to move your character.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game but then you don't know what things are or what's going to happen until after it happens. And it took awhile to figure out what was money credits and energy and how much each items actually cost
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun you should try it the first temple run wad okay but this is waaaaaaaaaaaay better
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This book makes me look at people in a different way. I did find this book very enjoyable, it made me want to see the movie. I have now watched it 4 times. Like the book you can't just read it once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|After playing this game on the computer I decided to spend 7 bucks and try this game and it is WONDERFUL me and my friend are always playing it. It is well worth the  7 bucks I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes to have fun.
B004EXLDFU|1.0|Such a stupid plot twist completely killed the development of the entire story line.  Olivia who is trapped in the alternate universe, risks everything to break into the lab, and for a moment manages to cross back into her universe, just long enough to beg a night cleaning lady to pass on a vital message to Peter.  Cleaning lady calls Peter late at night and passes on the message, stating that real Olivia is trapped in the alternate universe.<br /><br />Having such vital, game changing piece of intel, Peter gets up in the middle of the night, to SNOOP around like a little boy, and then decides to just randomly type in passwords to hack planted Olivias laptop...<br /><br />Yeeeaaap.  This is the dude thats been doing all kinds of shady, under the table deals in every nasty crevice of the world, and instead of soundly going to sleep, so he can safely burn her the next day, or I don't know, maybe even run surveillance on her for EVERYTHING shes got, nope, he's going to immediately tell her that he knows she's a plant.<br /><br />Further more, while under her gun, Peter proceeds to INJECT himself with unknown compound, simply because planted Olivia is forcing him to.  He does kind of inquire if it'll kill him, but I guess for a fella that feels right at home in places like Iraq, doing something to him self that'll conveniently look like a suicide, apparently makes total sense.<br /><br />This kind of a plot twist, is simply insulting, and after that scene they could have cut away right to ScoobyDoo.  I don't care that for some reason injection was not deadly, and Peter is going to wake up, none of that matters.<br /><br />Once story credibility is blown, there's no way of recovering it.  The entire development of the series was turned into a cheap joke literally in a matter of 7 minutes.<br /><br />Peters character was positioned as the prime focus point of the whole plot, he's the one who is supposed to activate the next phase of the operation, and he is a complete idiot.  From this point on, he might as well walk around in a sagging diaper while sucking on his thumb.<br /><br />Ludicrous waste of time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I rate this product as excellent!! Very happy that I purchased it! I would recommend every Walking Dead fan to buy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those books that you end up throwing frozen dinners in the microwave for your family because you just HAVE to read the next page. At least that's how 90% of it is. I was completely smitten with fascination on the entire idea. It's almost a \\"Why didn't I think of this?\\" moment. There are two parts. The first half in Nick's POV and the second in Amy's. Essentially their marriage has fizzled to nothing more than a toleration for each other. There are excerpts of Amy's diary that are in the first portion of Nick's POV that lead you to believe the obvious. You see, Nick has come home to find the house in shambles and Amy's nowhere to be found. Of course, the first suspect is always the spouse. Next, unfolds pure genius writing. I was dumbfounded and excited at the same time. Giddy even...<br /><br />And then there's the last 10%. The worst part is that it was the LAST 10%. The story is so gripping and explodes with climax. But the ending was horrible.. HORRIBLE!! I don't regret reading it because, let's face it, most books don't end the right way. But the ending.. GAH! So, so disappointing.<br /><br />I'm definitely not suggesting that it's not worth the read. On the contrary, I hope for the complete opposite. Creative writing to this capacity comes around so rarely it would be a shame to let this one pass by.
158234082X|4.0|I am a relatively recent fan of Anthony Bourdain and enjoyed reading about his background. I love how the real cooking starts &#34;after hours&#34;.
B002EMESSM|5.0|An excellent movie, even if you've never seen an episode of Star Trek...  Even after so many years, I can still watch this movie.  I love it!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We all fell asleep.  I don't get the popularity of this.  Maybe I am too old. My husband never suggests turning off a movie if he has paid for it.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln at the end of our Civil War was probably one of the most emotionally and politically traumatizing events in our history up to that time. Lincoln, almost universally considered our best and most effective president, had led the country through the War; and Lee's army had just recently surrendered. In the aftermath of assassination, virtually everyone who had any connection to, or association with, John Wilkes Booth, the primary conspirator, was rounded up and incarcerated. There was a government-directed effort to rush to judgement...to get past the trial; punish the offenders; and return the country to normalcy ASAP. To expedite the trial, a military tribunal was used...the civilian perpetrators were tried in a military court, without benefit of trial by jury. Mary Surratt, who ran the boarding house where the conspirators met, was arrested and charged with conspiracy too and this fine historical drama tells her story. One of the conspirators, still at large, was her son, John, and the thinking was that charging and trying his mother would flush him out. It didn't, John Surratt was tried by jury a year later and walked. This is the first film produced by the American Film Company, which was founded on the noble belief that historical films are more compelling than fiction. It was masterfully crafted by Robert Redford behind the camera and features superb performances by Robin Wright as Mary Surratt; and James McAvoy, as her defense lawyer, Frederick Aiken. Evan Rachel Wood, Alexis Bledel, Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline deliver fine performances too in support roles. Hopefully this is just the first of other films of this nature to be produced during the sesquicentennial anniversary years of the Civil War. This one carries my highest recommendation.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Portrays a young boy who suffers from depression. He starts high school just out of the hospital. He meets some seniors who befriend him and movie tells about their experiences. Also, there are flashbacks to his aunt's suicide which helps explain his illness. \\"Charlie\\" is such an appealing character.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Decent selection of songs, but there were a number of songs I would have liked to include, and some that were on the list that I didn't like (and one wasn't even really a song).
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It seemed to miss on so many levels. Others must see more here than I do.  I would say it is an accurate account of alcoholism.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I'm a fan of the video game so I thought I would give it a chance. Not worth the 3.99 we paid. I feel like the studio that produced this movie should reimburse us for sitting through it.
B009VB97EY|3.0|but there is no &#34;real meat&#34; in this story.  It was boring after a while and I was glad when it was over.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie...I found myself rooting for John Hawkes' character the entire time.  This cast did a phenomenal job. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to see an quirky love story. There is some nudity so if your are easily offended, you should take a pass as you will see a bit more of Helen Hunt than you probably have seen in the past.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I am not a big fan of musicals but this was so much more.  I loved the actors and felt happy after watching this. Worth the rental fee!
B00571F26Y|4.0|I was diagnosed with Celiac disease many years ago and this book made me re-think gluten free foods and that maybe I should eliminate them from my diet. The one area that he did not address, except for a reference, is that gluten is used as a filler in many drugs and unless YOU research it yourself you will never know because most pharmacists do not know if a product is gluten free. I have used the web site he mentioned.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|If the series had not already jumped head first into the shootemup blowemup endless string of generic mayhem movies, it has now. Strictly reviewed as a Bond film, its in the lower half. At least the word \\"spy\\" is used at some point during the film. Bardem was endlessly menacing in No Country for Old Men. Here he is a caricuture. Who cares about M? Nobody could conceivably be watching the movie for her. A maze of bullets and explosions and OH! surprise one gets through. A good series sold out and dumbed down to the most generic of formulas. PITY. Even the absurd scenes (every Bond has at least one) are so dumbed down with no tongue-in-cheek at all. No memorable lines. And and yes another guilt-strewn apology to gays, life would not be complete without another 21st century holloywood obligatory homage/apology to sex gone awry. It's BOND - 007 !!!!!!! Not James Bondage. Somebody please make a real Bond movie!!!!! This is embarrassing.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I was very pleased with how quickly it arrived! I will definitely order from this company again! Product was still wrapped in original plastic and case was not cracked. I have a very happy lil guy now! :)
0446581356|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it is fail proof and user friendly. The techniques are easy and they work! I am learning so much. I love the idea that the references are useful and excellent advice. Great tool to have for life with timeless tips
B005CGI4EG|3.0|Once again a very cheap price for a fun series. I wish that it had the original music in the opening sequence. Miss the &#34;Love and Marriage&#34; song. But a great value for this series.
B005LAII3U|3.0|I do like how they changed the concept up a bit instead of just redoing it all around, but the first version was much better, although the effects were obviously much better in this one.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|RIP Chris Kyle. This book was all that I expected and more.  This is a must read for all patriots.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I enjoyed the mythology of this book. I don't like the shared narration, but I think the younger readers will enjoy it.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Love this author!  Great character development.  Amazing imagination.  Convincing and well thought out magic systems in each book.  Smooth and intelligent dialogue.  This has everything going for it.  Now on to the next book in this world... Alloy of Law.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Strong performances - visually beautiful - this film has captured my family's attention. We're not big movie buffs but will watch this one repeatedly, and then talk about the new things we've discovered with each viewing. Definitely a favorite! The music is mesmerizing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app  It's simple to use and works great on my kindle fire . I have  tried others and did not like them at all ...
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Does exactly what it is designed to do.  Works every time converting my firewire accessories giving me the max speed I need for video viewing
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Great novel. Thought provoking and totally enjoyable. I have recommended to family and friends. I have read and enjoyed three of Picoults books. Looming forward to more.
1452110581|5.0|Bought this for my mum as a present to celebrate the arrival of a new kitten, and she absolutely loved it! Cleverly written for the most part, this book is really cute and quirky. Ideal present for a cat lover!
0062014102|5.0|This book was recommended by a neurosurgeon MD who had a NDE. The book may be slow reading to fully understand what is being written and the implications being presented, but the time and effort is WELL worth it. Anyone who is interested in holography, cosmology, physics, psychology or religious faith should enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever entertaining enjoying fun and full of adventure everyone should download this is a must have game
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it but there is a thing that you can choose to fall asleep to your music but you have to pay money to do it. :(
B004LWZW6U|5.0|Looking for a 3D movie for a new tv. Not for kids. As far as the 3D I recommend it, the 3D works very well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They should make a number two best game ever I love it if they make a number two I'm downloading it
B000301YY8|5.0|Ever since I heard this man sing his monster hit...You're Beautiful....I have become a huge fan of his.  He writes most of his music and sounds great when he sings.  I recommend this music...as it is both refreshing and enjoyable.  James Blunt knows how to tell a story...and sing it very well.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Cool<br />I chose this kind of story so  it could teach my children how Greg's life is I reviewed it a five star be cause my children loved it I have never seen the children so happy over a book!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the glitch i was experiencing is now gone. LOVE this game, wish dragons didnt take so many damn hours though. I play on my kindle fire and had problems for a while but everything is great. Thank you!
B009EEFTMC|1.0|Bought for 99 due to confusing blog entry published at 10:30 P m and read the next morning. come on now free for less than 2 hours...?<br />This app is mindless and the noise and effects irritating, so like the other reviewers shut all sounds off. Simple, not challenging, good if you need something mindless to do
B007PT1PEY|5.0|It's pleasure to read Sherlock Holmes in such good formatted ebook. 5 stars and it's  definitely worth it's low price.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|That said, is why I've watched Bond movie's of past. Whatever their unbelievable techno weirdness, plus the unbelievable scenes; always made for so much fun, action, who knows what romance that might kill Bond, oh so much fun.<br />If I want deep & a philosophical whodunit, then I'll view elsewhere. So this Bond was not my cuppa tea.
B0078PC030|4.0|Rented this so that my 8 year old son could see it.  I didn't remember the details of it, but just the general \\"lost in the backyard\\" stuff.  We all enjoyed it, but I found it so funny that the adults are not all that bothered by the fact that their kids have been \\"shrunk\\".  They go to bed while the kids are lost and even sit down to have breakfast before beginning the search again.  This cracked me up!  Still a fun movie.  Interesting how your perspective changes onces you are an adult, yourself, and have kids of your own :)  My son enjoyed it, and so did we!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|The first few Transformers movies had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. And still I actually managed to sit all the way through them. I got about 45 minutes into this one and couldn't go on. Awful.
0307716546|4.0|Interesting narrative style, however research in clinical field has been overstated for effect., However, still a good read, holds your attention
B000JMKRKC|5.0|After reading several book reviews, I chose The Thirteenth Tale for my book club.  We have been together for over twenty years so I want the books I choose when it is my turn to be worthwhile.  I quickly fell into this story with just the right amount of twists and turns.  I am a fan of stories that take you back and forth in time and this did not disappoint.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|All three books were a good read. The story line was good to follow and enjoyable. I will read them again
B001IYCMNA|1.0|As a Cisco shareholder I was excited to purchase two of these for use in my house. Upon opening them and reading the manual I realized that the documentation was ambiguous and generally unhelpful in setup. The &#34;access key&#34; is nowhere to be found. I called Cisco Support only to learn that after I created a profile I needed to have a service contract in order to get support...on a $150 item?  I buy about $15M in networking gear for my business and have always been a loyal Cisco buyer. My experience with them on the prosumer front has left a very bad taste in my mouth. I may need to look elsewhere next time I'm buying professional equipment.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|To be honest, I noticed this series after the price was discounted. The reviews looked good and I had nothing to loose. The first book was a little hard to get into but after a few chapters I was hooked and went through all 5 books in relative short order.  I was a little disappointed in the ending which resulted in a lost star. However, I see there are other follow on books. So my journey isn't over yet. I recommend these books to anyone into post apocalyptic books. The characters and circumstances were interesting and compelling.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I am reading the Sigma Force series in order. This one is as interesting and enjoyable as the others. I highly recommend all of these books. The scientific and historical facts that form the foundation for the books are fascinating, educational, and scary! Do read these books. You will be glad you did.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|This is my first CD by Sade.  I have heard snippets of her music, but for whatever reason never dived in.  So I approach this music with a fresh ear.  The opener \\"The Moon & the Sky\\" floors me!  Sade's vocals are expressive as the melody snakes seductively, \\"You left me there dying, but you'll never let me go.\\"  \\"Morning Bird\\" is another track that catches my ear.  It's a eulogy with the stark piano & Sade's voice melancholy, \\"There's nowhere I can find peace & the silence won't cease.\\"  \\"In Another Time\\" is a lovely slow song with Stuart Matthewman's sax spicing the mix.  Other tracks like \\"Babyfather\\" & \\"The Safest Place\\" are also gems.  Enjoy!
B005H0IW6W|2.0|Did not like the song &#34;Santa Baby&#34; version he did.  Overall it was just an okay album.  Would not recommend it.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This CD has many of my favorite songs of theirs and was priced right.  Boston is a classic and I would buy again
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play every day and love it. Would like if I got more bingo plays when I get a bingo
B00973902K|5.0|Used in the bedroom by a window.  Nice cushy feel when you sit and storage to boot. For the price , nice product!!
B00A0MJA1I|3.0|The quality of the film you get is ok. The picture is sharp and clear. The sound is good .. BUT .. If Disney is going to release a film and call it restored, then they should be honest and actually DO IT. This version is still missing a very nice scene after the bomb explodes in Peter's tree. Peter finds Tinkerbell very weak and her light is going out. He turns to the audience and asks you to believe and say &#34;I believe in fairies.&#34; Tinkerbell's light gets stronger and she is healed by the power of the children's belief in fairies. That whole scene has been deleted. Now, Peter finds her in the tree and it just jumps to the next scene with Captain Hook.<br /><br />  Also, you can't watch the blu ray copy with the commentary. You have to watch the plain DVD copy if you want some of the original extras. They are not on the blu ray disc.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|\\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" was an amazing film.  The soundtrack seemed to pop around the action and carry the film forward.  This soundtrack collection is excellent.  Yes, not everything from the film is here, but what is here keeps me spinning the disc.  The star track is \\"Always Alright\\" by Alabama Shakes.  (I saw the band on Saturday night live last night and will have to pop for their CD!)  The track has such a great bass line with the lead singer knocking it out of the park, \\"We're always all right!\\"  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Ambrosia Parsley & the Elegant Too is another delight that slinks along with a circus-like riff.  Eagles of Metal Death's \\"Now I'm a Fool\\" has an addictive beat and an expressive vocal, \\"But nothing is real, even what you can feel is illusion, suddenly you appear out of the smoke and haze and I think that you've got me falling for you.\\"  I bought Bob Dylan's [[ASIN:B00028HODG Nashville Skyline]] when I was a teenager.  At the time, I thought that Dylan and Cash sounded like they'd been at the pub before they hit the recording studio.  But the song has such a lovely melody that these two classic artists sound fresher to me today.  Sting did a sweet version on it on the [[ASIN:B006H3MIV8 Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan]] CD.  The closing track by the Dave Brubeck Quartet of the Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim classic \\"Maria\\" is utter ambrosia.  Even though it was recorded in 1960, it was not on my radar screen prior to this set!  \\"Buffalo,\\" \\"Silver Lining\\" and the brief Danny Elfman instrumental \\"Walking Home\\" also are treats.  For me, this is an exceptional soundtrack to an exceptional film!  Enjoy!

B000AJIF4E|3.0|I've had these headphones about a week (as of 2/17/2013).  I've done about 40 hours of &#34;burn in&#34;.<br /><br />The GOOD:  They are very comfortable to wear and have very low leakage.  I'm very impressed that packed with the headphones (the back card) is the entire list of EACH and * EVERY * part in the headphone in an exploded diagram.  This implies that you can - if you wanted - repair these instead of treating them as a throwaway item in this throwaway society.  I applaud this.<br /><br />SONIC INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:<br /><br />HIGHS:  I like that the highs are very clear yet unexaggerated - without cutting your ears to pieces.  This is something I find most headphones fail at.  Sony has figured how to EQ the treble without going over the cliff , or faltering so to speak.<br /><br />MIDRANGE:  Initially a bit forward, it is rapidly getting mellower with burn-in.<br /><br />BASS:  It's there but on it's own terms.  I.e. you are not going to EQ this into a bass monster.  It has it's own mind.  You can almost go backwards by trying to EQ this for more bass...because...deep deep is there accurately and maddeningly distant but you'll cloud it by punching up 60 - 250hz stuff.  You'll also affect the overall &#34;slam&#34; to some degree by punching up the bass.<br /><br />SOUNDSTAGE:  Clinical, &#34;Scientific&#34; and Delineated to an almost maddening degree......<br /><br />THE BAD:  Lack of Audio &#34;Comfort Food&#34;<br /><br />  I had seen reviews of various &#34;Studio&#34; type headphones alluding to this and went &#34;Well...what IS your problem OK?  So it's delineated and clear..how can you go wrong???&#34;  Well.... First of all, the clarity of these headphones makes listening to MP3s - especially any Lower bitrate MP3s immediately tedious.  I've never experienced that difference so quickly and it's not necessarily a good thing.  You will hear the that the MP3 audio masking / compression has &#34;dried up&#34; a lot of the studio ambience, reverb, etc.  I've never been forced to notice this until now.<br /><br />  But, lets say for purpose of discussion you are listening to high quality recordings in a good format (CD - Red book audio &#34;WAV&#34; format 16bit 44.1 Khz uncompressed or better like SACD , DVD Audio, HDCD, etc)....<br /><br />  OK groovy.  The sound is all clear, the sound is ALL here, every detail  present and accounted for ...but but...  ---&#62;  you'll feel like a &#34;Scientist&#34; listening to your favorite music with these headphones.  &#60;-----<br /><br />  Again you go &#34;WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM PAL ? !!!!&#34;<br /><br />  I'll tell ya:  There's a part of me that screams out &#34;For God's sake give me  some ,  *  some *  SLOP or even the tiniest bit of SLOP or humanity!  Some integration on the audio canvas, PLEASE!&#34;  Example:  Let's say there are 16 instruments or overlaid tracks on a song -  well...by God you hear each and every one of them happening bass to treble as a DELINEATED instance and ...it can be uncomforting and disconcerting in the way the sound hits your soul.  They all hit your ears in the same time but are not &#34;experienced&#34; by me as integrated and fun / musical.  I feel like a clinician with the microscope listening to music with these.  Imagine the grammar Nazi's designing headphones!  Emily Post with an IQ of 180 designing headphones.  NOTE:  These comments are about audio design- not the &#34;high frequencies&#34; per se.  The high frequency EQ on these headphones are just fine - commendable in fact.<br /><br />IN SHORT:  These headphones are high quality and many things - probably a godsend to an engineer who wants to know every nuance of what's going on but they are NOT Audio &#34;Comfort food&#34;.  There are no mashed potatoes with gramma's best gravy here.  Your audio is delivered by the best scientific audio accounting design team that ever walked the Earth!  You'll laugh and think I'm crazy - but buy these and you'll see!<br /><br />  I hope burn-in will change my opinion on the fun factor on these.  They have made me realize that I don't want to scrutinize my music like an ant farm under a microscope - I want to ENJOY and FEEL my music on an INTEGRATED audio canvas/ soundstage.  There is a difference.  I want the music to hit my heart viscerally - not clinically.<br /><br />  Your mileage may vary - this is just one man's opinion.  I feel they gave a fair product for what they are charging.  Certainly they are not crap or &#34;bad&#34; low quality headphones.  By the way I have a couple of decent separate headphone DAC boxes - no difference.  I do think / speculate that a tube amp could &#34;save&#34; these.  Something that gives a slight blur or wash of even ordered harmonics....integration ....anything....<br /><br />SAVING GRACE:  These phones are good candidates for affordable travel headphones (long plane flight) where you don't want leakage to bug your immediate seat neighbors but also don't want to drop $300.00 for special noise cancelling headphones.<br /><br />I will keep these but I will renew my search for &#34;Audio comfort food&#34;.<br /><br />Other Bright Spots / exceptions to my complaints:  One song that is a revelation on these headphones is &#34;Move Over&#34; by Janis Joplin - these bring the dueling piano and guitar parts into perfect relief.  Traffic &#34;You Can All Join In&#34; very enjoyable in it's clarity.  Also if you ever wondered what someone said or mumbled in the background - you'll hear it with these.<br /><br />P.S. Some perspective:  I tend to listen to old school rock (Beatles, Stones, Clapton, Zep, Floyd, Traffic, Nik Kershaw, Karla Bonoff, Neil Finn, Bowie, Robert Palmer, James Taylor, Mama's and Papa's, etc) and on the flip side Bach, Chopin preludes, Beethoven (symphonic and piano concertos, sonatas) and some jazz(Weather Report, Brubeck, Airto, Guaraldi).  So far my favorite older headphones are the discontinued Koss A-250 closed back headphones.  Those were Koss's one attempt at making audiophile headphones.  They were leaky as hell and had durability issues but were fun and musical to listen to.  Have also owned various mid-level Sennheisers over the years.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's very true to the My Little Pony series and very addictive. You can earn gems easily enough through regular log ins, certain quests, levelling up, tapping Derpy... The one thing that is killing me is the social aspect. It's forced upon you in some areas. There's a bug where I can't invite people, so I can't earn social currency. Which means I can't buy Scootaloo. So I can't complete the quest and advance. Otherwise an awesome game. :)
0805092455|3.0|Love the book, but thought we were getting a hard book; instead got a hard cover book. Our 10 month old son loves to read, but also loves to turn pages and rip paper, so not a book we can allow him to turn pages just yet. I give the book a 5 star rating, but the fact that it wasn't clear that it wasn't a hard book for babies was the disappointment.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is not a \\"zombie\\" book.<br />I am not a zombie aficionado.<br />Frankly, I am not all that into \\"zombie\\" literature.<br /><br />This book is a geopolitical commentary/thriller that just happens to have zombies in it.<br />When I say this, I do not mean to say that zombies are not a big part of the storyline (if one can call this a \\"story\\"). They are, in fact, the major threat being dealt with, but that is simply the vehicle the author has chosen (and if you read any of his past novels you will note the trend in his affinity for this subject matter).<br />It reads like non-fiction.<br /><br />Written much like a documentary, this ambitious masterwork is told from a first person perspective. The people speaking to the reader are survivors being interviewed by the narrator who was asked to compile data.<br />These are survivors of a war that sought to utterly destroy all humanity.<br />To say that this book depicts an attempted genocide would be incorrect as this implies volition and a targeted population.<br />These are the zombies we grew up with.<br />They do not hate. They do not see race, creed or color.<br />They hunger and all they want to do is feed on flesh.<br /><br />The book draws upon so many well done methods to convey its story and messages.<br />We are treated to a fully formed, post-apocalyptic telling of how humanity survived this horror.<br />This includes detailing important battles (Battle of Yonkers, Battle of Hope, etc.) We hear about how the nations of the World first responded to the threat and we travel the globe to do this. We read about how governments sought to cover themselves and how \\"acceptable losses\\" and \\"civilian casualties\\" were among the orders of the day.<br />We read tales of survival and loss.<br />We read tales of breaking and hope.<br /><br />It is as if the war actually took place. This book is that well thought out.<br /><br />Some people have commented that the thrill is taken out of this novel as the outcome is known at the start. I totally disagree with this assessment.<br />This book is entirely engrossing as well as thrilling and I was enrapt, marveling not only at the level of detail and the astounding narrative which calls upon so many different, believable voices, but the creativity that it took for the author to bring this concept to life.<br />Astounding.<br /><br />Also, not to be missed is the mix of both cynicism and optimism. Disdain for politics and government machinations. Faith in some humanity and the hearts in which that humanity might be found.<br />The struggle to do what is \\"right\\" and the confound of making choices deemed \\"immoral\\" for the \\"greater good.\\"<br /><br />You will ask yourself at the end...who was the real enemy here?<br />Zombies...or people.<br /><br />Read this.<br /><br />Namaste~t the start.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I got the impression Brooks wanted to draw the characters together beyond their experience with the war.  Towards the end, it felt forced. The \\"good byes\\" section almost seemed like an afterthought.<br /><br />And finally, I felt as though Brooks wanted to interject his personal feelings about capitalism, politics, and make a societal observation.  I say that's his prerogative, but whereas Mary Shelly was able to weave her stance subtly into Frankenstein...Brooks forced the issue.<br /><br />Maybe this is what I get for reading a zombie book...

There are 1K pages, so you should be a devoted reader and willing to wade through some in-depth background information, but I've found that the background is always relevant.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|You already know that any film series based on comic book characters has to be taken with a grain of salt, so your standards become based on things like - are the characters consistent with how they're portrayed in their individual movies? Do the actors' interpretations measure up to the years of comic book presentation they have to follow? Do you want more when it's all said and done? In this genre, you can honestly. get away with tantalizing hints of 'what's next in the series' - because that's comic book form, eh? So you buy the next one to find out...<br /><br />Avengers was a tall order and it's clear that the producers have been thinking this through since the first Iron Man at least.  Marvel Comic characters are distinct, personable and quirky - and the casting delivers, right down to the supporting characters.<br />It's a little bit of a stretch that all it takes is a serious a**-kicking from friend Black Widow to get Hawkeye's head on straight and back on the side of good (there's probably more on the cutting room floor about that...); all in all, however, it would've been hard to beat the casting anywhere in the film all the same. As an actor, I particularly appreciate moments where the characters are allowed to give in to their personalities - Hulk's straight-arm strike to knock out an annoying fellow Avenger after the last villain is on the ground comes to mind--sibling rivalry in nature? Random act of 'give me space'? Who cares?<br /><br />It's a blast. We loved it. Just grab some popcorn and go for the ride...
B0044XV3R8|5.0|it was breathtaking and amazing the way they covered the story and drew you in to the setting, you believed.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|A masterpiece film, a Bond that you have never seen before. It shows him at his best, and worst, but through it all you find out his loyalty to Queen and country. Bond  can be your best friend, or worst enemy. It is a complete story revealing the skeletons in the closet of M16, and  M. Overall a great movie, and a must see!

0316044695|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is true story by Marcus Luttrell, a former Navy Seal and member of Seal team 10, about his experiences and his team mates on seal team 10 while deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Redwing.  The story takes place in Afghanistan, 2005, on the dangerous mountains near Pakistan and close to Osama bin Laden's home and his Taliban fighters. His purpose of this book was not fame and glory for himself, but for everyone to remember his team mates and friends that didn't make it home alive from this mission. He wanted every American to know his brothers, \\"that is what soldiers call their team mates\\" and not forget them as they gave their lives for your peace and security.<br />In June 2005, Seal Team 10 left their patrol base heading for the Pakistan border on a kill or capture mission deep in the Taliban stronghold territory. Four men were going deep into enemy territory and only 24 hours later one member of that team would still be alive to tell the story of what happened. That one last remaining member was Marcus Luttrell, a leading petty officer in the U.S. navy and member of seal team 10. Lone Survivor is the story of Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the battle fought in the Afghanistan Mountains that ultimately took the lives of his teammates or brothers as we now know.<br />They started their mission like any other that morning in June; they were dropped off by a helicopter near the Hindu-Kush area of Afghanistan. Once they were set up and observing the village, a group of sheep herders wondered upon them merely by accident. The seals had to make a very hard choice decision at that moment, A decision that would be a matter of life or death to many. The decision was what to do with the sheep herders; let them go or simply kill them. If they decided to let them go, there was a chance that the sheep herders would notify the Taliban leaders of their location and if they killed them, then they would be in violation of their rulesof engagement (ROE). They all took a vote and the last person voting was Marcus. His vote was the tie breaker vote that let the sheep herders go and return to their village.<br />A little more than an hour later their position was surrounded by nearly 150 Taliban fighters. A big fire fight broke out that lasted for several hours. The seal managed to kill at least 100 of the Taliban fighters before being overrun. The seals fought a great battle. It was not until a grenade landed close to Marcus that he became separated from his brothers. The grenade blew him down a ravine and away from the enemy. After some confusion and situational awareness gathering, Marcus realized that he had to fall back and get out of the area. He then proceeded to run and eventually he was found upon by some friendly locals from the area, where they helped him and nourished him back to health the best they could. Eventually three of the seals would be killed and only Marcus would survive.<br />Although this book would make Marcus Luttrell ore famous and known to many Americans, he didn't write the book for that reason. His only wish is for the people of America and his fellow brothers at arms is not to forget the men that served with him during the battle and that their legacy live on forever. This book is an outstanding testimony of an up-close and personal view of how our military and especially our special forces are fighting and protecting our lives from abroad. It is the story of men who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Finally, the end of a captivating trilogy. The previous books were better, but this one finished it up neatly. What a tragic love story!

B00013M6NK|5.0|Ordered [2] of these because the price was too hard to beat. Both took full charge and we'll see how they perform. At this point I am very satisfied with my purchase. Shipping took a little longer than I expected but it was not an immediate need so no complaints so far.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|I am a big fan of the Back to the Future trilogy. I have nothing but a warm spot for the first film, which had the perfect element of science fiction, comedy, and heart. I am also in the minority that enjoyed Part II, and loved it's corner into darker territory. I do agree that a little of the heart of the first film was missing in the second, which was why Back to the Future Part III was a worthy conclusion. I also have a soft spot for this entry since it was made the same year (1990) I was born.<br /><br />Warning to Viewers: You will have to see at least the last 15 minutes of Part II to understand what happens in Part III. A bolt of lightning (from the same storm that once helped send him back to 1985) this time hits the DeLorean, transporting Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to Hill Valley in 1885 and stranding Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) in 1955. He has left instructions to Marty of where he has hidden the time machine to be found by him in 1955, how to repair it with help from the 1955 Doc, and use it to drive it back to 1985. He instructs Marty to destroy the time machine when he returns, and to not attempt to get him back. He is happy living as the town blacksmith in a part of time he has always had a fondness for. Marty is prepared to reluctantly respect Doc's wishes until nearby the mine that Doc hid the machine, he finds a gravestone indicating that seven days after writing his letter to Marty, Doc will be shot by Buford \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen (I won't do the formality of telling who whose descendent Mad Dog is) Marty decides to defy Doc's wishes and after he and 1955 Doc repair the machine. Marty travels back to 1885. To cut to the chase, Marty and Doc reunite and after giving Doc the sobering news, they decide to return, but they run into two roadblocks. One is Marty ripping the fuel line when he arrived in 1885 which means they have no gas to get the car up to the 88 MPH necessary to travel back in time.<br /><br />After a few setbacks. They figure out that instead of trying to run it on its own power (or pull it with a team of horses) They figure out the key is to push it (via a locomotive). But they are also hindered by the second roadblock. Doc falls in love with the new local schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) after saving her from being driven off a ravine (once again changing history, she was supposed to be killed on that ravine). Doc's feelings for Clara begin to affect his common sense. Adding further complications to the matter is Marty (or Clint Eastwood as he is calling himself in 1885) getting tangled up with Tannen and a series of events leads to Tannen challenging Marty to a duel on the street on Monday (the same day that they are to \\"borrow\\" the locomotive for their trip back.) As Doc points out it may not be his name that ends up on on that tombstone anymore, but Marty's (Clint) that may.<br /><br />Some critics complained that once Marty travels back to 1885, it becomes a straight forward Western, with very less time travel than the continuous time travel that took place in Part II. If you recall. In the original, there was not that much time travel, and almost the same amount of time in the film took place in 1950s as this film takes place in the 1880s. Both films also maintain a sense of humor of Marty and Doc (especially Marty) place in a time period different from their own and struggling to fit in. For example, Doc talking to Clara about the thrill of reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea as a boy and being inspired to devote his life to science, and Clara laughs revealing that the book had only been written 10 years before. As I said before, this third chapter retains a lot of the heart that marked the first film. For example, perhaps feeling that they have gone as far as they could go with the saga of Marty and the McFly family (Marty's father being murdered, Biff marrying his mother and treating her like a dog.) This film takes a different approach and gives most of the story over toDoc Brown. Lloyd is all up to the challenge, portraying Doc's pain at seeing what he once saw as his greatest creation become his greatest regret. \\"I wish I had never invented that infernal time machine\\", he says at one point, \\"it's caused nothing but disaster\\", and of course, his passion at finding love for possibly the first time with Clara (it helps that Steenburgen is just right for the role, just the sweet innocence that you could believe that anybody would have no choice but fall in love with her.)<br /><br />The film shifting focus to Doc does not take away Marty's importance to the story. A carryover subplot from Part II is Marty's lack of control when someone challenges his manhood and calls him \\"chicken\\". Doc warns Marty that may lead to an important and dark turning point in his life back in the present day (and based on what we see of future Marty in Part II). Marty's confrontation with Tannen is in a way Marty confronting his greatest fears and this time, it is not so much his future on the line, but how he chooses to live his life and see himself, and that is something no amount of time travel can fix for him.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had almost all of the characters; even bought double coin; had 60 hoverboards: the. I got on this morning and nothing I had nothing! no characters no coins almost no hoverboards and my high score it was 0 it used to be 759674 and now it is all gone I am going to give a complaint!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the new minecraft update helps make it feel like the xbox or pc version. it has armor, new blocks, baby animals, and more. i enjoy the creativity and strategy in this game.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|GOT  THIS CD FOR THE SONG KNEE DEEP. GOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT, LOVE THIS CD. YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE. WOULD RECOMMEND
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This is a good movie of the Harry Potter series. This is well directed and great acting. This is a must have for Harry Potter fans.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good plot twists and a pretty twisted plot!  Definitely an enjoyable, compelling read. My first novel by Flynn and I'll likely read more.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love the game but it wont let me get on it anymore I got really far and it kept force closing by itself before it even let me in the game
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Movie wasn't that entertaining for me and my wife but it was ok and the kids enjoyed it so it'll get a 4 star.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Not the best one of the RE series, but if you're a fan you have to watch it. It's fun power chick entertainment. Don't expect more than that and you'll enjoy it for what it is; just get your popcorn, darken the room, and watch the sci-horror zombie fun unfold.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 5 year old child plays this game and loves it. The only problem is,  she is not an independent reader and has to have much of the game read to her. We would prefer some voice instructions.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read an abridged version of this book as a young teenager and read this version on my Kindle after taking my daughter to see the film, mainly to fill in the holes in the plot.<br /><br />The book is a revelation and a joy. The translation is both excellent and lyrical, one does not have the feeling one is reading a translation.<br /><br />The topics dealt with in the digressions are as relevant today as they were when they were written.  Hugo's views on women and children are particularly thought provoking in light of the One Billion Rising campaign and our ever increasing knowledge of the abuse and mis-use of children.<br /><br />The in-built dictionaries on the Kindle proved a boon when dealing with some archaic words as did direct access to Wikipedia for background on some of the more obscure characters from French history.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the books size, all the chapters are fairly short and this makes reading it very manageable.  Yes it will take you a few week to read it; it will be with regret that you will come to the end.
0393343405|5.0|Greenblatt is a great Shakespearean guru. He is knowledgeable and never boring, albeit at times tedious to &#34;bite through.&#34; If you are going on a 2 week holiday with your best bookworm friend, take along a copy...
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Popped my popcorn, got myself securely in my comfy chair all ready to view what I thought would be another exciting James Bond thriller.  NOT!  What a disappointment.  What a  rip off and waste of time and money.  Guess days are now goneby for a good James Bond and thriller movie..  Hollywood is just not worth the time and money anymore for a good movie.  Wasting time and money...back to readying a good book!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|being admired by this movie sequel is like watching lord of the rings. after you get into the first one, you just not satisfied until you get a full dose of it. definitely worth the money for all of them that I've purchased including the LOR collection. wouldn't dare part with it.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I just wanted a simple case for our Kindle Fire so it was protected while traveling. This case works great and was a great price.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This app is really awesome! I love games like this! I have enchanted paintings and outher games like that!! It's a good game for seek and find people!!!! Got to go finish the game!!!
B002M9WW30|2.0|I bought this expecting a great product,but I was wrong...<br />I'm a big fan of this kind of movies, this set includes 7 disk.For my surprise 3 of then doesn't work.<br />Rocky 1,2,3 and the bonus disk work great.<br />Rocky 4,Rocky 5 and Rocky Balboa this 3 disk are damaged, I am very disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />I'm from Costa Rica and return the product is a little expensive

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Mr. Mattel provides a fascinating adventure story about survival laced with biology, psychological insight, spirituality, personal courage and endurance. I could not put it down.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|have always been a fan of harry potter. found it to be very entertaining with the visual effects that just keep you coming back for more. came to own all of them from the very first one. can't get enough of him. magnificent move collection
B004WR125O|3.0|good value and price and functions as it should...allows the receiver to stream from itunes on computer, there oare two usb ports so this can be in the one on the rear of unit
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game is more like me I can get new animals and with llost giving them food is not like doung boring things.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This was a story of a town. It had a couple minor climactic points, but the ending was not satisfying for me. Can't say as I would recommend this book.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This item arrived quickly & will be a great addition to my movie collection. Glad I could purchase a VHS.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like the way it works, it is very easy to use.  Use daily. It beats me most of the time.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|have always been a lover of the transformers ever since the childhood days. followed it from the very first movie that was created.  great sound effects along with visual. went to see all of them at the theatre & then decided that I wish to own. even became a fan of the soundtrack. non stop action.
B0001BDAQO|4.0|Buena grabación y buena orquesta para disfrutar a fondo del compositor.Disco en buen estado y envío muy rápido.Muy recomendable. Volveré a comprar otra vez..
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|This is such a great new album stoked when I heard it. I Love this band. Send beats sounds a little r  n b but vocals r great as usual
B0063IH60K|5.0|Clean graphics that are easy to view, functions perfect, true to the game with no weird fluff unnecessarily added. Fun game to pass the time with.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|If you give this 1 star your a nut. This is litterly the most addicting game i have ever played. Here are some pros(good things) and some cons(bad things)<br />Pros<br />1:Keeps you thinking and busy.<br />2:Strategic skills are needed<br />3:Contracts are out to pay bills if needed<br /><br />Cons<br />1:Lacks a 100% filled game learning program<br />2: Little strange messed up system - once when i played at the awards the game that was the worst also got the award for the best...and i had made 3 games that where in it that round.<br /><br />Overall well rounded game and needs no updates i would give it a 9/10 on this game if i tested it. :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment, but it's probably my fault because I didn't read the negative reviews before I bought it. It was entirely too dark for me, and it left me wondering who thinks of this stuff?  The characters and the plot were completely depressing! It definitely taught me to read both good and bad reviews before hitting the buy button on my kindle.
B001974DG0|5.0|This story had me in turns holding my breath in fearful anticipation, smiling & tearing up with the feelings it so strongly evoked. If pressed to describe the story I would I adequately use words like brilliant, hopeful, chilling & amusing. One of the best stories I've read.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've enjoyed this version for my Kindle Fire while on long trips. It is a relaxing diversion with good visual qualities.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|mp3 is great for music, I use no other because everyone is using this now and you don't even have to go to the music store anymore especaily the mall, aweful prices, I don't buy cds anymore just download mp3s easy and quick and great. I buy all my mp3's here on amazon. no other place!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is great for when your sitting around doing nothing and you need something to do. It is fun.
1616960922|4.0|Cute idea great read for young people. Like the premise. Very interesting. Quick read would like to have story expanded
630521610X|4.0|I had this but  misplaced the DVD. was happy to be able to get it again now i have all  of them.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I started to read it and as usual, the beginning was pretty slow. But when things started to heat up, boy did they heat up! I have never read a book that has made me ask so many questions and have so many 'what if' scenarios. Stephen King did a great job illustrating how 1958 would have looked and felt. I was hoping the ending would of been different, but overall, it had me glued to my Kindle for about a week.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like this app as it presents everything including moving graphics in one view and so far it's been accurate enough that a quick look in the morning lets you know how to dress and prepare for your day! :)
B008JF8O9M|2.0|printer share is better if you have a tablet, can print anywhere, but this did not work for me.  sorry
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I have a really bad addiction to this show! I just started watching the show on the CW in the fourth season so I had a lot of catching up to do. I watched all three seasons in one week! I love this show!
0756405890|5.0|This book reignited my interest in reading...Yes it was that good!  Some have stated that it is too lengthy, well it is long but it's really about the journey not the destination.  I found myself wishing it was longer.  Full disclosure, I listened to the audible version (which I recommend as the narrator is excellent) and actually started to look forward to my commute to work.  I even found myself taking the long way to work several days, just to get some additional listening time.  I don't really want to get into the synopsis of the book as that is covered elsewhere, but I just felt that others need to know how enjoyable this book is!  Well developed characters, vivid descriptions, humor, action - this book has it all!
0307454568|5.0|a friend told me how AMAZING these books where and she said thqt i would really like them. She was SO right i LOVED them ALL !!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app serves it's purpose I suppose, but friend's comments and likes don't always show up in my notifications, and when they do, they're really delayed. You've got the WiFi anyway. Skip the app and just go to the web.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I thought it was amazing like the first on. You never knew what was going to happen next
B0055S348W|5.0|Works great, had to buy this! used to be free but oh well, needed this, only one that works great wireless from tablet to print for android, and you will agree this prints web pages documents and much more. get this one. is best for android
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! It was funny and had lots of romance. I don't know what I would do in this same situation, but I'm glad everything worked out!
B008NA3I30|5.0|This move really resonated with me as it is a must-see movie for people in their late 20-s to early 30's. If you have been in a long-term relationship and things started getting dull, then you'll understand this movie. I see a lot of negative reviews with valid points of views that I actually also agree with. This movie is painfully slow paced and the dialogue at times is a bit confusing. You have to understand the back story that the director is trying to imply (I had to watch this movie 3 times). Not that because I was frustrated but I wanted to understand the depth of each character's innermost feelings.<br /><br />The most splendid acting I have seen was from the first scene of the movie where Michelle Williams captured the audience with her beauty and just simple acting. I thought to myself this I ought to see, the expressions in her face and not a word was said. This to me is good acting :)<br /><br />I loved the playful banters between her and her potential new lover, and the restraint they take to maintain their moral values. It may seem like a fantasy movie to some audiences and even find it unrealistic, but you will be surprised how many young wives go through the exact same scenarios in their head. Stability with a lovable man or an exciting new lover because she married so young. This is a question we all ask ourselves, \\"Can you have your cake and eat it too?\\"<br /><br />Sarah Silverman is surprisingly NOT FUNNY in this movie but hubby and I liked her character.<br /><br />Hubby thought this movie was absolutely ridiculous, I told him this, \\"Honey, this Valentine's day, you better come up with something good.\\" LOL!<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy real movies without cliches, then you will like this.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|It's a fun game. I'm playing it on the Kindle Fire HD, and have had no problems with force closes, and the game plays extremely smoothly. The controls are very responsive. It starts out very easy, and does (as other reviews have alluded to) get difficult. It never gets impossible though, and for long term value I'd rather it did get difficult instead of just have different levels that are easily passed.<br /><br />The big question I had about this game was going to be the presentation. I wondered if it looked professional. It does. The graphics, while black and white and nothing amazing, are good. The game has a stylish look to it, and it is has a similar look to World of Goo. The menu's look good (between levels), the fish and on screen graphics all look good, they have a nice glow look to them that is brighter than the pictures represent.<br /><br />The game does have varied tasks for the levels, such as capture a number of air bubbles while avoiding pollution, survive the pollution for a number of seconds, capture so many air bubbles in a certain amount of time, exc. It does a good job of mixing tasks up so that you aren't doing the same thing over and over.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good game that you should definitely pick up as the app of the day, and it's a game that is worth 0.99 cents for someone who is looking to pass time with a stylish, fun, tilt based sensory game.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Sound City, as well as one I just saw at Sundance, \\"Twenty Feet from Stardom\\" helped me realize what most of today's music is missing-the human element.  My favorite bands to this day were my parent's favorite bands-The Beatles, ABBA, Rolling Stones, Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, etc  They all have that melding of sounds and harmonies that's not perfect but really makes you feel a song and be moved by it.<br /><br />It'd be great to see some of folk rock bands like Mumford & Sons, Lumineers, and the Head and the Heart, record in Studio 606.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this just in time for the release of the movie and I'm excited to see how it plays out on the big screen. I really enjoyed the love story. It was a very emotional read for me.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The producers came very close to the book in this one!  I hope they do as well with the next 2.
B00338QENI|5.0|I enjoyed learning about the people behind HeLa cells. I appreciated the family's pride and hurt feelings about what happened to Henrietta Lacks.<br /><br />It was difficult for me to put the book down each day when I had to return to work.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Wonderfully written. Uncomfortable to read at first due to the narrator's scattered mind but it quickly catches you and won't let go.
B004OZZ624|5.0|There was suspense and little twists throughout the movie. Worth the watch from start to finish. Kept you interested the entire time.
B0011Z1BQK|5.0|Another direction for Zeppelin to go in and another great album. Got this ablim to complete my Led Zeppelin collection.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The movie was fine when we could watch it.  The download was terrible and with 45 minutes left in the movie we completely lost it and had to go back to get it to resume.  I'm not pleased with the service. and would like our account credited for the money wasted on this download.  We use Netflix and don't have any problems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a wonderful app,I love it so much,I Don't know what else I can say about other than that it is just so awesome
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this show and I'm so happy to own the 1st season of this creative masterpiece!  Amazing and so happy to have it at my disposal so that I can view it whenever I want- repeatedly!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Try playing temple run 2 first so this seems easy. But still really good game always remember to jump after sliding on double slide.
030758836X|5.0|I love a story, be it a movie, novel or short story that reels me in.  I like to be introduced to the characters that i  don't have to like,just be interested in.  This novel delivers.  I was drawn in, wondered what was going on and what would happen.  I was not dissappointed.  It is a very original mystery and psycholigical drama with a twist.  That is all I am going to say.  I simply bought the book because it was a best seller that i knew very little about.  It was worth reading. I was throughly entertained, mystified and surprised.  I got what I love in a story.
B001NTZDMC|5.0|STYX, I still love there music as much now as I did when it 1st came out.  There still a great band.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Great Movie!  I only wish they had more DVD extras.  But so glad we purchased it - will watch it often.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book! I will read this book again and recommend it to others. It gives you a great perspective on life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE! It is a must read and I would definitely recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great I have a tip though even though Redstone isn't mineable check around it and all ways dig out dirt under ground also leads to diamond's here is a seed that is so epic it is my name only no spaces and s and g are capital like this<br />  SoniGiovanni.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is a great read! The culture, the classes, the horrors of the orphanage-all so real and gripping. Raw, real emotion well presented. I did not want it to end!
B0011Z1BTW|5.0|This was a great album and it made a great movie. This was and still is the best group ever.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It is a real pity that Disney mis-marketed this film, as it had the potential to kick start  a whole new franchise.<br />As a fan of the books, I had been looking forward to the film adaptation for a long time, and thoroughly enjoyed myself in the theater - even more so when I watched the film again on this stunning bluray set.<br />The image is gorgeous, the sound design lush and encompassing, and the special features are fascinating.<br /><br />Buy it, watch it!
0545101417|1.0|I kid you not the cd worked perfectly until the last chapter. Half way through it just stopped. Shipping was fast but the cd didn't work correctly.
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|I really liked the first movie, and I was really excited when I heard there was a second one. But this was so dissapointing. The film has no story, and it's just attractive because of the special effects. I think the fans of the videogames will love this one, but for me (I have only seen the films), it was very dissapointing.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Like most viewers I have been delighted by this series. So I won 't repeat all that has been said. I watched it on CBS when it aired (thank you CBS for the quality you put on air, what a change from other stations!) but the advantage with a DVD is that you can rewind when you missed some of the dialogue. As I am french speaking from Canada, sometimes some of it escapes me. And there are also the subtitles who help a lot. I have also bought season 3, and of course I am anxious to see season 4, hoping that it will be just as good as the previous ones.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Saw Wicked for the first time this year and loved it.  That's the reason I bought this CD.  Playing the music over and over as I have done takes me back to that night. Really happy with this purchase.
B0011Z9360|5.0|They were so good at trying different style's of music and exploring different way's to play. They will always the kings of rock.
B004RE2J7W|3.0|I did not know this CD was in another language - not English.  It took me awhile to figure out how to watch the CD in English.  Instructions were included with the CD but it took awhie to figure it out.  I wish I had known to this before I purchased it. I am still new to ordering from Amazon.  I just want to pop it in and watch it.  I will likely order another CD in English this time if I can find it.  This was probably my fault<br />because as I said I am new to buying from Amazon.  I did not know that some items come from individual sellers and not from Amazon.<br /><br />The CD was packaged okay.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|The video part stop working for me. But the camera take great pics I Love using this app but may have to buy a video recorder app
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I find this gane very relaxing and at times challenging to play.  I look forward to more games like this from the developer. Keep up the good work.
B004EPZ084|4.0|I completely missed this in the theaters and am glad I gave it a chance. The previews didn't do this movie any justice. You get the Arrested Development/Michael Bluth character from Jason Bateman, you get the hyper spazzy It's Always Sunny/Charlie character from Charlie Day, and you get the SNL flavor from Jason Sudeikis. Just with more swearing. The comedic trio works, and this movie was well-executed. The supporting cast is fantastic too, highlighted by Jamie Foxx's MF'er Jones. This was one of the better comedies to come out in the last few years.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I stopped reading Clancy probably 10 yrs ago because he technically writes so much and uses a lot of military acronyms I can't remember.  This book brought me back to falling in love with him all over again.  Since, I have read 7 more Clancy novels.  This one is a great read and moves right along.  Buy it and enjoy!  It's worth every penny per word!
B009E3EY38|5.0|It's the next best thing to being at Led Zeppelin's last concert. It was amazing to listen to this concert.<br />I wish I coud have been there.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I think that the game is  cool also I love tennis games. I wish I can rate it 20 starts
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book had many twists and turns with helped maintain my interest. As a parent the story is relatable if heaven forbid I was in a similar position . A perfect book for book clubs because the book lends itself to much discussion
B0054R6BFM|3.0|In a collection of thirteen audio recordings, a teen outsider explains thirteen interwoven reasons for her choice to commit suicide. Each, more or less, originated with one or more one of her peers.<br /><br />I'm heartened that teens are reading far and wide a book that's meant to encourage people to considered unintended consequences of their actions. Yet, despite that, I can't recommend this book for its heart or because it touched me emotionally; although I would recommend it, that recommendation springs from its fast pacing and the introspection it will almost certainly inspire.<br /><br />The dead protagonist's actions, in the end, were at least as harsh and detrimental--to many--as were the actions she used to justify her final conclusion. It was extremely hard for me to relate to her, straight up until the last 10-15% of the book. I had the same problem with the living protagonist. I could hear his thoughts, but despite his many references to his feelings, I wasn't moved to feel even a single one of them. This might have been because of how quickly perspective cycled between the two protagonists, but I feel like there's more to it than that.<br /><br />Again, I would recommend this book as a quick and thought-provoking read, but I would do so with reservations for anyone looking to truly connect with characters. 3.5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is really fun, but doesn't always load and sometimes lag. I wish you could control camera angles a little more.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love any bubble game! This is fun! It gives you more levels to complete so you have a variety of levels and ways of doing things.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This album is great. We listen to it all the time. It's really on of the best soundtracks to a movie.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was much better than the first book in the series. Ethan and Lena's relationship still annoys me because it seems so contrived and forced. The story overall is good, and the ending manages to put a nice stop to the story and still leave you wanting to read the next one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great,  I've played it far more than I ever played the first one. I really enjoy the new features and challenges.
034553056X|5.0|As usual Grisham always delivers. My only problem with his books is that he can't write as fast as I can read.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case was ok as far as water proof. But for the all out no the cover over where you plug<br />It in broke within the first two weeks. So now it would no longer be water proof!!<br />Therefor the case is no good for holding up. The money I spent on the case I would have<br />Expected it to last longer in all parts. I bought the case for my granddaughter  she is now<br /> Back to her old rubber case. It should be made strong all around this should include the<br />Plug area. So no I'm not happy with it at all!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game,  slightly scary and always evolving. My only wish is that it was longer, I beat it in 3 hours. Still enjoyable.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|Loved this movie. It has some very wild fantasy dreams and shows that dreams can be very powerful. This movie was given some bad reviews, but I thought it very good. It was very different, one of a kind.
B009MF56GC|5.0|great deal & service, would be a returning customer. would tell friends love shopping here. is the best way to
B0077ATSU4|5.0|It is a heartbreaking account of the coping in a world with the tragedy of 911 that is very sweet,sad , and touching in the way it is told by a little boy who has Asbergers syndrome . It shows life as a family copes with a reality of a loving Father who was this child's world. He was meant to have been an extraordinary teacher and mentor to son's growth. There are so many wonderful subplots going on as in life.It's amazing acting and very touching acting by all the actors. The key he finds leads him into a need to solve it's mystery that takes him all over New York and occupies him as he begins to learn about people more than more adults ever learn. That life is a mystery locked and we must find a key that makes the time passing meaningful. To think that every family is experiencing this kind of trauma was the hardest part for me to grasp. I don't know if it would be therapuetic to the children of 9/11, but it will help those of us who watch it never to forget  9/11 . There are people who will love this movie and the story it tells.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|The Camel Club has been so entertaining. I find it hard to put the books down even when I know I should be sleeping. I would love to meet the man who can be so convincing that you forget that it is fiction.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|It is perfect. The ability to read and view item in either portrait or landscape is fanstatic. This item is far and above my expectations. A great product.
0060191325|4.0|No one should seek out serious relationships until they have read this book (and preferably a few more... His Needs, Her Needs, Love & Respect, Five Love Languages).<br /><br />Thanks to books like this I have been in a strong perpetually satisfying relationship for over 10 years, 6 years of which have been a powerfully encouraging marriage.<br /><br />Take the time to invest in this book, and one more every year, and you will never regret it and ever be glad you did!
B0011Z1BSS|5.0|This album again shows that Led Zeppelin can make any kind of music. Everything they do is great. Rock's reatest band.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Everything Pink teaches us about sales apples to politics in today's world. People today are often times more informed than the people making the decisions. Pink provides a guide for transforming citizens into collaborators creating vibrant communities.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I loved Leps Worlds, 1 and. it was a such a treat to see a new one. It is so addictive and fun to play.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and comparing to the movie we all have seen hundreds of times. This is a very &#34;easy&#34; read. Someone should remake the movie that is true to the original story.
B000002V1D|5.0|Item arrived quickly from seller.  Great CD with the strongest tracks being &#34;Ordinary World,&#34; &#34;Too Much Information,&#34; and &#34;Come Undone.&#34;  Most of the other tracks are very good as well, but I had to listen to the CD a few times before they grew on me.  This was due to my preconceived notions of Duran Duran based upon their earlier albums.

B0065AR71E|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this. It has helped me play The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. It's the best game guide I've ever owned. The access code for the online Skyrim World Map just adds to the value of my purchase. It was worth more than what I paid for it.<br />Thanks.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh is one of the best out there. Not only as a member of the Eagles, but also on his own. This cd proves how good he is.Would recommend to others.
B00B47NO2O|5.0|Amazing show!!  My husband and I love watching it and can't wait each week to see the next one.  It is a dark TV show, but wonderfully written.  It is predictable at times, but overall fantastic.

030758836X|5.0|This book is so full of surprises that it keeps you glued to the pages. Very clever writer. I was very grateful to Amazon for shipping it so quickly so that I could get the book and start reading as soon as my book club chose it as our book of the month.
1878424319|5.0|This book is really good! Really enlightening and pleasant to read. Once you start you cannot stop. If you are considering buying this book, definitely get it!!
0618918248|3.0|I only rate this book as ok because I am a christian. He is very intelligent and his points and aim are clear. I appreciate knowing his views. Many of his thoughts will encourage a commited christian to evaluate and possibly expand their earlier understandings. If christian, approach only with thick skin.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies, Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.<br /><br />The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever (it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one), we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined, a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.<br /><br />What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula inside-out. While there is an element of globetrotting, and exotic locales are definitely featured, much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And, without giving too much away, the movie's finale is set-up as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.<br /><br />This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up (it is a Bond movie after all). But when they do, we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe, when things go wrong, M is called to testify before a committee hearing.<br /><br />The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films, he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out, he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job, but we also dig deeper into his back-story than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series, then Skyfall completes the Bond \\"origin story\\". In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.<br /><br />Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination, but rather, revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide, the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie: two great actors going head-to-head.<br /><br />There are also Bond girls, naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory woman-with-a-tragic-past. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty, principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a non-romantic way, she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.<br /><br />Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond, then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits, \\"James Bond Will Return\\".mpletes the Bond \\"origin story\\". In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.<br /><br />Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|I had high hopes of enjoying this book but it was very disappointing, it could have been great with a better writer telling the story, it had plenty of scope to be a really good edge of your seat book, but it was predictable, and silly in places, don't waste your money on this one , a thriller with a good ending it is not
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome I am totally addicted I can't stop playing totally worth downloading deffinately reccommend it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is Awesome. I'm only 11 but I know a lot about technology. its easy but hard to make a sequel to a game and these people have done it.  they've made an AWESOMEsequel
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the film numerous times, I was driven to read this first installment, and was blown away. Very well done and cannot wait to continue the series.
B0009K8L5W|5.0|This brings me back to the days of Siempre Domingo and Sabado Gigante where the big appearance was Shakira ! as a 12 year old I was so excited to hear her sing and see her with her black hair and just rock out and sing to her music.  The simpler days where music was the main concern in life ! Even the family siting together to watch Shakira on Siempre Domingo !
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Fun games of chess.  Games Don't take long so time is not a problem to get in a whole game.  Also has good graphics.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|Even though I am not British, I watched the British X-Factor and was pleasently surprised when \\"Little Mix\\" won. \\"Cannonball\\" was great, but would the entire album be as good as their first song? The answer is: YES!<br /><br />Here is my opinion on the individual tracks:<br /><br />1. Wings: What a song! Great voices, great lyrics, great rhythm... just great! 10/10<br /><br />2. DNA: I love this song, the lyrics, the music and the \\"chorale singing\\". 10/10<br /><br />3. Change Your Life: At first it reminded me a bit of Never ever\\" from All Saints. Pop song, easy-going, very melodic, confidence booster. 7/10<br /><br />4. Always Be Together: The first ballad on this album. Nice, but not my favorite. 5/10<br /><br />5. Stereo Soldier: Dance track with Latin elements 6/10<br /><br />6. Pretend It's OK: Rather quiet, but very melodic and I fell in love with this song immediately. 10/10<br /><br />7. Turn Your Face: Beautiful ballad, great voices, the more I listen to it, the better it gets. 10/10<br /><br />8. We Are Who We Are: Another confidence booster. 06/10<br /><br />9. How Ya Doin'?: Uses a sample of Curiosity Killed the Cat's Name and number\\". 07/10<br /><br />10. Red Planet feat. T-Boz: This song is sooo cool. The more I listen to it, the better it gets. Kind of oriental. 10/10<br /><br />11. Going Nowhere: A bit of Flamenco. Song about a woman who is not happy with her boyfriend. Pop meets rap. 07/10<br /><br />12. Madhouse: Crazy song, makes you feel like a patient in a madhouse. 08/10<br /><br />13. Love Drunk: Fast song. A bit of rap, a bit of pop. Gets better and better. 08/10<br /><br />14. Make You Believe: At first it was my least favorite song on this album, but the more you listen to it, the better it gets... 07/10<br /><br />15. Case Closed: Beautiful ballad. 07/10<br /><br />16. DNA: Unplugged Version. I love their voices, but prefer the fast version. 09/10<br /><br />Although not all songs have received 8 or more points from me, I am absolutely thrilled by the diversity of Little Mix and am very much looking forward to future CDs.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Cool game with great graphics and sound.  Controls are easy to learn and very responsive.  Diablo fans need to check it out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this game is so much fun. It doesn't have the best of graphics but it is still fun. I totaly recommend this game for people that are creative and like to kill but without the blood and Gore.  I have played this game on my xbox and on my computer. Its so fun on both of them.  If you are debating wether to get this game I would say get it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. I have been so caught up in playing this game that I have lost track of time and tend to run late. The graphics are great, no issues, and it always seems to work.
B0087EVHVW|4.0|Runs fast, don't cost much. Superior build. Even the stock cooler isn't too bad (still about 20 degrees hotter than my Coolermaster CPU cooler on my other one with same processor, but it's free :-)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game, I don't like the fact if doesn't let you know that it's a trial version until you play through it and it asks you to pay to finish the game
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Christina, but I'm trying to be as objective as I can. \\"Bionic\\" was a flop, I bought it and I like it but I must admit that just few songs were really great or simply good, some were meaningless and some were horrible!!! This is a totally new Christina (with a new team of producers) so forget what you heard in \\"Bionic\\" and, even if \\"Lotus\\" has nothing comparable to \\"Stripped\\" and \\"Back To Basics\\" (I love that 2!) you'll love it. Don't play just once! Each time you'll discover new songs you will love! Songs like \\"Army Of me\\" or \\"Let There Be Love\\" will make you dance with their catchy tunes or power ballads like \\"Just A fool\\" will thrill you! Sales of this album are really poor and lower than \\"Bionic\\", people are probably conditioned, but this is a really good album and the real return of one of the greatest voice of the last decade!

B008O9V4C2|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our daughter.  She is a Donald Fagan/Steely Dan fan.  She thinks this is a great album.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is my first Amazon Instant Video review and purchase and I must say I am a satisfied customer. The process to view and stream the video was easy (maybe too easy?) and effortless. I rarely watch movies twice so I was happy to have the option to rent. Now to the movie review:<br /><br />This is a very, very, very good movie. I had no idea what it was about only that Morgan Freeman was in it. Overall the movie is based on a simple premise: hope. Without giving anything away, the movie literally pulls the viewer in and doesn't let go. The movie is almost 2 1/2 hours, but honestly, you'll never notice. The acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is phenomenal. Their chemistry on the screen seems effortless. Seriously, I forgot I was watching a movie, and instead felt like I was within the story itself. The storyline is well done and is written based on a novel by Stephen King (who knew?!). This is one of those movies you willingly watch over and over again, on purpose. It's a darn good movie. 5/5 stars!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I loved it. The music was great and I have to get the soundtrack now. The movie brings to life the books stars and you can feel them grow together and its a movie that really showed my own childhood at that same stage in my life.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Sometimes newer is not better. Sometimes 'growning & evolving' is nothing but mutating for mutation sake.  Remember when the Superbowl was only about FOOTBALL? Now its about the Superbowl commercials with Football as the 'hook' to keep you watching. Its the same with 'BOND GIRLS'. Once upon a time, 'BOND GIRLS' were only eye candy to the plot (on a par with Q's MI4's 'gagets').  With the last Pierce Brosnan outting, the Bond girl was the movie!!! Quick, name the Bond Movie which almost sank the series? EASY!!! That was the DUO (NO LIE!!!) of James Bond (MI6) and CIA agent (yeah, right) Halle Berry!!! Halle Berry was so wrong for the movie and they made it worse by giving her HALF the screen time!!! Worse, was the most miserable dreck of a Bond score ever to be featured in a BOND MOVIE---Madonna's Trip-Hop jungle beat.  It was the most wretched Bond film I have ever seen and I was around when Dr. No was released in 1962!!!<br /><br />Everything worked in this film. The soundtrack with Adel was straight Neo-Shirly Bassie---all retro silky jazz!!!  Second, the pacing was good and the story absorbing. Third, the selected Bond Girl was a long legged Eurasian villianess---the scenes she were posed in were absolutely ravenous. WIthout giving away the plot (I hate people doing it), pay special attention to the final three minutes of the film.  No, its not a plot twist or anything special---but it is significant...it was like this film itself, a deliberate attempt to return to the intent of the old James Bond---the old Scene Connery of the 60s.<br /><br />Why do people adore/identify with JAMES BOND (of the 60s). First, he's good at what he does (completing missions). Second, he is cold and detached and 100% focused. When you are in a crisis situation, you got to remind COOL, CALM & Collected. Remember that family whose accellorator stuck and the car was going 130mph around curves. Everyone was Screaming for Jesus to help them when all they had to do was T-U-R-N off the ignition!!! They all died because they paniced). Third, he's a killing machine---he's strangle you and then go out for ice cream, no big (License to Kill like Seal Team 06 had with Osama Bin Laden). Fourth, he's an adrenelan junky---he gets off being in the middle of things (DeathWish thing). Fifth, he is totally expendable. Yes, he drives F40 Ferraris and gambles $1 million at Baccrat but he has no friends, no family and no possessions---he's like a ninja. You know he won't be fishing in retirement.  Two days after he's walked out, he'll go home to his apartment & shoot himself.  We LIVE through James Bond. We envy his toys, his women playmates, his coolness and his professionalism. He's Macho in a world where the concept of honour, duty country and things male are simply viewed as 'an inside joke'.  Dr. No, To Russia w/ Love, Goldfinger, You only live Twice, Diamonds are forever, The Pierce Brosnan one where the women are smashing Lenin statutes in a grave yard and this one are the only Bond Keepers (Rodger Moore films were too campy to watch).  My only complaint is that they RECYCLED THE ENTIRE PLOT (remember the Pierse Brosnan one with the Chetchen Agent---that one!!!).  I don't care, I liked 'the remake' a lot!!! I know I'm buying my Blu Ray copy!!!  I'm just saying, you needed to see this at the IMAX with a fine Bourbon or Scotch in your hand prior to the curtin going up.  Me, I wish they did another Layer Cake (the pre-quell). Enjoy

B007NZDES0|5.0|Originally saw the concert footage on Palladium.  Since Sade is a  favorite of mine, I went right to Amazon and ordered this DVD/CD.  It is a bit disappointing that all of the songs from the DVD are not on the CD.  The sound quality is excellent on both the DVD and CD.  Some &#34;live&#34; recordings can disappoint but this one does not at all.
B008X9Z4I8|3.0|The case looks fine and fits the Kindle. However, the first time I tried to zip it shut, one of the zippers stuck a few inches up and will not move past that spot now. Fortunately, the other zipper works fine and keeps the sleeve closed.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|While I'd known of Steve Hackett since the '70's, I'd never heard any of his solo stuff.  I bought this based on reviews I read on Amazon, and I'm glad I did!  It's awesome!  It encompasses many styles and moods, and I've listened to it several times.  I highly recommend it!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|********************MINOR SPOILERS**************************<br /><br />I LOVED this book!! Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire is the equivalent of crack cocaine! I could not put it down, I got the shakes, I experienced some sky-highs some hellish lows, and it ruined several nights of sleep. This book turned my life into a chaotic mess... and I loved every second of it! The characters were enthralling and the story was spellbinding.<br /><br />The story begins at Eastern University with college freshmen Abby Abernathy, her feisty best friend America, and America's sweet boyfriend Shepley attending an underground fight club, called The Circle, run by a guy named Adam. The Circle is held in different basements on the Eastern U campus where bets are placed and big money is won.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's blossoming relationship is captivating. Once Abby lets her guard down and befriends Travis the story takes on a beautiful emotional element that's quite moving. She understands him and he can be the himself around her. They may argue, but ultimately they have each other's backs. Through friendship, Travis has found a place in Abby's heart and she doesn't even know it.<br /><br />Watching Travis attempt to fight his attraction to Abby is mesmerizing. He earnestly tries to let her do what she wants (and date who she wants), but he can't quite let her go. There is an extraordinary push and pull between these two. It starts out as friendship, and even sort of stays in the friendship realm mostly out of stubbornness, yet there is always something more going on. Add to that the dark layers of fear, jealousy, danger, and co-dependency... this book is a revelation!

1423101499|5.0|I've been reading my sons Percy Jackson and the Olympians and we just finished the Battle of the Labyrinth which is the fourth in the series. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a series that follows the title character Percy from the time he is age 12 and finds out that he is a half-blood, or demi-god (kids who have one mortal parent and one immortal parent). The series is set in modern day America and because the Olympians follow the spirit of the west, all of what was described to be set in ancient Greece now resides in North America, and mostly in the United States. Percy is the son of Poseidon and along with his two best friends Grover the satyr and Annabeth daughter of Athena, and his half-brother the Cyclops Tyson, go on many adventures. In the battle of the Labyrinth, Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson delve into labyrinth which over the millennia has grown into a monstrous maze designed to deceive you and get you hopelessly lost. The party of friends goes into the labyrinth hoping to find its creator Daedalus and convince him not to help their enemy Kronos (a Titan god who is resurrecting) and his half-blood helper, Luke son of Hermes.<br />Rick Riordan expertly has moved these ancient myths into a modern day setting. Half-bloods are typically kids who are dyslexic and have ADHD, both common problems for modern youth. He has set Mount Olympus on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building in New York and the entrance into the underworld is in Los Angeles. All over the United States are entrances into the Labyrinth marked with the Greek Delta symbol and can only be opened by the touch of a half-blood. The force that causes all mortals to miss all of these mythological places and beings is called \\"the mist\\".<br />This story is filled with amazing lessons that Percy and his friends learn along the way. In the Battle of the Labyrinth in particular, Annabeth is trying to not give up on Luke who was her good friend and saved her life many times when she was little. She alone is willing to believe that he can still be saved from Kronos. Grover and Tyson are very wary of one another and they both put aside their fear and go into the labyrinth with Percy and Annabeth to help their friends. Eventually while down in the never ending maze the group finds a tunnel that Grover thinks will lead them to Pan, the lost god of the Wild. Again, putting their fear aside, Tyson and Grover break off to embark on the important quest of finding Pan to come back and save the wild. Percy is, as always, learning many lessons in this book, but the most important one is that even gods and demigods can still need help from mortals. Near the end he enlists the help of his mortal friend Rachel Elizabeth Dare to help lead them through the labyrinth because she can see through the mist where they cannot and will not be easily mislead by the maze. Eventually all five characters reunite and find the lost god Pan who is fading away because so much of his realm above has been destroyed. He tells them all before he goes that each of them must save their little corner of the wild. This part of the book indeed rung true with my children and as young as they are (four and five years old), they have asked if we could plant a tree in the backyard to help save nature.<br />Rick Riordan writes a very engaging story, laced with sad, happy, funny and very poignant lessons for his young readers, as well as for adults who are reading to their children. Above all, this is a story of friendship and family and how you should never give up on either one. Not only would I recommend this book and this series to young readers but readers who are young at heart as well.<br /><br />Reference<br />Riordan, R. (2009). The Battle of the Labyrinth.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Flight starring Denzel Washington is a movie about a pilot who skillfully and miraculously lands an airliner saving lives. He performs this act while drunk and high. The movie rides the line of alcoholism and drug abuse in the workforce and flight in general.  If you are acquainted with the base line, you will be able to identify with the characters.  Denzel Washington performs excellently.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am amazed at how great this book was. It has made me go back and watch every episode of 30 Rock. I was so happy when she mentioned the guys going pee in the jars and then I saw it on the show! Hilarious and witty.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I'm always skeptical about these battery apps but this one does just what it Says it'll do, manage your battery, and do it in a beautiful & intelligent way. It won't boost your battery or any of those other ridiculous claims I've seen. Basically it gives you ALL the information and tools YOU'LL need to better manage your battery consumption. There's nothing magical about it, it's just a<br />straightforward and elegant way for me to manage my Kindle battery consumption. I Highly recommend this app. If you do purchase this app I recommend that you have your battery at 60% charge level, at least, before you download it so that you can calibrate it to your system & battery when going through the set up in settings.
B003SNKBXW|3.0|Part of the reason that I am so ambivalent about this novel is that I can't decide whether its pros outwiegh its cons.<br /><br />On one hand, it has the makings of an intriguing mystery that appeals to avid readers. Its miles and miles of allusions to literary excellence across the centuries is certainly something that one can find appealing. It may be a bit overtaxing to thos who have never heard of the allusions mentioned, but even if one has not read all the works that are alluded to in Perez-Reverte's novel (as I, admittedly, have not), as long as one has some background knowledge about them, he or she can keep up and find it relatively engaging. The mystery of following Dumas' works and wondering whether Torchia's books are actually a map to the devil drives the plot forward, even past the rather lengthy sections of dialogue.<br /><br />On the other hand, all of the postive feedback I have about the book could also be negative. For instance, the allusions can become tiresome and the real mystery is not Dumas' involvement with the occult but what the Club Dumas has anything to do with Torchia's book. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how to extricate these two disparate threads of plot. I found it confusing at times, especially in the final chapter. Instead of following the mystery genre (which one could reasonably expect considering all of the metaliterary references by the narrator) and bringing clarity to the reader in the end, Perez-Reverte brings confusion.<br /><br />The reader follows Lucas Corso down the serpentine labyrinth of tracking down the three copies of Torchia's book, but the labyrinth is never-ending and the Minotaur is nowhere to be found. I'd be okay with an interminable labyrinth considering one of Torchia's engravings is a maze with no exit, but at least the Minotaur should make an appearance, whether it be in the form of Lucifer's return, the police arresting Corso, or some other beast. As a result, the novel felt rather anticlimactic and left the reader befuddled at what he just spent the last several hours reading. Enjoy the journey, as there seems to be no final destination.and left the reader befuddled at what he just spent the last several hours reading.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As some one with a loved one who is affected by a disease, this novel touched me at a deep level. Parts of the plot make it seem very \\"teenager-y\\" which is appropriate because it is a young adult novel, but its frank and honest ideas on love, family, disease, grief, and loss are applicable for a 60 year old as much as a 16 year old.

B0046B8GEQ|3.0|We love what Amazon has become, however we still choose Netflix.  Here is why.  Even though you have great selection the quality provided is equivalent to that of a bootleg copy.  Sometimes streaming cuts off and we have to wait for it to load.  Netflix never has this problem and the picture is crisp, clean and very enjoyable for the whole family.  I hope you step your game up because it would be great to turn to a website that offers almost everything under the Sun and in excellent quality as well.<br /><br />We have tried the promotional free offer you have given us as well as giving your service another chance a second time by spending our own money.  Third time we will have to be convinced.  We love you though, no harsh feelings, its just constructive criticism no ;) ?

B0080K3G4O|5.0|The full title of this book--\\"The Antidote: Happiness for People who Can't Stand Positive Thinking,\\" implies that positive thinking can be a problem and that this book provides a solution.  However, the statement that \\"positive thinking is a problem\\" would be too strongly worded--and the idea that positive thinking is a problem for only some people would be too limiting.<br /><br />What is problematic, as this book points out, is *over-attached* positive thinking.  It's more the ATTACHMENT to positive goals than the fact that the goals are positive that is the problem.  And this is a problem for MOST people in Western culture, not just those who are cynical enough to be repelled by Norman Vincent Peale and his ilk.<br /><br />Through an amusing array of journalistic anecdotes--his visits to places such as the Insight Meditation Center in Barre MA, \\"The Museum of Failure\\" in Ann Arbor, the death shrine in Tepito, Mexico and to a lively cemetary during Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) in Mexico, or the slum of Kibera in Kenya, and his interviews or summaries of the work of characters such as the ever-crusty Albert Ellis, the ephemeral Eckhardt Tolle, or security expert Bruce Schneier (noted for his opposition to the 9/11 security crackdown)--Burkman makes his case for \\"the negative path to happiness.\\"<br /><br />The negative path to happiness is to embrace insecurity, failure, and death--to learn that these are inevitable aspects of life, and to gain the perspective that death and impermanence are the very things that make life and our positive experiences so precious, and that our repeated failures are what lead us to eventually succeed--and to, above all, learn perspective and non-attachment to experiences and outcomes, and the art of non-doing, in opposed to our more typical goal-striving and grasping, which often ironically backfire to make us miserable rather than happy.<br /><br />In the course of the book, Burkman reviews approaches such as those of the Stoic philosophers and the Buddhists, and touches on psychological theories such as Dan Wegner's theory of ironic processes ([[ASIN:0140115994 White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts]]), Albert Ellis's distinct brand of cognitive behavioral therapy (with its emphasis on how the \\"Musts\\" that we create for ourself are what create our misery, and how embracing the worst case can make us realize that what is actually happening is not so bad in comparison) ([[ASIN:0806527382 How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable about Anything: Yes Anything!]]) and Ernest Becker's theory of the denial of death (and associated modern research from terror management theory)(e.g., [[ASIN:1557989540 In the Wake of 9-11: The Psychology of Terror]]), and work from theorists who stress the downside risks of goal-setting ([[ASIN:023000332X Destructive Goal Pursuit: The Mt. Everest Disaster]]).<br /><br />Reading Oliver Burkman's book was, for me, like going to a convention--there was the chance to mingle and catch up with old friends (including, for me, Shoma Morita [[ASIN:B008L3WOO8 Constructive Living (Kolowalu Books)]]and Irving Yalom [[ASIN:B00AG8HJ4G Love's Executioner]]) and to meet like-minded new ones, and there was a huge buffet of ideas, each one of you are provided a chance to nibble at.  But for each person that you meet in the book, there is just the chance to say hello and never the chance to fully catch up, and for each tasty morsel, there is just a nibble.  Burkman succeeds in bringing together and finding commonality in a wide variety of ideas, and for that he is to be commended.  This is more a book to whet the appetite than to provide any true satiation--but as any Seeker knows, one grows from the process of asking and seeking answers to questions, not from having the answers themselves.<br /><br />For what it is--a journalistic account, and not a philosophical treatise or psychological theory--this is an excellent and entertaining book.<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br />There are three things that I wish were improved.<br /><br />First, his final chapter summarizing the \\"negative path\\" to happiness could have been more substantive--the best material on \\"the negative path\\" is in the first chapter of the book, and could have been reiterated and elaborated more in the conclusion.<br /><br />Second, while hugely wide-ranging and having the idea that some people will be turned off by positive thinking in the very title, Burkman somehow missed out on the wonderful work on defensive pessimism (see [[ASIN:0465051391 The Positive Power of Negative Thinking: Using Defensive Pessimism to Harness Anxiety and Perform at Your Peak]], which would help address the question of which people might be turned off by the positive thinking approach and why. Some people are more motivated by \\"approach\\" and others by \\"avoidance\\"--and this issue will be explored in the forthcoming book [[ASIN:1594631026 Focus: Use Different Ways of Seeing the World for Success and Influence]], whose publication I eagerly anticipate.<br /><br />Finally, the book, by its nature, lumps all positive thinking together and doesn't get at its nuances.  There is wonderful work done in the field of positive psychology, and the idea of balance--that happiness involves BOTH removing the causes of unnecessary suffering (which is what \\"The Antidote\\" focuses on) AND adding potential causes of happiness (for example, remembering to do a \\"Gratitude check,\\" expanding one's social network, and doing \\"random acts of kindness\\" for others)--is missing here.  (People interested in exploring a more balanced approach which combines these ideas might explore the work on Acceptance & Commitment Therapy, developed by Steven Hayes but most readably introduced by Russ Harris ([[ASIN:1459609832 The Happiness Trap]]), and might also explore valuable works in Positive Psychology such as Sonja Lyubormirsky's [[ASIN:1594204373 The Myths of Happiness: What Should Make You Happy, but Doesn't, What Shouldn't Make You Happy, but Does]], which is about how we can do a great deal to make ourselves happier by stopping believing/doing those things which we think will make us happier but actually make us miserable--an idea which fits very well with \\"The Antidote.\\"<br /><br />As the Buddhists say, \\"pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.\\"  (I would add to that, \\"joy is possible, but fleeting.\\")  Reading this book and further exploring the ideas and approaches you are introduced to here can be a way learn to avoid that suffering.***************************************************************************************************************************<br />There are three things that I wish were improved.<br /><br />First, his final chapter summarizing the \\"negative path\\" to happiness could have been more substantive--the best material on \\"the negative path\\" is in the first chapter of the book, and could have been reiterated and elaborated more in the conclusion.<br /><br />Second, while hugely wide-ranging and having the idea that some people will be turned off by positive thinking in the very title, Burkman somehow missed out on the wonderful work on defensive pessimism (see [[ASIN:0465051391 The Positive Power of Negative Thinking: Using Defensive Pessimism to Harness Anxiety and Perform at Your Peak]], which would help address the question of which people might be turned off by the positive thinking approach and why.

1616614609|5.0|I played the original Netrunner (WotC) back in the 90s and this takes one of the best card games ever designed and improves upon it.<br />* Gone is the collectable model (al la Magic the Gathering). Living Card Games (LCGs) give you a complete set of cards with each box (and supplementary sets, see the Genesis Cycle).<br />* The addition of factions and influence makes deck building better (there are starter decks that don't require much knowledge to start).<br />* The bits help you track all of the game state (gone are the need for dice, tokens, etc.).<br />This game has a learning curve, but if you want a thinking person's card game, this is it.<br />NOTE: There are some cards that only have 1 or 2 copies in this box. It is possible to play (even competitively) without buying another core set, but many will say 2 core sets is what you need for tournament play (depending on your deck build). All expansion packs come with 3 copies of each card (the max number of any card that can be in a deck).

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I rented this movie because I enjoy Meryl Streep and she did not disappoint me.  I also expected there to be more comedy and humor to deal with a serious topic. It is not light hearted and only okay because of it's darker, serious side.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|I was inspired to read this after seeing the stage play and the academy award nominated movie.  It has helped me to understand much that was unexplained and vague in those productions, especially the agonies of Jean Valjean and Javert in dealing with their moral dilemmas of right versus wrong.<br />I rated the book four stars rather than five only because it was difficult to wade through the laboriously long philosophical and historical passages of the author.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great movie, in my opinion.  I agree that the trailer doesn't do it justice.  I thought it was going to be a low budget, grade B movie, and exclusively centered on time travel -- but it isn't.  Well acted, good story, good effects...in a word, immersive.  I would have rated it five stars, except the science fiction (time travel) end of it was a bit predictable.  Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but it seems whenever a story contains time travel, the causality is a little too linear, or neat.  They touched on this briefly -- the main character (Willis) refers to a certain fogginess of mind due to changes in his memory, but as usual the character isn't really affected, and the environment/circumstances do not change.  I guess it's difficult to make such changes and maintain a coherent storyline.  In any case, the film was better than the current 3.5 rating, in my opinion -- almost didn't rent it, and (unlike with many rentals these days) don't regret paying for it.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Enjoyable hidden object game.  Mini games break up the monotony.  Has one of the better stories for this type of game.  I actually found myself reading the story instead of just skipping through it the way I usually do.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I bought this movie, and a couple others to try out my new 3d TV.  The 3d in this is hands down the best I've seen. Overall the movie was decent, light hearted and entertaining, the big selling point to Mr seas the 3d, it was clear the movie was directed with the idea of 3d in mind. The look of the 3d was very convincing, and there were several effects that came well out of the screen (I flinched several time because it seemed like something was about to hit me)<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you want to see a movie fully leverage the capabilities of 3d

B00942XWWI|4.0|I liked this movie but not enough to give it 5 stars. Still well worth watching but it didn't hold me like Black Hawk<br />down or Saving Private Ryan did. Still if you haven't seen it and on the fence go for it and watch it.
B004GXZ69W|4.0|I love this vertical mouse. I've had one for 5+ years, and the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that I was starting to feel at the time were greatly reduced after I started using it. A side benefit of having an unconventional mouse is the puzzled look of my colleagues when they try to use my computer.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />I'm 6'5\\" and I have big hands, other ergonomic mice that I have tried felt too small (the Microsoft Natural Wireless Mouse 6000 particularly). This is the one that fit the best.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />My problem with this mouse is that it seens to made of light plastic and it feels cheap, but more importantly the purple paint coat on the buttons started chipping about 3 years into using it. I use this mouse for about 5 hours every work day, and I would love to say that these signs of tear are reasonable, but I do not see that happening with other brands and I certainly do not expect it to happen for a mouse that costs ~$90. The Microsoft Mouse line for example, which is where I looked first for an ergonomic mouse, feels more like a premium product in your hand - but alas none was big enough for my hands),<br /><br />But I am still happy with the Evoluent VerticalMouse, all in all and I recommend you give it a try if you want to give your wrist some well deserved rest.

B008JFUMT2|1.0|The first four \\"Die Hard\\" films have something in common. No, not the fact that things blow up, or that Bruce Willis is going to say funny things. Underneath all of the explosions, gunshots, and profanity lies a strong character, interesting plots, and memorable set pieces. This is why it is incredibly disheartening that I saw \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" less than 24 hours ago, yet can barely remember any of it. There were some explosions, a helicopter... maybe Willis said something funny once? Perhaps twice?<br /><br />I'm not quite sure, but what I am sure of is that this is one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Everybody involved should be embarrassed about this miserable abomination of a film, and request that it be removed from their resume. The plot is garbage, it's xenophobic and homophobic, and to top it all off, the action isn't even inspired. \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is a disgrace to a once great franchise.<br /><br />We kick things off with John McClane searching for his son in Russia, who was magically never mentioned for four films. In that span of time, John McClane Jr. (ooh, original!) has apparently become a degenerate and been thrown in prison. But as we quickly find out, he's actually a CIA Agent! And Bruce Willis has to help him, but is employing meatheaded tactics for espionage missions! It's a giant culture clash! Oh, the hilarious shenanigans! Mix it up with some classic \\"American trying to speak a foreign language\\" and \\"like father, like son\\" gags, add in some monosyllabic tough guy dialogue, and you've got a surefire recipe for cinematic gold.<br /><br />Except you don't. The story in this movie is the narrative equivalent of an overflowed gutter: you're seeing nothing but ugly mush of something that was maybe, at some point, kind of pretty. Dialogue is simplistic and unfunny, the narrative is derivative and moronic, and there's a disgusting gay stereotype of a character. Nothing even remotely original occurs in the span of this film, and I feel genuinely sorry for Willis and all others involved having to participate in a movie that was seemingly penned by a third-grader with access to the internet.<br /><br />However, something about the story is more infuriating than the rest of it, and it deserves note: the villains. Namely, the fact that their goal is never stated. All we know is that they are Russian, and that they might want uranium. No, really, that's it. That's all they give us. We're just supposed to assume that a Russian scientist wants uranium left in Chernobyl for nefarious purposes, for no reason other than the fact that he's a Russian scientist. Oh, and there's the little fact that the American father and son beat out the Russian father and daughter, therefore adding sexism onto the laundry list of this film's dubious achievements.<br /><br />But maybe you don't care about plot. Maybe you're in it for big-budget action. Well, get ready for disappointment, because the action sequences are some of the most dull and uninspired I've ever seen. Yawn with apathy as Bruce Willis defies physics in a car! Play \\"Angry Birds\\" as he jumps off a thirty story building and lives! And go to the bathroom as a villain falls into a vertically-rotating helicopter blade as it traverses a horizontal plane! Heck, while you're in there, you might as well stay out and go home, because this trash won't get any better.<br /><br />What really tops it off is that the budget feels nonexistent. The cinematography is a joke, some shots looking like they might as well be stock footage. The overused CGI is pretty hokey too, becoming downright cheesy and ludicrous about halfway throughout the movie. That is, if you haven't fallen asleep already, which the grating and jarring sound effects will try to prevent quite frequently. On a technical level, this movie is a joke, and makes me actually want to sit through a Michael Bay movie because of how terrible it is.<br /><br />Some may think this review indicates that I hate plotless action movies, and I'll have you know that I love the \\"Expendables\\" franchise, and pretty much anything with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Statham taking the top billing. This movie has not earned my ire because it is an action movie with no plot; it's earned it because it's an action movie with poor action and a plot that tries to be emotionally engaging but fails in a spectacular fashion. This is insipid cinematic garbage of the lower caliber, and should put a nail in the coffin of writer Skip Woods, whose past credits includes the awful \\"Hitman\\" film.<br /><br />Now, I laughed my way through this movie, so if you want to pay ten bucks to laugh at how terrible a film is, then by all means, go see this. But if you want to go see it because you have fond memories of the old films, then you deserve to know that \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is a failure on every possible level. It is a bottom-of-the-barrel carnival ride with an awful plot and lame action sequences, with no funny one-liners or interesting villains to speak of. When the year ends, I have a strong feeling that this will be a surefire candidate to take the Razzy for \\"Worst Picture.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps John McClane needs to \\"yippee ki-yay\\" into the sunset... and a retirement home.<br /><br />Grade: Fndicates that I hate plotless action movies, and I'll have you know that I love the \\"Expendables\\" franchise, and pretty much anything with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Statham taking the top billing.

0060174900|3.0|This book made me go from happy moods to very depressed moods and did not really make me feel better.I liked it for the literary quality but add far as the sorry goes I would recommend people who are suffering from depression to not read this book until you feel better...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. It runs pretty well, with the occasional freeze up. There are a few pop ups, but it is a free game. Overall it is a great game.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|I like the throttle quadrant, not much documentation came with the product. Instructions were basic and were a good starting point. I was able to better understand the setup via utube videos from other users. The equipment operated ok right out of the box.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, did have zoom for HO, had unique features;  ie: a monkey to go get faraway objects &amp; was really cute, good story &amp; puzzles and played great on my Kindle Fire.  Hope it is true there will be a sequel. I would DEF buy !
B004LROMQG|4.0|I have been watching Merlin since it started on TV.  I love the series.  That is why I purchase the CDs so I can watch it over again when I choose.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|all I can say is that it is just simply amazing I would recommend everyone to have it! its that awesome<br />~2&infin;&amp;&uarr;
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This cable never did work on my old kindle.  I worked maybe 12 times on my new kindle, and now no longer will charge.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Finally, a television series to love!  The setting is an existing castle near London.  Fascinating!  There are 16 characters around which the story revolves...the storyline is complex and interesting.  Historical events anchor the story along with introductions of developments in technology as each made way into everyday life, such as the auto and telephone.  All of the aspects of a changing society and the effects of those changes are included making the series one to thoroughly enjoy.  Not to mention a stellar cast, beautiful clothes, people with manners and a concept of a fading lifestyle.  Love! Love! Love!  This series will be one to watch and enjoy over and again...
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Great for my kids when we are out on the road, or when they are waiting for one another at pracatice.
B009VYF5E2|4.0|I purchased this Fourth Season since I am an avid watcher of Merlin.  I think it is a great series and I hope it continues for several more years.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Did not expect the amount of challenge in the game, I keep going back to figure out more stratigeies.  Fun for 2 minutes or two hours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just like the site and s little bit better. I loved on my phone and its even better on the kindle. If you are a pinterest<br />freak like me you will use it all the time.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I thought this was pretty fun movie although it didn't have anything really different from the first two movies. Worth renting for sure.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Pretty popular with my 3 year old son! he is in LOVE WITH Any AND ALL ANGRY BIRDS!  LOVE IT
B0041KVZ18|5.0|To all the bad reviews here, I don't know what the problem was about. My copy was perfect, nearly flawless. The sound was great and the packaging was awesome. I'm from M&eacute;xico, and this album was very hard to find on vinyl for me, so I was very happy when I knew that new reissiues on vinyl were going to come out. Now I can have The Beatles albums on vinyl without paying too much for them.
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this app in hopes of being able to listen to Alex Jones. Did not find him in the menu/index, so I put him in the search box and Boom! There he was!  The great thing about this app is once I start a radio program to play, i can then open my web browser and surf the net whilst listening to Alex Jones and without it skipping a beat.
1419705849|5.0|My 10 years old son is a big fan of the Whimpy Kid series - and this book was no exception.  Kid-humor (you know what I mean...) first-person narratives told through words and line drawings.  He reads them again and again.
030758836X|5.0|Highly recommend it! I read it in two days. Couldn't put it down. It's a awesome thrilling story with characters unlike you have ever seen.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is by far my new fav. SHOW!<br />EVEN MY KIDS LOVE IT! Walter is an all time hit at my house! :)
B007U4DIM6|5.0|My son loves all of these movies. This one was very funny and great for people of all ages. Loved it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Everything worked perfectly and I use this everyday.  It makes everything extremely easy and helps my work day go quickly
B005OCFHHK|5.0|A good collection of all the Harry Potter films.  Enjoying the details. colors and depth of the blu-ray edition on our 46-inch Panasonic flat screen TV.  Great for family movie nights!  and cold winter weekends.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I wasn't sure how it would end or that it ever would. Action packed until the end, the Death Cure left no loose ends or questions unanswered.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|THIS IS A HIT, i really dont see the difference between the free down load and this? However, my kids are on it more than me so who knows they love both! I however do not see and difference. save your self some money and just get the free down load HD is SOOO over rated.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Is an excellent game to play the best way to get to the end is go through and die if you did and find gems in the game.
1936850028|5.0|Walter Rhein possesses an uncanny way to suck you in to Birkie fever as he tells great stories of his own experiences growing up in the Hayward area having a grandfather who mentored him about the lifestyle of living in Birkie country.  This is a fantastic read especially when the Birkie is less than a week away.  It is a fun book with many light hearted stories about the process of living the other 364 days of the year.  You won't want to put this down.  I hope to run in to you at this years Birkie.  Who knows, you may be skiing right next to Walter at this years Birkie without even knowing it.
074356619X|5.0|The pictures in the gallery make it look like you are getting the Unabridged version, but when I got it in the mail, it looked like a regular version. It doesn't have the label (Unabridged) at the top like it does in the picture and it didn't come in a big box like I see in the gallery. Oh well, the &#34;standard&#34; CD is just as good. Her positive mindset is phenomenal BUT i suggest you start reading Eckhart Tolle's philosophy first because even though &#34;The Secret&#34; is very good, if you don't identify the pain body or the ego in your mind, you can get very easily lost in the movement of thought.  It shows in the other people who give it bad reviews. It's not a scam, it's great information to pass on, but read Eckhart Tolle's &#34;The Power Of Now&#34; first and then &#34;A New Earth&#34; Before this is what I recommend.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I like all of the transformers movies. This one is fun too. I would recommend it to any fan of the first two movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game! Me and my friends have competitions to see who can get hired scores all the time. I love the new update you should try for a new one soon. I suggest you go with something like a London england themed game. That would be a ton of fun.
B0049GYXGI|5.0|This is a good family movie you laugh, cry, it's good to have a good clean family movie to watch with the whole family can sit down and watch a movie together as a family.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I am 13 years old I like this game there are different crazy things you can do and you can put monks suit on if you buy it ME my 14 year old brother my dad and mom all like this game so I gave it 5 stars
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|The story line is a little extreme but is a typical Miyazaki fantacy.  I like this one better than Totoro.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|If you enjoy an interesting, uplifting tale well told, watch Searching for Sugarman. The less you know about it before viewing the better. As the story unfolds you might wonder, as I did, how it's going to be so amazing that someone would strongly recommend it. By the time it's over you will wonder no more. As a matter of fact you'll find yourself recommending it, too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Exciting from beginning to end.<br />I can read this book again and again. It's better then watching the movie.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This book was ok.  I enjoyed Gone Girl more.  Almost too many things going on with main character.  Surprise ending.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Just loving it overall with one exception. If I take a call through the blue tooth option, I have to restart the headset in order to hear my friends on chat again.
B004W4N55C|2.0|This app is the 1.1 version and the play store has the 1.8.7. The Amazon appstore needs to make the newest version available. Especially for the amount of money the app costs.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm so glad to have the UK edition.  Once I caught Downton Abbey fever, I had some catching up to do, and I am very pleased with the quality and price of this set.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Like this better than Weather Bug. No problem finding my location.  Lots of great features. Very impressed. I especially like the radar map and that it shows red flag alerts. This is a keeper for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loads of fun, works great on Kindle. A glitches every so often, but otherwise perfect. I recommend this game, but be warned, it is addictive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so hard and very awesome if there was a scale from 1 to 10 I would say 1000.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the most amazing books I have ever read!!!!  It so good!! I would totally recommend this book if you love to read all kinds of books!!
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|This movie makes me feel good every time I see it.<br />Whitney Houston was one of the greatest voices ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a fan of Grisham and was not disappointed with this current book.  He knows how to weave an absorbing tale even when it gets a bit farfetched.  Put up your feet in front of the fireplace, sip a little wine and enjoy the book.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|For the first Animals’album, Eric Burdon wrote « Story of Bo Diddley” which opened the LP with excitement. This title was more a talking blues than a pop song and, as a teenager, I raved about it. Really, I was mad about it.<br />Some time after… in Burdon’s new CD we find “Bo Diddley Special” a thrilling moment which delights me. This is the best example I can find to describe a kind of faithfulness which characterizes Eric Burdon. Of course there is much more in ‘Til Your River Runs Dry. Burdon and his musicians took the all thing seriously with inspiration and musicianship. Eris is as ever, passionate, glorious, generous, sober at a time and “too much” just after. We hear in this record a kind of testimony of a career. But we hear also just raving rhythm’n’blues, or Eric Burdon’s music, whatever you wish to name it. The first time I saw the Animals at the Paris Olympia, they blew my mind, especially Eric. They were right, he was right and I was right. The proof (if necessary) is here, in the beautiful “Til Your River Runs Dry. Enjoy !
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This product works wonders, it allowed me with the use of a separate multi-audio splitter to amplify the sound coming through (because if using the splitter by itself the sound is often extremely quiet). Completely wireless this product does a great job at amplifying the audio your listening too!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I really loved this movie. I thought it was very tastefully done and told a wonderful story.<br />Kudos to Helen Hunt for her taking her clothes off with dignity.
B0012GN0JE|5.0|To each their own and I'm surprised to see so many neutral to poor reviews of this fine album. I love many songs on it and I feel it's a really good album. It deserves a far better rating than it has averaged here, but to each their own. Don't let these reviews fool you, it's a great album, unique to anything else he's ever made.
030759565X|5.0|I gave this to my husband for Valentine's Day. My son highly recommended this book, he's used many of the recipes and has been very pleased with all of the finished products.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Gail Carriger has a clever way of making the Parasol Protectorate series fun, endearing and action packed.  I was only going to read one of her books but ended up reading them all.  She is an author I will certainly keep my eye on in the future.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie had a bit of everything.<br />Denzel shows a full range of emotions and reminds us why he is is such a good actor.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really did enjoy the book but I wish there was more explained by Dorothy.IT left me wanting more discussion about how the mother felt living her life as someone else, did her husband know the truth? and her daughter read her husband previous books and that was never tied back into the story. Just a lot unanswered for me!It left me feeling frustrated!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great coming of age book, I'm a high school librarian and I've suggested it for several of my students. Good read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|A hurricane, or a marching band could sweep through the house and you would never hear it, in fact, the house could burn down around you and you never heard a thing. Serious gaming, the world does not exist
B003L77G2Y|4.0|JUST CAUGHT THIS SERIES ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND.  GOT INTO IT JUST IN TIME TO CATCH THE SERIES FINALE.  GOT ADDICTED AND HAD TO HAVE THE FULL SET.  THANKS.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It constantly surprises. I carried it with me everywhere and finished it in a few days. Truly original the author never fails to surprise.
0062018205|5.0|Some points or studies may not be new, but the author wrote the book in a very lively way. It is easy for readers to understand. I found many cases in the book also happening in my everyday life. I started to look at my daily activities in another way after reading the book. And for sure, many studies can apply to business. I'm going to conduct experiments myself :)
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I was hoping for a little more action, but the pilot's personal story was compelling. It had a good message, you can overcome your addicitons.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|JUST CAUGHT THIS FIRST SEASON OF THE SERIES ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND.  GOT INTO IT JUST IN TIME TO CATCH THE SERIES FINALE.  GOT ADDICTED AND HAD TO HAVE THE FULL SET.  THANKS.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Enjoy any stories regarding WWII.  This is a movie with the Japanese perspective.  It was<br />quite moving  ordeal they went through, at the whims of their Emperor.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It's a fun hide and seek game and unlike some reviews say, you don't have to log on to facebook, you just have to close the box. It is a bit annoying how often it asks though.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is an incredible story, brilliantly filmed, and with a great score.<br />The music is 43 years old. I don't know how any of us missed it. Rodriguez should have been a star. It's taken a long time, but he's finally received the recognition he deserved.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I was disappointed by the music.  Did not connect me to the movie or the characters.  Disappointed.  Product was good, content was not.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my daughter loves this game. agood time killer and way to get her use to electronics. almost an addiction for the two of us.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I have been waiting to write this review for so long because i wanted to see it a second time to make sure i seen the same damn movie. Well i just rented the dvd and is not the same movie i saw in the theaters. Its worse. I really wont go into the movie yet, this review is just going to be about the dvd. They watered down the sound effects in the bane/batman confrontation so<br />batman getting his weak ass stomped wasnt asexciting for me. And they cut out bane<br />breaking his back! What!!! Ill be back<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Well Amazon i am back. I am going to take my time with this review, because the day i saw the trailer for this joke of a movie i put my life on hold for 7 months until i saw the trilogy. Batman<br />begins and the Dark Knight, two of the best<br />movie experiences i ever had in my life. Then<br />came tdkr not only the most anticipated movie<br />of my life, but the most anticipated ANYTHING<br /> in my life. I dont think i looked foward to<br /> anything like this movie.First, we start with the<br /> trailers. Not really trailers fitting this movie but<br />whatever. But this was the first bad feeling i got<br />but i let it slide. The Superman trailer was alright<br />though. So starts the movie. The Syncopy and<br />DC logos were awesome and they got me excited<br />about a great movie. Then we had the classic<br />way Nolan starts out the Batman movies with<br />some kind of effect that displays the bat symbol.<br />Excellent.<br /><br />Then the first voice. Commisioner Gordon. It did not sound anything like the voice from the other two movies but whatever it is 8 yrs later.<br />Ok hes talking about harvey kind of reminding<br />us of how the last one ended. Okay. The<br />problem started when i heard Banes voice. What the f*** kind of a voice is that?! Ill be back.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Now lets bring in our star, Bruce Wayne. He comes in hobbiling on a cane like an old man.<br />What the hell happened? Last time i remember<br />he was running from the cops. So when did he<br /> become a cripple? Then Selyna kicks his cane<br />out from under him like a helpless child. At that<br /> point i knew this movie was not going to live up<br /> to my expectations. But it was only the first 15<br />min of the movie so i tried not to jump to<br />conclusions. Then this frickin kid comes to see<br />him and tells him that he knows hes batman. Why? Because of a freakin look on his face. Really?? Ill be back.s running from the cops. So when did he<br /> become a cripple? Then Selyna kicks his cane<br />out from under him like a helpless child.

0062238868|4.0|This is an interesting look behind the scenes into the life and career of America's top sniper and some of his buddies.<br /><br />Recommended read to anyone interested in the SEALS and what they do and how they do it.
B005ZHBA9I|4.0|Music was great.  Plays well and reminds me of the movie.  Great pics and posters included.  Enjoy the music. Twilight Lives Forever.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Like the title of my review says, this game is beautiful. I was sceptical about this game at first but I was amazed by the art in this game. It is a nice game that gives a puzzle like gameplay experience that comes with a beautiful music soundtrack. Seriously this is truly now one beautiful app that I recommend getting. Not to mention that is the fastest app I have ever seen downloaded onto a kindle fire. This is a truly beautiful game that everyone should try. It totally deserves this 5 star review.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!! I cant stop playing it. I just wish there were unlimited boundaries. other than that I say its worth the $7.00
B000AAF1U4|5.0|We ordered this as a gift, not knowing that my daughter already owned it.  No problem returning it for credit.  Amazon is great!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found it hard to get into first section but sections 2 and 3 very good and wrapped the book up well
0307594165|5.0|A sensitive, moving novel about love and family and the struggle to overcome the effects of racism in this country. As usual Ms. Morrison does not disappoint. Her technique as well as the story itself is superior as always.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Experienced the movie in IMAX and still felt strongly enough to get the Blu-Ray. Saw it once I received it in the mail lent it to my brother who said he hated it compared to The Dark Knight and haven't seen it since. So, I guess that means it gets better the more times you watch it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|A very good movie.  It may not have been Disney / Pixar's best, but it is still good family entertainment.
B001O1O71C|3.0|The book was good and I liked the pointing story but it took 18 chapters to reach the main conflict or the resolution and I felt that that was too long. But I did like the metaphors in the book and how Bruno was so naive. It was overall hood but not 4 or 5 stars worth.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|lots of fun, easy to play, except @ times, when you understand the meaning &#34; angry birds &#34; They can make you  ANGRY !!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|grandkids  like this just need more selections of horses an things for them to do however this was good small kids
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Costumes and set design make you feel you are really in the period of this movie.  The plot and all its twists are amazing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|We all love this game. It makes you strategize and plan out your moves. We haven't leveled up enough to open up higher levels but we will get there.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|These are all great so far, who ever thought these up, Thanks...  great way to kill time, easy to save & start up again later.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I like the game hard to play on kindel this is only a trial them you have to buy the game
B00866JL96|3.0|Movie was good, but the product was the problem. I could not get the UltraViolet Digital to download, no where near the expiration date yet said it had hit the limit.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the Sidney Sheldon parallel of chapters mixing between characters; keeps the reader wanting to continue reading to get to the next chapter.  The twist in the middle keeps the reader in suspense.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|another great game, as is all of these,  fun, easy & hard, just a little new spin on the game.
B000002H70|5.0|my friend told about this album and i got it , , this the cure coolest album ! all the song its like a poem !
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There were some long drawn out spots where it got a little boring, but then something big would happen to bring you back in.  I didn't particularly care for the ending.  I was glad they got back together, but it would have been better to have some detail on how that happened.
B0028K3192|4.0|Maxwell has that smooth sound that you want to listen to again and again, great cd to add to any collection.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|Brilliant pairing musically!  I've been a fan of Beth's for over twelve years!<br /><br />When she sings the blues, I feel all those emotions and memories  bubbling up!  It's my Release and I Love It!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|what can i say about deftones ? that they are one of those bands that get even better with time , you hear the first album , you love it , then you hear their second album its even better , and so on till we get here : koi no yokan , an amazing album , great songs , truly inspiring ! definetly one of my all times favorite bands!
B008PWUYVA|2.0|I was dissatisfied because the velcro that holds the case shut has peeled off. I have not owned the case for very long and have not even taken it anywhere outside of the house.
0307719219|5.0|Why Nations Fail is a valuable reading for development economists. Important lessons are to be learned from it. Recommend this book to Policy Makers, Economics Students and Economics Practitioners. Acemoglu and Robinson's Institutional Vision/Theory is too robust as an explanation of why some nations are underdeveloped and poor (while others developed and prosperous) and why will continue in that status, unless something of a change (in their institutional arrangement) occurs in the near future.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am addicted to this game and I am always playing it. Love it and was glas I purchased it. Would do it again
1451695195|3.0|I felt that there was a lot of New Age imagery in this book. I had also never heard God referred to as &#34;Om&#34;. I think if God ever wanted us to know Him by this name, He would have mentioned it in the Bible. He has several titles but this was a new one on me. I think possibly this author was talking to a different spirit altogether. The information in this book did not line up with what I have read in all the other books about people who have gone to Heaven. I never doubted that Heaven exists, But I can't accept the account of this author's experience.
0525953728|5.0|I am not even finished with the book but am leading into the raid itself. The author paints such a vivid picture of not just the operations themselves, but the camaraderie between himself and his teammates through training, the missions, and everything in between. The end of most of the chapters, especially toward the end actually give me chills and a healthy shot of adrenaline. Great book and great story.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Not bad but could have been a lot better with some more work or maybe on the script.Had good actors and director.
1603429999|5.0|This is one of the best and most helpful knitting books I have seen!  I have her Knitting Answer Book which I received as a gift and use often and wanted to learn more about circular knitting so bought this.  If you are at all interested in circular knitting this book is a must have.
B0014H32MG|5.0|My husband recommended this book. I love Stephen King. Good recommendation. The recommendation was sparked by us reading and watching Hunger Games.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Tough I did enjoy the app. I found having to go back to menu to sidestep the dialoge a little annoying. I did enjoy the expanded of the pic. It would be nice if all games had this quality.
1932100660|5.0|BooK: is in excellent condition.  I have not gotten around to reading it yet but it looks great. Thank you.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Excellent! Hilarious without the crudeness of so many movies these days. A true Laugh Out Loud movie. Worth the time to watch!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the whole series. These books were so addicting. Cliff hangers at every ending!!! Very different. Very creative. Highly recommend.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was part of a build for a housemate who was using an old Dell from 2002 as entertainment PC. He wanted a faster and better quality entertainment experiance from an entertainment system and this processor delivered for him. This was to be a budget build with a cap of $400.00. I hit that on the dot for him and he is very happy with the result as am I.<br />IT'S LIGHTENING FAST!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great way to pass the time away whenever I am sitting and waiting!  Works very well with no freezing.  Totally addicted!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|At first, I loved this game and then all the sudden it stopped working on my kindle fire. The problem is that ot will bump me out of the game when before I get to the main menu of the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the whole series. I highly recommend all three books. The movie was not bad either. These books are addicting!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the first time I have seen this film, and I have to say it kept my interest from beginning to end! It started off with some great action, and yes, I admit it did slow down somewhat but half way into the film it picked up big time! I guess the one's that say this was boring were looking for a big bang shootout throughout the movie.<br />The bluray picture is absolutely stunning, as is the sound. 10/10 for both! If you're looking for a good action film with a decent storyline, this is the one for you!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I found the first book in this trilogy difficult to get into...put it down many times before finishing it. The second was a little more intriguing, but this third and final book was captivating, exciting, and one if the best reads I've enjoyed in years! Unexpected surprises along the way - a true delight...sad that the author died and never got to revel in the success of this series.
B0093BUWGE|4.0|But I was glad for a friends recommendation. Very broad influences are evident on the album. Grammy contender in the R& B?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was different from other books by Stephen King. I did like it. Time travel is fun to read about.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|I started off with flOw, then moved to Flower, and then last Journey.<br /><br />flOw left a bad taste in my mouth and the controls didn't work that great. After I stopped playing it and then picked it back up again, it seemed to work better. Flower was more enjoyable and the controls seemed to work better also, but Journey is where it is at.<br /><br />Journey is an experience you should not miss. I was surprised at how much I was enjoying myself after playing the last two games. I think what really makes Journey special is the random person who can join in on your game. Getting a good partner can make for a really great experience. If you're going to play this, make sure you are on an internet connection so you can get a surprise visit from someone else who is trying to enjoy the game.
030771652X|2.0|hated the book, only read it for book club. it's derivative, very similar plot device to \\"life of pi\\" and \\"slumdog millionaire\\". it was easy to guess who the bad guy was. she wrote very well about the feelings of loss in the beginning of the book, but it was downhill from there.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is what all alcoholics and drug addicts say.<br /><br />A great performance (Oscar worthy) by Denzel Washington, in a movie with a good script, and great acting but with a predictable ending. Whip Whitaker (Washington) is an alcoholic airline pilot who saves everybody's life (except four people) while trying to land a defective plane. He is also a cocaine addict. Because of the investigation, his drug addiction is revealed and we are in for a solid, amazing, and great performance from Washington that ends as expected. During the movie John Goodman's role as a drug dealer is just fabulous. He is arrogant, funny, and efficient and he is needed by the upper echelon of our society! The movie also reveals the corruption of the pilot's union who are trying to get out of the NTSB investigation by lying. It is not surprising that the union thugs will lie, will do whatever it takes to save their own, and are all corrupt. It just confirms my opinion of the unions.<br /><br />I am not certain that Denzel Washington will win the Oscar against Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln, or Joaquin Phoenix in the Master, but all three of them deserve it, although Lincoln is an outstanding movie and the entire cast was nominated as expected.<br /><br />Four stars because of Washington and Goodman and because of the music. The soundtrack is fabulous. When Goodman appears on the scene with his back pack, sunglasses, and the \\"merch\\" (he appears in two scenes) he really steals the show...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series. I highly recommend all three books. The movie was not bad either. These books are addicting!!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|led zeppelin returns and kicks butt.  need anything be said?  the music and video are well done and the price was great.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I do wish they'd issued the full soundtrack, and can't figure out why they left out 'A Little Fall of Rain' and the initial 'Do You Hear the People Sing?' in particular, but it's a terrific album and the price when I bought it could not be beat.<br /><br />Still trying to figure out why Russell Crowe got so much hate thrown at him. His Javert is a very different vocal interpretation than the Javerts from the state production, but he sings well and acts the hell out of the character in every song.<br /><br />BTW, I just heard that the full soundtrack will come out next month. Will probably not buy it again, as this has most of the songs, but will buy favorite individual songs to fill it out.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Great movie for social work programs and students.  Also good for anyone in the human services field.  Heartfelt and passionate.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it kept my interest and let me say that is not easy. I recommend this book to all ages and the photographs were wonderful.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I originally found out about Emeli Sande around late 2011/early 2012 through an online radio link from one of the local radio stations (97.1 washfm). \\"Our Version Of Events\\" by Emeli Sande contains a blend of pleasant and heartwarming songs that evoke strong emotions within the soul.  \\"Heaven\\", \\"My Kind Of Love\\", and \\"Mountains\\" were three of the songs that struck deep emotional cords with me.  I also enjoyed \\"Next To Me\\" because it reminded me of the unconditional love that my husband has for me.  \\"Our Version Of Events\\" by Emeli Sande is great for those who like warm love song collections.
1466401885|5.0|Looking forward to the next one.  There were things I did not like as with any book but it was definitely a page turner
B008MM9630|4.0|This is an extremely fun and entertaining way to relax and yet keep your mind thinking all the time. Can't wait to get into it farther.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In this sad world today I am so thankful I have found this series. This series will not only keep you on the edge of your seat but will make your heart very glad with the ending of each episode for every season. You owe it to yourself to see all the glamor, and, heartheak and joy this family carries with grace and dignity. And please do begin with Season one. I am so happy I have found this wonderful story. It makes me feel so very happy. What a wonderful series.
B008JFUMT2|4.0|My husband really wanted to see \\"A Good Day To Die Hard' and I agreed to it for Valentine's Day.  He appeared to like the action scenes and the theme of having Bruce Willis team up with his son while strengthening the father and son bond.  I actually agree with this, but there was one caveat that I did not agree with in the film. The bad guy and his daughter were also paired together to fight the protagonists.  The actor and actress did their job well in the villain parts, but I feel that creating a bad guy with his son would have gave the movie a less misogynistic spin.  Other than the caveat, \\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\" is a decent action film.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I really liked the movie. I bought it for my  nephew. It was a Christmas present. he was really happy.
0385536828|3.0|At first I was hooked. The characters evolved and pulled me into their situations, their emotions and their lives. Even when the story took a turn, I was ready to get more involved and was ready for just about anything. Anything, that is, except Cold War History 790.  I gladly inserted my bookmark. At the next reading, after admittedly skipping the lectures, I was rather hooked again, etc., etc., until I finally got frustrated and thought what the heck, and scanned most of the rest, especially the lectures. I have nothing against Cold War history - I've studied it, taught it and even lived in it, but this account made me feel rather cornered and jerked around. I did read the end. My last thought was, \\"Oh, good grief. All that for this?\\" I am gladly done. My grade on the exam would be a thankful D+.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Great read. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in those that have served our country.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to learn and much like original solitaire. Something I can play in the evenings to get my mind off of a stressful workday.
B008HK3RVY|5.0|High quality - the kindle seems really protected in this case. If you are looking for a sleeve-type case , then this one would serve you well.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Frankly, I don't think I'd own a Kindle without this product.  It has been used, and jostled about, and travelled with almost every day for the past two months and it shows not a bit of wear.  Best of all, the Kindle never gets loose from its mooring.  All the ports, switches and speakers are easily accessible, so it never needs to be removed from its case.  The strap that holds the case closed is a nice addition also, especially when travelling.  All in all this is a well-thought out product that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.<br /><br />If you don't like the color purple, there are several other choices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game. The controls are super simple to learn, but despite the simplicity, the game remains a challenge ad you continue to play. The fast-paced action means you'll never get bored and the various power-ups act as mini rewards as you work on the objectives. If you enjoyed the first Temple Run, this sequel will not disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is defiently a awesome sequal to temple run. imagini should make a subway surfers 2 and it would be awesome
B000001ESF|5.0|Its a in your face, smash mouth, Rock n Roll album(cd).This is the music I grew up with.Love that it was remastered.This is the album(cd) that firmly established Rush as a  musical force of genius.Brought back many memories.....support your favorite artists.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is just amazing. I started reading it and I've been hooked ever since. I have one thing to say to Charlie. And that is \\"You are infinite.\\" This book is inspirational towards all America. I really want to hear how Charlie is doing. So write a sequel please!!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Will this movie win an Oscar?  No.  Is it full of thought-provoking, heart-wrenching drama?  Of course not.  Is it fun?  DEFINITELY!  While some of the characters are a bit over the top (like Beca's roommate, or the leader of the Treble Makers...who actually behaves like that in real life and still has friends?), I laughed until I cried (literally) while listening to the character known as Fat Amy, who steals the show.  The music really was great (having been in chorus, I'm a sucker for great harmony) and I love how Beca mixed older tunes with newer ones.  Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!
8866130915|5.0|I generally like moleskin products and this is no exception. Enough room to write my events and the notes page on the side of each date gives me room to scribble down notes. The stickers that come along are nice. A nice buy!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey Seasons 1 and 2 CDs were good quality.  We enjoyed watching them immensely and would recommend them to anybody interested in the life of the rich during the Edwardian era.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Throw together pointless violence, wannabe Tarantino-esq blood, the voice over of a girl with the acting prowess of a 13 year old, a pointless dream sequence, and you get this turd of a movie. Don't waste your time.
0525952926|4.0|This is the middle book of the author's \\"Century Trilogy\\", a saga tracking the lives of five families from five different countries, as in the first entry \\"Fall of Giants\\". While that initial volume took place during WWI, not surprisingly, this one spanned WWII, including a few years prior to and following that great conflict. Because most of the action centered around Nazi Germany, and all the ensuing horrors, not to mention the military slaughters during the war per se, much of the topical matter was pretty gruesome, including the deaths of many characters of whom we had grown fond from the earlier tome.<br /><br />That said, Follett's writing and story telling are just as fine as before; and his tale served again to illuminate many of the social and political ills of the day, ending with the rise of Communist Russia, a fanaticism almost as bad as Nazism. Unlike the debate about America entering WWI, there was no doubt what would happen after the attack on Pearl Harbor - and the rush of the super powers to develop the atomic bomb, and we know who won that race initially.<br /><br />So like a legion of other readers, we eagerly await the third and final installment of what should be close to a compelling, 3000-page tale!

B001BKVWYG|2.0|As with the soundtrack for Sugarman, I found this to be inconsistant and over all a disappointment.  the artist is much more interesting than his music and I can see why he chose to be 'under the radar' and I do admire him for that....
B0000048CX|5.0|When this first came out, my reaction was &#34;WTF?&#34;.  It quickly grew on me and entered my list of all-time-favorite off-beat records.  YLT has always never been shy about showcasing other people's songs that they really like, and this is a whole album's worth.  I think it was their version of Speeding Motorcycle that first got me to appreciate the songs of Daniel Johnson.  Writing this after seeing them in NYC the previous night, where they finished with Yellow Sarong, another great cover song from this album.  Highly recommended, especially for Sunday mornings and any other time when you want something laid back.

0316044695|4.0|I have read several recent books published by Navy Seals who were snipers.  This book stands above the rest because it has 3 strong pillars:  a compelling and amazing story, clear and honest insight into US operations in Afghanistan and training of Navy Seals.
B008NQYWC0|4.0|I don't know what Einstein would made of a time traveler spending five years in the past with utter disregard for the \\"butterfly effect,\\" but suspend your disbelief and you'll be OK. The book is really overwritten in places, as are a lot of King's later works. However, the story is compelling, with strong characters and nostalgic detail of a bygone era. And nobody can deny that stopping the Kennedy assassination is an intriguing topic.<br />I give King credit for acknowledging the late Jack Finney, author of Time and Again, the single best time travel book of all time. King obviously studied Finney's book (and probably its sequel, \\"From Time to Time\\"), and I feel that this novel is a tribute to Finney in many ways.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The end could have been bette.<br />The author kept the reader engaged.<br />I think I'm going to read the book for a second time. I did enjoy it.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|The book was real interesting seeing the inside ways to remember hundreds of things in a certain order.  In the end the author didn't use but a couple techniques in everyday life.  That tells me too much effort must be used for day to day details to be committed to memory permanently.  The brain seems unlimited in its use.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Normally I'm not a fan of games that use the position sensors, because they always seem overly sensitive to the angle at which I hold my device. This game is a pleasant surprise, in that it is still quite controllable no matter how I hold my phone. The game is challenging but simple in its rules.
0374214913|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  Although I did get it from the library, it's a must-have so I'll be purchasing my own copy.  The book starts out in a sort of mundane way, but the mystery that is the 24-Hour bookstore quickly peeks through the main character's routine existence.  It reminded me of what an incredible journey a good book is, and how much wonderment there is still in the world.  Read this! You won't be sorry!
B0055N0FZM|5.0|I had no idea of what to expect when I bought this book on Kindle. I was expecting something childish, and lots of cribbing and crying. What I got instead, is the writings of a young girl who seemed to be intelligent and mature beyond her years. There were times, I must confess, when I found the book a little trying, but on the whole, what a rush. This book is full of LIFE. Anne Frank certainly seemed to be so aware not only of external events, but even of herself. The writing style is so clear and uninhibited, and the words just seem to flow from her pen. She had a great eye, great clarity of thought, and managed to keep up her optimism despite being holed up in the Secret Annexe for so many years. It is a tragedy that her life was cut off, and that her body was dumped in a mass grave. Who betrayed them? He killed her body yes, but the girl lives on.<br /><br />What she teaches us really, is to value LIFE, and to take joy in it. I live in a country where there is much strife. I hope my country men can read this book and learn from it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book was written as if Mark was speaking right at you. The book narrates Cubans personality, and I must say it is refreshing because Mark Cuban has a great personality. Great and inspirational read.
030788743X|4.0|Even if you don't pick up all the pop-culture references rooted in the 1980's, you'll still enjoy this book. But it does help if you have first-hand knowledge of what Ernest Cline references...<br /><br />Readable, clever, and incredibly enjoyable, Ready Player One is a great book. Even my husband, who doesn't make time to *read* many fiction books these days (he listens to audiobooks when he has time) got immersed in this book. It's definitely a must-read for kids/teens of the 1980's and it makes you realize what a unique situation we all were in to be around for the advent of video gaming and media related to the \\"personal electronics era\\", even though at the time it didn't seem quite as cool as it *really* was, when you think back on it.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|The Grey\\" is the most idiotic and pathetic wolf-demonizing movie I've ever seen but to go as far as to feed the cast with wolf meat it's beyond words. One might expect Liam Neeson would have known better... what a shame... :(
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|my 9 year old grandson like to build lego houses, he loved these doors and windows because they open and close.
0765325950|3.0|I've been reading the Wheel series for years now -- admittedly with some enjoyment even while realizing that Jordan was creating a plot morass.  I have to admire Sanderson for taking on the extremely difficult job of bringing it to any sort of conclusion.  That being said,  Memory of Light is basically one long battle story which ends in a less-than-satisfying fizzle.<br /><br />Good series -- but Volume 14 just doesn't meet the expectations you came away with after Volume 1.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Excellent.  John Cory is irrepressible and irreverent.  First the Lion and now the panther.  Is there another big feline in the works?

B007V4530A|5.0|Short and concise. Must read for any presenter who wants to connect with their audience. Review for seasoned ones and recommended for new presenters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought that this was the usual teenage romance with the usual angst, but the story turned out to be so unexpected, I was honestly shocked as things unfolded.  A bit sexual in nature, which points to a more mature audience, but not the sort of sexuality that is gratuitous. Great story, and reminds the reader that coincidences are sometimes the pieces of destiny falling into place.<br /><br />Very recommended.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It is pretty, I had a hard time figuring out how to get it to stand up.  It does not have a pocket of any kind and I wish it did.

B00005YJMX|5.0|This movie is really something special. What I like to say is that it's not my favorite version of Dracula, but it's probably my favorite Vampire movie. What I mean by that is that it is definitely a very unique adaption of Dracula, basically a remake of the first (unauthorized) film adaption of the Dracula story, the silent film Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror, and it's very much interprets the Dracula story in a very distinct way that is not like the iconic story we've come to know. In many ways I think it recognizes aspects of what Dracula truly was that no other adaption has personified. But it's also more of a \\"retelling\\" than a straight adaption, as much it's own thing as it is a Dracula story. What makes it brilliant is that here we have a vampire that is absolutely creepy and yet you don't run away from him and he creeps on you very slowly and yet you don't jump away, you're just sort of frozen there, fascinated and terrified. It's the opposite of what I hate about horror movies, it's all ambiance and the horror is even more devastating without the shrieking. It's the personification of what the vampire is, if not the personification of what we expect from a Dracula film (the perfect Dracula film is still yet to be made).<br /><br />I very much recommend the two disc edition by Anchor Bay. They shot the speaking roles of this movie both in English and in German. Both are great and I like being able to watch a movie in my own language without a dubbing or looking at the subtitles. But the actors definitely seem to be a little more natural in their own language (the German version). I consider both versions legitimate versions (which I don't extend to dubbing) and after I watched one, not knowing what to expect, I then put on the other just fascinated with picking up the nuances I might have missed in the other version.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie highly enough, unless you just want the same old modern formula movie, in which case you really shouldn't ever take any of my recommendations.

B001FB4W02|5.0|Having already collected the entire series on DVD up until season 8, I switched over to Blu Ray for seasons 9 & 10. The picture quality was so great I had to pick this up as an upgrade for this season. And having waited until they dropped below $20 was a major score and couldn't pass up the deal. Now, if they can just reformat seasons 1-5 and release the entire series in HD, that would be great! I totally miss this show on TV. An absolute high point in the Superman saga and the genre's presence on TV in general. Pick it up if the price is right.

B008220BLG|5.0|This is perhaps the oddest adaptation of Romeo and Juliet to date. The names \\"R\\" (Nicholas Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer) should clue you in. The film starts out with first person narration from \\"R\\", a zombie. He let's us know he can not connect with people, the theme of the film that zombies are simply people who have lost their connection to other people. If they can regain that connection, they can be cured or at any rate, not smell as bad.<br /><br />In this tale \\"R\\" consumes the brains of Julie's boyfriend and gains his memory. This starts a platonic relationship where they protect each other from each other's world. \\"R\\" is a horder who lives in a plane. Julie's dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of zombie killers. The introduction of young kids with pseudo patriotic themes is a satire of the \\"Red Dawn\\" movies.<br /><br />There are some questions that arise.<br />1) How do the skeletons, i.e. \\"bonies\\" stay together without falling apart?<br />2) How does a record player operate after 8 years into a zombie apocalypse with no electricity?<br />3) How does a person see their own face in their own memory?<br /><br />This is a fun film, that drags at times. Will be a welcomed addition to my zombie film collection when it comes out. Almost a prequel to \\"Fido.\\"<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: No sex or nudity. Zombie Rob Corddry whispers the F-bomb near the end of the film.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|I loved this movie, which is a re-setting and re-telling of the 1984 &#34;Karate Kid&#34;.  Jackie Chan, known more for his comedy kung-fu and his acrobatic stunts, turned in a GREAT dramatic performance.  Young Jaden Smith is a chip off the old block:  the son of Jada Plinkett Smith and Will Smith, he obviously inherited talent from both parents and has talent beyond his age.  The movie will have many cheering at the end.  The EXCELLENT score by James Horner adds to the overall product and is a work of art on its own.

B0063IH60K|3.0|The solitaire game itself works well.  The issue is that an ad is displayed after EVERY game.  I realize they're being payed just for displaying the ad link but it's a little excessive. Odesys also makes a free solitaire game but the ads are displayed along the side of the playing area.  Either way the player is subjected to far too many ads for a free game app.

B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I have always been a fan of the John Hughes movies like The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Pretty In Pink and saw a lot of people suggesting that Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the book and directed the movie for \\"Perks Of Being A Wallflower\\" was this generations John Hughes.  While you can't really make that assessment on one movie, \\"Perks\\" is certainly a great start.<br /><br />You can read the Amazon description to get a story synopsis, I don't think that needs to be covered again.  \\"Perks\\" does a great job of telling the story and making the characters believable.  You feel like you get to know them, and their flaws, as the story unfolds.  The main character Charlie is dealing with some very serious issues in his life, some expressed early in the film and some towards the end, and Chbosky takes us on the roller coaster of emotions that he goes through dealing with all of them.<br /><br />The movie has a stellar cast and a just as stellar soundtrack.  Highly recommended.
B008CRC506|5.0|Fantastic show but really wish they released it on BLU RAY! Maybe if enough people \\"like\\" this post, studio executives will release it!
B0086449YA|4.0|With \\"Privateering\\", Mark Knopfler releases his 1st solo double-album & his 7th solo release, overall. Both cd's clock in at 45 minutes each, which provides the listener with over 90 minutes of well-crafted, subtle, tunes that scan the range from blues, folk, Celtic to traditional roots-like tunes done in his relaxed, fingerstyle, picking that Knopfler followers have come to know & love. Each cd contains 10 tunes & delivers special treasures at the price of a single cd. In addition to fronting the band Dire Straits from 1977 to 1995, Knopfler has also scored music for 8 films. The prolific Knopfler's last release was 2009's \\"Get Lucky\\" & he continues his musical journey with many of the same musicians that backed him in that fine release. \\"Privateering\\" expands his sound even more with fiddle, cittern, pipes, accordian, and most notably mouth harp as provided by Kim Wilson from The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Other musicians include Tim O'Brien on mandolin, John Mccusker on fiddle, Mike McGoldrick on whistles & pipes, & Paul Franklin on pedal steel. Knopfler also produced the release with assistance from Guy Fletcher. As I noted, there are 20 tunes and there is no filler, whatsoever, in the long release. Songs just seem to flow into one another providing a reflective, relaxing mood that Knopfler fans know & love. Highlights include \\"Haul Away\\", the bluesy \\"Don't Forget Your Hat\\", the title track \\"Privateering\\", which sounds like a timeless sea shanty, \\"Hot Or What\\", \\"Corned Beef City\\", the Celtic-flavored \\"Kingdom Of Gold\\", the NYC ode \\"Radio City Serenade\\", \\"Gator Blood\\", which feature tasty slide licks, \\"Bluebird\\", \\"Blood And Water\\", and \\"Today Is Okay\\", which features mouth harp by Kim Wilson. The songs also get stronger with each playing and one can simply re-play both cd's over & over and discover new riches with each playing. Mr. Knopfler once again proves to be both a songwriter and musician of exceptional merit. Take the journey with Mark. You will be quite entertained. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son loves this game. He has all the movies. My husband even plays it on his phone. when my son can't play on my Kindle he fights his Daddy for the phone.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I think that all of Tom's books at the top of their class. I would like to read all of them
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I feel like I need to preface this by saying the trailer of this movie made me want to read the book.  Also, you should know that this review will contain SPOILERS, so do not continue reading if you don't want to know why this movie doesn't do the book justice.<br /><br />When I first saw the movie trailer, I thought to myself it looked like something I would enjoy since I really liked the Twilight series, and I initially saw it as \\"Twilight except with witches\\"... errr... \\"Casters\\".  Since the movie opening was a month away, it left me plenty of time to read the book.  I really enjoyed reading [[ASIN:0316042676 Beautiful Creatures]] and read the entire book (all 550+ pages) very quickly.<br /><br />I knew I'd want to see this movie as soon as I could, so I was sure to make it a showing opening weekend.<br /><br />Overall, I REALLY did not like the movie.  I do not feel the movie even scraped the surface of the book.  It was more of a hollow shell of the literary version.  I understand that with movies you have to keep it brief because at most you have about two and a half hours to communicate the story, but this movie really butchered what was an otherwise good and entertaining story.  Having to cram several hundred pages into 2 hours is definitely a feat, but it's been done before and even done WELL before, so that is not even a great excuse for the filmmakers in this case.<br /><br />Things I did not like about the movie:<br />* There was little-to-no character development and the pace was much too quick.  From the very beginning, the movie starts at a grueling pace and doesn't even give the audience a chance to soak information in and decide for themselves who these people are or what to make of the story or events.  I felt like key scenes or story lines from the book were left out that would have improved the character development exponentially.<br /><br />*To piggy-back on the lack of character development, there was absolutely no connection whatsoever betweenLena and Ethan.  They are supposed to have such a strong emotional connection that they have dreamt about each other even before meeting each other (these dreams parlay into the following 3 books in the series), and they are supposed to even be able to telepathically talk to each other (which builds in the second story where Lena starts to shut Ethan out and he is left hurt).  This movie basically introduced the characters to each other, and then suddenly they love each other.<br /><br />*MAJOR character changes:<br />-Ethan's Mom - Though deceased, Ethan's Mother is supposed to be a very pivotal character throughout the series.  She was a Caster Librarian and a genealogical expert which is important to the overall story.  Here, she is mentioned once... maybe twice and that is it.<br /><br />-Larkin in the book is a Dark Caster who is actually using his power of illusion to make himself look like a Light Caster.  In the end of the literary version, it becomes apparent to the Duchannes that Larkin has actually been fooling them all this time and had betrayed the family.  This parlays into Book 2 ([[ASIN:0316126365 Beautiful Darkness]]) where Lena drives Larkin's car because she can't bear to drive Macon's old car anymore and this leaves Ethan puzzled how she could be in something that belonged to the cousin that betrayed her and her family.  In the movie version however, Larkin is just a nice Light Caster who helped Lena in the end against Sarafine. (Did they seriously just do that?)  This is one of the biggest ones that bothered me because the feeling of betrayal is a powerful human emotion.  It reaches into your gut and pulls your insides out.  There was such a great opportunity to make the audience FEEL something, and the film makers did not capitalize on that at all.<br /><br />-Ethan's Dad was pretty much nonexistent in the movie.  I don't even think they cast an actor to play his dad?  Having read the book, I understand why he was in his study all the time, but people who haven't read the book will never know why.  I believe that in the book, Ethan's dad played a role in Ethan's character development... his emotional being that we never got to see in the movie.  We all know that Ethan lost his mom, but the audience is not given the opportunity to feel sorry for him because he might lose his dad too (Events in the book that included his dad towards the end were omitted from the movie).  Although his role was a small role in the book, I felt it was important nonetheless and it's a shame his character got cut out entirely of the movie.<br /><br />- Marian / Amma - In the film version, Marian's character was consolidated with Amma, and thus eliminated from the movie.  Again, I felt this made the story feel rushed... they didn't have enough for Amma in the movie so they made her librarian too.  Even with Marian's elimination, Amma's character was very one-dimensional.  She didn't do things that she did in the book like give the Wate family \\"charms\\" to ward against evil or anything.  She just mentioned a few times that she was a Seer, so I guess the audience was supposed to just take her word for it.  Character development for Amma left a lot to be desired.  The ending of the movie was also disappointing because in the end, Amma should have been there to try to help Lena, but the ending was changed (I'll get to that soon).<br /><br />- Mrs. Lincoln / Sarafine - The movie also consolidated Mrs. Lincoln and Sarafine into one character which completely blew my mind.  Although I know in the book it turned out that Sarafine was using Mrs. Lincoln's body, the movie made it seem like Mrs. Lincoln actually WAS Sarafine the entire time.  I couldn't understand why they did that, other than because they didn't know how to create that scene at the end where Sarafine \\"steps out\\" of Mrs. Lincoln's skin. It can't be that hard, could it? I'm sure the special effects nowadays could have done the job.<br /><br />- Boo Radley - Why did they haveto get rid of the dog in the movie?! Did they forget that \\"caster animals\\" play a bit of an important role in the second story?<br /><br />- The Greats - I guess Amma didn't need The Greats in the BC movie series because Lena saved the world by casting that spell on Ethan so he would forget her.  How in the world are the filmmakers going to introduce The Greats later on when they play important roles in helping Amma, Ethan & Lena in the other stories?<br /><br />- The Sisters - Ethan's Great-Aunts were nowhere to be found in the Beautiful Creatures movie.  If the producers intend to use them to finish off the BC movie series, they are going to have a heck of a time introducing them (and the Greats, and the fact that Boo and the cat have magical seeing abilities, and...)<br /><br />MAJOR Plot changes:<br /><br />- Guardian Angels - The \\"Guardian Angels\\" in the book were eliminated. Although I don't think this was a HUGE deal, it was disappointing that the \\"Guardian Angels\\" were eliminated from the movie version.  In the book, I felt it really developed the characters of the girls (Emily, Savannah, etc), and emphasized the fact that Lena was basically being persecuted for no reason other than being from out of town and different.  The \\"club\\" also played a part in the end of the book where Link wore a ripped up Guardian Angels shirt at Lena's Surprise party (more on that later...) because it offered up a bit of irony they they were all at Lena's birthday party when they campaigned against her just days before.  In the movie version, the only \\"character development\\" that the girls got were lines that started with \\"My mama said....\\".  Cliche'.<br /><br />- Winter Dance / Ridley's return - The Winter Dance in the book served a purpose, in my opinion, because Lena wanted so badly to just be normal and do normal teenage things like go to the high school dance.  The dance also developed the characters of the mean high school girls and reintroduced Ridley and showed the book's audience what she was capable of.  In the book, the incident at the Winter Dance is what made them have that \\"hearing\\" about getting Lena expelled from school and not just the window breaking.  The winter dance and everything that happened there was completely eliminated from the film.<br /><br />- Breaking the Curse / Spell on Ethan- In the movie, Lena finds a cure to the curse that she shares with Amma, but doesn't tell Ethan.  How anti-climatic. In the novel, there is not a way to break the curse.  This was a pretty significant shift from the book.  In the movie, She also decided to put a spell on Ethan so that he forgets they ever loved each other because it would save him from being hurt and from being brought further into their world.  I was actually pretty shocked that the authors agreed to let them shift so significantly because nothing NEAR this happened in the book.<br /><br />- The Book of Moons - The Book of Moons is really significant in the book series -- all the way to the very end of the last novel.  In the movie however, it's simply used as a Caster encyclopedia where she finds a cure to the curse.  Yawn.<br /><br />- Lena's Birthday Party / The Ending - The book had such a completely different ending than the ending in the movie.  The book involved an elaborate plan including a surprise birthday party that was Ridley's idea to separate Lena and Ethan.  That didn't happen in the movie.  The ending was extremely different than the novel.  In the movie, Ethan is separated from Lena because he just doesn't remember them ever being together and Macon uses Larkin's illusion powers to make himself look like Ethan so that he can thwart Sarafine's plans.  After the anti-climatic scene where Lena realizes it is actually her uncle that is dead, Sarafine/Mrs. Lincoln has this weird out of body experience and Lena looks pretty evil.  The book was much better at creating tension and suspense during this scene, so this scene was such a let-down.  The movie scene was basically just a gun-shot and Uncle Macon telling Lena to \\"Claim Yourself\\".<br /><br />Before the credits roll, there is a message that tells the audience 6 months had passed, and there is a scene in the library where Ethan comes to let Amma know he is going to NY with Link to look at colleges.  Ethan briefly talks to Lena making casual chit-chat and leaves.  He drives off with Link and as he is about to leave Gaitlin, he stops and screams her name like he suddenly remembers everything.  Link also doesn't seem phased at all that 6 months ago he actually shot Lena's uncle.  (Explain that one to me!?!)<br /><br />I need to point out that my review of the movie is not based on how it deviated from the book (which was definitely a bummer), but to point out how the movie lacked a lot of key elements to make it a good stand-alone story.  The plot was rushed and sloppy, the characters were one-dimensional at best, and it was basically a giant small Southern town cliche with some spells sprinkled in for good measure.  Had all the right elements been in place, I would have enjoyed the movie even if differed from the book.<br /><br />In the end, the filmmakers took all the magic and mystery out of the novel.  They spoon-fed the audience the very basic elements of the story, and didn't allow the audience to experience what could have been a really great, magical journey.  The movie offered no suspense or conflict at all.  I would highly recommend reading the book, however, I would also recommend skipping the movie because it was such a major disappointment.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I am amazed how the story line was able to work backwards in time and fill in a lot of information on the relationship between Agent K and Agent J.  This was an excellent sequel to the series.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|A pretty good book but melville drags everything out. Could have cut out about 200 pages. Mayday was a bit better paced but still a little drawn out
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Being a huge John Grisham and Lisa Gardner fan, when a friend of mine suggested this book I immediately bought it as I had just finished reading Lisa gardener's Catch Me (which is excellent, by the way). I honestly feel like I've wasted my time with this book.<br />The beginning was somewhat interesting, but towards the end it seems as if the writer didn't know how to finish the story, where to take the characters. When I read the last sentence (which by the time I didn't know was the last sentence), I turned the page to make sure there wasn't another chapter!<br />I don't recommend this book, unless you enjoy being left to your imagination. There are several more interesting books out there.

1846551455|4.0|This printing is long overdue I'm sure may of us english readers have been wondering when this story would finally become available to us. If your a fan there wasn't really any surprises and by that I mean the book was well written and at the end there was pretty of information that made you feel as though your suspicions were right on then to have the twist that you didn't see coming cause you to be surprisingly surprised at the end. The book also showed how Nesbo has grown in his abilities as a writer which makes one appreciate his efforts to be one of the best at what he does.I am a fan and to see the author's skill increase makes me appreciate his commitment to his craft and his readers. Keep them coming.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was excellent.can't wait to read next One .I give it a 4 star rating<br />. And recommend it to read
1599218011|2.0|I Did enjoy the book and the diet she outlines sounds good, it is just that she is an actress not someone that has been taught (maybe a benifit?? who knows) about the ins and outs of what makes a body work well. I didn't find it super informative but like I said it is a good read. She has a funny style.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and I could play it all day I'm only 8 and I play it at late night sometimes anyway this game is awesome GET THIS APP
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easy, addictive, and fun. If you like temple run, you will enjoy this game. The characters are cute and the boards are cool.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love my Dragon Story game, it too like most of the TeamLave games are great however overpriced in the cost of things for it.  But for a free app I love it and play it every day.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Tried this app to see if our home wireless would be secure enough to stand up to simple hacks. It is not a utility, but a worthless gimmick. They owe me 5 minutes of my life back! Too bad, zero stars is not an option.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was more spellbound n the beginning of this trilogy, then at the end of it.  I was dreaming and fantastic at the beginning, but towards the end, I was actually getting kind of bored...like she was grabbing random ideas to write about just so there was filler content. And now it just looks like future books are going to be from hos point of view....so.  repeat of all the info.........bleh.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I have never watched Mad Men but heard lots about how good it is, so we shall see. Haven't watched it yet, but it arrived promptly and in good condition.
B0080K3G4O|3.0|This was a solid survey that wa  well-researched and filled with personal explorations that th  autho  took to pursue his concept.  Definitely, this  book was more philosophical in its discourse as the  title implies.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game rocks if u dont have this game get it its the bomb its boring at first but then it gets better
B004TI5N38|3.0|Could have been a flashback Jack Reacher story.<br />They even have the same first name.<br />Same body count.<br />Same heroine.
B00008973A|5.0|I have always love Chorus Line - glad to have the DVD at a reasonable price. It arrived quickly and in good shape
0307720950|5.0|Anderson offers a terrific introduction to the maker movement. More importantly, he lays out a reasonable framework for the transformation of American manufacturing. In the book, he discusses the history of the movement, the tools that are helping to fuel the transformation, and his vision for its future. I've started referencing this book in my Entrepreneurship course to demonstrate to my college seniors a practical way forward, as they start their own ventures.
B0088ETCHW|4.0|I liked this.  It was a good read and understanding certain terms in the sport of swimming.  I especially enjoyed the different types of swimming techniques and how they actually enhance or disadvantage one's speed.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a ok book. It didn't end the way I would've liked which is why I have it for instead of five stars.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|If you liked the books, you won't be disappointed by the movie. They did a good job of staying true to the books message and plot line. Definitely recommend it for any fan.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|I played this originally back in the arcades during the 80's, it quickly became my top return-to game. Eventually I managed to get a copy for the Spectrum 48k and loved it - though it was a far cry from the arcade original.<br /><br />Jump forward a few decades and I played the XBox remake. It was very close to the original, but I felt something was missing.  However the android version tops the lot! Really nice.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have the infinite mode found on iOS.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|ITS ALOT OF FUN I DON'T READ ALONG FOR MOST OF THE STORYLINE BUT WHAT I HAVE READ ITS INTERESTING BUT ALOT OF FUN ANYWAYS.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am freaking crying right now and I think it was the ending that got to me and I cried I never want this to end :(
B009NOVCTM|4.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas and love how quick I received it before the holidays. Was a hit as a gift.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've heard a lot about this series and finally decided to jump on board with everyone else.  It's a quick read and keeps you interested.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I made the mistake watching the movie before reading this, but all I can say is I'm very happy that not a lot was different between the two. It was most definitely a great read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome I play it on my xbox and when I'm done I play on the kindle I just cant stop playing
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|good concept, addictively fun...<br /><br />i play this as a &#34;time passer&#34; on the train to work.  i usually don't find many &#34;turn-based&#34; mobile games that also has good graphics and uses minimal battery life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is addicting!  Couldn't put the books down.  The only book that I wasn't crazy about was the final book in the series- I feel it was a little rushed.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A real feel good movie.  Great dialog between some of the characters.  Especially funny for us older watchers. Clint Eastwood seems to like to produce and star in movies that focus on relationships between fathers and daughters.  Watched it twice.
0316286869|5.0|I am a complete makeup junkie and love kevin aucoins work but to be honest while this is a good read it is very basic. If you already are comfortable applying makeup then you will probably already know most of whats in this book. Also the looks are very neutral and all seem to use liquid eyeshadow which I am not a big fan of. But lets be real for a minute...Its kevin Aucoin people!!! So it still is a must have for my collection. If you are looking for the 1 book that will give more in depth application info and cover all your needs then I recommend Rae Morris makeup:The ultimate Guide...Its the BEST one out there!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is probably my favorite season (and my favorite Doctor)<br />The pairing of David Tennant and Catherine Tate is a non-stop laugh. The chemistry is brilliant between them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've heard a lot about this series and finally decided to jump on board with everyone else.  It's a quick read and keeps you interested.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is a straight forward action flick that gets straight to the point unlike the older goofy version with Stallone. In this movie, Dredd is really Dredd. The viewer will never see his face without his helmet, just as in the comic that inspired this movie. The drug gang in this movie is really sick and adds to the dark atmosphere. I just wish this movie gave a little more background on how Dredd became the way he is. It is too bad this movie was a flop because maybe a sequel could've gone more in depth with his character. Hopefully, the home video sales can help make up for the box office losses and get us a sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so additing and I love it so much and my sister loves it to .I really think some father person has to try it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is addicting!  Couldn't put the books down.  The only book that I wasn't crazy about was the final book in the series- I feel it was a little rushed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George Martin has my heart in his grip. He holds it in his hand and I am at his mercy.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I love this game. It's a lot like Mario bros but with a couple small differences. Overall a very fun game. I am on the last level, but the game wont let me climb the walls to get to the wizard. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. PLEASE fix.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is addicting!  Couldn't put the books down.  The only book that I wasn't crazy about was the final book in the series- I feel it was a little rushed.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The pilot episode is amazing and left me wanting more. I can't wait to continue this series. I will have to own this.
B008YCMM2A|3.0|These are indeed great performances by one of my favorites periods of Miles' music. However, there is no excuse for the sound presented from the July 25 1969 Antibes concert. I have the exact same concert in VASTLY better sound on the 1993 CD release in Japan on Sony SRCS 6843 called \\"1969 Miles- Festiva de Juan Pins\\". Just how is it that Sony Music presented a seriously substandard version of this concert for this box set when Sony Music Japan had a much better source for their 1993 CD release. Shoddy vault research job!<br /><br />On the brighter side, the November concert sounds excellent and the video is aces all the way!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|In this game, you steer a fish around the screen with tilt control.<br />You gain health by eating food (the white splotches) and lose health by contact with oil slick (goo).<br />There are several tasks and many levels that earn you stars. With enough stars, you unlock the arcade level.<br />It's basically hungry sharks with an angry birds scoring system.<br />The game is good and the controls easy but what I don't like is that it's extremely hard to earn any stars in clear the ring levels.<br />It's worth keeping though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun game that I am in love with. I was playing it and my brother comes in and sees me playing it. He put it on his kindle them my mom did then my sister, and so on. My whole family is addicted. Get the game now!

B0090XO57C|5.0|This series will give you a perspective on how beautiful our world really is. It should inspire everyone who sees it to help keep it that way.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This product is a cheap knock off!  The screen was bubbling and separating upon receiving and the gray trim is hard plastic and not rubberized unlike the real lifeproof case.  Not worth the money!!!!!!!
0385536828|3.0|There were some aspects of Sweet Tooth that I really enjoyed, particularly the description of what was happening in the UK in 1973 and the goings on within MI5, but ultimately I didn't care about these characters, or their motivations.  Sweet Tooth is based on a sleight of hand and I think that the concept rather overshadowed the characters in this case.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best app ever since the past few weeks because I have not stopped playing it ever since I downloaded it because of how great it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|The theme of the book was pretty good. It had many funny pictures that made it more enjoyable. Very funny.
0446547573|5.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks book!  If you're fan than you'll love it, if you haven't tried any of his books, and you love contemporary adult books, that the most romantic thing you will ever read, then he is the author for you! I've read almost all of his, and just love them all! :)    Here's my full review:  [...]
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Don't get me wrong here - I like them, and their appearance here certainly spices up this set - but perhaps the Stones' most important contribution here is their appearance itself. Without that, we probably would not have this filmed document at all. But, thankfully, we do. And what we have is the undisputed king of Chicago Blues, with his band, playing virtually at ground zero of the blues world, the Checkerboard Lounge on the South Side. This is a stunning document of the power of Chicago Blues in all it's raw glory, and perhaps the best film of authentic blues music I have ever seen (with the possible exception of some segments of the American Folk Blues Festival releases). Incredible!
B009YQJ322|5.0|An excellent way to reboot Dredd, a must for anyone who loves Dredd from the comic books, a must see
0307454568|4.0|This is the third of these books that I have read and I really enjoy them.  Too bad there won't be anymore.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Lacuna Coil is amazing. This album does not disappoint. If you have never heard these people play. Check them out.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|A Clash of Kings is not my favorite book in the Ice and Fire saga, in fact besides A Feast for Crows it is the weakest book in the series, even still I was excited about this season of Game of Thrones. The first season had its problems, namely it had a hard time keeping tension and intrigue like the book did, but it succeeded greatly for the most part. So now season 2, and I am happy to say I was not disappointed. Season 2 took some initiative and decided to stray away from the books a bit. This worked for it splendidly at some parts and hurt it at others. The story of Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, and Sansa all benefited from the changes. It stayed loyal to the books overall, but the small changes really made them stand out. Theon Greyjoy was also a great character this season and season 2 really made his story work out. Characters like Jon Snow and Arya Stark, however, were more of a mixed package. The problem with Jon Snow is not the writing, it was the performances. Kit Harrington is a terrible Jon and really has a lifeless performance the entire way through. I was constantly bored by his travels through the North and was all the more disappointed that they cut some of the amazing chase scenes in the end of the book for some forced Ygritte/Jon shipping. Arya's story in season 2 was exciting, and I was never bored for a moment during her time on screen, however, much of the character development she had during book 2 was not present here. Clash of Kings was all about Arya losing her identity, and season 2 did not show that in any way. Also there were a few cheesy chase scenes that were unneeded. The biggest disappointed for season 2 was Daenerys. Her entire plot was rushed and convoluted. I knew that they would have to stray from the books with her (she has like 4 POVs)but her entire plot was laughable. We got no developments for the politics of Quarth and I didnt know why I should care with what was happening on screen. Worst of all, Dany turned into a one dimensional little bitch. Despite these grievances, season 2 worked out. I was happy how they portrayed their new characters (Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre) and Margaery Tyrell was a gem on screen. Overall I would give this season a 4/5. Here is hoping they succeed with season 3.
1594200823|5.0|This book tells the truth about farms, the cycle life of a farm animal and organic farming. I did not know we use corn in everything. This book tells it all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app for the Kindle fire. Best of all IT'S FREE!!! I highly reccomend this for every Kindle fire User.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is a great installment to the series, in my personal opinion. Though the plot progression is lacking, it has amazing world building and character development. Many of the characters grow much and more and it makes me very excited for the final two installments. I also feel like all the build up and tension within this book will make the final two books in the series even better. If you are a person who is more into the plot oriented side to this series, then this book is not for you but if you are in for it the political intrigue, characters, and world building then pick up Dance with Dragons right away!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love it! Perry is my hero and this is a great game that anyone can play. Good for anyone
B004LROUNG|5.0|If you love John Grisham you'll love this story.  David Zinc is fed up with the Big Box Law Firm he works for and joins a hole-in-the-wall law firm and learns the hard way about the pitfalls of major tort cases.  Zinc ends up a hero, nevertheless.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|It is a good movie for just plain action without any major acting breakthroughs! You will have fun with it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is what I wish glee was like.<br /><br />I love this movie and I've watched it 3 times already. Fat amy is so funny so even if you don't like singing, watch it for some laughs. The music is also really good and the acting is great.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I am not a huge sci-fi fan, but found this movie really enjoyable. It kept me going all the through, and I would highly recommend it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book! The Mitch Rapp series keeps you engaged and entertained. Definitely worth reading them all. Vince Flynn does a very good job of storytelling.
0195067142|5.0|Can't complain about this one. Of the better written WWII books in my opinion. Puts a new light on what Sledge went though along with the HBO series. Highly recommend it!
0062238310|5.0|I purchased this book on pre-order after my Downton binge after watching the finale of Season 3 (UK time). I was elated when it finally arrived and dove into it almost immediate because I needed a Downton Fix. Yes, I realize how silly I sound. This script hit the spot and even exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I love the way this script is formatted, it runs alongside the series and if scenes were moved around, they are moved around in the script as well so you aren't confused. There are extra scenes included and are easily spotted by a small sidebar alongside it. In addition, there are comments about certain scenes through the book as well as a backstories behind the history of the times and why they did what, even confession a few mistakes they made. There are a few plots that become a bit clearer, including the one that befuddled me the most - what exactly DID Pamuk and Mary do? That answer was worth the book cost alone! Maybe I'm just stupid but I was always wondering how far they went and that is all answered here. Well, I think. LOL<br /><br />Definitely pick this book up if you are a fan of Downton Abbey. Now if only Season 2's script wasn't SO far off in the distance!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It doesn't get any better than the first book, in fact I am tempted to say that it gets a little repetitive. Still good though, shouldn't have trouble getting through it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really fun little game; it could eat up hours if I let it.  Isn't at all buggy and very easy to play.
1400049628|3.0|This 'book' is fun to have, makes a good conversation piece, but not something that you are going to dwell on.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|Two stars because the actors (except for Brad Pitt) did a magnificent job with a poor story and an unpassable script.  There are so many errors and weirdnesses both visually and plot-wise that make it difficult to do anything more than smear this whole film.  It was supposedly filmed in Germany and France for a pricetag of 70 million dollars -- yeah, right.  Who had the honeymoon?  Everything shown on screen could just as well have been an old MGM backlot -- there were scenes in Paris... okay... you could have fooled me.  No shots of the city, the Eiffel Tower, nothing.  Germany?  Aside from a room displaying a map of Fortress Europe and a prison cell that looked more like a zoo, we saw nothing of Germany or Berlin.  Granted, the cinematography with what WAS shown was expertly done, but... if I was filming a tale in Washington, D.C. or New York City, would I not want at least a few passing shots of buildings and such?  Or am I being too demanding?  So... cancel my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Story starts supposedly on a dairy farm.  Okay... not a cow in sight, but plenty of milk to go around.  The farmer is chopping his axe on a stump presumably for splitting wood -- there was nothing on the stump.  And if he was trying to get rid of the stump, he wasn't chopping at it correctly.  The actor did a wonderful job -- don't get me wrong -- all of them did (except for Brad Pitt who phoned in his part) -- it's the DIRECTOR that should be slapped.  And to quote another reviewer, the scenes went on and on and on... and on.  And hiding a family under the floor of your one-room shack?  Really?  In the crawl space?  This late in the war?  The script grows grey hair as an SS officer takes his time to eventually comment on the cleverness of humans, then just shoots through the floor to kill them.  If this SS man was this vindictive, willing to spend 15 minutes interrogating a farmer, demonstrating his patience and desire to menace Jews and farmers in a languid fashion, why then the quick trigger?  Drag the Jews out and have more fun menacing them!  Not consistent character response.  And this late in the war, SS and Gestapo were not exactly patient.<br /><br />As for Brad Pitt and his ridiculous accent -- a mangle of Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, and who knows what else -- myself a resident of the Great Smoky Mountains, let's just say &#34;we are not amused.&#34;  And part Apache?  What?  Cherokee occupy these mountains!  Cherokee did the scalping as demanded by their French allies who wanted proof of all the kills.<br /><br />The gore was overdone and unnecessary -- scalping was gruesome and almost silly.  Skin isn't going to come off like a piece of latex stuck to an actor's head... which is what it was... yeah.  In one long scene, we are subjected to an interrogation of a prisoner with a scalped victim in the background -- the bloody view does not change -- blood does trickle and change color.  So... too gory and inaccurate.  If you enjoy watching necks being sliced and bullets at point-blank range blasting men's crotches, and foreheads being gouged merrily, then this piece of garbage is for you.  I don't call this entertainment.<br /><br />As for the script, it didn't seem to know what and where it was going -- one part is the cinema fire plot, the other is this ridiculous squad of murderous soldiers that do nothing to advance the first story.  And how would a twisted Southern accent survive sneaking around Fortress Europe populated with highly suspicious and paranoid Nazis?  Or break into a high-security prison?  Especially with a too-long, drawn out scene of a Gestapo officer interrogating and testing a German with a suspicious accent?  No, no, and no again!<br /><br />One delight was seeing Rod Taylor as Churchill -- a nice surprise and, as is usual for Rod, excellent performance in a very brief appearance.<br /><br />As for Hitler dressed in white tabard (cape), the actor did a wonderful job, but the scene was stupid.  Hitler, first off, wouldn't have given a damn about a squad of infiltrators 'terrorizing' his soldiers in France.  His focus was on the Eastern Front and the developing Western Front.  He would not have been dressed as such -- he dressed simply.  He would not have been alone in a conference room with just one other character.  He would not have gone to a film premiere in Paris with Allies already on the beaches of Normandy!  Not, not, not, not!  Totally wrong.<br /><br />The cinema-owner's father was killed in the blitzkrieg?  Was he in England?  Paris did not suffer the blitzkrieg.  Invaded and occupied, yes!  Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Great acting, scenes too long, wildly distorted history, lousy script, unbelievable characters, no panoramic candy (Paris, Berlin, London -- if they were really there), and a lousy interpretation by Brad Pitt.  One star because there is no score of NO stars, and one star for the actors who, I say again, did a great job.  To the director, go play with your gory comic books and crayons.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I wouldn't say that it is better than the book, but still a great movie. At first I was kind of hesitant towards the casting choices, but everything came together as the movie developed. Highly recommend to anyone, whether you have read the book or not.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a fast read. It was better than the movie! I'm excited to read the next book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From a male prospective it is still a good book. I don't read THAT many books, let alone steamy romance novels, but I made it through without any problems. It got me through a deployment. : )
B004SBQGHS|5.0|As expected - fun game.  Happily paid 99 cents for the ad-free version.  Decent numbers of levels - didn't beat it in one sitting like some other games.
0307346609|4.0|Maybe not worth five stars, but still the best zombie book that you are going to find. I can't wait for the movie! The story is told in an odd fashion, it may turn some people off, but still very good.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Love this series!  Can be a bit bloody or sexually explicit.  I like the on-going story lines and have become invested in all of the characters.  Can be predictable at times though.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I started this book. I got it because my sister-in-law kept telling me to read the trilogy.I really enjoyed reading this book. The story line kept me interested and there were a couple of nights I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed.  Great read!
B006VRDZ44|5.0|Love this series!  Find the prohibition era setting interesting.  Well-developed characters.  Good balance between having a lot going on but remaining easy to follow - like the perfect number of characters and time spent developing each one.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is definitely the most important book! The one full if twists and turns and decisions! One caster girl must make the decision for life! Imagine only getting to make one decision and never getting to change it. If you have two options and the power to change things, might as well find a loop hole:) I recommend this to everyone:)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|As expected - fun game.  Happily paid 99 cents for the ad-free version.  Decent numbers of levels - didn't beat it in one sitting like some other games.
B00338QENI|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read a book in one sitting. I couldn't put this down. Everyone should read this book. Everyone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This entire series provides for excellent entertainment and is very well written, produced, and filmed. The historical accuracy and authentic settings make for a very enjoyable viewing experience!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Seriously this app locks up when viewing photo and doesn't allow me to change new feed settings.  I thought the IPhone FB was disappointing but at least it's livable!  Don't waste your time just Mark FB as Favorite on your Web app and go from there.
1423140605|5.0|Bought this book for my Grandson, he loves these book and he can't wait until the next ones come out.
B0053O89Z6|3.0|Wow how have the mighty fallen, this season is a massive step down from previous seasons. Season 6 was not upto par with the previous seasons but still reasonable however season 7 is a new low and at this rate they are gonna get cancelled.<br /><br />This season truely makes Ted look like a complete loser as he is desperately chasing girls he's already been with and the show's producers run through the ted and robin & barney and robin thing yet again, a sure sign the original ideas are definately drying up.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I can literally write a paper for school anywhere I am and save it to my drop box. The integration is so cool.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is great! I love the theme and meaning behind this. Great movie from Japan! If you get the chance watch it!
1455502626|5.0|He's a great writer in general but what makes this book cool and unique is that the character in this novel (and about 6 others of DeMille's) is John Corey, a wise cracking, NYC detective who is hilarious, witty, smart and fun to follow around.  Highly recommend this book!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I hadn't heard of this show before seeing it on Amazon.  Weird stories with great delivery and the characters are well played.  I am really enjoying the shows.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I came across this movie while surfing my cable tv on demand/pay per view. The fact that it was produced and directed by David Grohl made me curious since I'm a big Nirvana and Foo Fighters fan. I had never heard about Sound City before and this music/documentary was utterly amazing. It gives a nice historical perspective on an important time in rock and roll history. The story telling is woven between the founder and employees of Sound City and the significant artists that performed there. Kudos to David Grohl for saving the Neve board and letting it's life continue. He does a nice job of blending the performers careers and their relationship in the story of the life of Sound City. This is a MUST SEE for all true rock and roll fans. I can't wait to get the new sound track album.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series has an outstanding story line, incredible photography, and wonderful attention to the &#34;period&#34; details.  Don't wait to absorb the entire season!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I bought this DVD used and was very nervous it would be scratched or just an awful DVD b/c like I said, it's used. To my surprise it is in perfect condition!  Very very pleased and my 2 year old little girl just loves to watch it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard from friends this was an excellent show/series and it is.  Why I waited this long to find out I don't know but I have been watching each season via Amazon Prime to get caught up with the rest of the world.  Don't wait on this one!
1932735410|4.0|This book is useful when preparing for the PMP exam. It does a fairly good job of making PMBOK subjects more understandable.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|People rave on about Bronte, Austen and Dickens all the time. I'm sure that one day, Du Maurier will be up there with the best of them. People seem to forget the power of Du Maurier's works.<br />Rebecca is an amazing novel that will grab you by the throat and drag you along for the whole, terrible ride. The way Du Maurier writes is so vivid that you can almost feel the craziness going on around you.<br />If you liked Rebecca, I recommend Frenchman's Creek as well.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I keep thinking that it's going to get stupid or contradict itself or write itself into a corner but it somehow manages to stay fresh and interesting.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This brings it all together: John, Jane and Zoe on a new planet fighting for their colony.  I'll miss the OLD MANS series.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is fun and awesome it is totally like Mario Lep is so cute this is a perfect app for children
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|If you are tired of the app crashing when you move back and fourth between devices because of the lack of an updated version on the kindle fire edition do this:<br />SIDELOAD your paid version onto the fire.  I just did it and it works great.  It's not that hard and you are not doing anything wrong.  There is a really good step by step at tested-dot-com called how to sideload Android apps on the Amazon Kindle Fire.  What you end up with is a version of the app that would be on a generic Android tablet like a Samsung.  Goodbye Ads, goodbye crashes.  It also works great with Word With Friends although the horizontal interface was surprising.  Now I've got all the upgrades I already paid for and no ads!  Sideload, learn how to do it.  Once you get it set up it's a breeze.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Merlin: The Complete Fourth Season is everything you could have wanted from this series. My only complaint would be that there were not as many special features as previous seasons had. I really missed the episode by episode 15 minute behind the scenes &#34;The Magic of Merlin&#34; like previous seasons had, and the video of them at San Diego ComicCon. Watching the special features is as important to me as watching the show because I treasure the interactions shown between the cast members. Other than this though, it's great to finally have the boxed set of this season in my hands.
1569242739|5.0|I adore these cupcakes!!! You will not be disappointed from these delicious recipes. So moist and flavorful.  I used ygr basic vanilla cupcake recipe and added some vegan chocolate chips. They were absolutely the best cupcakes. Buy the book if you like to bake! And even if you aren't a baker..the recipes are easy to follow!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Although this book was better than the first book, I still have not read the third book because I refuse to pay for it.  I am waiting for lady at my job to finish it and then I will borrow it just so I can finish the series.  Never Again!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A small insight into the life of a great American hero and the sacrifices and challenges he faced.  Highly recommend.
B00969GFFU|4.0|I really enjoyed the character studies in this novel.  Had a hard time putting it down.  And I did enjoy it more than \\"The Corrections\\" (where I lost interest 2/3 of the way through).
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was very hesitant to start this book. I downloaded a copy via the Kindle lending library thinking that The Hunger Games would turn out to be another Twilight -- supremely terrible writing/plot and a waste of time. I have no shame admitting that I was so incredibly wrong! THG is a very easy read because the story is engaging, smartly (and appropriately) written and full of social and political commentary. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awesome better than origanal<br />Wow awesome game gigantic monkey. k love it the best game ever hope they come out with number 3
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I choose this rating because it's a great book.<br />I loved everything about the book, just wish I could get my husband to do some of the romantic stuff. Can't wait to start reading the final book.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone that's interested in these types of things ;)
B007REV4YI|1.0|Daniel Craig portrays Bond as a depressed loser. Bond is now Batman and Silva was the Joker. This movie was full of plot holes - Bond gets shot, falls hundreds of feet off the top of a moving boxcar  into a raging river, gets swept hundreds of feet down a waterfall, and is shown sinking, unconscious, 50 ft.below the surface...and we next see him in bed with a Turkish woman, sipping a Heineken....That's enough for me...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|There was nothing that I did not like about this book!!! Once, I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It's full of love, excitement, mystery, and surprise. I'd recommend this to anyone!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Has some lag but is increasingliy fun! Very addicting and would suggest to any and every one! Alot better then the first.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Okay.  Like many of you, I'm sure, I watched the first two seasons on HBO and just couldn't wait.  Boy, does this book deliver!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Don't get me wrong it's a fun game, and would get five stars. BUT it slows down the Kindle and has lots of lag. it even makes it freeze or shut off sometimes.
B00A655N8I|5.0|This just arrived yesterday, just finished listening to it, and I have to say that I liked it a lot. What a treat, a 21st Century Die Walküre that is actually vocally glamorous. Before everyone jumps on me, let me say that this is not necessarily the best Die Walküre on records, but it´s good, and the singing gives genuine pleasure. First and foremost, Jonas Kaufmann´s virile, individual and charismatically sung Siegmund. This is the real thing, a star performance, the phrasing is clear and generous, the tone is opulent, and most important, the rapport with Sieglinde is sincere and palpable. His Sieglinde, Anja Kampe, also has what it takes, I saw her as Jenufa and thought her very moving, her Sieglinde is vulnerable but true, the voice shines like a laser beam next to Kaufmann´s. The Russian Hunding, Mikhail Petrenko, has a fine voice, but others have had a more menacing personality. René Pape, the Wotan, could have sung a better Hunding than him, but here he essays the god king. His is obviously a great voice, and although he has the range for the role, the color of the voice is more dark basso than bass-baritone, still there´s dignity in his interpretation. Nina Stemme´s Brünnhilde is in the Hildegard Behrens mould, not as large scaled as Nilsson, but feminine and touching. This is also a star-quality performance, and compared with the precarious singing of Deborah Voigt´s MET Brünnhilde, she is quite simply in a different class.<br />This is Gergiev´s second Wagner recording from St. Petersburg. His Parsifal was surprisingly good, but Die Walküre is even better. Now the Mariinsky´s orchestra sounds more German, the brass more stylish and under better control, and Gergiev, though no Furtwängler, isn´t nearly as bad as some others say.<br />From the pictures in the booklet we know that there were concert performances, though the recording itself doesn´t sound \\"live\\". This is an all-around very satisfying version, and in these sad days, when greatWagner singers are very hard to find, this is indeed a treat.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|My daughters enjoyed this game, playing on every day. They had almost all the characters.  This morning they went to play on it, and all their work was deleted. They were very disappointed.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|As far a Gregory's books go, this is one of my least favorites.  I find that Anne's character lacks depth, substance and consistency.  I know very little is known about her, but she comes across as being a bit wishy-washy, and it makes her dilemma about the two princess less than credible.  Nothing compared to the character development of Catherine of Aragon in The Constant Princess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to keep your reflexes honed. I really like playing this during my down time.  Makes a road trip a lot faster as well!
031620157X|5.0|My copy didn't come with the map, a downside even though the map can be downloaded easily. The story can be enjoyed easily by listening, but reading is another source of pleasure.<br /><br />The story was composed quite while, yet it is still meant for kids since one can't push for logic too deep. Well, who will search for rocket science in a fairy tale.<br /><br />This book will become a movie someday, but what worries me is how could others do fairy tales any more? This book covers too many famous tales and leaves no room for others: all the most told stories are tangled into the story line.
B001RPD06I|5.0|I could ask for anything better a 16gb sd card for cheap love it I would recommend ppl to buy things from here
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an excellent story.  You find yourself living or feeling for Katie.  Nicholas Sparks hit another homerun with this book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It's better than the others from graphics to the difficulties and it even has a mod if you were red and green 3D glasses it will be 3D
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A little long (I think because I saw the show) but such a great cast of characters... Very complex exploration of good and evil... Honor and duty... Love and fear...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are only two books that come to mind when I think of how much I enjoyed them AND how much I cried while reading them. The first one is Bridges of Madison County, the second, The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, the young people in this book are impossibly brilliant, as evidenced by their unlikely dialogue. But it doesn't matter, because the characters and story are so engaging and interesting, you just want to keep reading. The prose is well written, almost too well written, as I had to look up new vocabulary words fairly often. But I don't profess to be a genius and I like a book that challenges my intellect. This book is categorized as &#34;young adult fiction.&#34; My young adult daughter encouraged me to read it and I'm glad I did. Just keep the tissues handy.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I didnt really have high expectations for this movie. I love Rebel Wilson, so I gave it a shot; and I am so glad I did. The movie is amazing! It is funny, and a has a little bit of romance in there too!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought this movie on a whim, both because it was a dog movie and it featured Richard Gere.  I expected a cute movie and was delighted to find so much more.<br /><br />I expected it would be either a tear jerker or a heart warming movie from the opening...  The origin of the puppy Hachi, to his mishap which led to Richard finding him, to the boy at school giving a report on his hero, a dog named Hachi.<br /><br />I think only a dog lover can truly appreciate this movie.  Our standard poodle has brought so much love into our lives, and that experience has made this movie even more real.<br /><br />I found out later that the movie is based on a true story.  The history is beautiful. The intelligence in Hachi is an wonderful example of the unique nature of dogs.<br /><br />I loved everything about this movie....
0765325950|5.0|Taking over 20 years to fully publish, the &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; saga by Jordan has finally concluded. Brandon Sanderson, using Jordan's draft, has tied up all the loose ends, and written an exciting finale. Not everyone will like the details, or the fate of all the characters, but there is no denying the consistency of the story line, or the fleshing out of personalities. Great job!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I've been a Josh Groban fan since he hit the music world.  This is just another addition to my collection and I love it!  Great sounds and well, what more can I say?  IF YOU LOVE JOSH GROBAN, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I could only find one or two brands of stylus with small tips, but they were a little pricy. this is a great value.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This album is one that is timeless! I love Pink Floyd and this particular album is one of my faves. And, the best part?  Prices for this and other albums, CD's and DVD's are awesome at Amazon!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved this book as much as the first one. I do not understand why certain reviewers felt katness was selfish and selfcentered.  I thought she was just the opposite.  I did wonder why there seemed to be a lesser amount of gore and killing. But the shocking ending explained a lot. I cannot wait to get my hands on the third book. I would recomend to everyone who likes fastpaced  adventure books except the young people who might be too immature to handle the killings. Let's all pray we never have to  live in a place like this or a government like the capital..
B008IJT0CE|3.0|not what i through it was don't get it i have not used it but once now not sure i would recommend it

1439153663|5.0|This book is a good read - the characters are well developed and the narrative keeps you wanting to read more.  The topic is disturbing, but it is very well written.
0547848412|2.0|The concept and most of the narrative comes from a book written 10 years earlier by Scliar. Many people think that Martell only copied the previous work. I think his writing made for a more interesting book. Any way it is plagiarism.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|My husband and I couldn't wait to see this movie, so with pop corn in hand and feet up we watched it and enjoyed it very much
B005LAIHTA|4.0|\\"Katie\\", a girl escaping from her violent past, hides away in a small seaside village where she meets Alex and his two children who are trying to get over his wife's death from cancer.  Katie immediately connects with them, and also a girl who is her neighbour in the community.  She gets a waitress job and buys a rustic cabin away from the village.  There she is able to re-evaluate what is important and discover a safe haven away from her troubled life.<br /><br />As usual Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint and I quite enjoyed this latest offering about second chances.  First of all it is a beautiful love story and the romantic chemistry between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is very intense.  It is also a suspenseful thriller and I will try not to spoil it for anyone by telling too much as the whole point of a thriller is that you don't know what happens, lol. I do find the film a bit slow in places which balance out the suspenseful and violent parts of the story which at times are hard to watch. Setting the mood with beautiful scenery and touching moments really adds to the development of the love story, which you feel like you are living yourself.  The acting is very good and also David Lyons does an excellent job of playing the cop turned bad who is stalking her.<br /><br />There is very little swearing in this movie but there is a bit of vulgar language as well as two uses of \\"For C's Sake\\". Also, the fact that the main characters engage in sex outside the marriage relationship will be offensive to some.  As a Catholic Christian, Nicholas Sparks often puts a Christian symbol in his stories, but I did not notice that this time.  I haven't read the book, but I gather the antagonist in the book quotes scripture a lot, based on the discussion questions at the back of movie edition version of the novel.  However, this is not something I noticed while watching the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend this film, despite its imperfections.  I feel the symbolism of the desk is that true love stands the test of time and will last forever.  That's really what this movie is about...finding true love and getting a second chance at life.desk is that true love stands the test of time and will last forever.

0143120530|5.0|a little history, a little autobiography, a little technique on memory improving. its basically about the year joshua spent training for the US memory championship and what he learned and the friends he met along the way. quick, interesting read.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Can't get our money back from ordering streaming so don't make the same mistake. This movie starts out with raunch. Sorry i didn't check rating for nudity and sex. Thought it was rated R for violent crash scene and gore. Big mistake.

B001S6PMY4|5.0|Julie Taymor set out to recreat t968 with its social framework of free-love and the Vietnam war using the rich catalog of Beatles music for source material. Taymor adjusts some to the original arrangements, but remains true to the orignals providing balance and energy creating a movie that is captivating in story and in song. The rapid pace of the story is maintained by performances of the central young stars Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, flowing from scene to scene supported by Carol Woods and Joe Anderson. Early Beatlemania is captured by Sturgess in &#34;All My Loving&#34; and Wood's &#34;It Won't Be Long,&#34; Eddie Izzard's ebullient scene &#34;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&#34; is reported to have been the product of several edited improvisations, while U2's Bono and Edge bring new vision and flair to &#34;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&#34;  Joe Cocker is great as a pimp in his rendition of  &#34;Come Together&#34;. Dana Fuchs is incredible, a singer who is too late for the younger generation to appreciate, she brings incredible fire to 'Helter Skelter&#34; then cools with ice and a tropical breeze for her melodic chants in &#34;Dear Prudence&#34;. But my favorite song after &#34;Dear Prudence&#34; is  Wood's great interpretations of Paul McCartney's &#34;Blackbird&#34;. So much more could be said of this time machine film but its best that you watch it and decided for yourself.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this is cool because we get to<br />fight other robot.dude you have<br />to play real steel.you have to<br />see this.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Okay, not the Beatles but the music, a collection of songs done by young artist and well named ones who play characters in a movie story using Beatle's songs to tell the story and name the characters. After seeing the movie you have to get this album. Joe Cocker is great as a pimp in his rendition of  &#34;Come Together&#34;. Bono brings new life to &#34;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&#34;. Dana Fuchs is incredible, a singer who is too late for the younger generation to appreciate, she brings incredible fire to 'Helter Skelter&#34; then cools with ice and a tropical breeze for her melodic chants in &#34;Dear Prudence&#34;. So much more could be said of this time machine album, yet I feel ending this review must be reserved for Evan Rachel Wood who sings one of the greatest of all time interpretations ever presented of Paul McCartney's &#34;Blackbird&#34;.
B000FA675C|3.0|Interesting yarn! The author blended a fascinating mix of fact and fiction. I hope he continues his work in the future
0062238868|1.0|If you're looking for an action-packed military book filled with fascinating anecdotes and gritty insights, keep looking. This book is positive proof that being a good sniper does not make a person a decent writer. The book is mostly about how macho the author is, how he'd gladly die for his country, but he enjoys killing for his country a whole lot more. Maybe the lack of interesting description about his various missions is related to a need to be unemotional if you're going to be a sniper, I don't know. This is just a boring book, very poorly written. Reading it is a total waste of time.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Always wanted an aquarium. Now I have one without these work and the fish tell me what to buy. Spend hours relaxing.

0790729407|5.0|Great movie about the famous Irish Revolutionary leader Michael Collins. It's very memorable and makes a legend into a flesh and bone man. It doesn't paint a glorification of him but makes him human. It neither glorifies or demonizes but brings a fresh air of realism to the larger than life man affectionately known as &#34;The Big Fella.&#34;<br />  5/5 great movie
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its ok but I think the mines r hard but its a really fun game I would get it since it is free!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is great. I love the fact that they keep coming out with new sounds that are available for free download. It also makes for a great alarm clock.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Such an original story! Love the action. Clean enough for little ones to be in the same room with us while we watch it.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|An excellent way to relax.  It takes enough mental thought to cause me to forget about the day and simply relax.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is a quirky, fun movie.  Great for us book nerd/writer types.  And fun for others too.  I especially love the guitar store scene and Professor Hilbert and Harold's exchange about finding out what story Harold's not in to find out what story he's in.  &#34;Aren't you relieved to know you're not a Gollum?&#34;

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I got this so I could put my Ipad2 out on the tv for video watching. It worked great. I also tried it with an Iphone4 and 4s and it works well too.<br /><br />It does NOT work with the 30 pin to lightning adapter. you have to get the new cable for that. I did and it works well too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love mazes, puzzles, and any type of games you have to think to complete.  My daughter introduced me to this game - as she does most of the aps I play... and I have been hooked ever since.  I have this game on my Kindle, my phone AND my iPad.  I have it with me where ever I go.  It's a great way to pass the time and a great way to keep yourself from sleeping at night.<br /><br />You have to connect all the same colored dots without the lines crossing over one another.  The first few levels are easy to breeze through, but once you get to the 10x14 puzzles, I would suggest playing on the Kindle or another tablet.  It is REALLY easy to mess up your perfect score because you fat fingered the puzzle and your line goes somewhere you don't want just because the grid gets REALLY tiny on anything other than the Kindle Fire or a tablet.
B001IF252M|5.0|I got this for my 2009 MBP to be able to output to older projectors. It does its job very well and if VGA is what you need then this is the adapter for you. It also works with my sisters 2010 MBP.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was addicted to Temple Run - and then this one came out.  When I just need a quick break from work, kids, or just need something to help me unwind before bed, I know I can have fun for a while with this game.  The graphics on this are amazing for an ap.  I was shocked to see it after playing the first Temple Run game.  In this one, you get to swing down ropes, ride in carts, jump over spiky wheels of death and  twist and turn through gorgeous scenery.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Well-developed characters plus an engaging, intriguing, fast-paced plot...I couldn't put it down until I finished. Well worth the money spent and sleep lost.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The trio of characters at the core of &#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; befriend us with their joys and sorrows. The coming of age story is elegantly told from the vantage point of the aspiring writer, Charlie, that by the end of the movie you want to pick up the phone and call the Sams, Patricks, and even Charlies from your adolescence. The more well known cinematic roles from the actors' careers never overshadow the unique voices they deliver in this movie. Like me, you'll find yourself sitting back and being a wallflower with them.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|A fun read for those who like a blend of mystery, fantasy, technology and books! A bit of a sappy ending, but it was still a page turner.
1936850028|5.0|Skiing just is not my cup of tea.  Of course, when served with charm, humor, and poignant human experiences, even what one may consider the most mundane of subjects - whatever the subject is - can be served up on a platter and served to the most judicious of book enthusiasts.<br /><br />People, I am not a converted man where skiing is concerned, but I have seen something of the light.  The mood I was left with by the end of this book: delighted and pleasantly surprised.  I will tell you why in a moment.<br /><br />First, an overview.<br /><br />\\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" is a recounting of the author Walter Rhein's experience with the famed American Birkebeiner cross-country skiing race.  It begins with an explanation of just what, exactly, the American Birkebeiner is, along with a word from ski-legend and Birkie founder, David Landgraf.  Chapter I begins a satisfyingly humorous journey of self-discovery.  From the small town of Belleville, Wisconsin to an international excursion on the Worldloppett Circuit, Walter weaves a wonderful tale of pushing through the pain and the literal remaking of himself, a gripping story of failure and triumph, of hope in the face of overwhelming odds, and of working from the ground up to achieve what you want to achieve.<br /><br />King's View<br />When I saw that \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" was about skiing, I was very sure that I was not going to enjoy it.  Even so, I already informed the author that I was getting to work on reading it so that I may review it.  As I made my way through the introduction and David Landgraf's accounting of the first Birkie, my apprehension grew.  What could I possibly enjoy about skiing?  Even worse, what could I enjoy about cross-country skiing?  My answer: nothing at all.<br /><br />Still I read on and, by the second page of the first chapter, Walter's recollections of himself as a 7 or 8 year old and his first skiing experience had already pulled from my throat a much heartfelt, though grudging, laugh.  I had judged Walter's work too soon.  Even though I was enthralled with the cover art, reading a book about skiing did not appear anywhere on the mental bucket list I keep.  Of course, Walter proved my prejudgment an error, and much to my enjoyment.  In short, I actually loved reading this book and I am willing to bet that you will, too.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First, while I was not overly fond of the introduction, it did provide a firm foundation for my understanding of the American Birkebeiner and that helped hugely because I had no idea such a sporting event existed.  It was just right to put into perspective the prominence of the Birkie, thus giving the rest of the story sturdy legs to stand upon.<br /><br />One thing I came to admire about Walter's writing is that, even as I take his approach to setting building as something of a minimalist approach, he was able to transport me to where he was.  Having an aversion to the cold, most of \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" had me shivering some, enhancing my want for hot coffee as I read.  With attention paid to the emotions evoked by the setting and the interactions of the various characters, Walter did an excellent job of capturing, and keeping, my attention.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about how witty this book is.  From the antics of his grandfather - such as giving a couple of Austrian Berkie participants lessons on what not to do when driving on ice - to the daring of two long-training Birkie hopefuls finally making their way into the first wave of participants, becoming \\"real skiers\\" and subsequently demanding a sponsorship that should have gone the other way because of their approach, this work is full of moments that will have even the most persistent of humbugs rolling on the floor laughing.  The quote I found most humorous: \\"I even listened to Rush Limbaugh for company for about five seconds before I realized silence was more profound.\\"<br /><br />The fascinating thing about Walter's book his how, in the course ofreading, I began seeing the cards I have been dealt in a different light.  \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" is not simply a story about the author's participation in an event that many of us have likely never heard of; it is a story about making your mark, pushing yourself, accomplishing your dreams even though the steps to get there are as daunting and steep as the hills of the country wherein the Birkie took place.  Walter shows us what we can do when we truly believe in ourselves and when we are willing to dedicate ourselves to our dreams.  It brings to mind a quote from one of my favorite movies, Watchmen: \\"Never compromise, even in the face of Armageddon.\\"<br /><br />Is this book the most intriguing book in the world?  Given my love for the fantasy genre, I would be very hard pressed to say it is.  Even so, I enjoyed this read.  Anybody that can ever be said to have dreamed or set goals to better themselves will be sure to benefit from this book and feel as inspired as I did by the end.  If you ski, I think it goes without saying that you would be doing yourself a service by reading this book.<br /><br />My rating for \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\": 5 Stars out of 5, easily.<br /><br />And the Cover?<br /><br />Admittedly, while I actually find the cover art beautiful, at first I did not believe it meshed well with the contents of the book.  Of course, I came to realize I was wrong.  Cara's execution of this work of art is, in my humble estimation, near flawless.  I only have a technical issue with the cover and that is the text near the bottom of the cover.  Some parts of it blend in with the lines of the illustration.  Of course, I do not think that this in anyway takes away from the efficient creativity of the cover overall.  It fits one of the main themes of the book, the Birkie itself and it is a pleasure to look at.  I honestly believe that, at the very least, those who have an affinity for skiing would be quick to pick up this book just based on the cover.  It may have little effect on those of us who do not know a thing about skiing unless we happen to appreciate cover art, in general.reading, I began seeing the cards I have been dealt in a different light.  \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" is not simply a story about the author's participation in an event that many of us have likely never heard of; it is a story about making your mark, pushing yourself, accomplishing your dreams even though the steps to get there are as daunting and steep as the hills of the country wherein the Birkie took place.

B00914JWSW|5.0|one of her great pieces of music.she will never loss it. a great entertainer and fabbulous voice.she should have more personal appearances.we are lossing too many great singer .
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Could not get videos to play on my Kindle Fire & unfortunately had to remove from my device after repeated at tempts to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just want the polyp on the app to stop harassing me to review the game. it's a good game.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|The plot is their is an assignation of a king by one of his son's, the king has a huge treasure and everybody wants a piece.  There's way too many characters in this movie, and it tires to but backstories in for a lot of these, and they're okay but they take away from the main story.  and if you spend five to ten minutes telling backstories on these characters it just doesn't add up.<br /><br />If you want a movie with a good story don't see this movie, but if want to see a movie with great fight choreography and lots of CGI blood then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />There are good performance by Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, and Byron Mann.  RZA is okay, but he's know leading man, I really care nothing for his character. I liked his backstory but it came way too late in the film, after I stopped caring for him.  The art direction is really good it does a lot with the color red.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie I was so excited to see it, but I was just let down with the story and the way it was told, maybe with a different edit it would be tolerable, but for now it just \\"meh\\".<br /><br />I would recommend certain fight scenes in the movie, and scenes with Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, and Byron Mann, but not the whole movie.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|So many have previously analyzed the movie, its special effects and the acting of Heath Ledger and everyone else involved that I will dispense with creating redundancy and only focus on the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself.<br /><br />There are two discs, the first with the feature film has several extra features showing how many scenes were created, details behind the suit and pod designs and the planning of the film.  The 2nd disc carries on with a very good psychological examination of the mythology and analysis of Batman as a human being displaying his commonalities with all of us.  The extras were really quite interesting and will take a special sitting just to watch them all. This set also came with an Ultra Violet download you can assess via your computer.  I did not attempt to do so however.<br /><br />The Dark Knight on Blu Ray.  I do have the film on Standard Def and it was really quite good, but the video on BluRay definitely surpasses it with a very strong contrast, deep coloration and realistic skin tones.  Even in the many dark scenes there was no disturbing grain or artifacting at all.  The one, very small problem, occurred in the very beginning of the film when there is a panning overhead shot of Gotham City itself.  In one of the vents and windows I did notice some stair stepping.  This lasted but a couple of seconds and is really nit picking on my part and barely worth mentioning.  In my opinion, this film's transfer to Blu Ray is most DEMO worthy.<br /><br />The Dolby True HD 5.1 audio defaults to lossy DD 5.1 when the disc is inserted so be sure to go to the audio setup menu first to change it to the lossless audio.  The lesser compression with Dolby True HD really makes a difference for all Blu Rays in terms of clarity and audio transparency.  It would be a hard pick for me to decide whether the audio or video transfer is the star so lets call it a draw.  The audio is great in all areas using both the front and rear sound stages for panning and quite a bit of discreet channeling and directionality for all 5 channels.  The audio also has some of the deepest bass for your LFE sub channel that you will hear on any Blu Ray disc.  This is especially apparent when the hospital blows up.  If your sub is set up correctly and is not set too high so that you hear it as a separate speaker, you will be immersed in some powerful bottom end.  The audio for this film is totally demo worthy.<br /><br />This is certainly a good BluRay to have in your collection and the cost has come down.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksd quite a bit of discreet channeling and directionality for all 5 channels.

B0042RUMH8|3.0|The only song I really like on this is the one hit on this CD which is actually a cover from an 80s song LA LAMBADA. I actaully like better the original song. JLO could have done better with this CD.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Came on time, exactly as described. My son loves these movies and could care less about bonus features. Much cheaper than buying all three separate. A+
B009CPES4I|3.0|It was entertaining.  Not great but it was pleasant.  Maggie Smith is wonderful.  She plays obnoxious so well - almost too well.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Bought these as a gift for Christmas. Shoes came in on time. They were new in box with everything included. Person who received the shoes loved them!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Totally caught off guard with this book.  Loved all the twist and turns, had a hard time trying to keep up with whose who and what family they belonged to.  Thought more about the book the next day after finishing it and how TRUE society labels people.  My eyes are wide open.  Great start on new writing adventures J.K....
141690977X|5.0|This book is sort of &#34;common sense&#34; but I got insightful info out of it nonetheless. I purchased 2 extra copies for my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome and hey temple run 2 is out! But start off with this if  you are a beginner because the newer one makes this one like a piece of cake which means that temple run 2 is harder
