1476733953|5.0|WOOL is a meticulously crafted world that will wrap you up and carry you along, sometimes against your will, to the dark places in human history yet to come.<br /><br />Hugh Howley's WOOL is a magnificent piece of writing, steeped in mystery and hidden corners, the depths of the human psyche and the desire we all have to understand the world we find ourselves in, to look for meaning where we find it lacking. Written in a series of five novellas, now united in a heavy tome, both literally and figuratively, Howley's New York Times Bestselling Novel is now available in paperback format.<br /><br />We start off with with the end of Holston's story, and the beginning of the mystery of the Silo in which he lives and works with a thousand other souls. We are given to understand this Silo is underground, and a carefully constructed environment, self-sustaining, after an unexplained 'uprising' that forced these last surviving humans underground, away from the toxic air above. Holston's wife was sent out to 'Clean' the Silo's sensors nearly three year's earlier after seemingly going mad, with talk about something that doesn't make sense, a mystery that is driving her in dizzy circles. After years without her, Holston himself makes a decision to join her outside the Silo, to become a Cleaner himself, leaving his position as Sheriff of the Silo now open to another applicant.<br /><br />While we consider the mystery of Holston's choice, we find ourselves on a trek down into the depths of the Silo, as part two of WOOL looks for the individual to fill shoes. We meet the Mayor and the Deputy of the Silo, as they make the long trek down through the levels of the SILO, floors upon floors below, to meet with the candidate they have selected to become the next Sherrif. Juliette, or Jules as she is known, a worker in the Mechanical section of the 'Down Deep' is the pegged applicant of choice, but she is an individual that becomes the catalyst to a number of events and discoveries that change everything for the people of her SILO.<br /><br />The mysteries begin to weave together, thick and tangled, as the momentum of WOOL picks up and carries you to a most shocking ending. Nothing ends as you would have hoped in this stark and unforgiving world crafting with masterful skill by Hugh Howley. How could it, when everything is a lie, and the truth is more dangerous than anyone could have expected. Somehow, the ending is even more satisfying than one could imagine, and yet leaves so many unanswered questions. There is so much to offer in this carefully crafted world, and even more left to the imagination. You can see the story winding and weaving in so many possible directions, and yet it doesn't leave you unsatisfied in the end, just wanted more, as all good books should.<br /><br />This is a novel that is worth the time to tuck in to, and will make you think about issues affecting all of us, in our own lives, right now. It is not preachy, nor blaming, but provocative and engaging, and it will have you winding up and down the stairwells of arguments in your mind, over and over. Is this a bleak prediction of a post-apocalyptic future? Is this a warning about the things that separate us from our neighbors, and prevents us from engaging with those we could gain so much from? Is it a exercise in studying human nature, and our tendency to seek out sanity from chaos? It is all of these things and so much more.<br /><br />While I make this novel sound like some grand study of the human mind, make no mistake. WOOL is meant to be read by fans of science fiction, or post-apocalyptic genre fiction, in it's purest form. It is an enjoyable and fascinating read, but if you wish to go deeper, and if your mind tends to that kind of analysis, you won't be disappointed on either count.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I highly recommend this novel to those who love a good mystery, a thoroughly new science-fiction world, or a post-apocalyptic adventure. There is drama, action, true horror, and at times the most gentle of loving gestures when you might least expect them. There is something wonderful about WOOL that will make is last longer than it's 500+ pages, it will hit you somewhere deep in your sense of being human and fragile, and as human, ultimately capable of both wonderful of terrible things. It is an experience not to be missed.<br /><br />Note: This review of WOOL by Hugh Howley is based upon a copy received through Goodreads First Reads.

B006O6F932|4.0|My daughters absolutely love it. Only problem is that the desks are too small to hold the dolls properly. But that is a manufacturing default, not the item itself.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I've read a number of Brandon Sanderson's books and find them entertaining and offer new and unique worlds to explore.  This book, as the first of the series, doesn't disappoint.  It builds a new world with interesting twists and a mythology to discover.  The only criticism I have of the book is that there are parts that are rather slow.
B003U53GK8|5.0|We started  watching season 1 of Lost in December 2012 and have as of 4/3/2013 we are approximately have way into season 6. We are wondering what we will do when we are finished!!!
B00AFOS9C2|1.0|the DVD box shown is not the opera that the people reviewed.. It's  from an earlier performance with a different cast. I would not make a purchase until<br />this mistake is corrected
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Though Howard Jones is no longer with them, Jesse Leech has really proven his ability to be a headlining musician. By far, it is his best vocal performance. Adam and Joel have outdone themselves by blending the guitars to produce a vaster, more angry tone while keeping it melodic. Justin has made the tracks somewhere around impossible to exactly replicate by the perfection he produced with his drums, and Mike has provided a solid rhythm line. It sounds like classic Killswitch, but with more &#34;P-zazz&#34; as Adam said in the 30 minute documentary that came with this special edition. The bonus tracks are impressive and Jesse pulled off &#34;My Curse&#34; LIVE very well. All around, a great album. Disarm the Descent is worth the money!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Good show, made by lost creator. If you like lost you will probably like this as well. Worth watching, watching other seasons now. Free with prime membership.
B003THHIEM|3.0|Nathan Fillion (the star) is very good, as is his female co-star. But each episode (so far) is close to a repeat of the previous episode. The previous show Fillion was in (Firefly) was far better. Firefly was an excellent show and was very sad to see it cancelled after 14 episodes. The movie Serenity, which was based on Firefly and had the same characters was truly excellent.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|because the soundtrack did not include the Johnny Mathis song Misty, used for the most romantic scene in the movie
B00005NOOH|5.0|Arrived when and how as expected. My husband is a history lover and this was a gift for him. Awesome
1885167776|5.0|Normally, I purchase my books through Amazon, however, I could not wait.  Based on Michael Maher's (7 Levels of Communication)suggestion, I bought the book online from Mr. Keller's website.  I am so happy that I was able to get an advance copy.  What an amazing book!  This book discusses the evils of multitasking, distraction, and scattered focus on the little things.  It has helped me really focus my efforts on what is most important.  This has freed up time in my day, and significantly decreased my \\"to do\\" list, as I now have a \\"must do\\" list and that is the priority.<br /><br />The biggest challenge in the book was finding my ONE THING.  How do you know what your ONE THING is?  Knowing that is as important as knowing your WHY.  Without either, you are a rudderless ship.  I highly recommend this book, not just for sales professionals, but for people who are looking for a higher quality of life.
B009KEN87O|3.0|Fun game but could use more upgrades, and make weapon upgrades permanent. Currently special attacks only last a few seconds, I've gotten several at the end of a level and it resets on each new wave. Very frustrating.
B000W93CXQ|3.0|Enjoyed clay 's journey through the last week's . Suicide is always said to be a selfish act, a d yet this. I'll uncovers so many elements of others actions.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Plus: Dozens of planes, different weapon types, and levels.<br /><br />Con: Slow to level up, sometimes AI is to accurate, that annoy heart that just wont stop moving!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really dont get to play it much because my kids love it. From what little I have got to play it I have really enjoyed it. For a free app it is awesome
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Once you get the word misspellings, you start to realize that everything is happening in a matter of days, but the characters are acting as though it's been weeks.
B001EBWITA|5.0|Oldie but a goodie... Constantine is unique, has action, suspense, and a great cast. A movie that you can watch over and over again.
B000IXUOP0|4.0|It is really nice to find old episodes that we missed and watch them via amazon instant.<br />It is so easy using my amazon library.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|ITS a great game love to play very addictive but it has some quirks...<br />- Bad internet connection<br />- Charged my parents money twice for something I never bought and still never got it in my account<br />- Has an update but won't let me update thus I can't play<br />- Everything is Super expensive took me a month to get the person I wanted<br />- Always let's me down<br />Actually there are more bad things than good things so DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read couldn't put it down. I owe my friends a big thanks for recommending it to me. Can't hardly wait to start the 3rd book. Awesome!!
B0064QNS62|3.0|A fun game for a free app. I uninstalled it after 15 minutes of play because I'd rather play a better game. I got frustrated with this game and didn't care for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This App Is The Best App In The World!!!! I Think Its For All ages! Which Makes It Even Better! I Mean This Game Helps Kids And Family Learn How To Take Care Of Horses And How Much Work It Is.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great movie for the family. Watched it with my grandchildren and they loved it too. Good message about judging others.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the most compelling stories I have read in years, far more than a Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  While other stories have been written using versions of the same premise, none held my attention beyond a few pages.  In the Martian, the protagonist is compelling and highly sympathetic, pacing is well metered and the science is spot on across disciplines.  I eagerly await the next title from Andy Weir!  While it is difficult to compare the works of authors, the Martian is a stunning first work and I hope it is the beginning of a series of books from a very talented (and hopefully prolific) author.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|I love this movie!! So rewarding to see a story with a message and meaning. We need more movies like this.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Acting and story is the best.  Love the chemistry between the characters. This is one I watch over and over.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|When I bought this I thought it was a game it is NOT!!!.  It turned out to be and semi-instruction<br />book a couple of pages and no game... If you see it RUN RUN to another game. It is not worth<br />the money.  You will wonder oh wonder where the game is!!!!!  The product description should<br />state that this is not the game but a brief oh so brief game description...
B009K0P10K|5.0|I like watching this show as it brings out the worst in the rich people circle.  I can just see some of these things happening.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Don't try the string method, break down and buy this! Easy to put together and easy to use. Highly recommend.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|What can you say ... love Charlez Theron and while not a huge fan of the Alien series I thought the premise had hope... nope... The biggest problem is that the characters begin to make assumptions about things for no real reason. I have to think that the pieces that explained what was going on ended up on the cutting room floor .... substitute action for story... not sure but the plot and direction just don't make sense.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|How sad that this sort of thing actually went/goes on anywhere in the world, much less the USA.  But I really enjoyed it up to the end when I thought Ms Grissom copped out--pretty weak...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A wonderful series, totally addicting. Can't wait for the next season. It's historical and entertaining at the same time .Great.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|For some reason, I found it to be quite a page turner.  Parts of it were rather depressing, but the author has a nice rhythm to her writing that makes the reader want to keep on going.  A few twists to keep it interesting...
B000I5X81A|5.0|and loved it all - another of my favourite travelling CDs - great music for blasting out the truck when I'm on a long distance trip.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|inspiring and well done. Historically accurate. A good look at our country wrestling with a problem that the founders left undone.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|and ended up loving them all.  Another one of my travelling CDs - may end up having to get another as they get so much wear and tear....
B000AYEL1A|5.0|what a classic gosh i forgot how much this movie moved me when I was younger<br />I bought this for my 17 year old daughter for her birthday she still hasn't watched it
0143119419|5.0|one of the most amazing books i've ready<br />throughly researched and beautifully written<br />the author couldn't have done a better job
B009S33I68|5.0|Great recounting of  a forgetten battle. . God bless all who served in vietnam in all branches of the military.
B004G6009U|5.0|The case was a little wrinkled, but they said that in the description, and the DVD/Blu-ray was perfectly fine. Also, this is one of the dearest Disney movies EVER.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had the free version and upgraded to the paid version because I liked it so much. I can't sleep with silence or strange noises I might hear like when I travel. have this on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great! It's so easy to layer the sounds to resemble my sound machine at home. I always have it with me when I travel and I sleep soundly.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was a great movie.  It was very exciting and griping and hard to turn away from.  The movie is great and the story it is based on is also amazing.  Although not necessarily historically perfect, it generally tells a tail of a CIA man who made hard choices when his conscious and ethics were in conflict with his government.  I certainly recommend this.
0679805273|5.0|My favorite children's book. I love giving it for graduation gift or new baby gifts.  Someone can enjoy this book at any age.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A lot better than what I thought it would be. Never expected that story line. Can't wait to read the others!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think it was funny when Greg took the camera and flashed Rodrick was getting a hair cut from his mother but Rodrick got Greg back by flopping the dress from his hair cut back and forth on Greg\\"s bed.
B001L63JC8|4.0|I like it. The songs on it are good. The have a good sound to them. Enjoyed -- very much.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|Was just as impressed with this book as I was with Eldest. Great adventure keeps your interest to the end
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a good book with a suprise twist and then another suprise ending. I couldn't put this down. Very good read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So cant wait to read the next one. The characters of Gideon and Eva are so electric. I have to say that I KNEW IT!!! That Gideon is something else.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down! I reccomend it to anyone! It is a quick read and really good! I cannot wait to see the movie now!
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This is a fascinating film, beautifully acted by Emile Hirsch. Ditto for Hal Holbrook as a grandfatherly figure Hirsch meets along the way.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Read it, it is a great book! I recommend it to anyone and it is very thought provoking. Makes you look at life differently.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I had a blast watching this movie! It can get a little corny but the cast of stars shines throughout. It is a pumped up action movie with plenty to like. It's probably better than the first one.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe goes Western (although, in this case, its more to the East).  Well constructed tale set in the world of First Law and The Heros.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used (or should I say) tried many weather apps.  This is by far the best of them all.  It allows me to keep track of weather conditions locally and at cities I am interested in around the world.  The local hourly weather forecasts are more accurate than the local television weathermen.<br />The ability to set notifications and the lifestyle section really come in handy also.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game because there are 100 levels so its something different each level.  It also lets you choose between adventure, tournament and free play.
B008S4YZCO|1.0|It's a free app but you have to purchase, within the game, piles/buckets/sacks/chestfulls of frienstones, crystals and coins at prices ranging from $2 to $20 ($1.99 to $19.99, which shows they are trying to be sneaky).  Not knowing this little tidbit, I let the kid play the game 2 mornings before school then noticed $222.70 in charges from Amazon Digital Services, all related to this little time bomb of a game.  Heck, that was more than the cost of the Kindle Fire itself.  Me and the kid are going to have an intense discussion on this subject.  It makes me consider just getting an inexpensive Paperwhite to read my books and an IPad (with parental controls) for my tablet activities.
B004LDLI0S|4.0|This book truly visited the inner thinking of the tyrant, Adolph Hitler.  It gave us the reasons for all the nasty things he did.
B004IALZUW|5.0|This movie has a well known and diverse cast - Robert Deniro, Madonna, Dustin Hoffman, Jack the kid from Hook, the principal from Back to the Future, etc. Catching the cast in their various disguises is half the fun of the movie.  The cinematography is great - think Sin City in primary colors.  I enjoyed the story, the setting, the music, and the style.  Good movie you may have missed.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Had to read it twice.Actually I wanted to read it twice. I read it a long time ago but when the 2nd book came out I lost track of all the characters. It's a great, fast read.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|Fun comedy that is romantic at times but mostly left me thinking about all the break ups I've had and may have in the future.  Interesting dynamic between the characters discussing love, independence, co-dependence, and friendship.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I purchased No Easy Day the day it was released and could not put it down till I finished.  I then purchased a Kindle gift copy for my friend and he told me the same thing.  Cannot understand all the brouhaha from liberals and misguided progressives about Mark Owen or the book. I give Owens, his publisher, and those who contributed 5 stars...  In addition, my hat goes off to all  the operators who risk their lives so some desk bound politicians can pump their chests on the success of the missions...  Obama did not do it, the Navy SEALS did.  And, do not forget it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game likes to crash and reset u back to the beginning.  Id br really mad if i put $$$$ into it
0307455874|5.0|Read tis book in an English class for school, then read it again for personal pleasure, then bought it as a gift for my brother. It is an amazing story of hope, faith and love. Very inspirational, i recommend it for anyone seeking hope and to be inspired to be great :-)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Esta es una herramienta muy útil, la tengo instalada en varias tablets y cada vez que utilizo cualquiera, el libro que estoy leyendo se abre en la última página leida.  Es excelente.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I Did Not Watch This Show When It Was On Regular T.v. AS A  Series.. I Wish I Had. The StorY Lines Are Fascinating.. Twists And TuRns Keep You Intrigued And DyingTo See What Is Next. I Will Watch The Whole Series Again Someday.
B0095P33IW|3.0|Descent movie but at times was very cheesy.  Doesn't hold a candle to Iron Man.  I liked Captain America better in the avenger movie.
1741812151|5.0|My son loves this book as much as I did growing up.  Just a great concept and well illustrated children's book
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I will recommend any one to buy this movie and it is really cool on 3D. You won't be regret.
B0091REZMW|4.0|lots of adventure and hours of fun. I like how it is frequently updated so there are always new rooms to explore and items to find..
B009MF56GC|5.0|I have the part one, I prefer part two more realistic action then just hear bump, bump, bump every time when they shoot the heavy rifle, too bad Jet Li did not show up too long.
0062014536|3.0|This book I feel is good and sad at the same time. A friend recomended delirium to me and I feel in love with the book. I loved how Alex and Lena fell and love and the book ment alot to me and I also cried at the ending. When I read the last book I was upset that it was over. I feel that the book was great I got angry a few times when Alex was with Coral but then he admited that he was still in love with Lena!! my favrite part... Anyways, I belive there was much more to be said at the end when I read the Ending I had no idea it was the last book. There was so much that they didn't solve and problems that were not adressed. How ever I love the quote at the end about breaking down walls. I still wish that maybe she should write another book there just wasent that closure in the book that you need when you end a series.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Will not change your life.  Might make a good network TV miniseries.  911 nine eleven Federal Reserve is a private company like Nike.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Love this mahjong also, if it is mahjong I will play it.. Play it every day until I get tired and sleepy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and story line. Can't wait to the sequel. They have certainly outdone themselves. I love how the give you an option of finding the objects or playing a card game.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show is hilarious and it is cynical but always ends on a good note. Love this show would Recommend it to anyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must say I've never been a television person - until The Walking Dead! I can't peel myself away from it, and each season gets better and better. I find myself sad that Season 3 has come to an end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great insight and very romantic. It made me cry a little but it was worth it! Gives you a new perspective on dying
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I think Castle is one of the best showes on TV! The characters interact well and they work together perfectly. Glad to see Castle and Beckett get together! I can hardly wait for the next episode!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome game. If you played this game I'm sure you would get addicted (like I did). THANK YOU FOR READING!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The download permitted me to search for specific Books of the Bible and also to search for specific characters.  The reference would list all the verses that contained the search word.  It was great for a Bible study class.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is great. I recommend it to all ages one thing that makes it a little bit frustrating is you wait for coins but you trade prizes for coins. Even if<br />it was $1 I'd buy it.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|I could not put this book down! A story about a fighting a demon, selfless sacrifice and devotion! God Bless Adam Brown and the men of the DEVGRU Team!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is captivating the entire book. I chose it because I enjoy learning through a story and thought I might learn more about the language of flowers. I not only learned more about flowers but a whole lot about foster care in California. To get inside the mind and heart of a forgotten child brought impathy and sympathy and understanding.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this is a game for all ages.  It is though provoking and requires deductive reasoning along with speed.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was your typical predictable love story that people seem to love to read. I would recommend it to people who like this genre.
B000Y179KO|2.0|Wow. Being one of the eagles biggest fans I almost feel guilty writing this. However, its not a good album/disc. As a obsessed music fan whos favorite group is the Eagles, I never dreamed it would be this bad. The Eagles are the ONLY band whos music I never got burnt out on from playing too much on the turtable in the past. I never, in my wildest dreams, thought it would go from that to an almost unlistenable cd. There is literally not 3 or 4 good songs on it. How do you go from the painted motion picture masterpiece such as Hotel California(the song) to \\"I love to watch a woman dance\\". I mean....really? I looked so foward to a good new cd and was so disappointed. As sacreligious as this is....I have to say its terrible. Hope they do better with another one down the road.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed meeting the characters in this novel, and guessing about what was going on in the bookstore. It was also fun to read a novel with all our contemporary &#34;gadgets&#34; involved with the plot.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This move was so relatable. Laughed the entire time. Everytime the to main characters would talk would it was like watching a movie about my life..
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|This movie is in the range of the unusual movies Phillip Seymour Hoffman or Joaquin Phoenix usually do. Enjoyed it thoroughly, from the the beginning to the end. Both of these actors are a cut above the normal and do not avoid subject matter which might be off the beaten track. It is not a run-of-the-mill production. It can shock and yet gives insight into what can occur in cult environments. Not pretty but worth every minute! Just take a deep breath!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I watched this movie several times.  The story is on Michael Orr and it showed how he went from nothing to having a wonderful career as a football star.  To me it's an great story that the whole family could watch and enjoy.  A family with a big heart taking him in and giving him all the benefits of a teenager and Michael Orr being so appreciative of the golden opportunity  of it makes this story so wonderful to watch.  I think that this story makes me believe that there are people in this world still wiling to go the extra mile for another person.
1250006341|5.0|My mother who watches at least one hour per day of the Downton Abbey series, over and over, loved the book.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|My husband watched this movie when I was gone, because he knew I wouldn't like it.  Funny thing is, he didn't like it either.  Waste of money.
B0000931QA|5.0|And now for a political review of a political CD. Operation: Mindcrime is about revolutionaries trying to overthrow the government, - \\"the rich control the government, the media the law, to make some kind of difference, then everyone must know, eradicate the fascists, revolution, will grow.\\" Metal has always been angry but never this focused, - \\"I used to think that only Americas way, way was right, but now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives, gotta make a million doesn't matter who dies, revolution calling, revolution calling, revolution calling you.\\" The video itself would prominently feature the image of David Duke.<br /><br />The entertainment industry is said to be liberal. Jay Leno made a joke about this on his show once, saying, \\"venture capitalists are in the process of developing their own liberal radio network to counter conservative shows like Rush Limbaugh. They feel the liberal viewpoint is not being heard -- except on TV, in the movies, in music, by comedians, in magazines and newspapers. Other than that, it's not getting out!\\". Metal music, though, had The Kinks, Ted Nugent, Rush, Ozzy and Gilby Clarke. Here, left vs right was closer to 50/50. Perhaps this reflected metals audience. In a world divided between the forces of revolution (the good guys), and the forces of reaction (the bad guys) there was probably no one more reactionary than the typical metal fan.<br /><br />To say metal music didn't get a lot of critical support would be an understatement. A lot of younger fans might not be old enough to remember this. Anything you like is a sin, of course, but I suspect this had little to do with the criticism! Queensryche themselves serve as an example. The music press covered the Seattle music scene extensively (where they list all the bands from Seattle), and the Seattle sound, after the band Nirvana made it big. They would never mention Queensryche who were not only the first Seattle band to make it big but had two multi-platinum albums in a row, with 'Empire' being release only a year before Nirvanas breakout 'Nevermind'. If only the Ryche were more obscure. At some point (and that may have been the point) classic metal became either acceptable or irrelevant, and, for good or bad, it no longer receives the constant negative references. I keep a few competing theories in my head as to why there was this universal bashing. I definitely believe there was some kind of orchestrated campaign behind it. Just my opinion. The band Accept has a song that might relate to that, with the lyrics, \\"Too many people do not know, Bondage is over the human race, they believe slaves always lose, and this fear keeps them down.\\"<br /><br />By the 1980's the majority of metal bands would also be writing progressive songs, and also taking up every cause but that of their fans, so it wasn't just metal's politics that were out of favor. This era would culminate nicely with the song 'Hanger 18' by Megadeth. The 1990's would bring us the inverted world of 'Rage Against the Machine'. Or as I personally refer to them, 'the comedy troupe known as Rage Against the Machine' - I do like their music. Not to be outdone Queensryche bring us Operation: Mindcrime - a really amazing album.<br /><br />When Mindcrime begins with, - \\"I'm tired of all this BS they keep selling me on TV about the communist plan, and all the shady preachers, begging for my cash, swiss bank accounts while giving their secretaries the slam, they're all in Penthouse now, or Playboy magazine, million dollar stories to tell, I guess Warhol wasn't wrong, fame fifteen minutes long, everyone's using everybody, making the sale\\" when they begin with TV selling us the communist plan and shady preachers. . . I had to wonder if they were being facetious here. While the media told me what defrocked minister Jim Bakker had for breakfast before his trial, I don't remember the communist plan coming up on TV, unless in discussing McCarthy (an anti-communist). The consensus being thatMcCarthy, who believed in a communist plan, was both wrong and evil. To find out about the communist plan I would have to read, \\"Masters of Deceit\\" by J Edgar Hoover and \\"None Dare Call it Conspiracy\\"<br /><br />I had to wonder if this part on here, these one or two lines, were intended to be a bit facetious. . . Pretty much tho, I take Mindcrime at face value. I've always loved this CD too. So there's no telling the taste of even a behind the times, dyed-in-the-wool neanderthal like me.<br /><br />'Empire' would be another great Queensryche CD and I would really like 'Promised Land' too but Mindcrime is king.McCarthy, who believed in a communist plan, was both wrong and evil.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|From a hot summer picnic to a freezing cold Christmas,  Angry Birds explore different holidays around the world! There is only one Update,  and that is the power -Ups, but it is very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1439110123|5.0|This book starts from the early days of oil and takes the reader into the 90's.  The book was a massive best seller and for good reason - it is simply brilliant.  He has since written a new book called &#34;The Quest&#34;  which takes the reader further on in the history of oil.  What I found most interesting is the section about WWII.  A huge part of the Allies success can be attributed to the almost endless supply of oil from the USA.  Both Germany and Japan were severely limited in their oil supplies and this led to there ultimate defeat.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I think Angry Birds HD is the same as the other ones,  so you might not want to get the HD version but it is still good.  I don't know why you would fight the King Pig for the first 2 planets then 3 planets with other pigs on the boss level then the King Pig and then other pigs. The thug I think ROVIO should really fix is the fact that the mighty eagle does not work very well and should destroy more because then you would just be wasting your money on something that would not work
B00913P6G0|5.0|I love this CD it's just good music nothing fake with a powerful message that a lot of our young African American males need to listen to.  This is a truly talented young man with a story to tell and he tells it well on Good Kid: M.A.A.D. City.<br /><br />You have to listen one time without skipping any tracks to understand the poetic story that he tells about growing up in a Mad city, the struggles with Peer pressure, keeping things real, the battle between Good and Evil, and the hope of still making it regardless of your circumstances.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Loved th e g a me slow to . Load but otherwise great. My kids love it to.  Not to hard as well as not to easy
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Much less expensive than the officially approved memory, but works. It passed memory tests and has been working for weeks.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|This is a fascinating story--Rodriguez's belated recognition and acclaim is like a modern-day fairytale.  That belated recognition, however, does not mitigate the real tragedy of this story: because of his apparent lack of success, Rodriguez stopped recording his music. (I don't know if he also stopped writing his music).  If someone stole the royalties from Rodriguez, they also stole from him the knowledge that might have encouraged him to keep singing and recording.<br /><br />Rodriguez seems to be a person of rare integrity--the movie makes me want to know a lot more about him and his music.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's the planet's greatest game. You do have to buy gems. But I think everyone who loves animals should get this game straight away.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i made the mistake. Read this in a couple days in hawaii then saw the movie the next day. hated the movie with a passion. if i had seen it maybe a month later i doubt i wouldve had such a reaction. the book was a quick and fun read. the movie basically just took the title and almost nothing else.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I know this is one of those books that opens the mind more and more. A book in which new treasure appear each time you visit it.
0345803507|5.0|Just Amazing Love Love Love this book and the story line to it is just fabulous. . . . .
B009CF7GRY|1.0|This movie was nothing compared to the original.  The acting in the new movie was very bad.  I didn't even make it through the entire movie.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|iTunes don't distribute this soundtrack on their store,<br />so I bought this OST here on amazon.com instead.<br />Glad I jump on the opportunity before it disappears<br />unexpectedly.
B00BU2TEGS|4.0|When I sampled this album before I purchased it I was a little skeptical.  I'm a very long time DM fan and I wanted the pre-sale code, so I bought it... And it has seriously grown on me. I also watched a lot of it live and it just keeps getting better.  Not their best work ever, but I'm really liking it  :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it is my favorite game is all I play and I like that is updated to a new place every month
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My four year old granddaughter loves it! Very easy to understand but challenging so she does not give up or get bored with it.
B003IDMUJA|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and captures the hardships of growing up in rural Africa brilliantly. The sheer determination of William to succeed despite his difficult circumstances is a true source of inspiration.<br /><br />This book caused me to reflect on my own attitude, circumstances, challenges and opportunities in life and it has allowed me to realise that I have much to be grateful for and that, no matter what difficulties we face, where there is a will there is a way!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anybody in need of some good motivation and inspiration!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The uniqueness of the concept of stocking salmon in Yemen was outstanding.  The writer could have done more with the relationships, however, as they were predictable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So you know that you are TOTALLY engrossed in a story when you gasp and then yell \\"OH MY GOD\\" out loud while reading a book! This was my first Colleen Hoover book to read and instantly she became my favorite writer!  The conversations that these characters have are so very real and genuine...YOU ARE COMPLETLY DRAWN IN to the story.  Not only did I yell out loud, but I laughed throughout the entire book, my eyes teared up and I totally FELL IN LOVE!  This book, above all others, is my FOVORITE!
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I bought this package 2 times, and every time I got bad CDs where the movie stops for no reason. I did try in many places, the CDs stop in the same spot.<br />First time I sent the package back and they sent me a new one, but with bugs in the same spots. I bought many shows on Amazon, this is the only one I have problems with, and it's very frustrating because we really enjoy the show.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is so cool you get buy new character's. and when you go to a wave like wave 5 &amp; 11 you get new samirais would like you guys to make a newer and cooler game like ninja's &amp; samurai's vs zombies &amp; alines the battle for courage because there fighting to see who will have the land cause like in this game the SAMURAI is fighting to get back his love so he has to go to all this waves to get his love back from the EVIL ZOMBIES!.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could hardly put this book down. Now onto book 3 and then the movies.  Excited to see what happens next.
B006OOHYIC|2.0|This game is boring and repetitive and it happens very quickly within the first few sets.  Don't waste your time.  Yawn.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was great if you love Ireland/England<br />The ending was a surprise  Easy Read. Awaiting another from this author! Yea
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app and gives me information that I need about charging, time remaining, etc.  I am having battery life issues with my Kindle Fire HD and it is really helping me figure out if I am doing something wrong or if I am having a warranty issue.  VERY HELPFUL.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I loved it. It was the story of the detective and the job<br />It also followed the undoing of the killer  !!  Go Harry
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am just starting Season 2 and I love these characters and each story.  I would highly recommend this.  One quickly becomes attached to each character.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter doesn't like it.... SHE LOVES IT!!!!!  I can't seem to get her off of her kindle.  I am glad I got this for her.
B008D36INE|5.0|One of te best character driven dramas I've see. In a long time. Great performances. A trip back in time to 1940s London.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a great look at the underlying politics going on behind passing the 13th amendment, and the heart of Lincoln as to why he believed it was so important.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. It kept my interest, always wanting to know more. The twist in Part two was brilliant. I simply loved the plot, characters, dialogue, the inner monologues and text. It's clever, cynical and delicious.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've never thought I'd watch a series like this, let alone like it enough to recommend to all my friends and family. It is very well-written and engaging. I've watched the entire season 1 in two days!<br /><br />And what a wonderful cast of actors and actresses. Everybody on this show is so talented. Each character has his or her own unique personality; they have their own concerns, emotions, and motives.<br /><br />One thing I really like about this show is how you can see the characters from different points of view. You think you hate a character because of something they do, but you'll become forgiving when you see them in a different light.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this show.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very moving, beautifully written story.  Couldn't put it down, would highly recommend it, requires several tissues!  Finished it in 2 days!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A wonderful and addicting game. This will be never get boring or old with new roads every time. Right now it is on a world tour and will go to many places and contents. You will have the time of your life with this exciting and thrilling app. ENJOY
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Fun read. A little complicated with all the names and kingdoms but definatly worth it. Cant wait to get the second book.
B000PMG16U|4.0|The best quality possible to see the Star Wars movies.<br />Lucas out did himself with this version of his vision.
B005LAII4E|3.0|is this the greatest movie ever well no but it is the best movie that i have seen this year so far. go and see it just don't have super high expections.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Based on a comc book series. There is a reason this is such a popular show. It is consistently a well made show, all around. You never know who can/will die in each episode. A band of survivors make their way through the zombie apocalypse. For a tv show there is plenty of blood, and the zombies are often pretty gruesome.<br />This bluray set contains a web series of the &#34;bicycle girl&#34;, which is really good too. Top notch creators in the industry contribute to this series weekly. If you have not seen it, check it out and see what the fuss is about. Yes it's a show about the zombie apocalypse. But you sometimes don't see zombies, except in the background. This is definitely a show about the interaction of people in this situation and how they deal with it.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|You really don't need the wisdom of some ancient civilization to live your life, but sometimes a reminder or two can really help.  I am living with a family member while she deals with terminal cancer.  She won't read it but I sure used the support to improve my patience and keep me at peace.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|I hear a lot of people claim it was just the first movie with a different location. It was. But if something works, why change it, right? It's funny from beginning to end. They did not disappoint here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app its so fun! But I do agree with Nicholas NEEDS UPDATES. I also like that you can play with your friends.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The only thing I can say negative about this is Lucas again has altered things. The most notably is the ewoks now have eyes and blink. They no longer look like their eyes are plastic sunglasses. Not sure if I like this or not. Just tired of Lucas constantly changing things. But the movies do look great in this format. If you are looking for the special features get to 6 movie box set.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|We purchased this through amazon and got the rental included while we wait. That is awesome! My son (8) wanted to see the goonies he searched on demand, Netflix, crackle, vudu, and Prime. When I realized I could buy it for $5 it made little sense to rent for half that. So we purchased through amazon and got to watch it that night. The DVD comes tomorrow and he'll be able to watch it any time.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Always liked Doctor Who, but series five and six are by far the best. Matt Smith brings a certain quality to the Doctor. The effects are now updated and much better than years past. Doctor Who is possibly one of the better written tv shows today. Clever, funny, hip and just fun.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We rented this for family movie night. It was a great choice my son (8)was fully engaged and loved the story. The effects and colors were just amazingly vivid. The emotion in the story came through very well. No surprise it was highly acclaimed. I don't typically buy the hype but this one met the mark. Amazon rental was great clear no buffering issues seamless like putting the DVD in.
B008I74JLS|5.0|If you like the Sy-Fy version, you will love the BBC. It's the original and far superior show. The production is better than most American shows past or present. Well worth the price. They just finished the series with season 5, so you may want to try to get a box set with all 5 or just get this then the 5th (as the 5th just finished in mid March 2013).
B004SIP7QC|5.0|A family movie that would be loved by all! One of the best of Johnny Depp. He might be Peter Pan!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I have not enjoyed Doctor Who this much in many many years. And Amy Pond is the best sidekick the Doctor has ever had.
0307341577|5.0|Good entertaining read could not put it down I also read gone girl its was also a a good read
B005ARYDYC|5.0|This is a great addition to my bluray collection. Great picture and sound and has some good extras. Well worth the price.
B009369Z8A|5.0|1930s wild time when men where men and took what they need to servive bang bang shoot em up!! watch it
B004ULEEY8|4.0|This is about a marine unit tasked with helping evacuate Los Angeles, before they nuke it to repel an alien invasion. It works well. And it's very entertaining. I really did like this movie. I really don't know many who did not like it, to be honest.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|really not a big fan on musicals but this was well done plus i owed my wife a chick flick
B002ZG97M4|4.0|I was very hesitant about them remaking this classic. But they really did a good job. There are little nods to the original, if you pay attention (set pieces, costumes from the original). They did a good job of updating this.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I am a history fan who usually watches documentaries.  However, this is a drama that recreates viking life.  It makes a lot of assumptions and fills in gaps, but it is all totally credible in my opinion.  I was not expecting it to be this good, but it is now one I wait for every week.  It's a really good show.
0762434260|1.0|I did not realize it came in multiple pieces.  One of the pieces was stripped and would not stay together with its mate.  It was the middle brown piece, so I just left it out and screwed the top and bottom together and then the handle.  I thought this would last, but no.  Thing broke within an hour.  I am now ordering a different wand from a different manufacturer.  Not worth the cost of shipping to send it back.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The title says it all! I do wish there were a better tutorial in the beginning of the game or even a better set of story lines with the quests but all in all its a great game!
0545268850|5.0|Well read, well told, shortens my commute.  I now have it to listen to again.  A very reasonable price as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of those books that after you finish you continue to think about it andyou like it more and more.  The author didn't just write a story, he created a whole world that could very well be our world in the future.  The destruction of the buggers shows a government that created a hoax in order to destroy a civilization that no longer was a threat.  The children were duped into thinking they were doing nothing more than playing a game when in reality they were fighting a war and controlling and destroying real lives.  A chillingly real glimpse into the future and the power of government.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I have loved these movies for years and have been looking for them on bluray in my local stores and was unable to find them, this was a great price for all three of these movies on bluray. thankyou seller for quick shipping on a great product the quality was excellent and they were new in an unopened box.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I Enjoyed this book. It was a little predictable but it is a good easy read. I would recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is way fun and I can't stop playing it. It has beautiful graphics and I love the little challenge in it.
B001AR44MW|5.0|This is a movie that I can watch over and over.  There is suspense, drama, pain, disappointment and then a realization of what is actually going on.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|The ap repeatedly takes more hearts than I have played and now it won't load. It loads and then immediately closes. I like the game t they need to fix the glitches.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|It's more lovely and fun than expected. It is not just a light comedy, it is more inspirational. If you want to be shown some encouragement, or if you want to feel inspired, this would be a good choice. Life could be hard, but we can be happy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so glad I stumbled upon this app. I play it allllllll the time. now that I am on the roll, I don't know that I am going to stop any time soon.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|It's got all the elements (no pun intended) for a gripping viewing experience.  It's even educational.  The acting is brilliant, too.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The story gave me a new understanding of how &#34;ambulance chasers&#34; work. A megafirm lawyer throws his carreer away and joins a couple of tired and struggling attorneys pursuing traffic accident and injury cases. The story of his transformation is a good read.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Loved Mysteryville 1 but am not as happy with the second one as some of the things are not easy at all to do and no help is given to get you in the right direction.  I love the challenge but not happy when I run into a snag and there is no hint to assist you along.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read that kept me hooked! Suprising twists and turns throughout the story. I don't want to give any secrets away so just read it!
006097625X|5.0|This book by Scott McCloud is a one of a kind classic. It's more than a handbook, more like a draftsman's cartooning bible for the genre of the graphic novella. A required modern day reference for any kind of illustrator or drawer!
B009KEN87O|2.0|This was a fun game up to level 33-1 which isthe Tetris style level where you have to shoot the blocks to clear the lines.  Stupid.  Waste of time trying this level over &amp; over again.  Eventually the fun turns to frustration and not worth playing.  Don't create levels that are nearly impossible to pass, it ruins the point of playing a game.
B007712XAU|5.0|I started watching 3rd season on PBS after my husband bugged me.  He loved it, so I jumped in & too loved it so much had to go back & watch 1st 2 seasons on DVD.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Well written and translated. Good character development. Started slow but pace picked up. Plot unfolded naturally and logically, great attention shown to both major and minor characters.<br />A good read. Looking forward to the next two.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Good book,but the French language was irritating at times. Loved the twist at the ends, I did not plan on that being the conclusion.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Similar in concept to the old game Miner 2049er without having to go to each and every section of the level, this is an interesting but flawed game.<br /><br />The sound and graphics are pretty good, but the control is frustrating. Rather than a virtual gamepad and jump button, it has a virtual pad with jump up, left and eight. To me this is awfully clunky. What is there is responsive, however.<br /><br />Some better control would make this considerably more fun, and as is, it only has promise of fun, in my opinion.
B0066NA8CU|2.0|[[ASIN:B0066NA8CU Pilot]] THE GOOD WIFE Seasons 1 & 2<br /><br />I watched the first two seasons of this show on Amazon Prime.  In my opinion, the ONLY thing GOOD about this show was its acting.  Period!  The storyline:  here's a woman who stands by her man.  Through anything!  Here's a wonderful, gorgeous, marvelous man who cheats on his wife, not once or twice (which could, indeed, be forgiven -- but numerous times.  (You might detect sarcasm here.)  Meanwhile, she is Suzy Homemaker, running the house, caring for her family -- being a wife and mother.  Then, his political kingdom takes a serious fall and viola!  He realizes he is in love with wife after all.  He goes to jail.  She goes to work becoming the bread winner and her career takes off.  Because there are children between this exemplary couple, they remain on friendly terms.  Okay so far.  Then we move into all of the usual Hollywood re-educational propaganda!  The numerous plot twists and turns taking the human being to its lowest common denominator!  Just another typical nighttime Soap Opera.  Nothing new here.  Except that the television industry seems determined to move womanhood backward and NOT forward.  Oh, you say:  but she's a lawyer -- good career choice and good example for woman???  I agree ..... if she is single ... or if there is a truly loving cohesive family structure so that the kids are properly emotionally, spiritually as well as physically nourished  ... or if the kids are grown, or if there is a true need for both parents to work.  Look at the kids in this show.  No, they do not demonstrate good emotional nourishment.  No good ethics, no truly good character traits, no good morality.  This show is demonstrative of the state of most American households and thinking these days.  Look at our young today.  In the past, many of our families had both parents working to make a living.  Yet, those parents knew how to instill good values into their kids to produce honest, decent people to movethis Country forward.  Look at our society today.  Clearly we model ourselves after our Soaps.  And we wonder why this Country is failing!  We watch anything and model ourselves after what we see.  Once upon a time, we, as a society, were concerned about our young and their character development.  Today, we just want to be like the neighbors next door.  No matter what they are really like.  So, if you want to be like that and your children to be like that, then watch this show.  And watch our society continue to crumble.  Oh yes.  I am sure their are countless many in this Country who would disagree with this review of this show.  When you watch just to see what is on the screen with your eyes and not your brain, then certainly you would disagree with me.  But, our children are watching and they do likewise.  It used to be that soft porn was objectionable to every decent human being.  Now we have soft porn in our tv shows and movies.  Its okay because we have been trained to accept it.  My but what progress we have made!  The Good Wife???  I think NOT!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Set in Sweden, this story captures the essense of Swedish understated humour. It isn't what you you expect - or rather not what I expected. And so I was delighted to go through this book with an eagerness to find out what happened next. Well I suppose much of it is far-fetched. But somehow the reader accepts the ridiculous as part of an amazing story.<br /><br />The main character is of course 100 years old and &#34;escapes&#34; from his care home and so begins an easily believeable course of events that are strikling funny. Add to that, the 100 years past of the old guy and you get wonderfully balanced book that amuses and entertains.<br /><br />Warning [from experience]  - don't try and read this book while your wife or husband is trying to sleep. You will get that mattress-vibrating problem from half-stifled violent laughter that wakes people up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First off, you people who said you play on the bus, don't know about your school rules but we cant have electronics so.... Secondly, I hope this isn't just me but every time I get a gem it goes aaahhhh..... splat!  I just cant stay focused long enough to make the turn or jump after the gem! But overall,  this is the best app ever! And if your trying to decide whether or not to get it, get it!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I liked the vivid realness of this movie.  The tiger scenes and effects were awesome.  Good movie the whole family can enjoy!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great book to read when on vacation. Could not put this down. A really unexpected ending. Plan to read more books by this author
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|Painful dialog, stupid plot, unnecessary drama.  Other than the hot blond, I painfully took one for the team watching this with my daughters.
B000FBJAEG|2.0|The plot and characters were interesting enough, but very slow moving.  The writer thinks his readers are unintelligent since he seems to have the need to explain every detail to the nth degree.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|A bad knock off of 50 shades. Ava/ana Gideon cross/ Christabel grey. I was really looking forward to reading this one hoped it was better than the first but it was worst.  Do not was your time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely thought it was a beautiful love story between a very frightened and abused woman and finding a man that truly loved her inspite of her past.  The move was still great, but they have to cut so much out of the movie from the book.  I am very glad I saw the movie and read the book
1603425381|5.0|Interesting and varied combinations to work with. I like to design my own patterns and these  options give me alot to choose from.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great action with some comedy mixed in, a few parts were a little cheesy, but overall, very fun to watch. I would watch it again.
1603420398|5.0|Really enjoyed looking throught this book. I love russian crochet. This will make copying the details and adapting to my own patterns.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is a funny coming of age show.  It's entertaining and reminds me of my high school years.  Not just for youngsters.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This is one of their best albums yet, my other favorites are From beale street to oblivion and blast tyrant if that gives you an idea of the type of music i like. Earth Rocker gives a good tribute to the bluesy feel we love from Clutch, while keeping the hard rock we always want. All throughout the album you will hear up beat jams with exception to Gone Cold. 5/5 would recommend to any Clutch fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great. it is really cool and perfect for kids to play. the theme changes every time you get the upgrade which makes it even more fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book! Love the story and the way he writes. The characters drew me in and were very inspiring. Must read.
B004SBX112|4.0|I would recommend this to a friend. Some levels I can't do yet.  I don't under stand how it gives out the stars.  My goal right now is to finish the levels.
B0086700CM|5.0|Loooooove this game. Already addicted to it! Esp. love the fact that there are objectives, makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something and not just playing some random game. Definitely the best free game I've had so far!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I had this movie on VHS when my older kids were little and I just fell in love with the whole story of Babe.  When we got rid of all of VHS children's movies (along with all of our VHS players) I knew I had to replace this particular movie so I'd have it for me and my future grandchildren to enjoy.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Well done, nice power ups. Good clean graphics combined with adventurous gameplay!<br />It never gets boring and levels challenge you making you a better pilot!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Love the book and I'm so looking forward to the movie this summer, I love all of the different perspectives across the world of WWZ and its aftermath.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|I loved all the songs,even more after watching the documentary,very impressed with Dave Grohl and all his work,if you love music,you will love this.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Everyone who cares about themselves and the environment really should read this book.  It is a very quick read and I found it very informative.  If you are feeling at all blue, depressed, mood swings, fatigued, achy joints, overweight, sluggish, you must read this book.  I have been off wheat for a couple of months now and the inflammation in my joints is gone, and I have lost 15 pounds.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|what can I say it was a great movie although I like history, my other half fell asleep but he likes action movies so ......
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nicholas Sparks did a great job of spinning a mystery that lacked deep violence or over done sex.  All the characters were believable and it had a nice twist at the end.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I have been trying to catch up with The Good Wife. I am re-watching entire second season. So glad it is available on Amazon Prime. This show has drama, a little humor and always a great storyline.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|this is a very good show. I liked it very much. I always like this kind of movies. The imagination of the writers is wonderful.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Great movie, great actors and actresses, great story that is quite plausible. What's not to like? If you haven't seen this move, buy it, as you will watch it again and again over the years.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like it , its like the original one, and it help with hand -eye coordination. I only play when I have enough time.
B009R89HY6|4.0|The book is great. It might look for a kid's book, but adults can enjoy it too. The only reason why I have it 4 stars is due to the limitation of allowing download only to Kindle for mobile phones (in my case, my galaxy note II Android phone). I would buy the whole series of the books, but this stopped me from doing so. Even on my 5,5\\" cellphone screen where I have kindle reader installed, it was barely tolerable to read, as the nature of the book with the drawings does not allow changing the text size and zooming in or out. I would enjoy to read it on my computer screen where I also have kindle reader installed, but for some reason it's not allowed. That really took away some of the fun for me. Just telling you know.<br /><br />Please, Amazon, consider the self-explanatory. When I pay and buy a book, I wish to read it to the media I wish. If you allow kindle reader for PCs, then also allow the books to be read there!
B007N85POS|4.0|This is a fun game and keeps the children busy for long periods.  They take turns to see who can do the best
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|Ethan Hawke potrays Ellison Oswalt a Novelist who decides to move his family to a new Home. I will stop there because i dont want to spoil the film, but I will say this: Sometimes Moving IS NOT the best idea. Sinister not only has a strong supporting cast, but a story line that is very convincing, and actually quite frightening. I was shocked and still scared even after I had finished watching Sinister. You may disagree with me completely and that is perfectly alright. Sinister is a HORROR movie. I will confess that I was not immediately able to go to sleep after watching this movie; even stranger, it was stuck in my head for a few days. It does its job and serves its purpose entirely, so I give the movie Sinister:<br /><br />4.5 stars
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This an amazing game.<br /><br />You are given a cube, similar to Rubik 's cube, but covered with different shapes and colors in each cube.<br /><br />You match these similar to mahgongg.  You match pairs until they're all gone. but here's what differs.<br /><br />1.  It's in a cube.<br /><br />2.  All cubes are available, not just end ones.<br /><br />Since it is a cube, you need to be able to see all sides.  This is by simply swiping your finger on the screen.  It is amazing how the cube rotates.  You can see all sides, and top and bottom.  You can rotate it so you can see parts of multiple sides at once.  Even the perspective is perfect.  The cubes get smaller as they're further away.<br /><br />This has amazing graphics.  As I said the animation of the cube is super.<br /><br />Very addictive and highly recommended.  Don't pass this one up.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|The movie itself was pretty much what I wanted; a sequel that improved on the original.  I would give this 4 stars if the video quality was better.  Unfortunately, many scenes looked worse than up scaled DVD.  I haven't seen this on Blu-ray, but I can't believe a movie released in 2012 could have such lousy picture quality.  A couple of scenes were bordering on VHS quality.  My connection has a ping in the upper teens and average download in the upper twenty Mbps.  This was on a PS3 connected to a Panasonic 65&#34; plasma.<br /><br />For this particular version, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show, it is so heartwarming and genuine. The characters (Minnie is my favorite) and their little dilemmas are lots of fun to watch. If you love British period shows, you will love it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love watching lives of a different class and time of people, difficult for most people to relate to! Costuming and settings are fantastic! Love the historical influence of WWI displayed in this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Have to admit, I'm hooked. Didn't read the previews or reports from the papers, so I wasn't aware of where the ending to the season was heading. Do hope that we'll allow for some happiness in the upcoming season. Poor Mary is looking a bit like a martyr.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Loved it the first time I cried like a baby and it hit me hard. took me two weeks to get over this, now I sing the music all the time!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great movie! This movie ties together the whole &#34;Men in Black&#34; series. Put a tear in my eyes at the end.
1451695195|4.0|I read the book,  but i just wasn't quite as drawn to it as I had hoped. I'm sure others love it and it's very well written, but it just didn't do it for me.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I tried many times to acquire this game for my kindle.  I could download it alright but always got an error message when trying to install it which told me to try later.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is incredibly hard to put down and completely engrossing. The possibilities for construction and terraforming are practically limitless.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|One of my favorite shows! If you loved gossip girl and the oc, youll love this show as well great first season!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this much much  better than solitaire. It is more challenging or less challenging depending on the amount of cards used .  Hold my interest longer.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Loved this season even though it was short! If your a chair fan youll love the finale! The season ended months ago andi already going through withdrawls!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read this book in two days. It was addicting. The story line was always getting more intense. It was a little hard to believe at times and this Holder dude was like the man from Mars for being so sweet ALL THE TIME....other than that, great book. Loved it.
0345525558|4.0|Very different than another other book I've read. It held my interest and I liked the ending. Not sure this is everyone's cup of tea but if you want to read different, this is it.
B005ZHB84U|4.0|Love the movies, and the music is a big part of it.  This was very similar to the first sound track so not as unique but still great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this becuase of the reviews. However, I was a little hesitant as a guy if I would like the book. It was a good story with good characters.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Never would have guessed this was Hans Zimmer-love it and made this awesome movie that much better!  Listen to it all the time.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|All 10 seasons I've been following this show.  I love all the characters and feel like I know them well.  I love this show.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is so worth the download. I spent several hours a week building up my military and crushing the KRA. Get it!
B009GX6SSK|5.0|This is wonderful and particularly because the plots are character driven.  I wouldn't miss one single solitary episode of this tv show.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is an exceptional app with lots of fun. If I had one complaint it would the updating , but over all an amazing game
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Good game. Average controls but still holds up to a hours of fun gameplay. Would recommend this game. Nice graphics.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Made to be accurite, I can watch it many times, have done so, though I find the middle part a little slow. Read the books too, you will like them as well.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|If you need to help out with Math Homework, this is a great app - it often gives you the steps to result as well. Overall a great investment. My main grievance is that the keyboard is too overloaded. I wish they come up with a smarter keyboard as well as one that detects you enter a fraction so you don't have to put many brackets around them.
6305657947|5.0|This up date is much better than the Steve McQueen version from the 70's. I can watch this one over and over again. good movie.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Exciting--astonishing--surprising!!!!!  What a great series.  The portrayal of the addictive process is very real, and very sad.  the changes in Walts behavior are so sad and so real.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am pleased with this product and the service was very fast - I like that because I don't like to wait.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Everything is perfect with this, it came on time, great shape, great quality of the image, sound, extras, etc., looks awesome, the series is great. Great product
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome  I play it every day my sister my brother and me all love playing it I love kiloo games you have really out done your selves this time thanks so much
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Awesome movie, the quality of the image and sound is great, all the films and the extras.<br />it came on time, reallly fast, the box and everything in great shape, no complains at all.
B00AAQHP66|3.0|Yes I really liked the movie. I thought the story was well put together . Living in Santa Cruz has a influence cause of are surf culture and the movie was filmed here. It was nice to see the place you live in the movies.But I don't think it's for everyone<br />Be cool Surfs UP
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a fantastic piece of historical fiction. Ken Follett does such a great job developing characters and inserting them into the time period. It lends a different, more personal perspective to the time period.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game I think it's great!!!! When I got my kindle fire this was the first app I got.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle has a wonderful cast of actors, excellent writers and just the right amount of humor, mystery & intrigue.  It is never a disappointment!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best diary of a wimpy kid book yet!! Can't wait for more books to come out!!  Jeff Kinney did a great job...REALLY FUNNY!!!!\\"\\"
B009O07NBQ|5.0|As with the soundtrack to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", Maestro Shore's music not only fits the movie \\"The Hobbit\\", it ennobles it! If you are familiar with the scenes in the movie, you will love this soundtrack. It follows the order of the film. I don't think any other composer could have captured the feeling of the peaceful Shire and Hobbiton than Howard Shore! (The themes for the Shire will be familiar to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" fans.)<br /><br />The soundtrack to \\"The Hobbit\\" is a perfect companion to the movie. Highly recommended.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is how action flics should be made. Renner continues to impress me since I first took note of him in Hurt Locker. He commands the screen whenever he's on it. He's even better in my opinion than Damon, and I thought Damon was very good indeed as Bourne. The story follows the Bourne formula, with the hero being pursued by his rogue government agency employers, the girl-interest well played by Rachel Weisz, the obligatory car (or motorcycle, in this case) chase down the streets of some third world city (Manila, this time). But it's all done so well it's a hoot to watch. On reviewing I especially liked the relationship between Aaron Cross (Renner) and the other \\"program participant\\" he links up with at the remote cabin in Alaska - good dialog and appealing characters.
B00486070K|5.0|Ordered this after having trouble with a cheaper one that stopped working after a day. This works perfectly, nothing to download, and it works with my chromebook as well as macbook air. Didn't have to do anything with the chromebook, just plugged it in and it worked.
B00BEJL3IY|3.0|\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is yet another attempt by Hollywood to revamp fairy tales and fantasies by name directors. Tim Burton did it. Sam Raimi, too. Even Terry Gilliam. It's only natural that Bryan Singer (\\"The Usual Suspects\\" \\"X-Men\\") directs the updated version of the famous fairy tale. And like many previous efforts, the film is visually attractive, but needs better storytelling.<br /><br />Nicholas Hoult plays a young farm boy Jack, who falls in love with Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who runs away from the palace. When the Princess has been carried away up into the sky (in a rather contrived fashion), Jack volunteers to join the rescue party including scheming Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) and the King's elite guard Elmont (Ewan McGregor).<br /><br />The story takes too much time to get going, with a prologue about the giants and back stories about the main characters, but once it gets started, the film is entertaining with thrilling action set-pieces, in which human actors, motion-capture giants and CG-created beanstalks blend pretty effectively. Special effects are decent, if not outstanding, and the sceneries and castle of the Kingdom of Cloister are beautiful to see.<br /><br />For all the enjoyable action sequences, however the film has a feel of \\"been there, done that.\\" Two young stars do their best, but, likeable as they are, the hero and heroine are bland, and I wanted to see more of Ewan McGregor's dashing Elmont, which is the best part of the film.<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is just an OK adventure film that is in need of creative ideas on how to tell a familiar story. The film needs something creative and unique that is briefly seen in its clever ending.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My daughter loves the heroine in this movie and there is enough action to keep her older brother interested even after six, or so, viewings, and counting.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Not only can you easily track the major markets and indexes, but also individual stocks. It is hard to believe that you get this much from a free App.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Awesome Movie, Best film Ever. Completed my collection. Great Action and yes would recommend it most definitely to everyone out there.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|My wife and I are in our 40s and read all of the reviews for this movie.  The reviews range from &#34;terrible&#34; to &#34;amazing&#34; and everything in between, but we like the cast and director of the movie, so we decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately we just couldn't like the movie, even though we really tried.  Our main issue with the movie was that we found it very depressing.  Everyone in the movie seemed to have problems and did nothing but complain about them.  The humor was crude (that was expected) and some of the characters' issues hit close to home, but, overall, the movie just didn't work for my wife and I.<br /><br />We made it through all but the last 30 minutes, then had to turn it off... just too darn depressing for us.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Awesome Movie, Best film Ever. Completed my collection. Great Action and yes would recommend it most definitely to everyone out there.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I recently started watching Castle but I had miss the first show where Becket and Castle meet! It was hilarious and I enjoyed watching it. The video streaming was excellent.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Awesome Movie, Best film Ever. Completed my collection. Great Action and yes would recommend it most definitely to everyone out there.
1594746168|4.0|This 200 page book starts by telling the life-tale of Dr. Spencer Black, a rising star in the anatomical studies field. Somewhere along the line he gets off the rail and starts looking at the bodies in front of him as incomplete (there's more to it than that but it would be spoiler stuff). His studies take a darker turn along with the dark turn his personal life does. Ultimately he creates a book of oddities, of which only six copies are made before he halts the printing. The reader is given the opportunity to read what was in this mysterious tome.<br />I made an odd link in my mind to a book called \\"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick\\" by Bruce Van Alsburg. In that book a man brings a series of drawings into a publisher and then disappears, leaving him with just the drawings and a simple one line prompt about the possible tale that goes with it. After reading Black's life story and then looking at the creature drawings, I get much the same vibe. The only thing that kept this book from garnering the fifth star was the fact that the story of Black and what happened to him just stops. There are no hints of what happened to him or intriguing tidbits that grab your attention, it just stops. I was hoping to the last sentence that there would be some sort of twist to give me that \\"Oooooh.\\" moment. It never came.<br />The book is beautifully rendered and the artwork is amazingly detailed and researched. I am going to fudge some of the dates and use this book as a source book for one of my role-playing games called Deadlands.<br />If this book had a better ending I would highly recommend this as a cool yet creepy book. Since it just stops I can only recommend it as a really neat reference book with an interesting tale included.
0783230370|5.0|Awesome Movie, Best film Ever. Completed my collection. Great Action and yes would recommend it most definitely to everyone out there.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I started reading this book, and about half way through I had to stop.  I believe this could have been a good book, 'if' it had been paced and thought out.  Everything seemed to happen at once; the main character seemed to gain control of his magic within a matter of days; possible incest; and the King and Queen who when introduced in the start of the book were described as two people who loved each other more than anything, but as you progress you come to find out that both of them have affairs all the time, they hate each other, and they don't seem to know which of their children are theirs, and how many bastards the king may have spawned.  All in all I gave it two stars for effort, I just can't believe that there are more books in the series.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is a wonderful book. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Her characters are enthralling and her story line has many fascinating twists and turns. I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing it is the best game ever I could play it for 1000 years buy it for free.it has about 100 cities
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a lot of fun!!! Awesome graphics and characters.  Each level challenges are attainable, but allows you to continue to move on even if the time challenge is not met. Great for all ages.
B005LAIISU|4.0|These films have held up well from the beginning until now. This one is no exception. It is a lot of fun and the kids, once again, loved it! What more do you need?
B005K17RU0|2.0|this app was great until the latest update. now it takes a long time to load and tends to lock up my fire.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I like Bruno Mars, so this was a no brainer! It's got a great beat and it's easy to dance to.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app comes on the KF already. It is glitching so I wanted to uninstall then reinstall but cannot! STINKS! USELESS NOW!
B005K17RU0|2.0|: i enjoyed the app before the most recent upgrade. i don't like the layout or design of the new verson as much as the old one
B004TI5N38|5.0|John Puller is called in on a suspicious assignment that takes him into coal country.  He is sent alone with no technicians, no support.  This in itself is highly irregular and John figures it out as he tries to investigate the deaths of an army officer and his entire family.  It takes a while, but John with the help of his older prisoner brother works the problem out and nails the culprits.  This one is fast-paced and well-written like most of Baldacci's books.
B009AMANBA|5.0|When I grew up, Abraham Lincoln had achieved the status in the minds of Americans as a man who changed the world and America forever. He is viewed in many ways in America, as a man who lead the fight to abolish slavery and also as a man that suffered heavily with the burden of the Civil War and the deaths of so many people.<br /><br />I watched this film thinking that is was about his life and how he became president and the issues that he had to deal with. Part of that is in the film but in reality, very little. It is more about an insight into the politics in Washington during the presidency of Lincoln. It tells how Lincoln, his aids, the army and his supporters fought for an amendment that in their hearts they knew had to be passed and implemented if America was ever to truly become the land of the free and a world leading country. The film is based on a book titled Team Of Rivals: The Political Genius Of Abraham Lincoln and that is what the film is about.<br /><br />While this film was not what I expected I still enjoyed it and I found it intriguing and entertaining. The acting was superb and Daniel Day-Lewis played the role to perfection. The cinematography was awesome and from the scenes of Washington DC in that time period to the battlefields it made you understand the time and the sadness of the war and slaughter that took place.<br /><br />This film is very good and I am glad that I watched it. It is a part of American history that we should not forget. It was presented with an excellent cast and a well written storyline. I rated it 5 stars and I recommend it as a good film.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|this movie was reaaaaaaaaaaaaly easy to know what was going to happen when you see how was the character, kinda frustrating that everything went the rango way, still worth the shot but wont watch it again
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have not had time to fully review it, however it looks like good.  Looking forward to using it as a study guide.
0783231032|5.0|great movie i was impressed that it was in stock very happy with the service i will order more for sure thankyou very much
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she watches it almost everyday, I also watched it myself and see the reason why she loves it so much. Great family movie.
B007SGM084|3.0|Interesting.  Not all everyone said about it as far as I am concerned.  It was risky but I have read worse.  Not that I mind the subject, I find it fun, just not as bad as I expected it to be with all the talk.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved the characters and plot line.  An easy read with a great look into the mind of a confused teenager.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|It is OK.  Honestly I bought it for one song and don't really listen to it much.  But that is just me.
0547884591|2.0|Not really impressed with the book although Mr. Ferriss is with himself.  Not much original content in the book.  I wouldn't recommend the book.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Great album.  Love Christina Perri.  Loves her voice and her fun songs, I have most of her albums.  Enjoy it greatly.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|$50 for an automatic watch is a steal.  Especially if the watch in question is a Seiko.  It keeps great time, looks nice and holds a wind very well.  Leaving the watch in the drawer for a day is no issue as it is still running after 24 - 30 hours without fail.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Love it!  Live Like Jay!  Best movie, from the heart and really tells a fantastic story about an amazing guy, Jay Moriarity.  An inspiration and a life cut far too short.  Just an amazing story with some sick shots of beautiful, powerful waves.  Actors did great in their roles and really told the story well.  Not over done at all, very enjoyable.  Laughed, cried and watched with jaw to the floor.  Fantastic movie!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Haven't read anything bad from Sophia Kinsella. LOVED IT!!! Read it twice!! I have suggested it to all my Kindle friends and more!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I loved playing the Mobilityware version of Solitaire, but I recently got an unknown error message saying I needed to redownload the app from the appstore.<br /> I have made many unsuccessful attempts to do that.  I get the same message when I try to download. Very frustrating!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Terrific character development! The dialogue is crisp and true and propels the plot. This is definitely a reader's delight. Great place and emotional movement.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Great timing adding this right before the baseball season starts. It's a tradition of mine to watch this movie before every opening day! Go Braves
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My fiance loves this game pack. He plays it all the time. I play it too but not as often.
B000JNN0SM|5.0|When James Cameron decided to do a sequel to the first terminator, the whole world stop. This movie is everything a good action movie is. Great cast, great affects, great acting, and a whole ton of actions. The t-1000 was cool as heck. James Cameron should stick back to making this kinds of movies instead of doing dumb stuff like Avatar.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I cannot explain how long I have waited for this album to come out! I  preordered it and it was here the day it came out. I have listened to every song and I am happy to say that they have not lost their song! Excellent album for anyone who likes Onerepublic!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a good way to kill time. I just hate the fact now they're offering superpowers for real money.
0307719774|4.0|I'm on my 4th month of writing in it, and find it enjoyable. Not all of the questions are great, but each person probably had a different opinion on that. I think it will be nice each following year to readd previous answers and see what's changed. I like it better than my old journaling method of just writing when I needed to vent, which is helpful but not as fun to re-read over the years.
B009KEN87O|5.0|By far the best space game I have ever played. Exciting, beautiful, and habit forming. I would have paid twice as much.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yep - They got it right this season. I am a little bummed that herds are not always acting like we saw in season 2 but that could be explained by having the sound machine shut down... Hope they do it and get back to having to worry about making the noise again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I bought the second game first and enjoyed that one, that I decided to get the first one.  Nice graphics and fun game. Really worth the money. If you like to do strategy puzzles, you won't be disappointed.
B005LAII62|5.0|This was a great movie for adults and kids alike. My husband and I are huge fans of most CG movies especially when zombies, monsters, etc., are involved. The quality of this movie was nice along with the packaging.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series, some surprising things happening in season 3. I had already seen most of season 3, but the special features were new & great.
0061537969|5.0|This is a great book as it takes you through a gambit of emotions. I must say that the sad parts of the book evoke extreme reaction. I've heard of others crying as certain parts and did I. Usually I am not a fan of animal books but this one was really enjoyable albeit sad at times.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I watched two episodes and now I have to watch at least two episodes every night. I really got hooked on this series.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was purchased a part of a Christmas gift for my husband. The price for this set was completely fare given all 8 movies are included. The packaging is simple and not the most durable but again that goes with the price.
B0090SI4OC|1.0|Reason number one this movie failed: They failed at the Melanie/Wanda relationship. This is the heart and the core of the book. If you fail at this, the movie is dead in the water. In the movie Melanie was demanding, harsh and NEVER shuts up. She also in control a lot. In the book that isn't the case. She has an option and when Wanda does something she doesn't agree with she speaks up, but Wanda for the most part ignores her and other then that she stays pretty quite, expect with Jared and Ian. In the book Melanie is feisty and strong willed. Not a total bitch. They also have a strong bond. so when Melanie comes to the conclusion that she wants give her back her body, you not left with the question, \\"Why is Melanie fighting this?\\"<br /><br />Reason number two the movie has failed: Miscast of the minor characters. I feel like with the exception of Jeb, Melanie/Wanda, Jared and Ian...everyone else was miscast. The worst had to be Doc and Burns<br /><br />Reason number three this movie failed: The awesome little details were all left out. This movie was rushed. Because it was rush all the little details were left out. The thing the suffered the worst from all these lack of details were the relationships with everyone. Aunt Maggie and Sharon were barley seen, It's hard to understand why Ian fell for Wanda, the relationship between Jared and Wanda is just confusing and Doc is completely left out, so it doesn't make sense when he lies for her later on in the book. Some important characters were also left out. Like Walter, a dying man who becomes Wanda's first real friend, and first real lost and Sunny, another soul who was in Kyle's girlfriends body.<br /><br />Overall, I'm shocked that Meyer's screwed up her own book into movie so bad. Maybe she should have left this to the pros? I know that there were budget concerns. I agree that THIS is the movie that needed to be spilt up into two movie, NOT BREAKING DAWN. I'm going to say to read the book if you really want to experiences this movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was recommended by my mother. My father passed only 2 months ago. Dr. Alexander's experiences correlate with what I'd guessed my father was experiencing both before he passed and after. Reading this helped to reinforce what I'd thought was happening. Dad was back in school and getting all the answers to all the questions he'd ever asked. He's back in school and loving every minute of it!<br />The concepts expressed here weren't too difficult for me to understand, though I did have to look up a few words.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who's lost someone close to them. Who wouldn't want their loved ones to be surrounded by God's love for eternity? And to find that we're all surrounded by unconditional love is comforting.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I wish that they had gone farther in the story than they did but overall I enjoyed it.  I am looking forward to the next installment.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|The audio was a great mix and the video was well produced. Definitely a must have for Zep fans and for those who never had an opportunity (like me) to see these guys perform live.
B00BF123WG|2.0|This was probably the most boring movie that I have seen in awhile.  There were too many stretches of nothing.  At the end the amount of dark scenes seemed endless.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Normally sequels aren't as good as the original.  Not true here.  This movie is awesome.  It seems to me that some new technology has been developed to produce this film.  It was just amazing!
B0037NB6QE|5.0|I am on a mission to read all of Debbie Macomber's book.  I love all the book about Blossom Street!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very nicely done.  Just like galaga and space invaders combined. A little gittery on movingbut tolerable.  Passes time when needed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love the interactive part of this game. It is very fun and quite amusing. Great game. I would highly recommend.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I like Adele's music, and thought watching a concert of hers might be interesting. So, I bought this one, and it's very good. The sound is great. Her singing is, of course, great. She tells entertaining/interesting stories between her songs. I'm not a super fan or even really a fan, but I did enjoy this DVD (and the live CD, too).
B008133MDK|5.0|I just started watching Sherlock with my Amazon Prime membership and I am in love with this version of Sherlock Holmes. Season 2 steps the story lines up which have translated Holmes for a modern audience while keeping the traditionalists eager for more. Every episode is a masterpiece of writing, acting and set!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|The product was really great, could not tell any difference from my PC. Responded very quickly even with a WIFI connection. Was especially pleased that it was a free app and with all the bells and whistles as I am used to.
B0000041A9|5.0|It doesnt get better than this!  The vinyl sounds better, but it will not work in my car.  Buy this set; you will love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love these characters! Never read a similar story....so unique. I'm very excited to keep reading! I can't stand the suspense...
B00BKTWBMA|3.0|I bought it because was only $3.99. For this money it worth any penny. In my opinion it deserves 3 and half stars. I was listening this album several time in my car and I can say it is a very good road companion. EC is not excelling in this one, but still he is doing fine music. You can listen and decide if you buy or not…
B003JHKORK|4.0|This moving is fun to watch. I would recommend it for children especially. It is light, funny and action packed.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. I read an article recently that this movie bombed in the theaters and made all of its money and became a classic from rentals and tv. Great movie, wonderful acting. A must see. I probably have seen this movie 20 plus times and always catch myself stopping to watch it when I see it playing on TV
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|Life of Pi was a beautiful movie. I laughed, cried and was glued to the screen. I now have to read the book!
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Good movie but the only reason I gave it 4 stars versus 5 is because the movie should've ended after boot camp.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This was a little hard to play on Kindle because of the small screen. This is better on a larger screen.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is one of my all time favorites and she steals the show. Really good, heart tugging movie even though he got drafted by the Baltimore Ravens I still give this movie 5 stars
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I love the game very addicting and fun easy but challenging.  My real only issue is I have to keep downloading the game (6+X in less then 5days).  If that didn't keep happening 5stars definitely so please fix the problem.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this free weather app. it gives accurate information. Add can be annoying but it is free so I'm not complaining.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I'm a little old fashioned. I like my good guys to be good guys and the bad guys bad. Dirty Harry may have been tough and no nonsense, but he was still a good guy. These people are so over the top they aren't entertaining, and that's what it's all about. I find them disgusting. They may be more real than most cops on television but reality isn't what I want when I'm watching a show. Michael Chiklis character on Vegas isn't as crooked as the cop he plays here. I watched half of the pilot and gave up.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|Exactly what I expected with this app. Very good for my creative preschooler who likes to make her own art.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show!!!! Can't stop watching it!! Already finished 3 seasons in just a few weeks. Love the story lines! Can't wait to see the next season!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app.  Better than the one I used one my gen 1 fire.  It is giving me problems looking at pics.  Looking at the goes ok but when I try to get back to news feed it won't sometimes and other times it takes a minute to do so.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very optimistic and achieving levels. keeps you wanting to play more and more. you would be very satisfied if you download this game. time well spent.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great story arc this season.  The characters have really developed over the years and this season shows how much they have grown.  The stand alone episodes are excellent as well.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|I liked this album more with the first few listens. Maybe that's because I was just so happy to hear a new Bowie release, but after letting it sink in, I have been mostly disappointed. Now, I rarely listen to it at all. To put my Bowie experience in context, the first album I bought upon release was Ziggy Stardust. I have seen every Bowie tour with the exception of two since then (I also saw Tin Machine). Suffice it to say I'm a huge Bowie fan.<br />But after a 10 year absence, I expected a deviation from the recent past. Clearly, he gives nods to the glorious past: The opening chords to the title track (one of the best cuts on the album) are reminiscent of Repetition from Lodger and the drum outro on You Feel So Lonely is strikingly similar to the drum intro on Five Years. But overall this album is a continuation from his last few...Reality, Heathen and Hours.<br />Additionally, with the exception of Tony Levin and David Torn (who seems to get lost in the mix) on selected cuts, Bowie pretty much utilizes his most recent band members. After ten years David, couldn't you shake things up with some new faces? Or maybe some quite old faces (Adrian Belew, Erdal Kızılçay, Carlos Alomar?) Maybe Iggy, Fripp or Eno on a couple of tracks? Anyways...<br />I've always highly respected Bowie as a writer and musician because he hasn't been afraid to change and try new things. He may have lost me along the way (Young Americans and Black Tie White Noise) but that's ok, I respected him for taking the chance to venture into new worlds.<br />It's not that The Next Day is a bad album, it's just that overall it's mediocre.  Where Are We Now is unlistenable. I heard it once and have no desire to hear it again. Dirty Boys is great, fresh and rocking, but then fades out in the middle of a hot sax solo. Huh?? There are momentary points of brilliance here, but few and far between. I wish I could rave about this album, I really do. My actual rating: 2 1/2 stars. Oh, and the album cover artis horrible. Visconti commented that it leaves a big blank area for autographs. Considering Bowie isn't going to tour, not much point in that apart from a select few.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I had already seen the movie, but could not put down the trilogy until I had finished all three books.  Can't wait for the second movie to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so if you love horses you need to get this its AWESOME!!! Plus also no glitches!!! Awesome app love it!!!!
B007X6SMD6|3.0|I hope is good to understand about aws services. I reccomend works with some example,like a &#34;Hello World&#34; in AWS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like the game a lot it is one of the better ones I came across in awhile good for all ages
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I like block moving games a lot.  This one is fun, however it gets hard pretty quickly.  I'm more into the relaxing, slightly challenging games.  But if you like block moving games it's worth a try.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a great series that I would recommend to almost anyone.  It is a good mix of comedy and drama.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The burdensome use of \\"eff\\" and \\"effing\\" mars the dialog. I don't say this as a moral issue, but an aesthetic one. For some reason too many writers seem to think that a truckload of the eff word adds some kind of reality or gritiness to the story--but it doesn't. The excess reflects the writers disresonance with theri (his/her) characters, and dilutes the speech of vatious characters with a sour solvent. Otherwise this movie is extremely well made. The acting is great, and the narration, point A to B to C, is top tier.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was a very nice boxed set and I enjoyed watching the movies again.  Sure, it's got some campy humor but that's part of what makes it funny & enjoyable to watch.  Can't go wrong with Indy, but I could do without all the annoying screaming in Temple of Doom from Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, the current Mrs.Spielberg (Sorry Steven!)  This is a very nice box set.
059306612X|5.0|I knew I wanted the book and Dawkins has definitely not disappointed. It's clever, witty, and very intelligent. I've had friends with kids come over and tell me they're going to buy it. The illustrations are great -- if you call them illustrations! Some are paintings, some are illustrations, and others are a mashup of photos, painting, sketching and so on. I absolutely love this book.<br /><br />Please note: Richard Dawkins is an atheist. This book is his version of a young adult/children's book explaining the magic of the world and universe as approached from a scientific point of view. I really enjoy his outlook but some definitely may not. Take this into consideration before you buy this book.<br /><br />Also, the seller was fantastic. It shipped so quickly and arrived much sooner than I thought it would since it was an international sale. The DJ seems like it was on a shelf rubbing against other books so it has some marks on it but I still think it's fantastic. Highly recommend!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Anyone who absolutely LOVES Sherlock Holmes will love this portrayal of the character.  It does have modern twists to it with a female Watson, NYC, and the drug rehab component, but it doesn't take away from the core attributes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's universe.  Jonny Lee Miller plays an excellent Holmes; my second favorite next to Jeremy Brett but that's probably because i don't think anyone has ever quite perfectly nailed Holmes as good as Jeremy Brett.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is really helpful. I like it because it's free and has a lot of great features. For example, you can make your list a checklist, and make the important words bold or italicized. Or you can use this to journal, because it helpfully remembers the date and title, so you can read notes you made YEARS ago. Another thing Evermore is great for is storing recipes. Overall this is a great app and I love and use it almost every day!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this game and recommend for anyone.  I find some of the layouts harder to distinguish the top tile so only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It is believable, a movie that I will watch again and again... It is a must see feel good movie.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love this app, but it isn't the latest version which I really want. I cannot wait for Amazon to update it as I want to start making my own magazine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the best book that I have read so far. I completely recommend this book because even though the price is a bit high, the book is worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts easy and gets tougher the more levels you go.  So easy to start playing and then find out an entire hour has passed. LOVE IT!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Cool my favorite character is Emma and my favorite part is when Emma awakens Henry because it's so unbelievably cute
B002NJWHHA|1.0|This movie was absolutely not like the book in more ways than i can count, not to mention some cheesy acting.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really like this game! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys having fun :) This game is so much fun that my daughter loves to play it also!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The movie was a great film for kids. I liked it as wells. There are some comedic scenes that had me laughing for hours
B000YAA68C|5.0|I suggest tissues!!!! Such a beautiful love story, only wish more men were actually like that! Definitively recommend this movie to everyone.
1400069807|4.0|I feel distinctly conflicted about Michael Moss' Salt Sugar Fat (c2013). Firstly and foremost a well-crafted and fun read, eye opening beyond education, flatly Awesome! At the same time it is spine tingly frightening, Stephen King quality horrifying in its description of the lengths the processed foods people will go to peddle us junk food. Ultimately fascinating to me is the craft, dare say sheer brilliance of these bastard's ploys. In terms of marketing these men must be admired and learned from. They looked at a challenge not in terms of specific solutions - It was about redefining the problem, making it simpler, reframing the most basic questions.<br /><br />Chief execs like Robert Woodruff at Coke who saw having a Coke as a part of every great moment in a person's life, and he should be there to sell them one. And Charles Mortimer at General Foods (who coined the term \\"convenience\\"), who in the late fifties told the food scientists from his struggling cereal division that they were thinking about the problem all wrong - You're in the \\"breakfast foods\\" business, not the cereal business, think outside the box (my choice of words) and forget about cereal for now. And the scientists did just that to great success, creating best sellers like Tang, instant breakfast drinks and Pop Tarts. The kid could now have cake and a sweet drink for breakfast, in addition to the usual selection of newer and even sweeter cereal brands. Cunningly smart scoundrels; they didn't sell product features, they bestowed lifestyle benefit. Yet all at once they must with equal vigor and vehemence be despised for their blatant disregard of public health, surely every bit a criminal as any drug dealer.<br /><br />To these execs no ethic was sacrosanct, even aggressively marketing directly to kids. No stone would be left unturned, and after they had us turned the right way inside the store they set loose the food scientists who leapt full reign into the brain science, tens of mil spent to find out what we could have guessed- What we each already knew deep in our bones - Sugar acted like a stimulant and Fat like an opiate exciting the very same pleasure centers in the brain as the drugs did, and salt smoothed out the in between, the up and down. Unilever's study said it, \\"Ice cream does make you happy.\\" It's official. They had discovered with focus groups and brain scans the `bliss point', and were learning to maintain it without exceeding sensory specific satiety; understanding the why we like things, and manipulating the mechanism of how we know when to stop eating. Flavors, textures, aromas and mouth feel were engineered with designer food additives (their long term health effects unknown), targeted like a laser to defeat the signal in our head, the signal that says \\"Enough!\\"  Instead we keep eating, becoming junkies for the stuff.<br /><br />All these disgraces are artfully wrapped by Moss in real stories of real events, and real people who were there, all humanized, or at least not demonized (Moss' narrative tone more amazed than outraged). Stories of dedicated corporate soldiers who cared about what they were doing and did the best job they could, most sounding unapologetic in the recap. To the contrary, they were proud of their contributions, although many ultimately soured with the sobering questions of morality.<br /><br />Like the story of a thoughtful and well-meaning VP from Kraft corporate named Michael Mudd, who got sat down at a meeting of industry leaders in 1999 for suggesting the large numbers of fat people who ate their salt sugar and fat laden stuff might present a public perception problem, and potential consumer backlash. He mentioned something about promoting exercise too. He was told, in a manner of speaking, to pipe down and not upset the apple cart. That consumer fads and preferences were current fancy, they would pass in time. There was no need to go crazy. \\"...Look, we're not going to screw around with the company jewels and change the formulations because a bunch of guys in white coats are concerned about obesity...\\" That was the gist of what Stephen Sanger, head of General Mills, had to say about it all.<br /><br />Astonishingly (or predictably not), the common industry view of what was needed had become and remains more and better sugars fats and salts. Ones more easily concealed with innocuous names like \\"Fruit Concentrate\\" - Which is still pure sugar, only then they could picture fruit on the wrapper, and feel better about it. The answer was to double down with more offerings, line extensions - Re-formulate retest re-launch, go go go.<br /><br />The new marketing paradigm wasn't as concerned with generating new users, it was modeled or more accurately formulated to promote existing customers to consume even more, and feel good about it as they did, or least not to feel bad - Brilliant! - Damn the torpedoes of public criticism, and the dangers of diets high in salt sugar and fat, and their calculable contribution to obesity. The answer was more, More MORE! Gun lobbies loved that one too.<br /><br />The processed food giants could have acted responsibly back then, at that 1999 meeting when Mudd gave them the hard facts. They could have come to an agreement to voluntarily lower the salt sugar fat content and address nutritional concerns. They could have avoided a foreseeable future of unnecessarily higher economic and social costs. It's easily imagined if they'd spent as much money on quality ingredients as they did on only a part of research and promotion, their stuff could be healthy and taste good, and we'd be farther along the road in dealing with the problem. Fourteen years later the arrogance stands magnified in skyrocketing obesity and diabetes numbers, and loudening demands for the industry to clean up its act. Sure too there'd be legal and legislative battles to be fought (ie NY Big gulp law), and the dreaded prospect of a sugar tax. Yet the players behave more irresponsibly than ever. The Philip Morris people could see a backlash coming. They'd been there before. It's why they sold off their food interests.<br /><br />The book could also be considered as precautionary tale, argued for the necessity of closer government oversight. That a private corporation left to its own device will act in its best interest, even if those interests are directly opposed to public wellbeing. The examples in the book support this proposition time and time again. They're not inherently evil entities; we just got to watch them. Certainly the book argues persuasively to the ineffectiveness and counter productiveness of the present legislative landscape and regulatory system. The form those regulations and enforcement should take involve thorny questions, both commercially and constitutionally sensitive, confused within the influence of big food's lobby.<br /><br />Maybe most poignant is the story of marketing guru and loyal Coke employee Jeff Dunn. He'd wanted to work at Coke since he was eight. His father Walter had worked at Coke, a legend there. Jeffrey only later became disgruntled. On a trip to Brazil in 2000, as he looked around a slum in Rio, the voice in his head said, \\"...`These people need a lot of things, but they don't need a Coke.' - I almost threw up. From that moment forward, the fun came out of it for me.\\"<br /><br />Dunn's lately been trying to promote a new product using the same considerable marketing skills he'd employed on Coke and Dew. That new product - Bags of Carrots. Just carrots, nothing added, no sugar coating or dipping sauce included. It will likely take all his considerable skill to make it work...God Bless him!<br /><br />It takes quite a while to overcome generational eating habits. It takes generations. It starts slowly, a bag of carrots here and there. Kids will eat what you tell them to eat, after a couple of days of hunger.nge the formulations because a bunch of guys in white coats are concerned about obesity...\\" That was the gist of what Stephen Sanger, head of General Mills, had to say about it all.<br /><br />Astonishingly (or predictably not), the common industry view of what was needed had become and remains more and better sugars fats and salts.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app its perfect for me, every time I charge it pops up! So user friendly! You can't go wrong!
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is goes into great detail in how certain foods effect the body. I learned so much to help with my new healthy lifestyle!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a an excellent book from the start. Your personal like drifts from Nick, Amy, Nick, etc. as you turn every page. With every chapter you discover something you never thought of before. I praise Gillian Flynn for creating a book not like all murder cliches. It does have some foul, very sexual language. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like that it reads to you also the font is a good size. But the voice could be  little better also you have to be able to get WI fi if you are out an about an want to read it. I have to wait to get home to read it due to it won't download if not in a good area for the internet.
B007HC3LHS|1.0|A very bad book. The continuity is not there. Nobody can be that gullable. Trash it! It is pure smut.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent!  Fast paced with a great plot. Love Harry Bosch who is one of my favorite detectives.<br />Also, Michael Connelly is one of my favorite writers.
B009KEN87O|3.0|I would have given this a 5 except that there are 2 levels on each mode that require you to negotiate through a channel. On the Kindle Fire (1st gen.) the channel doesn't show up. In fact, I didn't know it was supposed to show up until my husband also got it & put it on his tablet. I've tried an assortment of brightness settings to no avail. You only see a black screen with your ship & white ships flying toward you. Those white ships are the only sort of clue you have as to where the walls are. Basically you're flying blind. And you can't skip it and go on. You're just stuck there until you can, mostly by sheer luck, manage to pass the level. I've managed to pass 3 of them, but I became pretty disgusted by the 4th one & just quit trying for awhile.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Felt the rating was fair. It moves a little slow. I preferred Tom Clancy's early books more. I'm not sure that I would recommend it.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I heard Emmy in a tv interview, but I don't remember where.  I just know her voice was lovely and her selections from the past were comforting to hear again.  I usually don't use the TV or CD player for music, just my car radio while driving.  Her talented production of these lovely songs has intrigued me enough to have hers playing at home.  Thank you Emmy.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is a great app.  I no longer have to worry about missing a payment on a bill because it reminds me automaticly.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'm sorry but this app is just crap. I have only got the app load once. Looks like others are having similar issues. Deleted.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I forgot how wonderful and suspenceful the first season of Fring was.<br />Walter is the best.  The relationship between everyone is very magnetic.
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|I'm not eloquent, but Pink is. His stories and explanations are very empowering and are helpful to all the non-salespeople who have to sell their classes to students, their causes to friends and relations, etc. I strongly recommend this book for everyone who's been discouraged about trying to promote and idea or activity.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|i think its pretty cool,a great rpg for a tablet gives the game player a good pass time that is worth the money,not many glitches after it warms up,great app i recommend to any video game enthused,or busy travler.....i give it a thumbs up!!!
B0064MGU98|2.0|I only watched part of the first episode because I was curious about all the hype.  This show seemed to do its best to instill a constant undercurrent of anxiety, and I don't watch shows to become depressed.  I also had the same impression of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, so this is simply a personal preference on my part.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I like how everyday you get a new challenge! ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!! I definitely recommend it to everyone!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I enjoy the &#34;outside the box&#34; story lines that push the envelope of our current beliefs regarding the human mind and what is indeed possible.  Have only seen the first few episodes, but I also like how each episode is linked by previous events to previous shows, yet each one can stand alone.  Yes, I was (and still am) a fan of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, even when it suffered a few missteps, so I like the quirkiness.  Plan to continue watching, and only regret I hadn't started sooner.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Depeche Mode.  I had heard a few of these songs live on a Letterman and SXSW.  I could not WAIT to get my hands on this disc.  Sooth My Soul and Soft Touch/Raw Nerve are probably my favorite tracks.  Looking forward to seeing the boys back on stage rockin it like only DM can.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and super addicting. I cant get enough of it with its updates and powers I love. it
B000A0K2JO|5.0|I thought this was something different so I ordered it. Upon receiving it I realized it was the wrong connection but decided to keep it on my coffee table as a piece of artwork.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow, it makes a person feel SMART.....and allows a person to ck off their accomplishments.  My grandkids shared this with me and now I am a granny with play.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The original charging cable seemed to suddenly start to crumble and fall apart.  I contacted Amazon as I had some concerns that this could possibly be unsafe and they give me a credit to replace the cable.  I've been very pleased with this one and it looks like it should hold up for a long long time.  I'm not sure if the original cable was defective, but it's nice of Amazon to replace it.  Thanks!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved this movie very cute. My kids enjoyed laughing at the silliness! Watch it! I rate it 5 stars for bring my family closer!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My only question is why did Amazon not include this fast charger with the original Kindle purchase? The original charger was very slow and then did not work at all.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Another classic in this soon to be 3-book series. Pre-ordered the new one to be released in just a few days.
0345529057|5.0|Received product very quickly.<br /><br />It was just as promised, brand new and shrink wrapped.<br /><br />Comes in a nice book holder to protect the books and keep them together; suitable for shelf display.
B008476HBM|4.0|Book was very enjoyable. Easy to see how the British comedies got their start. it's important to visualize the characters in the book.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is good to keep my brain active and sharp.  It is just challenging enough so that I am  not bored.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Some of the scenes in this movie hit a little too close to home - for many of us I would suspect.  Definitely a movie middle age parents can relate to. Great acting with a goofy plot but it all works.  It did drag on a little toward the end but overall it's a great movie . but make sure the kids are out of pocket when you watch.
B007G51UV0|2.0|I bought 2 of these boards.  One had bent pins and was sent back.  The other installed fine and worked for a couple months.  Out of nowhere I started noticing an overall slowness that should not be there with multiple SSD drives, DDR 2133 memory and an i7 3770k processor.  Wouldn't you know, I swapped in a different motherboard and my machine was back to normal.  Not sure if there was a malfunctioning sata port(s) or memory controller or both or something else, but that made me 0 for 2 with this board and I can't see myself going back to it again.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|As you mature you look for movies to have more substance, and this film has a message<br />which makes it appealing to me. One of the most disturbing things about many of the current<br />cinematic offerings is that they don't hold your attention, and the story line lacks focus.<br /><br />This film has a great story line and it displays an intelligent well done project which does not make you wish that you<br />had not wasted your time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am sad the way this season ended!! Waiting for the next season. So far this is the best TV series I have ever watched.
B002T45VX6|3.0|I bought this because I love Zumba and some of the music is Shakira. While some of it is good, I find her annoying to listen to for a whole CD, she does that thing where her voice is all in her nose and I just can't listen. I realize pop music is not based on great vocal technique, but still, an ugly sound is an ugly,sound. Will be trading it in at the local used shop.
B0042L78MG|5.0|The first time I put this CD on, it went straight to my top ten list! This is a gorgeous album - fun, cheeky, enjoyable. I can't put into words how wonderful this album is. The whole family love it and sing along to it.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|I love going to Zumba classes, so this CD makes the car ride seem like part of the dance party. &#34;Naughty&#34; lyrics by my age are just funny and make me feel young again, it is not that vulgar but I suppose parents should make that choice. Bouncy, happy fun music!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a fun cool game. Easy to play and challenging. I enjoy playing it. I love the graphics on my kindle, it makes it so much more fun to play a game! If your into games that are interesting I have several from Playrix LLC and I enjoy them all. They have good games.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I live soundtracks and this one is worth owning! Fantastic extras that are really worth the cash! This is a must-own for anyone who enjoys concert and symphonic music.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Simply addictive! Great scripts and a gifted cast! Thanks to Amazon Prime I have enjoyed watching the first three seasons on my Kindle Fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so great, such a different style of story telling, so unpredictable, i wish there was more story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best Bingo out there!! It's so much fun even my five year old niece love's to play it with me, she repeats the numbers for me in each of the accent.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow puts together another great war story in Zero Dark Thirty. It's well cast, and it's a well told story. The middle drags just a bit, but the end makes up for it.
B005ETANC2|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore. Brought back a lot of great memories of my youth and these types of movies didn't need all of today's special effects to make you a little afraid to walk home in the dark.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book as it was not your typical love story. It had many unexpected surprises and I love the way it ends.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Where to start? Is it visually impressive (sometimes)?- Yes, and considering the budget it damn well ought to be.<br />But is it a good film? Does it tell a good story, and does it tell it well?- No. Sadly I would have to say it does not. For those who have either never read Victor Hugo's &#34;Les Miserables&#34;, have not finished it all the way through, or have but did not fully understand it- I highly recommend to stay away from this version lest you judge the novel and the true meaning of the story based on this version alone and have it turn you away from reading the novel in full or diminish your interest in the works of Victor Hugo. Watch the 1998 version film with Liam Neeson before judging &#34;Les Miserables&#34;!<br /><br />  This film is truly based on something that was based on the original work- and it shows. Even as a musical it is not very good in my opinion as the singing is not that great throughout and even rather bland in places. The musical  aspects of this film just seemed very forced. Most of the actors did not fit their roles aside from a few, and the film places much too much importance on the LEAST important aspects of the story- such as religion and the importance and intervention of the supernatural, human suffering, the importance of &#34;the state/culture&#34; and &#34;the country&#34; over the individual, and most of all the Thénardiers- who are depicted as low-lifes, liars, dishonest scoundrels, and thieves- BUT depicted so in a very nonchalant, off-hand, comedic and even merry sort of way which is completely wrong and improper as they are &#34;the scum of the earth&#34; in the most profound way possible. Murderers, liars, thieves, war, famine, poverty, and all human suffering are but second worst to the Thénardiers- who are the driving force behind all those things.<br /> Inspector Javert is also not given enough time nor importance in the film. Being depicted simply as a somewhat pompous &#34;righteous&#34;/&#34;god-loving&#34; man who simply wants Valjean back in prison as a side concern instead of being a man who truly does have much good, righteousness, and a sense of right and wrong; is even heroic, admirable, and lovable in a way, and is so completely devoted to his duty that he is willing to go to hell and back to do the right thing- but is still evil. But those are NOT the reasons WHY he is evil. He is NOT the villian of Les Miserables, he is NOT the main evil- the oppression of the mind of man is, and the Thénardiers- the little lowlife cockroaches who make it all possible and continue to perpetuate it are.<br /><br />  All in all, even though the critics will most likely rave and praise it for &#34;powerful, raw, 'explosions of emotion' &#34;, &#34;a sense of intense 'intensity' &#34;  and it will be nominated for many awards- this is a very second rate retelling of Hugo's Les Miserables. Please watch the 1998 film first before you see this and it puts you off from reading Hugo by boring you to death or curbing your interest in the same way your mother or grandmother might have done when you were a wide-eyed curious child full of wonder about the world and asked an important question about something only to have them respond: &#34;I don't know! That's just the way things are!&#34; or &#34;Because I said so!!&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The new subway surfer is awesome I thought that the new Subway Surfers would be in Paris but it is not is in Sydney
1935597760|5.0|Some of the best books I've read are also some of the saddest ones.  I couldn't put this one down.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|because I saw the film, and ordered the DVD due to that fact.  I have always loved the story of Les Miserables, and became familiar with the music when PBS showed what was the 10th anniversary production which, at the end, featured many of the actors who, worldwide, had played Valjean, and they sang in their native languages.  Since then, I eagerly awaited the film, and I went to see it opening week, and wasn't at all disappointed.  Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and the rest of the cast were wonderful, and I even disagree with many of the negative reviews of Russell Crowe.  True, he wasn't the strongest of the cast in terms of singing, but he lent a wonderful presence to the role of Javert.  I particularly loved little Gavroche.<br />Some of the book was truncated, but what can you do with a book that can be used, alternately, as a doorstop?  Still, they got the spirit and the grace of Hugo's indictment of the treatment of the poor and oppressed.  The music was wonderful.<br />I noticed on IMDB some complaints about this fact, so to let all who read this know, this is in &#34;opera&#34; form.  There is no dialog, only song.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana is a very talented music men and I would buy his cd any time because it is a good music
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I bought this for the appearance of the pre-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe, as I read that this production was one of the factors in casting him in the Potter movies.  I can see why; he was charming as young David, and was missed as David grew up, even though the actor playing the adult David was quite good.  Maggie Smith, as ever, is flawless.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game. I spend a lot of money on it but love it. have trouble with some of the quests.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I had to rent the movie twice because the first download wouldn, stream kept stalling. Rented it several days later and it worked one.<br /> I enjoyed the movie very much especially since I remember the seeing this surfer and reading about him when he was alive and after his death
B000SEIK2S|5.0|IMO, this was a little slow to start with. Kind of like visiting a nursing home and hearing elderly people cracking jokes. I have to admit that I am a little envious of older people though for the simple fact that they're usually so witty and cynical. But once the action starts it doesn't stop. The tech this guy came up with is in incredible and this second chance at life idea is a really great touch.  I admit that I haven't read too much military scifi, which I'm correcting now since reading this novel, Starship Troopers, and The Forever War. I'm really loving this genre.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|It's my fault to mistake it as the &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; so I can't blame anyone for my disappointment.<br /><br />The new movie does add some &#34;modern&#34; effects, more violence, more blood, more terrorists ...<br /><br />But some real stuffs are missing and the story is so boring I gave it up after about 40 minutes.<br /><br />Consider my $4.99 a waste.<br /><br />Will avoid any movies from this director.
B004LQA6MQ|5.0|Again this is one of 3 Alien movies that my husband and I wanted to watch in a row, one a night, but could only find all three in Amazon Prime. Glad we did lots of fun and very scary.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|I like this hotmail app more than gmail app since I don't have an unlimited data plan.  Gmail app maintains no local copy for deleted or archived messages so you can't access them when you don't have an internet connection. The problem? You have only two big buttons on the screen when you open a message: Delete and Archive.<br /><br />My problem with the Hotmail app is that it will not sync the &#34;read&#34; or &#34;unread&#34; state of messages. The &#34;unread&#34; messages and &#34;notification&#34; will stay there even I already read them with other devices (computers).
B0064QNS62|4.0|It plays like Mario and donkey Kong. The only problems I see  so far is<br />You die from a short fall and you must light up every block to finish the level. With a few tweaks this game could easily become a 5star :)
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pros:<br />- Works well when it works<br />- Everything loads well.<br />- Basically an exact copy of the mobile site<br />- If someone uploads to an album, you can scroll through the upload and not have to go load the entire album.<br />- If you want to comment on something you can tap on &quot;comment&quot;, comment, then there is a little tab thing that you can pull down to close the dialog box for the status. Making it quicker to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- VERY big data hog. You will have to clear your cache almost everyday depending on how much you have done.<br />- Crashes about 25% of the time on startup. (Once its running there are usually no problems)<br />- Notifications are somewhat slow to appear<br />- Pictures are slow to appear in the news feed. (That might just be my wifi)<br />- Always runs in the background. (some people might think that it slows down the device. but it doesn't really do anything to my kindle fire. some people think this as a con, so I labeled it as such)<br /><br />Overall, This is a good app to use for facebook. It has minor negative things, but the pros outweigh the cons. I would recommend this app to a friend.<br />Device used for review: Kindle Fire 7.0 (original, not HD)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|After a while, the monster of the week format used in the first season becomes tiring. However, the last few episodes really get your attention and make you excited for the second season. The overarching &#34;ZFT&#34; story-line really helps to pull the story together. If you focus upon that story-line, the first season of Fringe becomes much more enjoyable, rather than a slow build-up to a cliffhanger season finale.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|First of all I always liked the star of the show. Margolise.She was superb on ER.. Actually there all terrific.  The story lines, are exciting. I like that it shows her as a single mom,trying to get along on her own , and doing a great job of it. As a lawyer in a high powered law firm, every episode you find yourself cheering for her.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you know a person ...you don't. A look at a marriage you'll never believe.  And wonder about your own...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm only about 10 chapters into the book (in 2 days) but so far it does not disappoint.  I love the intrigue and the love story that continues...and of course, the really really hot sex.  Can't wait to find out what happens next!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the series, and immediately bought the Shift Omnibus once I was finished with it. It's one of those books that you totally get immersed in; the Silo world is intense and addicting, and it's impossible not to read &#34;just ONE more chapter.&#34;  Very well written, so interesting and entertaining, and you can't really ask for more than that! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and good for young kids but also for adults. Its a great game but they are just copying temple run 2
6304698690|5.0|I read the book and wanted to compare the movie. This one was well done and very close to the actual book.
B00C0YQLDE|4.0|Still getting used to it, but I have a soft spot for Black Sands.  I expect any remixes to come from North Borders to eclipse the album versions...
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game. wish is was a little easier to leavel up in but other than that it is a fun game.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|but they're albums have stayed the same while i've grown up.  I'm preferring the remixes to the album versions already.  Still good writing.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|At first glance I had to wonder if this guy could act but on further watching Arrow and the rest of the cast and crew really come together to make a wonderful show:-)  Can't wait to see what's in store for Arrow in Season 2:-)
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Love it.... that is all........ yea. I guess i need more words... la la la la la la la. Lol
0002247275|5.0|Other than the outstanding Farseer Trilogy this book has to be by far one of my favorites of Robin Hobb's, as it is just so addictive and compelling reading. I was glued to the pages throughout the early hours of the morning, reading until my vision went blurred for I was entirely swept away by this powerful tale. I am constantly amazed by Hobb's abilities at the top of her craft and how she keeps producing such astonishing novels, with exciting stories even more enchanting than ever before. I would highly recommend this refreshingly original masterpiece filled with magic, adventure, drama and interesting characters to all who love this genre.<br /><br />`The Golden Fool' is the second installment within `the tawney man' series, which continues on from `Fool's Errand' and Fitz story. Fitz and the Fool have succeeded in returning Prince Dutiful to the castle, but with protecting the Farseer bloodline comes at such a great loss - his partner in the Wit, the wolf Nighteyes is dead. The death of such a significant character really hit me inwardly and I found myself in tears, as I recalled the intensely strong bond between man and animal (which made the Farseer trilogy so magical). Whilst Fitz soon takes on the role as Manservant to Lord Golden, Queen Kettricken becomes restless and outside forces threaten to harm all those dear and closest to Fitz. With a quest to slay an Outislander Dragon and a journey to locate the skill-users and uncover the mystery hidden within the ancient skill-scrolls, this is a complex story containing many different adventures within. I like how the author has several characters tackling their own challenges, making it much more fascinating than the usual main character sole focus.<br /><br />Full of heated conflict and dark magic, family blood-bonds and detailed history this is an impressive work of epic proportions and substance. Robin Hobb's world-building, including the land of the Six Duchies together with the Farseer family history is simply stunning, with such in-depth background detail as to rival the likes of Tolkien. Utterly believable and realistic, this is a world in which you not only loose yourself within but become entwined within the lives of each character that are acutely memorable. Fitz' world is as real to me as my own, with the Farseer bloodline being as dear to me and familiar as my own family; this is a testimony to how great a writer she is.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sensational encounter with a timeless fantasy creation, then look no further, as Robin Hobb stands-out from many other writers within this highly competitive genre.mply stunning, with such in-depth background detail as to rival the likes of Tolkien.

B004PIOYIW|1.0|Stanley Kubrick made this right before The Shining, and they are two stinkers. This one is so tedious, so slow, so lacking in a story, such an exercise in money wasting, I suppose it drove Kubrick to get &#34;creative&#34;and ruin Stephen King's fantastic novel.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Kept me engrossed until the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this trilogy and highly recommend to others.  Worth every dollar!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I'm surprised no one has picked up on \\"No Name Jam\\" with Hendrix as the instrumental track for a song I've seen on Youtube called \\"White N**ger\\"[I didn't think I could say it on Amazon].Its not a disrespect at least in my mind!!!Its a great Stills vocal,check it out and let me know if I'm wrong.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Anyone who has even an eleventh grade knowledge of  la langue francaise will be astonished by the grammatical errors and incorrect tenses that the author uses with ignorant abandon. Did she never consider using a dictionary or perhaps a French speaking editor ? When writing in a foreign tongue it does well to know how to speak it gracefully and correctly. This writer does neither and the book is an absolute JOKE.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game so so so so so so so fun and many charachters or people to choose from . But too many adds .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Purchased the Kindle version to read on a cruise. By the middle of the second day at sea, I had finished the book.  It kept my attention as I liked the characters and storyline. Not N. Sparks best, but a good read nonetheless.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|What's touching about this book is how sincere Charlie is about his feelings.  While a self discovery story, the reader leaves feeling both the happiness as well as the uncertainty that life offers.  Charlie is faced with both the positive and negative side of going through life seeing things far to literally with no blinders.  While the novel ends with Charlie coming to some conclusions with what makes him the way he is by no means is this truly a happy ending and that is ok.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love music videos for there unique ability to bring out a persons style and broune there freedoms in life it is a power that only the current generion can fully adopt and copertion so when I foun this I had to get it

B0064QNS62|1.0|As a 7th generation Chinese coal miner, I am offended! I was born in the mine, like my mom just squatted and dropped me out, gave me a pick axe and off to work I went! I have never seen a guy named Marv in the mines, let alone a white guy! Only the bosses are white, and they don't go in the mines, they are too busy playing with their faotd! Please update so we can play as a guy named Chan, or Jet, maybe Bruce. Also, please change the jewels to bowls of chow mien. Thanks!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, it WAS Grisham quality but so unlike his others.  I was confused most of the time, wondering  where on earth he was going with all of this.  It was good.  I liked it.
B001974DG0|5.0|I love love love this book. Read it many years ago. I would take my lunch break at work and just go read this book. It was torture waiting until lunch to read more. It is one of those books where you so want to get to the end to see how things turn out, but at the same time, you never want it to end...you don't want to leave these characters. I enjoyed being a spectator of their lives. And I just fell in love with Einstein, the golden retriever. I had always wanted a golden retriever and this made me want one of these amazingly sensitive and intelligent dogs even more. Dean Koontz is a great story teller.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|This was the book I didn't know I needed. Every chapter I was saying \\"yes, exactly\\" and / or \\"doh, what was I thinking!\\". I have fresh enthusiasm for Leaning In to my career and it's great to be back!
B00AYMKUOK|5.0|I love how these books flow and keep right on moving along.  These books never disappoint.  Now the very long wait until the next book comes out.  Loved this book!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I could not put the book down. The story is cute and touching. I loved the main character and her whole family. I liked th eending as well.
B0095P31L6|1.0|How in the world did this movie get anything resembling 4 stars!  It was ridiculously stupid.  The worst part was the journey of Rango from a thespian to a hero.  Why was it the worst? Because there was no journey!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I really liked the first book b u t this one was like 'reading filler material. Don't t think I'll buy the next one
B0013D6LEM|5.0|A great Album from a great artist. One of Mchael Jacksons all time best albums. A fan greatest song Thriller is included on this album
B004W89LS8|5.0|This Album is incredible. You won't ever skip a track and play it through several times. I bought this the day it came out on itunes and recently purchased the deluxe version for 35 bucks from MasterDVD. MasterDVD did a great job sending it over in mint condition, but I was upset that my piece of the master tape was missing. It was the reason (a dumb reason) i bought it instead of vinyl. NOT MasterDVD's fault but if you're thinking about dishing 35 out for this I'd suggest you just buy the regular 9.99 cd or the $20 dollar vinyl (either will give you the mp3 version for free courtesy amazon autorip and unfortunately MasterDVD will not).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson loaded this onto my Kindle and love it.  The music doesn't annoy me and I like the graphics. It's just fun. Playing it is helping me keep from so much snacking on my Weight Watchers program!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show, but definitely not for kids.  Some adult situations and things, but it is a very interesting and unique show.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the first Angry Birds that I have actually purchased and it is much more fun than the free ones I've played before. Lots of neat scenarios.
1250012570|5.0|enjoyed the story of two young people - none of us actually &#34;fit in&#34; - lucky to find the one love.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Since we got into the series late and were trying to catch up, we got most episodes from Netflix.  For those that had a long waiting period, a friend suggested getting them on the Kindle.  It was great!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Well directed, well-acted and shows the tedious nature of the war on terror in terms of CIA tracking down the people they're trying to find. There are torture scenes that are tough to watch, so be forewarned.<br /><br />And if you haven't yet seen The Hurt Locker, rent it immediately, it's an amazing movie by the same director.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a well written sci-fi with interesting characters surviving in a post-apocalyptic world.  It was perfectly paced, never boring. I'm really looking forward to reading the next book  'The Shift Omnibus'.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I hadn't read a Jane Austen book in decades, and had never read Persuasion, but am so glad I did, I loved it!  With just a few changes It could be set in the 21st century just as well as the 19th century. Communication, or lack thereof, caused problems in relationships then, and causes them now.  And I loved reading this book because it provides such insight into life in early 19th century England, or at least life for the &#34;upper classes&#34;. Highly recommend it!
B001MSMULG|4.0|Thought this was a riveting book.  Gabriel is one of my favorite characters.  It does make you think a lot about current events and what we read in the news.
B00AQCMK32|3.0|I liked the game until I realized that there wasn't a way to win without purchasing stuff for REAL money.  So...3 stars
B008AU7F3C|5.0|I purchased this on iTunes and loved it, I've heard her previous albums as well and as a long time fan, I assure that fans will fall in love and all over again fall in love with Bat for Lashes.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really enjoy this mellow game...challenging but relaxing. Lovely colors and unique sound effects make for a great way to relax after a long day.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Haven't enjoyed a novel that much in a while. The discussion of intelligence throughout made me think about how lucky I am to be so smart.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I definitely think it's worth watching at least once.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I was chastised by my nerdy peers for having not read this book in my younger years, so I got a copy for Kindle to make up for my apparent mistakes.  I was glued!  I'm sorry I hadn't it years sooner--the ideas presented in this book will give you pause.  Its easy to see how a great deal of technology fiction and science fiction has been influenced by this story.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Shows how complex Pres.Lincoln was and how difficult the decision was for him and for the country. No matter what the reasons were to end the evil system of slavery, Lincoln was the only one with the courage to challenge and defeat that wicked practice.
B008M7JODC|5.0|I didn't know much about this until my wife stumbled upon it.  We absolutly love the show and its quirky charactors!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This season is great. I guess I can see why some people have a problem with it, but I really enjoyed it. I am so glad it is available on Amazon prime viewing because I am working on a paper right now about Doctor Who and it makes the series easy to watch online with my co-writer. Thanks for adding this to the Prime Library!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|have to keep waiting to get free lives or buy them. buying lives does not make it a free game.

B00ARAO720|3.0|this is a hang onto to your butts and lets go for a ride movie. Its fun in all aspects of it. even watching that stupid cop get his stupid butt....well lets not ruin it for the kids now shall we.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|This game is taking forever because you have to plod through redundant and rediculous conversations between the characters. A little convo is fine if it has to do with the plot, but we don't by these games to keep tapping the screen just to readin a pointless convo. Just get to the puzzle already!!<br />Once you get to the puzzles, they're good.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|I hoped this would have been more directed to the seargent and his helmet finally coming off. Yes it was a lets get the kids to grow up and move through hard times moving. A definite pulling ones head out of ones...well lets just it didnt stink. I hope the next has more livliness to it but a good romp none the less.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|bECAUSE i HAVE FAITH IN AN AFTERLIFE.  BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY HONEST ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AND TOLD ABOUT IT WHICH IS COMMENDABLE.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl's valentine to a studio that managed, seemingly against all odds, to be a dominant player in the recording studio business in the 70s, 80s and 90s.  Dave Grohl narrates the history of Sound City from the perspective of a participant as well as a rabid fan.  It's satisfying to know that someone as passionate about analog recording as Grohl managed produce this fine tribute and salvaged the legendary Neve console at its heart.  The film features many candid interviews with key players, some famous, some obscure, all entertaining.  The doc features many new performances recorded in Grohl's studio with the aforementioned Neve. One of my favorites is &#34;Your Wife Is Calling&#34; featuring the lead singer of Fear.
0062082353|5.0|Both my husband and my son loved it. Can't wait to read it myself, if I every get it back.
B000089RVX|5.0|Back in 2003, a cousin of mine said to me: \\"Oh, you like Metallica, right? Listen to this.\\" So, at first I was like \\"What the hell, man?! This doesn't even sound anywhere near like heavy metal.\\" But after paying attention to the music, the lyrics and the vocals, I was compeled to go and buy this album. It's been 10 years and I still enjoy every single song in this record.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was hesitant to read this on the heels of having read the 50 Shades trilogy.  Didn't think it would compare.  Upon recommendation from a friend I relented and bought the book.  Despite some similarities with 50 shades that I found annoying, I ended up falling in love with the characters and the storyline.  Finished it inside of 24 hours and immediately bought the second book.  Can't wait til June for the 3rd installment.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie!!  Great family entertainment.  A must have to your movie collection and the ocean scenes were excellent..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was definitely as good as the first in this story line.  Can't wait for the 3rd book!  A very quick read.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I think I've watched this series 5 times already and I'm watching it all the way through again. I wish it was still going!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but I think It will be better if they had an upgrade.Maybe Redstone and a lever and flint and steel. Kids want upgrades plz agree with me.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Much better than I expected. There were some things that they had to put in to make it a good story but it was a good movie nonetheless.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is nice to know where the battery is at in percentages. It was always  hard to guess how much battery I had left with the battery bar at the top of my kindle.
B00BVVA138|5.0|I've always been a Jesse Leach fan. I never did like Howard Jones as much and this album proves Jesse is a better singer and front man. So glad he's back and I'm hoping many more killer albums from Killswitch Engaged!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers for kindle fire the game got addicting right hen I started playing<br />I've subway surfers is the best game ever knockoff hmm bbgun sometimes I'm random
B001EC3JME|3.0|Good idea for a product, the swivel and lock stops that stop it at each point became a little loose. The elastic and actual torch pouch seemed to maintain reasonable tight, I never lost my torch. Great for on your belt as it will move to a better position if you squat or move around.
B009K86D86|5.0|Shocking at times, disgusting, but certainly opened my eyes about the American food industry.  Definitely a conversation-starter! Would recommend to anyone with an interest in health, economics, corporate-driven economies, and food.
B008ROG6E0|4.0|I first saw this movie as a teenager (and I won't tell you how long ago that was), so you can't expect the special effects of today.  For what's it's worth, I enjoyed and movie then and did again as a 50-something.
B003L77G38|5.0|This excellent product has arrived just on time as they promised. Video quality was outstanding with a very reasonable price. I strongly reccommend this product to all potential buyers.<br />Levent
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The updates erase all of your data and it is bad because it only updates if you erase the app then 're download it. You should tell people that before they get the app.
0061914177|5.0|the book arrived in a very fast manner. it was in great condition. there is a bit wear on the cover, but all the pages are in very good condition
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play all the time. But would like to see a different scoring system.  It seems like I always get 1480 for a score.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game but is was short for five bucks. good story.good puzzles .the demo let you play for awhile
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game is too expensive to play. I'm sorry I downloaded it.  I wish it had a free game to play then I could sometimes play the others but everything costs you money.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|too large an application.  Takes up too much memory and is slow.  Uninstalled it after trying to use it in a week.  Caused crashes.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Fun! Can't wait for new levels! Graphics are cute, sounds aren't annoying, animals are fun, great colors and exciting scenery. Get this game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is really fun I play it all the time and I always end up playining for like two to three hours I lovenit
B007SGM084|5.0|Not what I expected but it was interesting.<br />Makes fantasy more realistic. A little frightening but shows that an alternative life style can be exciting.
B0050KVCES|5.0|Happy with the purchase. Great seller. Listening to the album now. Having a tough time responding to this question because I'm listening to the album right now.<br /><br />Could you ask me to rate this product again on Saturday?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Kim
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Excellent view of a Seal sniper and his wife with a family at war. Shows the changes that take place in the mind of a Seal as he does to war and has to make a choice between his love of his family and his devotion to his fellow warriors. If you live, you question why? If you fail to re-enlist you are turning your back on your fellow troups. Why did I live and my friends died. Your family is the one that gets the short end if you return to the battle.
B005K17RU0|4.0|very accurate and super simple to use.  The new format is a bit of a pain, but is worth it - very informative.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Easy read; written in a conversational style.<br />Many interesting historical and technical anecdotes. Even airplane buffs don't know some of these stories.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this, is the size of the world's, as they seem pretty small, and the limited amount of crafting items. Also, it may just be me, but I can't join people. It continuously says that it's searching for other WiFi servers.
B00AF6B22E|3.0|I like Washington's acting, but this role and subject matter were a little too farfetched to be believable.  Find some cheaper way to see it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse arrived on time and works very well. My bf wanted this mouse for regular use. He's not a gamer. Moving on i luv the design and how well it fits in both our hands its very comfy. Very smooth gliding across the mouse pad i luvvv it its soo freaking cute
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|It was entertaining and had some exciting moments, but it wasn't close enough to what actually occurred for me.  Good nonetheless.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|i watch this movie it one of the greatest film i ever saw it has family value plus it has lot of couple kissing. the kissing scene is so juicy that i started to get HORNY!!! I WATCH THOSES KISSING SCENE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I STARTED TO MAKEOUT WITH A PILLOW THIS HOW JUICY IS THE MOVIE .<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE YOU WILL GET HORNEY WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND START TO MAKE OUT WITH PILLOWS
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|It was an &#34;okay&#34; movie, it entertained me, but I'm glad that I didn't pay $20 to see it at the theater.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show combines all the best flavors of Sci-Fi: Apocalypse, Aliens, War, Science and History.<br /><br />(five more words were required)
B009AMANH4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it definitely had some &#34;flat spots&#34; in it.  Both Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields share several powerful scenes.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Although I met the cast Of the big bang theory in 2009. I have never seen one episode Until January 2013.  I wish that I knew then, what I know now . I would have asked for autographs and tried to get a picture with each and every one of them. All the characters are very lovable , and the actors, directors, writers do such a wonderful job that I am happy to call myself a fan of The Big Bang Theory
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Doesn't load right. Have been unable to view any pdfs.  Can't move from the instruction page. App works well on phone, but not on kindle.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A really weird book.  I wish I was able to have figured out one part and happy I was not.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Intelligent, briskly paced.  Fine sense of humor. Modern, with appropriate nod to its Conan Doyle roots. Holmes, Watson, Moriarty nicely cast.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|This was the free app of the day so I gave it a try. Very enjoyable until I beat it in two days. Only 30 levels and many are not all that difficult.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved this book!  It was interesting to read the background of things we are all familiar with: computer, ipod, microsoft, etc.  Steve was a brilliant man but horrible at the same time.  He treated people terribly without any guilt or shame.  I was surprised at how mean he was to even his closest friends.  But I also learned the importance of building an &#34;A&#34; team.  He could not have done what he did without them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I hope they keep pumping out new music!!! This is my wife's all-time favorite band!!! She can listen to the old or new music. It never gets old.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|It shows all my local stations, but none of them are &quot;available&quot;. What's the deal? I used to love this app.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|It is still the number one show on TV and Computers around here. The cast is one of the finest that have gotten together.
B0006VBFM0|3.0|Its a very pretty watch, but the plastic strap aren't of good quality. I bought it as a present for my sister, and the straps started to peel off like 2 weeks after I gave it to her. Other than that, its a very cool watch.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I enjoy reading and this allows me to have mini vacations while waiting for appointments.  I can have my book and read it too....home or out and about
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love My Alarm Clock.  Not only do I get up on time now but I get to wake up to my favorite music chose by me.  I love the settings and I use it everyday.
B0064QNS62|2.0|It looks great, has great sounds/music, plays at a decent enough speed to enjoy, but the controls need some work.  In this type of game the jump button should be just a single dedicated jump button.  The jump-left, jump-up, jump-right combo has killed me more often than anything else.  I run left and accidentally hit the jump-right, when I was trying for the up, jumps me right back into a monster I was running away from.  Thanks devs for the suicide.  Too annoying to play.  Uninstall until fixed.  Glad it was the FAOTD.
B009K86D86|4.0|it is an informative movie and reminds us the corp greed.<br />It is time we do some soul searching about our diet and lift style..<br />it is sad the more technological advance we are...the lesser of our soul is remaining..our body is damaged by this winderful wealthy chain..including Perdue..Monsanto....etc
B00BESCJII|5.0|This was a great movie to watch with our teenage daughter!!  Absolutely loved it have told all our friends to watch it as well!  Should have been recognized for an Oscar nom!
B007SGM084|5.0|It took me awhile before I would buy this book. I heard about rape and such. For those that have never read a romance/erotic novel before you will have some shock. Those of us that don't shock start to look at the real meaning behind these characters and of course the great sex...is great sext.<br /><br />I must admit I became a bit irritated by her not calling her vulva what it was....I mean s*** they are using butt plugs..why be shy about sex words?<br /><br />If I had to write a similar book I would do a lot of copy pasting the sex scenes. It would get boring...hence why I cannot write them. EL does a FANTASTIC job into never making you feel that each time Christian spanks me or enters me that it is the same roll in the hay. She should make a book that lets us insert our name in for Anastasia... Wouldn't that be great?
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz returns to form after a few years of light jazz for the dinner jazz bar crowd.  This is essentially an r&b cd that Al Green would have been proud of.  The band is outstanding, the recording pristine and Boz's voice has mellowed somewhat but taken on more depth and resonance in the past.  Predominantly mid-tempo songs that never get tired.  This has been on my cd player for two weeks now and won't be coming off soon.  I've been a big Boz fan since Loan Me a Dime Days and this is a welcome audition to a much underappreciated artist.
B00BM1AJIO|2.0|Shorter than I expected for 4.99.  Ok graphics but pretty simple puzzles and anticlimactic ending.  The bonus chapter had glitches and I wasn't even able to finish it.  All in all disappointing.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|If you like thrillers you will enjoy this book. It was one of the better ones I have read this year.
B005LAII1C|5.0|He was so excited to know that I orderd this for him! he has watched several times already lol. great movie to add to our collection of DVD/Blueray :)
B0053O89WY|5.0|Order so my husband has something to watch when he's in areas that have no TV reception, he likes Big Bang Theory so plan to get all the seasons
B008JF8O9M|5.0|needed an app to be able to print from my Kindle Fire.  Just what I needed!  Prints every time with no problems.
0793563836|3.0|The book is fantastic but the cd's were warped. I had to keep them under a large book to get them to work. I was not happy with the CD's.  Once they did work, they are a bit hard to follow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't have time to get addicted to this! Lots of fun, challenge to play, great graphics, and free. How can you go wrong.
B003VIWO9I|4.0|Being a teenaged witch isn't easy.  There's the witching, there's the teen aging there's gender politics and the politics of work.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Upon its 1970 theatrical release, this film was met with indifference  and, considering its production expense, was a major box office disappointment. Perhaps in large part because of two factors, the still ongoing Viet Nam war, rendering a war weary public reluctant to embrace a big budget war film, coupled with the release of another yet slightly different war epic with star power and a more centrally driven character line. Patton, ironically released from 20th Century Fox as was Tora! Tora! Tora!, dominated 1970's box receipts as well winning the Academy Award for best picture as well as best actor for George C. Scott. Not the best marketing ploy for Fox at the time.<br /><br />In retrospect Tora! has become able to better stand on its alone for its accuracy and attention to details previously unknown to the general public surrounding the details leading up to the attack upon Pearl Harbor. The intelligence gathered from fragments of information gathered from G2 and Naval Intelligence and the two officers assigned to the task was facinating and brilliant considering what little concrete information with which they had work with along with a heavily ticking clock builds suspense, no easy task when the audience already knows the eventual outcome.<br /><br />Martin Balsam and Jason Robards overshadow who emerge as the real stars of this film. I refer to E. G. Marshall and Wesley Addy as Colonel Bratton and Lt. Cmdr. Kramer respectively as the two officers who solve the puzzle and frustratingly try to convince the American military leaders as to what was about to happen and encourage them to take action in the field. The other star is the film's special effects of the attack created in a time of no CGGs or other computer generated images. All were physically created by stunt men and stunning pyrotechnics which we may see the like ever again. The images captured on this film are eye opening for their spectacle and dangerous destruction, for most had to be shot in one take.<br /><br />Lastly, and importantly, the film is told from both the American and the Japanese perspectives adding increased credibility to the events depicted. As the details emerge from both sides as they head on a collision course adds to the suspense as to what comes next on the road to \\"a date that will live in infamy.\\" If one only knows that date and the result, the details revealed leading up to that result can be fascinating as well eye opening as to how the actual events unfolded and the time in which all took place.<br /><br />An exciting and informative history lesson, and you don't need to be a history buff to appeciate it.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The biggest criticisms I have are: it peters out in freshness as it goes on, you really get tired of Katniss's emotional constipation after a while, not as infuriatingly self conscious and insecure as that other girl in the Twighlight series, but it gets grating; there's a measure of repetition which in all fairness is likely due to recapping or reiterating so that each book can be somewhat self contained.  There are other post apocalyptic dystopian future tales and some done better, but this is not horrible, it keeps you reading, though you read more feverishly in the first two books.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Very super duper movie.<br />my 4 and a half girl was scare of the bad guy,, of course the boogie man, but afer explaining is her favorite movie of the year.
B004XISI4A|3.0|I began to get a little weary by book four.  But the twists and cliff hangers in this revived me!
B007FH9GA6|4.0|a bit slow but very intriguing movie that would have you to the edge of your  seat, with a great twist
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Ok, the entire series is involved.  At some points I wanted to skim through bits because some plot points and or twists seemed to get repetitive, bit no, had to go back and read with a fine toothed comb later.  Characters galore to immerse yourself in, real enough to make you really pissed off at some of them like your real family.  I'm so rooting for Arya
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Interesting and fast moving with good writing.  I have read 4 of his books lately and I plan to read many more.
B0064QNS62|5.0|You get to mine. It's like Mario .I love it!!!!!!!woot woot!!supper bopper!!:) you should get it !!have fun and get it now!!!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|This is definitely a great collection of hits worth the price and enjoyable to listen to!<br />If you like Phil Collins, don't miss out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts easy and quicky becomes more challenging.  This is a fun logic and perceptual game.  If you like logic games this is for you.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This was the best book out of the series.  It read at a faster pace than the first two.  I enjoyed the two sides of the story with Hanna and Lena.  Still feel like there is more to the story the way the book ended.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I loved this book so much i read it in two days. Written like a good novel but filled with fact. Chris takes you on a personel journey of how he discovered after years of running injuries, how to run. This journey took him into the drug cartel canyons of Mexico to meet, learn and ultimatley race with the legendary Tarahumara indians. Every runner and would be runner will love this book as well as non runners, its such a page turner!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It took so many twists and turns that I felt like I was on a roller coaster but didn't want it to end. The ending was a little weak and disappointing but it made sense after discussing it with others.
B0041D843M|5.0|The book is so well documented and well written that it will give the most ardent skeptic pause. Dr. Campbell's research is compelling and will likely transform the lives of many readers.
B00846REIS|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book. Very similar to Fifty Shades (which I don't think was writtten well). Very repetitive and predictable.
0192833383|1.0|did not like the author's style...very slow to start, a bit confusing, boring details that jump all over the place (but it could be my taste) it may work well for someone else.
1465001107|5.0|I love the large colorful photos of Michael. This is something I will treasure for a lifetime. I would recommend this calendar and any others of Michael to EVERYONE that loves Michael as much I do :)
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I did not know what to expect--I am usually disappointed with comedies. But this is a sophisticated comedy with many touching moments.  I enjoyed it tremedously.  I watched it a second time, very unusual for me.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I just love watching Michael perform. Watching this video puts me right there without being there. This video is definitely a must have for any true MJ fan. I'm glad I own it, I can watch it over and over again. The king :)
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like how this game gets better and better. Also it has better graphics then most games I play. Love the idea of the outside so that its easier to kill monsters and get to the castles and places.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What an enchanting tale! From begging to end I was mesmerized. I only wish the story and the circus could keep on going. If only there were such a place.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|my daughter wanted this SOOO bad so that she can listen to her music while in the shower since it claims to be safe to go UNDERWATER. She did not even submerge or anything. Got it a little wet and DAMAGED HER BRAND NEW IPHONE!!!! Its a knockoff or something!! So disgusted and disappointed!! BEWARE!!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I have the Kindle Fire HD and it would not work . Not Pleased at all. It wouldn't  load .disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like Mahjong, and this is a great way to play on Kindle.  There are many different tile set-ups, although the characters on the tiles are small.  It's a bit challenging, but I've enjoyed playing this game.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I think losing a showrunner every season is starting to show.  Towards the end especially, there are still very cool horror moments, but there are also moments that just don't sit write and that goes from some of the acting, writing, and even some of the clearly robotic zombies.  Still a good show, just didn't quite impress.
B008NMT684|5.0|This is a wonderful puzzle game for little ones!  My two-year-old grandson loves it!  Th pieces are easy to move into place and the artwork is colorful and fun!  Great little game!
B000000OU0|3.0|I may have missed reading about this, but I did not know when I bought the CD that it did not contain all of the great songs that are on the DVD.  I'm assuming that doing so would have required a second CD, but so what? I'm very disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game for passing some time.  Lots of different choices of set up and easy to use.  Fun for all ages.
B005PK56TA|4.0|The whole premise of this show caught me off guard.<br />Gives a different perspective to haunted houses.<br />And....the maid is hot!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'll admit I joined Facebook kicking and screaming, but my 20+ daughters insisted I'd like it.  I do!  I've been able to re-connect with friends from the past, as well as keep my family up to date.  My 80+ parents who live out of state also enjoy being able to see videos and photos of their great-grandchildren.  All-in-all a terrific website!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Traveling to Berlin..just had to re-read it! Great old spy tale takes place on the hotbed of spydom...East Berlin.  Great tale of spies, love, and mystery...
B003AKEGRK|4.0|This film takes revenge to a whole new level. It has one of the best surprise endings I've seen in years.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000274THQ|5.0|I had just returned from a two week intensive German language adventure when I ordered this German language DVD. I loved the Berlin footage and the fabulous storyline. This is an interesting tale if how one young East Berliner takes it upon himself to spare his devoutly devoted DDR mother from the stress of realizing that the world as she knew it has changed since falling into and awakening from a coma as the Wall came down in November 1989. Well worth watching once...interesting enough to watch again for the German language review.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Well done presentation of a story that is stranger than fiction.....WOW!!!  It is really an amazing story that will warm the heart as well as boggle the mind!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is not a review of the book. Which I read and liked. However, I can't get on Kindle anymore to re-read this book because of some \\"Nessissary Update\\" This is not fair. I won't be buying from Kindle again.
B0040HO01Y|2.0|This series follows the tradition of off-setting the less appealing consequences of the modernization of rural towns and villages with copious drafts of traditional &#34;wisdom&#34; and &#34;old-fashioned common sense.&#34; And there is no villager more &#34;saintly&#34; in imparting both the latter than the yeoman played by Brendan Coyle. Unfortunately the tensions created by modernity are all too familiar to most viewers hence the series struggles to maintain sufficient tension for us to care about the outcomes.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Picture was grainy. Sound was quite. Not surround sound in this DVD. Had to put on the subtitles. Don't know if I just got a bad copy, but the was a poor transition to DVD, in my opinon
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Now that I'm over 40 this is really funny to relate to. I definitely recommend watching it. Puts things into perspective
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We loved the vibrant colors in this movie. Granny was funny also. Great humor. I will add this to our home collection
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is an excellent book which reveals Stephen King's own struggles with how he views God and views life..  I think that in writing this book, King worked out his own emotional pain from Kennedy's assassination and the general disintegration of our culture since then.  I think he realizes by the end of the book that he could not do better than God has in managing the flow of history, and that people are responsible for the evil in this world.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie reminds me of my high school days. Nothing like a Great movie to take you back! I love it!
B00000JXHB|5.0|Got this for my husband. He loves The Outlaws! He has played it non stop with a huge southern smile. Very good buy it!
B001DHXT20|4.0|This movie is great to go with my collection of movies that go with the Avengers. Gotta collect them all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was a really good game but it took forever to load but maybe it's just the internet because it's been really slow EVER since my daughter downloaded a game called slender so ITS REALLY GOOD GET IT
B004NOH9LC|5.0|It is light and pretty. Loooove the boyfriend! Smoking indeed! The beginning is a bit like The Devils wears Prada, but the movie is better.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara have done it again! They continue to evolve their musical style, and as a fan of 8 years and counting, I like hearing fresh things from them!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Another Dr. Seuss movie, it is typical Dr. Seuss, great for kids of all ages.  :) Enjoy movies at home.
B009S33I68|5.0|The care and love of Harold Moore for his men and the dedication of Joe Galloway is shown in the writing of this book. Truly a great group of men that overcame adversity, and adapted to the way things were done during that time.  Having seen the movie beforehand, the closeness in how they were told is good.  Recommend this book to anyone wanting to know how soldiers bonded and stood by and for each other during troubling times.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Very well done. Treats the story with respect and intensity. Would be great to have more about Tora Bora. Great acting.
0679805273|5.0|Such a wonderful book! I would recommend this product to anyone of any age. Got this as a graduation gift for a friend :)
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire, and it took awhile to learn the game controls.  But after a bit of time (and practice) it became easier and now I find the game an enjoyable way to pass the time while sitting in the airport waiting for my flight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game gives you everything you want, it's for boys and girls and very enjoyable. I must say it is addictive but things are only addictive if there fun and boy it is so fun!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good writing, but so similar to the first book as to almost be a part of that instead of a second book
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this helps me a lot with my math and I could. do my multiply. and study for my at school .
B00B23O96A|3.0|I don't care much for old socks.  A couple songs are remarkably not bad, and some are interesting stabs at old timey standards... all oddly mixed in with &#34;EC was here&#34;-era reggae.  Seems like a few experiments gathered up off the cutting floor and sold to fulfill a contractual obligation.  Suppose he's earned the right to do, though...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use and has everything you need. Easy to read on my kindle and is full screen.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Google is a necessary item on my Kindle, though I still have difficulty trying to get to my mail.  In time, I will learn the right combinations of words that Google wants.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I didn't understand what I could use it for once I loaded it. I thought I could use it for word or excel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is nice to be able to have a game on my Kindle for times of short waits.at bus stop or at doctor's office.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I very much enjoyed it, the story was very interesting. I would definitely recommend this book as a must read,
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Saw other productions of this story which were much better. I thought that the attempt to modernize it ruined the story. I disliked it that much that I did not watch the whole thing. Would not recommend.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I very much enjoyed it, the story was very interesting. I would definitely recommend this book as a must read,
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have waited with bated breath for my favorite broadway show to become a movie.  It was done very well with only a few difficulties. Anne Hathaway was fabulous in acting and singing. Hugh Jackman who played Val Jean did an adequate job singing but I felt that he did not have the pipes for some of the songs (especially &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;).  For some reason, he chose to &#34;talk/sing&#34; in some areas. Russell Crowe who played Javair (sic) did a much better job. (who knew he could sing?) Marius who was played by Eddie Redmayne was very good and the rest of the cast was memorable. I was disappointed w/ Sasha Baron Cohen's and Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of the Thedinaires (sic). On broadway, it was much funnier. Interesting side note: the role of Jean Val Jean and music he sang was written for Colm Wilkinson who was the first one on Broadway in London. In the movie, he portrayed the Bishop. This movie is well worth your time and is suitable for family viewing (might be too intense for wee ones). If you have never seen a broadway show, this is a good introduction.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Good intentions gone astray.  In the beginning Facebook was fun and useful in keeping In touch with family and friends .<br /><br />They have attempted to add more questions to enroll, that takes too long  that people get bored..
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Everyone here plays from my 2 year old niece to my 75 year old mom dad. We love it.  It's great
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Phenomenal picture and sound! Fantastic extras. This can be watched over and over. Debbie Reynolds could not have been cuter. Ad the talents of Gene Kelly and Donald 'O Conner, the hilarious performance of Jean Hagan and you have a timeless film. Great for all ages.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|This sounded like a really good movie, but it turned out to be something really bizarre, was not a fan
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was the standard 007 movie of impossible feats, flawless female characters, and huge fiery destruction.  Long, loud, and Bond.
B000I9W08I|5.0|How bad could it be - its Barbara!  Costuming, dancing, singing - superb.  Will purchase as gift at the next opportunity.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was great and Denzel Washington was his usual phenomenal self.  Sends a powerful message about accepting responsibility in your life and how addiction can ruin an entire family.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had really been looking forward toward reading this book.  I read lots of great reviews.  I found it quite slow and I didn't connect to the characters .  Once the conclusion became obvious,I was even more disappointed in the writing
B004N0I3U2|4.0|Pretty good movie, always exciting to watch a 007 movie.  Have watched them for years and always fun and thrilling to watch.
B000000U5L|5.0|Could possibly be the greatest soundtrack of all time. Absolute treasure! I crank this record every time I hit the gym
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I read 5 books in the series, only to discover that there is no ending. More books are planned, but no one knows when.
B000KIE11Q|4.0|The watch is very nice and it works just fine. The only critic is about the maintenance: if you break something it´s dificult to have it fixed.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great combination of Feel Good and Drama. My wife and I are watching two episodes a night to try and catch up to live.  Would definitely recommend!
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|Generally don't play these games but the reviews were good and it was free. Tried it , had my 13 year old Grandson try it..bottom line we deleted it.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I've never written a review before, but wanted to take the time to thank The History Channel for making this masterpiece!!! I encourage you to watch if you haven't already. This is a show I'll watch over and over! And for once, there's no damsel in distress, the main female character kicks butt and takes names :)
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It just seemed like this season drug on a little bit. They would take an entire episode to tell a story they could've or would've previously told in half an episode. I felt like they were sort of running out of material for withholding material for the next season.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|GOT continues to move right along. It's nice to know George R.R. won't ever have to write anything again for the rest of his life. I understand he has a cameo in Season 3. Looking forward to Season 3, probably a year away for me. Waiting....
B003XVYLDU|5.0|There are enough reviews out there that will describe the plot and attempt to explain the subject matter, so you can read them if you want that information.  The thing I like about this book is that it's hard to answer the question, &#34;What is it about?&#34; as in, &#34;What is its purpose?&#34; or &#34;What does this story have to do with me and my life?&#34;.<br /><br />The story's subject matter and the plot structure are based on a &#34;What if...&#34; question:  what if the past, present and future moments in your lifetime were all happening at the same time, and therefore, your past deeds have not shaped your present condition - and what you do today will have no effect on your future because it has already happened and always will.  What if you knew exactly when, where and how you were going to die but it didn't matter because at the same time you are dying you are being born, or getting married or fighting in a war, or starting a business?  The story's protagonist is able to experience different moments in his lifetime in real time and learns to accept that those moments have happened, are happening and will always happen.<br /><br />Yes, it's easy to interpret Slaughterhouse Five as an example of Vonnegut's supposedly bleak view of humanity and the pointlessness of everything we do, but that would make reading this story a complete waste of time.  It probably took a lot of time and effort for Mr Vonnegut to write this story; I can't imagine he wrote it so we could all exclaim, &#34;So what?&#34;.  Yes, Kurt Vonnegut has a touch of Jonathan Swift in him in that he dislikes our tendency to overestimate our power and abilities.  Vonnegut doesn't hate us and neither does Swift - they both attempt to take us down a peg or two and remind us that we are not gods.  We don't really know as much as we think we do and we're not as powerful and clever as we think we are.  It's easy to disparage a writer who refuses to stroke your ego but instead tells you the truth.It's not hatred - it's tough love.<br /><br />So, what is Slaughterhouse Five about?  I think it has something to do with learning acceptance.  Learning to accept ourselves the way we are without blaming anybody, including ourselves.  Learning to accept life without judging, evaluating, or trying to change it.  The answer is another &#34;what if...&#34; question:  What if we just got on with it, instead of trying to control everything?<br />What if we just lived?
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey and was new to the series when it started earlier this year so I went back and watched the past seasons. After this, I wanted to re-watch this episode to tie everything together. The program and episode were fantastic, no issues there. My only issue, and it was a big one, is the item I viewed from Amazon was not high definition and was a poor quality. This was a bit of a let down. Not sure if I somehow missed the HD version of if it just wasn't available.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A story that grips at your heart, in more ways than one.  Easy quick read.  I couldn't put it down & finished it in 3 days.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the most fun! If you have yet to join the Downton circle NOW IS THE TIME. This is the most wonderful series. I adrore all the diverse characters and the dramatic twists and turns. I am always excited to be in the abbey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it so addicting!can't stop playing...time just flies when I play.you have to download this game! Your kids will love it too!
B009EDYZBY|5.0|My kids love this movie!!! They watch it on their kindle fire HD all the time. Kid friendly and great picture. Very entertaining!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better  than the first book.  Could not put it down.  I wonder what more can they possibly do to this group of people...  Thank you so much for an exciting journey........
1401230067|3.0|These books are very boring and the stories make little sense. I would recommend if you have to have this wait for the new 52's by DC comics
B005HSL626|4.0|This rating is from my 11 year old grandson (he selected the game).  He says he liked it.  You have to be fast to make points.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great story and characters, the writing skills are not impressive, but a truly beautiful story. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it.  The running and action are a game an 11 year old gets into and continues to play. He has not beat it yet.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|5 discs! If you're a Pumpkins fan or just love the album, you won't be disappointed in this. There are some great b-sides and unreleased tracks.
B00116FT6M|5.0|Our family watched this and loved it!  It's a great story and just a lot of fun!  Our kids who don't usually like musicals, loved this one.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I love John Goodman and Tommy Lee Jones.  It was a good movie.<br />I had never seen this one before so that was a bonus.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Real life event was perfectly made in a movie; watching it you can feel intensely what was going on in his live.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 captures the essence of the original storyline while deftly weaving in Merle, Daryl and other significant modifications to the story that work just as well-if not better than--the original storyline (much of which, in my opinion, could not reasonably be shown on television and would most likely drive away new viewers).
B0082RHRHC|5.0|My favorite book of all time!  Exquisite writing. Beautiful language. Brilliant characters. Every word is a treasure. I read it every year
0385349947|5.0|Beautifully written! Am so happy I bought it, and it is my firm book from amazon. I will keep it for my unborn daughters.
630514415X|5.0|This was a great movie.  One of Spike Lee's best and one of Denzel's great movies.  Great acting and performance.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of the old.Mario bros games. Alot of fun- can't believe its free! Just started playing and already I can't put it down.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another great book in the series. I will be sorry when it ends. The characters always find something more to keep you turning the pages and hoping for. Just when I thought I found a favorite, a new twist comes along and I find myself struggling with a new choice. Your blood runs from hot to cold, Just like Fire and Ice!
0765356139|5.0|[...]    When I read Brandon Sanderson's \\"The Final Empire\\" a couple months ago, I was instantly hooked. I mean, a great cast of characters, an eerily omnipotent bad guy, super cool powers and a thrilling plot...what more could you ask for? (You can read me rave more about the book here.) I always like having some breathing space between books in a series, just to mull over what happened and build up some anticipation, and a few days ago, I decided that now was the time to embark on another journey with Vin and her friends in \\"The Well of Ascension\\", the second installment in the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\".    A year has passed since Vin defeated the Lord Ruler, a year since Kelsier, the mastermind behind the elaborate plan to take down the all-powerful God incarnate of the Central Dominance, died and became a martyr. But the defeat of the tyrant left behind enormous instabilities in the realm. As Kelsier's protege and the slayer of the Lord Ruler, Vin is venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her increasingly uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists that she found comfort in are acting strangely, and seems to harbour a mysterious entity that haunts her. With three armies now vying to conquer Luthadel, Kelsier's crew knows that the noose is tightening. The only thing offering a glimmer of hope is an ancient prophecy of the Hero of Ages and the Well of Ascension, and Vin plans on finding it to save the city she sought to free.    One of the things I love the most about the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\" is its wonderful cast of characters. Every single one of them, from Vin to Elend to Straff, has his or her own distinct personalities, stories and thoughts, and the character building that Mr. Sanderson has done throughout the first two books, and even the second book alone, is astounding. Despite their differences, the characters in \\"The Well of Ascension\\" work perfectly with each other, both complementing and foiling others in a way that adds to the dynamismand complexities of the book as a whole. Take, for example, Vin and Elend. We all knew from the start that they would end up together as a couple--anyone with two brain cells to rub could see that! But what's really interesting to see unfold is how the two worked together in a time of crisis, and how both of them struggled with the relationship because they felt like they were too different from another to truly understand the other person. Admittedly, I felt like this whole question of self-worth and self-identity was a little too drawn-out throughout the book, but I think it perfectly shows the ways in which two characters, though seemingly contrasting one another, actually meld to create complex, human relationships in the story.    I usually find that the plot of sequels are hardly ever as exciting as that of the first book, but this was most certainly not the case in \\"The Well of Ascension\\"! Mr. Sanderson did an excellent job of creating an entirely new storyline from the previous one in a way that linked the two together, but presented a brand new set of obstacles and perspectives to the trilogy. There was hardly ever a dull moment throughout--the plot was, without a doubt, compelling and engaging, even in moments that weren't describing an action-packed scene of some sort. And the ending! The last part of the book had my heart racing, and let me just say, Mr. Sanderson, you are one tricky trickster! The twist at the end just had my eyes bulging out of their sockets. Wow. It'll definitely be interesting to see how everything turns out.    All in all, \\"The Well of Ascension\\" is an exciting sequel to \\"The Final Empire\\", full of what made the first book so compelling: a great cast of characters, realistic character development, an eerily magical world and a thrilling storyline. I will definitely be reading the final book of the trilogy, \\"The Hero of Ages\\", to see how everything unfolds! After some breathing space, that is.    Rating: 5/5
B0058VW36U|5.0|A good level of challenge..and fun but hard at times so.I have to think and strategize. Fun..exciting hard but not too!
B00AA0U046|5.0|Sounds like a perfect Hendrix record to me I love the 2 LPS they work just fine, and the sound is Amazing I love the album cover it looks just awesome. Thank you Hendrix for recording this great music
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The standard quality offered by Amazon is very poor, as compared to Netflix. The stream was good however, and i will likely oder more movies in higher definition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes, the ads are annoying, but the app itself is superb. I plan to buy the full version to get rid of the ads and enjoy the game and fully.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm really happy with the way this book ended. It was very fitting, although very sad. And the epilogue isn't as horrible as most would imagine. It's just simple enough to suite most anyone's needs. :)
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Best CD I've heard in a long time. All the songs are good, I listen to entire CD not just 1 or 2 songs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Five stars indeed. What a fascinating look at what makes us human, what it means to win or survive in the world we live in. What Hunger Games are we playing?
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I can't play this game at all. I purchased it for my Kindle Fire for my grandchildren to play and I am unable to even download it. I'm not sure if I missed something in the explanation about it not being compatible with the Kindle operating system.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a repeat of the first one as well as a running game so don't expect much originality. However I enjoyed playing it and running through the mines and obstacles. The giant monkey was fun to run from. I would recommend it to anyone and assure users that the game though encouraging you to buy coins is completely free. If you have patience and good hand-eye corrination you can get coins without needless spending. Download it yourself and see if you like it. Otherwise have fun.
B008M34INW|4.0|Considering everyone is out to get The Main Character in this adult fairy tale, the ending is appropriately biblical. Living by the Sword and all that for, seemingly, the entire criminal world excluding the main characters. As one of my friends would say, &#34;Blood and gore all over the floor, and me without my spoon&#34;.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|good game to play. highly addictive. play against friends on facebook. the sound is off on the kindle but works well on my phone.
1479253022|4.0|The large print is so easy to read, even for me who usually has to read with a magnifying glass. Every speck of space is used on the page, so the layout is not pleasing as in a normal book, but for those of us who love to read but have trouble seeing, this is not important. One thing that is unfortunate is that there are no page numbers. Still, it's worth giving them up to gain maximum size of print. I am so grateful that this publisher makes these books available to us. I will be buying books through them whenever they publish a book that I am looking for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Young girls who will read this will get the wrong idea on so many levels. People seem to love the shock value. Come on when will you find a young, handsome man with a smoking body who also happens to be a billionaire. Yea right.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series. It sucked me in and took me on a wild ride. I loved every minute of it.<br />Pick up this series for the time of your life.<br />Suzanne Collins doesn't write just for teens. She describes the emotional torment of these kids as they suffer at the hands of the Capital.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great show it is better than I expected. Very addicting though. I wasn't too into the first season but this one I couldn't get enough of
B009KEN87O|5.0|Have a lot of fun playing this game when killing time.  Its like playing a throwback Atari game.  Recommended for everyone.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|As usual Colleen Hoover's writing is excellent. You have to love a book that can make you shed a tear for the characters. Opened my eyes to slam poetry which, by the way is freaking cool!!! This is a must read!!!
B0037B6QSY|5.0|A classic, this book is like a guidebook to being in the moment and finding happiness at a higher level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing amazing Amazing but not ok some time when you try to swip up it swipes down its so annoying then but it's cool my last subway serf was better because it didn't work out like this one does. The first of all the new age of all the new age of all time favorite is dead at the new version of this year and my name is dead.lol I think that's boring and my fingers crossed the hole time when you try to stop it. It star in a few weeks of the hole and a half hour and ny lot of this is a big prank the new version from your site and a half hour and a bit like this year old son of all the new age of all the new version of this is dead. . . .
B00884GR0W|4.0|Can someone tell me what is wrong with the app? It was working TOTALLY well but then It would not<br />Let me get on!!!!! It sais creating new world so I wait there for like an hour and nothing happens at all. IT SAIS CREATING NEW WORLD AND I DON'T GET A NEW WORLD!!!! Is this happening to you guys too?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son originally however I have begun to enjoy playing it myself. It's a great game people who love horses.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the 2nd season. I gave the 1st season 5 stars. The 2nd season seemed to be bogged down and dragging out. Just seemed not to be going anywhere. However, looking forward to the 3rd season. Still, I recommend it. It's just a step down after the first season.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Really enjoyed this first season. Watched it all in a few days. Make sure you watch the special features. Really sets up the story well. Think they did a great job of character development. Just don't too fond of your favorite character(s). Many shades of gray. The good characters have some bad in them as the darker characters have some good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire. When I saw this app I had to get it. The only thing that I don't like is that an add will come up after you pick your deal
1400069807|5.0|Riveting throughout, great reporting and well documented.  I thought I knew, but I grew up in the 50-60's, and Big Food had hardly even begun.  Great reporting in that the author who built close relationships with executives and former executives and scientists.  When Phillip Morris took over Kraft, Kraft learned a lot about PR under adverse circumstances and the industry matured in the sense of losing what innocence it had. Once read, you will never see processed food the same way again, and no doubt your body will thank you. Whether as history or as food advice, the book had many facets and I consider it one of the best of they year.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|This is a great looking wireless controller for the PS3. But I have had considerable problems with lag and dead zones with the joystick. Those things make this controller almost unusable for playing. Maybe I got a bad unit. But with the problems I've experienced, I can't recommend this controller. I'll stick to Sony controllers.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is kind of fun but seems to take awhile to be able to get the coins to work. I do like that you can shake the table.  LOL
B000A0K2JO|5.0|Needed this to adapt USB keyboard to PS/2.  Works well and better price than I could find elsewhere for an adapter that was reported to work.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much .  I will say watching it on the kindle fire was great.  A little dark in spots.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|In fairness, if you have never seen the Broadway version then this review will fall on deaf ears, since you won't have anything<br />to compare this movie to, and in that regard, it's fine.<br /><br />However, even giving Russell Crowe a pass since he doesn't make his living singing, there are some performances here that<br />are so bad compared to the stage version that it's almost remarkable these folks were cast.<br /><br />But since I don't feel like getting in an on-line discussion with people that just love this film, I will simply say this:<br /><br />Sasha Baron Cohen is simply terrible. Even if he can't sing (and boy, he can't) the role of Thenardier is about having fun and<br />being completely over-the-top - something you would expect he would be able to do. This is a dark story as it is and this character<br />is there to bring some levity. SBC fails at this so badly it's almost hard to watch.<br /><br />If you have seen the musical live LOWER your expectations for this film.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Honestly this book was just super fun to read. Looking forward to see how the movie turns out. High recommend.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very fast read.  It made many long airline flights go by quickly.  Being raised in LA it also was an interesting recap of a time I lived through but had forgotten.
0345522478|5.0|Love this saga/chronicle. Book as sent in good time and received undamaged. Wonderful reading -- collect the all and enjoy!
B00B23O96A|4.0|I gave 4 stars because it is a slow less deliberate album, but.....it is Eric.  A few oldies well worth listening to the guitar..
B005ZUR724|1.0|this app wont even install on my kindle fire! it says its having trouble downloading don't buy it until its fixed waste of money! ); GAMELOFT please fix!! I like this game I just want to play it on a bigger screen bu I cant now!
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Having listened to Boz for many years, the youthful perfections in his voice can still be heard throughout the songs.  I liked the traditional covers he performed.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I have heard of Mastodon just a year ago! Lucky me, I get to jump around their albums and first time listen to them little by little. I have bought Leviathan before and so Crack the Skye is my new favorite. I cant wait for more!!
B008XBASVY|5.0|Chris Colfer keeps proving that he is a force to be reckoned with. This book was perfect. It has everything you're looking for in a good book. Highly recommended!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire HD with no issues. Storyline was good and the entire game was just hard enough to get u a little frustrated but not enough to prevent u from continuing. Well worth the price.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a new album this much in a long time. Corina Corina is worth the price alone. I've heard this song by many an artist but this one brings emotion not just beat. Find a quiet time and relax and enjoy this smooooth collection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|just started this game but it seems easy to understand and play and follow ... enjoying it very much so far.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|The classic stories help pass the time when I am without my ereader or another book while waiting on appointments or in line.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game! I could spend hours on it a day. I love their little \\"around the world\\" things they do. So far, I've been to Rio and Sydney!

B00B2G2RG6|1.0|The show managed to be apolitical for the first half dozen installments, but two militia psychos were introduced and the only explanation we get for their murderous and evil vocation is &#34;we are Constitutionalists&#34;. Oh I feel so shunned and associated with psycho-murderers because I know what is in the Constitution and that most of modern government violates it. If you are not going to discuss something seriously then don't bring it up. Just using your show for some not-so-clever name calling is not impressive it is pathetic and indicates an intellectual and honesty deficit.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Decent cover/case for the Fire HD 7.5.  not sure if I would get this particular one again.  Not as skinny as the IPad cases.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is nothing boring about flesh eating zombies when they are created in such a way as to draw you into the reality of their nightmare universe. There are a lot of zombie movies. So far each one of these installments is as good as the best of these movies. There is no problem creating dramatic tension when, in any scene and at any time in any scene, flesh eating zombies can crash the party, but making us buy into the zombies in the first instance is brilliantly done and a dorky zombie portrayal can break the spell - hasn't happened yet.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Good music. Nice to hear a good bluesy music.  Boz is always laid back and well positioned in his music.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Been running this app for a while now and have come to depend on it to keep me appraised of the battery status.  I use my phone heavily at times and keeping track of the battery status is a major requirement.  Thanks to the developers for a great app.
B000KOZMUE|5.0|I waited a long while before purchasing a speed flash to use with my D70.<br />simple to use, without adding a lot of weight<br />I'd buy it again
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Very good acting and attention to detail as far as making it authentic to the period, 1920's-30's.  Not a big fan a violence and I wonder if they added some for drama.  Would have been just as good using more of my imagination than actually seeing torture, etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is just like having a real horse. It lets you make the food groom it and even enter it in competitions! A very fun game for kids and adults. Get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very much the same idea as Temple Run except we're running along a set of subway tracks, being chased by...something! and facing oncoming trains, runaway containers, buffers to roll under, and other obstacles to jump over. Collect the coins and boosts as you go, and dodge from side to side to change tracks as you're running to avoid being struck by the trains.
B000003BF1|5.0|This is one of their best albums.Its a classic.My favorite song is the most famous one Give me Shelter.The rest is also great.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is a great, user friendly app that I have on my Kindlefire, my iPod touch and on my PC. I can set tasks up that sync to all three devices and set up reminds that get emailed to me as well. I can't emphasize enough how user friendly this is!
B0000073BG|4.0|I would recommend this compact disc to people who like seventies progressive music.They are not as popular as E.L.P,but they are as good if not better.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Although I'm a senior citizen, my husband and I love this series and will sometimes take a &#34;Supernatural&#34; day and watch them all day long!  We have all the series to date and can skip the ones we've seen lots of times prior, so getting them this way is perfect!<br />Love it!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I bought the 3D combo package not for the 3D (I don't have any 3D equipment) but because of the added extras.  It's a lot of fun to go back to scenes that were stunning and actually see &#34;all&#34; of the details (right...maybe &#34;more of the details?).  I'll probably wind up with separate copies of the Hobbit movies the way I did with LOTR, and then get an even more extras-packed box set later.  Until then, I'm enjoying watching the Goblin King, the Rock Giants, and of course all the dwarves...  Great package, great value, great film.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its a great game.but it always has pop up adds. it gets on your last nerves sometimes. you'd like it
034544678X|5.0|Dogs react to people based on the way the people behave around the dogs.  That sounds simple, but how the dog reacts is a lot more complex than it might appear.  This is a wonderful read and extremely illuminating.  You and your dog will be a lot more on the same page once you read this book.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I admit to being disappointed.  I am disappointed because the sequel has not yet been finished and I find myself desperately wanting to find out what happens next.  This book is excellent and entertaining from start to finish.  Most large books have various slow points that you just have to \\"power through\\" to get to the exciting parts.  For this reason I sometimes find myself putting books like that down for a while before I can get back into it.  I did not have that problem while reading this; each chapter is exciting and the characters are well developed and interesting.  Do yourself a favor and get this book now and find yourself disappointed for the same reason I am...where's the next book!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This has been a well acted drama with a lot of interesting characters involved in political and personal conflicts. Julianna Margulies is a very strong leading character in the role of an attorney who is a very smart woman as well as a very attractive one. Her family life and her personal life intertwine in the role in ways that are creative and intriguing.
0810993139|4.0|When I first started looking into this book to read there were a range of opinions from people who loved it - usually kids- to people who hated and could barely tolerate it - mostly adults and parent.  Personally I found Greg likeable, in the sense I don't have anything to do with him and thus can appreciate his antics without having to deal without the inevitable consequence.  Sure he is a bit snarky, self-centered and impulsive but he's also fun; basically he's a regular middle school boy.  Maybe it is my middle school sense of humor, but I tend to like smart asses and have a special place in my heart for the class clown and the pursuit of trying to fit in.<br /><br />I loved the journal format and stick drawings and the fact that it was a fun book about everyday life, which almost anyone can relate too.  I giggled my through this book and thoroughly made a fool of myself in front of people at the doctor's office, mechanics and basically anywhere I bothered to read it, and even my husband couldn't help but ask every five minutes what was so funny.  Unfortunately, I could never quite relate the genius of this book to others; I guess it's just something you have to read for yourself.<br /><br />Even if you can't like it as an adult, it's easy to understand why middle schoolers love it, do not deny them the pleasure of reading this book.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com

B007REV4YI|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite Bond movies.  I would say it is the best Bond of the current generation (Pierce to now).
B004ZNARH4|5.0|gosh, has it been 30 years? i caught their concert in nearly front row seats in a semi-open-air venue back then. totally awesome. yes, further renditions added lots of glitz, but its the music - the sound - the unbelievable energy. such a lucky soul was i.<br /><br />and yes, was at woodstock 1 as well. perks of being old is the time slot available to me when i was young.<br /><br />If you have the money it will be well spent buying this bit of glitter from the days of celestial fireworks.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love the game, it is very addictive. I can't wait for the sequel! Please keep them coming. Graphics good, story good, challenging.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very exciting and suspenseful.  Brought back a lot of memories from that tense time in American history.  The movie seemed to stay true to the events of day.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|It is the not-too-distant future, and mankind has finally gone beyond our own moon.<br /><br />The good news is, NASA is apparently making spacecraft again.  The bad news?  Astronauts seem to have the temperament and vernacular of high-school dropouts with mild Tourette's Syndrome... with the exception of the protagonist, who apparently had the additional education of a finishing school run by Charles M. Schultz in order to pick up colloquialisms like \\"Boo!\\", \\"Ugh!\\" and \\"Yay!\\"  The up-side to such unsuitable vocabulary is that it's the only way in which to distinguish the main character from the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Some reviews refer to this story as \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" on Mars.  It's neither like the Defoe classic, nor like the (excellent) 1964 film, `Robinson Crusoe on Mars'.  Basically, a man with two master's degrees stumbles his way from one overly-contrived adversity to the next without once resorting to anything remotely similar to professional competency.  The hero tells us that an object has fewer kilograms on Mars than on Earth, 36 volts constitutes `High Voltage', a single location can triangulate a radio signal, and Elton John's `Rocket Man' is disco... as well as a whole slew of surprisingly unintelligent references to his apparent degrees in engineering and botany  Also, despite the title, there is no \\"Martian\\" to be found (In the same way I would not be a Scotsman if a Carnival cruise liner stranded me in Aberdeen).<br /><br />Another annoying bit of style on behalf of the author is the constant penchant to tell the reader to \\"remember\\" an aspect of the narration, followed by a recap.  I'll demonstrate by closing this review in a similar fashion.  Remember:  kilogram is a unit of mass not weight, 36 volts is ten AA batteries in series, to `triangulate' you need three simultaneous bearings from distinct angles, `Rocket Man' isn't disco... and it's unlikely astronauts will ever speak like profane Peanuts characters.ne Peanuts characters.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|As the most influential band in the history of Pop and Rock music, this collection is a must for any music lover. There has been much discussion about the relative quality of these remastered recordings. Not being privy to the original recordings, if you can find them in &#34;mint&#34; condition (I do own a couple of original albums and singles but they've had a rough life) then this collection sounds absolutely awesome and all for about $300.<br /><br />These are 1960's and early 1970's recordings, whilst cutting edge technology was employed at the time of original recording, they are quite raw compared to modern recordings. To me, that's a huge part of their appeal. I prefer to listen to iconic albums like these with a minimum of fuss; a decent turntable, a quality pre-amplifier, a quality amplifier, and high quality speakers. Don't turn up the Bass, don't turn up the Treble, don't do anything fancy with the sound (like stadium, music hall, or 5.1 DTS); leave your sound system in stereo and neutral. Just turn up the volume. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000ZM7VVO|4.0|We like this band and we like this album.  It's cool, it's great, couldn't be happier with it.  = )
B0064MGU98|5.0|As told from the perspective of &#34;The Good Wife&#34;, provides one of the most realistic accounts of one person's life--with personal and professional lives overlapping and affecting the other--that I have seen in a very long time. Superb acting and logical (if not always likable) behaviors of the characters. People are not larger than life, but they ARE true to life.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I am not disappointed with my purchase, since it will be nice to be able to watch the three past seasons of this masterpiece at my leisure.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Outstanding. Not only did this book finally help me to understand why I always thought there was seriously wrong with me, but it was very well written and captivating. A message of hope, understanding and acceptance. Heartily recommended. Susan Cain did a great job with this work.
B001UJIMMS|3.0|I love this record but the sound quality is sub par. Would love to hear this one remastered.<br /><br />My son love's this band !
B001KZG99A|5.0|Everything Robert Downey Jr. is in is worth watching. It has a good plot with plenty of humor. Great movie. Iron man is my favorite of the Avengers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game you all out there should give this game 5 stars<br />So I hope you guys listen to me and give it 5 stars
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I resisted seeing this movie in the theaters only because the movie trailers and so-so reviews made it seem that it would not be worthwhile. NOW, I wish that I had followed my instincts and gone to see it in theaters. Regardless of where I saw it and when, it took me back to Middle Earth and reminded me of all the reasons why I dearly love the Lord of the Rings movies and the assortment of cast, characters, plots and sub-plots. It was so good to see some beloved characters being introduced -- or reintroduced -- in this prequel. The great news is that there are more Hobbit adventures coming, and I plan to be the first in line at the theaters when they are released. Thank you to Peter Jackson for another chance to visit Middle Earth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome for those who are in love with horses.y o u move up the levels just like you would with your own horse / horses.
0140067477|5.0|I have bought this book many times. I probably will many more times. It has the answer I was looking into religions for.<br />Brief interpretation of my own:  There are many hives around the world. Some hives have clover honey, some linden, or basswood, and many others. But it is all honey whichever we pick.<br /><br />I stiil like different types of honey. I still like researching different religions. But I learned from Pooh just to be outside is my house made by the queen bee.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw the movie and I know book my be a little different. I am still working on a comparsion between the two.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|The actors were obviously way out of date ... last MIB was a decade ago and age has caught up with both actors.  I'm glad I rented instead of buying.
0151003084|5.0|My grandmother had this book when I was growing up. We all fought over it when she was ready to pass it on. I didnt win so I ordered this one. Obviously, will never be as good as the original grandmother copy but it is great ot have. Yes it is a little dark, but it is good for a laugh and to learn the alphabet.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|To the men and women who made this movie: Thank you for telling us absolutely nothing useful about the so-called \\"War on Terror.\\" Everything covered in this movie was already told - and told better - by newspapers, the Internet and news TV/radio stations. What this movie did, however, is just copy and paste the same stories and presented them in a 2 ½ hour format, with very little background story or character development. By omitting background story and character development, this movie actually made it less believable to see and believe the movie. Not only that, but it also makes \\"Zero Dark\\" a very lazy way to a make a movie.<br /><br />So now that all this time, talent and money have been spent on telling us absolutely nothing, why don't they - the big Hollywood filmmakers - take time telling stories that matter?! If they want to tell stories about 9/11, why not start by asking questions. Questions such as: Who financed the attack? Who/which parties benefited from it? How was it possible to attack the most powerful nation on earth? What led the attackers to attack America? What was their reason for the attack? Did the fact that they were trained by the CIA to kill the Soviets - the infidels - and then allowed to keep their weapons and funding to attack the US have anything to do with 9/11? Why were the very drugs that funded terrorist operations allowed to grow and increase AFTER the US invaded Afghanistan? Why wasn't Bin Laden captured when the US had him surrounded in Afghanistan? Did Bin Laden even exist? Did he have help/support inside the US in the 9/11 attacks? Who were his connections and supporters? Are/Were any US politicians involved? What role did corporations play in the 9/11 attacks? Instead of invading the whole country of Iraq, why weren't the same tactics that got Bin Laden used to get Saddam Hussein? So on; so on, and so on...<br /><br />By contrast, \\"Argo\\" - another movie made last year about the \\"actual\\" events in the Mid-East - took time todo some research and tell a credible story. While some of the events may have changed in that movie, the movie itself was very entertaining and very well directed by Ben Affleck. \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" however, takes itself way too seriously, but at the end delivers none of the thrills or entertainment value it's expected to deliver.<br />Don't get me wrong here, though, I'm not suggesting that all movies should deliver entertainment and nothing more. What I'm suggesting is that if you are not presenting all the facts (as in Zero Dark's case), or are presenting them in a way that makes them seem stupid and unbelievable, then, at least, you should deliver some entertainment value, if nothing else.<br /><br />Having said that, I do understand that it's difficult to make an \\"entertaining\\" movie about such a difficult subject - terrorism - which any way one looks at it, presents the darkest moments in human history. Darkest moments because a group of men, either driven by religious extremism/revenge/money/whatever attacked and killed thousands of innocent people, and then another group of men - a much larger one - went after them and attacked, not caring that their attack too would end up destroying many innocent lives. It's also a very dark chapter because all the facts of both the 9/11 attacks and, of what led the attackers to attack, have been kept secret from the public.<br /><br />So if you loved this movie, please do consider the points I presented here before commenting on my review. My main argument is that this movie took the easy way out and just retold events as they were covered by the news media. Would I be wrong to expect that the movie had taken more time to present a story with a background as to what led to the attacks in the first place? Because I believe that when those very hard questions are asked, and then when they are researched and answered as accurately as possible, that that's when a movie or story rises above the sum of its parts. Otherwise, it's just another average movie or story. And I happen to not like average movies. Period!
B004I744AS|3.0|this is not exceptional. basic is the word that comes to mind. It appears limited in suggestion. should offer wider range of misspelled words
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a great contribution to the discussion regarding why we don't have sufficient women in leadership.  Great stories and advice, especially for young ambitious women who are unconciously making choices that may be hindering their career path.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The twists and turns in this book kept me interested until the end; however, the ending was a bit abrupt.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|This is really a cd where the artist didn't try to go &#34;mainstream&#34;. But that's why I learned to really like it. Would have given it 5 stars but i wasn't feeling the 2nd cd too much. Just stop listening to it in my car like 2 weeks ago. But it was in rotation ever since december. I was making up my own words to the songs where i didn't know what he was saying, but i still liked the songs. After I learned the right words from youtube, I loved the songs that much more. This won't be your music if you're a bubbly pop kind of music lover.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I have tried a dozen keyboards.  Really tried then for extended periods.  This is hands down the best and most accurate.
B006PERRMY|5.0|This movie turned out to be one of my favorites of all time.  Not many movies make this list.<br />I forgot that Justin was a singer during the movie.  His acting skills made you engage in the movie without thinking about anything else.  Just a well thought out movie and the acting was top notch!!
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|Gabriel Byrne is unflappable. in spite of murder, mayhem and men in hats.  Albert Finney is wonderfully funny and sinister simultaneously.  The blood and violence is at about the Cohen Brothers normal level, and the characters are right up there, too.  I really like this movie.
B00947N6UG|5.0|wonderful movie! cultural characters that had faded get a new light. new personalities, ideas, reasonsings as to why they are that way, a truly enlightening film. aside from the plot, new characters, and all that wondeful jazz, the artistry in this film is second to none! even if you dont like the movie for the movie itself, nobody can deny the artwork that was invested into every scene &#60;3

B009FZFONO|4.0|In all the 3rd season was very good. I did predict about half way through that the second half of the season would be a LONG drawn out story between the two camps. The four or five episodes in the second half definitely insinuated that a big conclusion was coming, however; that was definitely not the case.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is very enjoyable! I find myself on it all the time. I recommend it, however you can buy things with REAL money.

B008NQYWC0|5.0|Ignore the review titled \\"False Advertisement\\".  Obviously that person has a problem with a well detailed, indepth, and yes rather large book.  It is huge, requiring a strong set of paws to hold this sucker up.  I found myself wishing I'd invested in a Kindle about a quarter of the way through it.  The example of overwriting that \\"False Advertisement\\" gives is both ridiculous, almost comical, which I think is the effect he was shooting for. We should thank your lucky stars that Mr. \\"Falsey Advey\\" is not a writer.<br />King has written a lot of books, in fact, I've only read a handful of them.  The ones that matter:  The Shining, Dead Zone, Firestarter, Different Seasons, Christine, Pet Semetary, It, The Stand, Under the Dome, Misery, and his masterpiece: 11/22/63.<br />This is King's finest storytelling.  And the reader must let go of the common obstacles that constrain the whole Time-travel idea.  Kings handles this by implying that each trip back in time creates different threads in reality.  You really need to  trust the writer to fully enjoy this epic-sized novel.<br />I'd say that for the \\"Kennedy Fanatic\\"  this book might not be for you.  But for the \\"King Fanatic\\"  this book should be right up your alley.  In a big way!<br />The brilliance of the book is the fact that our hero George Amberson must live in the past from 1958 to 1963, why?  Because he can only travel back to the year 1958 and any attempt to return to the future before he completes his mission will reset everything he's done.  So he can't return.  Along the way, George takes on a job, makes some friends, enemies, and falls in love.  Along the way he also saves the lives of others he's known from his past...or his future, I should say.  All of this, according to Mr. \\"False Advertiser\\" would create a butterfly effect that would really screw up the future and that our hero is being very irresponsible.  Well, this is fiction at it's finest folks, I'd say forget everything you've come to learn from other movies and books and trust the writer on this, take his hand and allow him to take you on an awesome journey back in time.  This story will enchant you, enthrall you, excite you, and break your heart.  King has always had a way of stirring my emotions with his writing, creating characters that I love, while others I hate but somehow I can't stop empathizing with.  Bravo, Mr. King, you have given the literary community a masterpiece.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|If you have seen anyone with a Kindle you'll notice how easilly they read through the books. The interface is great and the bookshelf looks awesome. I got an Android tablet and wished I had bought a Kindle when I saw a woman on an airplane reading hers while I stumbled through .pdf documents. I then found this app and now have the best of both worlds! I like this so well I also got Kindle for my PC and read the same library at home or on the go with what ever device I have at my disposal. This app is a must have.<br /><br />UPdate - This program quit working on my Android system with no warning they changed the format of the software so I no can only accesss my Kindle books on my PC with Kindle for the PC. It would have been nice to get a warning from the software manufacturer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun in my opinion.This game is like temple run so If you like Temple run you will love this game! This game is better then Temple run through, you have lots of characters to choose from , an egg hunt ( you look for eggs in the run) ,a variety of boards that you ride on the trains , have a save me button that you press when you die and it makes you get up where you left off and this game has missions that will increase the value of each coin every time you complete 3 missions! This game is very fun ! c:

B009AMANBA|2.0|The acting was first-rate, but the license taken with historical fact was unacceptable to a history nerd.  There was an anachronistic feel to the movie at times.  Also, was Thaddeus Stephens' wig that unsightly?  If it was, that's one detail they could have prettied up to suit me.  It was almost a character, it was so appallingly awful.

As a physician, I have struggled throughout my 30 year professional career with this conflict of what my profession was claiming to be a \\"heart healthy\\" diet and what I was seeing as conflicting data and facts.  Through an exhaustive search and meticulous presentation of the history and conclusions of years of scientific study, Mr. Taubes illuminates with crystal clarity and compelling argument the scientific basis for the primacy of the low carbohydrate diet over low fat high carbohydrate diet that has been recommended by the American Heart Association and the US government for the past 40 years.  Reading this was the single most enlightening and rewarding experience I have ever had in all my years of study of science and medicine.  He is the greatest science author or out time. This makes me embarrassed and ashamed over the harm my profession has caused over the past forty years with misguided dietary recommendations. All I would like to say to Mr. Taubes for his exhaustive unbelievably illuminating and valuable work is, \\"Thank you... Thank you.\\" If you want to get even deeper into the scientific basis for his story, read the prequel to \\"Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It\\" which is \\"Good Calories Bad Calories.\\" If your are scientifically inclined and like rigorous scientific analysis and documentation it will blow you away.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl's points are well researched and grounded. She might make some women uncomfortable, but she's right on so many levels. Our &#34;foremothers&#34; did some amazing groundbreaking work so that we can own businesses and be executives in a country of opportunity.<br /><br />Grab your employees, read the book, start the discussion, see what changes you can produce. Thank you, Sheryl, for writing this book!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I was very surprised by the story, but a little disappointed when it ended. It was great to understand how the mother and son made it through these events. It was a great read to say the least.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Simply a great movie!<br /><br />The disappointing part was that I cant get this on Ultraviolet as Disney is not on board with that and instead are trying to build out their own new streaming service.<br /><br />Also I have noticed that the extras have been getting a bit boring.<br />My 3yr old daughter always asks to see &#34;funny stuff&#34;  like outtakes and such.<br />The best extras we saw are in the Tinkerbell movies.<br /><br />Overall a great movie which is why I keep the 5 stars!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Kid Lawyer was great!  Can't wait to read threat of the Theodore Boone books!  This is a good person!  Great work from John Grisham!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|The story and characters are simply great!  There is enough humor, action, and drama to keep both parents and children entertained.  Still a bit unclear on why the Easter bunny is sending walking eggs to kids but seeing this got my 3yr old excited about finding Easter eggs.<br /><br />Note: Ultraviolet is definitely a must!  Streams from anywhere in the home and on the go (provided you have unlimited or wifi data)
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Took a few chapters for me to catch on to the humor but I  enjoyed it and literally laughed out loud
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This story was silly and simplistic.  I did finish it but it actually was quite boring. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|I am a big fan of the original and American Pie Wedding. American Reunion is a great wrap up to the series (assuming they don't make another one). The characters are great, the story is good about calling back to old jokes from the original without it feeling forced or cheesy.<br /><br />Had no problems with the Blu-ray, got it on time.  The digital copy downloaded with no issues.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|The movie was sweet and charming. If you want a feel-good movie this is for you. The story was amazing and the actors were believable

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think these books were driven by a really good advertising agent.  They are very poorly written.  I somehow got through book 1.  I kept thinking perhaps it would get better since there was so much hype.  Book 2 was also not good although better than book 1. I finally started to skip over the pure sex parts because it did get a bit sickening.  At least there was more of a story line in book 2.  I have started book 3 and I just can't seem to keep wondering what so many people saw in this.  If it was written better maybe it would have lived up to the attention.  I doubt I will finish the 3rd one.  I got really, really sick of her referring to her inner Goddess.
0446554995|5.0|Great book and ending to a triology that has long been awaited. Best writers who just keep getting better and better.
B000FA675C|4.0|Very engrossing with an unexpected twist at the end. May not be palatable for devout Christians or other believers. I am a Christian and although I did not agree with some of the subject matter I did enjoy the book.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of the best book I have read. Read it in French when I was in high school so I decided to read it again. Victor Hugo is a very good French writer.
0375851569|5.0|Purchased for my kindergarten son's birthday.  He loves all the books in the collection.  Looking forward to buying the other set.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is an awesome series!  It has a lot of action and fighting, but it also has strong plot development, politics, character development and full frontal nudity.  So, not for kids.  It is great entertainment with each show keeping you on the edge of your seat wanting to watch them all in a long marathon.<br /><br />It is also a great instructional video if you want to build up your own army so you can be emperor.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a book that I think every married couple should read.... I never related to something as I did this book.
0393089134|5.0|A terrific book in the old sense of the word, one that is at once hilarious and appalling. Burgess's use of \\"Nadsat\\" was one of my favorite vesches about the novel--it brings the reader closer into the mind of Alex while still reminding them just what kind of person he is/was. It's clear Burgess crafted every word (or \\"slovo\\") to have subconsious meaning outside of its mere Russian: Nadsat is full of double-meanings and onomatopoeia. Heard by an English speaker \\"baboochka,\\" or old woman, sounds mocking, even babyish, \\"horrorshow\\" (good) has rather dark implications, or zoobies (teeth), which makes you make an evil smile just saying it.<br /><br />The story is at once fatalistic and brilliant. However, I honestly think the final chapter tolchooks the story off balance. In the entire rest of the book almost nobody undergoes any character development--other than possibly F. Alexander. But this transformation, or regression, rather, into a vengeful kroovy-peeting vesch is due to the extreme violence he was forced to bear witness to--possibly similar to Alex's undergoing the Luvidico Technique? So to have even any character in the novel undergo a development, let alone the narrator, seems a distinct lapse in tone. This, of course, is totally open to debate. In my mind, if one simply ignores the last chapter, Burgess has created a work of aesthetic perfection--a book for the ages.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is my Dad's account but I read this book. It is awesome and is a little sad. It has some sad parts and some funny parts. This book rocks!!!!!
0425264351|1.0|I am usually very good about not buying a re-released book..so when I received the Killing Floor and noticed it said on the front cover the first Jack Reacher book, I was not happy.  I put in a search for the most current Reacher book and it came up...so I ordered it for a friend and then found out it was a re-release.  When you read and order as many books as I do you do not always remember the titles, so we depend on Amazon to list them according to release date-not re-release date!  I am going to go back to buying my books locally where I can check the front cover for release dates since the order on Amazon does not seem correct!  This was a total waste of money since I already read it years ago and was looking forward to a new adventure.  I do not re-read books, I donate them after 1 reading.  What a disappointment!  Partly my fault since I didn't do more investigation, but I shouldn't have to.  Now I have the full original release dates...you may want to post it......Killing Floor 1197 Die Trying 1998 Tripwire 1999 Running Blind 2000 Echo Burning 2001 Without Fail 2002 Persuader 2003 The Enemy 2004 One Shot 2005 The Hard Way 2006 Bad Luck and Trouble 2007 Nothing to Lose 2008 Gone Tomorrow 2009 -61 Hours 2010 Worth Dying for 2010 A Wanted Man 2012 Never Go Back 2013...Hopefully this will help your readers not to order something they don't want!

1423113462|5.0|I've had this book on my TBR pile ever since it was released, but never got around to reading it until last week. I'm not sure why-maybe because I knew I'd have to wait another year for book 2 to come out? That's probably it. Because now I'll be tortured by the immense amount of time between now and next fall.<br /><br />This book had me from the start. Jason, an amnesiac turned hero, wakes to find himself on a bus, surrounded by people he doesn't recognize, going to who knows where. His memories are gone; he doesn't even remember his last name.<br /><br />Some old faces are back, Annabeth and Thalia included. It was nice to get a mix of the old and the new, spicing it up a little while not completely letting go of the characters that made me love Camp Half-Blood in the first place.<br /><br />Once I finally started reading, I couldn't stop. Like the Percy Jackson series, the entire book is an adventure, filled with marvelous villians, unexpected plot twists, and quotes worth rolling on the floor laughing for. I love Mr. Riordan's sense of humor; it's one of the things that first attracted me to the series. I wanted to read more of that.<br /><br />While I'm furious at the wait, I'm delighted by this book. It's crazy and awesome (crawsome?), funny and sad, sweet and sour. It has a little bit of everything, all mixed up into one delicious novel. I can't wait to read more about these characters, their quest, and Camp Half-Blood. I give The Lost Hero 5/5 stars. If you haven't read it, you're definitely missing out.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This is one of those movies that my son watches over and over.  This movie is also sophisticated enough for parents to enjoy.
1455508977|4.0|I picked up this book mainly because I knew there would be a movie coming out about it next year, and I've been meaning to read more Nicholas Sparks, anyway. The novel sounded interesting, but I had no idea just how wrapped up in the plot I would get, or how much  I'd end up loving this book.<br /><br />The characters were interesting, and different. I liked Logan most of all, maybe because he was so hard to figure out. At first I was thinking that he was a simple, not very complex person, before I relaxed there are layers to him. Everything he does is for a reason, whether he acknowledges it or not. It sets him apart from the rest, in a good way.<br /><br />The setting was lovely, and I could really picture everything that was going on. I liked that imagery, and it helped to draw me further into the book. I couldn't stop flipping the pages, and ended up staying up late just to finish. With all of the twists and turns, the unexpected additions and a wonderful ending, I wasn't wanting for drama.<br /><br />I liked how the `luck' theme pervaded the book, really tying everything together, both bringing characters together and pulling them apart. I loved reading about Logan's backstory, and seeing what had led him to this part of his life. This Nicholas Sparks book is great, and definitely makes me want to read more by this author. I give The Lucky One 4/5 stars. Definitely recommended!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Really liking Bruno Mars, his band and music. Not the typical pop stuff all over the radio . . . .
0545140323|5.0|This was a cute, quick read. I love the idea of sticking with your friends, and not letting boy troubles ruin your high school years. I see it happen way too often with my own friends. They get caught up with a boy, start ditching their friends to go on dates, then get their heart broken. Of course, this isn't the case all of the time. There are always exceptions.<br /><br />The only little pet peeve I had with this book was a scene in the beginning. The Club went to Homecoming, and Penny kept going on about how odd it was that a group of girls were attending date-less, going with friends. I'm not sure how it is for other schools, but for mine, that's not odd in the slightest. Half the female population does this . . . Though that might just say something about the quality of the boys we have to pick from.<br /><br />That said, I loved this book. It had me wanting to blast some Beatles songs, get together with my friends, and have a girls night. This book has a great message, that a lot of YA books today don't provide. Boys aren't everything. And your friends can be much more fun than a boyfriend ever could be.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Love this movie. And, it arrived quickly. Was shipped securely and arrived undamaged. Big PLUS was that immediate access to play the movie via Amazon Prime was included. A nice feature!
1423101502|5.0|Like all Percy Jackson books, this novel was fast-paced and full of funny lines and characters. But I love these books, and I'm sad knowing this is the final one. The new Camp Half-Blood series coming out next fall will have new characters, apparently with a few familiar faces popping in every now and then.<br />But still. It's Percy.<br />This son of Poseidon is a great leading character. He has normal temptations and flaws and it is easy to relate to him.<br />I love how the setting is described so vividly, especially in the fight scenes. I've only been to NYC twice, but I could picture everything that Percy was seeing perfectly.<br />Rachel Elizabeth Dare makes another appearance in this book. She's more defined in this one, and more information of her background and such are given, which I liked.<br />The ending wasn't cliff-hanger like the others (obviously, it's the last book), but I'll forgive it for being a little cliche. Sometimes we need a little bit of that thrown in there.<br />The Greek mythology was spot on. I love how it connects to everything! These books have me itching to read another book with Greek mythology tied it.<br />\\"The Last Olympian\\" definitely gets 5/5 stars. It's a great book.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is a great documentary that details the inner workings of what is possibly the humblest of all Michelin starred restaurants.  I found most interesting the level of dedication that the patriarchal founder, Jiro, puts into his art.  His philosophy and full immersion into sushi as a way of life is quite entertaining and insightful.  For anyone who enjoys cooking, sushi, or appreciates great food, this movie will keep you captivated as it chronicles the mundane such as how the rice is prepared to the intricate detail of how Jiro even seats his customers.  Particularly entertaining, are his sons' feelings of inadequacy of not being able to fill their father's shoes. Definitely a movie that you will want to watch with something to eat close by, as you will most likely get hungry.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Some of the reviews here really go out of the way to denigrate this version of the movie. What a potential purchaser should take into consideration is quite simply this is not a never before seen edition either side. The extended version is by and large the one seen on tv years ago and realistically mostly fare for the diehard fan not a remastered reimaged product it is flawed but justifiably so as it was an attempt to cobble together left over bits and pieces to epand the narative and give more background story. Enjoy that for what it is.
1439102732|1.0|This is by far my least favorite Jodi Picout book.  I think one of the things that I like about Ms. Picoult books is that you can not tell her position.  In fact, I think that was one of the things that has brought Ms. Picoult the success she has received.  However, this book couldn't be farther from her normal.  I recently attended a book festival where I heard authors speak (including Ms. Picoult...loved her).  One author(not Ms. Picoult)  however said something that hit home with me particularly in this book.  The author stated an opinion that if you are going to write about a hot political topic of the day especially in fiction, your chances of having a super successful book are iffy.  Here's why.....you are either singing to the choir and thus not really trying to convince anyone of anything or you are trying to convince those that disagree with you that they are wrong.  That is what I believe Ms. Picoult has done here.  She is trying to convince you and make a political point about marriage equality and good on her but the execution of it is not good.  I believe this is a passionate subject for her but there is none of the neutrality from the author that you experience in her other works.  She is trying to convince you that all Christians are intolerant, evil spirited, holier than thou people, and fanatical ( think Hillsboro Baptist Church folks....they even make an appearance in this book).  I applaud her for her position, just am really disgusted and disappointed in this book compared to all the other Picoult books I have read.  I kept reading to to find some redeeming quality...sadly I found little.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|A very enjoyable read, not as good as the first two books in the series. At this point I am starting to expect all the terrible things that happen.
B000SEFM6K|4.0|This novel was written in 1859, which is remarkable because the intriguing characters and the narrative force seem very modern.  It is a mystery, but I would characterize it as a romantic thriller.  The mysterious woman in white appears in the first few pages and the need to understand her tragic secret is one of the propelling forces of the book.  As Walter Hartright attempts to unravel her secret he is even more deeply motivated to right the injustices he sees, especially those done to women.  It is a skillfully written book with sympathetic main characters, action, ideals all blending into an entrancing narrative.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|This is a great little book for small children.  My 3 year old granddaughters like to read this and pick out the correct number on each page.  It's a cute learning book and I'd recommend it for a little one.  The pages are cute and colorful and that helps to hold their attention.  Plus, it's The Hungry Caterpillar...how could you go wrong?  :)

B001ANYDAO|3.0|Let me first day there are some very interesting points and portions to this book. However it often dragged - too often reiterating a point far too long. Finally upon reaching the end of Gladwell 's writing, it becomes a bit difficult to identify the writer's true point.

B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Several reviews have compared the EVER to the Rayovac-so I thought I'd take pictures of the two units, side-by-side, on bright and on dim.  You can find the images near the product image.<br /><br />A quick note about the fuss about putting the batteries in the units-both units have the same design; but here's the \\"trick\\"-line up the arrow on the base with the arrow on the lantern and then-insert the plastic tip by the arrow on one side into the groove by the arrow on  the other, then push the base towards the lantern and twist a quarter turn; you're done.  Very easy as long as you insert the tip into the groove as the arrows indicate.

Has a lot of adds and sometimes in order to get them off, I have to get out the games and back in. It 's not really that bad but maybe others will find it annoying as I had but the game is worth it and it is free. MobilityWare did a good job with the app.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Great movie. The title threw me off a bit: it's about a lawyer who pretty much operates out of his car. Good twisty plot.

B000FC2L1Y|4.0|This is one of my favorite books of the series... In this book you witness the blossoming of the relationship between Brianna and Roger. Oh sure, there's plenty of Claire and Jamie - but it's Brianna and Roger's love that takes center stage.

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Not sure why I  loved this but I did. Something new and imaginative. The story of finding your self but not losing who you are.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|One of the greatest bands in music play with an incendiary clairvoyance that will have you wishing you were there.  Tony Williams and Herbie Handcock alone had me in awe, but the amazing Wayne Shorter and a perfect Ron Carter play loose and fast and cement Miles Davis' reputation as the best band leader of his generation.  A must have for modern jazz lovers.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Affordable price and works really well. Went from a $90.00 R.A.T mouse to this Anchor mouse. Really enjoying it. Only problem is that i dont know how to set the keys to work with browser (back page page and forward page).
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and use it a lot.  Gives your brain a lot of exercise.  Would recommend for anyone who likes card games.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One the better scifi books I've ever read. I practically couldn't put the book down. The sarcastic and irreverent wit of the main character made me chuckle the whole way through.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The first time I heard this, on a free stream on iTunes just before its release, I wasn't sure what to make of it. 20/20 Experience is far different from Timberlake's previous albums, which are high-energy and made for gross amounts of overplay on the radio. It was also very retro, very throwback. Suit & Tie, probably the most radio-ready track on the album apart from the more N-Sync reminiscent \\"Mirrors,\\" reminded me of old-school Michael Jackson. It's gleeful and infectious (watch the SNL performance if you can, and you will fall in love with this song just watching Timberlake dance to it). But more I listen to this album, the more I love every song on it. The very primal \\"Hold the Wall\\" has been in my head for days, alternating with the buttery sweet \\"Pusher Love Girl.\\" But I think it's \\"Tunnel Vision\\" that wins my honors for favorite track. Each 7+ minute track feels like two or even three songs in one, which some might feel is self-indulgent. It only makes me happier.<br /><br />The musicality of this album, thanks to longtime collaborator Timbaland, has elevated to JT to a whole new plane of sophistication in my mind. He's not playing to the Bieber/One Direction crowd here. He's playing to grownups. Sexy, sexy grownups.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|This was a great show! It's too bad they stopped two shows short. I would love to see the character development as they began to understand River's powers. Also Mal and Inora. Loved the show and the movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot wait for the next season 4<br />They should make the next season longer<br />I recommend this for people that cannot watch the season when it's on
0345528581|5.0|We use this book weekly.  My husband, who is not a young chicken anymore, has beefed up considerably.  That wasn't the goal, but turns out to be the end result.  I had a 20 year old injury that has been improved by doing this regimen.  Don't be intimidated or turned off by the big guy on the front cover.  It's an excellent system to try, and after a year of using it, we're the better for it.  Takes no equipment, and doesn't wear you out (of course, you can push yourself).  Imagine if you didn't spend the money at the gym, and did this for a year?<br /><br />I believe there is a new version out for women.  I was fine using the men's, but will probably look up the women's just out of curiousity.  Seller was fine, and speedy. No complaints there.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|Good 3D ,but very confusing long drawn out confusing plot.I smell a sequel coming and I'll pass!!!Maybe i'm a little slow,but I just don't get the plot of this other dimension that exists in Silent Hill. Very confusing movie that not even the pretty good 3D can save. Good 3D scenes include dust particles floating out of screen,another when the female star arrives at Silent Hill the street seems to stretch into living room. Pass on this one unless your a fan of the series.
B004K00NEO|5.0|Great movie, Seller was speedy.  I knew the movie prior to purchasing it on CD, so it wasn't a surprise that I'd like it. Kids and adults alike love this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun plot super easy in expert mode. Could be a little more challenging. Maybe hide things better all in all a fun game
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Easy read. Kinda like Twilight, but not. Characters are easy to like. Can't wait to start the next book. Not too mushy either.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|First of all, this thing is absolutely is worth the price. Even my cheap 20 dollar sony headphones sound better with it! Makes the sound more lively and less dull when using the standard setting (dot has no light). I have yet to try it with better quality headphones, although I will once I get my audio technica ath m50s. As for the build quality, it feels pretty cheap, especially the eq slider. Nothing has broke yet though, and it seems sufficient, especially for the price you pay. It is also a bit cumbersome to use on the go, but not that bad either. My only complaint is that when charging with the usb cable and listening, there is quite a lot of static. The good news is that this doesn't happen as much when using a usb to power plug adapter, so you can just do that instead.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|I was very glad to finally find the Downton Stories and not a behind the scenes book.  I have only just discovered the series and this book was great as I know have a better understanding as to the background story line.  I only wish the next season was available as well!  If you cannot find the reruns anywhere,  this works just as well!
B007RI56NY|5.0|I love the entire CD.  My daughter loves it to. Thank God for music cause at this time in her life (15yrs) its about the only thing we can come together on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game atleast once a day. it is a great game!!!! great great great great Fantastic! great great ...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love a book that is well written! A wonderful story that kept me turning the pages, and wishing it would last a little longer.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting and story. The fact that it was based on a true story made it even more compelling.<br />Even though you knew how the story ends, it still drew me in and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This is one  thing I did and got addict to it immediately.  I think for a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;  should be better because the 7&#34; is a little tiny.  If you like music get it.
B00B935SUY|5.0|great music, great historical inside look that takes you on a journey.<br />Dave Grohl is the last of a dying breed of true rock and roll genius.<br />This movie gives you an inside look at the recording process with great stories, fun and emotion.<br />It sounded great on my TV and left me wanting more
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|The Kindle Fire HD has already camera.  Its an alternative if needed for any reason, but in my case resulted redundant.  I ended up removing it from my device.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|So, first off, Evil Dead 2 was really just a reimagining-remake of Evil Dead.  So, too, is this movie.  How is this movie different and why should you care about it?  Well, it takes all of the elements, scenes, desperate tone and sets of Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 and then distorts them just enough that even though we recognize each of them, we never really know when or how they're coming.<br /><br />The Evil Dead playbook includes elements like reading from the wrong damned book, running through wall crawlspaces, erratic POV chases in the woods, tree rape (for lack of a better word), entrapment in the woods, untrustworthy mirror images, laughing deer heads, slamming doors, chainsaws, severing of \\"infected\\" hands, the famous bite on the hand from an infected significant other, burying your significant other, the rise from the dead of your significant other, the possessed pretending to be human to appear vulnerable, singing in the cellar...oh, and about 110 gallons of liquid gore!  Might I add, it's all real gore, not some CGI spray coming from CGI demons.<br /><br />So I told you it had all the same elements AND I just listed them.  So did I ruin anything for you?  Believe it or not, NO.  While all of these elements are present, they have been chopped up, modified, meshed with other elements, spread across the entire cast or lumped into one.  For example, there is no character that fills the role of Ash.  Not really.  But you'll see \\"Ash\\" moments played out by different characters as well as \\"Ash\\" lines and other Ash-isms.  What's great about this is that you don't know who, if anyone, is going to survive this movie.  What a nice touch.  It all feels so familiar to Evil Dead fans yet, despite this familiarity, you never know what's in store except for a few iconic scenes.<br /><br />The lighting, set design and cinematography were perfect.  The mood went from \\"something doesn't feel quite right\\" to straight up chilling and surreal.  Obscure camera angles brilliantly contributed by making tense moments much less comfortable even for unshakable horror fans.<br /><br />Likewise, the characters were great. I had doubts at first.  When we meet them it feels like any well-produced horror movie.  David (Shiloh Fernandez; Red Riding Hood, Deadgirl), Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci; Carriers), Olivia (Jessica Lucas; Cloverfield, The Covenant) and David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) all go out to a cabin in the woods to help David's sister Mia (Suburgatory's Jane Levy showing us that more than just a sweetie) kick her drug addiction which has nearly killed her.  Natalie seems naïve, David has never been there for his family before, Olivia is a take charge nurse helming this mission and Eric is pleasantly reminiscent of what they're remaking as a 70s-80s curious yet skiddish kind of guy who \\"thinks\\" he knows what he's in for.  Mia is likable, but you can see she has the will and flightiness to be problematic even without evil demons' involvement.<br /><br />As this intervention-rehab sets sail, one of them reads a few words from a skin-bound tome in the carrion-littered basement (a bit of a red flag already, I think) and some odd things start happening.  But no matter how odd, out of character, escalating to psychotic and murderous the events, to some they fall under the veil of Mia having a breakdown.  The actors all do a fine job.<br /><br />The big question on everyone's mind seems to be \\"was this remake worthy of Evil Dead [and Evil Dead 2]?\\"  I think that whether or not people like this movie, the answer will be a mixed bag.  My personal opinion is YES IT IS.  Granted, there is none of the slapstick comedy of Evil Dead 2 or uber-over-the-top maniacal demon taunts of Evil Dead.  The only laughs you'll get are familiar lines that were funny in the originals thoughtfully woven throughout the dialogue in such understated ways that unless you're a diehard fan you'll probably miss them altogether.  However, we get every bit of the gastrointestinal gross-out gore and then some!!!  On top of that we get some truly brutal and sadistic scenes that will make you cover your mouth, cover your eyes, hold your breath or spit swears of disbelief at the screen.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that Sam Raimi was only a producer and that this was Fede Alvarez' first feature length picture.<br /><br />So please, give this a chance.  Don't skip it because the last ten horror remakes, reboots or re-imaginings disappointed you. This is clearly a remake, but the scenes you'll see never feel like you've seen them before.trointestinal gross-out gore and then some!!!

B0091REZMW|5.0|I used to play this on my phone and was so happy to find it on my kindle. Great way to pass the time plus there is always new challenges.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Enjoyed more than I thought since I'm not 40 nor have kids. If you like Judd Apatow's movies, you'll dig this, too.
B00004XQ83|1.0|Watched it and wanted the music but it was bad too.  I guess it is just a matter of  opinion
B00138J342|5.0|God I freaking love this record.  2nd best Pearl Jam next to Yield and one of the best opening 1, 2 tracks ever.  This is alone-on-a-deserted-island music.  I've grown so tired of Elderly Woman after hearing it at just about every show I've seen... And Indifference pisses me off b/c it usually means the show's over, and they're not going to be playing Yellow Ledbetter... Otherwise, this is just about perfect.  I think I will go listen to it again now.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has the ongoing feature which gives me only the information I need at the time I check it and also if I want fill weather data it's available.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Michael Connelly has another entertaining, intriguing novel for his series. Again great character and plot development and writing style makes the novels a joy to read. I particularly enjoy his continuing revelation of his protagonist, Harry  Bosch's character, personality and values. One becomes very attached to him.
B003L77G06|5.0|We watch Modern Family every week but send the DVD set to our friends in the UK.  They can't get enough of this show.  Too bad it isn't seen in England.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|I love watching Criminal Minds.  They have great guest stars in roles that differ from what I'm used to seeing...such as Matthew Lillard being a pedophile/killer training a kid to kill along with him.  Great show!
B008220D7S|4.0|This movie is more of a quirky drama, not a straight up comedy. If you liked Judd Apatow's older work, then you should enjoy this. Paul and Leslie worked great together, very entertaining and interesting.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I expected a little more imagination. The story was cute but will not stay in my mind like hopeless did. I want a good read that will have me sad or happy at the end. I just feel like moving on and hope my next pick is better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an imagination!<br />I am one of those people always trying to predict what happens next. Not happening with this book. Keeps ya guessing for sure. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a very helpful app that wakes me up every morning. And I'm only rating this because I'm tired of the pop ups
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 5 year old grandson showed me subway surfer and we enjoy collecting scions and then spending them. I find the game challenging and fun.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I know this book got some great reviews & I did enjoy, but there were times when I just wanted to smack Abby. She didn't want any repeat of her past & she constantly accused Travis of being what she didn't want her future to be, but it was ok for her to always do things from her past. All in all it was a good story & was happy to see how things turned out for them. Looking forward to seeing what the future holds for them.
B000002USN|5.0|I am so happy I purchased this cd.  The collaborations with the various artists is absolutely delightful. Definitely would recommend it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is fun but all the good things in the game are bought with invest points that you can't get withought buying them or doing certain objectives that some use invest points to finish. It's good for a free game I guess, but of you want a good virtual city game, I suggest buying SimCity.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|A very good read, all three of the books, easily followed .  The books are hard to put down once started.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is good. I think the players need to not be so expensive. But other than that it is a good game.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|paste itself was good, took almost 2 weeks to arrive, but worked with no issues. i would order it again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am a twilight fan and love the l.j smith books. Also a fan of Nora Roberts so I like easy reads that entertain and take me to another place and time. I call these beach books. With that said I really enjoyed this book. I got swept up in the romance and just flew through it. I can't wait to finish the entire series (BTW I love books that are series).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, I'd definitely recommend for kids and adults too! It's a little bit like temple run.I personally find it highly addictive and whenever I can ill be on it.<br /><br />Thanks. Xxx
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book! It has fun adventures, magic and some great mythology for any person who likes magic, adventure, tragedy, romance, mystery, suspense and mythology all rolled in to one. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is keeping me busy and is really fun. You can play it in the car or just at home. It is the ideal game if you need just a little rest. You will get hooked.
B004XMMSZG|3.0|This product does work as advertised, however it is far from \\"crystal clear\\".  There is a distinct hissing or scratching noise that this product has when connected to a speaker.  I particularly notice this when listening to music which uses symbols (on drum kits) as the scratchiness is quite noticeable.<br /><br />The first unit was randomly cutting out, so CableJive sent me a new unit.  Great customer service on their end.  I still recommend this company to people, as they truly innovate.  However, I would say this only will work for people who are satisfied with a wireless solution that slightly degrades sound.<br /><br />Do not listen to other reviewers.  There is a distinct difference between the sound produced by a directly connected ipod and the dockboss air.<br /><br />This product feels like a slightly better beta product, so hopefully they will be able to get it closer to crystal clear in the near future.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|WONDERFUL REALISTIC VIEW OF WHEN OUR LORD & SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST WALKED AMONGST US & DIED FOR OUR SINS! AMEN!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks. Love how the game always changes to keep it fresh. Unlockable are great just wish you get get money faster
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game and sometimes on a kindle you can't move it but with subway surfer it works would advise you to get it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game feels like you are with a real horse.  You can do things to improve the health and happiness too. I am constantly on the game. It is totally worth getting and if you don't like it, it is free
1475143389|5.0|I really wanted to get in shape, so I bought this book along with the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]].<br /><br />My goal was to pack on muscle.  I've always been skinny and I wanted to gain a lot of muscle but maintain low bodyfat at the same time.<br /><br />This book explains some very easy, simple concepts to get you started.  For a beginner, it's help you understand the basics of bodybuilding and for that I give it 5 stars.  It's a quick, easy read too.<br /><br />I continued my learning with the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] which delved a lot deeper into the training, diet, supplementation, and overall attitude and mindsets you need to gain muscle fast and make it a lifestyle.  For that, I recommend it highly as well.<br /><br />I've been working out for about 4 months straight now.  I've gained nearly 20 pounds of muscle while losing fat at the same time.  I'm on my way to getting the body I want.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|The file format could be a little more user friendly, but for a free app it does the job adequately.
0060987464|5.0|Awesome book.  Neil Strauss, co-author, almost always delivers, especially when he's profiling celebrities.  His only poor efforts have been departures from that arena.<br /><br />This book on Manson, however, is totally fascinating.  Manson, who wrote the book with Strauss, reveals TONS about his personal life and his family background.  This sets the stage for his career, a train-wreck tour de force filled with incredible highs and painful lows.<br /><br />Manson is a part of Americana from the '90s and this is a beautiful potrait of his life and sordid career.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The locale was a bit tiresome and repetitive but it was compelling enough to get me to a satisfying ending<br />.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|I am a true fan of this show, I think the drama, intrique, and passion<br />this time evoked is evidence that if you have power (its the same in any time) you<br />have everything.  I loved every episode and couldn't stop myself from<br />finishing the series quickly.  The final episode was one for the history books.<br /><br />Even though the horror of the excess they indulged in,<br />(in comparison to everyone else) is truly awful, you can't help but fall in love<br /> with the characters and sympathize with their tragedies and shortcomings.<br />It makes you think about your own failures and realize if you aren't one of<br />the rich and powerful then you don't have near as far to fall.<br /><br />The acting is amazing and before long you are rooting for the bad guys.  Personally<br />I think the mark of a truly great actor is their ability to make you love them<br />even when they don't deserve it.<br /><br />I believe this show is as good if not better than The Tudors, and I watched every<br />episode of that also.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|I did not get to see this movie in the theater so I was looking forward to seeing it on Blueray. I was not disappointed. This movie is just plain fun.
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|I really liked these when I bought them while pregnant for my daugher. She &#34;discovered&#34; her feet about 2 weeks ago, so I immediately busted these out and put them on her feet. She could care less. Infact, if I put them on her, she waits until I take them off of her to go for her toes. She just wants the real little piggies, not these. I guess it's just a risk, I'm sure some babies probably love them.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show is fantastic. The production values are unmatched on TV.  The show looks better on the bluray than on TV.  Good extras.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super addictive and can easily be updated from any device.I recommend this game to everyone and all ages.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is an amazing, fun, and addicting game. I love how every month the game updates and changes to a different city in a different part of the world (e.i. Rome, Sydney). You can change your character and hoverboard (used in sticky situations while playing) to your liking. I gave this a 4 because the game gliches a lot and I usually have to pause the game for a while and try again hoping for no gliches. Overall the game is excellent!! I recommend YOU to get it and for you to tell others to get it as well. Peace!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|anyone who loves to hike, will love this book ! this is a book we all need to rememberwhen we think we can do something

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I loved this movie! I actually didnt take my little one to see it in theaters & now I wish I had. Its a cute story, that has a good moral. The movie also keeps my almost 3 yr old's attention. I catch him singing along even if he isnt watching it (if its playing in the back ground).
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This released recordings of the late Jimi Hendrix is all the old blues music I grew to love growing up in the 60's! Jimi peaks on many songs while accompanist jam out! OUTSTANDING! You will love it if you like any Jimi Hendrix music! Back to the Blues Man!

B002XTXG1G|5.0|I had grown oh so tired with the horribly ironic, hipster, indie doodoo that keeps getting put out. Between mindless action, chick flick (keeping milking it Nicholas Sparks) and the not so funny overly vulgar college nonsense, I seriously needed something to come along that was different. Bronson was the answer. From the cinematography to the soundtrack, 10 across the board. Its arty, in its own way, but edgy. i loved it. Bronson was a very refreshing change from all the shmut and reminded me why I love movies.
B00260HH3K|5.0|My kids all play the Dragonball Z Game, and watch the cartoons on TV, and when I saw that they had made a live-action movie I had to get it for my kids.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book was not at all what I expected. There was to much medical lingo for the average person to understand. Add to that on my kindle the book stopped at 72% and the other 28% was credits. To me it definately was not worth the money.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a good book. Although I find  that Sandberg rambles at times her message is powerful and inspires me.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Thoroughly emjoyed the book.  Good humor fast moving and very uypbeat.  I wish I would be so energetic at 100.
B004478AS4|1.0|You can almost hear the pounding drums building to the book`s inevitable ending.  The story is a powerful condemnation of imperial benevolence.  I enjoyed the rhythm and pace and how each short story wove itself into the fabric of the book.  Sad ending.  I would read more
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am loving this game! I find it challenging enough to keep playing but not so difficult that I give up!!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Before watching this movie, I did not know that Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, and Anne Hathaway could sing.  I am impressed.  I have heard people criticized the actors' voice was too raw.  So what?  Actually a bit of rawness make the story more real and down to earth.  It would have been unreasonable to expect an army officer, a prisoner, and a prostitute to be top-notch opera singers.  I highly recommend this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Did not like the graphic goodness and felt that the ending left me wanting for more. Sad for all of the people she loved or cared about were killed. The book was almost too fantastical.

You can use many terms to describe this film but this addition to the Evil Dead franchise manages to create a niche all it's own composed of some appreciated unpredictability, recycled ideas from other films and a plethora of gore soaked goodies. Set in present day the film centers on a group of friends gathered to help a young woman beat her heroin addiction. Mia played by Jane Levy in an uneven but decent performance is that young woman who is the first to fall victim to the notorious necronomicon which of course leads to a night of sadistic horror, the likes of which you've come to expect from these films. Solid and sexy Shiloh Fernandez turns up as her abandoning brother with a slightly melodramatic past, handsome Lou Taylor Pucci as his too curious friend Eric, the talented and gorgeous  Jessica Lucas as the most believable of the bunch Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, David's girlfriend and the not so great actress of the group. The direction from Fede Alvarez is solid I think if a little generic although I am impressed by the enormity of this guy's balls. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous from it's heightened suspenseful camera angles and the ones that capture the scenery in just the right way to the beautiful composition of light through out the film, it's really very commendable. Speaking of commendable the old school nod to practical effects is much appreciated and way more effective than the CGI crap that crowds multiplexes nowadays. But all in all the film feels feels a little recycled with not much an identity of it's own. it borrows freely from the Evil Dead films and other similar films like it and in truth feels more like a sequel than an actual remake and in that sense it never really feels like it can stand on it's own. Don't get me wrong the film has a barrage of wonderfully gory set pieces but when you look up Evil Dead 30 years from now on the net I'm pretty sure this won't be what comes up.The screenplay however does have some nice touches the reasoning behind them staying is well though out even if the opening is a little hammy and confusing and the constant merry go round effect of who is the films real main character is wonderfully deceptive.  That being said, my expectations were set very high I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead films and I had recently watched them and the buzz on this film has been incredible and I bought into a little against my better judgement. When it first started out I didn't feel much of anything and than as it went on it was decent enough but the disappointment started to creep in. I can't say that the feeling ever truly went away completely but the film culminates too such a grand, horrific, entertaining, completely over the top, ickfest finale I couldn't help it when the slight blues fell away replaced with a childish grin that helped me to remember why I have been such a big horror fan since I was a kid. And for that reason alone it's more than worth the price of admission a few times. 4/5
B00457WZEI|5.0|I think that it is a great book for 11 and up. I think I like this so much because it shows that there is always hope or happiness even in the darkest hour. It dose have very sad moments that I think might make the strongest people cry a little. I will not tell you everything.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Very pleased with Lincoln, thoroughly with what I expected.  Argo was new....once I realized the era, and once again, excellent acting and scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I've played on my kindle yet I've played other games like but none compare to this it's very addicting the only thing I don't understand is who ever made the game why they made it so hard to get other characters
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I got it because a friend recommend it to me, if you are thinking about geting it DO IT! I would pay money for it still cant believe its free. This game gets 5 stars!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great game. The characters in it are so alive- it's like you're actually there. I love it and it's perfect for children (opinion).
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This record clearly indicates the jazzy compositional bent Jimi was feeling just before his untimely death-Sublimely funky! Jimi with Horns!!!!
1885167776|5.0|1) Swami Vivekananda said, \\"Take up ONE idea. Make that ONE idea your life - think of it, dream of it, and live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is way great spiritual giants are produced.\\" IMHO, this book seems to be an exposition of this quote.  I have a feeling this ONE thing concept or paradigm has the potential to be the ONE big idea that is practical enough that we can use for the rest of our ONE life.<br /><br />It is simple, effective and efficient.  You won't run the risk of \\"Monomania\\" or the idea that \\"When all you have is a Hammer, everything looks like a ..\\".  I only hope the Law of Diminishing returns does not apply to this concept because of the Monkey Mind effect, the simple passage of time and the mind's predilection for the next \\"new\\" idea.<br /><br />2) The truth behind this book is something we all know intuitively, but the author has researched it, codified it, shaped it and presented it.  With elegance and brilliance.  I have a zillion concepts floating in my monkey mind without any unifying idea or concept to link them. But, this book seems to have the potential to provide that missing link. Time will tell.<br /><br />3) I don't have the patience to read a book cover to cover.  But, the concept of this book enabled me to read this book end to end in one sitting. It was easy, applying the Author's paradigm along the way to even reading the book, ONE sentence at a time.<br /><br />4) I feel that I have come across this concept, shall we say, tangentially, in the books by other authors before, for. e.g. Alan Lakein in his book \\"How to take control of your time and life\\" - \\"Ask what is the most important thing to do right now?\\", or Tom Hopkins in his book, \\"Official Guide to Success', ask incessantly - \\"What is the most productive thing possible you can do right now?\\" or Dave Allen's \\"Getting Things Done\\"  - \\"What's the next action?\\"  or Darren Hardy's \\"Compound Effect\\" which is about \\"compounding effect of many small actions\\", or Jeff Olson's \\"Slight Edge\\" which is about \\"how many small changes done repeatedly can change your life\\" or Brian Tracy's \\"Eat the Frog\\" which is about \\"Doing your ONE ugliest task first\\" or Napoleon Hill's, \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" which is about among other insightful ideas \\"Think with a burning desire over your ONE definite major purpose\\" or Robert Maurer's Kaizen based, \\"ONE small step can change your life\\" .. or the Susan Schneider's \\"Science of Consequences\\" which is about \\"There are consequences to everything we do \\" or the age-old concept of \\"Divide and Conquer\\" or the Meditation methods based on repetition of ONE mantra/word at a time ..<br /><br />This book kind of but not exactly expounds the same concept but from a different, but refreshing perspective with a heavy weighting and immersion on intuitive intelligent prioritization of prime priorities with a twist on simplicity, atomicity, efficiency and effectiveness and with many more new and deeply, insightful flavors on multitasking, discipline, balance, willpower etc. It resonates very well with me.<br /><br />5) \\"ONE THING\\" .. It is a simple idea to adapt.. simple to execute but profound and far-reaching in its consequences.  The author presents a persuasive case with many, many examples. One of the ideas mentioned I found fascinating is about needing discipline only long enough until something becomes a habit.  The Discipline-Time graph presented has the potential to free up any guilt over any lack of discipline.<br /><br />6) This ONE thing paradigm seems capable of clearing up the foggy mental quagmire and freeing up our mental resources to focus better and be more productive.  The biggest challenge might be there are SO MANY, \\"ONE THINGS\\", we need to take care of in different areas of our lives.  But, I am hoping as we continue to get better at applying this concept, we will become skilled at focussing on the next \\"ONE THING\\", and only that \\"ONE THING\\", ad infinitum.<br /><br />7) If you are going to do read ONE book this year, get this ONE book.  This is ONE thing you will not regret.  My gut feeling is this book is destined to become a bestseller classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Ready to read the third and final book. So curious to find out how it ends for them
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|As a huge fan of both The West Wing and The Civil War I was impressed with &#34;Lincoln&#34;...touting great production values and acting from an excellent cast the film was not your typical action-packed Civil War film but an in-depth look at the incredible work and sweat Lincoln put into getting the 13th Amendment through Congress.Daniel Day Lewis does a phenomenal job as Lincoln as well as Tommy Lee Jones and Jared Harris.It is a long film(150 min) but well worth the viewing.
B004GYY714|2.0|I uninstalled it because it was not useful for me. First, its size was too big for running on my device (Kindle Fire), so it consumed a lot of resources. Second, although the app presented a large selection of local radio stations, it was unable to play most of them. The same occurred for international broadcasts.
B00B16WZBE|5.0|I purchased this at the same time I picked up Claptons new set as well as Jimi, Boz and Madeline. I've been playing all the music random to and from work. Man, this album is great. Thanks Eric.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Actually, this app is excellent and it has been very useful for me since I have installed it from the first time. I have my notes, thoughts, ideas, images, my job's info, etc. recorded and organized easily and instantly. But recently, I have had many difficulties synchronizing my info and accessing it offline. It is a pain to try to recover info on the Android version; it takes too long to load. Also, after one the the major updates, the app couldn't access the URL to synch notes, notebooks and other stuff; it did not recognize or accept my password. I had to log out, restart the device, restart the app, and login, only to find out that all the info wasn't there any more. Then, I had to wait some time for the app to retrieve everything again via Wi-Fi from Evernote server. Now, I am scared when I find new update requests, which  are very often now, because I don´t want to go through again for a new process for changing passwords, restarting, synchronizing the WHOLE stuff again, authenticating users, wondering why the app does not work any more, or finding solutions on the Internet. In short, fearing that new updates will mess everything up.
B00BK3MSME|4.0|My reasons for liking various music genres is my business. Anyway, I like the way her music from this set tempers other tunes. She did a nice job on here. I think you'll enjoy it. Just buy it and enjoy.
B000FA675C|5.0|If you want to have fun by reading a catching, interesting and not demanding book, you should read this novel. It is a thriller: it has suspense, occult matters, murder, intrigue, while allowing the reader to feel like the smart scholar who will uncover sacred mysteries.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|My new favorite author.  It started with Gone Girl.  Now I am catching up on all the previous works.  Great character development and a plot that takes you to the end guessing.
B0096A9QXC|2.0|I downloaded the free game for my granddaughter, while she was playing it she was offered another version--for $15, she is only 4 years old and can not read, so i was charged for something I did not order
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Great performance by DDL, but the real &#34;action&#34; in the movie is very limited. nothing really happens and it's really just about the lobying and behind the scenes influencing to buy votes to abandon slavery: which clearly is a historic moment, but nevertheless i expected something more.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|fix this app! it wont let me check my updates and freezes my kindle up! I wish these things would get figured out.
8866130915|5.0|i've been looking for these all over and I finally found it here on Amazon. It's the perfect size for a planner but still has that moleskine feel. I have the Large Sketchbook and I literally throw this planner INSIDE it and elasti-latch the cover.. I can just grab that and go.
1594203334|5.0|Love the book and the insight it has to offer. It's an easy read and really makes you aware of parenting skills.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Why add all sorts of dumb extra details so you can make a movie longer? Is it a funny kids movie with singing dwarves? Is it an over-violent fantasy movie? YES! Peter Jackson was better when he couldn't overreach as much.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|As much fun as you might have with this potentially addictive game, it's more than just a game. It trains you to look more completely for solutions to problems and challenges! So have fun, but don't be surprised if you learn something along the way!
B003B56UNC|2.0|Not so interested in any of these releases now. Would I would love to hear more of is live performances...videon or audio...high quality, if they exist.
1439102813|4.0|so very well written, this book has open my eyes and has enlightening me as to the seriousness of the disease. I would strongly recommend read this book.
B00797MB0O|2.0|I cannot review the whole movie because I turned it off less than 1/4 of the way through.  Wasn't worth watching.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|This video is a third of a story and there is a lot of filler introduced.  Great special effects as usual but, great special effects has become...well, usual.<br /><br />It should be cost less than $20...<br /><br />PS  A time warp has presented us a slightly stouter Frodo cameo.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This is a great movie<br />The quality is crisp and clear<br />I was pretty satisfied with the movie overall<br />Great movie
B009FZFONO|3.0|I've read The Walking Dead Compendium 1 and 2.  This season does not bode as well as the writing and pace of the book.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Last episode had a great pace and what the whole season should have had<br />* Darryl<br />* Carl found his dad's (Rick's) pair lying around because Rick wasn't using them<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Andrea (Her character sucks.  Laurie Holden even said so.)<br />* The pace was terrible<br />* Absence of Robert Kirkman (Now I know why he was asked to leave)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I loved season 1, missed season 2 & now that season 3 started I had to get it to make sense of things. Game of Thrones is great!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|LIKE: This so reminds me of my youth and growing up with arcade and video games.  Superb movie!  Oh and make sure you pause the movie to see the really awesome cut-to-trivia (This is the first time I saw this feature for BluRay movies)<br /><br />Dislike: The product is great but I need to wait a little longer before I expose &#34;Fart-Face&#34; comments to my children's ears.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The best thing on television, Jonny Lee Miller is riveting as Holmes. Lucy Lu as Watson works better than anyone could expect. Well written, occasionally falling into the procedural crime drama genre mid-season the writing rebounds nicely in episode 19
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a very good tool with lots of useful apps that are easy to use. The audible part of it is awesome, I love this. Instead of just reading, you can just lie back and listen to God's word. It was very well thought out in it's  making.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|It's Tarintino - need I saw more, maybet he bloodest Tarintino movie ever. New ways of exploding body bags of blood. Christoph Waltz puts in a great performance
B00AYATBP6|5.0|Awesome!! It arrived in perfect conditions, after one month of waiting to my addrees in Mexico. So glad that I can listen to it now :D
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I've used this cable to connect my iPhone 5 to my computer about once a week since March.  It was always very hard to disconnect the cable from my iPhone.  The white rubber cover would come off the plug.  Yesterday the connector fell apart leaving the pin portion in my iPhone.  I had to use a pair of pliers to get it out.  Today I bought an authentic Apple cable to replace this one.  I do not recommend it.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|I actually read the first novel in this series a while ago, and thought it had some potential. When I recently discovered that there were sequels available, I began to read this installment but only made it about halfway through before just losing interest in it.<br /><br />The reason why?<br /><br />Mostly because the characters weren't very interesting and the plot was too cliche to hold my attention. Not only that, there is supposed to be a supernatural aspect to the story but if there is doesn't really seem to have much bearing on anything. Basically, these sixteen year old high school kids are behaving pretty much like you might expect any typical angst-ridden teens to act with the occasional exception of some strange weather phenomena and a few magically enhanced outbursts.<br /><br />I honestly did feel a little bad for Ethan, but although it is clear that being dumped by Lena will leave its mark on him it didn't stop him from fantasizing about Olivia even before Lena completely cuts him loose. Lena herself was starting to really get on my nerves, I guess because I was holding her to some sort of higher standard since all the casters frequently have a habit of looking down at &#34;lesser&#34; mortals as inferior. To me, that implies that she should be the one putting a supernatural amount of effort into the relationship but instead she seems to hold Ethan's very nature against him, as if it is his fault for not living up to her standards instead of accepting him for who he is (that's what true love is about, after all). Naturally, she finds what she wants elsewhere and even though I was upset with her at first I really can't blame her either.<br /><br />Then again, as I said, teenagers are especially fickle and have a tendency to feel so many emotions very strongly because they have not yet learned how to cope with the stress of adversity in a committed relationship. What it comes down to is that Ethan & Lena were briefly infatuated with each other, but as Lena's grandmother points out,  people do change as they grow whether we like it or not. Unfortunately, these two outgrew each other and no amount of magic will ever change that.
B00A83075M|5.0|I received it a day earlier than expected. Quality is great and my daughter and son love to watch it.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I love Harry Potter so I bought this as soon as it was out but I would suggest buying the ultimate edition which is know out and wasn't when I bought this.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Super entertainer, love her voice. This is a great CD for anyone that likes Katy Perry or pop/rock music. My Grandson has listened to it more than I have.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan, or know one I recommend you collect the entire collection of ultimate editions. I have and I love them all! This one comes with the extended edition as a DVD, which is worth it enough, as well.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the wonderful and vivid imagery. Such a lively, &#34;colorful&#34; world with rich characters and story. The only thing I had to be careful with was watching the timeline in which the story evolved. Other than that, this is a book I will certainly be reading again!

B007FEZQF8|4.0|I never read the comic book prior to watching the show. The comic is great and fills in some of the blanks that I was unaware of by watching the show. Though the comic does not follow the show exactly it makes the whole world of walking dead more enjoyable.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I got this app for free around Christmas time.  And I like it for watching school power points and writing to do lists.  I would not purchase this app for $15 however.  There are too many free services out there that work just as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a . Fun game. I played with my son, 6, he was a little scared,but loved it<br />We stayed up late and its really cool.he got mad when I played by myself. It's a little scary it was weird, very long, good, can't w ait for next one.

B00AF6B1MU|3.0|Vynil 2012 edition: Ok, it's one of the best live albuns ever, but for the price of this reissue, i was expecting to see the beautiful 12&#34; booklet that came with the original 85 release. Also it would be better to use the 180gr virgin black vynil, that has a better audio quality, for this sacred recording.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow! The whole set of \\"Fifty Shades\\" is awesome, well written, sexy, funny keeps you coming back for more!! Cant put the books down! WOW!!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|If you are over 40, you will really appreciate this movie.  It is great.  It has a wonderful cast and the premise is so real, you can relate to it.  My son called me and told me to watch it as it was a wonderful movie.  I reminded him that I was the one that gave it to him!

B0090XJJTQ|5.0|OUTSTANDING as are Most of Robert Downing Projects!!,I ENJOYED his 1st,Just a tad more Than \\"\\"Game Of Shadows\\"\\",But I think that's what A-Lot of Movie Buffs might say About Sequel's. I do want to add,if I had seen more of Rachel McAdams in the sequel. Who Knows<br /><br />  Bah-Da-Bing
B003Y5H574|4.0|Good performances from all in an interesting story exploring the complexities of family and personal relationships. An enjoyable evening's viewing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never really watched network television until this past year when I fired Dish and vowed not to pay huge amounts monthly just to watch TV. I get network shows free and caught a few episodes of the Good Wife. It's what, in its 4th season now? So I decided to see if the earlier seasons were in Prime. And they are. I am almost done with Season 1.<br /><br />Alicia Florrick, played by Julianna Margulies, is the central character. A former stay at home mom who happens to have a current license to practice law in Cook County. &#34;Former: stay at home mom because her husband, Peter, played by Chris Noth, is a former Cook COunty state's attorney, is in prison for corruption. This alone got me interested because I lived in Chicagoland for most of my life and keep current on Chicago/Illinois politics. So, this plot is reality TV so far. It wasn't just corruption, though, but a juicy sex scandal.<br /><br />Alicia is forced to sell the huge house in the suburbs. Not sure where, but I envision Highland Park in my head. She rents a two-bedroom apartment. It's a very nice apartment and has a maid's room, so it's probably in the city or at least in an older area, because, really, what apartments have maid's rooms? Anyway, Alicia manages to get hired on as a junior associate at a prestigious law firm. One of the managing partners is her law-school classmate, Wil Gardner. He's a hottie and single. And he has an eye for Alicia. And vice versa. Ah, some sexual tension.<br /><br />Alicia, for all her rustiness at practicing law, is a great lawyer. She has incredible common sense, attention to detail, and a whole lot of Chicago connections, that make her super-lawyer/private investigator all in one. Oh, and she wears skirt suits and heels all the time. Well, most of the time.<br /><br />Peter is angling for release from prison. He wants to make up with Alicia. He seems to think this will happen. A few $3,000 hookers here and there is no biggie, I suppose. Alicia is still ticked at him. Duh. So, even if Peter gets out of prison, will he have a sweet little good wife to come home to?<br /><br />Add in an officious but well-meaning mother-in-law, two teenage kids, a supporting cast with depth in characters, and you've got something for everyone!<br /><br />This reminds me of LA Law somewhat except that each episode builds on the last and it could be confusing to just watch them individually. It's a soap. Great photography (but not filmed in Chicago, supposedly), superior dialogue. This show's got me hooked. .m. Duh.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed Season 2 so much that I set aside time for a DA marathon.  Best entertainment ever and can't want to find ot what happens in Season 3.
B003E6FCJG|3.0|you know in season one ellen is the hard working honest character<br />in the series the further you get into season two you start to feel<br />none of the characters have any redeeming qualities and start to<br />wonder if it is worth continuing to watch.
B001JV5BIA|4.0|This was an old favorite coming up; however when you look @ the content makes you wonder, times really hasn't changed!!!!
