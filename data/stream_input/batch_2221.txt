0142501123|5.0|We received this book from Grandma for my daughter's first Halloween.  Wow, did it quickly become my favorite children's book (even beating out my previous, untouchable favorites from my own childhood!).  It is a lovely story of a sweet witch who helps out new friends without hesitation.  Her kindness pays off when in the end, her friends come to save her and repay the kindness she had shown them.  This book turned me on to Julia Donaldson as my favorite children's book author, where we have discovered many new favorite stories to share.  You will always find an underlying theme of friendship and giving in all of her books, but these sentiments don't beat you over the head with this message as other books sometimes can.  My daughter is now almost 4 and we have many Donaldson books in our collection, each loved by young and old alike.  You cannot go wrong with this book!
B009VB97EY|3.0|As I've been told, Not supposed to watch this movie for the plot but seriously? It just...Ended? Hate movies that do that! However, Mr. Tatum has some moves that please the eye!
B004WJV6OY|5.0|I bought this for my husband (huge Eddie Vedder fan) and he loves it!  This is probably his favorite video.  It's pretty awesome!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|If you've read all the books, which I have, it's disappointing that certain parts of the book get skipped/changed in the show. HOWEVER, that aside, it's a continuation of the first season's excellent work. I watched all ten episodes in a day and a half. I highly recommend this.
B0047C2IIE|4.0|I had this album in vinyl and wanted the same music on CD, but alas, it's not the same.  But, I still enjoy Bing during the holidays.  I wish I could find the vinyl version on CD.  It included a variety of other performers on it that I would love to have on CD.
B00B2QA9TI|2.0|I don't watch a movie to watch a play. That's what this movie was. It was a play that they filmed, basically. It was hard to follow, boring (YAWN) and I was really disappointed because I wanted it to be so much more.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|kind of slow and repetative.  not sure what all the fuss is about.  i wish my stickman could walk faster.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Don't worry, NO SPOILER ALERT needed. Let's just say this season was a continuation of the first two's excellence. The story kept going and it even touched on some very sensitive material that we are dealing with here in the modern day as well. And OH THE ENDING, OH THE HORROR...lol...let's just say I cannot wait till Season 4.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have discovered a glich with the home screen picture instead of the normal picture with the temple face with a 2 in the bottom right corner it's some weird film playing thing! PLEASE FIX!!!!
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I don't know how in the world they got funding to make this movie. It was just plain old terrible. The story was boring. The filming substandard. It was repetitive, confusing, and i hated it. I think this is either the first or second worst movie I have ever seen. I didn't even finish it. Later, I went back to try and watch some more and again, I stopped watching. PLEASE do yourself a favor and save some money by not buying or renting this horrible film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so cool.  I want to know when it is the next time they upgrade it.  I hope soon they make fire and lava in it some time for kindle fire.  it would be so cool.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Pros<br />-Delivery was ahead of time. Came within 3 days after ordering, and expected delivery was a week later.<br />-70C decrease in CPU temp!<br /><br />Just installed the CPU replacing my old liquid cooler, bringing down the ridiculous temperature of 90C to 20C!!! 70C decrease! With lower temps on the MOBO, it also brought down my GPU temp from 60C to 40C! The best $25 I have invested for cooling!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game and easy to play when Im just wasting time. Works well on my Kindle Fire. I havent been playing it long, but I enjoy it. No glitches yet.
015206396X|5.0|This was a fantastic start to the series! Katsa's story is so riveting right from the beginning that I found it hard to stop reading. She was easy to relate to even though she had a completely different perception on life than I do the author did an amazing job of having me know exactly where she was coming from. I loved Po's attitude and even though I couldn't see his eyes for real I was ensnared by them all the same. His personality and joy shown through the narrative and captured my heart. My absolutely favorite character in this book had to be Bitterblue. For such a young kid she was extremely perceptive and knew exactly what was going on around her. I am extremely excited to continue on to the next book and find what other amazing characters await.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I got as far as Anna's room and the back button was directly in front of the 4th crayon I needed. Nothing helped and I couldn't get past that level. Spent $2.99 on this and can't play it.
0385737947|3.0|This was a book that I couldn't wait to read and was so excited when I got it. I don't know maybe my enthusiasm kind of threw me off when I was reading it but it didn't live up to my full expectations. The story as a whole is extremely interesting but as with the main character, Thomas, I felt frustrated and held back with the complete lack of answers I was getting. The majority of characters the story revolves around are male; it was a refreshing concept with most young adult series being female focused. I am excited to get to read the second book in the series and see if a little bit more about the concept is revealed.
0440243688|5.0|My Husband really likes all his books & great to get them for a good price. Just a good place to shop, with you.
B000003R7G|5.0|Gotta love portishead. This has always been one of my favorite albums to dim the lights, roll a j, and just chill to
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it....Can't wait till the movie comes out....just hope it doesn't stray from the book in any way. As they the fun is getting there....
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think you should make a new book for Percy Jackson called the Titans revenge about how Kronos test to take over again from Brady your biggest fan
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Would love to read more of his point of view....was hoping it would go to the hold on the street...
B004UID2LC|3.0|It is hard to find things in. I can't figure out how to subscribe to my channels. I use the apple app on my I phone and maybe I am spoiled. it's just easier to search and find things.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|This does not live up to its hype.  Just about all of the material has been released in different albums with perhaps editing on it.<br /><br />I prefer the instrumentals on this to the vocals.  Many of Jimi's vocals appear as if he is making up the words as he is singing it, and unfortunately it's very obvious that he was doing this, skatting.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I think Jimi was among the top poets of his age, Axis Bold As Love's LP proves it.  He's right up there with his idol, Bob Dylan.<br /><br />The guitar work is naturally great, but doesn't really show anything new.<br /><br />I don't recommend buying this.  Personally I think this is just another vehicle for Janie Hendrix (who hardly knew him since she was just a little girl when he was alive), to gain more income.  In short....don't waste your money buying this.<br /><br />If you want something of quality outside of his first three albums, buy the Live Withdrawn CD.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|okay but u only get like fifteen minutes for it. so I started like three different games trying to get the basics.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am a Jack Reacher fan but now I am also a John Puller fan. They're both great.<br />They're both my heros. Looking forward so much to the next Puller book. Zero Day is a book that you can't put down.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Another great game from Alawar.  Worth every penny, all 99 of them!  This is a typical HO adventure game.  Engaging storyline, challenging enough to be fun not frustrating.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Couldn't find this anywhere locally so I bought it on the Kindle because everyone was talking about it. Couldn't put it down and ended up reading all 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really lucked up when I found this calculator.  Works great on my Kindle Fire and big numbers are a real plus.
B0086700CM|1.0|Daughter downloaded this to my Kindle telling me it was &#34;soooo much fun&#34;, she lied. I hated it. Very boring
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I went to see the movie the first time in 2D and was very impressed at Ang Lee's vision. There were a few changes from the book and one notable scene left out of the movie. However, the movie held its own and truly is a memorable work of art.<br /><br />Two weeks later I decided to go see the movie again, but this time in 3D. It was a completely different experience. I felt like I was sitting through an entirely different story. I have to admit, I didn't think this was a movie worth the extra $4 for the 3D ticket as it was not your fast action, fast paced action flick. I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />I am buying the 3D Blu-Ray even though I do not yet own a player capable of 3D so that I will have it when the right equipment is finally purchased. I will watch this one over and over. BTW, I have read the book two more times since seeing the movie the second time. I so believe there is a God. Which story do you believe?
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's good for when Facebook is down and you can't get into the actual game. I play it when I'm bored.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The trilogy was not as riveting nor as sexually daring or alarming as indicated by the media.  The plot is more gradual and indicative of a novel being that the main focus is upon the character Christian's development.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app caused me to lose track of my whole weekend! It's a great way to find new recipes, crafts for kids and just about anything else you could possibly think of.<br />I keep a notebook next to me when I go on just to write all the cool stuff down!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, really addicting, and fast paced! Not like your usual matching game like Bejeweled.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Need to know today's weather? Just check this app and you'll have updated and accurate informtion! Offers real-time plus hourly, 36-hour and 10-day forecast.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Series 1 ,2 and Christmas DVD.  Would recommend them to everyone.  Still have to view Series 3 but sure I will enjoy it as muchas the others.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a spin on minecraft pe but more in-deph. It has several awesome features like animal spawners cars flying and more. I spend hours playing this it is worth the money!
B000EHSVOG|5.0|I love all the stars in this movie it was a big hit.  I just decided that I was tired of waiting to have it come on TV so I got my own copy.  Definitely worth it!!!!
B00000G3AZ|2.0|emma is one of my favorite movies , but this dvd is not clear it is blurry like a video vhs tape maybe a copy was put in this dvd case.plastic was loose on it.
B00A757EFW|5.0|i had a great buying experiance with this company it arrived on time and they are very good i would recomend them to everyone i know
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I just really like this man's poetry. This is a good album with 2 discs, covering most of his best work. Like Dylan, you buy and listen to his stuff because of the content, not voice-yet, the performance wouldn't be same in a different voice, either. I think its because its all theirs.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|i had a great buying experiance with this company it arrived on time and they are very good i would recomend them to everyone i know
B0041IODF0|5.0|I was happy to find a single issue of the series. I have two sets of this wonderful series-one of my own and one to loan, but one of the books met up with an accident. These are good books for any child to read.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|i had a great buying experiance with this company it arrived on time and they are very good i would recomend them to everyone i know
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutely love Lindsey Stirling's music. It's what gets me up in the morning, makes my day happy, and I just can't get enough! I bought her CD just before Christmas, and have been listening to it every day since. It's just that kind of awesome.
B00007J5VN|2.0|The movie is great. But about half way thru the DVD started skipping and I had to shut it down. I havent tried to send it back for a replacement yet. Would love to see it all the way thru.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Wanted&#34; is a mile-a-second action picture that never lets up. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) suddenly finds that his life as an ordinary office worker is over. A beautiful woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), crashes into his life and introduces him to the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins led by the mysterious Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Wesley is informed that his long-lost father was murdered while working for the Fraternity and Wes has been chosen to target the rogue member who did it. Before he can complete his assignment, he must first uncover the dark secrets behind the Fraternity to understand why he was selected and how he figures in its plans.<br /><br />This was a blind buy for me! I'm surprised at the number of poor reviews for this film. I have to admit that I picked it up with limited expectations, but once into it, I found it to be a bloody, irresistible ride---for what it is, that is.<br /><br />This film was spectacular in Blu-ray, appearing almost 3-D, at times. The CGI and audio were equally adrenaline pumping and, although I'm not usually into blood-fest, action films, this one became addictive.<br /><br />Yeah, the plot was limited, but I found a great deal of enjoyment watching James McAvoy morph from a passive, introverted, office cube-jockey, into a man. One who learned to stop saying, 'I'm sorry,' for just about everything. I did find myself mentally repeating, 'wax on, wax off,' during some of his lethality training, with difficulty taking his transformation seriously.<br /><br />So, if you view this movie with casual expectations and are willing to allow yourself the enjoyment of pure escapism and bloody mayhem, I think you will enjoy this movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny, Romantic, sexy and well written. I hate standard romance - this is not. Its modern with a take on Womens rights. As such it rings a bell with every liberated literal women. Enjoyed from page one to the end and was sorry to finish it. I hope to see alot more books from Mira.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I'd admit that I was a little skeptic buying this, but a friend promised I'd love it. And what do you know? I LOVE IT!! Incredible way of mixing modern life with classical mythology. I love movies about classical mythology and this one was AWESOME!! I highly recommend it!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|An escape from the real world. A story filled with intrigue, colorful characters, a modern day quest and a good reason to go to bed late at night.
6305558167|4.0|i have seen this at the theater when it was released in its time and was enchanted ever since! the Merlin was mystical as well as powerful!and the music was and still is as epic as the day it was composed by the geniuse's hand for which it came from.i urge any collector of dvd to grab this historical gem before the day its manufacturer of the dvd says \\"no more to be made\\"from this day forth.but be warned once that day has come,your failure will be completed when your purchase was not taken into consideration for all time keepsake.
0440246008|5.0|Another fun read in the Jack Reacher series, our hero gets involved in a kidnapping. With the usual twists and turns, nothing is really as it seems.<br /><br />In this one, the author makes use of Reacher's quirk of always knowing exactly what time it is. I found that an amusing trait and liked the way the author used it throughout the story. With a much better sense for who Jack is after reading several novels, I was able to sit back and relax and enjoy the story more.<br /><br />The author's writing style is quick and to the point, however, he likes to get very passive in certain chunks of his prose. While that is a huge no-no for new writers, seeing as how Lee is an established presence, he can get away with it with no consequence, and apparently from his huge popularity, none of his readers seem to mind. As a reader, I find it annoying at times, but nothing that stops me from reading. However, at times, with this story as with others, I found myself drifting into counting \\"was\\" words per paragraph which was a bit distracting. That was my only real beef with this novel.<br /><br />As usual, though I liked the ending and everything resolved to my satisfaction, the one quirk was that Jack just disappeared with no explanation which seems to be a trademark of this series.<br /><br />An enjoyable novel. Highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the large display and it does everything I need it for.pretty cool to have on my tablet.Thanks for developing this app for folks like me that can't do math
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Great show, great music, and its for a great cause.  This is a piece of history and a lot of fun to watch and listen to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an app that will keep you on your toes. Unless your device decides to be unresponsive then you go splat into a train. This game will give you hours of enjoyment. Download it now.
0879309210|5.0|What a great source of information! I really really enjoyed this book and will all way use it! I actually think the author of this book might be one of the best teachers to actually explain this process for everyone!
B009JZTOG8|3.0|Season One was fine.  There was a lot to learn about the characters, their back story, and the discovery process was interesting and fun.  In Season Two everything has slowed down and turned into a Soap Opera.  I find myself losing interest in the stories and characters.
0634049011|5.0|A great Teaching tool to fully understand the guitar and the fretboard! I am so happy I bought this that I bought TWO!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This album is incredible! Bruno Mars is such an amazing artist and I hope he never stops making music! The album transcends genres and his talent amazes me. He sings everything with such emotion and passion. This is what great music is about :)
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig does a wonderful job playing the role of James Bond. This latest in the 50 yr history of Mr. Bond's adventures, is a must see movie!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Great movie, great price. I really don't think I need to say anything more. I definitely recommend people buy it and enjoy the movie!!
1616550414|5.0|That book is THE book that every Zelda fan should get.<br />That's the bible :) You'll get every piece of information on the serie, the games, the characters, the creator, etc.<br />The book is actually really big and heavy and quality is pretty good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Keeps your interest, many twists & turns. I found the ending did not live up to the hype; good beach read.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Really funny.  Some parts were a little stupid, but whatever.  Great acting though.  Really good actors.  I even took notice of the special effects.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Love it and have loved everything I have read by him. Story lines are great and just enough humor to make characters more human and enjoyable.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I have to say that the best thing about this movie for me was Sam Worthington.  I'm just being honest.  I'm a huge fan.  The action rocked.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Classic book had to read it in school and have read it several times since then. Required reading in my household for all my children and grandchildren.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I've always been a fan of this movie, so I finally treated myself to the dvd.  Everyone should get something out of this movie.  It has funny stuff for kids and adults.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Very predictable---no where near as good as &#34;The Notebook&#34;. Did not care for the whole side line of the dead wife<br />guiding her. Also no real mystery of what she was hiding from nor whom.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This is an amazing series.  Everyone I've shown it to loves it - male, female, young, old...it's got a great story, isn't written to placate typical feel-good TV audiences, and is difficult to watch just one episode in a sitting.  When my brother told me I HAD to watch this, I was expecting more of an action-packed, hack and slash type show.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of it wasn't some sort of Braveheart knockoff.<br /><br />I have some shelves I keep all my collector's edition blu-rays on and the collector's edition I purchased looks fantastic there.  The egg it comes with is a bit lackluster, but if you really like this series, it might be worth looking at this edition.<br /><br />Also - the inclusion of digital copies is fantastic and makes buying this series an amazing deal. I prefer to watch the blu-rays on my big TV, but am super glad I can watch them on my TV in my bedroom through my Apple TV or bring an espisode or two with me to watch on my iPad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think people should try this game because it's fun and cool. It has all these different characters and surf boards that you can choose from.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I am not an Idol fan, but love this album! His voice has such an intoxicating sound! I highly recammend it!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This one is just as charming and interesting as P&P which is a favorite.  I am still reading this one but so far, so good.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Just about anything by Kelly Clarkson is good. Nothing more to be said, haven't finished listening to it. &#34;Stronger&#34; is my favorite.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Everyone in the United States and the Western world should read this book.  It is well written with much thought provoking information from a woman who knows first hand what she is writing about.
B0067R0APK|2.0|The sign sale stays on it. I don't see any difference from the free app. I put the free one on the home page, the paid one looks stupid with the sale sign.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|But the contract was so much easier to read.  Apparently Amazon can't afford any real writers for their own materials.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is the series I waited for since the end of &#34;24&#34; Doesn't try to simplyfy the subject. Entertains at the same time. The actors are perfect in their roles.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I honestly can't get enough of this book. I have read it countless times since I bought it last May.  I of course had to re-read it again to prepare for Walking Disaster.  Gotta love Travis!  After reading Beautiful Disaster, I went and purchased Jamie McGuire's Providence series.  I'm not usually a fan of demons & angels books but I loved them.  She's a great author but Beautiful Disaster with Travis Maddox is by far my favorite book! A must read... Over and over again!!!
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I loved the songs and the acting in this movie. it gives me a lift when iam down in the dumps
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is asome u can get hover boards, power ups and so much more u need to get this game its addictive
B009IF8CH6|5.0|what can be bad about this show. I love having it on my Kindle. It always makes me laugh and feel better
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|I tried to scale back my expectations after reading all the five star reviews and having this band come highly recommended. I really, really wanted to love this CD but unfortunately it did not impress throughout. I will say that I liked about half of the songs with the the first 4 and Colossal being the best. I like the sound they are trying to create but it left me wondering \\"what could have been?\\" Many of these songs are severly lacking in guitar and don't have a good flow to them. I found Apple Tree to be downright terrible but I'm not a White Stripes fan either. It's almost humorous how many infulences you can hear when listening to these songs and I can't recall another band like that for quite some time. There is one song that sound EXACTLY like David Bowie..i mean IDENTICAL. Overall there are some solid rockers but I sort of came away from it empty as this band in NO WAY lives up to the greats of Sabbath, Zeppelin, and other 70's power houses. Believe it or not I just listened to this for the first time yesterday and had never even heard of the band!!! Yes, that sums up what I think of \\"new\\" rock music these days....
1614270198|5.0|This is one of the best books written giving information on how to use the tools you are equipped with to lead a fruitful life.<br />For the people who believe in God, the book explains that you are provided with God-given abilities to to enjoy and progress in life.<br />This is a book that can easily replace the Bible or any other religious scriptures.<br />I have been reading this book for 20 yrs now and it rests by my bedhead, so that I can read passages from it to remind me of what I must do.<br />I strongly recommend the ideas put forward in this book to the weak minded and failures in life.<br />It is a book that will reinforce your belief in your particular religion, however, the book does not teach you to rely on God's will but on your will.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Been playing it for days havnt fount anything wrong. Great game and would definitely recommend for people to try it out
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Opening a present is like opening your mind to new thoughts and ideas there's always a surprise! Try it sometime.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|More of everything I loved about the first! If you liked the original release you can't go wrong buying this extended version of the movie.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Really engaging read...I bought it when home down and out with a cold, and it was good company. Made my alone time enjoyable and the time passed very quickly. Really liked all of the characters and have strongly recommend this book to many friends who are very well read and enjoy a good page turner.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This version of Total Recall and the original are overall different movies with only the core elements remaining the same. This is a better action movie then the first and has more realistic vibe to it's plot based on using political agendas as the motivation as opposed to the originals gang of martian mutants vs. developer tycoon. Also I like the cast better the acting is better and the female characters are a lot better. If you sat someone down who likes action sci-fi and they had never seen either version of this movie chances are they will prefer this movie over the original. Where the original got a little cheesy with it's characters this version does not which is a big plus in my book.
B000002H6C|5.0|AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is one of the real true METAL MASTERPIECES of all time....it comes from a period when METALLICA was the king of the METAL world( IRON MAIDEN ruled this world too)...it´s before the BLACK album...before Nothing else matters...it´s from a period when METALLICA was raw, punk METAL attitude with really meaningful lyrics....maybe the coolest band from the late 80´s....well, all the songs are amazing THRASH gens like BLACKENED, HARVESTER OF SORROW, SHORTEST STRAW, ONE, EYE OF THE BEHOLDER and the title track....AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is a METAL classic, and the last really RAW THRASH album from the legendary METALLICA!!!!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|i cant imagine what she has been through but reading her story and how she sees life is very good after all that she endured for all those years. makes you cry.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|yes, is true!!!! this is the best THRASH METAL album of all time!!!!! METALLICA may got some real classics, but REIGN IN BLOOD is like a fast relentless, BRUTAL and hallucinated trip through the realms of the agressive THRASH world!!!!! and it all comes so quickly...All the songs are METAL gens!!!! REIGN IN BLOOD is the main reason for the SLAYER domination.....SEASONS IN THE ABYSS is AMAZING, but REIGN IN BLOOD rules!!!!!! HAIL SLAYER, masters of the THRASH METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love this game! it is one of the best games that I ever played! I love this game so so so very much
B000001ES9|5.0|RUSH´s debut is a great collection of HEAVY ROCK songs from a really young band trying to find their own sound.....There´s some clear influences from LED ZEPPELIN and BLACK SABBATH on tunes like FINDING MY WAY and WORKING MAN....but after many spins, i can say i really like RUSH´s debut....All the songs are nice like NEED SOME LOVE and WHAT YOU´RE DOING...Future masterpieces like 2112 and HEMISPHERES may be better, but this young RUSH is really cool!!!!
B000067QMD|1.0|These were a waste of money as they did not fit my bottles properly and the bottles did not seal and leaked.  I threw them away.
B000000H5K|5.0|man, i remenber when ROOTS came to the world....i think SEPULTURA and PANTERA were the big 2 of the metal world in the mid 90´s...this will forever be the CLASSIC FROM THE JUNGLE!!!! The SEPULTURA album of the indian on the front cover!!!!! all the songs are BRUTAL and AMAZING!!!!! sadly, Max left the band after ROOTS.....i put ROOTS on the same level of past masterpieces like ARISE and CHAOS.....WELL DONE, SEPULTURA!!!!!!! ROOTS BLOODY ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTSSSSSS!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it is the best game ever. I haven't been playing for long but I deft fell in love with this game
B000089RV6|5.0|well, if you like ROCK N roll, BACK IN BLACK is totally recommended for you!!!!

160309007X|2.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen really deserved a better finale than this. Fan's will feel that they HAVE to purchase the last (I assume) in the series just to have the complete set, but seriously, don't bother. It's completely vapid. Maybe this is some sort of symbolic FU to the modern age. Kind of like a later Sex Pistols concert - the joke is on you, the consumer. The 2 stars was out of sheer loyalty to Alan Moore and his incredible body of work. Maybe the old guy has lost it. The whole thing just smacks either of lack of inspiration or lack of effort. Not to worry. The man has a huge backlog of works of sheer genius that I can draw on for comfort.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle never fails to deliver! Her renditions of songs are original and refreshing! There isn't one song on this album that I don't love. There are old favorites like 'Memory' from Cats and 'Send in the Clowns' and new favorites like 'Winner Takes It All'. The duets with Donny Osmond and Michael Crawford are wonderful. I also love her personal notes of her feelings on each song. Thank you Susan Boyle for having the courage to step out. You have made my life a little more enjoyable.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Loved all the other movies,this one was great also & I would recommend it to my friends & family. Thanks Cinder

0765350386|1.0|I know I'm one of very few not to like but I became so disgusted with it that I gave up on it a little more than half way through. If you are even somewhat critical as a reader, give this one a miss because the glaring faults in the plot will drive you nuts.<br /><br />Okay, Allomancy as an explanation for super-powers is new as a concept but so what? It turns the cast of very paper-cut out characters into the typical super heroes with one special magic trick or, rarely, into the super-super special hero with all the abilities roled into one stomach lining. The novel was also trying to be a slick super-crime such as Oceans 11's in its plot but obviously Sanderson doesn't have much insight into the sort of brilliance required for the supreme criminal mind nor much knowledge of the intelligence methods used by a totalitarian government. The meetings of the supposedly super-thieves were as dull as dishwater to read, a gloss-over of basic facts and illustrative of such shallow thinking that I was as bored as if it was a meeting with a low-level accountant. The conversations were as completely uninspired as the characters, their \\"plotting\\" so empty of sophistication or subtlety, and so full of holes, that I was unconvinced that these guys were really as slick as they were described; it certainly wasn't demonstrated.<br /><br />Then the actual action had them doing things that even the most amateur of subversive criminals would never consider. One of my pet peeves, Sanderson either doesn't think about what the \\"opposing\\" forces might be doing in reaction or he succumbed to the \\"stupid enemy\\" contrivance. For example, the entire core of the elite team visit together the site of a hit by the dread Inquisitors, a place that was hit because they'd met there or because Vin, now a part of the team, had lived there; and they all show up to expose themselves in a world where, supposedly, everyone will rat out everyone else at the drop of a dime! But, not to fear, the totalitarian regime that made the hit has neglected to stake it out to watch who turned up to check out the mess afterward! And none of the crowd of spectators actually informs on them, either. It was juvenile mistake and I couldn't help but think that, trying to write this sort of plot, Sanderson was completely out of his depth. He should at least have read a few espionage and crime novels and gotten a clue before trying to write one himself. This team wouldn't have lasted five minutes in fiction, never mind real life...<br /><br />But I suspended my disbelief and soldiered on, getting increasingly sick of Vin's adolescent stubbornness and street-wise attitude, fighting her innate goodness with negative messages about not trusting anyone. The messages in this book were all as flat and heavy-handed as the characters were flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />The dread Inquisitors seriously, almost fatally wound Vin, a young female mistborn that they are now known to be hunting. She has now been identified as working with Kelsier, seen in his company within the inner-sanctum of the great central palace and nearly killed in that \\"hit\\". And then the (so we are told) super smart, super-sophisticated master-criminals and conspirators just say that Vin's cover persona, the young, female debutante of the matching description that has recently appeared among the nobility (where all the mistborn are supposed to come from) and that no one has ever heard of and whose credentials would be trashed in even the most cursory of checks, gee, they just say she's really sick and can't attend any more balls. But the dreaded Ministry and Inquisitors don't put 2 and 2 together so that's okay. Must be the red sun and all the ashes in the air clogging up the thinking of the entire upper echelon of this society.<br /><br />Vin at this point lost all potential appeal as even the too typical physically abused young girl with innate superpowers yet undiscovered (formerly abused and controlled by her brother--where have I seen that before?) when she started sighing over decisions about her ball gowns while recuperating, ever so anxious to get back to a ball (though she doesn't dance)! Maybe all teenage girls are supposed to be so silly and so quickly seduced by such finery but the discussions of her mental processes soon became not only tedious but odious--and so trite! And if that wasn't bad enough, now add Regency Teen Romance to a very amateur attempt to produce something sophisticated in the Crime of the Century Genre and if the thought gives you a nervous twitch, spare yourself.<br /><br />In a serious \\"heist\\" story, Vin's \\"cover\\" should have been abandoned the minute the Inquisitors got a look at her at a crime scene, never mind stabbed her, marking her pretty effectively; they are supposed to be almost invincible. If they were trying to preseve the cover, they ought to have used something else to explain her down-time, an emergency trip home to visit a dying aunt or something! But, not to worry, the Inquisitors of a totalitarian regime would never have such a tight eye on the nobility, I guess.<br /><br />And then, only partially recovered from her gut-wound, mysteriously absent for weeks while ill, off she goes to another ball, selecting for herself a bright notice-me scarlet dress, even though she's just supposed to be sliding around on the fringes of society, unnoticed, so that she can inconspicuously eavesdrop on conversations. And no one thinks to check this stupid fifteen-year old's choice of attire beforehand, not even her super-sophisticated Terrisman mage tutor who accompanies her out the door. Once there, she ogles the other women's high heel shoes and want some for herself (gag me with an overlong novel!). And only when seated among the people she's supposed to be spying on does she ask her advisor/escort what she's supposed to be listening for exactly. Where they can be overheard themselves, presumably. And then begins the most typical, nauseating teen romance stuff that I have ever been unfortunate enough to have under my eyeballs.<br /><br />I quit right there, totally turned off to this whole ridiculous, juvenile-level writing exercise. So uninspired was the writing that I began to wonder if one of Sanderson's students actually wrote it. I sort of hope so!<br /><br />This book is now in my category of \\"Just Too Stupid To Endure\\". Unfortunately, I wasn't even curious enough any longer to get the the end, which most other reviews said was \\"satisfying\\". It would have to be a heck of a lot more than that to make the rest even bearable for me. The half I did suffer through was a disappointing waste of my time.-where have I seen that before?) when she started sighing over decisions about her ball gowns while recuperating, ever so anxious to get back to a ball (though she doesn't dance)!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Im the casual Jimi Hendrix fan. With that being said, I enjoyed this cd very much. Don't be frightened away by the reviewers and haters that are giving 1&2 star reviews.There is some superb guitar work done in this music and I for one am glad the estate chose to share these renditions with us fans that enjoy his music.Maybe they are not perfect studio cuts, but the music on this cd is far better that most of the crap released in music today........support your favorite artists.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I was quite pleased with the story line, actors and actresses.  Everyone was in top form.  However, even though the drama keeps the viewer spellbound, it is such a sad story.  I do not know how the story will end, but somehow, I hope the Damian Lewis character can be salvaged.  I still think of him as the hero in &#34;Band of Brothers.&#34;

B00AJRKR3Y|3.0|Steve Lukather's new CD has some stellar moments but I can live w/o the pop ballads with the 80s vibe. That being said,I love Creep Motel and the opener, Judgement Day. Just wish his penchant for production was just a bit toned down.

0062014536|4.0|Writing this review means that I have to give this book a rating. I've been torn about it since I finished it a day ago and I knew it was somewhere between a 3 and a 5-star review but there were SO MANY THINGS I FELT. I ended up just going for four stars because I didn't know what else to do, to be honest. There were a lot of things said before this came out by a lot of people I trust but I ignored them mostly because, when other people have strong feelings about things, I don't necessarily feel the same way. In fact, I usually don't feel the same way at all. Either way, I think I liked it more than most but I was a little disappointed for personal reasons and less about the story itself. It was nice, but not what I wanted.<br /><br />So let's start off with what's good about the book. Hana's back! Similar to how Pandemonium is split up, Requiem jumps between Lena and Hana's points of view. At first I was nervous because I haven't read any of Oliver's novellas so I wasn't sure I would be able to follow/enjoy Hana's point of view, but I did! Hana is still in Portland so we get to see things from the inside even though Lena is fully removed from society now. And Hana has been cured, but it hasn't necessarily been working how it was supposed to -- she remembers Lena and her family, misses running and has all kinds of crazy dreams.<br />I don't want to spoil anything too much but obviously Lena and her posse don't sit on their laurels after regrouping outside of New York. They trek through a bunch of different places, trying to help the Resistance in any way they can. There are some great scenes where Lena has to make some tough decisions regarding various things -- life and love included. It's not an easy trip for anyone involved, but it's an interesting read. I'm trying so hard not to spoil A SINGLE THING for anyone but there's so much stuff that happens and it's all so good. It really is.<br /><br />So it's really good until the last ten pages. The worst part? You don't know even know they're the last ten pages either, because the tricky people at Harper Collins included an excerpt of Before I Fall at the end so you think there's more left in the book than there actually is! I think that's what threw me more than anything else. Had I known that I was approaching the end, I might have been better prepared for everything. But I wasn't! I was expecting 30 more pages or so and I got ten! And I liked about seven of the ten. The ones that I didn't like were a strange Hana chapter that didn't make sense to me. The chapter before that featuring her, would've been a good ending point for Hana but Lauren Oliver added on this strange chapter that made Hana seem crazy. At least to me.<br />The other pages that I didn't mind were just completely open-ended. I can understand Oliver's need to leave it like that -- I'm fairly certain I would end my own story that way -- but at the same time, I selfishly wanted some resolution. There wasn't any resolution with the characters or the plot. There sort of was for a few, but not fully, which didn't really help the situation. So 95% of the novel was fabulous and I was giddy as a school girl reading it. But the end just brought me down. If you're prepared, I think you might not have such a hard time as I had, but maybe you're just a selfish as me and you will.n't know even know they're the last ten pages either, because the tricky people at Harper Collins included an excerpt of Before I Fall at the end so you think there's more left in the book than there actually is!

1423151054|4.0|I gave this product a 4 because the price was just right at the time I bought it! I think there might have been a promotional time - but the price was around $35 when I purchased. I know a lot of people had been waiting for these to buy from Amazon, but one lucky day I just looked and it was on sale and in stock.<br /><br />This gift was for my boyfriend, who's an animator. He was overjoyed! He absolutely loves them and looks at them for inspiration. They're on his desk at work for everyone to see. Other animators come over and ogle at them too. I gave them to him one per day. It was a great way to give him some inspiration and look forward to going to work and working.<br /><br />One thing I didn't really like was the lid seemed a little weak... It bent at one point and I had to straighten it back together. However, overall I would definitely recommend this as a gift!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This was absolutely the most beautiful,moving,funny,gut wrenching,astounding,...the words could go to time indefinite...I have never seen any movie that was so incredibly filmed which such beauty,the pools of fish life,the storm  with the water that became a living thing as it churned  tossed Pi and Charles Parker .  .  . The transition both went through.The complete look of fear on Charles Parker' s face as he clung to the boat.The establishment of . territory and the laugh out loud that was  ME .The  sadness ,yes, I CRIED,,big tears.. I will watch this movie  over and  I am  positive that I will have the same semse  of wonder.....just  astounding and incredibly<br />  Beautiful experience
B00B31DT5I|3.0|When it has came down to Michael Bolton, musically he has been one of the best crooners to have ever came out of the 80's. His songs have definitely been a benchmark for his career. But his songs lately haven't been able to shine like they used to do. He has done well with his comical side in commercials for Optimum cable service, and a parody about Captain Sparrow from Pirates Of The Caribbean. But other than that, he is definitely not the mega-singer he had shown in his past. The past several years, Michael has mainly brought out less than striking songs that just don't show he is that star he was in the 80's and 90's. He has done cover songs before in his work, which have brought him massive acclaim, but not his latest project just doesn't feel like it has enough to sparkle and shine, the way he did before. In fact, it feels like something done by another Michael 10 years ago.<br /><br />Ain't No Mountain High Enough: Tribute To Hitsville, U.S.A., is a tribute to the classic music of the Motown music era. While it does showcase Michael at some of his highs, the problem is that it is too short of tributing classic songs, and feels like it is too little. The songs show some of his best covers though in years, from his cover of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, and a cover of Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing with Melanie Fiona who does a decent Tammi delivery. Some of the other covers work fairly well, like How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You.) The big problem with this album is that is too short, and more classics could've been added to the album. He has done Marvin Gaye before, by covering Sexual Healing back in 1999, but there could've been a bit more variety here. Michael could've picked more by doing a better variety of songs like Uptight and Mercy, Mercy Me to just name a few songs that could've been on the album.<br /><br />The problem with Ain't No Mountain High Enough: A Tribute To Hitsville U.S.A., is that it falls a bit short as a must buy for die hard Michael Bolton fans, and newcomers to his voice as well. It could've had more of the classic covers to match in this album, but they weren't here. Also, it doesn't match in the simplicity of soul covers that have shown in recent albums like Phil Collins' Going Back, and it is nowhere near Michael McDonald's classic Motown album which had more to offer. If you are new to Michael Bolton's music, I would definitely pass this album up, and go back to his classics. If you are die hard Michael Bolton fan, you may consider passing this up as well.<br /><br />Album Cover: C+<br /><br />Songs: C-<br /><br />Price: D+<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+ael Bolton fans, and newcomers to his voice as well.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. The cast alone is stellar but the story is exquisite and hauntingly beautiful. It starts out with three young kids at a boarding school in England and follows their journey through adult hood. I don't want to say much because I don't want to spoil it. But buy this film and you won't regret it. Just make sure you have tissues and allow your heart to melt and fall in love with Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan.

B0073ODRKG|5.0|This is a cheap and cool way to get all of Madonna's albums in a compact package that doesn't take up nearly as much shelf space as owning all 11 individually-cased CD's.  I call it the \\"Divorce Box-Set\\" because my ex kept all the Madonna albums when we separated.  : )<br /><br />There's not much point in reviewing the albums, because most people know what they're in for, but it's worthy to note that both the Erotica, and Music CD's each contain a single bonus track (\\"Did You Do It?\\" on the former and \\"Cyber Raga\\" on the latter).  They're not stellar songs, but it's neat to have them if you're a collector.  As for the packaging... each CD has a cardboard sleeve much like a miniature LP.  All 11 albums are stacked (loosely) in the outer box.  It's about the thickness of an old double/quadruple CD case... ala Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Vol 1 & 2, or Prince's Emancipation release.  Not bad for 11 albums.  And the price has even decreased since I purchased it, which makes it an awesome deal for anyone who wants all of Madonna's studio albums.<br /><br />I would have been willing to pay a little more to have the 3 compilation CD's included (Immaculate Collection, Something to Remember, and GHV2) but, I'm sure to many that would be repetitive.<br /><br />Great idea.  'Glad I bought it.

B0089PWU2E|5.0|The more we explore the roots of the British invasion and much rock music that came later, the Rockabilly style of Buddy Holly is perhaps the most synthesizing of all.<br />More than Elvis, Chuck Berry, Bill Haley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Eddie Cochrane.<br />He distilled all of their styles.<br />Vocally I hear a lot of John Lennon AND Paul McCartney.<br />The Beatles first recorded song was That'll Be the Day and it is a nearly identical version.<br /><br />As well as those boys could rock, the Crickets and Buddy could hold their own with anyone.<br />Buddy's song writing was also of the highest level, though he wasn't around long enough to evolve further. He died at 22!!<br />I can barely think of any singer who could have left such a legacy at that age had he or she died except Bob Dylan.<br />Guess who had a front seat and was 3 feet in front of Buddy while he performed at his last concert?<br />A 17 year old Bob Dylan!!!!  Bob says for a brief moment their eyes locked.<br />Maybe that was when the torch was passed so that the music DIDN'T die.<br />Most of these are a real revelation and are highly consistent in their level of artistry and inspired upbeatness a la the Beatles.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The lustful sexuality in this book is wonderful. The way Gideon and Eva can't get enough of each other is thrilling. I love that I never knew what was going to happen next. Gideon's moods change so often. Waiting on the third book to this series will be a task. I want more!!!
B00005IB57|5.0|For lovers of classical music, and Chopin in particular, this is a wonderful CD to own.  I enjoy playing it while driving - it both relaxes and cheers the heart always.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked this book, I have to admit I started reading it after the movie got so much attention at the Academy Awards, and since the movie doesn't come out on blu-ray for a couple weeks. It moves along at a steady pace, keeps your interest and had a good ending, I do recommend it for some nice, easy ready and a good story. Now I really want to see the movie!!!
B001IWV030|5.0|You have to be an Agatha Christie/Charlie Chan/Bogart/Thin Man fan to get the most out of this film. It's a great romp into the dysfunction of interpersonal communication among the geniuses of mystery.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Not a suspicious permission!

B0002TJGQS|5.0|Hard to beat the price!  This 5 pack was less than the single packs at stores in our area.  You can's go wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were fantastic! Bravo!!!<br /> I never thought I would get so addicted! This is the kind of book you stay up until 2am reading...that good.
B009RH973I|5.0|I just love my case! Holding it while reading is easy, since it has nicely contoured edges.  It just snaps on, no elastic at the corners to holdi t in place. Also, there's a hole in the spine so your charger can be plugged in  while the cover is closed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can honestly say that I do not like to read and a book has to really keep my attention to keep reading. This book has done it! Everytime I had to put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up and start reading it again!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|VERY GOOD AND EASY READ WITH THE TRANSPARENT THOUGHTS of a mogul. Simply a good read for a self starter. No magic pill, just inspiration to work harder and smarter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book continued right along with the first book of The Hunger Games and kept me wanting more, just like the first book had done. I can't wait to read the third and final book!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Mario has always been a favorite of mine. So I can tell that Lep's World ripped it off. But it is nice too be able to play Mario on my kindle. So, 4 stars.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I totally love this game. Eventually, my niece will have a chance to play! It also doesnt trigger my motion sickness. =)
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The series is so much fun to watch, I'm sorry the season is so short. Maggie Smith's dry wit always makes me laugh.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I have been hooked on the Metheny group since 1987 all of there music speaks beautiful story's in a magical universal language, but this concert in particular, The entire piece is as if it is channeled from another world, a higher consciences this music speaks to my soul like nothing else ever has, seen it 100 times and it is a must own for lovers of TRUE musical art. This is beyond words .A must OWN!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I almost didn't finish this book because I thought that it was very typical.  But I kept reading and I am glad I did . I would never have predicted the ending.  This book made me cry with joy.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a good movie.  Made you think about those suffering with addictions all around us.  Unexpected twists ..kept my attention
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is challenging, witty, and endlessly entertaining.  The levels are enough to keep even the most experienced casual game enthralled for hours.  With the ability to try multiple ways to solve each puzzle, you will want to keep playing over and over again.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I have the special DVD set and love the cd as well. A different side of PCM. Thanks so much!
B007XNAOS0|3.0|I discovered Baroness with the Red album, then went back and picked up their earlier releases, and now have heard three more colors, so to speak ... and for my tastes, Red was the standout, by a considerable degree.  That's the album with harsh/melodic/unpredictable tracks that I felt compelled to listen to again and again.  Blue Record, for me, didn't have any 'slap it on repeat' tracks, and Yellow/Green is even less compelling than Blue.  Bands change, sometimes it's a pleasant surprise, sometimes a disappointment.  Guess I have to get busy searching out the next RED or BLOOD MOUNTAIN ...
B000T05R90|5.0|My husband loves this. Being a huge Floyd fan, he can not get enough. Thank you so much! Very grateful.
141970642X|5.0|My son loves the books and the movies.  This book is a great addition to his Diary of A Wimpy Kid collection.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|What can you say about George? Awesome guy, awesome music! I love this cd! It's well used and greatly appreciated!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|one thing that I am complaining about is that there really are 80 some sounds. people don't count. there are 25 on the first three pages and about ten on the last. the only other thing is that you can only mix 10 sounds. its still AWESOME tho... :)
B00000721B|5.0|Thank you! It's great! I now have two versions of this cd. Being a big PCM fan, this cd is awesome!
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|When you get to a higher level, you must earn and pay additional money.  I do not like this aspect of the game.
B001NI9X42|5.0|I just love this cd! One of my favourites. I listen to it a lot. Thank you so much! Jeanne
B008OOYALE|3.0|It is a decent game to play, but I don't like that you have to wait until the energy recharges.
0374532281|4.0|Good story with plenty of surprises.  I don't like the &#34;F&#34; word, so that was the only negative part for me and the reason that I won't see the movie.  I don't understand why this has become such a popular word in our society.  Can't people find a different word to convey their displeasure?  Limited vocabularies, I guess.  Anyways, I would have loved to have seen the dance performed!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|okay for one,I cant even get it to open,two, lags,three welll i could say a lot and and I'm not gonna waist<br />my time sitting and writing about this game beacause ill tell you strait up......... IT IS A HORIBBLE GAME!!!! DO NOT DOWN LOAD IT! !!!!!!!
1451673442|5.0|The book was amazing, came at the perfect time in my life and created great Magic for me then.  Just make sure you never lose that feeling, never let it end.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|According to my husband - This is not like his usual stuff. These songs are Blues and Funk and they are wonderful! Each song is better than the last, making for a really enjoyable experience to sit through the entire CD.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Let me begin by letting you know that I'm a huge Bond fan.  I should also tell you that I am an even bigger fan of Daniel Craig's body of work.  That being said it comes as no surprise to those who know me that I love, love, love Skyfall!  Fantastic story with terrific acting.  The thing that surprised me the most with this installation of the Bond legacy is the reintroduction of \\"Q\\".  The role of \\"M\\" is superbly portrayed by Dame Judi Dench, the only woman in England that could do this role justice.  Kudos to the Skyfall team and can't wait until the next installment of this magnificent series.  God Save the Queen!!!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Game was great but app store would not let me download because file was large & my Wi-Fi was not functioning properly. otherwise it was nice.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Let's begin with wow!  Wow was this movie scary!  Sinister takes the audience on a hair raising ride as you follow Ethan Hawke's character on a fact finding mission for his new book.  He is a true crime author and has unwittingly put himself and his family in danger.  This movie keeps you guessing and certainly keeps your imagination growing.  If you are thinking of watching this movie here is a checklist I feel you should complete ahead of time.  Fist off make sure you turn a light on if it is dark outside. If you are alone call a friend over to watch this with you because to watch Sinister alone is simply crazy!  Lastly next time you move to a new house and you go into your attic and there is a box of old films...DO NOT WATCH THEM!  Simply call your agent and get a refund..lol!
B002QBS9KE|3.0|The ear pad does ok, but its hard to keep on the bud, this is the reason I had to buy the extra pack, comes off and it gets lost.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I have to admit that when I started watching Argo I didn't have the highest expectations but boy oh boy was I surprised!  The retelling of true events sometimes comes across the screen as obvious and predictable, partly because it is of course a true story but Ben Affleck did a terrific job directing this movie and telling its story.  This is a must watch for anyone interested in a night at home watching an intense movie with flawless acting and superb direction...and I swear that Ben Affleck is not the author of this revue, lol!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like how I can plug my Kindle Fire onto the charger lying on the floor, me lying in bed, without running short of cable. 5 foot USB cable - sweet!
B002R25THI|5.0|This movie is also too scary and tension-filled, and is so by dint of little touches. Alan Arkin is unforgettable as the very evil bad guy. The movie exploits Hepburn's innocent-and-perfect persona to fiendish and wonderful effect.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I got everything I expected when this item was sent to me and it arrived exactly when they said it would.
0062014536|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, I even pressed through all the bad language just knowing the ending would make up for it.  Nope.  It didn't.  Nothing is resolved!  If the author didn't want to focus on a love triangle, why did she write one in the first place?!  Who'd she choose, Julian or Alex?  What happened to the resistance? Hana?  This was a waste of time.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|Great content, but issues with the quality of the physical disks.  The first order was defective, as disk #2 did not play.  Processed the return and received a replacement, with the same results except that disk #3 did not play.  It was very frustrating as you are prepared to watch, have to fight the player to attempt to get the disk to play, and are then required then to use the included digital copy versions.  I paid for and want a fully-functioning set of disks, not some that work and others that don't.
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is SOOO fun love if great for every age I love it be thankful people who have electronics be thankful PEACE OUT GIRL SCOUT
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Watched the entire series several times, still not tired of it.  A definite recommend for all women, a few men may like it too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i loved all three of these books, the first was the best but this last one i thought was really good too. not as full of action as the first but still very well written! my favorite books!
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Our little boy just loves this. He's still trying to grab and hold things and kept knocking his soother out of his mouth. But this stays in place and he can hold on to it against his chest.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I am very pleased with this app.  I have tried other sound apps and this is the only one threade that has the kind of tools and customization that I want.  Not to mention all the sounds.  :P<br /><br />My two favorite features are the timer,so it doesn't stay on all night, and the mix option, so i can mix and match the sounds I want.<br /><br />I would highly recommend getting this app.
B0045A8KY4|1.0|The tapes arrived today in a broken box and won't play on any of the 5-dvd player's, screen shows won't play in this region.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I loved this movie.  Anything with DW in it will be good.  It is different from what he usually portrays in movies.  But none the less a good movie.
1844137872|5.0|Banksy has no production problem, and he has no talent issue. Often, from what I've seen at least, those with the most talent have the hardest time producing something for the public. I have a good friend in New Hampshire who's a better writer than any of the New Yorker's 40 Under 40, but he can't seem to complete a novel, or novella, or even a short story that he's comfortable submitting. Meanwhile, I've had creative writing teachers who don't know the difference between a gerund and a noun publish on the merit of their networking skills. That makes me sick.<br /><br />In any case, part of why Banksy can produce so much is that he has a good paradigm to follow. Late in the book he writes, \\"Think from outside the box, collapse the box and take a [expletive] sharp knife to it.\\" He doesn't mean that, of course, because his art form is a type of box: he uses spray paint and stencils to draw edgy messages in public places. What he means by box, it seems, is what Whitman meant when he wrote \\"Reexamine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults our own soul\\": don't accept what holds you back.<br /><br />And that's powerful. I don't know how Banksy funded himself, but I have a feeling he's of the mindset that the real work starts when the nine to five stops. If he even had a nine to five. He might have said screw it altogether. There are plenty of self help books and motivational speakers saying some form of Follow your heart. There are few, if any, books and speakers saying Be poor as piss, but do what you want. Banksy's not a self help guru; however, it seems to me the dissatisfaction he taps into in his audience is from the same place as the dissatisfaction that adults who listen to motivational speakers feel.<br /><br />That's not a bad thing. It says something about human nature that so many people are so often unhappy and unfulfilled. Banksy often makes fun of people who feel contentment in easy and bourgeois ways. Take his stencil of \\"This is not a photo opportunity\\" put in places that tourists like to photograph, for instance. His most powerful work, though, has the strongest social messages: a Guantanamo detainee with a bag over his head spray painted on a busy London walkway, or a 24-year-old with angel wings and a halo sitting on the ground smoking and drinking.<br /><br />These are images of stifled lives, and they're the ones that make Banksy Banksy. The Guantanamo detainee's life is being taken away by legal quagmire, and the 24-year-old's life is being taken away because he has no meaningful opportunity. Banksy has been able to break through the wall of life to find opportunity, and he argues others can as well. One piece, at a Ramallah checkpoint along the Isreal-Palestine wall, shows a small child with a yellow toy pail and hand shovel. It's painted in front of some rocks, so it appears the child has broken through. His message: To break through, all it takes is the heart and irrational determination of a child.<br /><br />And some toys.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I couldn't put this one down.  Another great Harry Bosch novel.  It was a good way to pass the time while sick.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This story grabbed me & I could not put it down!  The story of imperfect people trying to adjust by rebuilding their lives in a less then perfect society touched my heart.  It also pointed out that even when a person is least receptive to help there are people willing to take the gamble.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton keeps you watching due to the characters you lie and hate and the beautiful setting. A must watch, again and again!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Bought for a friend for Christmas and they loved the first series.  So did I, but I watched it AMC.  Thought other's might like it also and they do!!  All's good!
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys delving into the lives of others from days gone by. The build up of passion and tension between Stephen and Isabelle is contrasted beautifully with gripping war scenes with life on a precipice. Wonderful character development, beautiful story line, superbly developed. A must see!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|LOVED THE APP. BUT HATED THE ads that came with it.  Slowed facebook to a crawl and it locked up several times  Definitely for the kindle fire....,!!!<br /><br />Mikegrel
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I got this app when it was the FAOTD, but I would gladly have paid the asking price, had I known what a terrific gaming app this would be.  I used to be into sudoku a few years back, but don't really play it much anymore.  I figured, what the heck, it's free, I can play it for a day or two and uninstall it if I want.  This app has soooooo many games and variations that you will probably NEVER play them all.  When they say &#34;10,000&#34;, they mean it!!!  Whatever your skill level, there are plenty of fresh, unique board layouts to choose from, as well as interesting variations (&#34;color&#34;, &#34;jigsaw&#34;, etc.).  The user interface is well designed, including &#34;undo&#34; and &#34;redo&#34; buttons.  Being able to individually highlight numbers that have been placed is a HUGELY helpful factor.  Needless to say, I'm back to being hooked on sudoku!!!  Seriously, I don't give many apps this much of a glowing recommendation, but these developers did a terrific job, and I highly recommend this to sudoku enthusiasts of all levels.
B008K8X0IS|4.0|the quality is awesome! and all the bonus features... AWESOME!<br />i didn't get the 1 episode of season 2. which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. but it doesn't matter now. I already ordered season 2.<br />the dragon egg is pretty cool. It's small, but heavy and feel pretty expensive.. I am satisfied  :P
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game I am addicted to it . Totally worth the seven dollars. Must have
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|I think this is great. I'm always excited to open this app and see what awaits me. I've gotten many books through this app
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!! I will always remember this book as an adventurous story and I really want to give props to Yann Martel. Way to go!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it has lots of cool things and if you login with facebook you can get 5000 free coins
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|I love the bluesy feel and the rendition of Layla!  All the artists on this album are great. This showcases Eric Clapton's diverse talent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Book! Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author, I love all of his books.Can't wait for the next one. By the way, I also live on the NC Coast.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves it, she really likes the mucking part. The graphics are great and it runs pretty smooth. Very cute.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I Love the dictionary. It is the best book I read, I always fined what I need to knowLOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love love love love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):)<3<br /><br />  -Lily Snow
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I enjoy this app.since the kindle fire doesn't come with a video recording option this is perfect. And takes quality images and sound. Have fun with it!
B00AFOS6QG|3.0|Should we have called this a Bad Seeds album without Mick Harvey?  For me, it is soundtrack by Cave and Ellis looking for a movie.  Higgs Bosom Blues, acclaimed by some reviewers as the heart of the album, is a throw away filler.  All things must pass—but I hope for Cave with Harvey and Ellis again.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Useless, much easier to go to the Mail on line website it has a better layout. Also even though the app has been down loaded I get constantly pestered to down load the thing again and again.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|this is like most G5 games, not especially difficult and only the first chapter is free.  all in all. ok for free wouldn't. pay for it
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I hesitated reading it because I thought it sounded so morbid (that everyone but one person had to die).  Boy, am I glad I re-thought that one!!!!  This book was fantastic.  From the time Katniss took her sister's place in the games I was hooked. I held my breath with every break of a twig or anything that might mean that she was in trouble of being killed.  This was one of those books that you could not figure out what was coming next.  You think you know how the story will end but there are many twists that leaves you wondering what will be around the corner in the next chapter.  Would recommend to anyone regardless of age.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very realistic and actually a lil challenging.bits a great app for both kids and actual riders. i love it
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|i bought one of these for an extra to keep in my purse so if I'm at work I can plug it into my computer if I need a charge or if I'm in the car I can plug it into my car charger.  I keep it with me so I never have to be without a charge for my kindle.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This is nice. The length is perfect. It's a quick read. I would recommend it.  It's a light read so it it's different from some other murder mysteries.
B00800WIK2|5.0|This Works Really Great Because It Works, I Love It!<br />Please Note: This Dosen't Work With Cases!<br />This Was Worth Every Penny!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great read. This book had me enthralled for the whole duration. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.<br />For any fantasy fanatics this is a must buy.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|There are 8 different characters that allow the player to play this game with different weapon sets.  Not too difficult, just enough to keep your interest.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|i have always enjoyed helen hunt - so i knew i wished to see it. guess we are all curious about folks with disabilities & what they are capable of doing & all ... it was interesting & you really felt for him & his wish to do right by his religious & all that.
0321356683|2.0|if one doesn't program in Java anymore.  Because for my work it's become too complex, too difficult to navigate amongst components, and not very useful in the scientific models I write.
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|I have had great trouble trying to make this adapter work correctly. Running Windows 8, 64bit I plugged it in and it immediately recognized it. So far so good.<br /><br />About a minute later I get a pop up that the USB Device is not recognized. I've uninstalled/re-installed it several times. I also downloaded the driver (even though it says it's not needed). However Windows 8 always tells me I already have the correct driver installed.<br /><br />The other issue I've been having is setting a static IP address. I hard code the address, close the properties window, go back in, and it thinks it's set back to DHCP again.<br /><br />I have attempted to contact Anker support but I just get their voicemail. At this point I'm going to return it.
0307352153|4.0|Admittedly, as an introvert, I found the concept of this book interesting, particularly after seeing the author, Susan Cain, give a talk on the subject. As a work of writing, discussion, and food for thought, I found it invigorating. As a tool for two primary audiences, I think this book has the opportunity to plow new ground for how contemporary life is organized.<br /><br />Cain, a Harvard Law graduate, and self described introvert herself, organizes this book with a series of thesis statements, built around her very extensive travels, to essentially build case studies for how introverts are expected to operate, how they actually do function and ways that a society, company, organization or culture that is built to recognize the role of extroverts as the primary success leaders, can cooperate and work better with introverts.<br /><br />The two primary audiences for this book are introverts who need perhaps reassurance and points for how they can arrange their lives around their natural, God given talents and inclinations, for the flourishing of their worlds. The second audience is extroverts, and especially for how those who naturally assume that extroversion is the primary marker of competence, can work with and cooperate with the unique skills of introverts.<br /><br />Cain cites historical and present day case studies from the worlds of business, politics, religion, science, and other disciplines to show how successful introverts have brought ideas and work that have greatly enhanced their worlds. For that alone, this book should function as an encouragement and a pointer so that anyone can more naturally work to have people put out what fits them best.<br /><br />The writing is enjoyable to read, because as an introvert, Cain does have a tremendous amount of empathy for her subjects, and the reader as well.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like this little portable sharpener, fits in my range bag and really does the job. I highly recommend getting one!
B0076DELIG|4.0|A very good read made even more comfortable and entertaining by the humanity with which Connelly invests my old friend, Harry Bosch.  Jmikepryor
0399224459|5.0|I teach pre-school and my children LOVE this book. It is a lovely story about animals in a zoo who go home with the zookeeper!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It was awesome until it deleted all my progress and I had spent 4months on something and I checked the next day and raged so badly..... Ughh...
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works just as expected.  Only thing is they limit you to stay within your LAN.  You cant remote via WAN on the free version.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love it fun to play<br />Interesting and they have the regular characters<br />Looks great with the hd I highly recommend this game
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It does a little practice to get the hang of it. You'll probably waste a bottle or two until you figure it out, but it wll cut bottles. Works better on some than others. I had the best luck on thin, even thickness, glass bottles. Beer bottles actually cut perfect almost everytime. The hard part isn't really this cutter, its trying to heat/cool the score line to get it to crack. I found rotating the bottle over a small candle's flame for a couple minutes and then cooling in the sink worked best.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is the easy access to you tube.  Every other day or two I check you tube to see if there is anything interesting.  Having this app makes it convenient for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed the other novels by Colleen Hoover and she didn't disappoint in Hopeless either. I can't wait to read more from her.
1439156816|4.0|Good purchase. Quick shipment
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Not an action game, but lots of fun if you like building and enjoy cute animals .  a little annoying if you don't do the Facebook thing
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game and challenging too. I just wish connecting pipes was good enough. But you have to fill in every space which makes it more difficult to get perfect. I think hints cost money.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|my  three year cat loves the campfire sound to sleep by. I had it on timer and when it was done, he got up amd left. I turned it back on and he came back and went back to sleep.

B005EHILV4|5.0|I had some issues with recording latency at first with my old laptop (not great specs) but it works great with my new one. Driver installation was automagic with no issues, and I now use this for music production as my main audio interface.

B00004UEE5|5.0|The CD arrived on time and in perfect condition. My favorite part of this symphony is the Adagietto.<br />No wonder, the great composer Leonard Bernstein asked to be buried with the score of this music placed on his heart...

B0073ODRKG|4.0|I purchased this set while it was on sale.  It came out to about four dollars an album, which isn't bad at all.  You get exactly what it says-the complete studio albums.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It's a good set for people that haven't bought all the albums yet, or need to replace some.  I was missing three of them before getting this, and I wanted a back up copy of Ray of Light since it isn't available separately anymore.<br /><br />Each album brings back memories of when I first heard them, or heard about them.  I got the debut, Like a Virgin, True Blue, and Like a Prayer when I was a kid.  The first 3 are still my favorites.  When Erotica came out, I didn't like her new image or the 90s dance beats, so I didn't buy the album.  I also didn't buy Bedtime Stories even though I liked the title track.  Ray of Light came out and I got that one.  I thought it was great.  Music continued her electronica style.  I was surprised to see the copy in this set contains an 11th track, \\"American Pie\\", a song I hated when it was new but I don't mind it now.  My original copy only has 10 tracks.  I heard American Life was her worst album and didn't buy that one either.  I didn't like the song Hollywood very much and the rest seemed boring.  But now I like at least half the album, especially \\"X-Static Process\\" which is one of my favorites.  Confessions is a really good dance album, it has one of my favorite songs on it, \\"Get Together\\".  I like all the songs except two.  Hard Candy is often called her worst album now, but I don't think it's so bad.  I like half of it while the other half is okay.  \\"Dance 2night\\" is a great retro sounding song, like an early 80s dance/R&B/Michael Jackson style song, with a really great ending that is different from the rest of the song.<br /><br />There are several songs on Erotica, Bedtime Stories, American Life, and Hard Candy that I don't like.  It would've been nice if Ray of Light had contained the Japan bonus track \\"Has to Be\\".  While looking at this set and listening to it, you can't help but feel a little disappointed that this is not a box set that contains all her studio recordings.  Songs like Into the Groove, Vogue, and Crazy For You are all required in a Madonna collection, so if you are just starting, you will have to buy the Celebration cd or Immaculate Collection (or both) to fill it out.  Also Something to Remember which has songs like This Used to Be My Playground and I'll Remember.  Still missing are songs like Gambler and Time Stood Still.<br /><br />For what it is, it's good.  But you will need to buy more to fill out a collection of her best songs.  An official collection of her rarer songs, extended versions, and b-sides would be great to compliment this set.  I wonder why none are available?  There seems to be a demand for it among her fans.ng at this set and listening to it, you can't help but feel a little disappointed that this is not a box set that contains all her studio recordings.

B004LWZW24|4.0|I do the same as with paranormal activity, read review on it. It's the same!!  Same enjoyment!!! I really liked Insidious, spooky scary!!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|The LCD Touch BacPac is awesome for changing settings and/or reviewing and deleting unwanted videos without a computer.  The touch panel is easy to use quite reliable (so far)!  The LCD Touch BacPac comes with 3 housings:<br />1. an open housing where the touch screen is completely uncovered.<br />2. a wimpy (3m) waterproof housing where the touch screen is protected by a thin film (touch does not work under water).<br />3. a full waterproof housing which doesn't expose the touch panel at all.<br /><br />Things to keep in mind:<br />- The Hero3 is too small for use as a point-and-shoot, and this isn't any taller or wider than the camera itself.<br />- The Hero3 Battery BacPac doesn't have an add-on port, so you can't have an extra battery on your Hero3 and use this at the same time.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Spooky, Scary catchy scenes!! A different kind of scary, everyone has a different theory. But yeah it was a good movie!!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I chose to rate this product bcouse I was looking for somting to watch along with my wife in a cosy weekend. This is suitable for us. fun and with a point. I really recomend this to my friends. Cool! :-)
B009UNGYHG|1.0|I tried three replacements, The call audio was terrible on all three. I have a Samsung Galaxy III. No difference when paired to my wife's iphone 4. Finally went to Costco and bought a Motorola Elite.The Elite works fine.Returned the Legend to Amazon.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great CD from start to finish! I would recomend this to people who prefer more mellow rock. Buy it now!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What else can you say about Downton?  It is so engaging, I couldn't help but finish the whole season in one sitting!  Can't wait to see season 4.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Fun game like previous reviews dont like being pushed to login to Facebook. Otherwise I enjoy the game.  Thank you

B008469DGY|5.0|This is fun and challenging! My 3 year old LOVES to play &#34;golf&#34; with his dad ever since they played an arcade game! this was a great at home subsitiute!
B000B589JI|5.0|I always hate it when I am away from home and my Zippo runs out of fluid.  Now I keep this in my car and it works beautifully.  I was worried when I bought it that it might leak, but with the way Zippo designed it, it is totally leak-proof.  The quality of the aluminum and the craftsmenship is awesome.  I love the fact that it comes with a small flat &#34;screwdriver&#34; to change the flint.  The only issue I have is the rubber flint carrier.  It says it can hold 2 flints but I can only get 1 to fit because it is a tight fit and it is difficult to remove the flint when you do need it.  I always keep an extra flint tucked under the bottom felt on the lighter anyway, so the rubber flint holder isn't a big deal to me. This is a must have accessory for anyone who uses a Zippo and it is made with the same quality one would expect from Zippo.
0486266885|5.0|a classic book at a great price in a large size book, awesome<br /><br />the book measures about 5 1/4 x 8 1/4 making it very easy to handle
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I was a fan of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 but I much prefer this version.  Better grapics with more details.  Plus the ride camera is a cool features.  The layout is a little different and it takes some time to get used to that but nothing major.  I particularly enjoy the water rides/pool options.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Actually works has some very good music videos both old ones and modern ones<br />easy to use which is a big plus for me
B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of Dr. Alexander's colleagues said that his story should have no more credibility than if he were a plumber. But that's obviously not true. The book's title is a grabber, though Alexander has complained about it elsewhere, saying it was foisted on him by the publisher. Nevertheless it's his brain surgeon expertise that makes his NDE story as compelling as it is. Otherwise, Alexander's afterlife, in addition to being trite, is rather boring. More interesting is his explication of the old idea that the brain is merely a filter for a consciousness that is elsewhere, or as the software guys put it a non-local distributed system, similar to the way a smart phone or tablet keeps most of its data on the cloud. One thing I did not understand was how, when Alexander repeatedly claimed that his brain had been \\"destroyed\\" by the bacteria invading it---thereby undermining any notion that his NDE was an illusion created by his brain---that it was later somehow naturally-restored and he could resume a normal life. Perhaps I missed the explanation or it will be addressed on the web site, eternea dot org, he's created for study of similar experiences.
B007DIQC90|5.0|an intriguing debut from a hot new band from Iceland of monsters and men combine raw rock and techno with wonderful results can't wait for the next album
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son loves this movie! I recored it on my DVR at christmas and it has a lot of commercials so we wanted to get him the movie! Next I will have to get him his own TV/DVD bc I'm tired of watching this movie 100 times a week! lol
B008NW67E0|5.0|a fabulous follow up album to a wonderful debut mumford and sons are trying to bring back folk music and are doing it successfully
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Much history of George Harrison as well as the Beatles. Love the music. It's too long to rent you must buy it.
B000069HKH|5.0|I consider this album as part of the healing process after the 9-11-01 attacks on the trade center Bruce uses music to help heal people during troubling times this proves why he is the boss
1558908846|5.0|Picture quality is good for a movie made in 1995. Digit copy could have been better. DVD play well and did not have any error while playing.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|a wonderful debut from a fabulous new band fans and critics were both impressed very enjoyable can't wait for the next album
B004LWZW42|5.0|I enjoy this movie - Picture quality alway appear very well and did not have any trouble playing. Movie is well worth the money and the action within.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I have never read this author before but heard great things about her writing.  She is brutal with her characters, none of them seemed to have any redeeming values.  It is a quick read.  And despite the fact that its a dark story, I enjoyed the read.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Found to be a very good story line, as well as staying on one plant vise going to another plant. Picture quality is very very good and alway play well and awesome on my flat screen. Look forward to watching it time after time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than the first...better graphics, better set up, cool features-you start out jumping to a zip line, you also ride in a mine cart. My boyfriend, 5-year-old, and myself are always fighting who's going to play and/or who's turn it is. If your not careful hours will go by and you won't even know it. If you're reading this, stop now and download this game, seriously you'll love this game!
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|I like the fact that this set comes with five minifigures. The wall is really well built as well. I would have liked to seen more Rohan soldiers, though.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Lauren Oliver is brilliant.<br />I can understand the upset over certain aspects of this book, but it is REAL. This is not some fairy-tale. This is a book that describes, in detail, the price of Freedom. I sat at the end of this book and thought--a lot. Out of all three book, Pandemonium is still  my favorite, but that does not mean that Requiem is any less loved or important to the trilogy. Her writing is superior, and her characters are believable and raw. She is an inspiration, and this series is one of the BEST I have ever read.<br />It is different. It will make you think. It will tear at your heart and tug at your soul.<br />But that, in my opinion, is the best kind of book there is.<br />I highly recommend this.<br />Thank you Lauren Oliver.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|So far so good. I had to turn off the sound because its really creepy. I will try any hidden object game because they are fun.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|all of the other bourne were and are much better ! if i'd known i wouldnt have bought it ya just dont mess with matt d.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really wanted the battery app so I could keep up with my battery percentage like I do with my iPhone. This app turned out to be better than I expected. I really love that it breaks down how much time you have for each different thing you may do as well as tell you long it will take to charge. Highly recommended!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I love this CD and am grateful to have been lucky enough to find it for such a great deal.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it very much .!!!!! Lol but it needs to be more high-tech and stuff but I love revisits like it's real and people get a lot of experience and responsibility . It's like I<br />Ur taking care of a real horse
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I love this CD and am grateful to have been lucky enough to find it for such a great deal.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The game is very good for the kids.  They love the animals and how they move around. It is a lot of fun for them.
B000Z9XJ6S|4.0|great shape. although it was a little late it was worth it. would definitely order again.  looking for el dorado on blu ray now
B005NFJAZS|3.0|This review is for the re-release dvd (2011) of the music man.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite musicals.  For me, the highlights are the Barbershop quartet(the Buffalo Bills).  They really steal the show!  when they do the song, Lida Rose, with Shirley Jones... well it is just tremendous!<br /><br />I have the previous release (on DVD) and its ok, but the picture quality is very 'grainy' and has a lot of digital noise and edge enhancements.<br /><br />I purchased the 2011 DVD release, thinking that they would have would have improved the video quality.  After all, they did just release it on BLU RAY, and usually the DVD release would be from the same master video.<br /><br />Sadly, the new DVD release is only slightly better than the old DVD.  It has all the same video noise as my old copy.  The only improvment, that I can tell, is the sound quality is a little better.<br /><br />Oh well, looks like the BLU ray is the one to get!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I really enjoy Grisham's writing style, character development, & general flow.  This book did not have a great story, but was still interesting.  I have read almost all of his books and will likely continue to do so.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I just wanted to leave my five star grade for this movie. I could palpate the desperation and fear. Great acting.
B000008L90|5.0|I remembered I had it on vynil and for some time I wanted to get it on cd. Finally I got it at a very reasonable price at amazon.com. I never understood why this album never became well received and a success. Donna was still sounding her best and delivered great songs. For all Donna Summer fans, this should be  a must have!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun but it suck because the games are expensive and I cant get them and I cant get the games.
140053271X|5.0|It's the best, if you are ready to do some reprogramming. Yoo can make it Android 2.1 device that can install anything from Market. It makes Nook not just reader, but tablet-pc with e-mail, browser, games, etc.! Quality is good and touch works fine.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is a must. I hate calculating/converting fractions the long way. I tried others, but this app is the simplest to use. Where were you when I was in high school?
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am giving this app 5 stars for two reasons. One, I like the app and I use it to help with my insomnia. Second, Iphnos  Software promised to continue the free updates if did so (we'll see).<br /><br />For the people who are having trouble with the loops. There is a loops adjustment in the settings menu. I have adjusted the loop pauses to the point of virtually unnoticeably. However, my issue is that the sound samples are way too short and can get very repetitious rather quickly, especially when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />If they update these issues then the 5 stars I gave them are legit, if they don't...well I have to downgrade them to a 4 stars because I still enjoy the app, it  just has to quit crashing and start running in the background during other opened programs again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's friggin awesome. Ok so the only bad part is how you get Titanic. A good game. I reccomend getting this.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the king of all Sudoku apps. It has so many variants and difficulties, you can't really ask for more. Works great on android and even better on the kindle fire. Only thing I can say is, it is very difficult, easy is not like easy from a Sudoku book, not a bad thing just a note.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|How wonderful a book! Has it all--a mystery, a spooky bookstore, spookier people (Googlers),  a quest, good friends, adventure, masterful plotting and pacing. Great read and very satisfying ending.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|To me, the Bee Gees represent the real genius of good, melodic pop music with an energizing beat.  If you have enjoyed their music over the years, this compilation will really remind you of how truly remarkable these artists were and why you will always remember them..
0393316041|2.0|I belong to the small group of people who did not like the book , for the reasons already mentioned by several readers.<br />I found a lot of the narrated anecdotes were not very interesting and mostly self-celebrating. Several times the description insists on tiny details, becoming quite boring and repetitive.<br />Prose is extremely poor and childish, and whatever is the reason , it is so bad that affects also the few loosely entertaining parts.<br />I struggled a lot to finish the book and until the last few pages I was convinced to rate my experience with 1 star, but I found the last chapter so good I changed my mind.<br />At the end, while you are still wondering what was the point of the whole book, those simple considerations strike you and catch you by surprise.<br />2,5 stars.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The finest series programming I have seen on TV in my 74 years.  Every character is perfectly cast and performs brilliantly, accompanied by a wonderful musical score.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I love Plume for Twitter on my Android phone and I just downloaded it from Amazon for my tablet and its sooooo nice. I love the ease and look of the application. Coloring tweets are a big thing to me and I love that this app lets me do that. My timeline is so colorful now! Haha. This is a must have app!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|The album is very enjoyable not only because of Ms. Boyle's undeniable talent but also because the arrangements and orchestrations are wonderful.  Donnie Osmond adds a nice touch to the CD, and I never tire of hearing Michael Crawford sing &#34;Phantom&#34; music.  I think the latter's duet with Susan actually surpasses his duet with Barbra Streisand.  My only disappointment is that she did not sing a few more melodious &#34;pop&#34;- songs, which she is also able to do very well.
B0000542D2|5.0|If you love The Beatles, no doubt about it you will love this movie. The first film the group made is a great tale about the band making their way to an appearance and all of the misadventures that happen along the way. Great for classic movie fans, and Beatles fans alike.
B007NZDES0|4.0|Sade Does it Again<br /><br />Good music, entertaining, colorful, adventuresome and Kinda exciting. You could not ask for a more entertaining DVD.<br /><br />.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|The graphics in this game are surprisingly good! When you start a new level and the camera pans in, awesome. The game itself is something new. I'v never played anything like it. It starts out easy & fun, and gradually gets hard & fun, and then it gets frustratingly hard, but still fun. It's difficult to explain how the game works so just try it out. I think this is a good game for all ages and tastes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's SOOO fun and addictive and graphics are very good. Can get a little bit frustrating but that's what makes it soooo fun. You should get it is great !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my God this book was so awesome!!!!!! I cried the whole way through it for the most part. It does keep you trying to guess what's going to happen next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When we are in the same Wi-Fi  area we try to join but we can't. We need help on how to join servers on the kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it i have always wanted a horse really really badly and now i can have one thanks to this app
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|i will like the game after i play the game but for somepeople they dont like the game at first but then they like the game
1589795474|5.0|Statistical survey of millionaires. Surprise was that most got that way by working hard and saving/investing their money. Proves that our parents and grand parents knew what they were talking about.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I think this would have been a great game if this would have let me finished. All these sorts of games do this. Ya know... you think it's free so you download it then about 3-4 levels after it freezes on you until you buy the whole version. It stinks! But it's true. That what happened to me. Some also say &quot; it won't download on my Kindle Fire&quot; it might but it didn't happen to me so that's why I gave this game a three.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Quick shipment and delivery. Worked perfectly the first time. Makes it possible to backup digital photos on your iPad. Be advised that the transfer process is slow.
B001453LSI|4.0|Give her a listen! A great addition to singers like Connie Evingson, Susie Arioli and Paris Combo. Also purchased her &#34;My One and Only Thrill&#34;.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This is a great series, if you like vampires and love stories.  There are story lines that keep you guessing.
B000QK7YQ2|4.0|These guys hung it all out there, wrenching their own rides, living out of a van, homemade dirt track slides... good stuff.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great series and author.  The trilogy was suspenseful and intriguing.  This was a great first series for E. L. James
B0095P29EG|3.0|Can't remember the actual origin of Thor from my comic book days but this was an alright storyline.  Does set Loki up as the villan for the Avengers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was great to read.  I didn't want to put any of the books done, until I was finished with them.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Saw Muse perform March 7th in Minneapolis.  Undeniably the most entertaining concert I have attended.  The gang played 8 tracks off the 2nd Law and I have to say, IMPRESSIVE!  My particular favorite song is Follow Me and Supremacy off the album.  Now add the visuals, the inverted pyramid screen and their sound stage you appreciate the artistic and performances of Muse Live.  If you have not seen them live... go see them.  They topple U2, Coldplay, Aerosmith...etc, they are the \\"Big Ticket\\".
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had always heard my friends talk about this series and didn't know what all of the hype was about....until I watched it.  Love it!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The acting is spectacular, the writing is incredible.  The talent that goes behind this show is truly historic, and should go down as one of the best, if not the best TV shows in the history of television.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series was great to read, and fun to discuss with friends.  E. L. James is a good author and kept the trilogy interesting.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Can't help but love a Boston based film with Ben Affleck and so well done. The blu ray picture is great also.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|This is a great series to watch.  We have seen every episode and are never disappointed with any of them.
140053271X|5.0|Great e-reader!<br />The user interface is great, atractive, smooth and clean!  There were only 2 minnor issues:<br /><br />1. The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N support page fixed that.<br /><br />2. The description says that the device has a 2GB internal memory, the one I got doesn't have that amount of memory.  Probably someone forgot to insert the 2GB SD Card in the device, but that's not a big deal!<br /><br />Overrall, great device!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Son loves this app and so do I.  Love slicing the fruit and building up levels.  We ended up buying the full version.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Slow steady pace and then 150 finalpages of twists and turns. Harry Hole is a great and flawed protagonist, a bit cliched but good nonetheless
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|While I love playing this game, not on the Kindle app.  The app constantly freezes up and takes forever to open when it does open, it takes forever to open one game or it just freezes completely up.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|A Gung Ho, live by the Rules New York Police Detective becomes an outcast.  He is then assigned to form his own team of Honest cops who would not take a nickel off the Sidewalk. His assignment is to find and to arrest Major Drug traffickers in 1970s New York City. Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington were superb!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|All the versions for Angry Birds are awesome, but this one is my son's favorite.  It's more simple and easier for him to use.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read some great books that have left me breathless..Well Colleen Hoover Hopeless did this tenfold. What a tragic beginning for a young girl Hope. Heart wrenching at times and just when I thought I had a clue I was so wrong. And Holder wow what a fine young man. This book was WONDERFULLY written and very very emotional at times. This is a MUST READ!!!!
161218412X|5.0|Beautifully assembled, easy to read, a great addition to anyany collection. Pictures are nice accompaniment to the classic text. Heirloom is right i will give my kids these stories one day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first I overlooked the app and website because my MOM was really into it, so I figured it wouldn't be something I might be interested in. But after playing on it for about an hour I realized its majesty! I love the organization factor, I love the storage for links.  It is useful to any demographic. I even have a board for my hubby!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I gave Gone Girl 3 stars mainly because I did not like the conclusion. The ending seemed very abrupt and manufactured in order to end the story. In all, the plot was interesting with a major surprise toward the middle. It did drag in a few spots. I would recommend this book with the above caveats.
B004N66XYE|5.0|what can i say my wife and I have been following this series since it first began and she has watched it time and again
B00395ZYVS|3.0|This books brings up interesting thoughts to ponder about multicultural marriage and multicultural adoption.  Somewhere in the book the adoptive mother tucks in and seems to be unable to figure out what exactly to do with her daugher.<br />SPOILER ALERT<br /> Fast forward to the loving family in India....yes indeed they love this girl.  But the girl in unable to make the move to meet her biological parents.  I couldn't figure that out.<br />Ultimately for me this was not a satisfying read.
B009DJB9HC|3.0|well - BCC has proven to be the pre eminent modern classic rock and roll band- no doubt about it-<br />But- I just listened to this cd again and I finally realized why it just doesnt fire me up like i thought it should.<br />It's the mix- plain and simple and also that fact that I feel that Joe Bonamassa phoned in his solos- which most of are lost once again in the mix and a bit muddy.<br />How to this day- pro engineers and producers think that they have to shove a certain sound down the listeners throat is beyond me- these guys dont need any help- mix it so that I-the listener can pick out and focus on what i want to focus on. The songs- well- they're not that bad- If i could understand wtf Glenn Hughes is screamin about 75% of the cd-I might like em more- but once again- the mix is shoddy. too much drums and guitar- not enough vocs-  If any of the readers here have ever heard acdc back in black- or the cult- sonic temple- or UFO- walk on water- those- hard rock albums- were perfectly mixed- this one could have been a pleasure to listen to as much as the 3 I mentioned- but once again -it falls short due to the in your face- out front- over driven mess of a mix-  and the brilliant  keyboards by Derek Sherinian- they are there but not so much as advertised- you can barely tell there are keys in over half the songs. Jason Bonham is like the other 3 an awesome musician - Glenn Hughes- awesome bass lines- great vocs- but if any of the band members had anything to do with the final mix I would tell them that they over did it and missed the mark on what could have been a great final cd to have put out- instead- people wont ever get to hear what the songs should sound like until they hear them live- which probably will never happen.
0307742997|5.0|Can I tell you one more time I love Jo Nesbo?  This to me is the finest in fictional crime!  Read it.  You'll be a convert.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent.I use this every day to check when to 're charge..it has the option to set a visual reminder when the battery is running low.there are graphs and statistics too which are interesting , a bit of fun extra for me but I reckon some people could make them useful. One of the first apps I downloaded 3 weeks ago ,one of the best and definitely the most used.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you are a fan of Reacher, this book is for you.  Even after so many books in this series, Child is still wrting strong and moving Reacher along.  That's why I keep reading this series, and hoping there will be more, more more Jack Reacher novels.
0062238868|5.0|What an insight into the training our military's special elite go through.  Haven't finished reading it yet, but what I have read is fascinating.
0061134007|4.0|Maybe too many twists and turns here to make this ultimately readable.  But Jo Nesbo doesn't fail to please even in this, which I consider his weakest book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, the author did a lot of math.  I didn't check it for him though.  A great survival story.  It reminds of of Robinsoncruso (sp) on Mars.  I bet the authors saw that flick.  No aliens though and no Friday.  Great story.  Enjoy.
1423140605|5.0|because I really like how it got to me before march 18. It is  a really good book to read.
B008220C38|5.0|I found this film a riviting masterpiece of a production, an expanded stage play - the stage of life, the patterns of life - highly stylized, dance-like, like a poem, especially with the Russian backdrop.  The main plot is juxtaposed with the simpler, more earthy Russian peasant life, very rhythmic and in tune with nature.  The dance-like scything of the wheat, comforting and washing the dying man - following the stages and patterns of nature - shadows of our forgotten past.  Also the slightly claustrophobic, indoor feel serves to emphasize the intensity of the Russian winters.  The acting is outstanding, the costumes and music are brilliant, the staging is a masterpiece.  And the Russian railway is a power unto its own.  The lessons are timeless.  I welcome this exceptionally creative interpretation to the American film stage, and I would like to see more.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I love the [[ASIN:B006HL9G10 Insight Timer - Meditation Timer]] I downloaded from the Amazon Apps for Android store to my Samsung Galaxy s3 i9300.  It sounds just like the real thing.  Full tone quality.  Nice for space clearing, intention setting, and not having to look at the clock to see if time is up.  Great app.  Customizable with different bells to begin, end, and intervals even. Highly recommend.

0385366752|4.0|This review is for the audio CD version of Gone Girl written by Gillian Flynn and performed by Julian Whelan (Amy Elliot Dunn) and Kirby Heyborne (Nick Dunne). Gone Girl details Nick and Amy's toxic marriage and Amy's disappearance on their fifth wedding anniversary. Gillian Flynn is an incredible writer and does a great job of understanding the human physche and shortcomings. I enjoyed this novel although I would have had a harder time finishing the book if I hadn't been listening to the audio version because it dragged on in spots. The excellent character voice choices added to the story and helped push it through the slow spots. I really liked the story but the ending was anti climatic. I would recommend this book to fans of psychological thrillers and other Gillian Flynn novels
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this app extremely easy to use. I use to balance my checkbook mostly but it serves my purpose well.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|Because I don't wear it often, the time needs to be reset when I where it because there is no motion to keep it going.  That is no fault of the watch, just that it sits on the dresser all the time.
B000B589JI|5.0|(I have added some photographs above)<br /><br />I wanted this because one day at work in a field miles away from anyone with a few hours left to work my zippo ran out with no other way of lighting my smoke (did not want to start a fire with fire starter).<br /><br />When this item arrived I was suprised how big it is (thicker than a finger). This is a good thing as it carrys a good refill worth of fluid.<br /><br />The small loop I changed soon as it arrived to a same size snap style same as the large one that comes with it.<br /><br />The rubber sleeve only holds one flint that is kinda hard to get out but it does comeout eventually, the small metal disc works well.<br /><br />I checked the leaking issue some have had (even had a tap washer ready) but it didnt leak check yours.<br /><br />The words will wear off soon as the container will be in my work pack.<br /><br />The canister unscrews seperating base and pour nozzle for filling (thats where larger seal ring is) the pour nozzle also has a screw on cap with a tiny rubber ring insert. The top screw on lid is the actual canister atachment to the loop.

1449410243|4.0|i read the oatmeal's stuff online so i knew what i was getting into.<br /><br />what kept this from getting a % star rank was the poster. the way it's packaged into the book created creases in the posters that wont go away. it wouldn't be that bad, but the color has started to fake off on those creases

0525478817|5.0|If you are familiar with John Green then you may know he is one half of Vlogbrothers, an online project with a huge fan base.  He is a New York Times Best Selling and Printz award winning author of Looking For Alaska; An Abundance of Katherines; Paper Towns; Will Grayson, Will Grayson; and most recently A Fault in Our Stars.  I must admit it took me a couple of months after hearing all the hype about John Green and A Fault in Our Stars before I finally gave it a chance.  I was a little wary of it first; thinking that it wouldn't live up to all of the hype.  I was wrong. It lived up to it all and more!<br /><br />Green's writing style is certainly unique and different from anything I have ever read before.  He has a way with making what would be a sad and serious story into something light and humorous, while still keeping all the heartfelt moments in all the right places.  His characters are such a delight to get to know.  The two main characters, Hazel and Augustus, talk in such clever and insightful prose that you can't help but to fall in love with them.  He doesn't overdo the sarcastic remarks by the characters or go overboard with the humor, and he gets the amount of drama and sappy moments just right.<br /><br />I could tell from the very beginning of this book that this was not like any other. It is not just a cancer book or a love story but a story about life and all aspects of it from friends, love, family, surviving and death.  It will ask the thought provoking questions such as - Will you leave a mark on this world? What will become of those you leave behind? And is love worth the pain? It will leave you thinking about it long after you have finished the book.<br /><br />Overall I thoroughly enjoyed reading A Fault in Our Stars.  It was witty, insightful, heartfelt and such a joy to read.  I recommend it for all ages young and old.  If you're a parent you will adore this book, share it with your kids you will have something new and wonderful to bond over.If you're a teenager you'll love talking about it with your friends. It demands to be given a chance!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am not one to usually give a series like this a chance, but I did and am glad to have watched.  There is great acting throughout the series and for someone who usually has a very low tolerance for anything with a British accent, I really enjoyed this.  Maggie Smith, playing the Dowager (what ever a dowager is) is absolutley one of the best parts of the show.  Her sniper like wit is a welcome twist of realism into the royal atmosphere in which the Crawley family lives.  We purchased season three and anxiously await the release of the next season.  Positive marks aside, I still won't be rushing to watch anything with Hugh Grant in it anytime soon.
B00ALCBTWU|1.0|First off, I didn't know this was based on a video game and was sucked in by the actors involved - it is sad to see Jurgen Pronchow and Sizemore reduced to doing something like this.  I love war movies, but I had to keep fast forwarding through this one just praying it would eventually end - one of the worst researched and poorly made WWII flicks I've seen in a looooong time.  The camera work is excellent, but aside from that, this movie is a complete train wreck.<br /><br />Here's the short list; the makers admitted they had a limited budget - if so, hire lesser named actors and make a better movie.  The vast majority of the helmets worn in this movie are plastic and fiberglass, and it shows; they don't fit well, they look like plastic, and they bounce all over the place - not to mention, most of the Germans are wearing WWI \\"Coal Scuttle\\" helmets for some reason, not WWII helmets.  They also only had a few German uniforms for the hundreds of suicidally stupid German soldiers who mindlessly run headlong into machine gun fire over and over again.  To make up for this, they simply put the Germans in E. German overcoats (almost all of them) to disguise the fact they don't have uniforms.  The main \\"bad guy\\" German in the flick is an enigma, as he wears an Army Oberst's uniform with a Luftwaffe pilot's badge as his only breast decoration, yet he also has the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, and he's wearing an Army cap with a Luftwaffe wreath on it and an SS eagle sewn over that - and his overcoat has an SS eagle on the sleeve - that's some serious research!  Likewise, his adjutant wears a Heer lieutenant's uniform with an SS officer's visor cap throughout.  And all of the \\"SS\\" troops have Heer decals on their helmets.  In one scene, they go to an opera house, where this officer's box is festooned with Fuhrer Standards and the outside of the building has them all over the place as well - guess they thought they looked pretty.  And, of course, everything touched by the Germans has a swastika on it, just like in the 1940's movies - regardless of whether it's a truck, a box, a pack of cigarettes, and yes, even brick buildings (no lie, the secret German factory has multiple large white swastikas just painted randomly all over the brick walls) have big swastikas painted on them so you won't get confused.<br /><br />The American stuff is equally bad - the uniforms and equipment are terrible.  One reviewer mentions the German G43 sniper rifle a GI is using, but he doesn't mention it's a POS rifle with a modern hardware store scope on it and a homemade mount and the barrel is missing its sights - even the rifle is a piece of junk.  There's only seven or eight GI's really in this movie, but even at that, one's carrying a British .303 Enfield, one appears to be carrying a CZ24 bolt-action Mauser-type rifle, and the others all have Thompsons - and every German is equipped with an MP40, across-the-board, all of which have endless magazine capacity.  Oh, but let's not overlook the German machine-gun team at the beginning of the flick, that for some reason is using a WWI Austrian water-cooled HMG.<br /><br />There are a number of very poorly disguised Russian T-34 tanks in this movie which are garbed up and painted gray to look like godknowswhat, but they don't look like anything in particular and I imagine they were borrowed from another movie given the budget these guys had.  Problem here too is they are identified as the \\"12th Waffen SS Panzer Division\\" which played a very small part in the Ardennes Offensive and, as stated, everybody in the 12th SS in this movie is wearing regular German army uniforms and despite being the Hitler Jugend Division, these guys all look like they're in their forties.  When they do close ups on the tanks, it gets worse, as you can see they're missing the hull mounted machine guns, have rust streaks all over them, and they're in terrible condition - they look like they've been sitting on a Hungarian back lot for ages.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, if you can call it that, is simply absurd and the dialogue is absolutely terrible - a teenager could've written a better and more believable movie.  I've only played a couple of WWII video games on a couple of occasions, but I came away from those experiences much more impressed than I was with this movie.<br /><br />Don't be sucked in by the big names involved, this movie is a disaster and it'll end up in my next garage sale or thrift store donation.es.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, if you can call it that, is simply absurd and the dialogue is absolutely terrible - a teenager could've written a better and more believable movie.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A work of hope and love buried beneath atrocity. The characters are your neighbours , you are distraught when they are taken from you. One of the best, if not the absolute best books I have ever read.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There have been tons of reviews on this movie so I'll not add to the list of details others have already laid out.  This is not my typical type of movie, but I watched it because a friend recommended it and I was blown-away impressed.  It is beautifully made, the story is superb, the acting is top-drawer, and this may be one of Tim Burton's best films - ever.  I'm really surprised this one hasn't gotten more acclaim than it has.  Well worth buying; it's in the same category as Forrest Gump and Second Hand Lions in my opinion, so if you liked those movies, you will love this flick.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Superb art design, beautiful songs and interpretation.<br />The story though was so summarized that only these who read the complete work of Hugo could understand the so dramatic plot.
B005603236|4.0|As a fan of Masterpiece Theatre's English literary gems, I found this product a good one, but it doesn't compare to their wonderful Pride & Prejudice.  The film was well-done and I would recommend it to those who love Jane Austen.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|This is a good product at a good price, and I have only a few criticisms of it.  1. Its doesn't have a 78 RPM speed.  2.  The feature that is supposed to detect the breaks between songs on vinyl LP's and record each song seperately does not work.  This requires the operator to sit there during the process and begin each new song manually.  Other than those issues, it's very nice to put my old vinyl onto my PC.
B006B9TLT0|5.0|this was a gift and was a big hit. while listening with my niece, the music on it is quite good.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|While I enjoyed the Zombie Survival Guide, I guess I was hoping for more.  Just a few more anecdotes and it would've felt a little less like a Wikipedia entry for Zombies.  That being said, I enjoyed the book and would still recommend it.  At least it gives you some food for thought (Brains!!!).

B0066WJLU6|5.0|I have not had a reason to really need this yet; I really can't speak to battery drain or anything, but this thing is certainly BRIGHT! You can pick the color of the light - obviously, white is the brightest - and I'm glad to know it's on my Kindle, since I tend to panic when it's pitch dark!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's also fairly reliable.  I will say that when mere minutes matter here in tornado country, it is NOT the fastest resource to get the weather news.  I stick with my local news station's app, Channel 16 WAPT-TV.  I think this is the link for it--  [...]  Other than that, with normal weather conditions and with slow-moving fronts, the paid version of Weather Live is great. It is certainly one of the most beautiful apps on my Kindle.

B000N6U0VU|3.0|It was in great condition. Just what the seller described but the only down part was that it was not mentioned that it was a UK Version. So I can't play it on my tv. I can ONLY watch it on my laptop.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Do keep it plugged in to the charger if you use it in &#34;nightstand&#34; mode, because it sucks the power.  Other than that, it doesn't use that much power in &#34;sleep&#34; mode, wherein the alarm still works.  it's just a good little back-up alarm clock for me (I need FOUR to get me going in the mornings!).  I enjoy having the thumbnail weather, too. I have yet to use the sleep timer, so cannot comment on that.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My father in law recommended the Reacher series to me. He reads a lot of books and he usually has great taste in books. He also turned me on to the Mitch Rapp (Vince Flynn) series which I have also thoroughly enjoyed. I am a research scientist by trade, so when I get a chance at the end of the day to get away from chemistry, biology, labs, test tubes, lectures, and two demanding babies when I get home, I like to lose myself in a good book. I thought The Killing Floor was a good read. Yes I agree with the critics that the coincidence of him showing up at that place at that time was a difficult thing to swallow. But it was his only real mistake in the book. I found the charters to be well thought out and believable. I found the descriptions of the characters, scenes, and backgrounds of the characters to be far above par for most writers. I am currently reading Jack Reacher #2 Die Trying and I am enthralled by it. I highly recommend The Killing Floor for anyone who likes action novels. Another great thing about finding this series at this time is that there are fifteen or so more books to go. And I love a series that follows a main character like thi one does.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My marriage was all in this book. I related with every chapter. Although I have a good marriage their were many things I took from each chapter that I know I can incorporate in my everyday to make my marriage better.<br />LOVED IT
B001B3MCQK|5.0|After watching the documentary, \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\", in my English class, I couldn't get \\"Sugar Man\\" and \\"I Wonder\\" out of my head. Rather than buying the soundtrack for the movie, I decided to go out on a limb and purchase this album, and now I am more than happy I did. Every song on this album is amazing, and I highly suggest that everyone owns a copy.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were great reads! Interesting and appropriate for most age groups! Suzanne Collins is a phenomenal author. Look forward to the next great trilogy!
B000MLNUBI|2.0|I bought this watch a few years ago. I definitely loved its looks, people would often come to me asking questions about it and commenting about how different it looks. Unfortunately, it only worked properly for three years, the mechanism got damaged somehow. I was really disappointed, tried to have it fixed but it was not worth considering the asking price for the job. Had I bought a cheap plastic Swatch, I would not have cared much when it broke, but I paid quite a significant amount of money for this one, so you could expect it to last for 5 to 10 years tops. Anyway, I will probably not buy any watch from Swatch again.
B00138JAI6|5.0|If you're looking for one and only one MIngus album, then this is probably the one.  It's polished, recording is clean and every song is a winner.  Mingus is an absolute genius.  I had to listen to it a bunch of times before I really got it, but once I did, this became the ultimate jazz album in my collection.  If you are into the more avant garde jazz then maybe this is not for you.  Mingus is smooth and comprehensible.  But bold and fresh. What else to say?  I just wish I had been alive when I could see him live and see him chase other musicians in his band around with an axe when they made mistakes.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It works but it's really too expensive for what it does.<br /><br />this should be half the price half the price
0440241901|4.0|This is definitely chick lit, but I love Sophie Kinsella and can overlook the lack of depth because she's so good at what she does.  It's been awhile since I read the &#34;Shopaholic&#34; books, but I took to Emma a little more quickly than I did Becky.  She might be hapless, but she's less self-sabotaging.  She seems like &#34;any girl&#34; - struggling through her twenties, trying to figure out what she's good at, and a little deluded about herself (who doesn't delude themselves a little, right?).<br /><br />The premise of the story - she unloads all her secrets to a &#34;stranger&#34; on the plane, who turns out to be her boss - is fine (cute, even).  The problems that she struggles with day-to-day (glory-grabbing co-workers, a painful family dynamic, and a fizzled relationship) are interesting enough to keep you reading through the first half of the book.  In the second half, I found it hard to believe that the love interest of this book finds her so interesting.  He's apparently older than her, and she's a complete mess when he meets her... I felt like the romance was kind of a 'miss'.  The peripheral characters in this book make up for the less-believable love story, however - quirky but somehow believable, like looking at your own family, roommates or co-workers through a different lens.<br /><br />It's wrapped up sort of quickly at the end, but I found myself happy with the result.  A nice read!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I really love this album. I listened to it twice. Usually, on the first listen, I don't really like an album. But this has exceeded my expectations, the songs are catchy and get stuck in your head. I love it.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is sort of like Mario Cart, with our hero<br />riding down the road avoiding all kinds of obstacles.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|The Director Cut was a good addition to the movie.  I enjoyed how the extra scenes added to the movie.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I bought the CD because I love the song Landslide and wanted to own it again.  I put the CD in and suddenly remembered just how many great songs Fleetwood Mac has that I have missed hearing.  I love Stevie's voice and all her greatest vocals are on this CD.  I love it.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend and his little son for Christmas and it was very, very well received.  Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think its nice but I don't think its my favorite.it could be a good way to teach people how to take care of horses too.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Holds my Trustfire tr3t6 pretty securely. Body of the light is approximately 1 in diameter. Seems like the elastic could easily accomodate a larger light though. Belt clip is probably the most secure point, it isn't going anywhere. It has a hook that loops under the belt - you could hang upside-down - it might drop the light, but the clip will stay put.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I love this game and I can tolerate a couple of pop up ads per hour but pop up ads have begun to appear every couple minutes. If not for this I would give this game 5 stars.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie. We received it promptly after ordering. I think its silly to have to do this. If the DVD was not OK you would have heard by now.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game.  It is lots of fun.  I have it on my iPad and wanted it on my new Kindle.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I reccomend before reading this that you at least read the novella Hanna, since this book is split between both Hanna and Lena's perspective.  About this book, I thought it was going great than it became very rushed in the last 75 pages, I felt like Oliver was trying finish it by leaving out details and create an ending that  was not an ending, nor was there any big conflict that the story was building up to.  I have to say I am dissapointed in this book because it should of been maybe longer or more time should of been spent on it to at least give it an ending.  I gave this book 3 stars only because I like that book had both Hanna and Lenas perspective.
B0012EF0WQ|5.0|A couple instrumental numbers, and all the songs are so hauntingly beatiful. David Crosby singing and playing and being the sweet soul he is.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|The story focuses on the making of Psycho and uses it to give interesting insight into Hitchcock and his wife.  If you like Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins, you'll like the movie.
B001L5VYFI|5.0|This is CSN and Y, live, doing all the songs one could love and which I have loved since their creation.  Hope and love and cries for human decency and justice.  Timeless beauty.
B000002N25|5.0|I had to replace the disc because I got careless and this rip and disc combo are a perfect combination. I was able to get the mp3 right away and the disc came in a couple of days.<br /><br />The album is a nice mix of some of his best work with a fair slice of top end country in with the mix. The songs vary but are mainly slower than some of the Knopfler albums but with real classics that just stick in the mind for days.<br /><br />This version of 'are we in trouble now' destroys the Randy Travis (who I think he wrote it for) version and Cannibals is one of my all time favorite tracks for its pace, beat and childhood memories.
0545265355|5.0|Great books, great quality, perfect cover to package or gift. This is a great series!! BUY IT! The movies are out now, so there is no reason not to love this series!
B0034CNSFU|4.0|A good mix of classic Hendrix but the quality is a little poor. I know some of the originals were not good and that doesn't help but you would think a fan would engineer them back just a little better than this.
B00COWOXGE|4.0|Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones star in this 1993 thriller<br />based on the 60's TV series. A doctor is on the run after he's<br />falsely accused of murdering his wife. This is a great film<br />and Ford & Jones are terrific in it. This Blu-ray has nice<br />picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It is pretty awful from a plot perspective although if you grew up in the 80's it is a very pleasant way to spend a saturday afternoon with a few beers remembering the glory years.<br /><br />Lots of violence, tongue in cheek humor and enough references to the stars respective movies that it helps you to remember to hire them for another watch, which is probably why it was made.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is a great product for sudoku fans.  It provides all the tools for making play enjoyable, including provisional numbers.
B008I34YYY|5.0|The film makers here clearly set out with a goal, and nailed it.  It's not for everyone, but if you like it, you'll love it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|No commercials! Most recent season! LOVE IT! Might consider signing up for the premium version...<br />Will be back for more!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent story, slightly restores my faith in humanity. Alludes to a time when we had a commander in chief who cares about the military. Screw the god damned liberal media as well!!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I just finished this book for the second time.  So many thoughts of growing up, wondering how some people just finally snap from all the mean-spirited things they are subjected to.  A fascinating read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to plat until the ads start. I don't mind having ads that support the game but these pop up in the middle of playing very annoying
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it in two days.  Maybe now I will go to sleep!  A real good read.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three movies and extras for 35 dollars on blu ray?!  Sign me up!  You don't get digital copies but for this price who cares?
B00797MB0O|2.0|Charlize is WAY better than this.  Stupid movie, I wouldn't waste my time if I were you.  It's really bad. Truly. Awful.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Yummy sound for my ears.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great with standard ear pads<br />Love the screw on 1/4&#34; adapter<br />Coiled cable stays neat<br /><br />Cons:<br />None so far<br /><br />Thanks!<br />A

B0002HZHXG|5.0|Excellent.  Bruder is a good tough product for kids.  The lights flashing and siren brought much joy to my 2 year old grandson.  It works very well.  Ordered two (2) sets.
014305841X|5.0|This book provides a lot to think about when it comes to one of our most essential actions - eating.  It's a good size book, but a wealth of information and things to think about.  My brother isn't a reader, so I bought him the audio verson and he loved it also.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Besides the perfect voice casting, including Sara Silverman! What a surprise! Having seen her act. I thought to myself really? But gladly i could not have been more wrong. She was perfect!<br />I thought the story was sweet, and hopeful! It sends a good message to kids and adults alike. that no matter what, we are not, and don't have to been alone. And that even if we run into \\"Glitches\\" in our life, we all have a purpose. We all have a niche. And that friendship, love and loyalty are more important then how can I get over this person to get ahead.<br />Disney has done it again..............have a feeling there will be a Wreck-it-Ralph 2 in the works. If not, there should be.<br />And if I had a daughter, I'd want her to be just like Pen! With those same sweet eyes.....just not as animated..LOL!
B00AF6B22E|4.0|The story was good, acting was great, the point of what the pilot's life was like was over shown. Not the alcohol and drug abuse just the whole picture of his life.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This is a great story and as always Helen Hunt is fantastic.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great movie.
1616960922|5.0|I went into this book with high expectations. He surpassed even those. It doesn't last long, however it is an exceptionally well written story. I didn't put it down once until I finished it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing story about an amazing life. Soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen alike will love and relate to slot of this book. I know I did. Rest in peace brother.
B004GTKP3S|4.0|This series is probably the closest to &#34;real life&#34; at the time, with gossips, social expectations and unexpected deaths. Was really happy with the costumes and imagery, nothing was &#34;updated&#34; for modern tastes in a major way.  Excellent and entertaining, with some really top-notch actors!
B000092Q4U|5.0|This album kick major ass.. One of their best albums. Actually its my fav from them.. Looking to buy Resolution
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Purchased this APP a while ago and it has been pretty good on my kindle fire. I like the timeframes it gives for movies, Skype, web use. This is a good for anyone who does like to know how much battery life u have to do the things u love on the kindle.
0446554995|4.0|Everything I've come to expect from a Pendergast thriller: Holmesian deductions, impeccably described impeccable apparel, a few twists & turns. A fun read if you're a fan of the series; if you're jumping in here, stop, go back to The Relic, and work your way up.
B008M721MS|5.0|I downloaded it to my kindle fire HD and it worked i also did the same with my computer.SKYPE TOTALLY ROCKKKSS
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's a PS3 controller. Nothing fancy, works well, charges fine, works from across the room. Everything I expected, and nothing more.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick read as it kept me engaged throughout. Great characters, good story line and left me wanting a little more when finished. Good book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like this as app because it gives me something to do in my down time.  Also, I am really glad that this does not need internet (though I don't know why it would....) this way I can play it anywhere and anytime I want.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show!  The sets!  The characters! (Well MOST of them)  The props and the castle are amazing!  The only thing I don't' care for is they don't keep real time on the show.  During the 1st show, it is stated that Bates, who started on the first show had now been there two years.  I don't' like the feeling of we missed something.  I wish they would have showed some of Sybil's season, but they skipped right over it never showing them leaving, but already coming back.  And I wish it flowed better between scenes.  Its pretty choppy even with the uncut versions.  But it is my favorite show on right now and I would highly recommend it to anyone... and have!
B00AWE9TCE|5.0|This is an excellent set for any LEGO fan. The set is great overall, but the things that make it cool are the minifigs, design, and the play features.<br /><br />First, the minifigs. The minifigs included are great, it comes with three of them: Equila (Obviously, since the vehicle is his) Eglor, and Wilhurt. Equila and Eglor are eagles that are trying to protect the CHI crystals that animal tribes are fighting over in the story of this LEGO theme, and Wilhurt is a wolf that is aiming to steal their CHI. Though Equila can be found in a few other sets, Eglor and Wilhurt are currently exclusive to this set (Though they will be released in later sets). All of the minifigs are designed well, and their heads are double-printed, one facial feature for each side. However, from what you see when the animal head is put on, the eyes are the only difference, but the faces are still a nice touch. The minifigs come with their own individual weapons, and the coolest part is that Equila and Eglor have posable, well-sized wings that are placed on the studs on the back of their CHI harnesses. However, this means that you cannot have the minifigures without the harness and keep the wings for a, \\"Casual,\\" feeling to your minifigs without making moderations, but it doesn't bother me that much and I don't see how it affects them that much.<br /><br />Now, the design of the set. The vehicle is designed in somewhat the form of an eagle. You can make out feathers, a head, a beak, and even some talons in the front, which are posable all except for the middle talon. The vehicle uses tracks to maneuver as can be seen on the box, and though they're not my preference for LEGO vehicles, they move well and they give the set a nice look. The missiles may stick out a bit, but they blend in really well, actually, and if they bother you they're easily removable. These missiles also have little pieces on the top to round out the firing mechanism, so that's a nice touch too. The wings these missiles aremounted on can be moved up and down, presumably for aiming the missiles. The set itself is not flimsy at all, but sometimes when using the wing it may slightly come out of place. However, this is a LEGO product, of course, and all you have to do to fix it is put it back in place using light force. Also, you can see some CHI on the, \\"wings,\\" of the vehicle, and they're connected to the body of the vehicle by a tube, hinting that the CHI is powering the vehicle (As that is one of its primary purposes). There's also a wheel in the back for stability, but it's sort of covered up by another few pieces, and half the time I see this set I forget about it. The interior of the cockpit is very detailed, and the set as a whole has lots of detail and is a great touch to the set (As long as you don't hate messing around with stickers sometimes)<br /><br />The playability is one of the great things about this set. Aside from posable talons, moving tracks, and missiles, you also get a neat ejection mechanism, which can easily be activated by pushing down a button near the hidden wheel in the back. Some force may be needed to push this out, but not so much that a young child can't push it out. The wings on the sides of the cockpit can open up, giving the escape vehicle the ability to, \\"fly,\\" and the back even has a few translucent-red studs, sort of like little thrusters helping the vehicle take off. The cockpit opens up and rests on a little LEGO square plate that has a sticker on it, which makes it look like the studs on top of the windshield of the vehicle can actually rest perfectly on it. However, it does rest at a slight angle on this plate. One thing that bothers me is that when placing Equila in the cockpit, though he fits with his wings and there's even a space for the wings to be placed, you must remove the wings to close the windshield of the cockpit. However, instead of just placing these aside and have them waiting to get lost, you can put them on the wings of the vehicle as another design. In fact, if you look closely on the box, you can see that they did just that. You don't need to worry about having to study the box to find where exactly to put the wings either, as the instructions will show you where.<br /><br />All in all, there are very few cons for this set, none that can easily be forgotten or fixed in no time at all. The only reason not to get it would be that you don't have the money.
B00821OW8K|5.0|The positive reviews apply. I just wanted  to leave my 5 stars.<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend to a friend and buy again.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The acting was fine, concept was different , made for an interesting viewing. Bruce was the same character he always plays.
B000BX4B1U|5.0|Fantastic, underrated solo CD from one of the big talents from Take That. Just a shame this didn't sell due to the TT reunion, making it a costly collectible, rather than a classic album. Anyone who loves the Circus or Beautiful World Take That albums will enjoy this, as Mark Owen sings in a familiar style, adding his own unique twist.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty McCreery is an amazing artist. artist. His voice is something you'd think was coming from a man in his late twenties or early thirties. Very polished and professional for such s young man. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes country music. Great purchase.

B0067R0APK|4.0|But I agree with others: why have a Sale! label the app store and even the device icon?  Hopefully only temporary.

0062014536|5.0|Everything comes crumbling down in the Delirium trilogy's explosive finale.<br /><br />The government that declared love a disease, amor deliria nervosa, is taking action against the Invalids by sending regulators into the Wilds to stamp out rebellion and ward off infection. Lena and the other rebels are being hunted but know they must fight back to knock down the walls in this oppressive society. But the fight has taken its toll on Lena. She's less concerned about who she loves and instead questions her doubt in the cure: “I am no happier than I was when I believed that love was a disease.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lena's best friend, Hana Tate, sounds off in alternating chapters, transporting the reader out of the Wilds and returning them into the sanctioned city of Portland, Maine where Hana lives a life cured of the disease Hana is set to marry the newly inaugurated mayor, Fred Hargrove, but questions the boy she was paired with while investigating the disappearance of his defective ex-wife. Hana's also hiding something that surges the tension of Lena's inevitable return to Portland.<br /><br />Characters missing from Pandemonium return; some hardened as Lena was trained to be, others punished inside Portland for sympathizing. Lauren Oliver pulls no punches and suffuses this book with high stakes, casualties of war, betrayals, and a formidable resistance to conclude the trilogy on a high note.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is beast<br />I picked the rating because it was amazing<br />The book subvert interesting I haven't finished a book in 2 years but the book motivated me to keep going
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My kid loves this DVD and watches it all the time.. the only draw back is that you have to select the movie from the menu and it doesnt just play back to back. Other then that pretty good!
B00181JGI2|5.0|This is movie is great!  Reminds me of [...] Howie Weener Unclogged.  It is original and hilarious in so many ways.  John Goodman deserved an Oscar.  Right up there with the greatest comedic performances of all-time.  Dude!  It is a tremendously quotable movie..............\\"I've got a beverage here\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This can be addictive! I like that it makes you think. There are many levels ranging from easy to difficult.
B002361MLA|5.0|On so many levels!  Many quotes are included in [...] Howie Weener Unclogged.  The Power of Now is one of the foundational books for Mind/Body.  How you think is how you'll feel, and visa versa!  Thank you!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|All kinds of issues if accidently click on a picture.  Have to click the back button about a thousand times just to get back to the main screen.  There is an app called full facebook that works much better.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This is an interesting slant on, and up-date an old tale. Very entertaining and the only one--so far--of this genre to be a success.<br />With its use of CGG it is fun entertainment.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|What an outstanding combination.  Joe and Beth together, wow!  I hope they decide to do more music that couples her voice with his guitar.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|A very well done story of the coming together of the Avengers. Lots of action and great CG graphics to enhance the action.<br />It also does well in giving each of the characters their time to develop their part in the group and the story a a whole.<br />Great action fun!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I got it at a great price, arrived on time and everything plays well. no issues so I can't complain. Very happy with my purchase!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a fun game. you have to make sure your horse is healthy. I love this game very much. its very easy to play too.
B0058SNI5S|5.0|These fit true to size. Whereas, another pair of crocs that I have run large. I ordered a size down, they were too small, I used the Amazon exchange program - it was super easy! I ordered the right size and they are like heaven. Signature crocs comfy fit. And these are really cute too. I'm 18 weeks pregnant and I'm going to need cute comfy shoes for when I start to get bigger and my feet swell up. I think my sister-in-law had this same pair when she was pregnant and she looked pretty darn happy in these shoes! :)
B003YT5TGE|1.0|Netflix didn't have it, so Amazon was the next choice. Well I was so happy that Amazon actually had this movie and didn't mind paying $3.99 for an HD quality. We watched it on a Samsung smart TV, directly plugged to the modem, and it wouldn't load at first. It did play after we had restarted it. However, that loading yellow circle, which you can also see on this site, was right in the center throughout the whole movie. It was really annoying. I don't think I'll ever rent a digital movie from Amazon again.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This is fun but could be so much better! The Kindle Fire HD version is so inferior. No bonus word choices? No badges? Less fun! Fix this and I'll get the paid version.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is better then the last I didn't want it to end!! I can't wait for June 4th to come and the next one to be released. Read the first two in less than one week. Awesome books!!!
B004132HZS|5.0|BBC's programing puts American Televison to shame a large chunk of my favorite shows are on BBC. It started with Doctor Who such great programming. Season One of Sherlock is awesome have not watched season 2 yet.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|You make it your mission to rid your nation of its most shameful human rights violation. While fighting a war to achieve that goal, you're simultaneously trying to pass legislation in furtherance of that goal. What if you fail?<br /><br />  Abraham Lincoln (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) has brought the south to the edge of defeat in The Civil War but has yet to pass the thirteenth amendment which will outlaw slavery and involuntary servitude. He feels that he can't end the war without first passing the amendment. His cabinet, in contrast, feels they will not be able to pass the amendment if they are not trying to end the war. His Secretary of State, William Seward (played by David Strathairn) tells him that peace and the amendment are mutually exclusive. Debates among congressmen rage on the floor on a constant basis with arguments in favor of abolition being voiced by Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens (played by Tommy Lee Jones) and arguments opposing abolition coming from Fernando Wood (played by Lee Pace) and George H. Pendleton (played by Peter McRobbie). Behind the scenes, operative William N. Bilbo (played by James Spader) is constructing backroom, and in some cases backwoods, deals that will ensure anyone who may vote for the amendment will and anyone who won't will abstain. As far as any struggles Abraham Lincoln is dealing with in his home life, his son, Robert Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), has abandoned studies at Harvard to join the Union army. His mother, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Sally Field) is foursquare against the idea of her son going to war, as she is still dealing with the loss of two sons. Edward Baker Lincoln who died in 1850 and William Wallace Lincoln who succumbed to typhoid fever one year prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.<br /><br />  I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this movie. Some actors simply play themselves while answering to different names and others disappear into a role. Where Bruce Willis is the former, Daniel Day-Lewis is most definitely the latter. Makeup or no, this is not an actor's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, this is a brilliant man transforming himself into the most courageous politician this country's ever known. Likewise, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a man even more devoted to the cause of abolishing slavery but far less concerned with matters such as tact and courtesy steals every scene he is in. There is no justification for foregoing this movie for this long but, if you haven't seen it yet, you should. It is brilliant.ruce Willis is the former, Daniel Day-Lewis is most definitely the latter.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|In like this app and will use make use of the sleep timer. But, it would be nice if it didn't stop when one switches Windows. I sometimes put on a photo slideshow at the same time as I drift off to music. You can't do both with this app.<br /><br />Also, I can't find anything that explains nightstand mode.
B008VO3PA4|2.0|I thought that this book was going to be hilarious.  I bought it and was thoroughly disappointed.  There are a few funny parts, but it just wasn't a great book for me.
6302181569|5.0|This one I have been trying to find locally but with no luck and was so happy to have found it one line. If you are a sci fi fan this is one for your library. Great copy like new.
0307744434|5.0|I loved \\"The Night Circus!\\"  It kept me awake several nights as I tried to race to the end.  Having read it, I can say I will read it again some day.  The characters were so real and I loved them all - well, almost all.  If you haven't read this, or if you are trying to figure out what to read next, choose this book!  It is one of the best stories I have read in a while!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love to read and have always loved the books more than the movies (generally speaking)....they always have so much more detail and 'little stories' within the story. I also like to read the book BEFORE I watch the movie, however that did not happen this time. So I was worried that I would not be able to 'get into it' … well I was wrong. The book was great and still kept my attention. I'm so glad I read it.....now on to the second book!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I understand that Josh wants to try new things, a different direction.  But it's true:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  None of these songs feature his magnificent, booming baritone.  He's trying to be a tenor and it doesn't work.  If you're expecting songs in the vein of Alejate, Gira, and Broken Vow, you won't find them here.  Half the songs are written by Josh, but he has a long way to go in that area.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|So well written that the characters come to life before your very eyes.  You know each of the major characters intimately, which is not often found in books I have read.  There was no rush to build the plot. It was  allowed to evolve at a pace that encouraged the reader to enjoy the tense buildup.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|over the top!  the most talented group of artists ever to be together!  i try to see them in person whenever they tour!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game sucks on Kindle Fire. It will not open to play, after a certain point it just downloads and closes after once it's done downloading. I don't know what it's downloading but that's all it does. 70MB here and close, 126MB there and close, and it just keeps doing this for Hours! I deleted this after 3 hours of downloading and closing. WASTE OF TIME FOR KINDLE FIRE USERS!!!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Couldn't put this book down it was very creepy and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Cannot wait to read her next book.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|i got this app cause my friend had it on her fire. It is a great game but after a few days it would not let me on. It is worth the money though :)
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Definitely back to basics.  I loved the original Underworld.  Evolution was a great exploration.  Rise of the Lycans was really good and I loved the backstory on Lucian.  This movie held up to the world that Len Wiseman created with the first one.  I know that they said this was it, but they left it open... :)<br /><br />The only complaint I had was the same one that everyone seemed to have when it was in theatres--it could have been longer and I would not have complained.  However, if I like a movie, I always say that.  :)
B005G5PPGS|5.0|A most enjoyable tale if you are deeply into baseball.  And full of great working material for mavericks whatever your area of activities.  A great story.  A great workbook for thinking and managing outside the box.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This is it: if you ever needed proof of Jared Leto's ability to act, this is it!  I had read a review on IMDb.com of this movie and the reviewer blew my mind with it so I rented it here and hoped like hell that she was right!<br /><br />She most definitely was right.<br /><br />A warning to all those who like a movie to be linear with a clear beginning, middle and end-- and no jumping back and forth between these clear three parts-- if you didn't like The Fountain or didn't want to see it, then you will not like this movie.  It will be too hard for you to keep up.  If you do like movies like these that keep you on your toes, this movie is your thing.  It starts at the end and moves along three possible life paths of what could happen when a little boy makes a choice between going with Mom on the train or staying with Dad at the station when his parents split up.<br /><br />I liked this movie so much that after I rented it, I also bought it and would recommend it to everyone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|At the end of the day...it's all about acceptance, right? Glad I hung in there for book 3..Not literary but still OK
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I always like the Transformers movies.  I've been a fan since they were a cartoon I watched in the afternoon.  I'm a fan of Shia's as long as he's in them.  I've not really seen much of his afterwards that I liked-- Indiana Jones aside-- but I did not like some of the plotline.<br /><br />The Transformers and Shia were good in this flick, though.
B00B8PQC5S|3.0|So be prepared to enjoy some, be bored by others and be absolutely appalled by the rest. I have never seen anything like some of the shorts in this film and hope I never do again. Some of the shorts I wanted to see as full feature films.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I just finished this book and I don't even have words for how much I loved it. For the record, as per my feelings about the other books in the series, I did NOT like &#34;Delirium&#34;. I kept reading because I absolutely LOVED &#34;Before I Fall&#34; and thought that Oliver could do no wrong. I was mistaken when I read &#34;Delirium&#34;, but I wanted desperately to like the series and a few comments said that I might enjoy &#34;Pandemonium&#34; even if I didn't like &#34;Delirium&#34;, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had hoped that &#34;Requiem&#34; would live up to the standards she set with &#34;Pandemonium&#34;. Lauren Oliver did not disappoint.<br /><br />I know that people are upset about the way that it ended, but let's be honest: no matter HOW it ended, SOMEONE was going to be angry. I've read a lot of poor endings of dystopian series - this was absolutely not one of them.<br /><br />My one complaint (one that I've seen frequently on these comments) was the lack of Julian in the book. He definitely needed to be seen and heard more. However, even with this complaint, I can't seem to give this book less than 5 stars. As I read the ending, I did want it to go on, of course I did, but it also felt right - that's just how the story needed to end. Props to Oliver for taking all of this criticism for letting the story stop where it needed to.<br /><br />Side note: the novellas &#34;Hana&#34; and &#34;Annabel&#34; were okay, but you MUST read &#34;Raven&#34;. Not kidding. This is one of those times where you and the author share a delicious secret and it makes you want to explode. Do it.
0451450523|5.0|This book was rich in beautiful imagery, depth of meaning, and humor.  I was tense at the climax; I had seen the movie, but forgot what happened.  (The book is much better than the movie, in my opinion.)  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to go back and read it again.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't mind sex in the story but that's all there is in this book. I like a little action also.

0062238868|5.0|Came away after reading this with a new respect for all our military and how they have to fight the wars for all of us and have to account for each move they make. What a shame Chris paid the ultimate price with his life trying to help others, I'm sure he had many more books he could have written, God bless his memory and his family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was amazing and hope that I will read a series just as great as this one by Suzanne Collins

0307454568|5.0|Very good book and just a great series!!! Must read in order as there are 3 books. Steig Larsson was an excellent writer a sad shame there aren't more of his books.And a #4 in the Millenium Series!!!

B007HC3LHS|5.0|Could not put this book down. I loved everything about it, from the characters, the story and the writing. I usually do not write a review but this book was one of my favorites and I had to. Read this book now, you will love it.
B004XQO90O|5.0|A helicopter pilot accustomed to high security defense missions is given another and very different chance to fight for the good of others. However, this mission is very different. To say more would be to ruin this movie for you.<br /><br />I can assure you that this is a wonderful action-packed film. It is also so much more. It is about the tenderness and well-meaning sentiment that I believe is in all of those who fight for our freedom. It also shows us how cold and heartless government agencies can be. It is so tenderly performed and well acted! I love this movie!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What  fantastic story lines, cast of characters, scenery, home, food, clothing!!! Is there anything NOT to like? Keep on, Julian Fellows!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|What if there was a bureau that decided the paths your life was meant to take? What would you do if you found out about them? How determined would you be if you disagreed with the path that they had chosen for you? Would you be willing to fight for the direction that YOU feel your life should take? These are the ponderous questions that are raised in The Adjustment Bureau.<br /><br />This seemingly far-fetched premise comes to life under the amazing direction and acting abilities of many talented people including Matt Damon. This movie is very convincing, and the viewer is hopelessly propelled into this imaginary world. Talk about escapism! I could watch this powerful story over and over again!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it get it f you if you hate it suck balls if you hate it get it it's the best right people  it's so cool)
B004WR125O|5.0|Not much praise that I can give this adapter except for the simple fact that it works and works smoothly. I've had no trouble connecting to my network. I was up and streaming music from Spotify in 5 minutes with no hiccups on speed or quality of connection.

B000008HPE|5.0|\\"In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.\\"
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a very fun game. Kinda easy, but good. Couldve been a little longer too. Graphics are pretty good also
B0055PGUYU|5.0|a must read, i thoroughly enjoyed every page, one of my best non-fiction, the chapter on target was very interesting, and why we always turn right after entering walmart :)..i started observing and putting some in practice..
0385360169|1.0|Book one concentrates on two basic things:  sex and stupidity.  I had a hard time finishing it, but I kept going in the hopes that a plot would emerge.  I'm sure there is a plot there, but it kept getting lost in the next disturbing sex scene.  And our heroine?  She wants so badly to please her [sick, twisted] man that she keeps agreeing to submit to his abuse until it finally starts to dawn on her that, hey!  maybe this is not healthy for me?  What a waste of money.
B003UBTX72|5.0|This is a must read for any Rolling Stones or even a rock n roll fan.  I was amazed at how small the rock n roll world is as well as by the storied Keef tells.  A great read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun to play but it has too much ads that is why it is a 4 not a 5
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I am enjoying this game so far! There are several hidden objects which I love and the story is interesting.
B006FE83U4|5.0|The dvd arrived on time and in great condition. The sound and picture quality were amazing. This was a bargain and I ordered it not too long before Valentine's day as a gift. My boyfriend loved it. I would definitely recommend.
0670023329|5.0|Unbelievable story!  I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it.  So very very sad that these camps exist and that fellow human beings are treated in such a deplorable way.  Truly an eye opener!
0385341008|5.0|Since so many reviews have already been offered, I won't describe what the book is about except in the most general terms.<br /><br />It does come pretty close to being a perfect book. What makes a \\"perfect book\\"? One that you can't easily put aside, one that creates real people as the characters, one that welcomes you back each time, one that ends satisfactorily, and most of all (for me at least) one that never pegs my BS meter.<br /><br />The mixture of horror and humor is almost perfect too. It is, after all, set in the time frame of the immediate aftermath of WW2, and the recent horrors of that war are very much a living part of the plot. Juliet's overarching story is given purpose by the stories of the Guernsey islanders that she collects for her book, their reminiscences of what happened to them during the war.<br /><br />If this had been a story I had written the ending would have been both more realistic and less romantic. It doesn't matter. My wife and I enjoyed the ending and everything that led up to it. This was a book we shared, while I read it aloud to her. I recommend it that way, for anyone who enjoys reading to someone else....
B002UXRGLG|5.0|It's nice to sit back and relax watching this dvd.Clear views and sights to places few of us get to see or experience as well.Thanks for your service
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game does take quite a long time to download.  I'm on kindle fire, it took 3 download attempts. But, in this case good things really do come for those who wait! Addictive fun for all!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this game and cannot stop playing it!  It is fast moving but still challenging, much better than regular solitare.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|I had a lot of fun building this set with my family. It comes with several character pieces which makes it great
B001FB5634|4.0|When done viewing this movie, I found myself wondering what it would be like to actually experience such a disaster, if such were to ever occur in this life-time. To survive in such conditions would be a horrendous feat, and indeed it was for these two characters.  A father's love for his son is very touching.  The reason to live is profound, although I don't know who would in such a hostile environment with little promise.<br />Buy this movie; you won't regret it. Be prepared to cry in the end, but understand there is still HOPE.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The team that Lincoln assembled to get the country through the war was amazing in the fact that there were many who were opposed to each other, Lincoln, and the war effort.  Lincoln's insights and bold actions are well represented in this book.  Almost as good as &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34;.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|He tried to cover too much.  The period from 1920 to end of the WWII is a lot of history.<br /> I found the characters and the plot had to &#34;jump&#34; along too fast and it losts some of the deep heartfelt connection I had wih the first book of the series.  Each piece of the book could have had more time to let the characters 'live the times' and instead the plot move on to another set of characters and another episode of time and history.<br /><br />Has a real good grasp of history and makes the periods come alive.  I love the time period of the 30s and 40s historically and the parts in Germany are exciting yet hard as he makes the 'historical events very real' as the characters move through.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I spent years fishing the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. After that, I delivered phone books, in cities across America. Living out of a van. Renting the occasional motel room. Making, saving more money than I ever could have hoped for, working a `regular,' nine-to-five, job.  Giving up more than a few chances, there and again, at a `normal,' life. Why? Well, I suppose, all 'in the name of freedom,' I'd say. Likely the reason Butch, Sundance, did what they did for a living...<br /><br />Which is probably  the main reason I can relate, at a deep level, to their tale. Brilliantly told, by writer, William Goldman, who won a `best screenplay' Oscar for his work here. Superbly-directed by George R. Hill.<br /><br />Ah, lest I forget: `Spoilers ahead,' I should mention. Suspend reading the rest of this piece, until finished watching film. Or go ahead and read it, if comprehensive previews and the like, don't normally obstruct your enjoyment of a movie. Fear not, either way, is my opinion. As this is one, so well-done, so beautifully-crafted film - it'd likely be impossible to 'spoil the fun.' Even were you to know each, every detail, start to finish, before viewing.<br /><br />Onward...<br /><br />What makes it so good? First...<br /><br />It began, it seems to me, almost an entire sub-genre of its own. The action film, involving the two, wise-cracking friends; who, in face of danger, make light of even the most precarious of situations. And then, despite their differences, always seem to work their way out of them. Examples? `Midnight Run.' `48 Hours.' `Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.' And a host of lesser films, like, `Tango and Cash.' Or, 'Rush Hour.' All attempt to work in the same vein, subject matter as `Butch, Sundance' - yet with a VERY few, if any, achieving its level of success. Because of this, and other reasons to which I'll come to, I'd actually go so far as to call this film, `revolutionary.' Even, 'ground-breaking.' And in a category all its own; unrivaledby its many imitators.<br /><br />Second: I'd call Hill's direction of the film, including choice of soundtrack, camera-work, etc., 'superb.' To put it mildly. Have you noticed, ever, that in a MASSIVE number of modern-day action films, the director, seems all too often, to go for a near `all out assault,' upon his audience?Attempting, in style, to mimic the subject matter about which he's filming? Metaphorically, `beating his audience over the head,' for want of a better phrase? With an often shaking, jerking of the camera, absurdly loud, continuous soundtrack, and such a stream of gunfire and `bulletry,' that he scarcely gives his audience a chance to, `catch a breath.' This not only becomes tiresome for the viewer. It also, in my opinion, diminishes any power that MIGHT be garnered from scenes that seem, by nature, to demand a more aggressive approach.<br /><br />Hill goes the opposite, 'direction.'<br /><br />Admirably, so. Using an often `static,' minimalistic movement of camera. Or, lack thereof. Allowing his characters, and his audience for that matter, `room to breathe.' He allows only, for a subdued, saddening, seemingly fatalistic theme, in terms of the principal soundtrack. Used at start, throughout, and at end, of film. Ever creeping, and foreshadowing a sense of potential sadness, or impending defeat, for want of a better term, in the viewer. A sound-theme which, incidentally, PERFECTLY matches writer Goldman's theme, in terms of script. Thus, when Hill DOES offer scenes of drama and intensity, and `ups the ante' with regard to his soundtrack, his movement of camera, etc., those scenes then take on a true, often frightening, power. Which might well be `muddied,' or lost, if the bulk of the film were `awash' with such technique.<br /><br />Excellent, controlled direction, I say.<br /><br />A word or two on the theme of Goldman's script: `Tis well-summarized, at around the 46:00 to 47:00 mark in the film. By a friend of our `heroes' - career bank robbers,Butch, Sundance. Newman, Redford, respectively. At the 46:00 mark: A friend tells the two, and I'm paraphrasing here: `You're times is past. Dead and gone. A new way of life's a coming. And if you don't change with it, mark my words - it'll be the end of you!'<br /><br />And herein lies the central conflict; and theme, which grows from that conflict. As Butch, Sundance must decide: Are we to simply `roll over,' and discard a the freedom to which we've become accustomed? Simply, because an increasingly industrialized society no longer has room for our ilk? The friends' answer to these questions: Well that has to do with their, I'd say, given my personal background, 'praiseworthy' act. Of NOT `giving in' to defacto subjugation. And, to a `new way of being,' even in the face of soul-crushing, likely insurmountable, odds.<br /><br />A word on natures of Butch, Sundance characters: They approach their work with good humor, and with, to the best of their ability, good intentions. Doing their best, NOT, to resort to violence in pursuit of money. Even going so far as, in one case, to allow a friendly guard in a train, to step 'away from the safe,' and leave his post, before using dynamite to gain access to their quarry. And again, later in film - after attempting to survive in a 'straight' way, as payroll guards, themselves - they offer a group of would-be robbers a clear chance to leave the scene of a potential crime, unharmed.<br /><br />It doesn't happen.<br /><br />As Butch, Sundance, are forced to fire upon them, to regain stolen, company funds. Important, this. In that, it is only upon attempting to `go straight,' that Butch, Sundance are drawn to extreme violence. Horrifically filmed, accentuated by director Hill. In fact, this last situation is, according to Butch, the first time he's `ever shot anyone.' Which further goes to show, regardless of the viewer's opinion on Butch, Sundance' method of supporting selves - the true villain of the story? At least, in the opinion of Goldman, our writer, and Hill, our director? ... It is a `Mr. Harriman,' a `greedy' bank owner. Who has his 'hired guns,' relentlessly on the trail of our fleeing robbers. And who is, I believe, is simply a good personification, or example, of the onslaught of increased industrialization, westward. Forcing men such as our `heroes,' who place high value upon freedom, into submission. Or, for that matter, extinction.<br /><br />Extinction, more likely.<br /><br />On the use of metaphor, in film:<br /><br />Butch, played by Newman, buys a bicycle, at one point in the story. An example of the `way of the future,' as explained by its salesman. And symbolic, perhaps, of an increased mechanization of society, as whole. The bike has enough of a charm, and lure to it, to cause Butch, to enjoy it. To take it out, `for a spin.' In a memorable scene, with song `Raindrops Keep fallin' On My Head,' playing in background. Yet in end? Just before leaving America, to continue a life of crime, and freedom it brings, in a foreign land, with his friend, and `business' partner - with and his girlfriend, along as well? He, Butch, throws bike away, yelling after it: `The future's all yours, you lousy bicycle!'<br /><br />A good, apt metaphor, indeed. With the bicycle a symbol of a type of mechanization and 'advancement' of society, rejected, by our `heroes.' That metaphor - such a simple thing - has great power here. Encapsulating script-writer, Goldman's theme: That of the inevitable destruction of freedom, by an increasingly oppressive, westward-spreading, mechanized, `grid-like,' society.<br /><br />Ah, that `grid-like' society! And how else is that depicted here, metaphorically-speaking? Well, of course! By the film's true villain, I'd say. Greedy bank-owner, Mr. Harriman. Whom we never meet, yet rather hear of, via newspaper clippings throughout the story. Yet who, as we see the `fruitage' of his work - scary, persistent, well-armed, `hired guns' on the trail of Butch, Sundance - seems a man to be reckoned with, indeed. And a villain, indicative of an oppressive, disturbingly-efficient, industrialized, `corporate,' society. That's `big business,' for you. The `polar opposite,' of Butch, Sundance; the good-natured, simple, fun-loving adherents of values of freedom. And of, perhaps, a time gone by, a dying era.<br /><br />On foreshadowing, in film:<br /><br />Katharine Ross, playing Sundance' girlfriend. She, before leaving with Butch, Sundance, to continue a life of crime in Bolivia, states, paraphrased: `I'll go with you, and I won't whine or complain. I'll help you when I can. Sowing socks, mending wounds, etc. Yet there is ONE THING I will not do. I will not watch you die.' Once in Bolivia, with Harriman's men still in pursuit, she decides to return home, to U.S. Leaving our heroes, to fend for selves. Thus, foreshadowing that which she, `will not watch.' Brilliantly done, expertly, concisely-written. With a `sleight of hand,' that might by M. Night (Dir., `Unbreakable') 'proud.'<br /><br />The poignant, sad soundtrack/theme of film, also portends and sense of possible defeat.<br /><br />Overall? One he#@ of a well-done piece of art, here. Which rivals Newman's best work, for my money. In, Hud - an even better film, in my opinion. And another `take' on the passing of one way of life, in favor of the unchecked, unbridled `onslaught,' of another. Hill's, Butch and Sundance, is superb though, to put it mildly. And the `polar opposite,' I'd say, of largely unintelligent, 'thematically-starved' movies, making up much of today's action genre. And its films which to focus upon action alone. Versus depth of character, theme, and the other good work, put forth in Hill's movie.<br /><br />Goldman and Hill's theme, by the way, 'encapsulated?' To my way of thinking, it has to do with choosing freedom as a way of life, no matter the circumstances. Though of course, some viewers may disagree with Butch, Sundance' means of working to maintain thatfreedom. Yet who could argue with their core value system? Not I, of course, given my personal background, and work history! Particularly, versus the, 'other option,' proposed to our heroes. Prison. Perhaps, portending a more 'advanced,' yet subjugated way, characterizing much of western society, today.<br /><br />Which, in my estimation treats Man, as slave, from infancy, to death. Wherein one often has a difficult time traveling from here to there, without being unnecessarily monitored, 'surveilled,' even touched, or, 'prodded.' Not facets of our 'civilized' culture, with which Butch, Sundance would likely, 'put up.' Quite the reverse, I'd 'wager.' I'm 'with' Butch, Sundance, Goldman, Hill, 'thematically-speaking,' then. As in: Give me NOT subjugation, of any sort. No matter the lure of it! Rather, no matter the inherent risks...<br /><br />I'll take freedom, instead!
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|I saw that an updated making of House of Cards was in the works, and wanted to watch again.  Fantastic series with a lot of twists and unexpected results.
B007712XAU|1.0|I ordered Seasons 1 & 2 last May and viewed it when it arrived.  I loved the series and it seemed fine but recently I watched the same Seasons 1 & 2 on the TV at my sister's in OH and I realized that the discs that I received were incomplete.  I never realized it until I saw the episodes on TV.  I was really disappointed to learn that the discs I paid for were defective.  Won't order from this vendor again!
B000067CIJ|1.0|The only good thing about this album is the picture of the chick on the front.  The covers of the songs inside are terrible and perhaps if this item was 1 cent it may be worth it.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The movie was dramatic but I didn't expect it to take the turns it did. It was more of a lesson on why not to drink and why not to lie. Will not watch again.
B004XMMSZG|1.0|It doesn't work. It won't fit on any docks and the thing isn't even made to be the right size for any ipod or iphone cable to fit on it. A total waste of time and money!!
B007PKOKTK|5.0|This movie took many fun turns, I love cartoons, would watch again. The movie is irritating but I thought it was fun.
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|I am surprised at some of the negative feedback on this album. People act shocked that Luke is singing about women and partying. The title is Spring Break... Here to Party. What did you expect?<br /><br />If you liked All My Friends Say and Country Girl (Shake It For Me), this is a similar collection of songs; A good party mix.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie didn't have enough action, it was just as intended. The participants hoped to get out with their lives, they barely did. Good movie.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game for both me and the 5yo, seems to run smoothly. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some decent, mind numbing entertainment.
B008JFUMT2|3.0|It's a commodity action flick. That part delivers: great chase scenes, great fight scenes, a few good quips, and at least a nod to one or two facts in the real world. Willis delivers a good role, this time as the father of the co-star - well, he's not the man he was 25 years ago, and there's nothing wrong with accommodating that fact.<br /><br />That said, action flicks have detached themselves more and more from any real plausibility. Like, if a helicopter started firing on mid-city building, isn't there a chance that police or whatnot might notice? Ditto that way-cool chase scene through downtown Moscow. I mean, I'd expect a blue flashing light or two, even if they'd cramp the style of our lone cowboy hero type. And that spray-can that confers magic immunity to radiation - uh, yeah, right.<br /><br />Classics like [[ASIN:B0039HR5QS Three Days of the Condor]] (1975) seem positively somnolent when compared to this adrenaline rush. They also appealed to thinking viewers - apparently an extinct breed, if this is any indication.<br /><br />So, it's a great guns'n'chases movie. For better or worse, that's all it is.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B0085RQLXK|2.0|After listening to this cd I cannot recall one song. No great hooks. Nothing will ever top &#34;Toys in the attic.&#34; Now THAT record had hooks!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I love this movie its got a great story line about about a young  up and coming drug rep from Phizer and a beautiful young lady (Anne Hathaway) who has Parkinsons . They fall in love and its just beautiful.
B006HL9G10|1.0|when I saw this FAOTD, I almost got it without thinking twice. Fortunately I decided to check the permissions required. Account controls? Really!  I'll pass on this one. thanks. highly suspicious.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Excellent ... This presentation of James Bond lives up to all the hype and is definately worthy of being amongst the BEST Bond movies to date
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Never heard of The Piano Guys till I saw their show on NPR - immediately ordered this CD.  Seldom do I buy a CD that DOES NOT have a song or two that I don't like.  A lot of classical music just leaves me 'nerved out', for some reason.  Not these renditions!  Enjoyed all of these, hope I can catch a concert - the Guys bring entertaining, classical music flair to the modern stage.  Going to play this on long trips so I can stay awake and 'be-bop' down the highway!
B0029XFN8A|4.0|excelente edición en bluray de esta buenísima película, totalmente recomendada, la calidad de sonido y video son muy buenas, y el precio también
B00AREIAI8|2.0|He isn't like my Frank, but he is close. Good realistic app entertaining and as soon as I write twenty words I'm have tree purple gems with is a rip of and I don't like the fact it takes so long to do EVERYTHING five mine max wait time is still too much.
0811877485|1.0|As mentioned by others, there is a very large crease in the middle of the butterfly and caterpillar, and even after I put on the wall the crease is very visible after 2 weeks.  BUT the worst part about these decals is that they do NOT stick very well and are constantly falling off!  I had to get additional spray adhesive to make them stick better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I myself like to ply this one at nite before I go to bed it makes me tried and it is a lot of fun to play when eve you like to
B002JVWQSW|5.0|One of the best tv series ever.  I started watching it midway through the 4th season.  Now I'm going back to see what I missed in the earlier years. The cast and writers are excellent.  Hilarious, fresh, sharp, and love how Jay's soft side is occasionally seen.  This dvd series is a keeper.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a lot of fun the kids really enjoy this game they say it is a little different than the other games they play
B007K3JCAE|1.0|This movie has Ultraviolet with FLIXTER - NOT ITUNES. It is a proprietary, Requires you to have their DRM-infested app to play back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Above pretty much sums it up. BEST. GAME. EVA!!!!! YOU PEOPLEZ GOTS TO GET THIS GAME!!! I DON'T KNOW HOW I EVER LIVED WITHOUT IT!!!! PLEASE GET THIS GAME AND REVIEW IT WITH GREAT WORDS OR DO NOT REVIEW IT AT ALL!!!!!!
B005LAII12|5.0|Good movie, Some pretty funny parts, Would recommend. Good Price and was shipped quickly. I would recommend this vendor and will order again.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|This is the best Krokus album in the whole history of the group. It is a new sound for them. Quality recording makes it even better.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.  They are the perfect size to fit in their hands and hold in their mouth and adorable.  I only wish you could replace the pacifier - we had a dog who liked to chew them!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The best PC components are the ones you don't have to think about. I haven't had to give PC cooling another thought since I installed this thing. It's probably a little excessive for my cooling needs but at the price, why not?
0446554995|3.0|I have read every Preston/Child collaboration as well as all of their individual work, and their collaborative genius has continued to denigrate to \\"just average\\" over the past few books, especially their recent trilogy.<br /> Two Graves does tie up some loose ends from Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance (I thought Fever Dream was the best of the 3 for action) but Two Graves seemed to be less focused on suspenseful action than the others. There is a general story line, and then two sub-story lines are included. Unfortunately, these two do not support the main story line and just add to the jumbled activities going on throughout the book.<br />I did enjoy the development of the story behind the murders, and the resulting investigative activity. However, some of Agent P's \\"escapes\\" during the story seem very \\"off the wall\\" and almost Superhero-like, and the resolution of the good versus evil encounter near the end was one of those \\"are you kidding me?\\" moments.<br />Agent P's brooding during the early part of the book was overdone as well, and did NOT seem in character.<br />Overall, a very average offering. One would be better served getting this on loan from the library or purchasing it on the secondary market.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We came in to Downton Abbey on Masterpiece at the very end of Season Two and then watched Season Three. This DVD set allowed us to experience the series from the begining. The inclusion of the Christmas Special, which was not shown, filled in the last of the blanks. This set is perfect for anyone wanting to find out why this series is so popular and for anyone wanting to start it all over again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Sounds good for kids. The bad thing is you start 10 games. You have to buy the other games with your points.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|All you need do is listen! There never will be another. The clarity of the sound makes it sound like it was just recorded. My favorite, \\"Hear My Train A Comin\\" :(
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Awesome, my wife and I really enjoyed it! It doesn't get any better than this, loved it! Every episode left you in suspense, we couldn't get enough.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very good addictive game. This game has very realistic graphics. You can also collect money and resources before their ready. Real money can be used in this game but; they give you some for challenges and leveling up.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Awesome, my wife and I really enjoyed it! It doesn't get any better than this, loved it! Every episode left you in suspense, we couldn't get enough.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|Not so easy to use.Didn't work for me. Im not technilogically savvy and hoped it would be more user friendly. Who knows could just be me.
B00866JL96|5.0|Great movie. It came in perfect condition. I didn't understand what the UltraViolet Digital Copy was until I received it, but a  little quick research before buying would have clued me in.
0679905278|5.0|Perfect graduation gift for college grads! Would read it myself, but I am not a college graduate! Needed Three more words to publish!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was glad to get it at such a great price. I have found no problems with it, and we have watched it many times already.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good acting, lots of blood and gore, an inapropriately young kid with a gun and great zombies!  What more could a girl ask for?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's pretty awesome! It's pretty realistic and I  like all of the activities I can do. I hate this  13 word minimum carp.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game os one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time. I didn't want to get it at first but it was awesome once I tor started I didn't want to stop
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The Honor Harrington books should be enjoyed by all ST fans.  They are one of the memorable books I read more than once.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very fun. I love the mystery boxes. But what I think is unreasonable, is the amount of like say Easter eggs you have to get for that board and for the alien. I also think the prices are too much.
0553062182|5.0|This is an eye-opening read for everyone who has the trait of high sensitivity, or anyone who has a family member/friend with this trait.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Have enjoyed playing this game. Has enough puzzles to keep you interested. Decent story line. Graphics are good. Think it is worth the money.
0345529057|5.0|Very well written--was amazed at how closely season 1 of the HBO series followed the book.  The second season did not follow the book as closely and they combined several characters and events, but still very well done.  I am looking forward to season 3 of the HBO series to see how closely they follow the book.  This is a series worth reading.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I liked this second series--it wasn't as close to the book as the first season, however it was well worth watching.  I was sorry that Sean Bean is no longer on the series, as he was the reason I started watching it in the first place, however I'm really enjoying all of his children in the books and on the screen, kudos.  Can't wait until season three comes out on DVD, as I don't subscribe to HBO.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|I have read all of the books that this series was based on.  The 2 seasons that they filmed were very well done and the casting of those shows were well matched.  Sorry they cancelled the series--I had looked forward to watching it on tv on Saturday afternoons.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|If you are a real fan this is a must have! I especially like Mojo Man, its a trip back in time, Incredible talent and this release shows us depth and insight into the Legendary Jimi Hendrix . Thank You !
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Like nothing I've read before. The story is told by several eyewitnesses from around the world offering a different perspective. I definitely recommend reading it if you are looking for a quick and interesting read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|lots of action,drama and character developement<br />the fights,finding Carl,thou i think the people would bring more people into the fold,their acting more inhumane than the walkers
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It is utterly beyond me how anyone could give this a five star review. It is a coming-of-age story of a boy, Thor, who leaves home, travels to join the Legion, and has mysterious undeveloped magical powers. It is a bit Cinderfella-like, with mean brothers and father but it never occurs to Thor that they might not be blood relatives (I wager that subsequent volumes clear this up), and there is even a sort-of fairy godfather, Argon. The theme is a common one oft repeated, (yawn) but it can be interesting only if done very well. It's possible an uncritical adolescent might find it interesting. By the way, since when is a 14 year old boy not interested in girls and sex, although a girlfriend is introduced later (too good and too beautiful)?<br /><br />The general storyline is OK, but the writing is choppy. The pace is very uneven, sometimes zipping along so fast that my head spins, and then too slow. The characterizations are too simplistic - good guys are unbelievably too good and the bad buys are too transparently bad, with nothing in between.<br /><br />Most irritating of all was the obvious lack of an effective review. The book is peppered with misspellings (some no doubt due to words slipping past the spell checker), but others just because the wrong word was used. Many words are flat out wrong ( e.g.: gait is a noun not a verb; shaffron?). I also found quite a few grammatical mistakes that were not there for any literary reason.<br />I hope the spelling etc. is corrected in subsequent volumes.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series. 5 stars hands down :) Gideons love for Eva is unbelievable. I would have to say it was better then I imagined it would be. Completely mind blowing!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Both my father and my brother love \\"Game of Thrones\\". Personally, I completely missed the first season, but started watching the second. It took about five episodes of \\"compulsory watching\\", but then I was hooked! This series apparently slowly gets to you. And poisons you? I mean, it's all just a fictionalized account of the Early Middle Ages, with some Roman orgies thrown in for good measure. Or...? ;-)<br /><br />It seems that the main weakness of the series (about a dozen story lines with characters whose number is legion) is also its biggest strength. It's difficult not to find *some* character that captivates you, if only for a couple of episodes. Even so, \\"Game of Thrones\\" probably wouldn't have worked without the previous success (until the last episode) of \\"Lost\\", which also had innumerable characters and a near-impenetrable plot.<br /><br />Personally, I'm fascinated by Tyrion, the manipulative dwarf who is actually one of the good guys. His philosophy is to trick evil people into doing the right thing - somehow, that squares with my own view of politics. Arya is another interesting character, and then there's Daenerys Targaryen, Melisandre and her pseudo-Zoroastrian religion, and \\"The Others\\" beyond The Wall. (The Others are coming!) However, I readily admit that I can't make out all the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, mercenaries and prostitutes...yet.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I will nevertheless award this quasi-high fantasy series five stars. But here's a prediction: George R. R. Martin will probably die before he finishes \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", making the last episode of \\"Game of Thrones\\" even less bearable than that of \\"Lost\\". All this will take place at some point in 2020.<br /><br />You read it here first.... :-0
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you loved season 1 - season 2 will not disappoint.  It all ends way too soon and leaves you anticipating season 3.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|I am so in love with this show. Just watched all 7 seasons. And now I'm starting over again. I just love the show. It's so good. Season six and seven were a little rough but from what I hear season eight is just as good as seasons four and five.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this show. Season six and seven were a little rough to get through but still love the show regardless.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I am a denzel fan and I was not disappointed. This was a truly amazing film he did a wonderful job, I wouldn't have expected the ending to come like it did and he was very noble for what he did. I couldn't have done it and I don't think many people would have done what he did, this was a truly amazing piece of work. After I rented it I had to buy it.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE!! I was pleasantly suprised how good this movie was, I wasn't ready for it to be so good. I can't wait for this to come to dvd. I was so blown away by all the actors that I really didn't want it to end. Although I am not a Quinton Tarentino fan I really enjoyed this movie. I was amazed that something  that could have been considered \\"different\\" was so enjoyable.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Classic Justin Hayward-Moody Blues - yet to produce a bad one and this just reinforces the point.  Let's just hope he follows it up and keeps them coming - Love Them.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie is kind of like &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; in that it shows the innocence of children and how they are not yet prejudiced against those who are not &#34;like them&#34;.  It is a good movie to watch with older kids or young teens and then have a discussion about how prejudice can be so very hurtful in our society.
B001BR5NN0|3.0|This movie has been around for quite some time and it is geared towards teenagers who really seem to like it a lot.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I saw in theaters and rented it on here and after watching it three times I just had to buy it so I can watch it whenever I feel like being scared. The music alone is very chilling and disturbing. Without it ,this movie wouldn't have been half as scary. Watch with a decent pair of headphones for the ultimate experience!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|So I just finished reading this literally three minutes ago, and the ending left me completely shocked. I was breathless (in a bad way) and was at a loss for words. This is how Oliver is going to conclude her heart-stopping, awe-inspiring, blush-inducing, read-this-in-a-day trilogy?!?!?! With that kind of a last page?? My, my, my, I was struck dumb. Not such a great move, Ms. Lauren Oliver.<br /><br />What I loved about this book were all the twists and turns that were thrown in there-- whoa Hana, did NOT see that coming!- and the troubled relationship between Alex and Lena-- excuse me, Coral, but could you go step on a lego please? I loved the way Lena's character developed into this tough-as-nails chick from the Wilds, and I loved Hana's story with Fred. The action scenes were pretty exciting to read, making my heart pump like it did with the other books. In that field, Oliver's skill was the same level of power.<br /><br />I was utterly disappointed in how Oliver wrote Julian's character after so artfully making us all fall in love with him in PANDEMONIUM-- for reals? All you're giving us is cuddling and a few shirtless scenes which aren't steamy at all? &lt;/3<br />The way she wrote the overall book fell flat, compared to how amazingly she wrote the other two (if you're gonna start us off with a winning first impression, Ms. Oliver, you gotta earn our applause with a stunning finale that blows us all away). It felt like she hadn't written in a while, and was trying to get back into her old ways. It got progressively better and better as the book went on, however, and by the end I was gripping my phone (I read on that) with white knuckles. I was like, \\"Ah! There you are, Oliver!\\"<br /><br />All in all, I was a little disappointed with REQUIEM. The two preceding books were so glorious and enchanting, but this one was just... not. I still love Lauren Oliver though, and hope to read more of her books, but REQUIEM was just not her best.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I loved the illustrations in this book. Makes it look like a very old book from the era of Sherlock Holmes. Great detective stories with great drawings. These stories never lose their charm.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. There were many parts that I couldn't stop reading. It kept my attention the whole time. The ending was a little bit abrupt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun. I cant seem to stop. if like horses then u should get this app. I cant have a horse so this is the closets to taking carat of one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the most awesomest game ever and I am a kid like I am 14 years old it is awesome get it get it get it get it get it get it get it!!!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|To be a game on kindle this is such a wonderful game I've play a lot of games on my new kindle fire hd and this one is by far on  of the best level up games
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|this one was for me i loved it i am a bruno mars fan i love his energy and the way he puts himself into his music
B006N9KFPC|5.0|i am a fan of adam lambert loved this c.d. i hate looking for certain music in the stores must rather let my fingers do the walking
B00A1XIXO6|3.0|If this where a follow up to new maps of hell I would be raving about it, but after the spectacular &#34;The Dissent of man&#34; it is a bit of a letdown.  Bad religion fans would probably still enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My three year old daughter loves playing this game. she absolutely loves horses and this keeps her occupied while I have things I have to tend to. Also keeps her quiet during mass with the volume off. I have enjoyed playing it myself. :-)
B00AA0U046|5.0|I grew up listening to Jimi and pre-ordered the album. A whole new side of him and a great addition to any collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read a ton of books and this one is the best.  The story line is like no other and it is great.  I cried and laughed.  Fantastic....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!IT IS SO FUN!I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME! GO SUBWAY SURFERS! ITS AMAZING! I LOVE GETTING COINS AND MYSTERY BOXES![[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great reviews and now I know why!!!  This was a wonderful story, easy read and hard to put down!  Packed with so much more then I expected!  Can't wait to read the next book!  Thank you Suzanne Collins
B001BC2ZS6|3.0|It's a really good story and I would have rated it 5 stars but it was really,really,really,really, sad in a lot of parts.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|She must have had someone else write this one!  Started out really slow and didn't improve very much. Still I let a friend read it, and she said t was ok.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I ENJOY PLAYEN THIS GAME.YOU WILL TO!!!!!!:):DIt is so WUNDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!;D :):);):)So get the app and start runnen and jumping now!!!!!!:)
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a great read for runners of any kind...even the ones who don't know that they are runners yet.  I laughed, I cried... ok I didn't cry, but I did get quite a few chuckles out of this book.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|You get what you pay for.  Fortunately in this case I didn't pay anything, so I really can't complain.  The text is intact, but the page breaks are a little disconcerting (appearing in the middle of the page, which is weird since Kindles are supposed to flow text).  But, still a good read, nonetheless.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Great amount of detail makes you wish it was an inch taller. Many, many joints make it infinitely posable. Too bad my son will destroy it ultimately, but its build quality makes me feel this will take quite some time. Buy it
B00846F1YW|3.0|It's kind of nice to see a lot of these older games resurfacing on the Android platform, but on the other hand, they're not exactly new and exciting anymore.  I remember playing these on the old Reflexive site many moons ago.  Can't even imagine paying for these; glad I got them as the FAotD.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Completely addicted to this show! Great cast of characters and I just love the fresh take on the tales I grew up with.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Had to uninstall after it started trying to view every file type I downloaded, including ePub, PDF, and others. That seems a bit overkill to me...
B000VSBX34|5.0|I've always loved this film.  First, I had the original VHS version.  Later, I had the 1997 MPI DVD version as well as the 2007 2-disc new DVD version.  The restoration on the 2007 DVD is terrific, despite the DVD being only a standard definition format.<br /><br />Considering the hard work that went into producing the 2007 DVD, I'm sure the restoration team must have prepared a hi-def master for this movie.  So, I'm hoping that Apple releases a blu-ray of this.  And, If the releases of Yellow submarine and Magical Mystery tour are any indication of things to come, I'm sure this will happen before too long.<br /><br />I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Just like the Windows version that I played off of the Reflexive web site many years ago.  Well, except for tapping support, anyway.  And too obviously a Harry Potter rip-off.  But a good time-waster.
B00991TCOG|5.0|There isn't much to say except that this is a fantastic album. It is a mixture of classical and pop music which is probably why I like it so much. My kids love listening and dancing to it as well so I'd say it is a great buy
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Natalie Portman was a bit miscast in this picture, and Ashton Kutcher was his usual self. Not much of a stretch for either one of them. The supporting cast was also average.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a wonderful app for the little girl in u that always wanted a pony! way more fun than I thought it would be. All of my co workers play it lol

B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this novel the highest rating primarily based on well developed and appealing characters. There was nothing to dislike for me.<br />I will now start the third.

B00846REIS|4.0|A lot like 50 Shades Of Gray, but seems to be a bit more twisted. Not quite as addicting but I really like it. If you like 50 Shades you'll probably like this. Has a lot of the same stuff.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|My husband and I love the music this man plays.  Joe is phenomenal. A true prodigy.  Will continue to buy his music. If you really appreciate a musical artist, this is the guy.  It is amazing how many styles of playing the quitar this guy can do! WOW

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a fun game. it gets you hooked right off the bat. I highly recommend this game for any horse lover.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I watched the HBO series The Pacific and that is where I first learned of Eugene Sledge. That led me to this book he wrote about his experiences as a marine in WWII in the Pacific theater. What makes this book fairly unique is that it is focused on the day-to-day activities of the marine footsoldier in combat as well as preparing for combat.<br /><br />It is not a battle by battle history of the war in the Pacific. Rather it is focused on the daily routine of the marines who carried out their immediate assignments and let the higher ups work out the strategies and plans. It shines for the way it presents the human aspects of what he encountered as well as how the violence of the struggles they endured changed those who survived.<br /><br />I had high expectations based on the HBO series as well as other reviews of the book; I was not disappointed. This was an excellent read and I highly recommend it even for those who are not that interested in WWII.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love the plot and different locations you visit in the game. Well planned out and a lot of.game for little.money!
B000JMKNVK|5.0|Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro are always fast paced and exciting. The characters are well developed. I can see each person in my mind.

0762777931|5.0|I purchased this book last year and followed about 90% of the dietary plan.  I was interested in the juicing section and learning how to detox my body in a safe and healthy way and Carr's advise was definitely beneficial.  This book is easy to follow, very informative, and encouraging.  After a week or so eating clean (raw vegan) and juicing, I felt more energetic, lighter, and started to lose weight. Although, if you're going to try this plan, have an open mind and open wallet.  Depending on your access to affordable, fresh, and organic foods, you may find it hard to maintain the raw vegan diet and juicing for an extended period of time. I still juice occasionally and for some reason have not had the urge to consume much dairy since trying  the program, but lack of discipline on my part is the reason why I have not stuck with the program in the long run. Kris Carr is a beautiful person and a freak of nature!
B00AEBBA36|5.0|this is a very factual story of the introduction of our countries offensive tactics in viet nam in 1965.  lead by,  hal moore (played by mel in this movie)  who many years after this battle buried his wife among his troopers who died during this 3 day battle.
B003Q6D1YW|2.0|This movies reveals the deception of an online friendship. That’s an interesting subject.<br />The problem is it could have been told in 15 minutes. Instead, it has been stretched to last 1 hour and 28 minutes. Consequently,  it’s boring most of the time.<br /><br />Another problem is the misleading advertisement. On the back of its cover, there’s a quote from RollingStone magazine which says “There’s more killer suspense in this one-of-a-kind film…” That’s an exaggeration. There’s no suspense, just a little bit of curiosity-provoking. Then the deception was exposed. Then, I was left thinking :” Yeah!

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read about a Navy Seal.  What makes this book so great is the actual story of one man and what he overcame to become a Navy SEAL.
B00991TCOG|5.0|As a violinist myself, from a young age, I knew classmates who had formed bands. Interested, as I was, to perform with them, my specialty was violin. I offered over and over, \\"If you ever need a violinist [for your band], let me know. I am interested.\\" Then, years later, I \\"discover\\" songs from *this* album on Pandora. Regardless of their individual ratings, they are all absolutely spectacular. Thank *you* for living my dream as a violinist who excels outside the purely classical realm. (I am just glad that someone is following that path.) Whether you are an electronica, pop, R&B, hip hop, or Celtic violinist--you bring new-found versatility, and renewed vibrancy, to a beautiful instrument that we both admire. Congratulations.

B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|its not the best game in the world but its good for its price free needs scary music and more wrendering it has bad graphics
B005DD7TI0|3.0|Worth renting, good story, I liked the movie and would watch it again.<br />I liked the movie and would watch it again.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|My first King novel ever. Loved the descriptive writing and the monologue.  The story while somewhat interesting didn't seem to be as well thought out as the 850+ pages would have us believe.<br />Also, I was disappointed in King's final analysis on the topic of the assassination.<br />And while I've come to expect to find an author's political viewpoint expressed in their work, I can't overlook \\"facts\\" that are misleading and blatantly false.<br /><br />Having said all that I would certainly recommend the book to people who grew up during that turbulent time. To younger readers I would urge them to read this only if they wished to experience what life was like for their parents.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Florida Georigia Line, Here's to the good times cd. I just picked this up and it'a a great cd. Highly recommend this album. A+
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I got the game for the FAOTD and I like spooky stuff but the music and graphics scared me and I would have to quickly exit. I think the controls are really unintuitive and I didn't like using it.

B00BEU6JVY|4.0|Anything from Justin or the Moodies is wonderful. This good classic Justin. Everything mellow and nice. I just wish there could be another Tuesday Afternoon or White Satin but this is fine.
1250012570|5.0|This was such a sweet book. I laughed, I cried, I swooned. I usually have a hard time reading books where the kids are abused or the parents just don't pay much attention to them. I don't know why but I just don't like reading about it. At all. So, once I got into this book and saw that it was in this book, I was a little concerned. I ended up loving this book though. They don't let their family life destroy them. I think it was written so well and that the kids really handled it very maturely.<br /><br />The romance aspect was adorable at first! They were so clueless that even just talking to each other was such a treat for both of them. The first time they held hands was so sweet! As the book went on, things started to heat up. They were so clueless but were learning things together. It really fit in the book perfectly, but I would not recommend this book to young teens because of this part.<br /><br />The ending was rough for me. I like books that give me absolute closure and are happy endings. This book didn't give me that. Some people might say it was an absolute ending, but I still have questions. In my mind, it was a happy ending. It's still bittersweet though. I don't want to give it away, but no matter how I spin the ending, it's not perfect. They had hard lives and sometimes things can't end with a fairy tale ending, although I like to think they can. All in all, I loved this book.<br /><br />I received this book for free in return for an honest review.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Must warn those of you that are sensitive to foul langange, this one is line for line foul. Also, the first scene is extremely nude. However, the plot concerning alcoholism plays out very, very well.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Great game! Awsome graphics, and intuitive/responsive controls. Thank you so much for adding the option for new effects.  Works great on my nabi 2 tablet but could you optimize it for tegra 3 chip because I know tegra 3 can handle the graphics with both effects check marked but controls seem to studder with both checked. Please look into it.  Nabi 2 with 1.3 Ghz Quad qore with Tegra 3 GPU ( 12 Cores ) full spes here:  [...] thanks a lot keep up the good work
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Never heard of this Tommy Lee Jones films and it was pretty good wtihout having to show a lot of gore with the murders.<br />Jones plays his usually ornery character who manages to come through despite a bunch of personal afflictions and attitudes.<br />I good find on Amazon Prime for free viewing.
0307341550|5.0|Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn’s first novel, is an impressive story about a family of deeply disturbed, unhealthy women.  While a very different story from her #1 New York Times Bestseller, Gone Girl, it is evident that Flynn has truly delved into the dark side of the feminine psyche.  And while it’s not exactly “fun” to read, it is so disturbing that it makes you want to read more.  Or, as more eloquently put by the Chicago Tribune, it “Keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.”<br /><br />The Synopsis:  Camille Preaker, a reporter, has recently been released from a mental hospital after a relatively short stay.  Camille, a “cutter,” has been carving words into herself for years, until there is no space left on her skin other than her neck, face, and a small circle on her back.  After resuming her job, she is assigned to investigate the murders of two young girls from Wind Gap, Missouri–her home town.  When she arrives, after having been away for eight years, she gradually has to confront a deeply troubled past, and a family (and community) that are just as sick as ever.<br /><br />Should you read this book?  Yes.  It is well-written. The words, like the razors that cut into her skin, are sharp, edgy, and searing with bitterness.  The darkness of this book is just scintillating.  It’s so evil and yet not in a cliched, obvious sort of way.  There are a few scenes that just leave you in chills.  Not solely because Flynn details such terrific malevolence, but because it is all too real.  And even if none of us have met anyone like this before, I think we’ve all had those moments of intuition when we realize we are in the presence of something or someone who is truly evil.  At least I know I have.  And while that may not sound like an enjoyable read, there is something about it that is compelling, perhaps because our intuition tells us: We have met this kind of evil before, but we’ve ignored it, brushed it off, said it wasnt there…when it was.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a really fun little game. It isn't overly complicated but also not so simple either. This is a nice little challenge.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie was exactly as  it was advertised, so I am happy with my purchase of this tape. Good movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another excellent read from Nicholas Sparks.  Was a little surprised by the graphics of the book, a little out of his element, however, it made the book very believable.
B0050C863G|5.0|Several years ago I suspended my cynicism, switched off my mobile phone and went on a two-day meditation course.  After an awkward forty-eight hours of chanting, bell ringing and deathly silences I was sent home with a personal mantra and a recommendation to practice `doing it' for thirty minutes twice a day. Guess what happened? I didn't do it. Every time I sat down, hoping to find calm, I ended up compiling mental to-do lists. When the time was up I'd leap out of the chair feeling frantic and annoyed that I'd wasted half an hour of my life. Over the years I've read other books on the subject and dipped in and out. Sometimes the advice to `imagine my thoughts like fluffy clouds on a summer day' has worked but, more than often, it hasn't. I started reading Get Some Headspace after a friend's enthusiastic recommendation. I really like Andy's down-to-earth language and his personal stories. I can relate to his desire to manage the negative/rambling voice in his head and his initial struggles to achieve positive results from meditating. I've registered online, downloaded the app (which is brilliant because you can have a guided meditation anytime, anyplace), and I'm enjoying my ten minutes everyday. I think this system works because it offers accessible support and encouragement and it enables me to easily incorporate meditation into a busy day. To my amazement, I'm beginning to think ten minutes isn't long enough!
B004BC7MRM|4.0|Love this album, but there is very little that Kid Rock has done that I don't like.  There are a few songs that aren't radio edits.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|l love the large keys and it is very easy to use. I would reccomend this app to any one. I use this instead of the one on my phone.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am looking forward to a long Sunday in bed with these series.  Such a good story line.  Relaxation on the way!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was awesome!I really<br /><br /> recommend reading this book even if you are young or old. It really kept me busy!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Nothing like having ane and two on hand to prepare you for season three.  Don't have to try to remember who was who or who did what, I will have it right here for recall.  Yeah!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the most beautiful love story I have ever read! Also the saddest. I read it two times and cried several times while reading. Mostly I only go for mysteries and thrillers but am glad to have taken Amazon's advice that it was one of the best novels for the month. Thank you Amazon for providing me with many hours of enjoyable entertainment.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Can't wait for a rainy day to watch all episodes. It will be gret knowing once season 3 comes along, if I have forgotten anything, I can go back for a reminder.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|What a clever and fun film. This movie is lots of fun for everyone in the family. We'll watch it over and over.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|An outstanding vocalist and song writer!  And all at the early age of 22 with a Cockney accent that you can't detect in her singing voice
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I use this on nearly every PC I build. I've even used it to fix my PlayStation 3 once!<br /><br />If you're having problems with an overheating processor, try this thermal paste. Chances are, this will get solve your problems.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|You know, I thought this movie was one of those typical romantic comedies but I really felt this one. Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher are an unlikely match but they make it work in No Strings Attached. I loved it!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|It's a cheap way to really help your processor stay cooler. While it took me a while to get it all together, once it was set in place, it really helped keep my PC a lot cooler. The fan isn't loud at all.<br /><br />Words of advice! Make sure your case is big enough for this thing, it almost didn't fit in my mid-tower chassis. Also, while this comes with thermal paste (not sure what brand or the quality of it), I always recommend using Arctic Silver 5 instead.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Buying dinosaurs makes my heart happy and.. like... expanding  just like my park is expanding. I love to feed my dinosaurs until the feeding sign turns into a evolving sign. Man there is a a lot of dinosaurs and levels! But, I still think that it's fun and maybe you will enjoy playing with it and see how many levels you past or how big your dinosaurs are or how many evolves.<br /><br />  Well, I hope that you have a good time playing with your own park.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I had heard about &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; from friends as the third season was beginning, so I tried watching it  But, I couldn't connect with the story because I was so far behind on what had already happened.  The Seasons 1 & 2 DVD caught me up, and it is such an engrossing story.  Glad I made this purchase.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. No time spent on trying to figure out out, just get on and use it. Very basic and helpful
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Rango is an entertaining movie all the way through. I enjoyed the humor, but think some of it is for adults than little kids. The artwork was superior. The story was good, but not new. I would recommend this movie to anyone over 10 years of age. I might buy this movie.
B00A83075M|3.0|I loved the film in theaters and couldn't wait to have a copy. The order came right on time, but it skipped in several places throughout. I should have paid attention to the other Disney movie reviews on Amazon that said the movie they got skipped. If you really want a copy get it in stores.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Having seen the movie I could relate to all the characters in the book and get a better understanding of thier true characteristics such, the movie could not portray in the the time albeit 2.75 hours. IN addition some of the historical events that are described in the book particularly Waterloo stimulated me to research further into the history to understand it better. Some of the historical and political monologues do go on a tad.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I thought this would be great until I played on compatible device which is my smart phone.  My question is:  why does a game need access to my Sim card on my phone?  This is the one and only game I have had do this.  Will uninstall for sure.  Makes me uncomfortable.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Fantastic game with good graphics and user friendly gameplay. Very fun time killer. Using real money for game is very unnecessary for this game and even if you want to buy extra stuff the prices are beyond fair and reasonable. Only problem is the multiplayer content I can't access due to a bug in the game for android users.. I'm using my kindle fire he and it just doesn't let me access content or log in... good game tho. :)
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have no problem with having to pay to play and have made Many purchases that went thru without a problem. Unfortunately there have also been a total of 6 times that the purchase went thru but I was not credited with the items. I immediately contacted support and received a standard automatic response that my problem was being looked into and to provide information. I responded with the requested information and provided proof of purchases. I did not receive a response and despite numerous follow up emails still have not been refunded or credited with the items. I am now following up with Amazon but in the meantime I am out $200 in total.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|enjoyed the simple life of  this movie and the heart that really is true and believe a great movie thanks
B004R1VXYU|5.0|Clearly influenced by the great southern bands like Skynard, Marshall Tucker and Allman Bro's, these guys are on a roll.  Let's hope they keep writing and playing.<br /> Buy this LP now.<br /> My only gripe is the audio quality of the last track (#12) is very poor-sounds like it was taken from a scratched LP.  Hear that, Wiggy Thump?  You've embarrassed yourselves here!  Don't hold the quality of song #12 against the band-they did their job.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like that I can relax on my couch while searching for interesting things.  Had a problem bidding a couple of times as my kindle seemed to have problems keeping up with the last minute bidding rush.  I'll keep use it to search and put in an opening bid but for the last minute rush I'll go go my desktop.
B0035JGYZS|3.0|Although my sound system said I was recieving a 5.1 signal, something went wrong in the conversion process. 1st I thought it was my stereo settings, but when I went to a different movie, all was perfectly fine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like the best game in the world. It has awesome graphics and gameplay. Once I started playing it I couldn't stop. It's way to awesome to delete. COOKIES :D.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|nazis in south america running breeding camps for fit and unfit twins is a little far fetched for me.  there is an upside, though, but if i told you, it would spoil the surprise.
B004WMKXWM|5.0|Great movie for the fans and a very good movie for none fans.  Collecting the Blue Ray in 3D I liked it so much;)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a good file explorer for Android.  It seems to find and locate the servers and files on my network.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|While not as compelling as Book One, this was a great lesson in the history of the WWII.  There are so many characters in so many countries that it is really difficult to keep track of them all.  It was helpful to have them all listed at the beginning of the book.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|The cd skips around in the middle of a song and there are what sounds like scratches on the cd as it gets<br />stuck in one place.  If I had saved the packaging I would have sent it back immediately
B009GX7IRA|4.0|But not as good as it used to be.  Time has taken its toll on this once great TV program.
B001FD5KJM|3.0|Yes, I liked the special effects, the hardware stuff and to an extent, the story. But most other actors were quite weak. I am not sure it's due to their own limitations as actors or the script was weak. I am waiting to see Ironman-2 and 3. By the way, Pepper was a sweet addition--especially when she talks about \\"taking the trash\\" out. Ha ha, that took me few moments to get the burn.<br />I watched the basic version from the library, not any special edition or such.<br />Speaking of hardware, one must give credit to the animator and engineers who came with the electromechanical schematic of the armors--awesome.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I like the characters and how they interact with each other. I like it being available on my Kindle, makes is easy to view anytime.
B0068THAGY|3.0|Well, maybe I am oversimplifying and because I am watching it too late in the era to like it as wholeheartedly as many did. I enjoyed the kid s dialogues and their acting most, especially the \\"Mint\\" parts.<br />Otherwise, it was often a very lightweight, silly movie.<br />Having spent some in the Air Force, the military characters seemed unrealistic and tacky, and over acting their parts.<br />The core concept was not bad, but the makers of the show could have gone on a different track. About the Dukes of Hazard part: well, the teenage driving and the young girls kind of reminded me of the old TV series, that's all.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Why can't they just leave well enough alone??<br /><br />I used to love my Yahoo mail, I even pay for it and the changes are ridiculous.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|It's a very enjoyable movie. Enough said.<br />Typical Hollywood, your time will pass easily and Liam N's acting was superb and so were the teenage girl's and the villains' of Paris.<br />Suspense was believable and fight scenes were well coordinated.<br />Watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this Game is awsome i recommend it to all people it so fun . F or example you  get to groom your horse and bath it sometimes you get to clean the horses stables and you get to ride your own horse
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Chasing mavericks was a great movie even if you have never even surfed before,  great rental on amazon on demand
B00881VLCE|1.0|After downloading ap and a puzzle group, NOTHING.  Will be deleting the ap from my kindle when finished here.  Love puzzles, but trying to use this should not be the only puzzle they provide
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I thought it was a very well written book.  It was interesting to find out about this group of indians and how well they ran in one of the toughest ultras anywhere.
B0026772N8|5.0|The only thing I regret is that I did not read it like thirty years earlier.<br />I have recommended this book for my children and some close friends who I would think could benefit from it.<br />In short, read this book and all published books by John Irving, John Steinbeck and Graham Greene..<br />Then you do like Robert Prisig says: Be perfect and live your life naturally!<br />It is human nature to fail, we all do and we will all do in the future too.<br />These books are all very good entertainment and you will be a bit better too.
0446528056|5.0|I was told this was an excellent book to read and I wanted to try it, still working on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a very good but addictive game once you play it you cant stop playing it at all
B004U8VX2M|4.0|missed it when it was first shown -- so glad to be able to watch it through amazon prime and thoroughly enjoyed it--the recreation of a bygone era is amazing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is just as enjoyable and addictive as the original. Fun new graphics and new characters make the game difficult to put down.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My daughter finally sat down to watch this, she is almost 4 so it is a challenge, and loved it. The movie looks very detailed and smooth.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are in one movie, so why not see that? Storywise, “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” has little new to say, but directed by John Madden ('Shakespeare in Love'), the romantic comedy accomplishes what it sets out to do, though rather in an obvious way. The film is not free from clichéd conventions. Actually, it is full of them. Still, if you ask me if I enjoyed the film, my answer is, yes, definitely.<br /><br />As I said above, the story is nothing new. Seven British retirees travel to Jaipur, India, and start living together at the Marigold Hotel run by young and enthusiastic Sonny (Dev Patel). Over time, through various events, some funny, some romantic, some even poignant, the residents of the hotel (still being restored) are given chances to change.  The great ensemble cast includes Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton.<br /><br />Some compare “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” with “Love Actually” because of the film’s narrative structure, but I think the themes are closer to “Enchanted April” (twice filmed in 1935 and 1991, the latter directed by Mike Newell). The theme of British people living or travelling outside the UK has been frequently taken up in British novels and films, and as is often the case with them, you may find the humor of “Marigold Hotel” a little low-key.<br /><br />And that is part of the film's charm. “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” is a well-made romantic comedy. When it comes to the dramatic part of the characters, the film is sweet and charming, or maybe too sweet and charming, but still its charms are undeniable.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Wow! After the first couple listens I was like \\"it's okay but I still like Paramour Sessions & Metamorphasis better\\".<br /><br />Now, a solid 2 months after buying it this is my favorite full CD by Papa Roach. The Connection is loaded with songs I rate 4/5 stars in Media Player.<br /><br />My favorites are tracks 4. Silence is the Enemy, #6 Wish you Never met me (I LOVE how it changes tempo in 3 parts throughout the song...this is one of those songs that grows on you), #3 Where did the Angels Go, #5 Before I die, #7 Give me back my life, #8 Breath you in & #2 Still Swingin.<br /><br />Some people say this is too commercial? The only soft song is #9 Leader of the broken hearts. Tracks 2-8 are all SOLID rock songs that go great with working out/running...whatever!<br /><br />I'm glad I found out about this and picked it up! It's been my most listened to CD for the last 2 months easy since not much comes out anymore for decent hard rock....or if it does I don't hear it on the radio.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful book. Hours of pleasure. Lovely pictures of favorite characters and locations.<br />Lots of new information and background I did not know.
B0057ZSPD2|5.0|I would recommend this to any lovers of modern rock music...unless you plan to have young children listening (lots of f-bombs). I'm glad I could find the original (read: explicit) version of this album. I had only been able to find the &#34;clean&#34; version in stores.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not quite finished with this program, but I really like it. I usually lose interest in these sorts of things after a little bit, but because you change exercises ever 10 days or so, this one is holding my interest. The exercises are intense, but it's very satisfying to see your improvement from one day to the next.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Decent movie. Not sue of I would watch it more than once. Good picture and story.  However the movie drags.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Bought this for my daughter. The quality of the film is fantastic and she loves it. It makes me happy that she enjoys the classics so much!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Exceptional business wisdom in this book, broken down and simplified! Looking forward to next book.<br /><br />After using their product Basecamp I see how they practice what they preach in this book.<br /><br />Thanks, Mike
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This movie was a sleeper--I'd never heard of it but brought up recent dvds and there it was with some wonderful ratings. They were right. I've seen all the biggies this year and this one is as good as any of them. Simply beautiful in every way!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Love this movie, Beau is effing hot and it is a must have for rainy days! It is a little depressing
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I don't know about you but I'm use to a laptop. A laptop that I can find files in and organize my stuff.  ES File Explorer does just that. No big bells and whistles, just a very good file explorer.

B0092S4WLY|4.0|fun game. needs directions on game play but good clean puzzles. i would like to see more levels like everyone else, but i enjoyed the searching for clues on each of the eight existing ones. its a little awkward on kindle though
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome! better than the first your being chased by a giant gorilla<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I wonder if they make a 3rd :/
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The Table of Contents makes it easy to find exactly what is needed for each step.<br />Instructions are clear and useful for first-time Kindle publishing. I will use each time I prepare a new title to assure success.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Fun game.  Nice sound effects.  I like that the slender man whispers when near.<br />My first game after install was on the farm at night.  I had found 6/8 pages.  While I was running I fell through the ground into nothingness as the farm moved off into oblivion above me as I fell.  I was unable to recover and was forced to quit.  Game needs a \\"move to designated home\\" button unless the fall through ground can be fixed.  A option to disable sounds would be nice too.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great story.  Did not expect the story to go the route it did.. I did like killing floor a little bit more but this one did not disappoint.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Captivating. Interesting. Dramatic. I can't wait to keep going back to find out what happens next. This is the best way for me to learn history-- it comes to life.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|It truly was an inspiring movie, makes you think about life and not taking anything for granted.  Just love everything and everyone.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Anything by Philip K. Dick is supreme. I love the idea of the story, and very much enjoyed this movie. Although not the same as the original with Arnold S., it was still very enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is the best game in the world because I hav 2 horses and it's like your own horse in real life.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|More than any metal or punk album I own, whenever I need a pick-me-up, this one never fails to do the trick. It's a dangerous album in that it gets you so amped up you want to break a bottle over someone's head and start a bar fight. It's pure energy in music form. God, these guys are good.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|This is the best purchase that I have bought from Madonna &#34;EVER!&#34; The box set includes 11 cd and some of them are remastered.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray version of the Eagles Live From Melbourne and specifically the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track.  I awaited this release with much anticipation not for new music but for the Blu-Ray audio improvement over the CD's that I own from this band. This disc did not disappoint.<br /> As with many Blu-Ray concert discs the audio really begins to shine at higher volume. I ran 120 watts in 5.1 surround at 60% for concert effect. There are some exceptional performances on this disc that make it special in its own way over the studio versions and with 30 songs it is a no brainer buy. The picture quality is excellent with vibrant colors and lighting and editing that gives excellent close ups of the various instruments in synch with the audio. There is enough activity and varied angles that you never tire of watching as you are often placed front row, side stage or deep in the crowd.<br /> The audio on the DTS-HD Master 5.1 is not the default and must be selected from set up and once it starts it is nothing short of phenomenal. The instruments are defined with exceptional clarity and your ears will smile with the excellent mix of vocal harmonies and the plethora of background musicians.<br /> The Long Run kicks off the show nicely followed by New Kid In Town where the band displays a tightness that makes you question if it is a live version. Frey wails like it 30 years ago. Wasted Time follows and is one of those rare concert treats where it is so much better than the live version. Henley is out front and sings his butt off and we get a wake-up call on how truly excellent of a vocalist he is. There is a spacious use of the surrounds that puts you in the arena.<br /> Peaceful Easy Feeling left me feeling a little flat. Here the live version departs too much from the previous arrangements and it feels like there are too many instruments playing resulting in a muddled presentation but this is rectified when I Can't Tell You Why follows with a beautiful simple approach highlighting Timothy B and Steuart Smith.<br /> One Of These Nights is another treat as all the members are out front on guitars and the clarity of the instruments shines through reminding us that great musicians can recreate the studio sound when they play live. They do it again on The Boys of Summer and you get a feel for how much fun they are having as they jam on this tune. The harmonies are spot on with some delicious echo effect. On this song you really get an appreciation of how good a player Steuart Smith is. The crowd responds on its feet in appreciation at the end but rather than relish in the moment the band quickly launches in to In The City and Joe Walsh never sounded better on his slide guitar playing.<br /> After a break the band has changed from suits to casual and they open up with some mellow sound and a short time in to the second half there is another special live moment when they play Love Will Keep Us Alive. The arrangement is something special accentuated by so many magical notes being played along with perfect harmonies. The crowd knows they just got served a moment.<br /> Hole In The World did not do much for me when the studio version came out of this song written the night of 9/11 however this live version gives me a better appreciation as the troubadours from the seventies ask everyone to get along. The vocals spread out across the fronts dominate this song with good use of the rears to create the arena ambiance. The song builds to a great finish.<br />You Belong To The City and Life's Been Good have some awkward moments that had me going to the fridge for another refreshment and Walk Away seemed to be missing snap from the main riff that left me remembering the original.<br />Dirty Laundry is a pleasant surprise and everyone is playing a guitar in tight crisp precision. The guys really jam it on this one and remind us of the days of the seventies and guitar oriented bands like the Outlaws and Blue Oyster Cult. Thisis another song where the live version is so much better than the original and the DTS Master Audio serves it up on a silver platter.<br />Funk #49 has Joe Walsh playing a great bluesy intro and he delivers on the rest of the tune with the rest delivering expert back up.<br /> So much has been written about Hotel California and it is hard to top the Hell Freezes over version. I'm not sure this version does but then again it's a bit different. The crowd knows the intro immediately and what shines about this version is the camera work and use of crowd noise to put you in the song. Henley bellows from behind the stack and Steuart delivers on the double neck as the song builds to the anticipated climax which is highlighted by the dueling guitars and a side stage shot of guitar necks doing battle.<br /> Overall this is a fantastic concert disc both in terms of the concert experience with the varied live arrangements and the sound quality. In terms of audio it is one of, if not perhaps the best I have heard of the many I own and on par with SACD, DVD-Audio quality. Combine that with the playlist  of so many songs we know by heart and at under twenty bucks this is a must own.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|This dual has the studio cd version of their greatest hits and a DVD of their greatest videos. A must in anyone's collection!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought the book was so interesting, I felt sorry for Victoria, having the sad life she had.. I wanted to just shake her a few times, with how stubborn she was, when she had such a nice life with Elizabeth! I would have loved to see one of her floral arrangements.
B0075564A8|5.0|My favorite documentary of all times. This is a must to have in your Madonna Live DVD Collection. You will be dancing and singing along with the DVD!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was a wonderful, historic novel.  I loved the history and the characters.  The war was so vivid and makes you wonder how mankind can do such horrid things even in  war.  A very good read and I didn't want it to end.

6305692572|5.0|This is another movie for your Meg Ryan Library. It will make you cry and laugh but gets the point across!
B0093X80VQ|3.0|Only read this because we have to get a certain amount of reading points, it was weird reading it for the first time since second grade.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|A Taylor and Burton classic. This is a must for your library if you are a Taylor and Burton fan!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Rarely do I read a book in two days, in this busy world. It would have been even quicker if I didn't have to dry my tears so often. I've read Green's writing before. This is unbelievably good. Go read NOW!
1847879071|4.0|Really helped me when my ANOVA class wasn't assigned a text book. Should be cheaper as students are most likely buying it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|love it - who doesnt like saving money. if youve not descovered ebay - youre paying too much. shame on you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend recommended this tv series to me. It's addictive. Netflix didn't have season 2 available for streaming, long wait for DVD. Amazon had it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I never knew how free I am. I appreciate this book and what Afghan women endure. My heart bleed as I read this book it will forever be a mark in my life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book with all my heart. It shows you that it does not matter what you look like it's is only what's on the inside. I could read this book all day it was so good. It just doesn't tell you from August point of view but everyone else's to. I wouldn't be surprised if thins book one a mental
B0095P31L6|5.0|That is why every chance to laugh is important. This movie, for me, is a treasure chest of fun. I like to be entertained and this movie does that continually. BRAVO!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I like this movie because it takes a well-known President and places him into a world of the imagination. It is good because it mixes in believable things about President Lincoln before he became President, then it ends with a piece of history with which anyone who knows Lincoln is familiar. To elaborate here would be to ruin it for those out there who have not seen it, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a GOOD vampire movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game entertains me for hours. great if you're looking for a puzzle that challenges your mind. highly recommended thought provoking game
B006LSZECO|4.0|The entire first half of the book was boring. As a matter of fact, I started to read it several times, but lost interest.  Finally, I decided to keep plugging along, and I am glad I did.  Once I reached the midpoint of the story, I couldn't put it down!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it was great, best I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!! would like to see episode 13. Took a little while to download the only thing I didn't like.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I am very happy with this DVD.  It is amazingly perfect.  It is everything I expected in quality.  Thank you very much for this order.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|OK so it wasn't 100% historically accurate. In fact from what I hear the entire last 1/2 hour was fiction. but that's not the point. I's a movie not a documentary and to be on the edge of your seat for a film where you know the ending is just good film making.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. I really have to time myself on it or I find I'm getting obsessive and won't put it down. LOL
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The problem with this game, and all Ludia games I've played, is they have awesome potential but never fully live up to it. This game looks great, but it plods along initially, all but forcing me down a linear creation path.  It's nice that the game doesn't require I use cash, but it feels like Ludia has removed the fun for free players as well.  I wasn't thrilled that I could place only one type of dinosaur in the park, further limiting early entertainment value.<br /><br />Not a big deal for me personally but still worth mentioning, the game would not connect to Facebook (this app is misconfigured to connect to Facebook error).<br /><br />I gave Family Feud a try but soon deleted it as Ludia's limits on play proved too frustrating compared to other games; this game is heading down the same road.  I doubt I'll be giving Ludia another chance.<br /><br />**March 23 2013 Update**<br />I really wanted to like this dino park genre game, but after playing it a few more weeks, I'm officially done.  Coin acquisition is incredibly slow, and the margin between this acquisition and what's required to either upgrade dinosaurs or expand the park or gather food is so narrow that I feel I'm losing money to do any activity.  Because of this feeling, the only activity left is wait for dino pens to generate coin, which means watching a clock ranging from 5-45 minutes as of level 8 in the game.  This activity an engaging game does not make for me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|While Chris' writing is fairly simple, the story of his life growing up and then developing a career with the military was interesting.<br />I get to see a part of life that I can't share and think is very 'scary'!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Better than the first and that's hard to do. I can't wait to read the third book! Totally worth reading.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's totally unpredictable. You think  you know where it is going and then, BAM. Some new shocker changes everything. I couldn't put it down and was texting my book club friends, \\"have u gotten to part 2 yet?\\" I'm dying to discuss it with them. That is the sign of an excellent read, I think!
B007NZDES0|5.0|What an excellent show! Sade seems to be ageless and the musicians and stage show are excellent. I liked that Sade spoke to the audience occasionally and introduced the band. I think the quality is good. I do wish they had the combo available in bluray.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I loved this book-it made me laugh and cry. We wonder why Harold would just take off and start walking and how determined he was to make this pilgrimage.  It shows how an average person can make such an impact on so many people-not just Harold but all the characters in the book.  It will stay with you long after we've finished. Can't wait for her next book
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|My first impression: Herbie Hancock meets Jeff Beck! If you are a fan of the jazz/blues fusion genre, then this disc is amust for you. The CD has a great flow from start to finish with every artist shining through. The DVD is pretty good also...since Joe was the only artist I was aware I learned a lot from it. Any fan of great music will love this disc!
B0049VZ222|5.0|Was hesitant to watch this at first because of all the blood and guts but I love the truly original story lines and the well developed characters! I'm addicted!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I am not sure why but these movies over-promise and under-deliver..  I am a huge movie fan but I just don't buy into the hype of these movies
B00AVF8USS|5.0|i love this movie it takes you to a magical beautiful world and i love all the action in this movie
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app you get to interact with ppl you dont no its just fun you makr your own pics the way you want them
B000WMGPB4|5.0|I started by purchasing an different tripod because it was inexpensive. It was poorly made, with plastic connectors that were too light.  So, I moved up in price to this tripod.  It is sturdy and well made. It is light enough, packs small, yet extends sufficiently. No regrets on this purchase.
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun and easy to play. keeps your interest and I am 100%;addicted!! hatch all different and colorful dragons. you can also breed to create custom eggs that hatch. love this game.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Gets a little preachy toward the second half, but I feel like a better consumer for having watched it.  Makes you think twice about what and how we eat.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|great app.<br />easy to use and very &#34;user friendly&#34;<br />Would recommend this app. to all amazon users.<br />Functional and efficient
B000HZEE64|4.0|I was watching this movie as something I may have seen, but couldn't remember.  The movie is great.  It has aged well and the story line is still a good one.  Samuel L. Jackson is a true talent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. My friend introduced me to it. We were playing on her iPad and she said, \\"Want to see my new game?\\". I said sure and she got me hooked on it!!
0789318245|5.0|Tons of oldschool flash art to look at and a history of the tattoos. Love the vintage feel to the book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite books.  Not because it's great literature, but the story itself really kept me engaged and I found myself wanting to know how it was going to end.  Loved the characters.  I had a bit of trouble following the timeline (chapters jump around, but they tell you at the beginning of the chapter what the date is).<br /><br />A very good book, I know I'll read it over and over.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just love this whole series and am sorry that Season 3 is over.  Can't wait for Season 4.  the actors are wonderful and the fashions, settings, are supperb.
0761169431|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this.  I got it for him for a Valentine's Day present and he's gotten alot of enjoyment out of it.  I love that it has the Origami paper included.  Great for road trips too!
B00337KM2S|5.0|Up in the Air<br />The Movie<br />Review<br />By Richard Edward Noble<br /><br />Well, who doesn't like George Clooney?<br /><br />I am still a fan of Rosemary Clooney. So there you go.<br /><br />I had never heard of this movie but I live out in the woods and I get to see most movies long after their prime ... at home.<br /><br />That companies would hire other companies to fire their old, faithful employees is depressing enough but that a nice guy like George would be one of the nasty company's top hit men only serves to double the depression. But George takes it all in a kind of blue collar heroism.<br /><br />George is our anti-hero in this movie but his job seems to be the least of his problems. He likes it. What can we say? The fact that he has no problem with this job and that it is not played up in the movie adds to the matter of fact, modern day cruelty that we have all become immunized to these days.<br /><br />He likes firing people and feels he does it well. Being the companies # 1 hit man doesn't bother him in the slightest.<br /><br />Now if I hadn't just recently read a book about a guy whose job it was to repossess the homes, fancy estates, yachts and other incidentals of the super-duper, I might have found George's character a stretch. But in today's world, this type thing seems to be the norm.<br /><br />Consequently, like George, I had no problem identifying with this modern day hit man reality.<br /><br />But besides having this great job that pays George to fly him anywhere and everywhere, George has an enviable personal life also.<br /><br />He's a bachelor with a beautiful single's pad and he has a knockout chick who wants him just for his body. She's available around the world. And she just wants to jump Georgie's bones. She doesn't want to get involved. She's every single man's dream girl.<br /><br />The story has enough twists and surprises to keep even those who didn't go to the movie solely to stare at George Clooney busy.<br /><br />I was not shockingly surprised by any of the eventual results but I did find them clever and cute and all worth a big smile.<br /><br />George's conflict with his job comes when the company wants to update and modernize its tactics. Why pay the expense of flying people all over the world to fire other people when they can do the job by Skype technology of sorts.<br /><br />A TV screen placed in a private room with the victim, reduces risk and costs - no plane fares and no punch in the mouth or other nasty scenes. A person could now possibly do this job from the comfort of his home with no encumbering company conflicts. All these high priced, around the world hit men with large expense accounts to the company, could now be stay at home contract laborers.<br /><br />The movie has three plots going on at the same time - George's business career which is truly depressing from any moral standard but apparently only to us viewers, played against his personal life which is more optimistic, followed by his affair with the hot to trot Vera.<br /><br />George has a family and they are normal and nice.<br /><br />Vera, who has primarily been an erotic part of the George's business adventure, finds herself being invited into George's personal and family business. She goes along.<br /><br />All three plots end with Rod Serling or Alfred Hitchcock type surprises.<br /><br />Though the story is truly \\"Up in the Air\\" the movie is grounded in real time.<br />Both George and Vera Faminga do a good job making their characters real and believable.<br /><br />The Hobo Philosopher is a writer and the author of: \\"A Baker's Dozen,\\" a book of 13 short stories.s not shockingly surprised by any of the eventual results but I did find them clever and cute and all worth a big smile.<br /><br />George's conflict with his job comes when the company wants to update and modernize its tactics.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a good book and I loved it a lot and all my friends did to so so so
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love it, it dose feel a little cheep but it protects well and love to take phone in shower to listen music
B009CPE424|3.0|I have watched I & II. It's fun, but this one not as much fun as the other two. I think small kids may love it. My daughter is 10. she though is good.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game has a nice natural feel. Easy to navigate and clear graphics.  Overall, I`d reccomend it. I just wish this company wouldn't offer these free &quot;taste tests&quot; only to find out the games cost like $5!
B005D1IFUS|5.0|This is the first album I purchased of this band. I  like the rock n roll / blues sound of this band & the gutsy guitar through out, it sounds old schooll inmany ways to me
B002BVZ2GI|5.0|We need more movies like this when it comes too romance and comedy and drama!!! And it a perfect date kind of movie if your trying too get a date? Lol But great movie!!!  =))
B008SOS63S|5.0|I absolutely love a live recording & this album  of Joe's is top shelf in my opinion, his style, his running smoothnes & the mix of guest artists on this album is 1 to enjoy own & keep.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|This is a more or less formulaic movie set on a bicycle in New York!!<br /><br />****Sorta spoiler alertish - basic plot line - not details****<br /><br />However, because of the whole bicycle messenger and the twist as to WHY this particular 'package' is so important is heart-warming and makes the whole 'good guys beat the bad guys and get the girl' story completely forgivable!!<br /><br />The filming and special effects were very, very good on this and made me wince and cringe with each impact! Was very pleased with this purchase.  Had lots of action, a backseat love story, and of a family fighting against the odds to get back together.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It was not too difficult to figure out...when they are too hard it becomes work rather than fun and this one was fun!!!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I am a major fan of Clint Eastwood ever since the whole 'spaghetti western' thing with the Man With No Name Trilogy.  I honestly believe he has become better with age and seeing him in movies like 'Trouble With The Curve' and 'Gran Torino' I feel we get to see more of HIM in the movies.<br /><br />This is a heartwarming tale of a father and daughter working their way back to each other after having grown apart.  Oh, and a little baseball scouting is in it too.  : )
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is such a great album. Tegan and Sara provide plenty of energy and emotion with Heartthrob! I'm so glad I found them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I succumbed to peer pressure. Wasn't interested in this show at first. But finally gave in. Everyone said don't start watching season 3 on TV. Have to go back and catch up with first two seasons. So thankful Amazon Prime has it. Great storyline.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|British being British. What more could you ask for? Here are the eleven more words necessary to complete this review.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In the last year or so I have read or watched many stories of US citizens that have such a driven mind set for dedication and patriotism it is mind boggling to me. Chris Kyle is one of these persons.<br />His book should be required reading for all Americans.
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|Liked the show very much and the excellent way it creates suspense, but the plot is not sustainable and it certainly isn't believable. But for pure entertainment value I enjoyed it very much.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|Regarding the product,  it was a very good print - no problems in playing it.<br /><br />As for the film, in my opinion it was a lot better than most today.  I've read that Robert Wagner thought he wasn't right for it, but his youthful enthusiasm made it work.  He was also surrounded by extremely good actors.  Lots of adventure, fun, excitement and a fast moving film make it a winner.
B005K01VZS|5.0|As a follower of Mitch Albom I enjoyed yet another one of his books. Everyone who is questioning faith should read it. It sure does make me appreciate what I do have.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I was drawn to this book because of its reference to Greek mythology of which I was a fan many years ago.  It turned out to be Greek mythology fast-forwarded to the 21st century.<br /><br />It turned out that you did not need to have much of a background in mythology to enjoy the book.  It is not serious reading.  However, it was entertaining and a good book to read if you just want to have a breath of fresh air and read something easy on the mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Forget 5 star's I give it 6 you'll love this game plus it's FREE so get this app cause it's addicting and you can go against your friends on it so don't go anywhere until u get this app
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally something new and worth watching. Zombies are props and the actual core is people and survival. If you haven't seen it, watch the first 2-3 episodes...
B008OOYALE|5.0|I . RECENTLY GOT TTHE GAAME A COUPLE OF, WEEKS AGO AND I . LOVE UK T IM ALREADY A LEVEL 15 GET THE GAME NOW
B009D95IJM|4.0|Cat lovers will enjoy this book -- it is  a really fun read.  I gave this as a present and the receiver began to read it right then and there, saying things like:  &#34;oh, yeah...;&#34;  &#34;I know just what the author means&#34; etc.  Cute book.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|Nice journal app, but it's the little things that kill you. In this case, it's a &quot;menu&quot; key to the lower left, next to the spacebar.  It launches all of the app's options each time your thumb slips and hits it.  If you turn the tablet sideways to give yourself more room, the &quot;delete&quot; key disappears from the keyboard.<br /><br />Overall, a nice writing/journal tool. Love the layout, stylus option and other features. Could be a &quot;five-out-of-five&quot; app  with just a few minor adjustments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it its really fun.<br />_I want to play right now. And its a free app so you don't spend money.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I've been wanting this DVD since I was a little girl and finding it made my life complete &#60;3 LOVE DAFT PUNK
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome<br />It is cool I like chicken and meat you taste good<br />Annoying orange rocks and the amazing world of gumball
B00A4SJ61W|4.0|Somewhat predictable plot, but still a lot of fun. It's definitely got some funny point to it that make it worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app EVER!! I love this app. I play it everyday. I would totally get this app if u don't have it yet. :D
0375869026|5.0|This book should be required for all fifth grade and older students.  It is a great read aloud. Be sure you leave time for discussion! I read this to sixth graders who listened without comment while I was reading.  They were enthralled.  I am glad I didn't have to read the last chapter because it touched me deeply.  This book gives students a chance to think! I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.  Thank you for your insight Ms. Pollacio!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't always take my kindle places so the kindle app for my phone has been great!  I can read anywhere and I don't seem to have any problems so far...Keeping my fingers crossed now that I said that...
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I thought this was a wonderful examination of how a terminal illness effects the loved ones of the sufferer, and the decisions he must face.  The performances were truly brilliant, particularly Cumberbatch.  I haven't wept at a movie this way in a long, long time.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Spoiler alert. Do not read further if you are going to read Requiem. So disappointed. What a cop-out ending. I feel robbed of the satisfaction of an actual resolution to this 3 book story. I feel manipulated by an author who just stopped the story instead of stepping up to the plate and giving her characters some RESOLUTION. I am now sorry I wasted hours reading these books. Shame on you Ms. Oliver.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic looking horse,you get go care for it, and would be fun for someone who loves horses and wants to be entertained
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read about this book in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, and ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting. Now I'm plotting how I can get to his book signing in Houston next week.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have always loved the stories and movies of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, so why not have the complete canon on my Kindle?  Almost 120 years later, authors, playwrights and screenplay writers are attempting to match the genius of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and falling far short of his standard.  Stick with the original!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the few shows that my wife and I can agree upon watching. It is brilliantly acted on an incredible set of an English manor house. It has characters designed to make you root for them, cry for them and in some cases cringe. Right when you think you know a character, he or she may take a sharp turn... but not too sharp as to be implausible. The only problem is that the latest season is not yet available on Amazon so you will not know the latest happenings and must avoid Facebook for fear of spoilers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nothing new to learn, easy traditional game.  Your choice of different styles to choose from.  Even old people like me get it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Like watching an accident in slow motion that involves people you love. I was physically ill reading this at times; and couldn't put it down. A testament to how many of our problems are created by our own wrong thinking; and how many blessings we receive when we choose what it is good and right and lovely. I strongly recommend this read.  .. and to cut some Rosemary, plant some daffodils.
B00425S1H8|5.0|needed this USB to RS-232 for a console port on a Cisco router.<br /><br />arrived quickly and worked without a hassle or problem.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Prior to reading, I had all doubts and skepticisms about before & after life events.  I guess I wanted to believe in something, but couldn't quite get a sense belief or trust.  After reading, this, I've amended my whole perspective on life, people, how I treat others, and how I treat myself.  I'm appreciative that Dr. Newton was brave enough to share this content in the middle of an already successful career and manage through the critics to bring it to fruition.

1400067820|5.0|I love this book! It's a worthy successor to 'The Black Swan,' exploring the characteristics that enable enterprises and individuals not only to withstand change, but to thrive in it.<br /><br />Given the large number of reviews, I will not recapitulate the book's main points.<br /><br />Instead, I would like to share some thoughts about how this book is written. This may give prospective readers a sense of what to anticipate.<br /><br />Taleb offers his fundamental insights as bases for systematic thinking. Yet he's skeptical of academic and other systems analyses, viewing them variously as overly simplistic and/or amplifying the biases or self interest of those who create or rely on them.<br /><br />I am customarily a rapid reader. Nonetheless, I read this book over the course of several weeks. I usually took it up in small bites. To me, it's like a very rich dish, one that should be savored rather than rushed. Indeed, rushing it would miss the point.<br /><br />That said, I can see that some readers may be put off by his discursive style. Taleb at times seems to be engaged in a conversation such as at an extended dinner party. He moves from areas where he may controversial yet is undeniably well grounded (such as probability analysis) to quick dives into fields where he is less knowledgeable yet apparently no less self-assured.<br /><br />I don't mind this kind of writing at all. In fact, I appreciate Taleb's notable erudition. Even if you disagree you've got a lot to think about.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you tend to be put off by that kind of intrepid moving around, consider yourself forewarned.<br /><br />In my view, the book is well worth reading and reflection for anyone. If you're focused on his primary arguments, then just read those sections. You can still get the key points without reading the various applications Taleb offers.

1616550414|5.0|I could start out this review by professing my love for the Legend of Zelda franchise and reflecting on how long it's been a part of my gaming history, but who couldn't say the same? Anyone whose gaming ambition extends beyond a few rounds of Wii Sports Tennis has likely sampled at least one of the games in the franchise. The games cater to an innate love of exploration and adventure that all humans share. Everybody loves the Legend of Zelda. It's an empirical fact. But for all the massive and enduring popularity the games enjoy, Nintendo has rarely made an effort to peel back the curtain and allow gamers a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes process and development that produces them. They tend to prefer to play everything pretty close to the vest. That's what makes the Hyrule Historia such a treat. This handsome hardcover tome is devoted entirely towards exploring and celebrating the long history of the franchise, with hundreds of images of concept designs, character art, screen captures, and other artwork from every major game in the series. The book was originally released in Japan to coincide with the release of Skyward Sword, and Dark Horse Comics and a team of English translators have finally brought it to our shores.<br />Hyrule Historia is divided into four distinct sections. The first, &#34;The Legend Begins: The World of Skyward Sword,&#34; is devoted exclusively to reproducing artwork from and commentary about that particular Zelda game. It may seem strange to devote so much of the hardcover to one entry in the franchise, but as mentioned, the Japanese release was timed more to coincide with that of the game. These pages reproduce countless images from the game, mainly character designs and sketches and renderings for the various environments. These pages include various snippets of general commentary and even comments from various members of the development team. It's easy to admire the effort the translation team put in here, as even the various scribbles and hand-written notes on the individual images have been converted from Japanese to English.<br />The second section, &#34;The History of Hyrule: A Chronology,&#34; is the material that may be of most immediate interest to hardcore Zelda fans. This section tackles the entire series and finally establishes the Nintendo-approved timeline of all the games. Beginning with Skyward Sword (which is chronologically the first Zelda game), these pages progress through the series, showcasing the many characters and trappings of the games. This section is a bit more text-heavy as it summarizes the games and examines certain shared elements and ties between the games. The writers do a reasonable job of making all the information clear and concise despite the fact that the timeline splinters into three once Ocarina of Time rolls around.<br />I'm of the mindset that the Zelda mythology is more fun without Nintendo setting everything in stone. But even so, the approach here is just open-ended enough to leave some semblance of mystery and accommodate the various other games that will eventually crop up down the road. And even if you don't care one lick about where A Link to the Past and The Minish Cap fit in relation to one another, these pages are filled with various interesting tidbits. For example, one segment explains how to translate the various Hylian runes and signs in the games.<br />The third section, &#34;Creative Footprints: Documenting 25 Years of Artwork,&#34; is far more visually-oriented. Rather than the chronological approach of the previous section, this one moves through the games more in order of release. The focus is on character and creature designs -- both rough early sketches and final promotional artwork fans will likely be familiar with. The final few pages even offer a neat collage of the evolution of the character designs for Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganondorf over the decades.<br />The early pages focused on older games like the original Legend of Zelda and A Link to the Past are easily the most fascinating. Sadly, they also comprise the smallest portion of the section. Hyrule Historia is heavily weighted towards the newer games in general, and this section seems to fixate mainly on Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. To a certain extent this makes sense. There's simply more material and existing artwork for Nintendo to utilize from these newer games. But these are also the titles that have received the most prior attention and press coverage and there many facets are more familiar to gamers. One of my few real complaints with this book is that too little attention is paid to the pre-Nintendo 64 era.<br />The fourth and final section shakes things up by providing a new manga story from artist Akira Himekawa. This manga actually has the distinction of being the &#34;first&#34; Zelda adventure. Most of it takes place long before Skyward Sword and directly sets the stage for that game and the saga of Link and Zelda in general. The English translation is a bit clunky at times, but in general the story is an entertaining and thought-provoking look at the early days of Hyrule. I do wish the entire comic could have been printed in color rather than the traditional manga route of coloring the first handful of pages and switching to black and white for the rest. With a hardcover of this size, simple black and white art simply doesn't do the format justice.<br />One fun added touch is the inclusion of a foreword from Shigeru Miyamoto and an afterword from Eiji Aonuma. As the two men most closely involved with the franchise over the years, it's nice to read their thoughts on the book and their reflections on the past 25 years of Zelda gaming.<br />On that note, the quality and construction of Hyrule Historia is very impressive, especially considering the fairly modest price tag. The book is roughly a foot tall, similar in height but not quite as wide as Dark Horse's various Library Edition graphic novels. The binding is tight, and the pages are thick and glossy. Just watch out for the occasional black pages in the table of contents and so forth, as they tend to pick up fingerprints pretty easily. Even the cover is classy, eschewing a dust jacket and presenting a green motif with gold embossing. One nitpick -- the Dark Horse logo on the spine looks a bit tacky alongside the rest of the text. Overall, the quality and construction were impressive enough that it's actually a bit surprising that Dark Horse is only charging $35 for it. Many online retailers like Amazon are barely charging $20. At that price, any complaints about the contents almost become moot.<br />Almost, but not quite. As mentioned, the book has a perplexing fascination with the newer Zelda games at the expense of the NES, SNES, and Game Boy era. What's more, the book makes no acknowledgement of the Philips CDi games. Yes, those games are legendary for being awful, but that fact alone justifies their inclusion. It would have been interesting to see how the contemporary Zelda crew look back on those titles and whether there are any connections to be drawn between them and the Nintendo-developed games. There's a small section detailing &#34;elusive and rare Zelda titles,&#34; but it only references the Gamecube-exclusive Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition and the two BS games that were offered on the Satellaview service. Nor does the book touch on the old animated series or any other multimedia spinoffs. The focus is very insular and devoted almost exclusively to the Nintendo-developed games. A bit wider perspective on the franchise and its impact would have been nice.<br />One other recurring problem is that the art rarely takes full advantage of the page real estate. Hyrule Historia is more about quantity than quality in that regard. You'll rarely find a page that doesn't have at least three or four separate pieces of art on display. Many times I found myself wishing than a particularly dynamic character design or interesting concept painting could have been blown up to full size. Naturally, Nintendo has to be efficient with their page design or risk winding up with a finished product in the thousands of pages. But at the very least, the occasional full-page image or double page spread could have added some extra visual spice to the book., and the pages are thick and glossy.

B005LAIHR2|4.0|This pertains to the extended version of the film and not to the play:<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of musicals, in general, but I do love 80s \\"hair\\" metal. Those who lived through the '80s know that serious things were happening in the world and in their own lives, yet they probably also remember turning to those songs featured in the film to cope with what was happening. This is what the movie focuses on--big dreams, glamor, escapism--the stuff of everyday life if you were a teenager during this time period. I love how the film captures the idea of reaching for one's dreams and seeing those dreams fail to materialize as you had hoped. The film captures perfectly the feeling that most young people had during this time of transcending one's current situation and becoming someone important and special. As I watched this film, I kept thinking of hopes and dreams of those featured in The Decline of Western Civilization, Part II.<br /><br />While it is true that sometimes you don't know whether the scenes are meant ironically or seriously, this just further captures the feel of the late 1980s and the individuals involved in the scene on the Sunset Strip. The musicians took their music seriously--whether out of an artistic stance or out of the drive to achieve fame and money--usually  both. But inherent within the genre itself was a sense of playfulness and of blurring the line between reality and fantasy. Also evident is the power of record companies to shape and control everything about an artist's image. In 1987, several of the metal bands were struggling to make it, so you see this strange combination of seediness and glamor-- the reality of their situations versus where they aspired to be. The movie portrays this well.<br /><br />The right songs were used in just the right places, and for the right characters, to convey the emotions of the characters in a given scene. People have complained about Julianne Hough's singing, saying she sounds too country, but the character is from Oklahoma, and, as anyone who was listening to the radio in a conservative rural area in this time period can attest, country stations outnumbered rock stations. Record and cassette collections were often the only way that kids could listen to their favorite bands; similarly, rural teens who were lucky enough to have cable television or a satellite feed could see their favorite bands on MTV, which did nothing to dispel the notion that the entire music scene was glitzy and alluring.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I agree that Cruise gives an amazing performance. He portrays depth and intelligence in a character that the audience could, otherwise, easily dismiss as a spoiled, hedonistic burnout. Plus, he is funny. The choreography is great, particularly the Venus Club dancers, the Cruise/Hough number, and Hough's number at the Hollywood sign. It's impressive that the cast themselves, including Alec Baldwin, sing.<br /><br />Overall, the film is great fun, which, I think, is how it was intended.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I can't put this book down.<br />A perfect blend of history and today lives.<br />The books is about survival, in past as well as today.<br />The pain of hatred, causes wars.<br />After reading this book, you wonder why all this awful, needs to<br />happen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate and dependable.  Is downloaded on both my Galaxy s2 and my Kindle Fire.  Best of all, it's free!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book!<br />The author wrote this story as if you watching from the clouds.<br />This book is so interesting. All the characters were interesting<br />and add such flavor to this magnificant story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great entertainment, I highly recommend that you watch this show. provides a perspective to a time that is rarely  captured in film or on TV
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|certainly not scathe.  have no idea what the point is other than running down a road collecting pages.  not even remotely fun.  don't waste your time
B008G59IKO|3.0|I got \\"Uno\\" and it was a pretty decent pop-rock album that succeeded for the most part in what it was supposed to accomplish. When I popped in \\"Dos\\", I wasn't expecting the old Green Day or even \\"American Idiot\\"-esque quality music; I just wanted to hear some good tunes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Dos\\" has some really good songs on it and the musicianship is really good across the board but there are some songs here that are either not fully thought-out or are just a complete waste of time. This album is 39 minutes and for 5 songs to be sub-par, it pretty much narrows it down to an EP. I actually almost felt cheated the first time I played this album the whole way through; it took me 2 more listens to appreciate a couple of the tracks more.<br /><br />The following songs here are the ones that I really think should've been left off:<br />\\"F*** Time\\" (kind of a blues rock number that has potential but never really takes off), \\"Make-out Party\\", \\"Stray Heart\\" (this also had potential but the lyrics feel generic and everything feels forced), \\"Lady Cobra\\", and \\"Nightlife\\" (I understand this is supposed to be experimental or something but it fails miserably and should've been a B-Side at most).<br /><br />One thing I'll say for this album is that the songs have more edge to them than the ones on \\"Uno\\" for the most part. Also, the good songs on this are really good. Songs like \\"Lazy Bones\\", \\"Wow! That's Loud\\", and \\"Amy\\" are really amazing songs. The band really should learn a lesson here with this album: quality over quantity. If they keep releasing albums as uneven as this, I might not bother with Green Day anymore sadly.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan of Green Day, you'll most likely pick this up regardless of a review.<br /><br />If you're a casual Green Day fan, there a couple good songs on here but I wouldn't recommend buying this new at full price; I would buy it used at the price that an EP costs.<br /><br />Mediocre with flashes of greatness.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I suck at games but I like this one.. wen I gets fast it tricky but u will get the hang of it..
B009329ZF2|5.0|computers made most of it but over all it was a good movie to watch I liked it visited the Alabama
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We are very picky about movies but we love this one, smart, funny, good storyline , good morel of the story. A good one in a long time
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love this movie!  My husband and I watch it every Christmas season!  Its funny, the acting is great, and we have yet to get tired of it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought the book was very compelling, considering that the author came from such a scientific background and had by his own admission always been leery about these kinds of experiences that he had heard about at times from his patients. The book reminded me of another one I recently read about a NDE by Anita Manjoori, who describes a very similar experience in her book, &#34; Dying to be me&#34;. These experiences certainly are reminiscent of those described by the great Holy men of India, who referred to them as Nirvirkalpa Samadhi, the Highest state of Consciousness. It sounds to me that the author came close to this level of consciousness.<br />I hope he can continue to benefit from this profound journey into the depths of his psyche.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Loved the packing, box and presentations. Well packed and good timing.the box and gift inside made this movie set a great gift collection. I ordered one for a friend.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults. It is very entertaining for children and the dialogue is also clever
B000PMG16U|5.0|The item came as expected. Completed and within the time advised. Made a little boys birthday a happy day as he just discovered Star Wars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A great app for any tablet,  in my opinion.  Now you never have to guess any more about how much of. a charge you have left in your device; get on with it fore-armed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Goodness gracious! This season keeps getting better! The show still keeps me on the edge of my seat. Andrea in Woodbury, Michonne joining the group, the psychotic Governor and Rick still plugging away. I will continue to watch the show and this isn't even my type of show since zombies scare me but the family that they developed and all of the things aside from the zombies kept me interested. I like when they kill the zombies since it gets out some aggression for both us viewers and the characters. Keep it up AMC!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The book was more about the authors life than it was about his &#34;heavenly&#34; experience.  I could not recommend the book.
B008GAXV84|5.0|I dare say that most people will have at least some of the works presented here on different recordings, I know I have, so why buy this box, well it fills in a few gaps for me, as I imagine it would for others, also, for those coming to Borodin afresh, it offers a wonderful survey of the composers music.<br />The first two discs offer you the Symphonies and while they do not quite come up to the sheer passion you get from Evgeny Svetlanov's Melodiya recordings, Mark Ermler and the Bolshoi Orchestra give it a good go. Discs 3 to 5 offer you chamber music, some of which was new to me, the standout works are the famous string quartets, but here the String Quintet and Piano Quintet were a revelation to me, all the chamber music receive first rate recordings and even if the quartets don't quite live up to the famous recording by the Borodin Quartet, the performance here is still very enjoyable. Discs 6 and 7 offer both the complete piano music and songs with much to enjoy, not least the composers own remarkable transcription for piano 4 hands of In the Steppes of Central Asia. The final three discs of the set gives the listener a reasonable recording of Borodin's operatic masterpiece Prince Igor, which while a good performance, originally on Sony, the Bulgarian forces under Emil Tchakarov, the recorded sound is a little recessed at times and I found myself having to crank up the volume.<br />All the recordings were made between 1987 and 2008, and apart from the problem discussed with Prince Igor, have good recorded sound. The notes, as with all Brilliant box sets, is very limited, although what you get is quite informative, full texts and translations for the songs and Igor are also available online.<br />This is a highly recommendable set, one which will give the listener hours of enjoyment.
0385341008|5.0|Brilliant writing style--through short, simple letters we delve deeply into the lives and feelings of many different characters and come away feeling that we know and love them all.  For a seemingly light and witty book, it addresses some very deep and dark issues.  The strength and connection of the people is the heart of the book.  I want to visit Guernsey!!  I wish these were real people.  One of my favorite books of the year.
0345803507|5.0|Love them all!
1439102813|5.0|I've often asked myself what it must feel like to have Alzheimer's.  Do you know?  Can you tell you're changing?  How frustrating is it?  How do you relate to those around you?  What is the progression?  This book answered all those questions and more.  It was so intelligently yet caringly written.  I could relate to all the characters and understand their reactions.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Funniest show ever! I only discovered it this year...yes i am behind the times....but I cant get enough of Sheldon Cooper!

B004RL9T50|4.0|I think its been a common theme among animated movies recently to make the bad guy into the good guy. Anyways it was a fun movie and a good time pass.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|My husband and I wasted our money on this. We only watched it for about 20 minutes and turned it off. I don't like Anna Karenina done campy.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|They could have done more with it.  The story is interesting, but character development is a bit subpar. Overall enjoyable, but not memorable.
B006GLT8FK|1.0|As funny & clever as The Whole 9 Yards was, is as unfunny & unclever (not to mention crass & stupid) as The Whole 10 Yards is.  Nuff said.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|Although some question the validity of the events of this adventure, i do not care. It brought joy and sadness and a new drive to my own obstacles in life. Its definitely worth the read!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Its a great idea for a SF story. If read without overthinking what is happening it makes very entertaining reading..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it love it love it. Everyone should have it. Of course it's a great read and the audio for me is the best part. Come on it's the Bible, wonderful!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game. Great game for a fan of horses...she loves grooming her horses and participating in competitions.

B003MC5N28|2.0|The ending was not what I was expecting. Left me hanging. Don't think I'll be ready the others in this series.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|This movie was well done from beginning to end.  Everything worked together from the music to pace and dialogue.  Highly recommend it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great for action if you're into that sort of thing. It also has a great story line. It's a must see.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A befitting chapter in the series. As always, the author keeps the reader engaged in the story, with complex characters and even harder-to-follow storylines. My only real complaint is that at times, it can be unforgivingly hard to keep track of everyone.<br />Most frustratingly, the author continues his habit of writing twists that make you want to hurl your book/device across the room and never read anything or trust anyone ever again.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Cause it just won't work. I can't seem to get this thing going. I think it would be a worth having app, if it works.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro is new to me but I am hooked. This was a great read. Some stories will get you thinking for quite a while.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I was thumbing through the options for instant videos and I came across this documentary holding steady at 5/5 stars with over 320 reviews.  I thought &#34;How on earth does this have THAT good of a rating?&#34;  So I researched who this guy was, and read dozens of reviews on here about this selection, still not believing a documentary of all things could have this good of an overall review.<br /><br />Yep, it's that good.  5/5 stars by me and it deserves every star it has received.  May this man live forever through his music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't remember ever being so excited about a television show. Great writing and the actors are fantastic!! Anticipating  the episode when Andrea dies!!!! Off with her head!!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book has all the good points of 50 Shades but on a bit higher reading level and less corny. If you like Christian, you'll love Gideon.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love this new group and this cd is great. Will enjoy keeping up with what they record next! Would reccomend.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I only heard one song, &#34;Hold On&#34; and like it so when I listened to the whole cd I was a bit annoyed when all the songs sound pretty much the same. the singer's voice is amazing and she sounds a lot like Janis Joplin. unfortunately the music seems like one big song and a little the same melody. overall I like it and it's ok for driving but it's not the type od cd I would listen to over and over again.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|I loved reading this entire book, up until the very end.  I couldn't wait to see how it would turn out, but I found the ending to be a bit of a cop out.
B005URRCUY|5.0|the cd is packed with good music. I love most of the songs and listen to it in the car. if you like the black keys then you will like this whole cd.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|good story, entertaining and suspenseful; I bought the kindle edition and have no complaints whatsoever. Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting series.
0875428940|5.0|I am currently learning the Tarot and my teacher chose this deck for us because it does not use any form of religion in the art. the deck is beautiful and easy to understand. so far I am enjoying learning about each card. the cards are also self explanatory and the art and imagery are just beautiful. seems like a perfect deck to start my tarot journey.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|purchased as a gift for a die-hard-trekkie, this did not disappoint. It would be nice to have it made of a heaver material, maybe metal because the plastic is, I hate to say it, cheesy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I happened to see Doris Kearns Goodwin on Sunday's 'Meet The Press' and the moderator mentioned her book and the current blockbuster film &#34;Lincoln&#34;, and I was immediately curious about the nature of her writing; after all, there must be a thousand books about Lincoln out there.  Well, I was not disappointed, DKG brought to life the sense and the goings on of political intrigues of the time.  It took only a few pages to get the full understanding of the book's title, especially how Honest Abe, with practicality and good common sense, realised and brought together his administration.  A country divided!  A President for the ages!  Some how, right prevailed, a 'new' America established and strengthened.  It is no small exaggeration to credit Providence for delivering Mr. Lincoln.  An easy read for all - consider today's political climate, and only wonder.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I'm excited that this program actually installed on the cruz tablet.  I hope that everything will run smoother now. I can hardly wait to try it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I love the old school bonds but this is a great film. It reminds me a lot of Nolan's Batman.
B009O2XY12|1.0|downloaded just fine  however, wouldn't install..  another really fun looking game that I didn't get to play...I'm bummed ...I keep downloading in case one will eventually install.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I really hope more styling tools, accessories, shampoos, and other hair care products are added such as hair spray,  gel, mousse, rollers, brush,  crimper, more colors, the option to dye roots,  muddled, or tips and much more! I think the more to a Boca adds, the better it will become!!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|couldn't install it on my tablet after downloading...there is no way to tell if it will install when you download it..it looks really fun though
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This series has been a favorite for my wife and I to watch for decades!  It tracks the history of the Bellamy family through several decades, tying them in to historical events such as the sinking of the Titanic, wars, and changing social values.  It is produced in excellent fashion.  One of the best attributes  is that the episodes don't necessarily need to be watched in order.  Although they are produced in chronilogical order, each episode's story stands alone.<br /><br />We look forward to watching the entire series again, for the third time since seeing it new in the Eighties!<br /> A side note: we purchased the sequel DVD, and while it was &#34;good&#34; it did not live up to the high standards of the original series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really liked this game until the cruz tablet made it disappear one day.  I could never find it at the app store again so I could download it again..great game
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|downloaded it after reading all the good things about but I am having a hard doing anything on it and it closes constantly. Not good at...
B004UID2LC|1.0|This did not download or install at all on my cruz tablet..I used to have youtube already on it but it disappeared so I tried to load this and it didn't work at all
030759565X|4.0|I love the recipes AND the explanations..........If you can follow directions, you will have a wonderful success with any recipe in this book.
B005LAII8A|3.0|All Sci-fi fans know of the time paradox.  So, a story where he goes back to kill himself...sort of like &#34;12 Monkey's&#34; and other time travel films is not too original.  Bruce Willis is excellent as always.
160774273X|4.0|This is a must have for those of us who enjoy great bread! Very doable at home, with super results.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Interesting take on Batman the golden years. The not so hidden anti-conservative message was a little heavy handed.<br />Good story no matter what.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Reminds me of F.E.A.R.<br /><br />Scares me the same way that did.<br /><br />Two bugs playing so far that I came across.  One when walking across the road, I went through a crack in the map somehow and fell endlessly below the map.  Had to restart.  The other was when the guy popped up close, the screen flickered a ton like it does when he's in view but my vision never returned.  Nor was it game over.  The left joystick was still usable, but no direction helped.  Had to restart again.<br /><br />Other than a few bugs, it definitely fits as the scariest mobile game.<br />Good job dev.<br /><br />Worth the dollar!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Nothing else can be said about this series.  It has complex characters and plots that keep you watching and manages to avoid the usual traps of expected outcomes.  The talent in this show is truely stunning!
B0014BY72Q|3.0|It was very entertaining and the movie had a good plot and I would buy the movie on video... Thanks
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Thank God this was free! I don't usually get games like this but I read the reviews and figured I'd give slender a shot. WoW what a disappointment..gives you no instruction you have to maneuver the guy with ur finger in the middle of the screen and you roam aimlessly in the woods...pretty lame. I decided to read all the reviews and sure enough they all sound almost identical...the ones that I did believe we're the ones that sounded more like mine lol..Not scary At All.. Probably not even for a teeny bopper.<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME..THAT WAS 25 mins I can never get back lol..
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best game of the world and its first time in the world and its first year of the most popular
0800141849|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and have watched it many times; however, the adult language in the movie has kept me from sharing it with family.  The story is of two professors who date, marry for companionship but Barbara changes her mind and wants more out of marriage.  He inturns realizes that he really does love her after she moves back with her mother, and can't live without her.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I loved it. It was hysterical . AWESOME funny  .Oh how funny it was. And it taught me something but we all know what it is so why wast time knowing what it
B00992CF6W|1.0|If you buy this YOUR as dumb as this hard to control and a limit to space please don't buy this rip off
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so totally awesome because it has different themes for different seasons. The only bad thing is some of the boards and characters cost a little to much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool they have characters and boards and different holiday decorations and themes and eggs for the Easter one get 100 to get the chicky board and you can get three characters from the mystery box spike and etc. You should get subway surfers it's really cool.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is better than pages in a boring dictionary on searching words that you can't see get this book now
B002ZBZFNY|3.0|The movies meanders. The movie is more a character study about an alien than about scifi.<br />Even though it was slow and unsatisfying, I watched it through. I was hoping it would go<br />somewhere. It didn't.  It's a \\"B movie\\".
B009KUANWG|5.0|MY IN LOVE WITH AMAZON. the price the song and it's ready for me when ever I want it. I cant do with out this site.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Okay my opinion is this game is awesome but a lil spends but worth it I toataly recommend it so yeah get the game you will luv it
B00AVY5RSK|5.0|I'll keep my review short and sweet. I love Jane Austen and most of the books I have read by her.<br />This book tells a tale of maybe not a\\"fairytale\\"ending. It it's a must read!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A very moving story about a great songwriter who doesnt realize his dreams for 30 years.  I highly recommend this award winning documentary.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Awesome game I can't stop playing I haven't found another game that beats this one! I com wish they would give more lives but krystyn still rocks! Highly recomend
B002G1YPH0|3.0|This heat sink is so tall I had to cut the top off of it so that it would fit inside my mid-tower case.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|If you have Alzheimer's in your family this is something you must read.  Even if you don't, it is a beautifully written book full of compassion and insight as to this horrific disease.  It is a first person narrative of loss.  Beautiful indeed.
B000VZYPB4|4.0|What a great show.... Can't believe I didn't discover it before.  The action comes from who the characters are rather than overly contrived plots.  The acting-- especially Sheldon and Penny-- is very good.  Many of the segments are movie worthy.  Also interesting exploration of the adult Aspie and the network of people he's found who help take care of him.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|For us it was Cabaret revisted.  I know it is an older movie, but it has held up well.  Lize Minnelli cannot be beat and we just loved Joel Grey all over again.
B009NI46F0|4.0|Funny, sweet, compelling story of sorority girl going to Harvard.  I think it tells the bigger story of anyone who has potential that even they may not have discovered.  You don't know what you're capable of until you've tried it.  Feminist in a good way.  Supporting actors and writing are both good, especially the manicurist who becomes her friend.  Loved it, just showed it to my 11 year old daughter, and she loved it too.
B0084670FU|1.0|I know this movie was rated well, but it was just too hard to stay with in the beginning.  We just gave up.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Off key synths, ridiculous lyrics about love and lust, and whiny vocals, but damnit, I love this album and I love the spirit behind it.  How many releases by male artists do we have to endure who are whiny, synthy, and off key?  No more, I say!! Let the females speak!!  And Tegan and Sara do, and do it superbly!!  I have had this on repeat, the whole album, since purchasing.  I got the chance to see these women a few months ago, and if the chance comes by you as well -- GO!  They are not only fun to listen to, but they are hilarious!!!  Seriously, these two need to be on prime time with their banter and wit!!  Women ROCK!!
B007WPM7SO|5.0|We enjoyed this adaptation of the book by Sebastian Faulks.  It was a long book and I wasn't sure how they would be able to present it as a movie.  I thought they did an excellent presentation and I think they portrayed the story well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its such a cool and time wasting app! you should buy it! its so fun! its totally worth it! I play it all the time!
6305291446|5.0|I like most others refuse to acknowledge the pile of crap that is Halloween Resurrection.  Or, better said, I acknowledge its existence, yet think of it like Halloween III, except with Michael Myers.<br /><br />This movie pretends like none of the other sequels existed, and brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.  It is revealed she faked her death after Halloween II and has been living in hiding ever since.  She is the Head Mistress at a private school and has a 17 year old son.  Michael discovers her location by tracking down the nurse from Halloween I and II (in a cameo role that likely would have gone to Donald Pleasence had he not passed away), and tries to finish the job he started 20 years ago.<br /><br />The things I like about the movie is that they made the character of Laurie a strong heroine figure.  She never bought that he was dead.  While she did still drop the knife a couple times she did end up picking up an axe. The entire set up to their coming face to face (in a great scene) was her realizing she would have to confront him and not just run away.  The movie also paid nice homage to the late Donald Pleasence in the beginning even having a voice over from the original movie.  You really can look at this movie as creating a Halloween Trilogy.  While I did not dislike Halloween IV and V, and would had been fine if they incorporated some of that story in as well, Halloween VI and VIII are better left ignored.  If you are a fan of the original movie this one is a must have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is my favorite game in the whole world!!!awesomeee Temple Run 2 is wayyy better than regular temple run ...
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Not Hopkins best performance.  Drags a bit at times even though it is an intriguing story of Hitch and his wife and their relationship.
B000AAF1U4|1.0|The movie didn't work. At first glimpse of it the movie had some kind of greasy residue on it. After cleaning it IT STILL DIDN'T WORK and had disappointed kids!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great fun filled action packed game that everyone should get. At least everyone should consider. It can enterentertain you for hours.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|If you are a Hitchcock fan, this is a must see. Women with glasses, greens and reds and other primary colors as symbols, squared framing, and of course the blondes and voyuerism. Helen Mirren did a superb job as Alma and Anthony Hopkins did a good Hitch after the first 10 minutes. I will admit I thought he was playing Winston Churchill at first. The opening of the film is great. The soundtrack plays great homage to Bernard Herrmann. It seems I rarely enjoy a movie these days, but I really enjoyed this one.
B00AHXIC50|2.0|Maybe it was overproduced? Overpolished?  I just didn't get any really feeling from this album which was disappointing since I really like Bruno Mars.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I enjoy this game while waiting for train or riding metronome rail. it makes the time fly and is not diificult to play.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Who would have thought an unknown U.S. artist could have such a huge impact in another part of the world? A strange and wonderful and unique and well-told story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is fun creative and bottom less if u like temple run u will love this game best luck -funny :)))
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the realistic set up of this game!  I am looking to own a horse of my own &amp; this app is a great tool to demonstrate knowledge of horse care.  I love the choices offered with tack and apparel.  This is a very engaging game that is hard to put down!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I love Supernatural...delivery was a little early, which is always nice and it is what i wanted, no problems! :)
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|This is about the stupidest movies ever.  The director is clearly out of ideas here.  Please, don't waste your time with this garbage!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I play a lot of casual games and most make you spend real cash to continue leveling up or adding stuff to the game.  This game is not that way at all which is very nice!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Always good to Clint, boy is he getting old, sad to see but nice that he is still out there!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game for those who love thinking ahead - developing a strategy. Very thought provoking and I love trying to match the most efficient moves.
B000IDCJK8|5.0|Clasic Clint, watch it over and over again, no one like him in this genre.  Wish there were more like this.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Moving rock forward.  With listen to.  One helluva voice on this lady!<br />You just gotta listen to list to enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my new favorite game to play! And this beats any game I normally play. I am hoping for a number 2. So there will be more challenges!
0446585041|4.0|The book at points had me in stitches, always enjoy Ellen's humor....I have not read her previous books, so can't compare....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Like the movie because it's not like every other princess story.  She an independent girl who loves to play just like my daughter.
B0095R76EW|3.0|A so-so story and entertaining to watch.  Not thrilled with the acting or the plot but did enjoy the story and how things turned out.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|OK movie, but like the music more.  The movie is a bit slow and sappy, but the music is fun.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great Book.  Enjoyed the story and suspense.  Recommend it to anyone who likes Tom Clancy thrillers.  Easy process for ordering through Amazon.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Full original version, not the edited American version.  Very cool.  No problems with the feed. It's smaller on the outside.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Have always enjoyed the series and look forward to other features provided through Amazon and Netflix.  Recommend to people who like this series and others like it.  Easy process in ordering through Amazon Prime.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|This is a great movie, one of John Wayne's non Westerns. Comedy with a family plot about animals with John Wayne.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I are hooked! Can't wait for the next season to start. Intersting to see how different life was back then.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Never gonna read any books only these one .l°¥€ this book favorite book ever never forget it will always be my favorite
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just using the four functions for now -- but the layout and visuals are absolutely gorgeous.  It has become my favorite calculator.  :-)
B00A4OALL0|5.0|WOW. It is so rare to have an album knock you back in your seat. In the 60's and 70's we were drop jaw ,recording after recording, and couldn't wait to hear what would come next from many artists. This set made me feel the same way,in the gut. Of course,given his age, I just hope there will be a next. For now, this stands as one of Shorter's greatest achievements. It would have knocked us flat 40 years ago,when music was going through a revolution of sorts. Play this next to Super Nova, Moto Grosso, or Odyssey of Iska, examples of his most experimental prior to WP. Pegasus will be considered as one of Shorter's monumental pieces of music. Worth the wait.
