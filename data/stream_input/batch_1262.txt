B004DK5CW4|5.0|We saw this movie in the actual theaters - it was GREAT - INTENSE and highly motivational.  I LOVE that this is based on a true story & believe me, most of this movie is totally accurate to the real events.  We visited the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame a couple years ago BEFORE this movie even came out or was advertised & so we were already informed of this story from that visit.  You will laugh, cry, cheer, jump up & out of your seat and you will just LOVE to watch it!  And let's NOT forget the HUMOR...John Malkovich is GREAT, he is the comic relief & yet plays a sensitive side of the story (for he & the world sees himself as a total loser).    They did a great job! Now THIS is a REAL family movie that IS completely family friendly with regards to morals, perspectives, what is right & wrong & just the plot of the story line - it was real, not fake.  Just an amazing story.  I would not recommend it for young audiences of younger than 7 or 8 years old as some of the scenes are very \\"intense\\".  I do not support \\"gambling\\" of any sort, but if you look past the gambling part, it is still a great \\"underdog\\" story of human nature & life of a horse athlete.  I would just simply state - amazing movie!  Don't miss this one.
B000002GBD|5.0|this ofcourse is a classic album which arrived on time and ofcourse people will talk about the songs hair of the dog and love hurts but the ones that stood out for me are beggers day and rose in the heathers this will alway be a great album for old and new generation especially with the deep vocals which are a good comparison to brian johnson
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Every time I finish something written by Stephen King I think \\"he can't get any better than this\\" - and I'm almost always proven wrong. This is one example.  11.22.69's is part a thriller, a beautiful love story and even a smattering of sci-fi thrown in at the end. The ending brought some tears to my eyes - and not many books do that to me. I loved the way he connected his other great novel \\"It\\" with this one (Ritchie from the ditchie and Bevy from the levy). This book was quite a treat - and I loved every page.

B005SMGRH0|5.0|If you have ever been curious about Gorillaz, their music, and their art, this collection is the perfect starter.<br /><br />First off, you get all of the singles that they have released from their first 3 ablums: [[ASIN:B004SBQTHU Gorillaz [Explicit]]], [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Demon Days]], and [[ASIN:B0035G9ABQ Plastic Beach]] (no singles from their 4th album, [[ASIN:B004OFWLPE The Fall]], are in this collection).  Also included are some remixes, such as 19-2000 Soulchild remix, and also [[ASIN:B0046V11DO Doncamatic]], a Plastic Beach single that wasn't released with the album.  It's great that the remixes and Doncramatic were included as these aren't played on the radio much.<br /><br />Secondly, if you get the CD/DVD combo, you get a DVD of most of the video singles, plus some live performances, even one that hasn't been released on DVD before (i.e., the Roundhouse performance).  So not only do you see the amazing art that Jamie Hewlett created, but you get to see Damon Albarn and his gang doing what they do best: perform the music!<br /><br />Last, but not least, the artwork on the cover spans all 3 studio albums (or phases, for the Gorillaz fans in the know) from Jamie Hewlett.  This is another great introduction to the art, but it also let's you see how the \\"band\\" has evolved over the last 10 years.<br /><br />All in all, even for the die-hard Gorillaz fans (like myself), pick up this CD/DVD combo, even if you already have all the songs.
B00664BWI8|5.0|I am not in the habit of buying episodes but I just can't get enough of this show it just gets better and better.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband because he broke his old pair, his fault. He was happy because it was exactly the same kind he had before and I got them cheaper than he paid. The happiness lasted until he hooked them up.  There was a weird crunching sound coming from the left earphone only.  The right one was fine. I'm immediatly returning this. I read the reviews of other people but I thought it was an isolated problem because I also have a headset and have no problems.
B00008IHN1|5.0|ok I am one of those people who appriciate coorinated marching and the sound of a good drumline puts a smile on my face..

B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles were challenging the music was relaxing at the same time. The game design was very satisfying. Being able to g through walls, but not when there were blocks the other side, sometimes would make me forget that I could. Dynamics like this kept me thinking (excuse the pun) outside the box. This was probably the best free game I have ever seen. Levels were increasingly hard, but never too much so, so that your level of frustration was more akin to the affection of a good challenge. Great game. Loved it!

B006G7R2KW|2.0|This season has had its ups and downs.  I can't imagine why they would carry it into one more year, but they are, and I'm pretty sure that I won't be watching until it comes out on Netflix streaming, if at all.<br /><br />That said, this review is starred only for this episode.  It is obvious that they want to build to a big end.  This episode does everything but stand on its head to set up the final episode.  I believe they knew they didn't have enough plot built previous to this episode to have a \\"spectacular\\" finale, and they probably have been scrambling to segue into the next season.<br /><br />What came out of this episode was a garbled, predictable story-line...just as predictable as knowing Clay has a further role at the end of the last episode.  Of course, mayhem will break loose in the finale.  Just like an episode of Columbo or Murder, She wrote, the formula will take us where the writers and producers want us, no matter how transparent it may be.<br /><br />There have been some fairly decent episodes this year, and there are actors from Deadwood, a truly great series here, as well as Danny Trejo, \\"Tortuga\\" from Breaking Bad and other choice roles, down-playing his skills, but stil interesting.  It's been a better season than last year overall, but this episode is just a soap opera stinker.  Way, way too formulaic.

B001EN71CW|3.0|First of all, the three stars are for the blu-ray transfer. The show itself deserves TEN stars! (and Mr. Murdoch has a reserved seat in h*** for canceling it!) Depending on the individual episodes, some of the conversion to blu-ray was ok. However some sections are grainy at best. Given the age of this series and the fact that it was made for TV and not the big screen, it's to be expected. If you can catch this set on sale, get it. Otherwise, don't waste your money.
1455510319|4.0|In a difficult economy, the criminal defense business is not all that it used to be and so Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer, is reduced to defending clients who are about to lose their homes to foreclosure. One of his clients, a not very pleasant woman named Lisa Trammel is not content simply to let Mickey wage the legal battle on her behalf. She begins her own campaign on line and in the streets to defend herself and others against what she perceives to be the villainy of the greedy bankers who are attempting to kick them out of their homes.<br /><br />Lisa becomes enough of a nuisance that WestLand Financial, the bank that is attempting to foreclose on her home, secures a restraining order against her. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell Bondurant, the banker who heads the mortgage department at WestLand, is savagely killed in the bank's parking garage. Critical evidence points to Lisa Trammel as the killer, but she insists that she has respected the restraining order and that she was nowhere near the bank the morning that Bondurant was murdered.<br /><br />Lisa retains Mickey to defend her against the murder charge and Mickey suddenly finds himself back in court, doing what he loves. He can hardly love his client, though, who turns out to be a major pain in the neck and who complicates the defense in a variety of ways. Mickey constructs an alternate theory to explain the crime and the question is whether he can get a jury to buy his suggestion before his client torpedoes the case and Mickey along with it.<br /><br />This is another cleverly constructed legal thriller from Michael Connelly with a \\"ripped-from-the-headlines\\" storyline. The courtroom scenes, in particular, are very well done and will keep you on the edge of your seat. As in all of the Haller books, there is also an ongoing subplot involving Mickey's relationship with his ex-wife and their daughter. Connelly's fans and others who enjoy legal thrillers but who have not yet made Mickey Haller's acquaintance are sure to enjoy this page-turner of a book.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FARTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE BOOK ENDS!<br /><br />As a side note, one of the things that intrigues me about this series is the fact that in these books, as in real life, virtually all of the clients that Mickey Haller sees as a defense attorney are actually guilty. This is still a fairly unusual thing to happen in a legal thriller. This genre originated, as a practical matter, with Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason series. Mason remains probably the most famous fictional criminal defense attorney of all, and yet amazingly all eighty-five of the clients he defended in this series were actually innocent!<br /><br />This has continued to be the case with most other books like this. As the book progresses, our defense attorney hero must not only conduct a brilliant defense of his or her client, but he or she must also expose the Real Killer in the process.<br /><br />To Connelly's credit, he doesn't do this. Still, though, he seems uncomfortable with the idea of allowing his hero, Attorney Haller, to exercise his considerable talents in the service of allowing a bad person to escape his or her just desserts. In the last Haller novel, Connelly addressed the issue by allowing Haller to switch sides and join the prosecution. In this book, as in The Lincoln Lawyer, we have another twist at the end that allows Mickey to achieve justice in spite of the brilliant defense he has mounted. To my mind, this tactic worked well the first time around, but I'm not so sure it's as plausible here. Connelly may have resolved the issue with another totally unexpected twist at the end of this book, and it will be interesting to see the direction that the author takes Haller in the future.s page-turner of a book.     ***SPOILER ALERT*** PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FARTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE BOOK ENDS!

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|As soon as I heard this album, I loved it, and I knew that Metallica fans would hate it. If you want to hear Metallica covering the same old ground trying to make a buck, this album is not for you. Give them props for breaking out of the mold and actually doing something with artistic merit. The slow-core grinding meshes perfectly with Lou Reed's masterfully nihilistic lyrical imagery. This is not a rock album so much as it is performance art. They are not pandering to their fans, or any demographic, and I find it impossible to believe that any of them did this project with the goal of making money. It is always best to approach any work without expectations of what it should or should not be. If this had come out in 1983, or with any other band, it would be critically acclaimed.My only criticism is that some of the tracks drone on too long, but this is also part of the point of the whole thing. This is NOT a Metallica album, or strictly a Lou Reed album. It is something different, which I for one find refreshing.
1451627289|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Time travel, political assassination, space-time continuum, The Butterfly Effect, vigilanty justice, a love story and more rolled into a very entertaining and thought provoking 850 page read.

In fact it was so horrible that the editing actually physically made me ill.  (YES I BARFED)  If you have seen the movie then I am sure you understand, if you haven't seen it then you really don't want to know what I mean.  I have never dropped acid or eaten any magic mushrooms but apparently the director overdosed on all available hallucinogenics while making this movie.  WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!! YES IT IS THAT BAD.....
B00364K6YW|5.0|I adore \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" the book.  This version with Colin Firth is great.  All of the charaters are cast VERY well.  You will fall in love with Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.

Do yourself a favor, buy rechargeable batteries and a charger and save yourself the headache of this poorly designed piece of crap.

I saw this on a recent trip to Amsterdam, but didn't buy it there, because I simply didn't want to pack a heavy book, but I ordered it from Amazon upon my return, and it is AMAZING!!  Full of some excellent photos, as well as some mind blowing re-pros of old concert posters, and the hand written lyrics are really cool to have. Any and ALL hard core fans of Queen should have this book.  I sure miss this band, and having this book helped rekindle my love for them.

A group of middle schoolers works on a Super 8 film in the early 80s but then witnesses a train accident and finds out about an alien as well.  There is some drama regarding the death of one young boy's mother at a factory and a girl whose dad worked in the same place; I will not ruin it here by telling you.  But it gives the movie a lot of heart; it is not just another invader from another planet movie.

B0002DKCMG|4.0|For those of you that haven't heard of this film, it's about a few graduating high schoolers that decide to take a tour of Europe post graduation.  You get the idea, young kids let loose in Europe with all the sterotypical stuff you'd expect with one exception.  This movie is done well.  Like any decent movie, acting has to be top notch to get all the subtlties and these actors deliver.  The combination of the great acting and well done story line make this little film a bit of a gem.<br /><br />If you enjoy comedies or have a decent sense of humor, this is one of those movies that, after viewing, you'll say to yourself \\"that was pretty good. I'd like to see it again\\".  There are many, many comedies made in Hollywood and they usually fall into one of three categories: A. Must see B. Worth watching C. Doesn't deliver.  In my mind, this is up there with Slap Shot, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Shorty.  It's fun, clever and you should have a nice time.

B004WFZFIG|5.0|Only people that have the ability to take a macro look at human evolution can appreciate the thrust of the author's argument. Humankind is far better off now than we have ever been on a number of metrics: life expectancy, fecundity, leisure, and GDP, just to name a few off the top of my head. There have been fits and starts, the road has been rocky, and the flame of human progress has nearly been snuffed out innumerable times. The author is not talking about current events (a previous review mentioned \\"Tea Party Science\\" -- the trajectory we're on is far greater than the highly localized, brief blip that is the Tea Party), and he is not an idealogue.   The author addresses the reasons why societal pessimism might be so pervasive, and why it might actually be detrimental to yearn for a self-sufficient, pastoral past. The author views that human development (a rise in the metrics above) is largely dependent specialization and exchange -- \\"when ideas have sex\\" amongst specialists. The march of human progress is now more inexorable than ever, thanks to our shrinking world and the boundless internet.

1451627289|4.0|11/22/63 is a quest story; the type of mythic tale in which a hero leaves his home and battles through daunting trials as he seeks his goal.  Jake Epping's quest in this story is to travel from current-day Lisbon Falls, Maine, back in time to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963. As in any good quest story, from The Odyssey to The Princess Bride, Jake's journey is also a search for meaning and self-discovery. Does that sound high-falutin'? Don't worry; this is also a page-turning adventure with laughter, tears and thrills.<br /><br />Jake Epping is an English teacher at Lisbon High School, where he makes extra money teaching GED students. Jake ends the school year on a high note, attending a GED awards ceremony and congratulating his favorite GED student, the school's janitor, Harry. Jake was moved to tears by Harry's essay describing the Halloween night in 1958 in upstate Derry, when Harry's father attacked his family with a hammer, killing Harry's mother, sister and two brothers, and leaving Harry crippled for life.<br /><br />After the GED ceremony, Jake unwinds at Al Templeton's diner on Main Street, across from the long-closed Worumbo Woolen Mill. Later on, Jake receives a call from a desperate-sounding Al, who begs Jake to meet him at the diner. Al shows Jake a \\"rabbit hole\\" in the diner's pantry that pops up next to the Worumbo Mill--in1958. Al mysteriously appears years older and is suddenly near death from lung cancer. He won't be able to complete his self-appointed mission to use the time portal to prevent JFK's assassination.<br /><br />Jake agrees to take Al's place and, in nothing flat, he steps into 1958 Lisbon Falls, where everything seems peachy, except for the pollutants pouring from the Worumbo Mill and the creepy wino at the gate who accosts him. So now here is Jake, with five years to kill before Al's zero hour. Jake decides to spend his spare time preventing a couple of other past tragedies; one local and the other Harry's horror story in Derry.<br /><br />Jake's journey moves on the Florida and then to Texas, where he lives for a time in Jodie, a small town not far from Dallas. There, he teaches at the local high school and forms important relationships with teachers, students, other townspeople and, most notably, the new school librarian, Sadie. Life in Jodie is an almost idyllic interlude in Jake's quest. He introduces his students to The Catcher in the Rye and inspires jocks to be in the school play.<br /><br />As November, 1963 draws near, Jake must return his focus to his mission. Jake is willing to sacrifice almost anything to prevent the tragedies in Maine and the catastrophe in Dallas, but he finds that time travel is a strange and complex thing. Weird associations, duplications and \\"harmonics\\" keep popping up and, as he puts it, the past is \\"obdurate,\\" resisting change with a force of its own. Every effort to alter the past creates another thread in the fabric of the future, and some of those threads can become hopelessly tangled, threatening to tear that fabric beyond repair. The responsibility of his quest and the need to keep it secret is a crushing burden to Jake; like being J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye for all of humanity.<br /><br />Despite the fantastical premise of the book, it has some heartfelt and human points to make about interconnectedness; how people and events interweave, with the threads coming together in a pattern that persists in our lives, long after those events and people have passed. That theme plays out for Jake through his experiences in Maine and then in Texas.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that the theme of interconnectedness was very personal to King himself. I'm no expert on his work but, while he's made fictional small towns like Castle Rock, Jerusalem's Lot and Derry famous, I think this is the first of his books to feature a real Maine town as a primary location. Jake's--and Stephen King's--Lisbon Falls is veryreal. Most of the places and institutions King describes actually existed and some still do: the Worumbo Mill, Saint Cyril's, the Kennebec Fruit Company, the Lisbon Enterprise newspaper, the Jolly White Elephant, the Red & White grocery store, the Hi-Hat Drive-In, Baumer's Barber Shop, Dunton's Jewelry and the Holly. And many of the people he places in Lisbon Falls are (or were) real, like Frank Anicetti (Senior and Junior, former and current proprietors of the Kennebec Fruit Company), John Gould (former editor of the Lisbon Enterprise) and many others.<br /><br />King grew up in Durham, Maine, across the Androscoggin River from Lisbon Falls, and went to Lisbon High School. He was a high-school reporter for the Lisbon Enterprise, he worked for a time at the Worumbo Mill and, like Jake, he had a credential to teach English. He probably ate at the Hi-Hat, got his hair cut at Baumer's and bought groceries at the Red & White. (I won't speculate about whether he frequented the Holly, a dive bar and one-time strip club.) I think King broke from tradition in using a real location, Lisbon Falls, so that he could acknowledge the part its places and people played in his life.<br /><br />Even when King moves on to the fictional town of Derry and then to Texas, King's personal connections are evident. When King uses the fictional Derry in this book, he incorporates so many of the places and characters in Derry that have been a part of his past writings that it's like a reminiscence. King's chapters on Jake's time in Jodie, Texas, are a kind of love letter to teachers, which reflects King's own background,  his longtime advocacy for literacy and his support for community. And King's choice to make the JFK assassination the linchpin of the time-travel story is appropriate for a man born in 1947. No matter what your politics are, if you were an American in 1963, the assassination was a cataclysmic event. It was a kind of end innocence and it split our lives into a before and after. For King, 16 years old at the time, it must have hit hard.<br /><br />In 11/22/63, Stephen King has used time travel, a classic device of genre fiction, in service of a larger theme that is both personal and universal. But the fact that he has a serious point doesn't stand in the way of the sheer entertainment value of his story. He paints a vivid picture of this country in 1958-1963, with 10-cent root beer, cream-topped milk delivered in bottles, yogurt as a new and exotic food, everyone wearing hats, The Blob playing at the drive-in, cruising in a Ford Sunliner and being able to leave it unlocked. But he doesn't overlook the negatives: overt racism, general acceptance of spousal abuse, people smoking everywhere and polluted air and water.<br /><br />King's storytelling is absorbing and characters compelling. Some, like Jake and Sadie, you'll miss when the story is over, and others you'll be glad you'll never meet in real life. This is a riveting and fully-dimensional story. I could have wished for a little more detailed and lucid d&eacute;nouement, and some editing of the Dallas chapters, but those minor flaws didn't mar and overall terrific read that I'll be thinking about for quite some time.ted and some still do: the Worumbo Mill, Saint Cyril's, the Kennebec Fruit Company, the Lisbon Enterprise newspaper, the Jolly White Elephant, the Red & White grocery store, the Hi-Hat Drive-In, Baumer's Barber Shop, Dunton's Jewelry and the Holly. And many of the people he places in Lisbon Falls are (or were) real, like Frank Anicetti (Senior and Junior, former and current proprietors of the Kennebec Fruit Company), John Gould (former editor of the Lisbon Enterprise) and many others.  King grew up in Durham, Maine, across the Androscoggin River from Lisbon Falls, and went to Lisbon High School. He was a high-school reporter for the Lisbon Enterprise, he worked for a time at the Worumbo Mill and, like Jake, he had a credential to teach English. He probably ate at the Hi-Hat, got his hair cut at Baumer's and bought groceries at the Red & White. (I won't speculate about whether he frequented the Holly, a dive bar and one-time strip club.) I think King broke from tradition in using a real location, Lisbon Falls, so that he could acknowledge the part its places and people played in his life.  Even when King moves on to the fictional town of Derry and then to Texas, King's personal connections are evident. When King uses the fictional Derry in this book, he incorporates so many of the places and characters in Derry that have been a part of his past writings that it's like a reminiscence. King's chapters on Jake's time in Jodie, Texas, are a kind of love letter to teachers, which reflects King's own background,  his longtime advocacy for literacy and his support for community. And King's choice to make the JFK assassination the linchpin of the time-travel story is appropriate for a man born in 1947. No matter what your politics are, if you were an American in 1963, the assassination was a cataclysmic event. It was a kind of end innocence and it split our lives into a before and after. For King, 16 years old at the time, it must have hit hard.  In 11/22/63, Stephen King has used time travel, a classic device of genre fiction, in service of a larger theme that is both personal and universal. But the fact that he has a serious point doesn't stand in the way of the sheer entertainment value of his story. He paints a vivid picture of this country in 1958-1963, with 10-cent root beer, cream-topped milk delivered in bottles, yogurt as a new and exotic food, everyone wearing hats, The Blob playing at the drive-in, cruising in a Ford Sunliner and being able to leave it unlocked. But he doesn't overlook the negatives: overt racism, general acceptance of spousal abuse, people smoking everywhere and polluted air and water.  King's storytelling is absorbing and characters compelling. Some, like Jake and Sadie, you'll miss when the story is over, and others you'll be glad you'll never meet in real life. This is a riveting and fully-dimensional story. I could have wished for a little more detailed and lucid dénouement, and some editing of the Dallas chapters, but those minor flaws didn't mar and overall terrific read that I'll be thinking about for quite some time.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|I got this mouse for free as part of a case-mouse combo deal from Cooler Master, and I thought \\"Hey, this thing looks cooler than the Logitech MX518, might as well give it a shot\\". Much as I love my MX518 (which is still in use on an older build), this mouse does feel more comfortable. It also features the same on the fly sensitivity adjustment, which is great whether you're gaming or doing CAD work, and the higher DPI certainly doesn't hurt. That being said, one feature that I loved in the MX518 was the built in Flip3D button, which is great for sorting through countless windows while doing CAD or coding. This feature can be emulated in the Storm Inferno 4000 by creating a macro (which, for the record, is Ctrl+Win+Tab, not Win+Tab). Doing this means going through Cooler Master's software, which is unfortunately much clunkier and harder to work with than Logitech's. On the bright side, the software will save any written macros and commands into the mouse's firmware, which means one does not have to go through all the work again when switching to a different machine.  Also, this mouse was advertised as being geared towards RPG gaming. I haven't had a chance to use it much in this regard yet, but I can certainly imagine situations where the mouse's added functionality would come in handy.  In short, if you're willing to push past the clunky software and take the time to customize, then this mouse is a great choice. But if you're looking for quick, out-of-the-box functionality, then I recommend the Logitech MX518/G400.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I ordered this movie thinking my wife might enjoy it but was surprised and pleased that we both found it to be a touching and inspiring yet disturbing movie. This is an extremely competent portrayal, by Claire Danes, of a very real young woman named Temple Grandin who is afflicted with autism. There is a short but interesting special features section in which Temple Grandin voices her approval of Claire Danes portrayal of her life.<br /><br />I had heard of autism frequently but had never really taken the time to find out what effect autism had on those who must live with it. This movie does a remarkable job of explaining autism and revealing its impact on the lives of those who must live with it as well as the effects on their friends and families.<br /><br />The overall impression of this movie is a story of courage and determination overcoming obstacles. This message is important and timely and has broad application to many areas of struggle against the odds.<br /><br />This is a movie which can benefit the entire family; there are some very intense moments which may not be suitable for the very young but even these moments are a reflection of the realities of life.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding with all of the major supporting roles turning in powerful performances. Between cast and crew there were 13 Emmy Awards won and 2 Golden Globe Awards plus many, many other awards as well.<br /><br />This one is worthy, uplifting, and left us feeling very glad we watched it! Temple Grandin has a website which I found to be of interest and encourage you to check it out.
0782002064|5.0|OK, it goes without saying this is a great film - the question here is what about this 1993 VHS release? I've seen so many great films with horrible DVD or VHS releases...Set you mind at ease here. This version is so fantastic for a VHS I nearly fainted with joy. Wonderful grey scale and a clean, sharp print. I highly recommend this version of one the best films of all time especially at the holidays! Enjoy!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|This interesting film tells about the fears and suspicions that overwhelm villagers who are frightened by a wolf that kills the village people unless the villagers give it a pig once a month. But then, for no reason that the villagers can fathom, the wolf changes the pattern it had followed for twenty years and, although it was given a pig, it attacks the village and kills Valerie's sister. Valerie lives in the village with her father and mother and her now dead sister. Her mother tells her that her sister is actually her half sister, for she had an affair with another villager. Valerie is in love with Peter, but her mother wants her to marry Henry, the son of her former lover, because Henry is rich. Some of the villagers decide to go after the wolf. Other villagers insist that they should wait for Father Solomon, but the others go after the wolf, to kill it. Later, Father Solomon, who is more a warrior than a priest, comes to the village with soldiers and tells the villagers that their problem is not a regular wolf, but a werewolf who becomes a giant wolf at night and returns to human form during the day. He also says that the werewolf is one of the citizens of the village. But who is the werewolf? The villagers begin to suspect one another. Why did the wolf change its habits? How many people will it kill? What will happen to the people who pursue the wolf? What will happen to Valerie, to Peter, to Henry, to Valerie's mother, to Father Solomon, and the wolf? What significance do the villagers see in the red cloak that Valarie's grandmother gave to her?
030726999X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is wanted for murder and has been shot in the head.  Her surgeon, Dr. Jonasson, just wants to save her brain and her life, regardless of what crimes she may have committed.  Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, her sometimes friend, sometimes lover, sometimes neither, just wants to expose the corrupt system that has victimized Lisbeth since she was a child.  There are more Swedish characters here than I could possibly keep up with, and that wouldn't be such a problem, except that I occasionally got confused as to who was a good guy and who was a bad guy--or gal, as the case may be.  The primary bad guys are Lisbeth's brother Niedermann (whose name I word-associated to Neanderthal), who cannot feel physical pain, and the ultra-sleezy psychologist Teleborian.  The plot, along with various subplots, conspiracies, and intrigues, builds to a crescendo with Lisbeth's trial, in which the whole hornet's nest is exposed to all parties, right up to the prime minister.  This may not be a literary thriller, but it is certainly a gripping one, and a beautifully fluid translated one; there are none of the awkward phrases that so often annoy me in a translation.  Realism may not reign supreme here, but at least the two main characters are heroic without being flawless.  Lisbeth is amazingly resourceful but manages to antagonize even her supporters at times with her refusal to divulge even the most benign secrets.  Mikael's relentless endeavor to clear Lisbeth's reputation and record is sullied slightly by his philandering ways.  This book seems to have more female heroines than the previous two, including Mikael's latest paramour, the statuesque Inspector Monica Figuerola, plus Lisbeth's lawyer (and Mikael's sister) Annika Giannini, and Milton Security's Susanne Linder, whose client is the eternally gutsy Erika Berger.  Thank heavens it doesn't end in a cliffhanger.

0316044695|5.0|To read what the SEAL's go through in their training and try to grasp what Hell Week is all about was inspiring enough. This and background of the author basically make up first half of the book. Then in the second half which deatils the mission and its consequences you understand why the Navy trains these guys like they do. This book is the most inspiring story I have ever read. The men who turn up for SEAL basic training BUD/S are the elite. Yet the failure rate is 75%, the mental and physical courage of these guys is hard to comprehend, then when they graduate they willingly put themselves at the pointy end of operations in which every time they go on a mission they may die. These days when ever I get a bit tired from my efforts exercising, etc I merely have to think of the SEAL's to push me further, daily inspiration in an easy to read no nonsense style.

B001HN6922|3.0|There exists an ingrained understanding of violence in every human being from conception, and this understanding is furthered along by the media in many instances - none better than through children's multimedia. Kids are faced with having to reconcile the idea that it is okay for the 'bad guy' to try to kill the 'good guy' - that's just what bad guys do.   A parent needs to realize that good/bad at such an early age in children's development needs to be clearly outlined but seriously folks, let's not go overboard. Violence has been around long before the first television was brought into a living room. The stories from the brothers Grimm were extremely popular yet they were considered and cruel. As it has been noted already, this Pixar movie definitely deviates from the norm as it parodies the spy genre, in particular the James Bond series. In doing so, certain aspects of the Bond movies such as torture and mayhem are bound to appear in the spoof. If this idea is unacceptable, then please skip this film.   My real criticism with this movie isn't so much regarding the violent action sequences but the storyline. Lightning McQueen's best friend Tow Mater is featured more prominently than the first film. Personally, Mater's character reminds me of that lost uncle you see once a year at Thanksgiving - the one with strictly r-rated vocabulary, poor hygiene and an unidentifiable odor to match. They can both be entertaining in perfectly smaller doses.   The visuals are everything we have come to expect from Pixar and Michael Caine shines as an undercover agent. Everyone deserves respect but the message of being true to who you really are, even if you are a moron, gets lost in the end. For a studio that delivered a great sequel (Toy Story 2) when I thought the original couldn't be topped, I want to give Pixar credit by thinking they succumbed to the pressure of producing Cars 2 on a strict timeline. It's highly enjoyable as a parody film but not an original movie I could watch more than once like the first installment.   Bottom line: I would warn against having kids younger than 5 view it; good movie in the grand scheme of children's movies; not Pixar re-defining good however.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I purchased this cover in red for my Kindle Fire.  I was a bit worried about the unit fitting after I read some of the reviews.  I had no trouble at all placing my Kindle in the cover.  The elastic straps have a rubber backing and they fit snuggly for extra security.  I like the fact that there is one for every corner.  My other Kindle cover only had one long strap and I was constantly worried that my reader would fall out. Some reviewers commented that the cover wouldn't close all the way.  My cover was the same way when I first got it. After I placed my Kindle face down on the table for a few hours, the cover conformed to the unit and now closes completely.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the look and feel of this cover!  It really looks like an antique leather book.  The one little criticism I have is that the spine is brown instead of red like the rest of the cover.  I might have chosen the tan cover if I had known this fact before purchasing, but it doesn't take away from the overall look of the piece. I am EXTREMELY pleased with this cover and would recommend it to others without hesitation.
098357670X|5.0|I have owned several books on how to do Caricatures, some I have bought through Amazon.com.  Most of them were worth the money and a few should never have been printed.  Most of them use someone elses work to make their points, but Tom Richmond does all the work in this one and I found it less confusing because of this consistancy. Every point he makes he demonstrates himself.  Mr Richmond is known best for his Caricature work in MAD magazine, but you can recognize his work in other illustrations all over the place.  Most recently for Jeff Dunham (I love that guys work too).  Point is Tom is a Professional Caricaturist and absolutely one of the best.  He is a heck of a teacher also.  I personally started looking at peoples faces a whole lot differently from the start. The book doesn't just cover faces though, it also covers hands, body gestures, and other items that make your caricature recognizable.  For all the work that went into this book you will get alot more than your moneys worth from it.  My caricatures are starting to look more like exagerations than mini portraits and I'm loving that. A big thank you to Mr Richmond for sharing his secrets.
0439023521|5.0|This book it one of the best books I have read in the past few years. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a few days. The premises of the book may seem brutal, but the growth that the main characters go through is so rewarding. I recommend this book for young readers as well as old. I think it bridges the age gap (similar to Harry Potter). Can't wait for the movie to come out and I'm anxiously waiting for the 2nd and 3rd books to arrive on my doorstep.

B00004YX39|5.0|This is the best of the Steely Dan albums in my opinion. I like it better than Aja but that one is also a five star album. Gaucho just has some of my favorite all time songs on it: \\"Time out of Mind,\\" \\"Glamor Profession,\\" \\"Gaucho,\\" and \\"Third World Man.\\"   The list of musicians on this is the Jazz Rock Hall of Fame. The Brecker Brothers, Chuck Rainey, Joe Sample, Hiram Bullock, Larry Carlton, Rick Derringer, Steve Khan, Larry Carlton, Mark Knofler, David Sanborn, Steve Gadd, Rick Morotta, Bernard Purdie, Victor Feldman and Michael McDonald. Talk about name droppers. Every song is a jazz rock classic. 5 big stars.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|This is far and away her most challenging work (Re:\\"her audience\\") since The Dreaming, and easily her best work since \\"Hounds Of Love\\". The recording is simply mind-blowing and i am sure you will not hear a better sounding record all year. Kate Bush is quietly getting on with leaving a body of work people will discuss and judge 500 yrs from now, so snap judgement's made in the cold light of today seem daft to be honest. This like all her best work is a recording that will really stand the test of time, as has the music by all the great composers & artists she admires so. A clear understanding of sonic vibration & how it affects us is clearly stamped all over this, and if you are spiritually tuned to receive this extra gift then your heart and soul will soar just like i'm sure she planned it too. I'm not a huge fan of the Elton John duet i'm afraid to say, his voice seems to break the spell somewhat, although like many masterpieces i can forgive it this one small flaw. Make no mistake this is a masterpiece, and to produce it 33 years into a career in the same year that all her female contemporaries released albums also makes it a trump card. Congratulations & thank you to Kate Bush, a \\"Master Of Art\\". xxxxx
0321704452|4.0|In The Naked Presenter: Delivering Powerful Presentations With or Without Slides the author, Garr Reynolds, encourages the reader to throw off pretense and formality in order to more effectively connect with an audience.  He explains the need to know your audience so well that you are able to communicate in a way that impacts both their reason and their emotions.  In other words, you should target the whole person.  Reynolds goes on to show how to take these concepts and build presentations which can bring about change in your audience.    I found the overall emphasis on naturalness to be compelling and I felt that his admonition to focus on the needs of the audience from both a mental and an emotional perspective was spot on.      The section which explained the simplified process for developing a presentation was particularly beneficial to me.  In addition, I found that the mechanisms that he recommended for gathering and organizing your thoughts were very helpful.  Reynolds does an effective job of breaking down the process of delivering a presentation.     In his closing thoughts he encourages the reader to be persistent and to recognize that through effort and self education anyone can become a great communicator.

0385344325|3.0|Did anyone else start counting how many times Child wrote \\"He made a face\\"?  I lost track at 20.  Sometimes, for variety, it was \\"She made a face.\\" Honestly, what does that even mean?    I don't want to talk about the plot's implausbility - all Reacher novels are highly implausible. We buy into them, however, because the writing is taut and suspenseful, the characters interesting, and SOME aspects of the setting and action are believable. This just did not happen here.  Example: I'll go along with the hero hitchhiking into town and finding that the police chief is a stunning brunette who is serious about her job but falls for the hero almost immediately (and goes to bed with him) even though she figures out exactly what he's up to in the first five minutes. But, don't try to tell me that she is slender as all get out yet eats nothing but farmhand breakfasts, cheeseburgers and pie EVERY DAY FOR MONTHS.  Please, she never ever EVER eats a green vegetable and still looks like a supermodel? I don't care how great her metabolism is -- I just don't think so.  And Reacher does have a brain, and a vocabulary (he reads, according to some of the other books) - would he really describe her breasts as \\"fantastic\\" ? And what the heck are \\"fantastic\\" breasts anyway -- all I could think was, do they glow in the dark? Leap tall buildings in a single bound?   I do think the author deserves credit for jumping around and not just marching forward into Reacher's middle age. This book did make some sense in terms of explaining Reacher's departure from the military police. But otherwise, it was kinda lame.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This is a fine film, about a group of women in a dynamic time when many certainties and ways of doing things are coming into question.  The setting is Mississippi, perhaps the most violent Jim Crow state in the Union, composed of many, many layers.  There are the affluent whites, most of whom have no empathy for those not in their narrow world, and \\"the help\\", the black women who do most of the chores around the house and are participants but not part of the family.<br /><br />Enter into the mix a feisty young college grad, who has vivid memories of her nanny, played by the amazing Cicely Tyson, and who is accepted by the \\"good\\" whites but never quite fit in.  There is a mystery to her disappearance from the family and the young lady, who wants to write for a living, can't get answers from her rigid mother.  She finally get a job at the local paper in the journalistic underclass that writes for a name-brand columnist on rather mundane household issues.  But what she really wants to do is a book on the domestics, who she goes about cultivating.  The nannies are afraid to talk for the record, realistically fearing that they may be lynched or ostracized.  Of course, with the push of an aggressive editor (a wonderfully realistic and manipulative character played by Steenbowgen), she gets their stories as events unfold.  The stories are wonderful.<br /><br />A subplot is a fight she has with one of her old friends, who displays the kind of racism that is in the bones of many southerners - not overt, and fully justified in her mind (\\"they are different\\", \\"separate but equal\\"), and ultimately cruelly lacking in empathy or understanding.  The writer plays her along, never confronting her, yet working to expose her hypocrisy and narcissism and in the end, almost blackmailing her into silence.<br /><br />Interestingly, the good guys in this are not the best looking.  This is a very fun reversal.  The film also strives to be realistic, without a hint of over-played comedy yet many funny and ironic moments that are very real.  The only relatively weak performance, unfortunately, was the writer; some of her acting did not always ring true to me.<br /><br />The film moved me for many reasons.  I too had a nanny, as my mother was one of the first career women of her generation, and I benefitted greatly from her intelligence and support while growing up.  I loved her, yet also feel I never did enough to thank her.  This brought tears to my eyes.  I also had relatives in the south, some of whom I still consider close family.  Their attitudes to race shocked me, though some of them struggled with it.  The film helped me to reflect on this yet again.nts that are very real.

0439023513|3.0|I adored the first two books in this trilogy, but \\"Mockingjay\\" was kind of a let-down. I don't want to give anything away, but the first part of the book really dragged for me, and then the momentum finally picked up again, and then OH MY GOD, WHY DID THE AUTHOR DECIDE TO RUIN THIS SERIES?!<br /><br />Seriously, I was definitely taken by surprise by the twists and turns at the end of this book, and not in a good way. I understand that these are books about war and the many grisly consequences that result from it, but seriously, did so many people need to die, and does the ending have to be so grim? I am not satisfied with the way the Katniss/Gale/Peeta love triangle was resolved, and although some people probably think the ending is optimistic, I disagree. In fact, I think it sucks. The only reason I gave this book three stars is because I tend to be an overly generous reviewer, especially when critiquing the work of someone who has done such a great job in the past. Prepare to be disappointed with this one.

B005MP28B2|5.0|There is something so wonderful in this movie, it's hard to put into words. More than the story line which is a classic and far-reaching scenario that has affected each one of us no matter how old we are at present ~ but this is even much, much more.  What we have is the birth, constant change, and creation cycle along with a quiet, picturesque 1950's flavor literal ballet of life, death, and rebirth.  Captured is the struggle of Masculine/ Feminine values in conflict from the beginning a new family. The man overburdened with the heavy responsibilities and fleeting joy of raising a family and bringing in enough money to sustain it. How quickly his views become jaded with the dog-eat-dog world of 3D. This takes place every day and is a key element in our daily struggle.<br /><br />The pressures put upon the father in this sustaining role, preclude and bias him, so that he is unable to enjoy and actually relate to those he is sustaining. There is great symbolism between Father, Mother, and Son just as there is in most of our relationships with God, the Father. Our views on God have everything to do with our own relationship with our own Earthly father. And a son who can never please him. Most of us know this struggle up close and personal. On the other hand, the wife and feminine influence, has no real respect or power but sustains the family in a different set of values. Those of beauty, compassion, art, kindness, nurturing yet she lacks power to change her own world or so it would appear due to unreal expectations put upon her.<br /><br />So in counterpoint against each other is the Father/God (Masculine) and Mother/Earth (Feminine) elements we each share.<br /><br />Add the loss of a son, grief, and through the dark vortex of grief, anger, and regret is born a whole new vista.  We have the \\"creation\\" of this new world fueled by anger with the symbolism of the CREATION. Dark void (death) and the bubbling up and restoration of this new world as it moves like our original birth through all the stages from ameoba, tadpole through every stage of development in the womb into human form and into the light of a new day and dawn.

0321704452|5.0|Earlier this year I was one of the many people that made subpar presentations. I'm sure that my presentations contained a lot of very detailed and important information, but I believe that it wasn't really received by my audiences because I wasn't focused on them. I was like an actor on the stage reciting my lines and trying to look natural (although I'm sure that I didn't).  This summer I took a public speaking class in which I was required to read this book. I wasn't thrilled about the book at first, but I certainly grew to like it within the first few chapters. The principles that Garr Reynolds covers in The Naked Presenter helped me to relax, be myself, and focus on providing value to the audience by engaging them. I recently had an opportunity to apply what I had learned, and after the presentation I was repaid with extremely positive feedback from several audience members and managers.
0805091742|4.0|I have to admit that I read this book for a class that I took and at first I wasn't exactly thrilled to read about checklists. But soon after I opened the book, I realized that I couldn't put it down. I was really drawn to the stories regarding medical care and how checklists were used to improve the quality of care that many of us take for granted. This book helped me to see how something as simple as a checklist can have a big impact on seemingly complex activities.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This collection of all Harry Potter films is perfect for the viewer who doesn't need the extra/bonus features.  It is all 8 films in one case.  No misplacing any of the movies.  I oringally got it because I hadn't seem the \\"Deathly Hollows 1 & 2\\".  I was also missing three of the movies from our collections.  It was very reasonable priced at $48.00.  I love it.
B005KMX866|4.0|Chris Isaak has said that the Elvis Presley \\"Sun Records\\" recordings are the Rosetta Stone of Rock and Roll. His understanding, love of the primative essential sound of the backroom tapes at 706 Union Ave. , Memphis TN, is soul deep.   Chris deciphers the raw and the rare and places his interpretations square (baby I don't care) in the forefront of modern day roustabout rebels.   Chris may not have the deep tremelo of EL P or the high vibratro of Roy O, but he hits more than he misses in the mid range of nicely done fun.   We suggest the full 2CD with the bonus recordings and the grins that accompany it. (My Happiness !)
B005KLN074|5.0|This is the FULL DVD import. All 21 songs from start to finish and a couple of bonus things. Over all worth it if you are a huge fan. :)
B00479SVBU|4.0|I have tried quite a few transmitters and I can assure that this one steals the show.  The convenience is that you could use a Aux in or use a thumb drive or even a memory card. It even remembers the last song you played and continues from there. It has got a built in fuse to ensure that the car's fuse is not tripped when there is a short.  I would definitely recommend this to all.  Reason I haven't given 5 stars ? - Well, I think $40 was a lil too much for the same. around $30 would be a better price.

0385535139|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I doubt this novel will go down as the favorite Grisham of very many people, although that's not to say that it's not a good read.  It is.  Glad I read it.  I recommend it.  But it also didn't have me sitting on the edge of my chair.<br /><br />I think what made me not like the book more -- although 4 stars is pretty decent -- is that many of the characters are not that likable.  The sleazy law partners of Finley & Figg -- not much to like there.  What they are is essentially ambulance chasers.  But okay, who said the law was pretty?  Then there's the main character -- David Zinc -- a young attorney who has worked himself into a virtual nervous breakdown at tone of the big corporate law firms...who spends a day drinking himself into a stupor and walks into Finley & Figg and gives himself a job.  Not very admirable, although he does redeem himself later in the book.  Maybe that's a slight problem with this novel...there's no one to really root for.<br /><br />So, no, it's not the main characters I enjoyed in this book.  So what was it that kept me reading?  The sense that even in the low-life parts of the law profession there are self-limiting forces in the legal system (and in court rooms) that prevent too much...well, in politics nowadays we call it overreaching.<br /><br />Who comes off worst here?  Not the sleazy lawyers, but rather a big drug company who ultimately has a safe product, but whose testing procedures are exposed (toward the end of the novel).  Clearly, Grisham is not a fan of the big drug companies.<br /><br />I'd disagree with the blurb that calls this a \\"tremendously entertaining romp\\", but you'll enjoy it.  And while I can't recommend it as strongly as I would other Grisham novels, it's better than most of what's out there.  So I give it a very strong B+ or even and A-.
B004OT8HJO|5.0|I just got this set for myself and love it. I'm 25 but an avid star wars Lego collector. I was on the fence about buying the set for some time due to the price, but would definitely say that it's worth it. The build took me almost 4 hours, but I wasn't trying to rush. I'm impressed with how durable and well-constructed it is. For a set of its size, it is incredibly tough. Whoever designed the set definitely put durability as a high priority. The detail is also impressive, including the game board, cannons, computers, beds, etc.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this set for builders of all ages; for collectors like me it's a great set to have in your collection, and for younger builders it's a ton of fun to build and to play with.
B000059MEK|5.0|Mind-blowing as it may be, Daft Punk's Discovery is now celebrating ten years of providing eager listeners with perfect blend of soothing sounds and engaging pop-music themes, all the while setting a ridiculously high standard for mainstream electronica in the last decade.  The album marks a transition of the artists from the more hardcore sounds of Homework, their first studio album, to an electronic sound with less of their trademark hard-hitting techno, relying instead on samples, intricate melodies constructed with layers upon layers of synth textures, and a diligent focus on composition.  In Homework, many of the songs relied on intense repetition, however in Discovery, Daft Punk has been able to achieve an electronic musical experience removed from the pumping bass and subdued, simple melodic motifs.    Instead, the sounds of the French duo's second studio album are reminiscent of a musical era long past, as many of their synthesizers use timbres that one might associate with a disco club set in the 70's or 80's.  Even the beats they compose have a distinctly disco-pop flavor, much different from the coursing, bass-heavy beats commonly associated with their house music heritage.  The rhythms in Discovery take a back seat to the more important themes written out in the complex synthesizer sounds.  This album will definitely want to make you dance, but in an energetic, dynamic, and playful manner that sets it apart from thumping electronica.  Many melodic elements in the pieces on the album remind the listener of computer music found during the introduction to a VHS tape or 70's television show.  Much like the simple songs made with Max Mathews' Music 1, these elements are basic and when taken alone have very little artistic impact.  However, Daft Punk layers these elements carefully together to create complex musical flow, as in the song \\"Veridis Quo\\".  Of course, the final compositions are not as simple as the compositions from Music 1 because of the availability of engineered synthesizers.    The range of synthesizer sounds on this album is astounding.  Nowadays, artists stick with a trademark synthesizer timbre that often pervades their entire album, appearing on all or almost all of their tracks.  The opposite can be said about this album, as on most tracks, a complexity of synthesizer sounds can be heard.  One good example of this is the track \\"Nightvision\\", where a number of synth textures are clearly present.  The combination of synthesizer sounds and sequential composition is reminiscent of the Buchla synthesizer.  Undoubtedly, Daft Punk did not use the Buchla to compose these songs, but they definitely used sequencers in tandem with their synthesizer modules to arrange the music.  As well as using synthesizers, electroacoustic instruments are also used in this album.  In the songs \\"Something About Us\\", and \\"Voyager\\", de Homem-Christo (one half of Daft Punk) is clearly heard strumming an electric guitar to create a layer of the melody.  In \\"Aerodynamic\\", one may think the predominant sound is an electric guitar, however it is a synth that has been cleverly resampled.  In addition to electroacoustic instrumentation, vocoders are used to bridge the gap between vocals and synthesizer sounds, and can be heard in \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Digital Love\\".  Sampling is another method used in this album.  Tracks such as \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\", \\"Crescendolls\\", and \\"Superheroes\\" sample either instrumentals or vocals from artists such as Barry Manilow, George Duke, and Edwin Birdsong, contributing yet again to the disco-pop feel of the album.  Like Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry's musique concrete, these samples are manipulated to make a musical composition.  However, since there is a lack of exclusivity in the use of samples, this electronic music is more reminiscent of Karlheinz Stockhausen's compromise of combining elektronische musik, or electronic music made purely of synthesized tones and notes, with musiqueconcrete, or sample-based music.  An interesting aspect of Daft Punk is that sometimes instead of using the sample directly, they will create a unique rendition and use this new sample instead of the original.  This album to me will always represent the timeless aspect of Daft Punk's music.  I say this because each time I listen to the album, each piece seems fresh, just recently composed, and simply suspended in a vacuum, able to be listened to in any era, at any time, in any place and make the listener feel comfortable and elated.  Perhaps it is how their music speaks to the playfulness of human nature or to the inner child or how each was meticulously produced to allow Daft Punk's genius creativity to shine through.  Whatever the reason, any time is a great time to listen to the album.  In addition to the album itself, Daft Punk teamed up with Toei Animation in Japan to produce a feature film with audio exclusively from the Discovery tracks in sequential order.  The film, titled Interstella 5555, imparts further significance on the themes in the tracks and is a must watch for fans of the album.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|This item was not what I expected at all. Cheaply made and just poor quality. Was told I have a $10 credit for my next purchase, don't know where that is either.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I purchased this movie after hearing allot about it. I have to say that it was a very exciting/suspenseful/depressing movie. I say depressing because you can really get caught up in the lives of some of the characters and get sucked into their lives. The movie is very well made and the actors put on a great performance.

B002KRFND0|5.0|I wanted to add to our family library/top 40 classic books of all time a detective/mystery book. There were a few excellent choices but I selected Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and bought the Barnes and Noble 2009 edition of The Complete Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle was an Scottish eye doctor who lived 1859-1930 and was a master story teller and INMO the creator of the best ever detective/mystery character Sherlock Holmes and sidekick/assistant Dr. Watson. Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle also wrote the epic \\"Lost World\\" and the Professor Challenger series  ,and some horror and vampire stories and more. One of my favorite authors. What an imagination!<br /><br />All Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories are excellent and we are told he really didn't want to write unless he put out superb quality in his characters and plots. Originally he only wanted to write at the most 3 stories about Sherlock Holmes and kill him off and write other novels but his works were greatly accepted and his publishers wanted MORE and MORE and were willing to pay Doyle more and more.<br /><br />His complete group of Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories collectively  has been the second greatest read collection world wide of all time. Over 100 countries and many many languages these have been published in. Millions and millions published. Only the Bible has been read more!<br /><br />This 2009 edition by Barnes and Noble is leather bound  and has a  beautiful engraved front and back cover, faux gold edge paper and a gold colored place holder ribbon. Excellent quality. Its 1077 pages of great reading.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, relax and slowly enjoy it. I used the stories as a mental exercise to see if I could solve the cases by the clues Doyle gives though Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. After a while you learn a little of how Sherlock's mind works in seeing the smallest clues that others find unimportant. After a few of the stories I was able to solve about 20% of the cases using the clues before  2/3s of the story was finished. Of course keep on reading the story. Just sheer enjoyment.<br /><br />My favorite was The Hound of the Baskervilles but ALL of the novels and short stories were 5 star.<br /><br />I liked that Sherlock Holmes never tried to make a big name of himself but gave Scotland Yard and other police agencies credit for the crimes he solved. Sherlock even declines knighthood and took many cases from poor people just because the case was interesting to him. Also Holmes solves some delicate international cases involving heads of state. All kinds of cases; some small and some huge in scope. Some cases he  pockets huge multi thousand pound fees from some very rich and powerful people.  Throughout most of  Holmes 20 plus years as a private investigator , his friend Dr. Watson stays true as his best friend and helper. When Holmes was not on a case and using his fantastic brain power of deduction and reasoning he got very bored and injected himself numerous times with a 7% cocaine based serum. He was a part time drug addict for a while. Holmes battles the evil super smart, ultra villain Professor Moriarty. Later in life Holmes retires in the country in England as a bee keeper but still solves a few crimes.<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle INMO created one of the most comprehensive, detailed characters in Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The reader can really empathise with both these characters.<br /><br />There is A Study in Scarlet part 1 and 2, The Sign Of The Four, 12 stories in The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, 11 stories in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, 13 stories in The Return of Sherlock Holmes, my favorite The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear Part 1 and 2, 8 stories in His Last Bow and 12 stories In The Case of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Try solving the cases with the clues given...its a lot of fun and tickles the gray matter.<br /><br />This book proudly goes in our familylibrary as the top detective/mystery book of all time and in the top 40 classics.  Highest rating 5 stars plus. I liked this book so much, I plan to buy the Lost World and the Professor Challenger series and Doyle's Vampire and Supernatural collection.us.

0785132619|5.0|We have all fantasized about different lives, different realities. For some the fantasy can be as simple as winning the lottery and for others as far-fetching as having superhuman abilities. Kick-Ass is a comic book that indulges in fantasizing while keeping things grounded in the 'real world'.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is a 16 year-old high school student. There is nothing extraordinary about him. He is a normal kid that blends in the crowd and gets ignored by girls. Although he is also a hardcore fanboy, one of those guys that buys comic books on a weekly basis and spends way too many hours on comic book message boards. The first pages provide us with an accurate image of Dave's introvert personality, how he isolated himself after his mother died, how despite having a couple of friends he's unable to relate to people on a larger scale. Ultimately, like any other teen, Dave has fun and gives into masturbatory practices, frequently fantasizing about his biology teacher or the girl sitting next to him.<br /><br />Up until this point this is a cohesive and solid narration about a teenager that dreams of being a superhero. But it is Millar's cleverness and acute analysis of the superhero genre which puts this on a whole new level. I'd say that in order to understand Millar's Kick-Ass we must first remember two crucial works distanced only by a few centuries: [[ASIN:0060934344 Don Quixote]] and [[ASIN:1401219268 Watchmen]].<br /><br />In Cervantes' Don Quixote we have an impoverished hidalgo that is so obsessed with books of chivalry that he thinks he can be one of those mythical knights in shining armor and fight against the evils of the world. It doesn't matter that most of the events in these books are completely outside the realm of possibility, Don Quixote doesn't believe in the impossibility of his quest. Much in the same vein, Dave Lizewski has a rather profound interest in comic books, and he doesn't understand why nobody has tried to be a superhero before. Is ordinary life really so exciting?, he asks himself. His friends, geeks like him try to dissuade him. For them everything is clear: the life of a superhero can only exist within the pages of a comic book.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is rightfully considered the most influential title in decades for one reason: the deconstruction of the superhero genre. Not unlike Cervantes book, Moore's work also focuses on the most typical elements that define the superhero genre and he finds the structural fissures in the world of masked vigilantes and avenging heroes only to exploit those fissures thus creating an entire new concept of the man behind the mask. There is, however, one difference between Cervantes and Moore. One of them proved that books of chivalry were childish, ridiculous and therefore inadequate for the early 17th century, while the other proved that most comic books had been too self-indulgent, nonsensical and as result the superhero genre needed to evolve, to mature. The Spaniard author singlehandedly destroyed the tradition of books of chivalry whereas Moore ushered American comic books into a new era of unprecedented creativity and maturity.<br /><br />But that was then and this is now. Many people have criticized Watchmen's aftermath; the `grim and gritty' approach to comics pretty much became mandatory, which was a mistake because without variety the possibilities to be creative were narrowed. Now, I won't dare to say that Kick-Ass is as important now as Watchmen was in the 80s, I've always hated this kind of irritating comparisons which, in the end, benefit no one. But Kick-Ass is a clear attempt to look into the structures of superhero comics and unraveling pre-established paradigms, clich&eacute;s and predictable outcomes, in other words, Millar takes apart the whole machinery and reassembles it in a way that is both fresh and enticing.<br /><br />The first issue shows us how devastatingly dangerous it can be for a costumed kid to go out on the streets dressed up as a masked avenger. Dave almost dies in his first `mission', and after several surgeries and six months in hospital he starts recovering. What Millar does is taking to the extreme the consequences of a fight, in a way that reminds me of Miller's [[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]] (Bruce Wayne's first mission is also a disaster and after being shot he nearly bleeds to death). Thanks to this approach, the protagonist immediately feels real to us, the readers, he's not only likable but also vulnerable.<br /><br />But what other similitudes are shared by Kick-Ass and Watchmen? In a way, they both work as a parody to the superhero genre (just like Don Quixote was a parody to chivalric literature), although in a different manner. Contemporary philosopher Fredric Jameson stated that parody and pastiche were not synonyms. Postmodern world can be defined by pastiche and a historicity crisis. Parody would require a moral judgment or a comparison with societal normativity (here Don Quixote fits in nicely as parody); on the other hand, pastiche is prone to \\"collage and other forms of juxtaposition without a normative grounding\\".<br /><br />America winning the war against Vietnam is a milestone in Watchmen's universe. And it all comes down to Jameson's historicity. As it has been said, a crisis in historicity permeates our postmodern era: \\"there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the American history we learn from schoolbooks and the lived experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city of the newspapers and of our own everyday life\\". This is why everything in Watchmen feels so genuine, insofar as it rejects historicity (what we might have learned or not in textbooks). Kick-Ass, however, disregards the historicity crisis, and as a result it is a parody disguised as pastiche, which perhaps could explain why it caters to highly intellectualized readers as well as to the common audience.<br /><br />Another supporter of the pastiche would be Quentin Tarantino who, coincidentally, has created an aesthetic of violence that shares a few traits with Millar's bloody battles and brutal fights. The filmmaker and the writer are incapable of producing gratuitous violence, they turn it instead into something of purely artistic value, which is by far one of the most difficult feats I could possibly imagine. Violent sequences are cannon in most of Millar's works, and Kick-Ass is no exception. Perhaps the embodiment of this is Hit-Girl, a child that has been deprived of her childhood and forced to train every day of her young life. And at such a tender age she already is a force to be reckoned with. Her mentor is also her father, `Big Daddy', a man that acts like Frank Castle AKA Punisher and has sworn to annihilate the mob. When Kick-Ass is saving a guy from being mugged, or rescuing a cat from a burning building, Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are taking down mobsters in a most brutal and bloodstained fashion.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is a delightfully charming adolescent partly because of his verisimilitude and vulnerability, but mainly because of his goofiness and clumsiness which is contrasted by the efficiency and ruthlessness of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. Dave is only human, and because of that he makes mistakes all the time and even though he can struggle in the streets he's unable to get a date with Katie, the girl he likes. There are some hilarious moments in which Dave pretends to be gay just so he can get closer to the girl he loves. But it's also this need for companionship that prevents him from realizing the true intentions of the Red Mist, another masked youngster.<br /><br />As I've said before, the pastiche relies on collages, which in this case can be seen as constant references of pop culture that the protagonists find either demeaning (famous `super stars') or distinguished (here comic books exemplify grandiosity); such is the case of Whedon's Astonishing X-Men or the first issues of some of the most pivotal Marvel titles (Amazing Fantasy, Fantastic Four, Avengers, Tales of Suspense, Journey into Mystery, etc.).<br /><br />Millar's success has helped him to get into Hollywood with [[ASIN:1582404976 Wanted]] and now with Kick-Ass. I really enjoyed the filmic version, although I was a bit irked to find out that there were some unfortunate changes. Now I really don't give a damn about how they made the suits or if the actors looked like the characters in the comic book, in my opinion those are nimieties. There are however certain points that are strongly conveyed in the comic book and that are either toned down or simply discarded for the big screen version, namely the true sadistic nature of Kick-Ass's nemesis. Indeed, Red Mist admits that the very notion of torturing his opponent has sexually aroused him on many occasions.<br /><br />But perhaps the greatest failure of the movie is the ending. Part of Millar's strength lies in surprising us, and that's what he does in the final pages of the 8th issue of the series: Dave plays his final gambit to win the heart of the girl he loves, but Katie simply repudiates him and humiliates him by sending him a picture of herself practicing a fellatio on a rather `big' Afro-American male. Perhaps in one of the saddest and yet shocking pages I've ever read, Dave can't help but to masturbate while looking at the picture and crying afterwards. Who could come up with a more demoralizing and yet formidable ending? The movie, of course, chooses a typical Hollywood ending... he gets the girl in the last minute. So, once again, I have no choice but to say that the source material is better than the cinematographic adaptation.shares a few traits with Millar's bloody battles and brutal fights.

B0068C9W44|5.0|I bought this album and lucked out on one of those Black Friday Deals.  I usually will not buy a whole album unless I have heard the album in its entirety or I have heard one of two songs and there is a good deal on Amazon.  I bought this because of the latter.  I like all of the songs on the CD, but I am one of those heartless romantics when it comes to these love struck songs, I can't help bt listen, and this album is all about love drunk.  I even think there is song that goes on about the line.  But to the point if you like Rihanna, you will like this album.  However, even though the songs have tempo, you are not going to get any S&M, Hard, or Please Don't Stop the Music, this is album is a little more toned downI think the Deluxe Edition has 3 more songs, and from the samples I like 2 of them, but I am not too fancied over \\"Red Lipstick\\" from the couple second I heard.  In fact, I can probably see many of these songs will probably be played as that song that is played at Homecomings, Proms, Weddings, or one of those bittersweet love moments in a movie.
B005WZZRD8|1.0|thinking that I was buying a pop CD as her previous album... But it sounds more like a gospel hating CD every track you can listen \\"Jesus\\" \\"Mary\\" \\"Judas\\" and many tracks are just the same more and more times (Merry The Night, The Edge Of Glory, Hair, Born This Way)
B003ITZBVS|5.0|For Batman fans, this animated film is a solid buy. This film is for adults however seeing that the story lines from Batman \\"A Death in the Family\\" and \\"Under the Hood\\" are darker subject matter. PG 13 is a great rating and keeping that in mind if allowing younger children under 13 to watch this film.   Voice acting was great in some parts lacking in others. Bruce Greenwood and Jensen Ackles did a great job but for long time Batman fans, it's hard to not hear Kevin Conroy's voice when you see Batman.  The same can be said for the absents of Mark Hamill has the joker.  Replacing iconic voice actors is difficult. However, the solid story and directing allows you to forgive these shortcomings.     The story was solid before it was a movie.  However, the adaptation of the comic and directing made sure the story was interesting and kept you on your toes. Has a fan I knew where the story was going but I was never bored or felt cheated by the films adaptation of the story. For comic book fans, you won't feel cheated!  For people not familiar with the story you will want to know more.     If you don't have this film and you're a Batman fan I hope Batman comes to your house and throws a Batarang at you because it's that good.  Pros  * Story  * Directing  * Animation  * Comic to film adaptation   * Dialogue of characters  Cons  * No Mark Hamill or Kevin Conroy  * Nightwing was a little Campy

B004LWZW4C|4.0|I read the 1-star reviews after purchasing film so I was worried I was going to have problems playing the movie, nonetheless I opened the movie and played it on my PS3 with absolutely zero issues! People having issues on their PS3 probably need to have the latest update installed.   My only complaint is regarding the picture quality, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. There seems to be a \\"blur\\" effect around the actors in certain scenes. In particular scenes with low lighting or somewhat quick movement. I would normally assume this to be a TV issue, however, my other Blu-Rays don't have this problem. For example, The Dark Knight, I don't have these similar issues with that movie and that movie has a lot of low lighting scenes. I'm not a film expert so I'm sure there is a reason/explanation for this.  Purchase price: $9.99
1451648537|4.0|Interesting book, and gives the reader a close up picture of the highs/lows, good/questionable traits that make up a type of creative genius.  I wouldn't trade places with him, but the world needs more creative people.  It would be interesting to know if he could have accomplished more had he been nicer to people.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and even though it was entertaining, it wasn't great. I suppose I was expecting Pixar quality characters and that's my fault since this is not a Pixar film. Nonetheless, for $11.99, this is a great addition to my animated movie collection and would recommend at least watching it once.   Movie also comes with codes that allow you to get 15 extra levels in the Angry Birds: RIO edition plus 2 free music downloads from Costco (Costco downloads expire 11/30/11). Also get additional coloring sheets for the Color With Blu App.

B005X7HAAS|3.0|Two yakuza families that were once able to co-exist thanks to a pact made by their bosses while the two were in prison soon find themselves at each other's throats after there are a few hiccups in the drug trafficking side of the business. The Ikemoto family and the Murase family are in the middle of a war as the chairman the two crime syndicates answer to continues to pull the strings. Sekuichi (Kitamura Soichiro), the boss of the Sannokai, tells his right-hand man Ikemuto (Kunimura Jun) to put the Murase family in line. Since Ikemuto and Murase (Renji Ishibashi) are still under their pact at this point, Ikemuto passes the assignment onto his subordinate Otomo (Takeshi Kitano), who takes matters into his own hands with his own gang.<br /><br />I probably have a fairly limited amount of knowledge when it comes to Takeshi Kitano's films since I've only seen a handful and have yet to see his most prestigious films. With that said, I've seen enough to know who the guy is, admire his work, and at least look forward to his upcoming projects. When it came to Outrage, it seemed like an undiscovered gem right from the start. Another yakuza film made and starring Beat Takeshi? It sounds like the type of movie you'd willingly pay whatever price for without blinking an eye. That isn't really the case though as Outrage fails to really leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />Walking away from Outrage, you'll probably only be left with its bloody violence and not much else. Everybody was chopping off their fingers left and right to apologize. It was amazing so many of these guys still had any appendages left at all. But the violence gets pretty vicious at times; a box cutter to the face, countless people getting shot to death, chopsticks being used in a fairly unique way, and it even features one of the worst ways a dental appointment could go. Other than the brutality though, all of the events that transpired felt very underwhelming due to them being similar to most other gangster and yakuza films out there. Nothing was shocking or unpredictable; it all felt very safe. Most of my yakuza film watching experience falls under Takashi Miike's filmography. Miike is able to make a film about anything and take it in a direction you're not expecting while adding his own trademarks to it. While Outrage felt like a Takashi Kitano film, it didn't really seem like anything he hadn't already accomplished before. It almost felt recycled from both his films and other films similar to Outrage. The film also lacked any sort of supporting female character as most women in the film were used as props or were disposed of rather quickly. It's incredibly disappointing as well as Outrage had loads of potential, but was never really able to push anything past that mediocre barrier. Its use of perspective is intriguing at times, but doesn't make up for a film that comes off like it isn't willing to take any risks.<br /><br />It's not so much that Outrage is a bad film because it isn't. It's actually a fairly solid crime film. Its biggest issue is that it fails to live up to expectations given the cast and Takeshi Kitano's reputation for being a part of films that are generally a lot better than this. Outrage tends to feel very familiar. If you've seen a gangster or yakuza film before, then you know what to expect with Outrage. With its explosive use of violence and rather eye-catching cinematography, Outrage isn't the type of film you should make a high priority to go out of your way to see but is generally pretty decent once you do finally get around to it.out there.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have annoyed my family for days, walking around the house with my iPad, reading this biography, itching to discuss the details that fascinated me:  Jobs' personality glitches, his perfectionism, his flashes of invention or insight.<br /><br />It has been pure pleasure to learn about the technological innovations that have been milestones of my life:  the Apple II that weaned me from my typewriter, the Macintosh (and swapping those little blue discs), the iPod that rocked me through a 5K \\"fun\\" run, the iPhone that's pretty much imbedded in my hand. Jobs is quoted saying, \\"A lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow.\\"  Jobs didn't just add to the flow; he moved the entire course of the river.<br /><br />I thought I knew much of this story, and I was wrong.  Jobs is far more confounding, the relationships and rivalries far more complex.  I have at least 50 passages highlighted just so I can share the \\"wow\\" moments with family and friends who read it after me.<br /><br />What's next for Apple?  So many of these innovations would have died but for the crazy persistence, grandiosity, and perfectionism of Steve Jobs.  I could never have worked for him, and might not have enjoyed knowing him, but I'm in awe of the intuitive, obsessive genius who really did change the world.

0756665949|5.0|No other show can compare. This product is a perfect companion for a true LOST fan. The glossy pictures, and great detail engulfs you into the world of LOST again and it makes you want to get out your DVDs and have an all day marathon. The biographies of the characters are in good detail, and you even have smaller-role characters included. There are some neat LOST facts throughout that you might not expect, but it is not a surprise seeing as LOST was all about interesting information coming at you. I highly recommend this purchase for the LOST fan that wants a piece of memorabilia and a fun read.

0920668372|1.0|This book is read and cherished by mothers of sons.  This book reinforces a mother's greatest wish.  \\"I cared for him for a long time, changed his diapers, wiped his tears.  Now even though he has married a woman who is not NEAR good enough for him, and whom I disregard, he will come back to me when I need him and he will change MY diapers (ewwww), and wipe MY tears.  This so-called spouse he has selected might not usurp my power over him, at least when I grow old and feeble and needy.\\"  THAT is the meaning of the book when I read it.  I would bet that the majority of proponents of this book are females who have high hopes of reciprocity from their grown sons.  Mother-love for a son is sacred, but surely defining it doesn't include crawling on her belly, or climbing ladders, or totally ignoring his wife.  We are wise to seek out more healthy books with which to teach this to our children.
159448385X|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  It did have a few slow spots, but the story was at it's best when the two women's lives became one.  I am thankful to be a woman living in the U.S., rather than in the Middle East.  The only thing I didn't like was that I think Khaled Hosseini did a better job writing the Kite Runner, because he was a man, writing from a man's perspective.  In this book he tried to write from the womens' perspectives, and I don't think he did as well.
B005SJIP2S|5.0|Honestly, some of these negative reviews are baffling to me. I am finding this album a VERY pleasant surprise! A surprise in the sense that when I initially heard about this release I thought the band and record label were making some mistakes-- first, releasing a live album so soon after the outstanding FLY FROM HERE which came out only 4 months ago, and second, the fact that the material here is from before the release of that album, meaning that there's no new material.  HOWEVER...the setlist is anything but a disappointment. Sure, you're always gonna get the old classics like Roundabout, I've Seen All Good People, Starship Trooper, etc... but in addition to those we get Tempus Fugit (!), Machine Messiah (!!), Onward (!!!), and Astral Traveler (!!!!). And I have to say, I think Benoit David does a brilliant job of interpreting all of this material. The old warhorses like Roundabout and Yours is no Disgrace sound fresh to me.  The performances here are really excellent. There are a few flubs here and there, as there are with most live albums, but for the most part they are spot on and playing with a great deal of emotion. After reading other reviews with contrary opinions to this, I guess I'll have to conclude that beauty is in the ear of the behearer.  I'm thrilled with this release and anxiously anticipating the next move these guys make.
B000001DYY|5.0|I don't know the history of the band, and don't care. Power pop will probably never eclipse this. As of \\"now,\\" this album is -- cripes! -- nearly 20 years old. It still sounds great.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app itself is very good but, the main problem with the Amazon app store is the lack of updates. It's really rediculous that every app I have ever gotten from here was outdated. Amazon needs to fix this problem quick!
B0013K6WLM|4.0|Love this album, however, it's not as in the old days of the Black Keys. Still digging every track on the cd, and it's nice that the boys tried something different, but I still love the old stuff best. If this is your intro to the Black Keys, I hope you love it, but to get a real sense of what the Black Keys are really about, you must  listen to \\"THE BIG COME UP\\" and \\"THICKFREAKNESS\\"....and must listen to \\"CHULAHOMA\\", their tribute to Junior Kimbrough.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My only complaint is the Kindle price. Way to high for an ebook. No expense of material, printing, labor, shipping or storage. Create digital copy, encode and copy to reader. Does it really cost 15 dollars to do that? After you pay the author, publisher and digital providers, the rest is pure profit.<br /><br />Regarding the story, Stephen King did a fantastic job in telling this tale. The concept of time travel to change history has always been a great passion of mine. Please read it for what it is... a fantastic story.<br /><br />As I stated above, my ONLY complaint is the Kindle price.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I can't believe i almost didn't buy this album. I love Björk but i wasn't really into the whole concept of what the album was about. But i got it anyway and gave it a try. I have listened to it just ONE time and it has completely blew me away. The album focuses on things of nature and things that happen all around us as metaphors for human relationships and our being.  The reason i am calling BIOPHILIA a masterpiece while i've only listened to it once is because anyone who knows Björk's music is aware that it takes a very long while to realize the sheer genius of her work. It took me about a month listening to HOMOGENIC to realize it's sheer massive beauty. and i didn't even like it at frist! But listening to this album, i fell in love with it upon first listen. and i can tell it's only going to get better and better with time. The lyrics, the mataphors, the melodies, her voice. All come together to form a great piece of art. I love this album and i'm gonna go ahead and say it. It could be her BEST YET!
1400069181|4.0|DISCLOSURE: I was selected to participate in TOMS Shoe's \\"Books for Bloggers\\" program. I received two copies of \\"Start Something That Matters.\\" One copy was mine to read and review, while the other was meant for me to give away. While this post is about my review, details on the giveaway can be found on my blog at: [..]<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to hear TOMS founder and Chief Shoe Giver Blake Mycoskie speak at the 2011 Association of Fundraising Professionals International Conference and was so inspired that I bought a pair of TOMS that night (I even wore them during my wedding two months later!). Blake's book offered what was so appealing about hearing him in person -- an inspiring and unassuming tale about making a difference in the world. The prose is not complex, yet the message sticks deep inside of anyone who has ever dreamed of being part of something bigger than him or herself.<br /><br />I read the bulk of \\"Start Something That Matters\\" while commuting to and from work on Chicago's el. As I was reading, I tweeted the passages (@matthewsm1th) that most resonated with me...here are the quotes and context (full post at [..]<br /><br />\\"Increasingly, the tried-and-true tenets of success are just tried, not true.\\" -- This quote was found in SSTM's opening pages and its quirky word play was what inspired me to tweet out interesting passages as I came across them. Though I usually abhor puns and think they scream \\"GIMMICK,\\" I believe that Blake has truly touched on something valuable; today's business world is long on advice, but short on originality and risk-taking. The same can't be said for Blake himself, nor for TOMS Shoes...which should become apparent as you continue to read.<br /><br />\\"Stories are the most primitive and purest form of communication.\\" -- Blake is big on story-telling and attributes it to TOMS' success. Anyone can make a cool, comfortable pair of shoes...but TOMS was able to connect product with passion. Their customers feel like partners and ambassadors, all because of a compelling and inspiring story.<br /><br />\\"If you doubt your own authenticity, it will sap your passion.\\" -- Think about your contacts in the business and/or nonprofit world. Now think about the people who personally commit to their product/mission...and think about the ones that \\"just\\" do their jobs. My guess (and Blake's hypothesis) is that you'll see two distinct groups emerge -- one that's passionate and successful, the other that's ambivalent and middling.<br /><br />\\"What distinguishes the ultimate successes from the ultimate failures is what you do with them.\\" -- Sometimes, there's a fine line between good and bad...between pass and fail...between success and failure. Blake suggests that it's not so much the idea that dictates a project's success, but the drive and reactions of the person or people implementing it.<br /><br />\\"Lack of resources inspires creativity... It's one one of the reasons @TOMS succeeded.\\" -- One of the most compelling (and easy to replicate) parts of the TOMS story is how the company started on a shoe-string budget and found success before it was logistically ready to handle it. How did Blake avoid business disaster? By staying simple, exploring every possible cheap/free option and resisting the urge to burn capital (ahem, pets.com) simply because it was available.<br /><br />\\"Simplicity is simple. Perhaps this sounds redundant. But it's true, and it's important.\\" -- Nuff said.<br /><br />\\"Your org's next great idea may come from...the top down, bottom up or zigzagging thru the middle.\\" -- Power to the people! Organizational hierarchy is often important, but Blake suggests that it not come at the expense of innovation. Often, the best insights can come from those employees with ears closest to the ground. Make sure you set up a system in which their observations are collected, appreciated and acted upon.<br /><br />\\"Being clear about where your donors' money goes is the best way to build their trust.\\" -- This is gospel to fundraisers, but cringe-inducing to many of our accounting offices. Yes, transparency requires a lot of extra effort...effort that will be rewarded tenfold by loyal, appreciative and increasingly well-educated nonprofit donors.<br /><br />\\"Compliment publicly and criticize privately, but do both directly.\\" -- What a great business tip! This one has already gone into my rotation.<br /><br />\\"Incorporate giving in2 ur business model & give ur business a mission larger than ur bottom line\\" @BlakeMycoskie<br /><br />\\"Giving feels good. But...giving is truly good for business as well.\\"<br /><br />\\"When giving is incorporated into ur business model, customers become product marketing partners.\\" -- These passages appear in different sections of the book, but I've united them here because the message is a common one.While not every for-profit business can or should work on TOMS' \\"one for one\\" model, Blake (and a growing number of other business leaders) suggests that to build loyalty among customers, today's companies need a connection to social good. You may not be able to give away a million pairs of shoes to children in third world countries, but your customers will appreciate and reward your genuine efforts to make a difference in your local community.

B005PMNBNG|5.0|The obvious place to start a review for this album is with its expansive sound.  It manages to stay epic through fast songs (\\"This Bright Flash;\\" some of the album's coolest drumming), to ambient interludes (\\"Train to Pluton,\\" for example), without sounding tacky, and that is hard to do.  What amazes me about M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, is its expansive style.  Granted, he gives us twenty two tracks on the double album, and so he has plenty to work with; but the entire album manages to work together while exploring a wide range of sonic territory.  He does things like use natural sound samples (birds at the end of \\"Fountains\\") and draws them in direct contrast with highly digitized sounds (seconds later in \\"Steve McQueen\\"), but he buries them all in a wave of slow, baroque shoegaze synthesizers, bass, and drums.  In creating this consistent musical \\"scene,\\" he is able to experiment to a huge variety of timbres.    But this is not just Anthony Gonzales.  Or, if Anthony Gonzales is M83, then there is more than M83 on this double.  Zola Jesus, appearing in \\"Intro,\\" sounding almost like a more harnessed Gonzalez in similar range but absent of Gonzalez' distinct, accented wail on the phrase's high notes.  Gonzalez made a good choice in having the album produced by Justin Meldal-Johnson, a fantastic bass player who has worked with a range of artists including Beck, Macy Gray, Jamiroquai, and Gonzalez's fellow Frenchmen Air. Johnson's stylistic range in bass-playing shows itself in songs like the funky Claudia Lewis, his 16th note section in \\"Reunion,\\" or the almost Strokesy ending of the epically playful \\"Raconte-Moi Une Histoire.\\" His past work as a band director for major outfits is evident in the way that the album is mixed, with almost equal reverence given to each song's arsenal of tracks.  The credits on this album are fittingly long and expansive, only bolstered by the monologues and dialogues spoken into the mix.  What I love about the album is the way that the electroacoustics factor in.  Having a wide range of voices from choirs and choruses, to monologues written to the piece by Gonzalez and his filmmaker brother, he is able to incorporate other natural-sound samples without making the listener flinch.  Acoustic instruments are never put on the chopping block as the only acoustic instrument.  Gonzalez gives you a better picture of the continuum, implementing related timbres to make everything work within his massive soundscape.  He and Gonzalez keep any singular melody line from poking out in the mix. He uses acoustic guitar, like on \\"Soon, My Friend,\\" and he incorporates the timbre without sounding awkward because his synthesizer tones are so expansive.  He opens up a wide spectrum of sounds for himself to play with by focusing on layers, and incorporating a wide range of instrumentation and synthesized sound.    These are considerate, heartfelt songs.  For this reason there is almost a folk-indie flavor, augmented by the frequency of Gonzalez's distinct voice relative to his prior albums.  In his idea, to write a brother-sister double album in which songs from the brother's perspective would correspond to songs on the sister disk, he again cannot be blamed for aiming too low.  The extent to which he pulls this off is debatable.  Regardless, such a thorough, time-invested plan for the album results in songs that are carefully constructed with great consideration for their overall efficacy.  They create a correspondent whole.  As he recently told musicOMH interviewer Ben Hogwood, \\"This album for me is kind of a soundtrack of an imaginary movie, or some kind of life as well. The soundtrack needs to have deserts and mountains, and there are some epic moments but also some very quiet ones.\\"  This cinematic quality is perhaps reflected in Gonzalez's method.  Gonzalez drove into the desert from his home in LA with a computer and keyboards, rented an isolated cabin, and using \\"a modular system, from synthesizer.com - it's like a Moog replica,\\" as he told Hogwood, to construct the first draft of his work.  He goes on, in this and other interviews, to comment on the way that his songs are in a way inspired by environmental vastness and monumentality.  As Stereogum reporter T. Cole Rachel recently pointed out, Gonzalez always manages to \\"to create sounds that are somehow both retro and futuristic at the same time.\\"  Maybe the songs' timeless element has something to do with their being conceived in desert, where there are fewer indicators of time's presence.   Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is Anthony Gonzales trying to conceive of music in as big a way as the kind of sound he has a knack for creating.  Hence, he makes a double album.  It is complex lyrically (even featuring foreign languages), textually, and rhythmically.  On the first listen, it is a lot to take in.  It requires your attention one moment, and the next will sound like falling asleep - or waking up.  Gonzalez has no qualms about making his pride for the record known, and he has every right to be proud.  It has the depth - the short songs, the brief moments and layers that capture one's attention only after half a dozen listens - that Gonzalez loves about albums like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness or The Beatles; double albums that demand to be treated as a reflection of an artistic existence, and feature the sonic vehicles with which to fulfill that existence.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|all I can say is the series on a whole is an absolute work of art, on so many levels.
B005TQACLC|3.0|The video quality is like seeing a dvd instead a blu-ray, I expected much more.<br />I think that Britney do the best she can at the moment, i've seen her live and it was almost lipsync ......this bluray sounds entire lipsynced.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the funniest show on television.  Writers and all characters are first rate.  I plan on buying the entire series.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|A good yet flawed effort. Mylo Xyloto has a lot of great material but falls short on several counts. I'm a bit amused to see some reviews hailing it as a masterpiece. In any case, there are several problems with the album.  - Poorly produced. A lot of the songs have no variation in tempo at all with a lot of distortion. Paradise, while a great melody, sounds like the life has been sucked out of the song. 'Dont let it break your heart' would've been a classic song were it not for the abrupt start with an equally abrupt ending. Princess in China would have been a far more interesting song without Rihanna - the song needed edgier vocals - CM should have taken the lead.  - The album is a bit light on material and heavy on gimmick intros that add nothing.  Ideally each intro should have been added to the following song. 'Hurts like Heaven' is a bit of a fluffy track and sounds quite generic.The band should have put an additional couple of real tracks on the album. For a start, Moving to Mars should have been on the CD.   - And finally, most of the songs are around 4 mins or so - a bit short in my opinion.   Unlike their 2005 masterpiece, most of the songs in MX are simply are not long enough to showcase more depth and layering as opposed to some of the classic X&Y tracks ('White Shadows' , 'Message', Speed of Sound' and 'Low') and tend to just vary between extremes, really soft piano or really high tempo. Coldplay missed a trick here. The band should seriously think about cutting more tracks in the 5 minute range for their next album.
014241543X|5.0|Im just.... speechless. This book, gave me goosebumps all the way. The feelings i had while reading this book, were sadness, happiness, joy, love, it was just EVERYTHING. This book touched me to the bottom of my heart. I honestly never expected it to be this good. It was beautiful. I loved the way it was written, how one chapter were flashbacks, and how the other chapter was in the present. That way, the author allowed us to know the past and present of the characters, which made me connect with them even more.<br />This book taught me a lot, especially to appreciate every second i live. The reason i loved this book, was because it made me feel, that maybe this is what you might approach some day in your life. To choose a decision, that might be as important as life and death. When that time comes, we have to be strong right? Thats exactly what this book showed me.<br />While reading this book, i cried alot. It hurt me, like a whole in my heart. But that doesn't mean i wouldn't read it again. Like, i dont really care i cried, because i enjoyed it you know?<br />If you didnt read this book, and if you like books that make you cry and arent all happy happy, you should totally give it a shot and read it. There is also a sequel to it called \\"Where She Went\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  You do not have to be a young adult to read it.  Characters are well thought out and storyline is engaging.
0062112430|5.0|I started reading Delirium because of the TBR intervention weekly Meme and I'm GLAD I picked this book. This book got me hooked from page one. I LOVED the protagonist, though at the beginning she was a bit too goody goody and followed all the rules, but as soon as she met Alex, everything changed. Alex was the one who opened up a switch to her brain, he made her see what life really is about, he showed her how to think of herself, he guided her, ever so gently, to the truth, even if it might hurt him. I loved Alex from the first time he was introduced. He winked! You know I'm always a victim of winks.<br /><br />Hana was a character that I cautiously liked. At the beginning because she seemed to always have a mind of her own, speak out about things that are even forbidden to think about, and I felt like Hana would cause the problems. I was afraid of their friendship dissolving but in a way you can say that Alex saved that from happening. Towards the end I felt like Hana would be a hindrance to their plans. So you can see why I was very cautious about Hana, but in the end, she was a character you can't but love. Another Character that I loved and wish that maybe a spinoff would end up being created for is Grace. She's six years old and a resistor at heart! Lena loved her so much, and so did I.<br /><br />The romance between Alex and Lena did not feel rushed, I usually have that problem with books, when the characters suddenly fall madly in love and I'm left thinking \\"When did THAT happen?\\" so I liked the pace of their romance, I loved how Alex took care of her, didn't push her, let her think for HERSELF, even though most of the time she was lost and confused, and I loved how no matter what in the end he would do anything for her. That is so heartbreakingly beautiful. Yes I've been infected, I have contracted deliria *gasp*, bring out the shackles and watchdogs and put me in Ward 6 now! (Joke you'll get once you read the book).<br /><br />People said the ending would be jaw dropping, and that's exactly what happened. I was shocked, immobile, mentally counting the days till pandemonium is out. The book is phenomenal; a book I would recommend for anyone, romance, dystopian, contemporary lovers, it has a bit of everything really.actly what happened. I was shocked, immobile, mentally counting the days till pandemonium is out.

B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is a very good singer. I really just enjoy her 80s work but I also like her later stuff like the song Vogue. I did not really for the last 2 Justify my love and Rescue me. I got it for a 1.99 at a record store. I really did not want to have paid that much for it. I also noticed that some songs are different. Material girl is a different version because the one I know ends in a fade. Her song like a prayer is also very different more disco and different music in it. It's still a very good CD and if you are a Madonna fan I would suggest it.  Enjoy!
B004H4XDBI|4.0|My sister and I fell in love with \\"If I Stay\\". Yes I was the one who cried constantly from the beginning of the book but we both came out of this book breathless and heartbroken. The idea of losing my family is unbearable and reading how she went through it? Just open up my heart and slice it will you?<br /><br />Yes this isn't a post about \\"If I Stay\\" but its sequel \\"Where She Went\\". If you've read the first book you'll know its told from the perspective of Mia, however I was surprised when I found out the second book is told from the perspective of Adam. That.Was.Awesome. I was SO bummed out when Stephanie Meyer stopped writing Midnight Sun which is the perspective of Edward. I always love it when I get to read both sides of the story so it was very refreshing.<br /><br />\\"Where She Went\\" does not rip your heart out, it maybe pinches it but you recover automatically, I didn't cry *shocker* so overall it was a `happier' story. It's set three years after the accident, Adam is a rock star and Mia is a classical music prodigy. There is the flashbacks and the hurt and confusion Adam has kept pent up in his heart because of Mia's sudden disconnect from him. Again the whole book is set in one day of their life. I guess you can say Gayle Forman's books are more about the emotions and internal conflicts and reality. So while if you think about it the story can be summarized in a couple of lines but the FEELINGS and EMOTIONS that the characters and yourself experience can't be summarized, at all, trust me I've tried.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, it wasn't as emotionally deep and heart wrenching as \\"If I Stay\\" but it was nice to know what has happened to the two main leads for the long run. I didn't understand the reason for Mia leaving Adam and also blaming him, but what do I know? I've never had to go through what she went through.<br /><br />Adam truly loved Mia and it showed through this book. He might just be one of my top fictional character crushes.
B00319ECGK|4.0|The Dolby HD mode is 5.1, should be made to 7.1~  A classic movie.  The best one of the Matrix Trilogy.
0545259088|4.0|Forever was such an amazing book. I honestly didn't expect it to be this good because I was disappointed in linger, even though I loved shiver. Funny thing is that at the beginning I hated how the trilogy is told from many people's points of view. Cole, Isabel, Sam, Grace. All I cared about was Sam and Grace which is why I wasn't happy with linger; but this book? I LOVED Cole and Isabel. They actually had back stories, and I just fell in love with Cole. How a rock star is scientist smart and tries to find a cure from werewolf-ism. I found the whole experimenting parts so interesting! I'm such a science nerd  so this was pretty awesome for me.<br /><br />The characters here are more dynamic, more deep and 4 dimensional. They each had a meaningful story, a hidden secret, fear, longing, that made them more real and humane. That is why I truly enjoyed forever. Also, the connection and love between Grace and Sam can't go unmentioned. Their love is so strong and pure; it's hard to imagine such an unconditional love. I wished there was more into Grace's story towards the end. There were many untied loose ends and also the ending is open ended. This might have annoyed me, I usually want closure!, but I feel it is very fitting for this book. Ending the book in a `happily ever after' or ending it with a tragedy would just seem rushed and unsatisfactory, so I'm happy with the ending.<br /><br />The wolves of Mercy Fall trilogy is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy paranormal books with a hint of romance! I'm sad this is the end of this trilogy but I'm also excited Maggie Stiefvater's new book \\"The Scorpio Race\\" is out very soon! The synopsis is just crazy awesome, I can't wait to read it!
0060873027|1.0|Listened to the audio version during a long road trip. The concept is interesting, but the painfully terrible dialogue, predictable plot, shallow typecast characters and plot inconsistencies make this book awful. Really, really awful. We were actually laughing over some of the dialogue - it's so bad, we didn't hit the eject button for fear we would miss the next cliche. It did keep us focused - we had quite a conversation about how bad this book is. Avoid unless your eyes need exercise - ours spent quite a lot of time rolling.
0142419400|5.0|I dont even know how to start, or what to say. One thing for sure is that, this book is PERFECT. I LOVED IT! I LOOOOVED IT! AND I LOOOOOVVEEEEE IT!!!! *sqeaal*<br /><br />I have read MANY reviews for this book, and many people told me that they loved it, but i just never got the nerves to start it. I was scared that once i start reading it, it might be a disappointment, you know? When people keep telling you something is amazing amazing amazing. You have high expectations for it, so i was scared it wont  live up to my expectation. BUT DAMN IT DID! It blew me away. I was never disappointed, and now i understand why EVERYBODY is squealing about this lovely book.<br /><br />Lets talk about the characters now. Anna is the protagonist, and i loved her. She felt like she was a real person to me. When i would read, i can feel her emotions, and everything she does feels just so real and believable. I can actually relate to everything she does. I can actually understand her.<br /><br />St.Clair/Etienne, oh Gosh lovely lovely St.Clair. *sigh* He's so perfect.... *sigh* .. i love his hair *sigh* okay okay enough of me drooling over him, but he is truly a perfect character. I loved him. I loved his hair, his smile, his accent, oh GOD his accent ! Who wouldnt love his accent? Now St.Clair was described so good that i can imagine EVERYTHING about him, and now, i feel like he's a memory of a guy i met ;) haha oh how i wish i actually met him.<br /><br />His relationship with Anna felt so real. It was not perfect, but thats just how life is eh? It NOT perfect, and thats what makes it so real, special, and believable. It was lovely, and i loved every bit of this book. Really, a HUGE thumbs up to our dear Stephanie.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|Product came in a timely manner, and was wrapped very nicely with bubble wrap. No issues, would buy from this company again
B004H7QICG|4.0|Great overall case, however it may not be the best choice for gaming. There's no easy way to do spot-cooling on the video card, as my old case had.  I realize this may have potentially made the case louder, but having an option would have been nice.  I also didn't like the cable for the front USB 3.0 port - there has to be a better option than having a cable pass through the case and plug into the back USB port.  This was a pain to configure, and looks ugly!  However despite those limitations, it's still a great case, and I would buy again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|this was an excellent purchase, i ordered it express, came in two days. :)  star wars is awesome obviously, and the case was filled with graphics all inside, came with a booklet, and like 2 hours i think of even star wars spoofs!!
0517548232|3.0|It's ironic that the author describes how many economists are opinionated, and then proceeds to give very opinionated views himself!  This book seems to be aimed towards projecting a political viewpoint, rather than explaining underlying economic principles.  It's like buying a book about US History, only to have the author give us his opinion on each President.  Explain the economic fundamentals, and let us make up our own minds!  I agree with many of the author's opinions, but I bought the book to learn about economics.  This is definitely not \\"The shortest and surest way to understand basic economics\\".
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the gripping story of a child's struggle for personal survival, set in the shadow of humanity's struggle for survival against an unknowable, incomprehensible enemy.<br /><br />Andrew Wiggins, known to his siblings as Ender, has been born as part of his country's search for the ultimate military commander.  The book starts when he is six years old, a prodigy who is slowly learning that who he is will forever interfere with his attempts to form relationships with family and friends.  As he goes through his training, his relationships and mindset evolve.  But is he learning what his teachers want, or will he ultimately fall to pieces under the strain?  Is the enemy really the alien presence out among the stars waiting to pounce and destroy everything he has ever loved, or is it much closer to home?<br /><br />The book is set mostly in two different training facilities, where Ender interacts with children who are his own age, but not his equals.  We also see how Ender's older sister and brother deal with being bred as he was, but passed over for the battle training he is being given.<br /><br />Although I often found Ender's inner thoughts and strategies a stretch for a six-year-old boy, I found his overall progression very believable.  I was drawn into both his struggle and the struggle of the adults around him who felt that they were doing what was absolutely necessary.  I first read this book at a young age, probably around 14 to 16, and while I enjoyed it I did not understand the full ramifications of each character's decisions.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for anyone who loves science fiction.  Because of the psychological and social issues that are at stake and discussed in the book and the death of several characters, I would recommend it for ages 15 and above on the Aardvark scale.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|A lot of reviews I have seen seem to bemoan the somewhat different sound on this album, but I've also noticed that a lot of the naysayers are looking for a sound closer to Parachutes.  Unfortunately for them, that is not even close to happening.  This album sounds like Coldplay to me.  Wanting Parachutes out of them now would be like expecting Radiohead to put out an album like Pablo Honey instead of the wonderful Amnesiac.  In fact, my feelings are that Coldplay are very similar to Radiohead in this respect.  Both bands have evolved over the course of albums, and continue to do so.  This album, much like Radiohead's Amnesiac, just feels right.  Granted, this album sounds more accessible and pop-esque than Amnesiac.  Just because it is easily accessible does not make it bad.  It is slick and polished, (some may argue overproduced) but it still sounds great and is most certainly recognizable as a Coldplay offering as long as you're willing to keep moving forward like the band is, instead of wishing that they'd sound more like their Freshman effort.  Bands, just like people, change over time.  It's good to see bands like Coldplay and Radiohead embracing this.  This is a truly great album.

B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Sitting out in the snow back in December Of 1994 when I was only 17 years old out in the country in Urbana Mo I went to Skyline High School where at the time was Christmas Vacation and at that time when my mom and StepDad was going through a Divorce and mom told us that we had to move to Bolivar Mo. and mom could not Afford Christmas that year so I went out in the Woods to Find a Christmas Tree because we could not afford one so we made popcorn for ornements and the paper Strimmers that you connect together and put around the tree. we Surprised mom with the tree but mom started to cry because she new that she could not afford any Christmas Presents that year so we decided to take down the tree because we did not want mom upset. That Previous year mom gave me for Christmas a Walkman and Madonna Immaculate Collection So this year I had Nothing and my two brothers and two Sisters Excepted it because Family Comes First and Christmas is not all about Presents or a Tree its all about the lord and Family!!! So I Decided one night when it was Christmas Eve when everyone was a sleep to go outside when it was snowing and there was already snow on the ground from previous Days I took my walkman and put in Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas Album That I recieved from Secret Santa From a Classmate at school and I set there in the snow I never heard such Beauty in Music Before. As I sit and Listen to Christmas Music I looked up at the stars and the Moon Letting the snow hit my face and I felt In my Heart that with Mariah's Music in my heart and the love of the lord, my family will make it through. Wishing you all a Very Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year to come!!!!

098357670X|5.0|This book is even more informative, exciting, and colorful than I thought it would be before getting it.  It teaches not only how to position the unique features everyone on the planet has, but how those shapes and size's are affected by attitude.  When we first look at the task of capturing a face, it can be overwhelming.  Tom does an especially good job of demonstrating techniques for blocking in the basic shapes, sizes, and relationships of features before getting to the details.  The lessons, some of which I have seen elsewhere, are far more likely to sink in, in large part because of Tom's enthusiastic and well crafted drawing style.  This is also why the book will not seem dated as the year's go by.  Clearly he had fun doing this, and like me, I think everyone will have fun reading and learning how to see.
044651506X|4.0|Bestselling authors certainly have their days. Don't they? That was most certainly the case when I decided to begin reading Nelson DeMille, starting with \\"Spencerville.\\" I felt like my time had been wasted, to a point, anyway. But I thought the writing was exceptional, just that the story was, for the most part, incredibly boring. However, I did know that DeMille was beyond a stand-alone author, and I knew that \\"Plum Island\\" might be a good book to give him his second chance. Now, this is more like it!<br /><br />Welcome to the world of wise-cracking, wounded in the line of duty, NYPD Detective John Corey. Yeah, the man has kind of a smart mouth on him, but he's good at what he does, and everybody knows it. That's why local police Chief Maxwell is in contact with him from the get-go. There was a double murder, and friends of Corey were the ones who got did in. They worked as biologists Plum Island. So what? Plum Island is off limits to most people, due to the research done there, what with animals and all. So does this mean something shady has gone down? It sure looks that way.<br /><br />Once Corey gets involved, he continues to have questions. And those questions raise red flags to certain people, and they don't put those people in the mood to relax with a glass of wine after a hard day. But when people start getting killed that Corey has just started getting close to, this gets personal, and real quick!<br /><br />I love it when John Corey says he doesn't like mysteries, which is why he likes to solve them. Brilliant! All in all, this is good stuff. This is the Nelson DeMille I was looking forward to reading, and it kept the pages flipping rather quickly. So, I didn't like what \\"Spencerville\\" had to offer all that well? Who cares? I did enjoy this, and it gives me more of a reason to continue reading DeMille. Can't wait for next time!

B005Y423ZC|5.0|The video and audio quality of this DVD, and the CD that accompanies it, are top-notch. Adele's voice is amazing and the crowd is electric, participating in many of the songs, especially the last two songs, \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\" She covers three songs in the concert, but her rendition of the Steeldrivers song, \\"If it Hadn't Been for Love,\\" is a wonderful surprise. It has a country twang to it, with a banjo playing along. Adele was suffering from a respiratory infection, but her voice is still close to perfect. Buy this DVD and I promise it will not disappoint, especially if you are already a fan.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Love this album. Even better than 'need you now'. The way their voices blend together is just incredible. I haven't seen another band that can cooperate this well. Also the songs are all about everyday life and they are so passionate. I cannot stop singing these songs and they make me happy no matter what a bad day I just had ~
0756405890|5.0|It's nice to find a modern fantasy writer who brings both a scientific consistency and a mastery of prose to the table.  Many modern works boast a good story but little style, or pretend to a historic mode of writing.  Patrick Rothfuss' work simply is an excellent story that is very well written.  I can't wait to read his next book.

B00001W9G0|5.0|In my opinion, one of the best Sydney Pollack efforts. The screenplay is a little jewel of cleverness and this love story between the Verb and the Image, between the word spoken and the word written deserves to stay in movie history. Masterpiece.

B004IFYMWK|2.0|** 1/2 I really don't know what differentiates Fair Game from a good TV movie. Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Sam Shepard maybe. Otherwise, one may rejoice that a democracy like the U.S.A. can still produce movies about its administration's hiccups. Now that everyone is happy and has a good conscience, why not regret a time, not so distant after all, that allowed such directors as Alan J. Pakula, Sydney Pollack or John Frankenheimer to direct much more powerful films ? This one is already forgotten. Unfortunately.
1400069181|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm pushing thirty or because I'm the mother of two children who are becoming increasingly aware of the world around them, but I began to feel like I wasn't doing enough of anything worthwhile with my time. It's what drew me into finding my purpose and in turn what drew me to Blake Mycoskie's book, Start Something That Matters.   By now, we have all seen those cute slide-on shoes with TOMS stitched on the back. We know that they're simple in design, relatively inexpensive, and somehow always manage to be in style, particularly on college campuses worldwide. Unfortunately, if you're anything like me that might be just about all that you know. But not for long.   The first thing Start Something That Matters lets you in on is that Toms is not your typical company and wild-haired, board-short-wearing Mycoskie is far from a typical CEO. An acronym for Shoes for Tomorrow (which above all finally solved the mystery as to why a guy named Blake would have a company called Toms), Toms ensures that with every pair of shoes purchased a child in need receives a pair of shoes too. It is instant charity for a generation of people who want to give but usually don't have the first idea how to go about it. The simplicity of the concept is incredible; one for you, one for me. When you really stop to think about it, it's amazing that no one thought of it before. What might be more amazing is that Blake Mycoskie doesn't want to hide his secret to success, but rather he wants to share it in hopes that everyone will be inspired enough to start something of their own that matters. Which brings us to me.   Last summer I decided to start a book club. I realize that this isn't the world's most original idea and that on paper a book club might sound boring and old fashioned, but I like to read and frankly I needed some kind of social life in the worst way. To be honest, I tend to join things rather than start them, so even beginning something felt like a huge obstacle. I setup the meetings to be once a month and the first meeting was held in July. Two meetings later and we were up to twenty people. Because of our shared love for books and wine we decided to call ourselves Reading Between The Wines. We are a diverse group of women from all different walks of life, ethnicities, religions and political parties who get along amazingly. That might not sound like that big of a deal, but the thing is, typically women aren't very kind to each other. The sad reality is that movies like \\"Mean Girls\\" are more fact than fiction and all you have to do is turn on any reality TV show to see the image of women as catty backstabbers, who see each other as competition rather than friends. Women have fought long and hard for so many years for equalization and to be seen as being just as intelligent as men, but turn on the TV and it's hard to find anything other than Kardashians or The Real Housewives of Wherever displaying not much more than woman-on-woman hate. And yet, once a month I sit in a room full of women who could have easily let their differences get between them but instead chose to focus on what they have in common, in our case a love of great books and great wine. It gives me hope that together we can change the grotesquely inaccurate stereotype of women and bring the importance of intelligence and friendship to the forefront.    I don't have a product to sell or give away (at least not right now), it's attitudes and prejudices that I want to change. We have big plans for the coming year, including a book drive in January with all books to be donated to the library at the Women's correctional facility, because women should be kind to each other no matter what their situation in life is. In addition to our New Mexico branch, we have expanded to Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, and Oregon with hopes of more branches in the future. It's still pretty fresh, but I already owe much of my inspiration (as well as figuring out the practicalities of a non-profit) to Start Something That Matters.   Start Something That Matters is enlightening and informative, and my only complaint is that it has a tendency to drag at times.  Mycoskie recounts the start-ups that inspired him and cites quotes and passages in a way that can often read a lot like a college term paper. If you're expecting a biography of a man, Mycoskie is quick to let you know that this is the story behind the company, not the story behind the story. In fact, very little of his personal life is revealed at all, aside from an occasional short, well-placed anecdote.   Whether you want to start a for-profit business like Toms or change the world in whatever way you choose, Start Something That Matters is worth a read. Mycoskie offers up so much information, advice, and even free sites to get you started that literally all that is missing from the book is his hand reaching out to physically shove you in the right direction. This isn't taking business advice from Donald Trump or any of the hundreds of questionable CEOs of questionable companies, this is taking advice from someone who is truly practicing what they preach (so much so that he recently trimmed down the unnecessary excess in his own life and now lives in a two hundred square foot sailboat. Can you picture Donald Trump living on a tiny boat? Yeah, me neither). Start Something That Matters is equal parts refreshing and inspiring and will undoubtedly leave all aspiring entrepreneurs shaking in their Toms.

As the other reviewer have said, even if you're not a fan or familiar with the TV series, this soundtrack is still a top notch compilation of excellent covers of classic songs and awesome originals. Katey Segal is an awesome singer as well as a phenomenal actress! Love this CD! As season 4 is coming to an end, SOA leaves us with great music to listen to while awaiting for an exciting season 5!! SOA fans enjoy! Live to ride!

B001DJLCRC|4.0|I'm kinda picky when choosing to check out a new show, but I had never even heard of Breaking Bad, and Amazon and Netflix kept bugging me to watch it via my recommended products, and I finally gave in.  I guess the image for the show (shown here as the cover for the first DVD) had me confused about what the show would feel like perhaps - I was expecting more of a sitcom initially.<br /><br />After finishing up the first season, I feel like the show Breaking Bad is essentially a mix of [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter: The First Season]] and [[ASIN:B000FFJYE8 Weeds: Season One]].  I do not mean to say that it appears to clone these shows, but rather if you tied in the basic elements of each and put them into a brand new show, I think you would end up with Breaking Bad.  I loved both of those shows, and so naturally I felt drawn to this one as well.<br /><br />My main complaint is the main character's personality just feels a little off.  The actor does a great job with it, and I do understand the director's (or whoever's) intention of making the personality come out like it does, but I feel like it is a little much at times, and makes the show feel like it is dragging.  Thankfully, he remains quirky enough that you don't notice it too often.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Fantastic movie from a great director. It feels like an 80's classic in the very best way! Don't be fooled though this does end up being an alien invasion movie and  can shock you in some unexpected places! See this movie.

Also Kevin Spacey and Jamie Fox were HYSTERICAL- actually, Everyone in this movie cracked me up. CLASSIC. Funny Funny movie, haven't laughed this hard since Hangover (the first one of course.) This is not a cute movie like \\"just go with it\\" (which I loved) and it is rather on the crude side, but it is SO MUCH FUN and guaranteed to bring a few belly laughs from its wonderful cast.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|I heard \\"Riverside,\\" of all places, on a television show. It was used as background music, but it caused me to miss the dialogue between the characters in that scene because it was just too beautiful to ignore. I thought all the music choices for that show were good, but there were two that I actively searched out. One, unfortunately, was not listed on the network's website, and I had to give up on it. Except...turns out it was another Agnes Obel track (\\"Avenue\\") on the same CD. What luck! Her harmonization is intoxicating. And I love the way she uses real instruments instead of synthesizers and computers. She has incredible talent, and I highly recommend this album.
B001AQO46E|4.0|I must throw in my 2¢ in about the unavailability of Fox and Sony (Columbia) to release their better movies on Blu Ray.  It's bad enough that Fox screwed widescreen TV owners by releasing many of their titles (including True Lies) as non-anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen TV's), so we didn't even get the best picture on the old DVD format, but now we continue to wait for True Lies.
B000C13Y2S|3.0|got two, one worked great..one was already on..and battery near dead  they should pay attention and make sure both items are identical expecially if they are they same  ...gives a bad reputation.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Just an FYI.  There is a picture of the product uploaded by Jamie G. which seems to showcase that this version of 'Sucker Punch' comes with a Digital Copy, it doesn't.  This Extended BluRay Version contains Two BlurRay discs - One with the Original Theatrical version & the Second with the Extended version. This BluRay does NOT contain the Digital Copy. FYI.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|Tried the product for the first time in the pool. overall, it was very comfortable and stable. Still getting used to it a bit. I learned that the head cannot be too far below water as some water starts entering the tube. It sure beats having to turn the head every three-four strokes. So I'd recommend it.
0446573019|5.0|Zero Day was another in a continuous line of Baldacci's amazing books, all of which captivate, energize and entertain. I have read every book he has published to date and could not put this last one down; I even stole time from the family over Thanksgiving to continue my reading. The story is timely, sets a credible, almost believable scenario and is so well written that one is drawn in to the plot and held captive until the final scene.  I cannot wait until he pens his next one! Once again Amazon has provided this dedicated reader a superb, page-turner. Thank you Baldacci and Amazon.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is a formulaic yet captivating thriller set in a futuristic dystopia. The heroine, Katniss Everdeen, along with 23 other children, is condemned to participate in gladiator fights for the entertainment of wealthy citizens. The competition is a televised free-for-all, spanning several weeks, until only one child remains alive and is declared the victor. There is a good amount of suspense as the competitors are whittled down one-by-one. Many cliff-hangers kept me reading chapter after chapter.   The Hunger Games' rules are simple, the combat arena is expansive but well-defined, and the strengths/weaknesses of the competitors are well rounded. Some children excel at hand-to-hand combat, others at ranged combat. Some children are big and slow, while others are small and fleet. Some children are clever, others are dumb and brutish. You know this story already. Little will surprise you; however, the book is slickly written and is a thrilling read. It is no wonder the Hunger Games has been turned into a movie.   Before they even enter the arena the children compete to win the support of the viewing audience. It is this aspect that somewhat distinguishes the Hunger Games from similar stories. Katniss is advised by a wardrobe coordinator, a personal trainer, and a public relations consultant. They advise Katniss on her training regimen, her posture, her choice of costumes, and how to handle questioning during the critical pre-games interview. With this help Katniss successfully wins the sympathy of the viewers and is rewarded with life-saving gifts in the arena.  Occasionally, the book has a schlocky horror movie vibe that I disliked. The sadistic cruelty and voyeurism of the Capitol citizens, for whom the games are televised, is inhuman and really inexplicable. Why these citizens enjoy watching children die in gruesome battles, with a particular fondness for slow agonizing deaths, is never explained.    I have a similar complaint regarding the \\"muttations\\",wolves genetically crossed with the DNA of children slain in the Hunger Games. These muttations have the recognizable eyes and facial expressions of the children. In my opinion this was real B-grade science fiction fare. I think author Suzanne Collins must have a thing for low-brow sci-fi and voyeuristic horror movies as they seem to have inspired significant portions of the Hunger Games.  The weakest aspects of the book, by far, are the three capricious rule changes. At first, only one child may win. Then that rule is changed to permit two winners. Then reversed back to one winner and finally re-reversed to two winners. This was aggravating and undercut the tension of the one-gets-out-alive scenario. It is too bad some editor didn't tell Collins to cut it out.  Beyond the Hunger Games themselves there is a bit of teenage angst, a bland love triangle, a touching instance of self-sacrifice, and obligatory moments of self-doubt followed by I-will-never-give-up resolve on the part of Katniss. In conclusion, the Hunger Games is formulaic and you will probably fail to be overly impressed with it; however, should you find yourself stuck at the airport I think you will appreciate the plentiful cliff-hangers anyway.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|This item was actually a last minute add-on to a pair of Headphones (namely the ATH M50S) that I was purchasing.  I'm new on the scene of mid-high quality audio, so I was unaware an amp was really necessary.  I'm very very glad that I did a bit of research and found out how much they assist the sound.  This with the M50S sounds amazing.  I did a few comparisons listening with the amp, then without the amp, and the difference is very very apparent.  It makes everything sound much better, and adds some control to the bass.    Also, some of the reviews for this product bash the Bass Boost EQ setting.  Personally I enjoy listening to it on Level 1 or even 2.  Level 3 seems a bit much, but if you're a basshead (which I probably am!) this is a nice touch that IMO is a great addition.  There does seem to be a very small amount of distortion with the bass EQ, but I haven't noticed too much of a difference (though my ear may just not be trained yet).  Small warning though...This may not work great with all headphones.  I ordered both products (this and the headphones) at the same time, but for some reason the amp arrived a day before the cans.  So I decided to try this out with my Sennheiser CX500 in ear phones.  I did a few comparisons and to be honest the amp actually made some of them sound worse.  From what I've read I understand it has something to do with the ohm impedence of the cans...Again I'm new to this stuff.  So if you've got the ATH-M50 or ATH-M50S I would highly recommend this amp. Other than that you may want to be a little bit careful =)  Overall, I love the product!  Very very very glad that I purchased.
B004J4WV28|5.0|The Adrenaline 11 is the best investment I could have made towards my overall comfort and running performance.  I have extremely flat feet and am a mild pronator, I also have been suffering from a nagging ankle due to an injury suffered nearly a year ago.  The Adrenaline has provided the support and cushioning that I have been unable to find in any of the 6 other brands I have tried.  Thank you Brooks for putting out such an amazing product.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|yes this is just a trial version, BUT you get fifteen days and the program is very good.<br />I was past desperate today when trying to finish paperwork for my job. I had completed my work @ home on open office but my employer emailed me back unable to open it.<br />I tried the other free ap for docs, only to be frustrated because I couldn't edit or send out as an attachment unless I purchased their product. ugh. so I tried Kingsofts office, Yahoo!!!  it works beautifully.  I edited the docs, sent them out with ease.<br />I own a kindle fire, while I can use this trial version the app store says you can't get the full version on the fire yet. That's too bad because I'd buy it right now. this is an app that I need badly.
0446585025|3.0|I was very excited to get this book. I had never read her other books before. Some of her stuff was repeated, but if you don't get the watch every single show you get caught up.  It was still funny and I'll still watch her show. I do miss her dancing over the table this season.
0439023491|5.0|Oh my goodness. The first book was just the beginning of this amazing series. I literally could not put this book down and immediately got my hands on the third installment! Suzanne Collins makes this one so suspenseful and you really are shocked with some of the events that happen at the end. If I wasn't a fan already this book definitely made me one and I can not wait to read 'Mockingjay'. I gave The Hunger Games a 3/5, but little did I know that was just the beginning. This book is definitely a full-on 5/5!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good program, works as expected. Can be addictive, always looking for the next level. no problem loading or with the play, helps if you have played similar games.
0307454541|5.0|This book couldn't be a more appropriate metaphor for what is happening across the world at the time I read it. A Swedish financial journalist with actual morals dares to take on the corporate sleaze of his home country. When he loses a battle with one modern baron his life and company are spun out of control. During his social exile he is hired by the patriarch of a crumbling corporate family to investigate a forty year old murder case. What follows is cryptic study of a family with enough skeletons and secrets to threaten the lives of anyone who dares approach. Along the way the Journalist meets a young goth information junkie who finds his investigation to be a worthy challenge for her particular skills. The two of them tackle not only the murder case but also the largest financial scandal that Sweden has ever seen.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been made into a movie here in the States. If the movie stays true to the sentiments in the book, it will feel like a rally cry for anyone who is feeling disenfranchised by the current political/financial climate. It is truly a compelling work of fiction.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|It was midnight and my son and I had just finished watching The Deathly Hallows Part 1 on the BIG SCREEN. It was the first time we had ever done the midnight show on the opening night. After reading all the books, seeing all the preceding movies (multiple times) the build up to this finale was incredible. Would they get it right? Capture the intensity? The feeling? The danger? The answer is, absolutely.<br /><br />The movie exceeded all our expectations. It was very well done, the effects were incredible and the ending satisfying.<br /><br />I was happy to buy this three movie set. It comes with a Blu-ray copy, perfect for seeing all the great detail included in the movie, a DVD copy for when you are somewhere without a a Blu-ray player (like portable DVD's in the car). However, like other reviewers, I am greatly disappointed that the UV copy is not playable on my iPod or computer. I will be contacting Flixster for the iTunes download as another reviewer has suggested. Given this, I can't condemn the movie, just the content packing.<br /><br />A worthy ending to a fantastic series, but the UV copy will leave you dissatisfied.
B005MSD75U|5.0|This movie is a must see for anyone in need of a good laugh! Hands down one of the funniest movies of the year.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|On the surfaceDemolition Man seems to be a standard action flick set in the future. But it is really a satire on action movies, especially Stallone's and on society. Sandra Bullock, in her first staring role, steals the movie. She presents us with a character totally bored with her job as a police officer and full of bubbling enthusiasm , full-bore  optimism, and misquotes of 20th Century slang that provides the funniest parts of the movie. She is a joy to watch.  Stallone handles the comedy professionally and the action is appropriately over-the-top.  Only Galaxy Quest matches the fun and laughs of this movie.  The Blue-ray version has a sharp picture and adds DTS 5.1 surround sound.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray extended version... I think this is a great movie! Maybe the best \\"super-hero\\" movie so far. Great PQ and SQ, and the story isn't just one action sequence after another. I found this story compelling because it delved into the shared human struggle of fighting our own fear, controlling and ultimately mastering our fear and reaching deep to find the courage within each of us. I find THAT message most uplifting and worthy of my time. Thanks to all who gave me a most wonderful movie experience.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover is a \\"work of art\\"...really beautiful.  The cover fits tightly which I like since my Kindle DX cover is lose and the DX falls out, so I really like the protection of the tighter fit.  This works well for me and fits very nicely in my bag.
B002VCR03A|3.0|I would opt for 3.5 stars for this one if I could.  The story line was intriguing and I liked the energy of the main characters.  There were some loose ends for me that should have been tied up.  Katsa, should have had some closure with her King especially given the way they parted company.  In my honest opinion, Raffin seems gay (sorry just sayin). Ok, Katsa is the better fighter and all but she has abusive tendencies and Po seemed very much a victim at times which I guess makes it ok that marriage was a question sign.  I wasn't happy with how it ended though.  Things seemed to have worked out for all the characters how we wanted to except for the final step for Katsa and Po.  I mean, come on, would it have been so bad if they did make it legal?

B003P2WO5E|5.0|It drew me in from the first chapter. Was a little worried after trying Alloy of Law (a sad attempt to continue the Mistborn series when the Trilogy as it ended was perfect as it was), but this completely restored my faith in Sanderson. The characters were believable, human and compelling. The story unfolded slowly, but with great pacing. Every chapter revealed something new and kept me turning the page. A little bit of a throwback to the various allomantic capabilities from the Mistborn series  (precious gems this time instead of metal?), but all in all, an amazing new world to get excited about and a great story line to unfold over the next books in the series.  Highly recommended!

B00422LESO|2.0|Thankfully, I purchased this when it was the Kindle Daily Deal so didn't waste too much money on it.  The premise for the plot is clever and I think another author could have successfully executed a wonderfully clever, witty, and romantic story.  Instead what you will find in \\"Austenland\\" is a 32 year old female protagonist who loves to feel sorry for herself in terms of her love life and deludes herself into thinking that her ideal of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the reason that her relationships fail.  I did like that the author breaks up the chapters by giving you a one page synopsis of each relationship, which begins with Jane being a young teenager.  It becomes clear that Jane's problem isn't an obsession with Mr. Darcy, but rather that she lets herself fall for jerks and losers.  She arrives in \\"Austenland\\" determined to live out her Mr. Darcy fantasy so that she'll purge herself of it forever.  But then she precedes to feel foolish and cannot commit to the emersion experience.  She makes out with a gardener and ultimately fancies that she's grown into a truely liberated woman because she can except that it's just a fling and not lose her heart; meanwhile, she's still continuing her pattern of letting men choose her and not taking any time to vet the men she spends time with.  While I did like the character clearly designed to immitate Mr. Darcy, the ending was utterly ridiculous.  I felt that there was no character growth from Jane; she just finally lucked out and met her prince charming.<br />Finally, the most frustrating part of this book was that the author pushes Jane's supposed moments of self-awareness and growth down your throat.  There's no subtle unfolding through conversation and actions; this author wants you to blatantly understand that this moment is where Jane realizes x, y, and z about herself and has such and such psychological break-through.  Overall, this story just lacked finesse, wit, and charm; and I felt no connection with the main character at all.<br />I'm giving it 2 points for the originality of the plot idea, but there are a lot of Pride and Prejudice spin-offs and knock-offs.  This isn't a good one; so, don't bother.ection with the main character at all.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen so far! There wasn't any chemistry between Rochester and Jane. She was a cold fish compared to what one imagines her character to be when reading the book. The only redeeming aspect was the scenery in this movie. Otherwise I would say it was a total flop!

B00030DEQE|5.0|Bought this for my Dell XPS 7100 that had onboard Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet that was not working well with Win7 all of a sudden, it was taking 1-2 min. to connect by cable.  Because of Dell's limited slots, I had only 1 PCI slot left, and it was a bear getting this card seated because my video card was flush against it. When it finally did seat, it worked 1st time and Windows installed a driver.<br />Wanting to update the driver, I went to Intel's site and tried to use their software to detect the card, but it didn't work well at all (as a matter of fact, it caused my computer to crash with a blue screen and memory dump 3 times, and since I have a dual boot system, I tried it there with the same results) and for this particular card, it appears they haven't updated it for a long time and I couldn't find it listed on their website.<br />I use DriverMax to keep all my drivers up-to-date, it's free and you can download 2 drivers per day, but you must do your homework cuz they don't always have the EXACT driver you need, sometimes its close but thankfully their rollback feature works well.  I also use [...] (also free, but don't use the MediaGet feature cuz it installs a program for downloading torrents) for some drivers that I feel DriverMax doesn't always get right, but they don't always get the latest drivers for a few weeks. Case in point: I have a PCi 3.0 USB card by Iomega for extra ports and bought 2 external USB 3.0 storage drives.  DriverMax has the correct driver for it, but because of the way it installs using their software, it does not always work correctly, but usually X-Driver.com will get the driver from Renesas 2-3 weeks later and it installs flawlessly.<br />Well, anyway, back to the Intel driver, DriverMax had an update (V 8.3.15.0), but I checked with x-drivers.com, and they had a completely different set of drivers for the Gbe or PRO 1000, but not the GT specifically.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has a way of walking me along side his characters. His words know exactly how create the perfect movie in my mind.

B005LZW8FO|1.0|I saw the promo for this on another movie. I was so excited that it would be a neat movie and fun to watch as well as thoughtful.<br /><br />The whole story could be be changed to a winning lottery ticket. The Earth 2 really does not play into the story except as this ideal that there is another me.<br /><br />The movie is slow and tedious and I kept waiting for the encounter with Earth2. I kept waiting and waiting for the movie to get going. I paused the movie at about an 1:15 and saw only 15 minutes left. Disappointment. The movie does not get going.<br /><br />On the positive side: I think this says something about how justice and recitation to make a person whole after a crime should work.<br /><br />Outside of that, if there is another me out there? DO NOT WASTE 90 minutes of your life.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.<br /><br />We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.<br /><br />First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.<br /><br />Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.<br /><br />Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.<br /><br />But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.<br /><br />This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.<br /><br />A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.<br /><br />But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their naïve feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.<br /><br />At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.<br /><br />The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.<br /><br />I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVEtes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their naïve feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.  At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant.

1451627289|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. I LOVED this. It IS Long. It IS worth it. I loved it from the captivating beginning to the magical ending. I really hope they make a movie out of this book. And if they do, I hope they cast Leo DiCaprio in the lead. Great book!
0345522478|5.0|Ever since Jim Butcher and urban fantasy became the latest \\"big thing\\" various publishers have been falling all over themselves to tap into the market.  I was a little skeptical when I was reading the back of the book but ultimately I wasn't disappointed at all.  True Atticus O'Sullivan isn't a Wizard per say but he is a Druid which is the next best thing.  An extremely interesting first entry with some moments on the part of Atticus's dog that made me laugh out loud.  If you like this kind of writing and know what you are getting into I highly recommend it.

0307593312|1.0|I found the story and the characters to be very trite.  I couldn't be bothered reading much beyond the second set of lovely breasts.  Characterization of the women involved trite sexual generalizations (both slender, both had well shaped breasts, blah blah blah. Little lesbian action recalled from when one character was young that did nothing to enrich character development or the plot). The men were saved from the sexual details but were no more interesting.  It had all the thrill and challenge of a third rate bodice ripper.<br /><br />I donated the book to the local library.<br /><br />The only reason there is a single star is that Amazon would not allow me to leave the stars blank.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I received this adorable little beanie baby as part of a secret santa gift. From what I was told, it was sent quickly, and was shipped from Australia, so that is a huge plus! This plushie is about 6 or so inches tall, but the head is much larger than the body and very cuddly, making it so cute! This is definitely something a child, or someone who LOVES hello kitty would love to have! The dress is sewn right onto the body, so no chance of it coming off, although with enough tugging the bow might loosen a bit. It is still overall so adorable and very kid friendly I have to say. A great piece for any hello kitty fan! And you can't beat the price!

B005KAH7QU|5.0|\\"Hanna\\" is simply a great movie. In today's world where teenage girls grow up in a society obsessed with excessive makeup and fashion, reality TV, Hollywood, and all things shallow and superficial, a thriller like Hanna where the two main characters are tough, fearless, intelligent women is a breath of fresh air that should be praised as a film supporting female empowerment!<br /><br />Hanna is a teenage girl who was raised in an arctic environment secluded from human contact except for her father (Eric Bana, who delivers a very restrained and nuanced performance. Why doesn't he have an Oscar yet?!). Her father is an ex-CIA agent who has trained her in hand-to-hand combat, honed her skills at archery, and taught her every tactic necessary to be totally self-reliant, while also developing her physical fitness to a superb level. Talk about a good role model for young girls today-- Hanna is strong, smart, and able to defend herself. There are way too many creeps out there looking to prey on young girls. Not our Hanna though... she could eat a child predator for lunch. Awesome characterization and an awesome performance from Saiorse Ronan. She captivated me throughout the film. I didn't want to take my eyes off her. She is eventually taken into custody by CIA agents who appear friendly and just want some answers, however the palpable tension makes us believe they clearly have a hidden agenda.<br /><br />This brings us to another strong -- yet decidedly malevolent -- female presence on screen. Cate Blanchett plays a cunning CIA agent who desparately pursues Hanna throughout the film. Apparently she used to work with Hanna's father at the CIA.<br />The plot takes off from there, and I must say it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. There are moments of humor and tenderness, and although some characters' motives and plot involvement are left a little messy, the film comes to a surprising and fulfilling conclusion. \\"Wow\\" was the only thing I could say, and the film stayed with me for the next few days. I found myself walking around wishing I was as badass and confident as Hanna!<br /><br />This is a must-see for teenage girls and anyone who enjoys fast-paced action as well as some deep, intriguing characters. A+++next few days. I found myself walking around wishing I was as badass and confident as Hanna!

B0056BU3I2|5.0|Fast Five is easily the best of the F&TF series, bringing back almost the entire original cast with an all new storyline, featuring our anti-heroes Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster as wanted criminals in the middle of Central America, and Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and the rest of his crew seeking them out. What makes this movie different from all the others is that the cars are actually NOT the stars of the film. No, this one puts the characters in the forefront, and does so with enough heart-pumping action to keep you invigorated throughout the entire film, including it's teaser ending that feature a cameo by an actress from the 2nd F&F movie, not to mention also hinting at another sequel in a cute and creative way.   Everything from the films fast-paced action, brilliant editing, and ear-blasting sound mix make for one of the better action movies to be released in the last 5 to 10 years (sadly, the gun-toting action guy-movie genre has been in very minimal demand due to a stupid influx of cheesy redundant romantic comedies, recycled CGI kids movies and hippie stoner flicks that continuously have been released in the last decade). With a little more of an edge, Fast Five could have easily hit an R-rating, therefore making this one at the borderline PG-13 area, similar to The Dark Knight.   The great part about characterization is that, unlike the first film, the two can't really be compared, thus leaving this one completely independent in and of itself, and some of the action is so intense and well choreographed, with completely minimal use of CGI (thank God!) so everything simply feels more real and intense, despite that lots of it is pretty far-fetched. But just like those old exciting 80's and 90's guy flicks, we don't watch them for their realism.   What's an extra added bonus is that with this package we get the theatrical and extended edition (granted the extended is only about 1 minute longer), and a digital copy where you can also put the extrabonus features as well as the feature presentation.   That said, this one's highly recommended, easily.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|For those of you who like long, track-by-track reviews, please skip.  (Others will do a great job at that, so I won't duplicate effort here.)<br /><br />I've been listening to this album all-day at work and I am just as impressed with it as I was 'Endgame'.  I don't know how these all-over-40 guys manage to groove and rock so damn-hard, but thank the gods-of-metal that they do!<br /><br />If you liked 'Endgame' and/or every Megadeth album post-'Risk', you'll dig this album.  Put yo' weight on it!!

0439023513|5.0|This final book of the Hunger Games series was very good. I really enjoyed how she ended this book/series.  This series was very intense and I don't think I will be watching the movie.  My imagination is vivid enough, I don't need to see the pictures on-screen. These books were geared for young adults but very thought provoking for all ages. I hope you enjoy this book the final chapter of the Hunger Games series as much as I did.

031617615X|1.0|I'm prefacing that I don't like love story novels.  I read these books because one day I was really bored and broke down and saw the Twilight movie... and I had to know how (not if, because dear God these stories are so predictable) she got to be a vampire.    Also, even though these novels do not touch the creativity and genius of JRR Tolkien and Rowling, I did find the different take on vampires drinking animal blood (although the glittering in the light made me want to gag) and I thought the Volturi was a pretty cool idea too.  I literally read these books for the sci-fi/fantasy aspect of them.  Big fat fail on my part.  Firstly, if it was even possible... Bella got more annoying in each novel.  When it was Jacob narrating in Breaking Dawn, it truly was a breath of fresh air.  I LOVED his part.  I then thought to myself \\"why the heck didn't Meyers just write from Jacob's point of view the entire time?\\".  I really never hated a narrator/protagonist so much before.  Nevermind that though.  **spoiler alert**  The ending.  Oh, the ending.  It was awful.  You're telling me that in the first 3 novels building up to the Volturi showdown...which I was seriously excited for... that it came to be one big stare down?  Really?? I mean, REALLY??? I know Meyers is a Mormon stay-at-home wife, but even Eclipse had more action than BD.  This alone makes me tell people do not spend your time on this series.  I felt almost insulted.  As if in the end, Meyers got lazy and wanted to tie everything up into a nice, pretty bow.  Lets not even dive into the absolute creepiness of how Jacob imprints on the baby.  Honestly though, I've read some bad books in my day... but I have never ever wanted to chuck a book before until I read the ending (climax) of this book. Thankfully, these books are fast reads and didn't take up a whole lot of my time.  However, I'm sure if you're reading this you likely have read the first 3... then by all means you might as well finish it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  There's much better sci-fi/fantasy books than these (and yes, I did go into it with that attitude, I just wanted to be entertained with fluff)... and even better romance books if that's what you're into.  When I have kids, I'll let them read it... but they better follow up with books that have substance.  Just my opinion though.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Item works as described. Provides excellent FM transmitted sound quality similar to CD with minimal or no FM noise depending on frequency chosen. The Aux output provides even better sound quality. Ths is my 2nd unit since my wife after discovering how good it is claimed my 1st unit! My first unit was the one w/o the Aux output and it too is excellent.
B0043URV5U|2.0|It replaces the 2-disc \\"Greatest Hits\\" from ten or so years ago, but other songs are missing that would make this a complete collection.  First off, the best \\"Fire\\" song that Seger wrote, \\"The Fire Inside,\\" is not here, nor are \\"C'est la Vie\\" or \\"Rosalie.\\"  The collection seems to aim towards radio listeners only, or people who only want one CD of Seger's music (even though he just re-released \\"Live Bullet.\\")  However, I remember hearing \\"The Fire Inside\\" every single day in the afternoon in the car when it was new, and can actually recite several of the lyrics and the hook after not having heard it for a few years now.<br /><br />That said, why is \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\" even here at all?  Recorded in 1968, it sounds very out of place given the gloss of the late-70s/early 80s material.  If you've ever heard the album \\"Smokin' OP's,\\" you know what I mean, as that album, cut in 1972, includes a grainy sounding track, 'Heavy Music,\\" recorded in 1966.  There, \\"Heavy Music\\" sounds out of place.  Here, \\"Ramblin'\\" sounds out of place, as it sounds like a) another artist, and b) nothing else on the collection, as far as sound quality and production are concerned (perhaps they should take the tracks and alter the production to sound \\"current,\\" like ZZ Top did with their entire discography?)<br /><br />Really, what is needed is a \\"1968-1974\\" collection (even if it only sells 50,000 copies), as this collection covers the rest in an incomplete but nearly acceptable way.  Right now, Seger's actual best material cannot be easily acquired by interested listeners.  Unfortunately, \\"Early Seger Vol. 1\\" attempted to cover that concept, but half of the tracks were recorded in the 80s - which means, if it is ever released, \\"Early Seger Vol. 2\\" will also be incomplete and will need to be coupled with Vol. 1, and it will also likely have more \\"unreleased 80s tracks.\\" I wouldn't personally consider recordings Seger cut after age 40 as \\"Early,\\" as that was the age that marked his successful period.<br /><br />Who is in control of Seger's catalog?  Whomever it is, it's in disarray, and that doesn't appear as if it will be rectified.  Capitol refusing to re-release some of its artists' best recordings from the artist's \\"developmental\\" phase (Seger, Steve Miller, etc.) is a travesty.<br /><br />Also, will we ever get the studio version of \\"Lookin Back,\\" which was always considered one of Seger's most crucial lyrics?  Fans, by now, realize that Seger, Capitol, and Punch are not fans of his first seven or eight albums, or any singles that preceded \\"Hollywood Nights.\\"  Sure, this music has made millions and can be heard every day.  Apparently, all we'll get from Seger from here on out, barring a \\"new\\" studio album or a \\"live\\" collection from the 2011 tour (likely) are more hits re-releases containing the same material, or patchworks of eras.  I'm surprised people are still spending money on the retreads.  Such is life, though (e.g. remaster the same 20 cuts every five years, release the same album as \\"remastered,\\" and sit back and cash the checks as the public flocks to the same recordings and concepts of old.)<br /><br />Idea: why not release the albums with 10 extra tracks each, recorded from the actual era the album was cut, like the Rolling Stones?  You have to admit that the Stones' expanded versions of \\"Exile\\" and \\"Some Girls,\\" while not the equals of the original albums, are worth the purchase for true fans and casuals alike (true fans get extras, casual fans get what they wanted, remastered.)<br /><br />No such brightness on the Seger horizon, though, and I'd personally prefer expanded versions of the first eight or so albums than an expanded \\"Night Moves,\\" which is what we'd likely get if Capitol went down this road.
B0042MDAL8|1.0|Be careful ordering this BluRay title. If it says sold by anyone other than Amazon you are probably going to get a foreign made BluRay disc like I did, not the product described in the listing / pictured. Amazon was good about returning the BluRay since it wasnt what was pictured but since it was a gift I didnt appreciate having to run around locally at the last minute to try and find the correct BluRay I wanted. Clear case of bait and switch. Buyer beware.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I've tried several other applications for Google Reader (e.g. EasyRSS, JustReader) on the Kindle Fire, and this one is the first one that has me not going back to the web interface.  It runs pretty fast, has support for offline reading (haven't tried this out yet), and most importantly for me, it has sort by oldest to newest.  All in all, well worth the (free) price.  In fact, I hope the author plans on getting the Pro version in the store.  I'd be willing to pay to get rid of the ads, even though they are not really obtrusive.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was looking for a pair of headphones like these for the longest time. I was having trouble with the solely \\"in ear\\" ones that are the most popular form of headphones these days. When I went on longer runs those would just fall out from sweat or wind and it was irritating. These are PERFECT and the cost is unbeatable! They are comfortable and manage to stay on during my entire run! I'm very impressed!
B005IS565S|2.0|Ive been a fan of this band since the beginning and I was a fan of Motograter when Moody was on vocals. But this album sounds really bad. The drums and guitar are way to compressed and processed to the point that it all sounds fake. I like alot of the songs on here,but i cant get past the poorly engineered work that was done on this album. FFDP hopefully gets this too and will get other people to work their next album with them. Its a shame because these are really good songs.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I was a little disappointed initially, BUT after two weeks and filling it with my FIRE, touch-pen, ear buds & a large cleaning cloth, I have found it to be nearly perfect for me. Sure, it could have an external pocket to hold that stuff, but then it would have more bulk and not fit as easily into a large pocket, purse, etc. I like the leather strap that makes a nice hand grab, preventing accidental drops. It is a tight fit for the FIRE, especially with a pen, ear buds, and cleaning cloth, but I don't worry. The zipper is strong and there doesn't seem to be too much stress on the zipper or the FIRE. I keep the pen attached to the ear phone jack, letting the pen lie at the bottom of the cover when packing. It seems to stay there well, not going on top or behind the FIRE. The buds fit behind the FIRE to keep them from being atop the screen. I put the cleaning cloth on top of the screen. BTW, I find the screen to the FIRE to be very strong and resilient as it has been reviewed to be elsewhere.  I would agree that the prices on this and other sleeves are way higher than what seems consistent with materials and quality. As far as the smell goes, mine is ok after 2 wis. I am concerned about that if the claim another revised made indicates possible use of toxic materials.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I get that Lou Reed is a legend. But why on earth would he choose Metallica to be the band backing this album? Their styles dont even come close to each other. Id ask why Metallica would ever consider doing an album with Lou Reed, But as we all (or at least most of us) know, Metallica are notorious for making really bad decisions. And this is probably the worst decision they have ever made. This is not the way to follow up Death Magnetic. The momentum and excitement that was built up from that album has probably been destroyed by this. I really hope I am wrong about that.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|Frank Darabont directed this adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Does it have lots of horror movie cliches? Yes. Are the monsters both scary and a bit silly? Of course. Are the special effects believable? Quite.  Generally speaking, I've been a fan of King's non-monsterific works, like \\"Misery\\" and \\"Delores Clayborne\\", but I haven't enjoyed most of his horror books (my least favorite being \\"Christine\\").  When adapted to film, I've enjoyed them even less, with a few exceptions. \\"The Mist\\" is one of them.  I thought the book was better than average, but the movie seriously improved on the book.   So, what sets this movie apart from inferior adaptations, like \\"Christine\\" or \\"The Tommyknockers\\"? First, I thought the characters were better drawn and [generally] acted more as real people would in an unbelievable situation. Second, while the beasties were peculiar and horrifying, they didn't seem like caricatures, like Christine, or ill-conceived concepts, like the Tommyknockers. Third, Frank Darabont is quite good at putting characters in menacing situations, and getting the audience to feel it (just watch \\"The Walking Dead\\" for a great example). Last, the ending. It was unexpected, non-Hollywood, and was much better than the end in the book.  I just got the Blu Ray, which includes a black and white version of The Mist.  This is how Frank Darabont conceived of The Mist from the beginning, and the movie seems perfectly suited for a black and white presentation.  I think it's time I watched it.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|With this release, What I was hoping for was a little bit of change. Not so much in musical style, but subject matter.  Track 1 - This Means War - 4 Stars - This song has a great guitar riff and should be a part of their live show.  Track 2 - Bottoms Up - 3 Stars - Good rocking music with lyrics about drinking. This is what i mean by subject matter change.  Track 3 - When We Stand Together - 4 Stars - This is one of my favorites. Its contemporary, but this song has a really good message.  Track 4 - Midnight Queen - 3 Stars - Im not too sure what the story of this song is. All I know is its a song about drinking and sex. What else is new,right?  Track 5 - Gotta Get Me Some - 4 Stars - This song has an awesome groove,Would have recieved 5 stars if it wasn't about...Wait For It.... Drinking and Sex.  Track 6 - Lullaby - 5 Stars - Another contemporary song. This song is special to me because it hit pretty close to home for me. A very well written song.  Track 7 - Kiss It Goodbye - 4 Stars - Probably my Favorite Rocker on this album.  Track 8 - Trying Not To Love You - 3 Stars - Break up song. This song sounds similar to other songs they have done in the past couple albums.  Track 9 - Holding On To Heaven - 3 stars - Love Song. Once again,This song sounds similar to other songs on the past couple albums.  Track 10 - Everything I Wanna Do - 3 stars - A song about a girlfriend who will do anything you wanna do in bed.  Track 11 - Don't Ever Let It End - 1 Star - Another song along the lines of \\"This Afternoon\\" on the Dark Horse Album. Not a fan at all of this Song.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Granted, the first track is a total train-wreck, and can ruin the entire album for you if you don't give it a chance beyond that. I almost didn't, but am glad I did. Everything beyond the first track is awesome. The View, and Cheat on Me are my two favorite songs on the album so far, but the rest are growing on me. If you go in with lowered expectations, and realize this is more of a Lou Reed cross-over album than a full Metallica album, it really is great.  St. Anger had a similar thing for me. It was pretty much critically panned. But when you actually listen to it, and give it a chance, you realize it's a really solid album with many good songs.   I was a fan of Lou Reed before, but this just solidified it. Great album. Besides, how can you not love singing along and screaming \\"I am the table!\\"? Greatness.

More pictures than you can count and great descriptions of heroes and villains that are not too long. If you want a book that tells you something about practically every character to ever appear in a Marvel comic then this book is for you.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Initially, I really wasn't fond of this cover.  Then my Kindle was stolen & I had to replace it & the cover.  (Thanks, AmEx for the purchase protection!!!)  I reviewed all of the products available & wound up buying this one again.  It provides great protection.  I've dropped it countless times & the cover & my kindle show no signs of abuse.  I didn't want a cover I had to zip the kindle in & out of, I don't know what good that would do vs. this cover.<br /><br />When I get into a book, I find myself turning it over, as if I was turning pages in a book.  I just finished reading a paperback book & found that it was more inconvenient than reading on my kindle in this cover.<br /><br />Just don't plan on using it as an easel, you might be able to set it up to read, but I haven't gotten it to stay up for touchscreen apps.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The first 5 minutes of this film are absolutely breathtaking, and it only took that long for me to completely fall in love with it.  I love Woody Allen, Paris, and 1920's art and literature, so maybe I'm a little bias.  Still, I would have to assume that anyone who watches this will enjoy it.  It has a really inspiring message that personally made me excited to live in the moment and pursue my passions.  It also made me want to fly back to Paris, immediately.  I saw it in theaters twice, and am so excited it's finally out on DVD!
0446547603|4.0|I really liked this story. It moved along at a great pace, I grew fond of the characters and liked the ending very much. Some of his other books have been too predictable in recent years. Safe Haven is my favorite Sparks novel!!!

1461190460|2.0|I know this is small, but it's something that really bothered me and might bother others.  While the content is all fine in the paperback edition, the cover pages are terrible.  The art is completely pixelated and it looks absolutely terrible.  Actually, even the art inside looks simply like it was copied and pasted into a Word document, and they are somewhat pixelated and have a strange almost gray background.
143352869X|5.0|Though I've loved my Quest NIV Study Bible for ages, I found I was wanting something a little bit \\"more\\" - and that's what this ESV Study Bible is...MORE!!  I find the introductions to the books with the outlines and color maps to be delightful to read before diving in to my bible study.  The footnotes are easy to understand and apply.  I am THRILLED with the layout and appreciate very much the obvious effort that went into making this a treasured tool to aid in bible study.  I look forward to using it for many years. And, as an added bonus, the TruTone Brown/Purple, Iris design version has a beautiful cover. It is discretely, but definitely feminine. I must say, the picture you see when ordering does not do the book justice at all!! Purchase with confidence!
B000KIPT30|5.0|besides the fact that it must always be plugged in, the build and sound quality are awesome. it only has 1/4 inch jacks so you need to get adaptors for 3.5mm though
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Ok, you have to have a specific fondness for cult classic movies and gore/horror to like this movie but if you DO like movies like that, you will love this movie. Lets be honest. It IS toilet humor and it's for people that just want a good laugh.<br />Tucker and Dale at first are mistaken (by college kids) for psycho hillbillie rednecks. We soon see they are just 2 friends that just want their PBR and to go fishing. The kids are so paranoid of Tucker and Dale that, they end up killing their own friends. Gruesome deaths galore here folks.<br />It is a hilarious spoof on the horror genre and people who stereotype others.<br />BEES!!!!! (look up the trailer)<br />Well made, and fun to watch.
145551389X|5.0|Gaga wrote something special about Terry at the beginning but after that there are really no words in this amazing picture book. I felt as if I really got to know her by looking into her life on the rode and at home. Everything from her sleeping to her giving a speech at a gay rights rally! It's all captured And it's all beautiful. Lady Gaga has made art with her music and on stage during her performances and now there is art being made in her name by looking at all of these beautiful one of a kind pictures of her. This book gave out me in an entirely new level of love for her that I didnt think was possible to be on! Paws up forever fellow Little Monsters! Everybody should own this book!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This CPU Cooler brought my idle operating temp from 42c to 25c!!! Nearly a 20c drop in temperature. I ordered another 120mm fan which i would suggest you do since this cpu cooler was designed for optimal effectiveness with two of them. even under a 100% full load with video editing and conversion, my amd quad core 3.4ghz black edition doesnt get above 38c! definitely will not build another system without this cpu cooler. hands down the best one i have ever owned. I have been building and working on computers for a little over 12 years and i have to say that the installation was not really easy. read the instructions first is all i can say. read them thoroughly.

0525422943|4.0|Sequel to If I Stay, narrated by Adam, is chock full of the same kind of emotional resonance that made the first book so moving.   It's been three years since the accident that killed Mia's family and left her with life-threatening injuries. Mia is done with college and ready to start a world tour. Adam is now a celebrated rockstar who uses pills and alcohol to make it through one day at a time.   Ever since Mia cut off contact with him, he has felt hurt and angry. Ironically, those emotions are exactly what fueled his songwriting to become a hit album, Collateral Damage. Adam is a stranger in his own life. After he loses it with a reporter, he gets the okay to take the rest of the day to chill before catching a plane to London the next day to start a tour with his band, Shooting Star. While wandering around New York City, Adam stumbles across a theater where Mia is playing a concert and decides to stay and watch.   After the show, Mia invites Adam to come along as she says goodbye to her favorite spots in the city. Keep the kleenex handy as Mia and Adam reconnect and search for acceptance in the aftermath of unspeakable tragedy.

0307888681|5.0|I'm actually a bit of a history buff. I wasn't always this way. In high school, history meant a lot of memorizing: dates, names, places, etc. BORING! But I discovered in college (with the help of a great professor) that history can be interesting. Really. History is really just old gossip. The more things change, the more they stay the same and I find it very interesting to imagine myself living in a time such as Henry VIII's England, Cleopatra's Egypt, World War II Era U.S. or...living through the Zombie War.  One of my favorite ways to learn about to good ol' days is through the genre of oral histories. Basically, oral histories are a collection of people's stories as told by them. The cool thing for me is that this device helps me feel more immersed in the time period. Regular people seem to talk about little details and feelings that your typical history book won't touch (they're too worried about dates, names, places, you know...the boring stuff.)  Anywhoo...back to the review at hand. Max Brooks has subtitled World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War. The book is put together as an organized collection of various survivors' recollections of the Zombie War. About two stories in, I found myself engrossed and actually believing we did survive a near-apocalypse. The entire tone of the book is so detailed and realistic that I no longer felt that I was reading (listening) to a fictional tale, but rather reliving a real-life event. Quite a feat for a novel about zombies.  I actually listened to World War Z as an audio book on Audible and really, I'm not sure I would have it any other way. The tale is narrated by multiple actors including: Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker) , Rob Reiner, Alan Alda and Carl Reiner. The cast is amazing and the audio version has been nominated and won several awards. Mark Hamill's portrayal of seasoned soldier, Todd Wainio, was particularly impressive.  This is the first novel is several months that I want to re-read already (think I'm going to buy the hardcover for that) because I enjoyed it that much.  Max Brooks is also the author of The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection From the Living Dead and given my love of zombies and my love for World War Z, I'm pretty sure I want Mr. Brooks to be my new BFF.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I've taken to listening to Pandora while working the day away. When I replaced my iPhone with a DroidX smartphone last year I was extremely disappointed to find the audio quality lacking to say the least.<br /><br />An audiophile coworker suggested I replace my aging $15 headphones. There was no way I was going to drop the coin to create a setup like his, so after much searching I found the $50 [[ASIN:B0002D03ZW Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones]]. He warned me that my little smartphone was not going to drive them, so I went back to Amazon and came up with the FiiO E5. I figured for $20 I couldn't lose, and I didn't!<br /><br />For $70 I now have a listening experience that blows my old setup out of the water! I don't like my music overly loud, rather with a clean, dynamic sort of quality. I can actually hear details in my music with this setup. I would recommend the E5 to anyone who's not sold on the idea of dropping more than $20 on a pair of headphones. Spend the extra few bucks, and you'll be glad you did. This thing is solidly built, and a great value for the money. After a year of every day use, this thing hasn't even hiccupped!
014241543X|5.0|Wow. Just wow.  If you haven't read If I Stay yet, you need to drop everything and pick it up. It's the touching, mesmerizing, tragic and hopeful tale of Mia, her family, boyfriend and friends. If I Stay starts with a tragedy pretty early on, but through flashbacks, we are allowed to learn more about Mia's family and friends. I love the way each scene is doled out, bit by bit.   The way Foreman intersperses the flashbacks among the real-time heartache, makes each scene that much more poignant. If I Stay is just as much a story of the bonds of family and the awkwardness and promise of a first love.   The scenes with Mia and her boyfriend, Adam, are well-written and ring true to life. The way they are shy and a little weird with each other, at first, is the way I remember my first relationship to be, not \\"sweep me off my feet and run of into the sunset with scripted snarky words,\\" but with timid, getting to know each other, tenderness.  If I Stay is a tear-jerker, to be sure, so keep your hankies handy. However, I wouldn't call it a sob-fest and didn't feel the need to call the suicide hotline at the end.   I love the question Foreman poses: if we could choose to stay, would we, knowing the heartbreak and loss that would lie ahead? I can't wait to read the sequel Where She Went to see how Mia handles the consequences of her decision.
B005K17RU0|4.0|good app.  occasionally crashes on the kindle fire.  very versatile, and has been as accurate as any local weatherman in my experience.
B00004XONN|5.0|Three smooth electric piano chords, the muted thuds of a bass drum and frontman Thom Yorke's glitchy, KORG-manipulated vocals comprise the first :20 of \\"Everything in Its Right Place.\\" It's a twenty seconds I wish I could hear over and over again for the first time. Listening to Kid A for the first time is the gentle rumble of a paradigm shift. Writing eleven years in the wake of its release, it is easy to see how this seminal record has influenced subsequent music. In '65 the Beatles released Rubber Soul, an album that hybridized the best existing pop forms, from rockabilly to folk to balladry while exploring new themes in rock music; the next year they put out Revolver, a gleaming psychedelic document that sounded unlike what had come before. Radiohead's career trajectory follows a similar arc; 1997's OK Computer suggested innovation at every turn but Kid A effectively redefined the idiom of popular music. Its masterful synthesis of electronic computer music and alternative rock styles makes Kid A a watershed album.   But I digress. Adulation over Kid A's importance is useless without starting at the beginning. In the late `90s, Radiohead songwriter and creative genius Thom Yorke was becoming bored with what he saw as the trappings of \\"alternative\\" music. A fan of techno music, Yorke had been a DJ in college before starting Radiohead. In the wake of OK Computer's success, he started listening to electronic music almost exclusively. Yorke was listening heavily to contemporary groups like Autechre and Aphex Twin as well as `70s Krautrock groups like Can and Kraftwerk. By listening to the former, Yorke and Co. were exposed to the nascent electronic music scene. They began incorporating the associated musical techniques into their music, experimenting with the software synthesizers utilized by Aphex Twin (Johnny Greenwood and other members had already been using Moog synthesizers for some time) and becoming proficient with samplers. Can and Kraftwerk were an early inspiration for the type of electronic music that Radiohead wanted to create. Many of Kraftwerk's early innovations are used in different forms, from electronic drumkits to the music sequencer used by the band on the album Trans Europe Express. Radiohead's appreciation for both of these groups is evident; the band covered Can's \\"The Thief\\" and invited Kraftwerk to open for them in 2009.   Yorke's push toward electronic music was greeted at first with tension from other band members. Part of the reason was the redefinition of roles inherent in the musical shift. As a band with three guitar players, a drummer and a bassist, the instrumentation of the band was traditional rock. With this new phase, members of the band had to adapt and bring in new instruments that would fit the electronic sphere. Bassist Colin Greenwood became proficient with samplers. A quick aside: \\"Idioteque\\" track 8 on the album features a sample from Paul Lansky. Lansky, a student of Milton Babbitt is a professor of music at Princeton University known for his developments in computer music languages and algorithmic composition and a sample from his piece \\"Mild und Leise\\" serves as the harmonic background for \\"Idioteque.\\" Guitarist Ed O'Brien learned more about straight-ahead computer music and the computer languages pioneered by Max Matthews. Drummer Phil Selway was forced to incorporate electronic percussion into his repertoire and because well-versed in the operation of drum machines. And like George Harrison with the sitar or Brian Wilson with the theremin, lead guitar player Johnny Greenwood picked up the Ondes Martenot for the first time on Kid A using it on several tracks and introducing it to an audience who had no idea of its existence.  This last point is what truly crystallizes the beauty and importance of Kid A. Radiohead's experimentation with electronic music was substantial in its effect on their output; without the unifying element of Yorke's wistful falsetto, Kid A is virtually unrecognizable from the band's early `90s work. It embraces new genres, new techniques, and new forms. More important is the fact that the music actually works. The chopped drum beats and warped vocals on the title track to the ambient synth-generated soundscapes on \\"In Limbo\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" to the sprawling Ondes breaks on \\"How to Disappear Completely,\\" support change and support the fact that the band's shift has led to new heights. Released in the first year of a new millennium, Kid A is a blueprint for sonic rediscovery and evolution. Musicians of the 21st century, take up thy laptops and walk.

B005HS00NW|4.0|Note to Reader: This review was written as part of an assignment in a college course on the history and composition of technosonic music.   M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, is a fantastic album that is easy to get lost in. It is overflowing with cascading synthesizers, transporting you to an 80s synth dreamland. The album is pleasant and provides a sense of bliss in its beauty.   The album begins with three epic songs in the \\"Intro\\", \\"Midnight City\\", and \\"Reunion\\". However, the album fails to match that level excitement anywhere else. Yet it stands out in other places from the beauty of the arrangement. Take the background piano on \\"Splendor\\" or the acoustic guitar intro on \\"Soon, My Friend\\"; the beauty of \\"Wait\\", flutes on \\"New Map\\"; even the child excited about frogs on \\"Raconte-moi une histoire\\". Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is an album that stands out more from the mellower, more beautiful tracks in the cracks of the album between the synth-pounding epics. Although, the album's length can wear on the listener. Being a double album, there is a sense of \\"didn't I hear this same song before.\\" But each track is so well constructed that this flaw is bearable.  In the context of the class (Technosonics at the University of Virginia), Hurry Up, We're Dreaming serves as a stark contrast to the artists highlighted this semester. Most of the artists covered so far in this class have been experimental in nature. This includes people working on the basics of electronic music, playing around with computers and noise for the first time. From sampling tape music, frequency modulators, computerized voices, granular synthesis, phasing, and other various effects, these artists tried to push the boundaries on what is considered \\"music.\\" Whereas M83 focus on creating something simply enjoyable. Here, those basics have been established. There is no struggle to redefine what music is. Instead, M83 refine their sound, while also adding various other instruments to enhance it.  What standsout to me is how simple it is to listen to. The Technosonics course portrays electronic music as experimental, constantly on the fringe, redefining what is considered music. Each new artist studied tries something new to advance the concept. It's the kind of stuff that makes you cringe the first itme you hear it. Musical notes clashing together, shocking the listener at first and then slowly warming up. M83 work within a more secluded zone. Instead of trying to push the boundaries of what is considered music, work within those boundaries to create a fantastic album. The atmosphere is just plain enjoyable and blissful, allowing one to get lost in clouds of synths.   Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is more like a technosonic-rock collaboration. Instead of focusing solely on synthesizers and computerized music, M83 expands the instrumentation to include pianos, percussion, acoustic guitar, vocals, and even flutes. The album demonstrates an important lesson: that electronic music can simply be enjoyable without having to push the boundaries music composition.

B004LROUNG|5.0|This is one out of the Grisham stable that runs smooth and steady from start to finish. It's a clever story with the protagonist set firmly in the middle between two greeds (the corporate firm he leaves and the 'boutique' firm he joins) and how he realigns himself around what is really important - providing justice.<br /><br />Grisham describes and portrays the characters with great compassion and quite a lot of humour. The overall effect is like watching a play unfold.<br /><br />Nice plot twists too.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005PYIW10 The New Book of the Dead]]

1416955070|4.0|After recently picking up Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Angel and falling madly in love with it, I picked up a copy of City of Bones the book that I have seen on bookshelves for the past few years and constantly passed up at BN. I can't say I fell in love with this one but I did find it an enjoyable read. Not something I finished in one sitting but still devoured it within a couple of days.<br /><br />I love the urban fantasy genre and the world created by Clare was a very entertaining one to read about.  The world building was of course on point and I could visualize everthing that I was reading. The dialoge flowed and characters seemed  real enough, although I didn't find myself attached to any of the characters and I personally couldn't stand Simon.<br /><br />What really made me upset was the ending the whole Jace-Clary-Valentine relationship took me a minute to take in and than I had to go and ask some of my other fellow blogger buddies if things changed later in the series because otherwise I would have stopped at book one.<br /><br />Overall I did find this to be a fast read full of intense situations and filled with action packed pages. I did not find it to be what all they hype around it claimed but it still made for an interesting read and i'll be picking up the second book.
B005J7CUQ6|5.0|Various versions of this album exist. If you are taking the time to research which songs are part of each one in order to get as many tracks as possible, this might help you. I purchased this knowing it was 15 tracks & crossing my fingers that it wouldn't just be bonus remixes.  JP Limited Edition (2011 Sony Music Japan International Inc.) [UPC 4 547366 061888]  Here is the track listing:  01 Helena Beat  02 Pumped Up Kicks  03 Call It What You Want  04 Don't Stop [Color On The Walls]  05 Waste  06 I Would Do Anything For You  07 Houdini  08 Life On The Nickel  09 Miss You  10 Warrant   bonus tracks  11 Broken Jaw  12 Love  13 Chin Music For The Unsuspecting Hero  14 Pumped Up Kicks [The Knocks Speeding Bullet Remix]  15 Houdini [RAC Remix]  There are two insert booklets included, one (color) English and one (b&w) Japanese. The English insert includes lyrics to all of the standard version tracks (01-10). Fear not, the Japanese insert, which is a little smaller (and fits well in the fold of the other for safe storage), has the lyrics for the bonus tracks in both English and Japanese.  I'm not actually sure if \\"Broken Jaw\\" is available on CD other than the JP LE. It is available in digital via non-Amz & is a stand-out track (hence the finger crossing, heh). \\"Love\\" and \\"Chin Music\\" can be found on the Columbia Deluxe Edition, but I paid less for this one than that version would have cost me online (and as for trying to find one from BestBuy, I could not).  As for the music, it's indie dance pop bliss. Each song has unique musical aspects, but overall the sound remains uniform, so transitions throughout are kept smooth. Lyrically, the album is very entertaining, often amusing. The tracks are upbeat and uptempo, & there are many moments which give you a time-travel rush, so if you dig the first couple of tracks, you are unlikely to get bored with the extended playlist.  I urge you to, if undecided, taste first. All of the bonus tracks can be found for a quick (fan-provided) stream, and some of the standard tracks can be streamed from the official Foster the People site.

1451627289|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book since I hadn't read a Stephen King novel in years and the premise sounded exciting.  My expectations were heightened by a good review in the NY Times.  I put forth a valiant effort to finish it because I truly wanted to find out if George/Jake was able to stop JFK's assassination, but I read only 291 of the 800+ pages before I reluctantly gave up.  The time-travel story was very good and I admire the scope of the project, but I just couldn't get past the writing (my apologies to Stephen King and all his fans --- I used to be one myself).  Even though I read nearly 300 pages, I still didn't have a handle on even the main character.  The dialogue seemed artificial and stilted and no one \\"came alive\\" for me.  I just couldn't see myself slogging through the final 500+ pages.  So many books, so little time.
B005RKBZEI|5.0|Honestly Darren's best work since Savage Garden by far.  With this CD you can sense he's reached a peaceful point in his life and projects it in each song.  Downloaded it today from ITunes and I've been listening to it non stop ever since.  Each song has such a beautiful melody and message.  Must have for any broken hearted soul on the mend :)  Wish he received more airtime in the US.  Don't Give Up is the perfect PoP Chart Hit!!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it! The writing is absolutely beautiful. Anyone that wants to read some real literature needs to check out Jane Austen. Pride & Prejudice is a great story and a wonderful window into the English Regency Era. Expect to laugh and daydream. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth forever &lt;3
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I was so excited to have the DVD in time for Halloween, but was SO BUMMED when the dvd would not stop skipping. The DVD appears to be new, but the video is not of great quality. It skipped back to the beginning from the middle, then skipped a few more times and even froze once. QUALITY WAS BAD.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|This is a fantastic album from beginning to end; more so, in my opinion than their previous releases. Well at least for the everyday fan. Let's just put it this way; if i were to recommend one album for someone who has never heard the black keys it would be \\"attack & release.' For the typical  rock music fan, it can be seen as being much more catchy than their previous releases. If you are just starting to listen to the black keys I would start with this album and then brothers; after that, I would work my way back to rubber factory, big come up, etc. All of their work is incredible, in my opinion. These guys have a firm position in my top 5; I hope the megastardom hasn't gone to their heads yet, sadly it likely has. I wish they played ny more. If I get to see these guys in a small cramped venue in my lifetime, I will die a happy man.

0061537969|4.0|The story is from the perspective of the family dog, which may put some people off, but it's a terrific method of witnessing the drama unfold and still being able to throw in some comic situations to lighten the heavy parts.  I am not a fan of racing, but found the details about racing very engaging and interesting.  I love my own dog and loved Enzo.  This story may not be a good gift choice for someone who's just lost a loved one to cancer, without the benefit of several years to soften the loss.
B005QI4TP8|3.0|When I bought Lungs a couple years ago, I was convinced that there was no way anyone could make a follow-up album better than it. I'm sadly disappointed to say I was right.  Ceremonials exhibits Florence's flair for dramaticism: her loud, sweeping orchestra of sounds fill your eardrums with her voice at top volume, singing tales of love and an undertone of religion. Actually, let me rephrase that: if your favorite song from Lungs was \\"Rabbit Heart\\", there's a good chance you'll take well to the baroque pop of Ceremonials.  If your favorite songs from Lungs were more along the lines of \\"Blinding\\", \\"Howl\\", or \\"Kiss With A Fist\\", you'll feel left out in the cold here. Nearly every song on the album is blaring with Flo's siren voice, with much less variety than what was found on Lungs. The closest you'll find is maybe \\"Seven Devils\\", or possibly \\"No Light No Light\\".  Another thing: I think the sound engineers may have pushed the sound too far. Florence's voice becomes noticeably distorted at the high octaves on some tracks, in an apparent effort to make it jump out at you. Honestly, with all the instrumentation, her voice can sometimes get lost.  Before you downvote my review, know that I was and still am a huge fan of Florence + the Machine. I bought the Between Two Lungs 2CD import and the Lungs: B-Sides, and loved every track. I pre-ordered the deluxe edition of Ceremonials a month in advance. But this album just isn't for me.  I do wish she would have stuck more in line with the indie rock genre instead of shifting off to baroque pop, but we can't have everything in the world. I'll be sticking to Lungs for now, then.
1845023668|5.0|Oh, I don't think I will ever be able to express with words how much I enjoyed this book! Maybe if you were able to see the river of tears I cried while reading it, you could understand me. Eilidh is such a loveable character, so unfortunate, yet so strong.  I could be Eilidh..  Every woman could be Eilidh!  It was really easy to relate to her, and to feel the pain she is going through. But oh no..you won't be sorry for her, you will admire her! She is a fighter, someone you would love to be your best friend or a relative. I look up to her, for her strength to pick up the pieces of her broken heart and head towards a new life.  For even when the womb is empty and the heart is broken, hope is the last to leave. Make sure you never let it go, because When you let go off hope, you have nothing!  \\"Watch over me\\" is a debut novel by fantastic Daniela Sacerdoti. Funny, but while reading it, I didn't have the impression this is the FIRST book Daniela has written. I absolutely enjoyed every single page of it! By all means Daniela is a talented storyteller and someone that will surely conquer your hearts!
1576875776|5.0|The photographs in this book are immensely beautiful; uncannily unique, well-composed, subtle, thoughtful, and genuinely interesting to look at. These are pictures which I have little doubt will change how we think about, look at, and take photographs. Maier's work will become the standard which all other similar bodies of work will be judged by.   It is odd and most unfortunate that no attempt was made to get in contact with Maier during her lifetime. Her work was discovered in 2007, and it wasn't until 2009 that she died. This left two full years to allow for even an acknowledgement to her that her work had been found. From what I've read, there is nothing indicating she had any aliments that would have inhibited her from communicating with anyone, even late in her life.  The consequence of this lack of communication can be certainly found in this book. While the arrangement of the pictures is decent, it lacks the flow and subtlety that is present with the photographer arranging his own work - or even an artist close to him, who knows something about what the artist thought about the work. While it is known that Maier made narrative films and audio documentaries, it doesn't seem like she explicitly shared any insight about her photographs. This allows for sometimes questionable interpretations about her and her work which is distressing. For example, in the introduction by Maloof, he writes. \\"...the combination of Maier's intense privacy and lack of confidence in her own photographic prowess nearly resulted in her collection being consigned to oblivion.\\" How in the world does he know that Maier lacked confidence in her work?  \\"Street\\" photography - and I don't even really like calling it that - is something that requires a huge amount of confidence, both in your pictures and in your integrity as a photographer. There were likely very personal and fitful reasons why she never revealed her work which we will never be able to fathom, and it is meanwhile completely unfair to make statements or even educated assumptions about something we know absolutely nothing about.  On the point of arrangement of the photographs: pictures with similar shapes and patterns are put together on a page. This does bring attention to the excellent composition of the images, but this detracts focus from some of the more subtle details in an individual picture. It also makes the work seem repetitive, which both her work and street photography in general is certainly not. Many photographs that dominate two pages feel lonely and distant, and would mend well together with certain other pictures in the book. On the other hand, some pictures which share pages with other images are so quirky that they deserve two pages alone. There is a section at the end of the book full of self-portraits which is well-executed.   Printing quality is good with sufficient detail - though a bit dark, and I don't think the warm tone that was chosen compliments the work. Paper stock is glossy and of a good quality, and the construction of the book is solid. The cover is a neutral light gray cloth with the title, author, and publisher stamped on the spine and the initials \\"VM\\" stamped on the front cover. End-paper is a quirky orange. Printed in China, as are most photo books these days.   I wish that sometime in the future Maloof will hand this wonderful collection over to a trust or company that really knows how to publish photographs, such as the MOMA, so the work gets the presentation that it deserves. I'm exceptionally glad that he was able to unify this collection (after a lot if it got sold off) - and it's obvious that he genuinely cares about this work, but these pictures should be handled by a company or trust which is more accustomed with dealing with this high level of work.  The value of this book is great, but do keep in mind that it doesn't hold the level of quality that a \\"fine art\\" book would have, published a company such as Twin Palms or Steidl. It is a true pity that Maier could never share thoughts about her work. However, if you hold the mindset of letting the photographs truly speak for themselves, you'll be very pleased with this book.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I liked this movie a lot, it came on time and the cost was under $10. I can strongly recommend both the movie and the vendor
1451627289|5.0|If you didn't think you liked Stephen King, you have another think coming! This book is not horror.  It is not creepy, it's not science fiction, and it's not scary.  And I think it's the must read novel of the year, the first five star book I have read in a long time.  I will go out on a limb here and say that if you read any books I have recommended, read this one. (If you don't trust me, trust the New York Times.  They just named it one of ten best books of the year. First time King has ever been on that list!)  First thing let me say that this review will have no spoilers.  And this book is so cool that any details I could give you would absolutely, without a doubt lessen the impact and sheer entertainment value of it.  Although it was 849 pages I read it in less than a week, and at the end I was walking around the house with my Kindle attached to my nose!    The only summary I will give you is revealed in most every interview, the back cover and in the first chapter.  Jake Epping is a high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls Maine.  He gets summoned by his friend Al Templeton, who owns the local diner who is dying of cancer.  Al tells Jake he has found a time portal in the diner and has been back in time trying tracking Lee Harvey Oswald so he can prevent the death of JFK.  Al begs Jake to finish what he has started for him.  After all, when you return from the past only two minutes have passed, so it won't take but a bit... Jake reluctantly agrees and steps into the time portal in 1958.    The first half of the book Jake is getting used to the whole idea of living in the past and does some \\"personal business\\" in 1958 before going to Dallas to carry out Al's wishes.  The book does NOT just jump into the JFK part and that's one of the things that I really enjoyed about it.    Beyond that I don't want to tell you ANY details, or even spout some already quotable lines from the book that I have seen popping up on the internet that might give you even a clue of what will happen.    Jake is a wonderful character and you really come to love him and the people he meets and loves.  King also develops several other characters that you will really come to know and enjoy.  This is one my favorite aspects of the book.  In his horror books, the story is always the king (pardon the pun).  In this book, character development is just as important.  The other thing that most people will love is the whole idea of a man from 2011 living in 1958.  It reminded me of the first part of `Back to the Future,' where Marty gets called `Calvin,' all the time.  You can take a man out of 2011 but you can't take 2011 out of the man.  Ok I am going to stop now before I spoil anything.  Readers of my mom's generation will love the book for the rich descriptions of the sites sounds and attitudes of 1958 and the early sixties.   That's all I will say about the story.  I also want to say that although I have been a Stephen King fan for a long time, I have always considered him an \\"entertainer\\" and a \\"weaver of great yarn\\" more than I have considered him a \\"great\\" writer.  I was very impressed with the writing in `The Green Mile', `The Shawshank Redemption,'  `The Body' (the novella Stand by Me was based on), and a good number of his short stories, but for the rest (think his classics, `Carrie', `The Shining', `Firestarter', `Christine', et al) I thought they were great entertainment but not great novels. I haven't read 'The Stand' yet and I started the Dark Tower series but stopped after a chapter or two not thinking his fantasy epic was for me. (I think I am going to try them both again now).  I didn't like 'Cell' very much either.  But I love his early stuff and all of his short stories and novellas.  My high school friend Kristen just said last week, \\"it's not sexy to like Stephen King.\\"  This book changes all that for me and probably a LOT of other people.  He absolutely IS a great writer and not only can I not wait to see what he writes next, I want to take another look at all his other books that I have not read yet.    If you already are an avid Stephen King reader you will absolutely love the references to Derry, Maine.  A couple of the characters from `It' make a cameo, and the dark troubles that burden this small town are very much woven into the first half of story.  This is definitely a special gift from the author to his loyal fans!  Oh and one more thing.  If you ARE a science fiction fan familiar with the time travel genre you might not like the \\"rules\\" of time travel that King sets up when Al explains that the whole thing works.  I don't want to give ANYTHING about the book away, but Be Patient.  I think you will be happy how he ties it all up.  So in summary:  If you already like Stephen King you will love this book.  If you don't like Stephen King but like a GREAT story, I am willing to place a large bet that it's a sure thing you will also like this book!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset. It's extremely comfortable and fits over the ear. Not on the ear causing unwanted pressure.  I enjoy the voice changing presets. They are very fun to play with especially when gaming with friends.  The \\"on headset\\" volume control is very handy and the ability to turn the 7.1 Stereo setting on with the flip of a switch is nice.  A Simple flip up of the boom microphone is perfect for anyone who games.  I was able to walk 50 feet and 2 walls away with perfect reception.  These are great for listening to music and have 3 programmable pre-set start buttons for audio programs such as iTunes.  I highly recommend this headset for anyone looking for either a gaming headset or even something to listen to your favorite music.

B005N95JA4|5.0|Some Girls, The Rolling Stones' last great album, has just received the deluxe edition treatment. The original 1978 album, remastered, has been released with an accompanying 12 track cd of out-takes and curios from the same recording sessions.<br /><br />By then the Stones were at a crossroads - although the three studio albums following their early seventies masterpiece Exile on Main Street had their moments, each was flawed, lacking in direction and gave rise to the suspicion that the Stones were teetering on the brink of self-parody. Songs like \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Fool to Cry\\" sounded self-satisfied and arcane at a time when the energy and attitude of punk was beginning to revolutionise popular music.<br /><br />But the Rolling Stones are nothing if not resilient - their continued, scarcely credible existence today as a working band almost 50 years after they were formed bears witness to that fact. And so, over a period of five months from October 1977 to March 1978, in studios from Paris to New York, the Stones took their critics head on, crafting an album dripping with style, sleaze and sly humour inspired by the prevailing musical trends of the time, yet remaining true to their rock and blues roots.<br /><br />\\"Some Girls\\" kicks off with the irresistible four on the floor disco beat of \\"Miss You\\", the first hit single from the album. From the very beginning the record exudes a rude energy and immediacy - the recent addition of then new guitarist Ronnie Wood seems to have galvanized the band, freshening up Jagger and Richards' songwriting and the Stones are suddenly back to the irresistibly sloppy-yet-tight ensemble playing of their heyday.<br /><br />Although much is made of the disco influence on the album, which only occasionally peeks through, some of the standouts for me are the rockers. \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\", \\"Lies\\", \\"Respectable\\" and \\"Shattered\\" all pack a fair punch, songs influenced by the rising tide of punk and new wave, but still quintessentially the Stones.<br /><br />The guitars of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood intertwine to the point where it's difficult to tell who's playing what, while the stalwart rhythm section of Bill Wyman and, in particular, Charlie Watts on drums, are reinvigorated and drive these songs with precision and verve. Cameos from Chicago blues harp maestro Sugar Blue, and the Faces' and Small Faces' very own Ian McLagan on keyboards, among others, all add to the mix.<br /><br />The title track snakes its way along with Mick Jagger's knowing and deliberately provocative lyrics, and the band also clocks in a more than decent cover of the Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination\\".<br /><br />In an album full of highlights, special mention has to be made of \\"Before They Make Me Run\\", Keith's scabrous junky anthem, which he delivers with a certain wasted panache, the tough but tender \\"Beast of Burden\\" and the hilarious but somehow still affecting country gem \\"Far Away Eyes\\".<br /><br />\\"Some Girls\\" sees the Stones with their backs against the wall, railing against the dying of the light and producing some of the finest rock and roll of their career. They would never be this great again.<br /><br />The bonus cd of the deluxe version reflects the creative renaissance the Stones were going through at the time - although some of the tracks are filler, much of the blues, country and rock contained therein wouldn't be out of place on the original album.<br /><br />And that's a compliment indeed.f Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood intertwine to the point where it's difficult to tell who's playing what, while the stalwart rhythm section of Bill Wyman and, in particular, Charlie Watts on drums, are reinvigorated and drive these songs with precision and verve.

B005QVUZIU|4.0|I'll admit it, I winced and cringed when I heard Dreamworks was doing a Puss In Boots spin-off. The word \\"really?\\" was in my head every time I saw a trailer or a poster. Then I was invited to a screening of the film, and I was incredibly impressed. No joke. I really enjoyed the movie. I love Antonio Banderas and I love Henry Jackman, and I guess they played to my good side. The movie was an awesome fairytale western. The jokes were funny and on point and it even had a great amount of character. The story exists completely outside of the Shrek universe and that's a strong point. The music is also great as well. Henry Jackman shows his versatility by tacking a hispanic themed score.<br /><br />The music is full of great character riffs and has tons of character of its own. It plays homage to Ennio Morricone now and then. While I was expecting Harry Gregson-Williams to be onboard I think it stays with the idea of keeping this story completely removed from the world of Shrek. Jackman's tunes are fun and quirky and have tons of energy. The now incredibly popular Rodrigo y Gabriela lend their guitar talents to the score and two songs of theirs are used in the film as well. I must mention that the songs are not original and are from their first studio album. They do add a good deal of flair to the musical soundscape though just as they did for Knight & Day and Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. There is also lots of score included on this release. The running time of the CD is 65-minutes, and when you consider the film is a brisk 90-minutes that is a lot of score we have. The whole experience is just great. Henry Jackman is really growing into his own and with X-Men: First Class under his belt we know he can tackle big studio tentpoles.<br /><br />Puss In Boots was a nice treat. It's not as strong as most of the animation films out there, but we haven't seen Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek have onscreen chemistry like this since Desperado. Jackman's score is stunning and filled with energetic flair. Rodrigo y Gabriela add a touch of culture to the whole experience and make this an incredibly wonderful score.h energetic flair.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Very entertaining. the intricate puzzles are beautifully rendered and give the game a very high class aesthetic. definitely worth the money.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|So, this is a rare thing for me to do. I don't usually review compilation albums or song albums, but I'm making an exception here because the movie was scored entirely with Hawaiian songs. The songs are not original but they are an important part of the emotional flow of the film. I recommend seeing the film as their function comes across much clearer when heard as segway points in the narrative. The story is about a father who is about to lose his wife after she goes into a coma after a boating accident. He now has to deal with his 2 daughters as he struggles to come to terms with himself, his marriage and his past. The film is a nice poignant tale from Alexander Payne and is worth seeing.<br /><br />Off the bat I can tell you that the movie would have benefitted greatly from an original score. After seeing how the songs were used I really didn't find them to create too mich of an emotional connection between the characters and the audience. While Clooney's acting was phenomenal I did feel certain scenes would have been much better with score. The songs do become the score in some fashion very much like Alexi Murdoch's songs in Away We Go. Looking at the big picture the songs work really well, but I still think original music would have helped the film's tone and pacing issues.<br /><br />The Descendants is a good film with great acting. It's not the \\"feel good\\" picture of the year, but the unique setting and soundscape should prove alluring. The soundtrack is a great compilation of songs that were handpicked to tell the story, and while they don't function as score they do create a flow. An original score sprinkled with songs would have fixed the pacing problems I had with the film, but now we're just getting into personal opinions. It's a great film so go see it, and grab this CD if you want to enjoy some sounds of Hawaii.

0312995423|3.0|It is no wonder the used bookstore shelves are packed with this book.  The story is interesting and kept me engrossed to the end, but the writing style is something else.  The bad editing shows.  The book is repetitive ad nauseum, as if the publisher decided it is good to pad the book with unnecessary material to make it thicker.  Either that or they don't think we're intelligent enough.  A character discover something, then the discovery plays in their mind two or three times, then the next chapter starts with a re-cap of the same discovery.  Rather than heightening the suspense, this style hurts it.<br /><br />The other major problem is the research.  While Dan Brown may have researched cryptography a bit, his knowledge of computers barely exceeds that of the average AOL user, and it shows.  The system admin soldering boards?  Freon circulating in the processors?  A multi-billion dollar parallel machine accessible via modems?  If you know anything about computers, the myriad inconsistencies and inaccuracies will distract from the story.  This is fiction, true, but good fiction is good because it is believable.<br /><br />I can go on and on with textual problems.  Characters who are supposed to be very intelligent behaving stupidly, like leaving guns lying around.  David, the language expert, having really idiotic conversations. ...<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed this read, but have less interest in reading any more Dan Brown novels.  Perhaps I will watch the movies instead.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Have enjoyed several songs that are on the CD, not just the one I ordered it for.  Was definitely not disappointed with this selection.
B004EPZ020|4.0|Ok, I admit- I love the genre, so I'm biased a bit. BUT, it wasn;t the best of the series, and it's not as good as Bake Street Hauntings (and yes, BSH technically came first like someone mentioned). Everyone knows adding kids always makes us care more about the characters. Good idea..I think they should move on now to new story. Evil doesn't just haunt one group of people, hehe.
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|Someone told me about this book and I thought it would be interesting. Unfortunately while it has a 2009 publication date,  the information provided has a 1980s timeline. While the concept is good, the dating of the information and analysis makes it rather worthless. A quick read as it is very repetitive.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|What can I say? It's Testament- I don't think there's 1 metal fan that doesn't respect them. Especially the original line up (with Paul Bostaph). I can't wait for The Dark Roots of Earth in 2012..supposedly, it will be heavier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Have received the book on time and in good condition, but haven't recorded it yet.  Came in a box great for wrapping. It's all the original art and story. Giving to a grandchild I see periodically. Love the fact I can personalize it and she'll hear my voice when I'm not there.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|With so many films still to come this year, it can be safely said that Drive is one of the best films of 2011. I am so ecstatic about this film that I'm struggling to write about it with any coherency, afraid that I may stray into ranting and raving about how great it is. Seeing a great film (hopefully) isn't a rarity, but seeing a great film of this caliber doesn't happen too often. Rarely have I left a theater so eager to turn around and watch the same movie again, my only fear being that it couldn't possibly be as good the second time. Drive shares commonalities with last year's The American with George Clooney. Both were wide releases, marketed as action films that completely defied the expectations of their audience. The biggest difference between the two is that people went to see The American expecting an action film and were treated to alienating, slow-moving, art house fare. Drive lacks the art-house pretentions of The American and those who see it expecting an action film will be treated to something much more hypnotic and memorable than they expected. I saw Drive in an all-male, half-full theatre. Before the film began, they talked loudly with each other but went completely silent once the film began and didn't seem to move an inch until the end. Even those who are likely the target demographic for the Transformers movies were not immune to the spell this film casts.  The opening sequence is one of the best in recent years. It quietly introduces its unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling), the Driver, and establishes his skills as one. The sequence has no dialogue except for the police transmissions over the radio, yet few scenes are as gripping and suspenseful as this one. The Driver works for Shannon (Bryan Cranston) at his car garage, getting occasional work as a movie stuntman by day. By night, he occasionally operates as a getaway driver with a strict set of rules. The Driver is neither talkative nor effusive and has no back-story nor does he require one.Whether the Driver has any capacity for emotion isn't apparent until he meets his neighbor Irene (a stunning Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio. The three grow close, but Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) soon returns from prison. This is the catalyst for the real meat of the plot, where everything goes against expectations and Drive descends into shocking violence. It's common in modern films to have a character-driven first half and a second half driven by action and violence, which is, thankfully, not the case here. The film does reveal a violent nature, yet it bleeds into this second half with purpose.  Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, best known for directing the Tom Hardy-vehicle Bronson, this film netted Refn the award for Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. With a solid script as a foundation, Refn's direction is what makes this film the experience it is. It's an exercise in style that's never too flashy or too obvious. Drive is a \\"throwback film,\\" spawned from various influences to create something wholly original. The protagonist is similar to Clint Eastwood's archetypal Man with No Name, the driving scenes bring Bullitt to mind, the credit font recalls Risky Business, the music recalls 80s action films, and the cinematography and overall pacing bring French cinema to mind. Its influences are eclectic and blatant, yet this is not a film that relies on these influences to illicit recognition from viewers. Drive is not an easy film to categorize, making its wide release an act of bravery on the studio's part. Even in the composition there's a bravery rarely seen in modern cinema today. You don't often see a \\"mainstream\\" film that works as heavily with extended silences, hearkening back to a time where you didn't need to spell everything out to the audience. There are long passages of silence in, absolutely no CGI in the driving scenes, and minutes into the film I was hooked. It was apparent to me that I loved this film only twenty minutes in and not a moment where I doubted this initial assessment. Drive takes risks and pulls them off flawlessly. This is a film with scenes of (literally) heart-pounding suspense and (potentially) nauseating violence that moves with such a poetic force you're afraid to blink for fear of diminishing its effect. When watching a movie I am always aware that I'm sitting in a movie theatre, but Drive is an immersive experience that draws you into the atmosphere it has created on screen and once it gets ahold of you, it doesn't let go.  Gosling is a powerful force, portraying the Driver mostly with facial expressions, physical mannerisms, and a quiet conviction. He speaks only about twenty sentences in the film and his performance validates that he's one of the great young actors working today. To think this is the same actor from Crazy, Stupid, Love only a couple months ago is mind-boggling. Gosling was robbed of an Oscar-nomination for his heartbreaking work in 2010's Blue Valentine, but his performance is so pitch-perfect that he'll be hard to ignore this time. Also on Oscar-watch is Albert Brooks, known as a comedic actor, who defies the laws of typecasting with his terrifying performance as a Jewish mobster. Brooks is scary good in this role, nearly unrecognizable and truly terrifying. He should be a shoo-in. Ron Perlman also surprises, delivering a strong performance that begs for more roles in bigger movies.  Drive eventually reaches a stunning emotional climax that is a product of its editing as well as its execution. This is a film with a strong sense of direction, setting out to be something and never apologizing for itself or conforming to mainstream Hollywood rules. This is the most surprising film to come out of Hollywood this year, bar none. Surprising because it can be found at your local corporate cinema and surprising because of how unassumingly it sneaks up on you. Drive is a powerful, poetic, moving, existential cinematic experience that far exceeded myexpectations and will undoubtedly be one of the ten best films of 2011. Few films say so much by saying so little.  GRADE: A  Before seeing Drive, I had somehow avoided all promotional materials for it. I had heard good things since it premiered at Cannes, but I had not seen a trailer nor read any reviews. Having watched the trailer after seeing the film, I urge you to avoid it. The trailer depicts Drive as an action film and will ultimately bring more people to the theatre, but it also spoils nearly every surprise and almost every scene. While the biggest surprise of Drive is how different it is from how it's depicted in the trailer, which doesn't reveal even a hint of the film's tone, your ignorance to the contents of the trailer will leave your viewing experience rewarded.
B0018RBN8C|1.0|How Duffy ever managed to land a recording contract escapes me. She has nothing in her repertoire that would ever make up for her nasal and grating approach to singing.  I read comments that the song 'Mercy' caused many to buy the album. Are you kidding? Her so-called 'singing' on that track is deplorable.     Please, stop pretending that this woman passes as a musician. Pull your head out of your collective a$$es and get behind someone else, anyone at all, with a measure of talent.
B002BWP49M|3.0|Is it strange that what fans consider the worst book in the Twilight Saga has been made into the best film of the Twilight Saga? While general consensus may differ from this opinion, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is the closest these films have ever come to being \\"good.\\" Perhaps I went in with such low expectations that the film became better as a result of my own bias. Alas, no, I contribute this \\"success\\" to Academy Award winning director Bill Condon (in the interest of fairness, his Oscar win came for screenwriting) taking the reins and managing to do the unthinkable; elevate the material and those whose job it is to convey the material. This is certainly the best looking, most well-directed, and well-acted entry thus far. That's not to say the acting has actually teetered into the realm of the convincing or that the film succeeds as a good piece of cinema, but at least it's compelling more often than unintentionally hilarious.  With Summit Films taking a page from Warner Bros. treatment of the final Harry Potter movie, this film represents 50% of the last hurrah of the Twilight Saga and it enters territory previously unexplored in the past three films. In a typical review I would warn you that spoilers may follow, but any information I'm about to divulge about the plot seems to be common knowledge. I have never read the books or actively tried to have the story spoiled for me, but I also don't live under a rock and knew many plot details beforehand. Breaking Dawn opens with characters receiving invitations to the wedding of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The first person we see receiving an invitation is Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who storms out of his house upon hearing the news and before you know it...There goes the shirt. Yes, the long awaited human/vampire union has arrived and goes off mostly without a hitch. Minutes later, Edward and Bella have arrived on a private island in Brazil for their honeymoon. Here, the abstinence metaphor of the story is disregarded in favor of providing audiences with the most long-awaited onscreen deflowering in years. I warn you not to be too intrigued by this prospect as the \\"sex scene\\" is a total cop out. When the core audience that has made millionaires of many studio executives is under the age of seventeen, what can be shown is significantly restricted. In Breaking Dawn, the moment of truth is a swift cut to the next day where the room is in shambles and Bella is covered in bruises. I almost felt bad for the Twilight fans. They waited so long for...this?  Of course, the plot really begins when Bella discovers that she's pregnant with Edward's vampiric spawn and the fetus is growing at an accelerated rate that prompts them to rush back to Forks, Washington to be watched over by the Cullen Clan. Turns out that no one was aware a human could be impregnated by a vampire and that Bella's pregnancy will likely result in her death. Not satisfied with one dramatic conflict, Bella's pregnancy ends the peace treaty between vampires and werewolves making it Jacob's responsibility to dissent from his pack and help protect Bella.   After three years and three films of heavy petting, you get marriage, sex, and pregnancy all within an hour. Having previously been an allegory for abstinence, Twilight now succeeds at being an allegory for how quickly a young girl can ruin her life. The bizarre plot of Breaking Dawn works in its favor, making it more mature and compelling than its predecessors although its flaws simply cannot be overlooked. While the acting has improved exponentially, the dialogue has not and the visual effects are still piss poor. After three films, Pattinson has grown as an actor and no longer looking nauseated in every scene, actually manages to give Edward some depth of character. Lautner's boyishness hinders his performance in that it makes it hard to accept him as a masculine romantic lead. His determination and obsession with Bella make you want to reassure him \\"everything's going to be OK, scamp\\" rather than scream \\"yeah, bro!\\" Stewart, a usually capable actress in non-Twilight material, makes Bella more tolerable than ever but fails to make some of the film's most important scenes convincing. During the wedding scene, Bella doesn't look excited or nervous or jittery. She looks sick with a chronic stomachache. Meanwhile, Bella's pregnant look seems to be modeled after the people on \\"Meth Project\\" billboards. I don't need Twilight fans to explain the logistics behind her pregnancy; I'm aware that it's responsible for making her look that way. Pregnant belly aside, Bella seems to be in the throes of crystal meth addiction rather than suffering through a vampire pregnancy. The most embarrassing piece of acting comes from the pack of werewolves having a meeting in their werewolf form. The poorly-rendered CGI-wolves snarling at each other while the laughable voice performances sound lazily frustrated make this scene unintentionally humorous. Ironically, one of the most consistent aspects of all four films is Billy Burke as Charlie Swan. As in the previous entries, Burke is effortless and charming, continuing his trek through these movies unscathed. He is so natural and likable amidst the chaos that it makes his performance seem Oscar-worthy. His speech at the wedding actually made me smile; one of the few times I've ever smiled during these films for the right reasons.  Despite reportedly being a real-life couple, there remains a noticeable lack of chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson. Since this is where Bella officially, with no regrets, chooses Edward over Jacob I wonder why Stewart and Lautner have more chemistry and emotional connection. One of the most poignant moments of the whole saga occurs in a scene between Bella and Jacob after the wedding. Is this a reflection of the acting or is this how the story was written? The latter would make sense. I've given up trying to criticize the particulars of the story. I have many questions, beginning with why the Cullen Clan puts up with the immature girl with no personality, but my biggest question is about the logistics behind the sparkling. I don't know it works, but I know there are several scenes depicting Edward in broad daylight...And he's not sparkling. Did the filmmakers forget? Or am I just ignorant to the ways of the sparkle?  I have not read the books, but I now feel comfortable placing any blame on my qualms with the storytelling and/or dialogue on Meyer rather than screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg. I think Rosenberg does the best she can with the little freedom she has to tamper with the original text. I put bias aside watching these films, but I'll admit that I have no faith in the quality or intelligence of the writing. There's a moment of Edward and Bella playing chess, Bella making her game-ending move and exclaiming \\"I win!\\" The possibility that this wasn't the line she was passively given and that the writer had no idea what \\"checkmate\\" was did occur to me.  It's common knowledge that Meyer is Mormon, but nothing has made that more apparent than Breaking Dawn. When Bella is pregnant, the story becomes, with no subtlety, an allegory for the evils of abortion. The most uninformed, absent-minded viewer would be able to pick up on this. Edward alludes to abortion by saying they need to \\"get that thing out\\" and a character later scolds another for saying `fetus' with \\"Say it! It's a baby.\\" It's hard to ignore the anti-choice stance made when Bella, knowing her pregnancy will likely kill her, decides to go through with it. I don't believe the quality of a film is affected by it taking a stance on a controversial issue, whether that stance is parallel to my own or not, I just wish they could have been a little more subtle with their handling of this issue. I'm aware the Twilight Saga has never been much for subtlety, you've heard the dialogue, but the message is a little too heavy-handed and draws more attention toitself than necessary.  Breaking Dawn is very well shot, particularly in regards to the locale of the honeymoon, and it boasts a professional feel that the series lacked previously. Condon has not changed water into wine but his proficiency makes the long-awaited birth scene into a surprisingly harrowing moment, even without the restrictions considered. It's a well-edited and assembled scene that is certainly one of the most impressive in the movie. The execution of the final scene is actually effective too, an achievement I fully attribute to Condon as it's not what's being shown but how it's being shown that ultimately matters. Even with these moments of success, his handling of the imprinting scene is a low point. I don't know who could have handled this in a convincingly serious manner, but it plays like a bad joke and could possibly be the most embarrassing moment of Condon's career, as well as Lautner's.  Each Twilight film has been progressively better than the previous entry, or perhaps less terrible. Breaking Dawn skates close to the edge of being an acceptable movie, with the writing being what ultimately holds it back. Even with a knowledgeable director, compelling scenes, and actors who finally seem to care, it just can't rise above the foundation of Meyer's putrid writing. I admit that, despite how many times I rolled my eyes, I almost liked Breaking Dawn. For the first time with this series, I was entertained enough to say \\"hey, that was acceptable for the emotionally stagnant melodrama it is.\\" I did not think it was almost a good film, I did not almost understand its cultural impact, nor did I almost embrace the characters or their plight. With Eclipse, the Twilight Saga became more tolerable by morphing into an action film. Breaking Dawn becomes more tolerable by (almost) morphing into a horror film. I stand by my assertion that no one years from now will look back on these films fondly and I believe that the popularity of this series will completelydie out with the release of the final movie next year. I found Breaking Dawn compelling enough at times and it entertained me, but it's still a mediocre and poorly written mess. Eclipse was better than its predecessors in the sense that HIV is better than AIDS. With Breaking Dawn, it's better than its predecessors in the sense that it's like herpes...At least it's not HIV.  GRADE: C

B000QRIGLC|5.0|The reviews of this book are interesting indeed.  It's interesting that 1,100 folks rated it with five-stars and only 83 chose to rate it with one-star.  It certainly appears the lion's-share of the people approve of Mr. Luttrell's account.  The numbers don't lie. Of course, some rated it highly because he is an extreme patriot and warranted thier respect through his blood shed on the battlefield.  His devotion and dedication to our nation and the SEALs cannot be questioned.  And, I confess; I gave him five-stars instead of four-stars simply because I thought he earned it.  I also confess I thought he spent far too much space on his training as a SEAL.  I got the message that they were hard, bad-ass, efficient killing machines will into the first few pages of the book.  But, I already knew that.  Luttrell could have used a little help from his ghost-writer to make the flow of the story smoother.  It certainly could have been better written.  Nevertheless, I found the story captivating and very believable.  I find it interesting that those, who criticize the book most, appear to be politically opposite of Mr. Luttrell.  I also have no problem whatsoever that he proclaims his fondness of George Bush, Texas, the SEALs and his voices his disdain for the liberal press.  That's his feelings; he's the author; let him say what he wants.  If they don't like what he says, they can write their own dang book. Or like the morons they are, just stop reading the book.  Overall, this was a very moving account of an operation gone terribly wrong.  It tried in its own way to be a testament to the bravery, courage, and training of some very special men--all of whom I am very proud.  Mr. Luttrell is very deserving of the decoration awarded to him.  I salute him and thank him for telling his story, even if at times his co-author let him down.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I have bought and tried two sets of these.  The design is good--stays on when running and is comfortable. But durability is very poor.  The first was staticky from the get-go.  The second soon became that way despite very careful handling.  THe wire is just too thin and any movement near the plug causes static, or one ear goes in and out.  I bought a Panasonic pair [[ASIN:B00004T8R2 Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port]]at the same time that were even cheaper, and they are much more durable, and have better, more detailed sound as well. They had much thicker wire, and a little longer wire too. They just are not designed to stay on while running, unfortunately.

B000001EXR|5.0|Found this gem by accident.  I'm a huge fan of the Seattle sounds of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana, etc., and must say this album fits right in and blows all preconceived notions of \\"KISS\\" away in my mind.  Too bad, very much too bad, that this wasn't released to the public sooner in lieu of their reunion tour.  Very creative, driving, dark, and a wonderful listen starting with song #2 \\"Rain\\".  I'd recommend just starting there, in fact, on your journey through this wonderful album.  Absolutely floored me, and makes one wonder what could've been.

B001CZJKS0|3.0|Ahh, 1978. The year of the first Halloween, the movie that spawned countless sequels, remakes, and copiers. This pack comes with 6 discs, Halloween, Halloween (Blu-ray Edition), Halloween (Extended Cut), Halloween: 25 Years of Terror (Documentary), and Halloween 4 & 5. But, when I ordered this, I thought Halloween 1-5 would be there. They just skipped over 2 & 3. But, I guess that's what you get for not reading the full description. The picture that they use for this item makes it look like a Michael Myers mask. But when it came to my house, it wasn't a mask. It was just a small, pointless sculpture that you can't even take out of the box. Yeah, there were some cool bonus features, but I just wanted all of the Halloween movies, heck, even Halloween 3.

The controller has good response times and the buttons are feel great.

It's incredibly responsive that moon walking with The Captain and even minis with Ganon are extremely easy. Even shine wavedashes all day, lol. I guess the color is cool because it matches the Wii but I really don't care that much, could just spray paint a regular one if I wanted it for aesthetics. Overall great controller, just hope it can taking a melee beating.

B005HV6Y84|2.0|I am a big fan of the books and soundtracks, and to a lesser degree the movies. The first 3 soundtracks produced for this saga were phenomenal. They remain among my all time favorite albums. This is the first flop they have had. Christina Perri's song is the only song worth having. I can see how some of the songs may fit the movie, but they do not have any merit on there own. They are boring and do not compare to the talent seen on the previous soundtracks such as Muse, Florence and the Machine, and the Black Keys (only to name a few). I was also terribly disappointed that there was no Muse song on the album at all. They have been on all the previous soundtracks and Stephanie Meyer said they were a large part of her inspiration while writing the books. They should have had a song on every soundtrack. I hope for BD part II they manage to get back to their usual greatness.

B001UV4XIS|2.0|When you see \\"digital copy included\\" on a DVD case, you (rightly) assume there will be a movie file you can just download onto your desktop/laptop/other device for accessing later. Access is the key term here. Ultraviolet lets you access your digital file but only when you're around an Internet connection. No more watching movies offline with this service so now you're at the mercy of bandwidth limitations and, in turn, you can reduce the bandwidth of others at your home by having to stream this content whenever you want to watch it.  Why was this decision made? Well the easy answer is money. Plus they are trying to kickstart their new service and the only way to do that is to FORCE people into your service. Why would people want two Netflix accounts (Ultraviolet and Netflix both stream)? They don't, the movie companies are hoping you'll ditch Netflix and sign on with their new service. It's garbage, but these are the times we live in.  The movie itself? It's wonderful. It's adult. The kids aren't children anymore and the dark realities they've lived through have taken all the innocent shine off of wizardry and magic and it's all about friendship and survival now. I kind of wish this series had gone on longer, now that it's over, but J.K. Rowling certainly did a good job of tying up all the loose ends, even if there was more we wanted to explore before the curtain came down.  Whereas \\"Deathly Hallows 1\\" felt like the ultimate game of hide and seek for Potter and his friends, in this last installment, the group of friends collects what they feel they need to fight and then they stand up and fight. And what a battle royale it was.  It's a shame the movie studio gimped what was a nice package with discs and digital copies. Perhaps studios felt there was too much piracy going on with digital copies or that they would rather have some sort of data aggregation to know how well their service works. But the digital copy represented here is not what we consumers have come toexpect from the term. If we don't actually own the digital copy, then why say we are getting one? Perhaps \\"get access to a streamed version of this movie via our proprietary system that you need to sign up for\\" just doesn't sound good to marketers. So let's call it the same thing and the public can just deal with it. That's my guess.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|Michael Crichton is one of the main reasons why I read and I will always be a fan of most of his novels, except for the truly dumb \\"Eaters of the Dead\\". In fact, if not for his effluent prose and poetic license, I'd probably still be a practicing veteran in Northern Vietnam, reforming unemployed rickshaw taxi operators who dropped out of school. After suffering through \\"Pirate Latitudes\\", the first posthumous piece of garbage about piracy in Jamaica in the 17th century, I was surprised to discover there was another unfinished manuscript being completed by Richard Preston. I knew it wouldn't measure to Crichton's usual standards because the prose would lack the formal metrical structure in his other books. Can you really expect an untrained veterinarian to understand iambic pentameter or even basic engineering principles? Preston should be writing books about what to do when your pet has diarrhea, ferchrissakes!<br /><br />What's worse is that Crichton used to be an excellent science fiction writer, but he gradually changed over the years by leaving out the science and adding more fiction. In \\"State of Fear\\" he lectured about Global warming being a myth, even though a large majority of scientists disagree with this view. I don't consider myself a climate expert like most of the anti-Global Warming people who want to force you to believe their opinion, but don't you think that supporting a few scientists paid off by large corporations is ludicrous?<br /><br />While the premise is slightly more believable in Micro, the size reduction of machines and humans reads more like a documentary without any noticeable character development. Besides, Femto-technology will undoubtedly be used in the future, thus making the Micro title dated.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|Keep this in mind when reading this review: I LOVED Transformers as a kid. They were the popular thing when I was younger. The toys were hard to find and you were the coolest kid on your block if you had one. The cartoon was innocent and fun and the characters were easily identifiable.  Enter the first Transformers movie. Not bad, but too dumbed down (John Turturro, that was a laughably bad performance).  Enter the second Transformers movie. With the origin-related stuff out of the way, I expected this one would shine. It was AWFUL.  Enter the third Transformers movie. This may have been the movie Michael Bay was trying to make all along. It isn't nearly as ridiculous as the second movie but it still struggles. A lot of the action sequences are done with the shaky cam effect so it can be really difficult to discern at times what is going on. When one robot tackles another, good luck trying to make out who is who. The easily identifiable traits from the cartoon series have been replaced with a much more generic look for all of the robots. The comic relief seems to borrow from all kinds of undesirable stereotypes and the humor is largely classless. This isn't a movie you should be proud of showing to kids.  Of course, if you enjoyed both of the previous installments, you will most likely enjoy this one.  A couple nerd points: just because robots are old doesn't mean they should have beards. I mean, really. Also, why is Megatron, the most powerful evil robot, subjugated to being someone else's whipping boy in the last two movies? The entire cartoon series was between Megatron's Decepticons and Optimus Prime's Autobots. Isn't that enough? Why introduce \\"the Fallen\\" and then introduce this other character that nobody has ever heard of? Because the evil guy needs to die at the end and you can't re-kill Megatron over and over? It seems rather lazy of the \\"writers\\" to brush off the main rivalries.  All of the actors mailed this one in, too. \\"Come do your scenes half-heartedly and let's make some money\\" appears to have been their guiding directive. When movies gyrate between not taking anything seriously at all, then forcing these same goofballs to act deadly serious, it just doesn't work very well. It's disposable entertainment. And I'm rather pissed Michael Bay has chosen this franchise (he thought the Transformers franchise was a stupid idea before he took the job) to crap all over. This was my childhood. I had just forgotten what George Lucas did to the Indiana Jones series when this garbage came and destroyed something else that was good when I was a kid.

B005SZNZAY|4.0|Chris Cornell finally comes back to reality, at least for me. After the last horrible solo CD, a couple average CD's with Audioslave and a few other stops, this CD brings him and his beautiful yet  powerful Voice back to the forefront. Man and his Guitar. Im a sucker for Acoustic live CD's(albums), but this one is great in terms of the variety of song selection and the aforementioned Voice. He sounds in rare form. I am very disappointed in myself for missing him when he made a tour stop locally after hearing this.<br /><br />I wont do an extreme breakdown of all tracks, but obviously the Soundgarden songs are well done as they are just great songs. No surprise. Temple of the Dog is represented here as well with 'All Night Thing' and 'Call me a Dog'. Stellar! Sound great after all these years in this fresh setting. His solo material is strong and sounds as if they were originally just written by him with his guitar. These interpretations make them even more personal and i will listen to them more than the originals.<br /><br />The couple covers are cool as well. 'Thank You' is so sweetly done and so well sung it brings on a sense of contemplation that is as good as the original. Plant/Page should be proud of this bare bones rendition. 'Imagine' closes the Live portion and is good as expected, but i wasnt floored by it, though, i hate to say, it was never one of my favorite songs anyway.<br /><br />But what (surprisingly) is best about this is how good the Audioslave tracks 'I Am The Highway' and 'Like A Stone' come across. 'Doesnt Remind Me' is done with a nice swagger. Turns out less is more with these tracks as they really shine and are very well sung. These 2 songs are worth the price of this.<br /><br />There are a couple new tracks as well which round this CD off and make it more interesting and desirable to purchase. 'Cleaning My Gun' is a really good track that may be just a touch too long for its own good. 'The Keeper' is a acoustic studio track that is sweet. Nice chord progressions and smooth. Hopefully a sign of things to come after the disaster that was 'Scream'. He may not want to go Grunge/Metal anymore, but this style fits. No band needed.<br /><br />Why the 4 instead of 5? Well, to me it sounds a bit 'loud'. It sounds great, dont get me wrong, but to ME it just sounds like it was pushed up a but loud in the mix giving a static sounding 's' sound and some inappropriate feedback, so i had to do some adjusting on the treble end when listening. Not a big deal though. But it was enough for me to drop 1 star. So its not about content, its about sound. It still is a great quality recording, you just may need to mess around with the EQ.<br /><br />Very cool CD and a reminder of what a talent the man is. Highly recommended, Pick it up.opefully a sign of things to come after the disaster that was 'Scream'. He may not want to go Grunge/Metal anymore, but this style fits. No band needed.

B004A8ZYZE|4.0|So many professional help books are boring, this one is not, and well worth the read.  I was thinking , the catchy title means another gimmic or some kind of trap to get you to pick it up, but getting started, i found it not the case.  If you struggle with presentations, and trust me, you do, then taking the time to work through this book will force you to evaluate your style, methods, and organization of your speaking.  I have been able to improve my methods and preparations using some of the suggestions presented in the book.  I was always struggling with putting too much information into a speach , but taking advice on how to structure a speach from the book helped.  Iwas suggested to look at the message i was imparting to the audience as the focus of my effort, instead of the content and data, which are supposed to be more supporting material...simple things that make it all flow .. we all think we know how to present material, but when you read this book, you see how presentations are recieved by and audience with a whole new perspective,a nd you will find things useful to use in your own methods when speaking.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This concert is amazing. I wish I could have been there for it. Not only is the Blu-ray picture unbelievable, but the talent of the performers is out of this world. If you are a fan of music in general or the story of Les Miserables, this is definately worth your time and money.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This is NOT a boring management book, pick it up , read it.. it is amazing storytelling of something so mundane as a checklist, that you will be amazed at how these simple tools, are NOT used by many, and the huge impact they can have if implemented properly.  HAven't you ever wondered how a hostiptal can screw up a routine operation, or how an airline pilot can forget to put out the landing gear?  These are examples of stories that really happen and how a checklist, actually changes things for us all everyday and wee may not know it.  i've always been  aperson who has lists and notes and i find a lot of the suggestions in the book to be so true with the simple things i use a checklist to accomplish.
B000002IAZ|5.0|One of the all-time great, great albums.  All three of the original Springfield albums are terrific and well worth having in your collection, but Retrospective is just a wonderful \\"best of\\".  Every track on this album is excellent.<br /><br />I bought this album, probably in early 1970, on a recommendation without knowing anything about the group.  From the first play, I fell in love with it and have played this album countless times since.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|The ultimate reality show is the naration of a wartime participant among the worst fighting the US saw in WWII.  This is more than a story book of who does what and when and why, heck at times a forget what i am reading and know about the war as i was drawn into the experience of following these guys around day in and day out and feeling thier struggles as they unfolded for them.  What makes me likethis book above other wartime stories, is the naration is storytelling hour by hour of what one guy felt as events happened, not just a typical what happened account.  Hearing the emotion in a voice helps with storytelling and this book really captures that effect for just ink and paper...

0385534639|5.0|I read this, not because of all the hype (which I was largely unaware of) but because Erin Morganstern wrote a pep talk for NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) and I liked her writing. But it didn't prepare me for how absolutely wonderful this book is! It's been a long time since I've loved--not liked, LOVED, a book this much. As in, I wanted to move to the circus and live with the characters and never come back out to rejoin reality, which isn't nearly as beautiful. Her imagery is just fantastic--you can smell the caramel and the faint smell of smoke, you can watch the archers shoot multi-colored flames and hear the gentle \\"whsst\\" as the arrow flies. Just gorgeous. As another reviewer said, I never wanted the book to end, but couldn't wait to find out what happened. I don't completely understand how the ending worked, but so what? I adored the book--I want to read it again to really savor the language and see what I  missed the first time. LOVED it!
0393064476|5.0|Readers may note that my review of WILL IN THE WORLD shows I am a fan of this author, but still, I didn't think he would manage to write another book that delighted, moved, and stimulated me to that extent.  With THE SWERVE (note: weird title, even though he explains it), he does.  When I was young and foolish, I adored Hermann Hesse's THE GLASS BEAD GAME for its concept of a world where science and art, philosophy and physics, religious impulse and joie de vivre, all somehow mixed together and became a dependable course of learning.  I am one of those who believe that when we stop learning, we die, as well as a closet Classicist and a lover of the very concept of Western renaissance.  So how could I not adore this book, which reminds me of the Bead Game in that every page brings together several things I hadn't thought of and makes sense of them?  We start with one of a handful of surviving copies from the shattered Classical world of Lucretius' \\"On the Nature of Things,\\" almost the only surviving display of Epicurian thought - and if you think \\"eat, drink and be merry\\" sums that philosophy up, you are required to read this book.  Again and again Greenblatt, in the midst of a fun almost-mystery-thriller story of rediscovering the lost masterpiece of Lucretius, mixes it all up and throws down the dice and - voila! - I've learned something new, see something different, find a pattern I had not expected.  The joyous, non-Christian, atomic, poetic, profoundly curious notions of Epicurus slowly filtered into a fundamentalist world of Christian thought and, like a pebble in the lake, began to change everything.  Yes, it is a strain to say Lucretius' and Epicurus' atoms led to the Renaissance, but the argument is made with deft and passionate scholarship.  So maybe . . .?  This is, to me, the best kind of intellectual exhilaration and it's very rarely found.  It doesn't matter if you don't know a thing about either Lucretius or dear Poggio or Botticcelli, if you understand the rise of science, the fall of fundamentalism, the moves of nations.  If you believe that the concept of individual human achievement and the life of the mind is important, READ THIS BOOK and enjoy his dancing prose.  You'll be thinking about it long after the book is done.
B001R0XNSI|4.0|This is a self defense item for those who live and work where you can not carry anything else. It is made of hard modern materials. It does write so you can still call it a marker. As a self defense tool it is used as a kubaton. I like mine and I am glade I bought it. I carry mine daily.
0553801473|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series. I skipped Feast for Crows. I wish I had skipped Dance of Dragons. The quality is so bad I have trouble believing Martin really wrote it. Is he doing the Tom Clancy thing, having ghostwriters crank out product while he's off enjoying his money? I only got through about 100 pages before I gave up - I quit after an interminable ride in some kind of carriage with Tyrion and an old friend of the eunuch Varys, chatting, eating, drinking and stopping to piss several times. Dany is stuck in some dreary city bored out of her mind and boring the reader. Pass on this one.
B0057FWSQ2|5.0|This collection is not just for the novice seeking a glimpse of the Goddess of punk rock. I have all the original albums and bought Outside Society to have a good listening experience again since the original pressing are frankly a bit worn out. CD'are OK, but listening to vinyl brings it all back for me. The remastering is excellent and the band sounds as good as possible.  But it is really all about Patti. A true gift to the world. Thanks Patti!
0307010856|5.0|This really is a classic. I remember buying this book from the supermarket over 35 years ago and it was one of my favorite early readers. I bought this a few years ago and my toddler and pre-schooler both love the book (especially when I talk like Grover). The book has nearly perfect English grammar and it covers the subject of unsubstantiated fears.   It is good silly fun, but well written and well loved in our family.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an awesome game,  I love it.  I had this app on my Ipod, I liked it on that but I love it on this better. and these are the reasons! great graphics, bigger screen I always shot them backward by ecsadent lol, and I like the way you go to the home screen. :)
B0068TJLSY|2.0|I usually don't rate movie at Amazon. But this movie is just not good enough that I need to voice my opinion.  I was expecting more from Steven Spielberg. The plot is too vague. How did the Air Force got the Alien? There is only one shot that you can see more clearly the face of the alien - but it was dark. The communication and inter action between the Alien and human are just not enough in this movie. The movie end quickly without explaining too much. Movie is about 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  There are better movies out there - just not this one. I'm disappointed.  I wathced the Blu-ray version and the picture sharpness and color are excellent in our 46 LCD TV.

B002KAOSEW|2.0|I love the Jack Reacher novels, but this one seemed to lack focus. Reacher always fights for someone who's been wronged, but in this one he comes off as a bully because a town tells him he can't stick around. His motivation for sticking his nose into things wasn't in line with his character because there was no victim.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|If I was some sort of quirky scientist fooling around with cloning experiments, I would likely be the type who would mix up various peoples' DNA to see what I could come up with.  However, I'm not (I don't even play one on TV) but I think someone else is.<br /><br />Why, you ask?<br /><br />Because I think someone has cloned Janis Joplin, Bonnie Bramlett, Melissa Etheridge and Amy Winehouse into one person and named her \\"Beth Hart\\". I know that I've definitely heard her music over the years - I just didn't know who it was singing.  Yeah, I am embarrassed to say that I've only now \\"discovered\\" her via her collaboration with Joe Bonamassa on their CD, Don't Explain.<br /><br />See, being a Bonamassa fan pays more dividends than just hearing his great music.<br /><br />As I said in my review of Joe's album, Dust Bowl, I learned my lesson about trying to catch a hot CD while it was in-stock in the stores.  When I saw this collaboration announced online, I pre-ordered it so that I could be sure to have it while the ink was still drying on the CD cover.  Am I ever glad I did.<br /><br />I was privileged to indulge myself - uninterrupted - in the great sounds from Don't Explain during a recent round-trip to California.  The album starts out with an incredible cover of the 1957 Ray Charles number, Sinner's Prayer.  Wow!  Hart's interpretation of the tune makes me want to run to the nearest alter every time I hear it.  The only negative I can say about this is that the world has definitely been robbed since a duet with Mr. Charles and Ms. Hart singing this song will never happen.  Can you imagine what that would be like?  Needless to say, Sinner's Prayer is one of several Boomerocity favorites on this album.<br /><br />Another favorite is the treatment of the Bill Withers 1973 tune, For My Friend.  While the Withers tune still stands the test of time over the close-to-40 years, I suspect that Beth's version is one that will also be talked about 40 years from now, it's that good.<br /><br />One tune that should put Hart/Bonamassa into the history books (and is yet another Boomerocity favorite) is their incredible cover of the Etta James song, I'd Rather Go Blind.  I have worn this song out. Actually, I've worn out the repeat button on my iPod.  Rounding out the Boomerocity fave list is their rendition of the Delaney and Bonnie hit, Well Well.  I usually don't take too kindly to folks messin' with my D&B but, after listening to this cover about a bijillion times, I had to grant special dispensation - `specially since both Joe and Beth flawlessly channel the Bramlett's in their performance.<br /><br />While these tunes represent my favorites, let me be clear: The entire album is great.  I would go as far as to say that it's a must-have for lovers of blues, jazz and good ol' classic rock.  It would be a great, early Christmas gift to yourself and for the music lover in your life.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comry books (and is yet another Boomerocity favorite) is their incredible cover of the Etta James song, I'd Rather Go Blind.

0385523904|5.0|I have never written a review about anything on amazon.  This tells you how much I care about this book.  The book tells the tale of six individuals who defeated and you can relate to everyone of them.  Barbara did an excellant job in describing them in details in their day-to-day lives.  What they wear, what they eat, what they try to do to survive in the horrible environment that they are not even aware of.  There are ups and downs in their lives and you would be able to experience their lives at the comfort of your living room or bathroom (depends where you usually read....).  I hope that you would enjoy this book as much as I do.  I first notice north korea when I was running an application that has more than 20 million users all over the world.  When I looked at analytics, north korea has ZERO users.  My ignorance and curiosity drive me to this book and it delivered a lot of the answers I been longing for.
1451627289|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!! I was engrossed from the beginning. Most people don't realize that he's more that just a horror writer, his character development and narrative are so good.  Not since The Stand has he held my attention this way. Glad to see he ended this book well.  His last opus was Under the Dome, and while I liked the premise and the book, it seemed like King had no idea how to end it.  As a matter of fact I still don't get that ending.  Regardless this was was great from beginning to end!!  Also buy this on the Kindle - King was made for the Kindle due to the length of his books.

Not bad for $1.99.  The only hiccup was that I had to learn how to \\"refresh\\" the display of available apps on the Fire because I purchased the game from my PC.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />This is a world-record-setting international smash hit music album that continues to top bestseller lists more than nine months after its release.<br /><br />Why?  What is it about Adele's music that captures the fancy of millions of people across the globe?  Top notch musicianship and out of this world blue-eyed soul singing are the easy answers, but plenty of top forty albums have that to some degree.<br /><br />It's the sadness silly.<br /><br />There is a tone of beautiful sadness draped over this album that reaches out and encircles the listener, drawing them in with a kind of Kaa-like serpentine hypnosis that is difficult to shake.<br /><br />The world is troubled.  Like modern day Dickensian characters we live in the best of times and the worst of times and while we humans may not necessarily enjoy being sad, we do enjoy working out our own despair through relating to the experiences of others.  And the more beautifully expressed those experiences of others are, the more we want to relate, perhaps feeling that some of that beauty will rub off on us and turn our pain into our poignancy.<br /><br />Adele has become a sort of British, musical Mona Lisa - look at the cover of this album - like the Mona Lisa, the composition and expression of the face is enigmatic and inviting - almost seeming to ask for the projections of humanity's feelings upon her.  Hers is the ideal beauty because she is not ideally beautiful.  Open for interpretation, genuine, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />Come to Adele, and she will sing you through it.  Shhh, it's okay, you're not the only one - let's hurt together tonight and maybe everything will be a little better in the morning...<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listnener
B001D2AYCI|5.0|I just found a million dollars. I've had this in my collection for quite some time. When I bought it, my old Sony Multi-Channel reciever wasn't working up to par and I was unable to have proper 5.1 sound. I recently replaced that reciever and I'm up and running again, enjoying the new Pink Floyd 5.1 Mixes, and wonderful Blu-ray movies. So, I'm sitting here browsing through other DVD audio, for purchase on Amizon. After ordering Queen's A Night at the Opera in 5.1, I continued browsing and came across this. \\"Hey wait!\\" I said,\\"I HAVE this!.\\"<br /><br />Holy crap! Black Sabbath in 5.1 surround sound! It sounds FANTASTIC! While most bands' surround mixes try not to stray to far from the original, simply utilizing all 5 speakes instead of 2 for clarity, THIS mix is VERY different from the 2 channel mix we all know and love. Suprises are around every corner on every track. Purests will want to stick with the original. As for me it's like hearing it for the first time! I could go on and on using words like incredible, awesome, and insane, and all would be valid, but the truth is you just gotta hear this for yourself. This is by far my favorite surround mix out of the ones I've heard so far.<br /><br />Now the music has ended, and I'm broke again! ORDER THIS!
B0000025R3|5.0|You can play this album all the way through without skipping.  All songs are good.  Singles back in '82 were \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\", \\"Down Under\\" and \\"Be Good Johnny\\".  Solid, creative song writing.  \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" has one of the most memorable Sax melodies EVER!  You can't go wrong here.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|As much as I like the note feature, my favorite part of this application is the calendar feature. Before I found this I just used a calendar I made in Microsoft Word on my computer, which I couldn't edit on my Kindle. Now I can add and edit events easily. Together with the note taking aspect, it's perfect.
0399243860|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was one.  His favorite book from infancy was Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? and so I thought it would be good to get him another book by the same author.  I was disappointed when I found it was way too advanced for him and he had no interest in it.  However, now that he is older (27 months), this book is his favorite!  He is just starting to be able to match the colors with the pictures.  We read it every night together and with each night, his memory and comprehension grows.  I am so happy with this book and glad I didn't give up on it earlier.
B003BZXHX8|1.0|Oh my goodness- this was on PBS last night and I came across it as I was flipping channels. I bought the CD/DVD set when it first came out. But after watching the DVD I never played the CD. I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Seeing it again, even just for a few seconds, made me shudder and gave me a sour stomach! The whole act is so dull and self-congratulatory. Barbra sounds AWFUL and looks GHASTLY, draped in the obligatory black caftan like some sort of severely-bloated VAMPIRESS. All those years of bleaching had ruined her hair by this point, and in the stark nightclub lights she appears to have cellulite on her FACE, of all places! Goodbye, gorgeous!<br /><br />As others have already complained, there's WAY too much talking and BS in this mini-concert, but I can't actually concur when it's said there isn't enough music, since what singing there is amounts to just a lot of pitiful croaking and the less of that, the better, IMHO. The ass-kissing between her and her elite \\"inner circle\\" does goes on forEVER. It's like being inside a Braddly Briggs review, everyone shouting \\"Bravo\\" and throwing their life savings and first-born children at \\"the goddess!\\" OY! Poor James Brolin looks like he is being held hostage. Pretending he isn't sorry he got himself into this \\"marriage\\" is surely the best acting of his career, but it's clear from one look at his face that inside he's screaming \\"SOMEONE HELP MEEEEE!!!\\"<br /><br />Favorite moment: when Barb is shown arriving for the \\"event\\" and is seen exiting her limo we hear an outcry off-camera from the crush of devoted-diehard worshippers being held behind police barricades at the end of the block by a phalanx of NY City's finest. She hears the noise, quickly turns, bats a false eyelash and waves a fingernail at them all (the middle one, I believe), those who have been waiting in the cold for hours just for a glimpse of their idol, those who have paid her rent for SIX DECADES, those who have been waiting a lifetime to see her but don't get that chance cuz she chose instead to perform to a room of only 100 \\"privileged attendees,\\" and then she just . . . . disappears. It's so Barbra! It's so characteristic of Barbra! She \\"farts in their general direction,\\" to quote Monty Python, and then just leaves them there with their tongues hanging out.<br /><br />It's funny to think that these very fan(atic)s, who LOVE HER soooo much, would have stampeded and ripped her to pieces were it not for the barricades and the armed security detail. Ah stardom! She lives in terror of this very scenario, and has nightmares about psycho fans landing on her Malibu estate from rogue airplanes. Yet she continues to manufacture this hysteria by maintaining this illusion of herself as more gifted and divine than the rest of the unwashed masses, who made her what she is/was, and making an appearance that is SO EXCLUSIVE that anyone who attended had to forego fluids for 48 hours beforehand because there was no way the plumbing in this tiny hole-in-the-wall could have accommodated the 100 lucky ticket-holders who were kept waiting for hours on end while this \\"event\\" cranked up and then groaned onward interminably into the New York night. Yowza!<br /><br />Anyway, I will hold onto this set in the event I'm ever in a situation where an antidote to poison is needed. Watching a few seconds of Barb at the Village Vanguard is sure to induce vomiting!
B00631VJIC|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />More highly rated than hits like THE SHIELD, NIP/TUCK, and RESCUE ME, SONS OF ANARCHY is a popular television show on FX about an outlaw motorcycle club, but you don't have to be a fan of the show or an outlaw biker to enjoy this album, though I'm sure it wouldn't hurt if you were either one of those things.<br /><br />This release is notable for combining music from each of three previous iTunes only EPs into one album.  If you're new to SONS OF ANARCHY then keep in mind each of these tracks was recorded for the show and the familiar songs are all cover versions.  Good cover versions.  But some are not straight covers - the Spanish version of Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin' for example...<br /><br />If you love rock music (both slow and fast) and you don't mind hearing a talented actress and musicians (such as Curtis Stigers, Anvil, or Alison Mosshart) join together to bring some California biker flavored feeling to classics from the likes of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, CCR, The Who, and The Stones, then you should give this one a try.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The movie itself is what one would expect from the Harry Potter series - entertaining, great visuals, and marginally true to the book.  If you're interested in the UltraViolet Digital Copy, be warned.  The streaming from the site (which is Flixter, fyi, not provided directly from UltraViolet) was extremely choppy and slow, with the audio rarely correctly syncing with the video.  The stream is not HD (I'd say barely 480).  Additionally, if you read the fine print, there is an ambiguous statement that may indicate your access to the digital copy will terminate sometime in 2013.  But 4/5 stars for the good movie, and the DVD and Blu-ray discs themselves are great.
B004LUS390|5.0|This application is more fun and sophisticated than I expected. I'm not really a great artist, but it's still fun to play with.

Jax now has the ultimate decision to make between the women and the club.  I suspect Jax will shake off the citizen mentality and remember that even though Gema and Tara are the two most important females in his life, they are, after all, \\"just ole ladies\\".  I don't expect that this season will tie up all the lose ends and I don't believe that Clay will leave the show.  Gema will not allow her dysfunctional \\"family\\" to seperate.  Looking forward to next week!

0545265355|5.0|When I began reading the Hunger Game Trilogy, I did not realize it was written for young adults. That didn't stop me though because I was hooked early on. It is a blend of an apocolyptic vision of what the United States might become and what Ancient Rome really was. The blend was so skillful that I am only glad that I picked it up right before I went on vacation because I stayed up late, late every night hungry for more.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This was an informative, well done video with a good message.  I felt like they spent a little too much time on the story about the kid who died from Ecoli.  I'm not being insensitive to that situation or his family, I just think it killed the energetic, fast paced mood of the movie that was keeping us enthralled and making us feel like we were learning something big every 5 minutes.  I also feel like there needed to be a message near the end about the real solution being to keep things small and local.  This is the key to avoiding control by big companies and government.  They can't keep backyard gardeners from saving seed and growing organic.<br /><br />- Matthew's Review

B004EBZX6W|5.0|I didn't actually think I would use this much, but I find myself using it to check the internet connections around me all the time, even if I am pretty sure I have the strongest connection already. I like that it has different ways to illustrate signal strength.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I recently purchased 5 of the Princess giant wall decals. Each have a NAME decal in their packaging.  Aurora, Ariel, Cinderella and Belle.  All EXCEPT for Tiana! It is very noticeable.  Why is there no name decal for this princess? I would like to have the name decal for Tiana so that I can complete the wall.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This is my first Beyonce concert DVD. I was blown away by her vocals (alone) during this concert. I think the personal footage was a nice little addition, and it gave even more meaning to the different songs she was performing. The is a good buy. I also enjoyed the video anthology, it gives you all of her videos from 4 and behind the scenes of the video. I am never disappointed w/ her work. Amazing DVD!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Love it, all of it, just what I wanted for soooo long. Don´t get caught by reviewers who haven´t purchase it yet, this box set is a great must have!
B005TQAI6G|2.0|When I first learned that Britney was going to tour, I got myself pumped to shell out big dollars to see the Femme Fatale tour because I figured she'd put on a great show. I had saw Beyonce, U2, Janet Jackson and several other major music concerts around the same time as Britney was touring and I just had to add Britney to my list. What I didn't know was that to sit in almost an identical location for the Femme Fatale concert as I did at Beyonce's  I Am tour, the Femme Fatale price was significantly higher, as in another minimum $100. So I decided if I can't get good seats, I won't go. So for months, I'm trapped in DVD Land, patiently waiting and hoping that the Femme Fatale concert will become available on DVD. I became a Britney Femme Fatale DVD Stalker. Guess what? Now only was it available on DVD, it was available in Blu-ray! Talk about being frantic, I quickly pre-ordered the Femme Fatale Blu-ray and waited for it to arrive. Then I read a few comments about Britney lip syncing and after some thought, I changed the Blu-ray to DVD.  The DVD came yesterday and I rushed home, turned on the big HDEF TV, kicked up the surround sound, made popcorn, turned off all of the lights because I knew that this concert was going to be fierce and I wanted to \\"live\\" in it. Well, all I can write is that I'VE BEEN HAD! I'VE BEEN TOOK! LED ASTRAY! RUN AMUCK! HOODWINKED! BAMBOOZLED! Here's a quick listing of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Femme Fatale DVD:  1. Good -  Britney's backup dancers were really good, especially the men. The choreography was good, not mind-blowing, but good. Oh yeah, the theatrics were pretty good too;  2. Bad - Britney herself, didn't bring the crisp, unbelievable dancing. She was dancing like she was dog-tired, and from what? Definitely not from singing and dancing simultaneously!  3. Ugly - Britney  lip synced approximately 90% of her songs.  I fell asleep TWICE, woke up and watched the songs that I missed. I'm glad I didn't shell out $$$ to see lip syncing in a live concert. I figure, if Madonna, who is like 52 years old and Beyonce and Shakira who are in the same age bracket as Britney can all sing and dance their mudda-shut-your-mouth tails off in their concerts then if Britney is lip syncing, her dance moves should in the least be slammin'.  After watching Femme Fatale one time, I thought it was uneventful, quite dull and thought to myself, hmm, I should have watched Lady Gaga first. Still, I favor Britney. She comes off during the concert as a very appreciative and nice person and also because I'm glad that she appears to have pulled herself together after the drama from a few years ago, I will watch Femme Fatal again - but probably after watching the Lady Gaga Monster Tour.
B000J6I0PM|4.0|A great \\"Unplugged\\" version of the Foo's live show...After viewing this release, you get a great idea that these guys are really evolving into a fantastic band, expanding their musicianship to another level.  A very enjoyable show....Highly recommended!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly. I use the music on my Kindle instead of a regular alarm or ringtone, and it can get pretty loud. It does run in the background after you set an alarm, so I recommend setting it before you sleep and keeping it plugged in so it doesn't run the battery down as fast.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I think Elf is a new classic, at least it is in my house. The movie has a great balance of heart and humor. Will Ferrell is funny even though not in his usual Will Ferrell way.<br /><br />The DVD is promoted as the Infinifilm edition. I find the DVD set up to be annoying. There are two ways to view the DVD extras. You can play them one by one which can be annoying when the extra only lasts a few seconds, or you can have the scenes play throughout the movie where the interrupt the movie to show you a little extra about the scene you just watched or insert a extra scene, which is even more annoying.<br /><br />Infinifilm was trying to be innovative but instead they made it a little too complicated.
0739383264|2.0|REVIEW OF AUDIO CD: Not as good as earlier books, but still entertaining. However, Rosalyn Landor was a terrible choice as reader. She makes Becky sound like she's in her 40's, and all the male characters have the exact same old man voice. Made me dread hearing it.   I stopped reading mid book out of boredom... Dragged on. Same old predicaments she gets in.
B004EPYZTE|2.0|Ok, here's some perspective on where I come from with this whole Conan thing. The 1982 film has a special place in my heart. Always has and always will. It's slow and artsy, also powerful. Growing up a young angry man, Arnold's Conan helped mold my character. I'm not joking, I loved that movie. The Destroyer was bad. Familiar faces were nice but it was ultimately a joke. I had read some paperbacks-none of the original works so my understanding of the source material is limited. But the original movie you could tell was made with so much love and dedication, it was a beautiful film. The revenge story, the evolution from a boy to a man, it was all so inspiring to me as a kid. When the new movie was announced I was reserved in my excitement, although my inner child was screaming with anticipation. This was despite the consistent warnings of childhood friends who panned the new re-imagining as a cash grab. I waited, heard some awful reviews, but then again the original had some bad reviews as well. Then I saw the Conan O'brian interview with the lead (momoa)and thought to myself what a likable chap. And he kind of looks like REH's Conan to boot. The other day I almost bought the blue-ray at Target but fortunately passed on it. I ended up ordering it ondemand. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it. It's sooo bad. The birth of Conan on the battlefield was so unintentionally funny, I actually can say that it was my favorite part of the movie but for the wrong reasons. The rest was forgettable and I fell asleep before the end. It's like an episode of Xena on roids. Shame. The lead wasn't bad, but he wasn't good enough to save this hunk of crap movie. I think I'll be buying the original on blue-ray, my respect for that movie has been resurrected.
0451232577|5.0|This book is underrated. No great artist should ever stay the same.  Frank Lloyd Wright explored different styles, Picasso had various themes, and now so too does Ken Follett.    For any lover of history and admirer of the human condition in all of if forms, this book is a great psychological study that is very relevant to our own times of normal everyday people trying to life their lives as best they came but are surrounded by government mismanagement and idealists.  I look forward to volume 2!
0439813786|5.0|If you haven't read this book, by all means get it and read it! Brian Selznik tells a wonderful story through his writing and through his illustrations, which I must say are remarkable drawings. This author is extremely talented! He brings the words and pictures to life.<br /><br />Hugo found a place in my heart right from the start. The mother in me wanted to take him in under my wing. Hugo is a brave boy who does what he needs to survive. He is driven to rebuild a automaton that his deceased father was trying to rebuild at the time of his death. I found the idea of the automaton quite fascinating.<br /><br />Hugo lives in a secret world behind the scenes which adds to the mystery in the book. All of the characters in the book are well developed and to me all had a bit of quirkiness about them.<br /><br />My thoughts cannot do this book justice. The format is unusual and works well with the storyline. I cannot imagine this story being told any other way. It is not only a great story but a work of art! Trust me, this is a book the whole family will enjoy.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing how the story translates to the big screen! I hope the movie is as wonderful as the book!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This case is simply beautiful. It's a bit more red than I thought from the pictures, but that's a good thing. I love that my Fire fits snugly with no risk of slipping out. The case is extremely stiff, which is great protection plus it allows me to stand it up on a flat surface when I want to read or surf the internet horizontal-style. Plus it smells great!
B000IHY9SE|5.0|Ca$his and a bunch of other rappers go super hard in this! Amazing mix tape with a plethora of people...I also think that eminem is the one that drew the cover which is pretty bad a**
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Oh man, this show has it all. Have you ever watched a scary show or movie & been screaming at the characters, \\"what in the hell are you doing man! Don't go off in the dark alone! Don't leave your gun! Moron!!!\\" Well, this is one of the very first shows where I see people making decisions similar or identical to the ones I would make in the event of a zombie apocolypse. Sounds corny but it is a great show! I think probably my favorite show I've seen in years!

0399226907|5.0|This childrens book is a classic, I remember reading it 12+ years ago in grade school. Now I have bought it for a niece of mine in hopes that she enjoys it as much as I have.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great! I love it! It works as described. Nice to be able to wake to music/artist that I choose.
B0013V33DG|3.0|I agree with Stanley Nemeth's review - the hyperactive stage business becomes exhausting. As other reviewers have noted this actually spoils what I suspect could have been vocally a near perfect performance.  In the opera house the effect was not nearly so irritating -I saw the 2010  Covent Garden version-as it is on DVD, where the closeups intensify the clowning.  But the main problem I think was that Dessay's characterisation of Marie, dramatically effective though it was,  came at the expense of her vocal technique.  Screaming and squawking may have been in character as conceived by Pelly, but I don't think it has any place in bel canto.  Tragic opera can accommodate a few sobs by the dying, and laughs which are cascading arpeggios are standard in comic opera- though not in the score- but actually distorting the music is over the top.  We had to wait almost halfway through the opera to hear some beautiful phrasing from Dessay, and a much richer tone in 'Il faut partir' though even there her pianissimi were sometimes inaudible. Florez was his usual confident self,  and Campanella's direction elegant.    It's a great pity that Pelly couldnt allow Dessay some vocal respite, or let Donizetti's score speak for itself.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love the games and all the choices ... keep them coming! thanks for all your hard work.  Background and card choices too
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Buble' came back and followed up last years slight Christmas offering with this full 15 song CD and it's terrific. The man has the smoothest voice in music these days, and each selection is traditional and wonderful. Outstanding is his gorgeous version of Ave Maria, a beautiful and heartfelt I'll Be Home For Christmas, and a jazzy nod to Elvis on Blue Christmas. I could do without the amped up, sped up,trumped up White Christmas with Shania Twain, the version on last years CD with his fanatastic voice is wonderful, this was unnecessary. A small criticsm of a terrific Christmas album.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|If enough people stop buying this so called Ultraviolet crap (which is basicly a streaming online video that you can't even download or watch on ipads) they'll be forced to change this scam, if people keep buying they won't!   So be smart, and force Warner Bros to release the dvd/bluray on disc at the time of this release!
B00007DWRA|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus demonstrates the powerful and wonderful impact we can have on the lives of those around us when we combine our own passion with compassion for others. Mr. Holland's Opus follows the career of a teacher of music appreciation named Glen Holland, and all of the lives he touches and inspires with his passion for music. While the movie has its ups and downs, and a wealth of poignant moments, the big emotional payoff comes at the end when Mr. Holland's literal opus meets his metaphorical opus in beautiful harmony.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is great despite the ads between games. you can get right past them without much problem. I would recommend to anyone.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Country Strong soundtrack is awesome! I loved the movie and I loved the music! I'm a big fan of country so it is a great CD to play in the car!
B00192IV9U|2.0|There is much controversy over the songs on this album, but the reason I say it isn't a Michael Jackson album is because it doesn't feel like one. He had no control over this (obviously, since it's post-mortem), but he would have NEVER allowed this collection of songs to be released. As a true artist, Michael was obsessive over what he created. Nothing was released half-finished or until he felt like it was exactly the way he wanted it. He would scrap entire songs and start over if they weren't turning out as he envisioned them. This album feels unfinished and less than perfect.<br /><br />As far as the controversy over some of the tracks, I do not believe \\"Keep Your Head Up,\\" \\"Monster,\\" or \\"Breaking News\\" were sung by Michael Jackson. Pretty much his entire family has come forward saying it isn't him singing. Maybe parts of the vocals are, but they seem to be mixed in with someone else's vocals. If they are, as some suggest, demo versions that were poorly recorded and then fleshed out in production after his death, that is enough evidence that they should not have been included on this album. Michael would turn over in his grave if he knew anything subpar was being released under his name.<br /><br />I am rating this 2/5 stars, because there are some good songs on here. Unfortunately, the bad/fake songs create so much disdain for the album that I can't truly enjoy listening to them. It's sad what his estate is willing to do for money, especially considering how much they have made since his death off of other products.<br /><br />FYI, one of my friends wound up giving me this CD as a present, otherwise I wouldn't have it in my possession. I just couldn't bring myself to buy it.
B005FVFWOI|4.0|I just received the 2 CD version. Although I think it's a sonic improvement over the original CD version, it's louder. I had to turn the volume down on the remaster to level match the two versions. For the sake of full disclosure, both are ripped directly from the CD to lossless in iTunes.   The irony is, in the liner notes, Steve Wilson himself states specifically that he didn't raise the levels. So that part was a disappointment to me.   All said I feel the remaster (remix) is a step up in sonics and clarity plus an overall improvement. I'd give it 4.5 stars out of 5 because of the loudness.
1451648537|4.0|i must say that the two books I bought were meant as Christmas presents but my friend find this book before in my office so I had to give him it before. But it was worth because I made him happy 1 month earlier :)
B005GUQYIQ|5.0|I have enjoyed Simon's Cat for years. I recently introduced the school librarian to the books by sharing my copies with her. She had so many requests by students wanting to check them out that she bought copies for the school library. Cute, witty, and true to cat form!

B002ECJZ76|4.0|I really liked the movie.  It's quite dated and you have to get used to it being dubbed in English but after a while, I didn't really notice it.  I thought it to be a very plausible beginning for the St. Nick legend.  We enjoyed it very much.
B001HN6922|5.0|I bought this movie for my son's 5th birthday and he loves it. We had seen it in the theater first and he fell in love with it. It is a cute family movie especially if you have seen the 1st movie. This one focuses a bit more on Mater which is fun :) Overall the entire family likes the movie and recommend it!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This was my FIRST time buying DVDs from Amazon I was like hey it's Black Friday and it's a good deal. I get the DVD and I open it to find 3 DVDs one for the BluRay, another for the computer and another regular DVD. I can give the other two I dont use to my sister. It's like I got a three for one!!
B005P78VK4|3.0|I saw this on one of amazon's lightning deals during black friday week.  I didn't know the cd existed, and was actually pretty excited about it after listening to a lot of the 30 second clips for the songs on the CD.  Based off of these....I thought many of Jackson's songs sounded like they were recreated well, and had enjoyable changes. I'm disappointed after getting the CD to find out that this isn't quite the case with the full songs -- and really for the most part -- none of them stand out as must haves over the originals. I probably would have passed on this item had I known better.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|For three of four years now, people have been telling me to read this book, and I always told them I might. But once I saw the movie trailer (which was amazing), I decided to finally read The Hunger Games. Too bad everything everyone told me about this book is extremely false, and makes me wonder about my friends' intelligence.  Pros:  -Very interesting story idea  -Imaginative world  -Decent character development  Cons:  -Written in first person, so it automatically creates two flaws: 1. Obviously the main character will survive, because she's telling the story. So if she dies, the book would just end. 2. There are so many interesting things happening in the arena, but we can't see them because its told from one person's point of view, and unfortunately, this person, Katniss, is not doing anything all that interesting.  -Written horribly. This is the only Suzanne Collins book I can remember reading, so I don't know if she is always a bad writer, or if its just with this book, but the writing was so awful, I just wanted to throw my Kindle against the wall. This \\"book\\" feels more like a rough draft. Everything seemed like the beginning of an idea, not a fully thought-out story.  -The story seemed like it should play out like an action story, but turns out to be a really awkward and uncomfortable love story.  -All the main character does is whine  -The premise of the story makes you think there will be a lot of action, but it is all avoided in very cheap ways. (Spoiler alert): When you think Katniss is going to have to kill Peeta, a voice comes over the speakers announcing a rule change that says they can both live if they're the last two standing. It completely eliminated the main conflict and the most suspenseful and interesting part of the story. Also, at the end, when you think they're about to have an epic battle with Cato, these things called \\"Mutts\\" come and take care of Cato for them (basically). Oh yeah, and the Mutts were weird and kind of stupid.  -Bad ending.  Overall:  Unless you really want to read the book before you see the movie, go for it. But if you don't really want to waste your money, I'd say just wait for the movie. Just the trailer alone is better than this book.  To all you strong followers of this book:  Before you start posting hate comments like crazy, or get your feelings hurt over this review, I want you to know that its just one person's opinion. If you love this book, so be it. But your life isn't ruined because of it.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This light is the bomb, as my nephews would put it.  Far outshines anything I own , nice size to get a good grip on it. Like that it has 4 brightness levels , works out great on those late night dog walks, use turbo for looking for animals up ahead. Using alkaline aa, but definitely going to get some rechargables. Didn't expect it to come in a fancy little case,  bonus.  All in all would by another one of these or at least more of their product

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I bought this product with the sole intent of watching Netflix streaming video on televisions while I was traveling.<br /><br />In short, this product is awesome and suited my needs perfectly.  It outputs a 1080p signal and high quality sound, that are both crisp and clean.  I've used this product on televisions ranging from 32\\" to 73\\" and have never been disappointed with it's image quality.  Please note that your ipad will not show the video, just a static screen, while you are watching Netflix.<br /><br />Also, my wife and I have happened upon additional benefits during our search for a new house in that not only 'video' programs will output to a tv.  As such, when I browse the internet to look for houses, she can sit on the couch and still see the next great living room, without peering over my shoulder.  Its also great for putting a slideshow with music on your television (think wedding montage of kids or whatever theme for a party).<br /><br />You may also want to spend a few bucks on a really long HDMI cable, so you don't have to stand next to your tv while you browse or leave your ipad propped up by the tv while you stream video...I have a 15 ft cable that I keep with me and it's always been long enough to get things done.

B000059MEK|5.0|Known for their French-styled House music as well as Dance/Electronica music with unique, live performances that include various visual effects,  are an electronic music duo formed in 1993 that includes French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The French duo started getting attention during House movement in late 1990s with their innovative style and became popular worldwide with their debut album Homework, which was released in 1997. Daft Punk's second studio album released in March 2001, Discovery turned out to be a bigger hit and has major hit tracks such as \\"Digital Love\\", \\"One More Time\\", and \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\". In the album, Daft Punk effectively incorporates a wide range of styles and samples, while creating a pop-culture mix of funky music.          The duo Daft Punk was largely influenced from musical works by the The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, and Elton John. In their works, Daft Punk often use disco techniques from various musicians such as electronic music giant , and have created one of the most unique house beats in modern pop-culture history.  According to the artist himself, de Homem-Christo usually plays the guitar while Bangalter performs on keyboards or bass guitar. The duo's ability to play multiple instruments adds dynamic element to the 7-time Grammy award nominees and 2-time Grammy award winning group.         Discovery is distinctively different from the previous album. Homework is often described as a \\"party\\" album that has fun and energetic songs. Even though the album does not have heavy-disco element to it, it certainly elevates listeners' energy with its combination of dance beats with electronic and funky music. Discovery, on the other hand, accounts for unique synthpop-oriented style and focuses on reconnecting with lively childhood memories as it features many samples from the late 1970's and 80's music. At its peak, the album gained popularity as it took the number two spot in Britishmainstream music.        The first single of the album, \\"One More Time\\", was released on November 13th, 2000. The song highly features a heavy auto-tuned and compressed vocal performance sung by an American producer . With frequent alterations using Auto-Tune, Romanthony heightens the electronic element that is blended with the funkiness of the music. The song was a huge success by the French Duo. In addition to accomplishment in the United Kingdom in 2000, \\"One More Time\\" was one of Daft Punk's few charting songs in the United States, reaching number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. Recently, the song was featured in the Wii video game Boogie and PlayStation 3's SingStar.    The third single from the album, \\"Digital Love\\", was another homerun by the French duo. It was so popular that the song was featured in the film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, a Japanese animated musical film released in 2003. During production, a Puerto Rican musician DJ Sneak composed the lyrics that were performed by Daft Punk. \\"Digital Love\\" is known for the guitar solo performed by Bangalter, who admitted using music sequencers in the making. The song gained popularity worldwide, as it charted 14th place on the UK Singles Chart and made number nine on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the United States.      Another hit in the album, \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" also features heavy, robotic, auto-tuned vocals, and it contains a sample of \\"Cola Bottle Baby\\" by Edwin Birdsong. The song was remixed by Kanye West, who used a vocal sample from the original and named his new track \\"Stronger.\\" The remixed version also received high praise as it won a Grammy Award at the 50th Grammy Awards, where Daft Punk made a surprise appearance to congratulate West.    In addition to \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,\\" a couple of other tracks from the album were sampled by other musicians. Wiley's song \\"Summertime\\" from the album See Clear Now includes a sample of \\"Aerodynamic.\\" Also, Jazmine Sullivan's song \\"Dream Big\\" from the album Fearless features a part of \\"Veridis Quo.\\"         Throughout the album, there are many samples from the early works by other musicians. Instead of making new music using those samples, Daft Punk simply edited them by adding new instrumental performance. In their second studio album, the French duo did what they do best by creating French disco house music that captured millions of people's attention over the world. Overall, the album has gained global recognition as manifested in sales and charts. In 2005, it was estimated that Discovery has sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005. Furthermore, Rhapsody ranked the album at number 12 on its \\"100 Best Albums of the Decade\\" list in 2009.

B004QYTRRS|5.0|The Tourist is a refreshing reminder of what great film-making is all about. I felt thoroughly captivated as soon as I started watching, as if a magic wand kept me glued to the screen. Jolie's presence was mesmerizing, projecting an uncanny combination of beauty, delicacy, fragility, elegance and femininity, in a way that is rarely seen on the screen (big or small), and combined with Depp's purity of presence and genuineness, there were some magical moments forming between them that are true cinematic gems.   The genius of the director is felt every step of the way, and if you prefer a genuine interaction between people (and some riveting action scenes) over a parade of special effects, you are in for a rare treat.

Harriet Ketchum, the lady in the store who tells the cashier to give the child her twenty dollar bill back, was my drama teacher for four years.  Dr. Coder, the manager of the store, was a professor on campus.  Other extras were well-known in the Hays community.  I also recognized many of the buidlings and sites shown.  Thus, I liked the film before ever seeing it.    That aside, the movie is interesting for several reasons.  First, filmed in black and white, it more truly depicts the depressed era of the \\"dirty 30s\\" on the Great Plains, when dust storms moved the soil at will.  Second, the development of the relationship between two unlikely characters, Mose and Addie, was well-written, well-directed, and convincingly acted by Ryan and Tatum Oneal.  Madeline Kahn is her usual brilliant self as Trixie Delight.      Addie learns quickly and even teaches con-man Mose a few new wrinkles in his taking advantage of people.  But Addie, wise for her age, knows when doing so is not appropriate and manages the situation.  Addie does not like Trixie and hatches a plan to get her away from Mose.  On their travels across Kansas and into Missouri, the two meet up with moonshiners, lawmen, and other notable characters.      It's all good fun.  Even if I didn't have personal reasons for liking it, I would recommend it highly.  It's a film to enjoy over and over again.

B005IGVYUG|5.0|I can understand why some people wouldn't like this album. But, they probably just don't like it because they're prejudiced - they only like GOOD music. Hey, if they want to go through life listening to music with interesting chord progressions, good melodies and good vocal performances, more power to them.  But there's more music in the world than just the good kind. Those who venture beyond the realm of talent and competence want something different. We want music with melodies that go nowhere, sung by a man who sounds like his vocal chords were removed and replaced with a wounded weasel. We want music that assaults our ears and makes our sphincters clench up good and tight. We want music that SUCKS. And for nearly 40 years, Tom Waits has given us what we want.  This CD is meant to be appreciated by people who like music that sucks. If you hate music that sucks, go elsewhere, please. But if you want music that has no redeeming value at all, you'll love this CD.  Christmas is coming, so be sure to buy a few of these for the fans of sucky music on your shopping list. When they hear how totally and completely this sucks, their minds will be blown!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on my ipod touch. It is such a great way to waste time. Tons of fun.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I received it yesterday and immediately noticed the size, it is the size of a carry on luggage.  With that said, the the interior of the case is well done.  Your gaming system is held securely in place with straps which have foam to protect your gaming system.  The monitor is excellent with great picture quality.  The speakers are good with lots of volume.  The only drawback to the System is that there is not a lot of room to transport games inside the unit.  I was able to secure the hardware used for the Xbox 360 along with 1 controller,  I'm sure that if I would have taken more time I could have placed 2 controllers in the supplied storage bags.  Overall this is a great unit to transport and play your gaming system and would highly recommend it.
0735327793|5.0|This is a well-made, very cute, very fun puzzle. My daughter is not quite three, and she has been delighted with this puzzle since grandma gave it to her two months ago. She LOVES the fruit and the caterpillar, and she even likes to carry the pieces around in the box. The box is also very cute and durable.<br /><br />It's not indestructible (my daughter chewed a knob off one of the pieces), but most normal messes and spills have wiped off the puzzle surprisingly well. All in all, this is a terrific product.
B0000029AP|5.0|The year 1975, was the year I woke up and discovered the beauty and the power of progressive and album rock. My aunt introduced me to album rock while I was still listening to Casey Kasem's American Top 40. That changed my life (nearly) forever when I suddenly discovered ELO, ELP, Robin Trower, Aerosmith, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, and the such. I stopped buying 45's and I started buying 8-track tapes, and then vinyl LP's. Albums of the Immortal Gods of Rock Music.<br /><br />WDRQ FM 93 in Detroit played a great mix of current Top 40 music, mixed with pop from the late sixties to the current time of the summer of 1975. I could never imagine that radio could ever be better. Then when I started listening to WRIF and WABX, I heard more than just songs from artists that I heard the hits of, I started to hear other tracks from these artists that were simply just extra songs from their current new album, and from some previously released albums.<br /><br />I could give you many examples from so many great albums from 1975, but I'll just stick to how this album \\"Toys in The Attic\\" by Aerosmith moved me. 101 WRIF FM was playing songs I never heard of from some bands that I did know. When I started listen to FM radio, I heard them play \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\".  I believe I heard them on the pop radio stations too.  Even AM radio.  But, then I heard songs like \\"Adam's Apple\\", \\"No More, No More\\", and even the title track of this Aerosmith album.  I suddenly began to have the courage to invest in buying a whole album of just one artist instead of the albums like I use to buy.  You know, K-Tel albums that had 22 shortened singles of current pop radio hits.  When I started listening to all these Aerosmith songs playing on the radio, I felt like I was familiar with half the album already.  FM radio in Detroit really knew how to promote and sell an album. And so at this time, I started to buy albums, even though I haven't bought a record player yet.  OK, I'll be honest.  I was buying 8-track tapes.  Ungodly, 8 track tapes! I've never bought a whole album before (well, except \\"Elton John's Greatest Hits), and after a while, these songs started disappearing from the radio format as newer songs were entering the \\"album rock\\" arena through the summer of 1975.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't have a stereo yet so I went over to see my cool aunt (who loves to rock), and asked her if she ever heard of Aerosmith. She then asked me: \\"Where have you been?\\". She had the album of \\"Toys In The Attic\\" and she did have a turntable, an amp, and two huge speakers in her bedroom. She had an awesome stereo (something I never heard before either). She put on this album for me. My eyes teared up at what I was hearing. I listened to the whole album. So, for my love for music at 14 years of age, I knew that I had to get out there and start cutting people's grass, washing people's cars, and what ever little odd jobs I could get for myself so that I can get myself a real stereo. My little Panasonic AM radio just wasn't enough for me anymore. I had to get my own stereo. Plus, I got myself a real job. I started washing dishes in an Italian restaurant and as time went on, by first snow, I was taught how to make pizza. This got me to make more money, and got me to buy my first stereo just before Christmas. My parents would never buy me a stereo. I always knew that.<br /><br />When I got my first stereo, it had an FM band. So, I started to listen to FM stereo in my room on my days off after school. And about this time, I started hearing hits and non-hits from ELO, ELP, Robin Trower, Aerosmith, Yes, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Queen, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, and the such. My life changed forever! About a year later, I finally bought my own amplified stereo, with an FM band. And what I loved about FM radio was that the DJ explained what artists they were playing and which album their songs came from. FM DJ's talked differently than AM radio DJ's did. They were more personal about the music. And more relaxed and mature. I loved that! While heading into 1976, with my new stereo, I started buying vinyl LP's practically every weekend.<br /><br />I know this review was more about a reminiscence of the era of when this album was released, but I wonder if other people had a similar experience as a kid who discovered album rock in this way. I'd really like to read your story. You can read more about my experiences of the introduction of progressive and album rock if you read my reviews on the Yes albums \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"The Yes Album\\". And albums from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and Strawbs, and Jean Michel Jarre. These albums were also part of my transition to the love of the Immortal Gods of Rock.ic. And more relaxed and mature.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I use it for a year without any problem....for run and for bikes...it is fast to find gps signals and the built in battery supports long rides..recomended
B004O3YGMC|5.0|That is amazing software. Now I can access all data, media ... etc. in my PC from my portable Kindle Fire device.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I love this album. As a huge BFMV fan i would like to say that this album is definitely worth buying. You won't be disappointed.
B005TTEFRG|2.0|I like the original Arnold Schwarzennegger's \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" better because the original had a simpler story, which is easier to follow, and it even possessed a pleasant level of humor where even just a little bad acting adds to the humor of the original film.<br /><br />Jason Momoa was a pretty good casting for the role of Conan, but I think he was just too much of a \\"pretty boy\\" for this role.  He would have been better placed in the 1984 film of \\"Conan the Destroyer\\" which, to me, plays more like a campy soft porn fantasy, but without any actual porn. \\"Conan the Destroyer\\" was just a bunch of pansy acting and was a truly unworthy sequel to the original. I'm sure even Arnold regrets that film too.<br /><br />Plus, I really appreciated what Sandahl Bergman as Valeria brought to the screen of the original 1982 version.  I wasn't too impressed with Rachel Nichols as Tamara in this new film.  She's OK, but she's no where's near as attractive or as \\"exciting\\" on the big screen as Sandahl Bergman was. She was a \\"goddess\\" to me in the original film.<br /><br />Even the scene with the Witch portrayed by Cassandra Gava added a bit of sexy campiness to the original 1982 film.<br /><br />Plus, the original 1982 version of Conan had the powerful presence of James Earl Jones, and the dry wit, but mystical and mysterious performance of Mako as the Wizard.  All the characters in the original film showed powerful performances, but yet it was all a simplified enjoyable Saturday matinee experience. This new version had too many screen consuming added effects which makes all of the film seem to have too much irrelevance only to make the visuals more aggressive for the eyes. I like cool visuals, but I still want a simpler story to follow.<br /><br />I'd watch this film again, sooner than I would watch Schwarzenegger's 1984 film \\"Conan the Destroyer\\", but as a film to own, I wouldn't watch either one ever again, so I wouldn't buy it either.  I'll cherish the 1982 Blu-Ray of \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" as the only Conan film that I'd ever keep in my library of films.ever keep in my library of films.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I usally like Lee Child for a nice quick read and decent page-turnability. But for me, this one seemed to plod it's way through a morass from one non event to the next. Overall, a decent read, but not the most exciting.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app met my expectations and then some. I wanted a calendar app for the Fire to sync with my Google calanders. This app not only does that with a great look and feel similar to Google calendar itself, but it's also very customizable, works with gtasks, and works offline. Excellent.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I have just finished this book and this is the first review I have ever written for anything.  Stephen King is a genius storyteller. I have read many of his books and loved every one I read.  This book, for me, was one of the best books I have ever read, and I read constantly.  His descritpions are spot on, when he writes you feel that you are the main character.  The sotryline was fantastic and I hope to see this book made into a movie, probably not too long into the future.  If you are thinking of buying this book - stop thinking and do it, there will be no regrets - or maybe just one, when you finish it!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This is so bad.  Lou Reed garbles and drones meaningless uninspiring words over sloppy and lazy sounding Metallica.  I have never been less impressed by anything Metallica has ever done by a long shot.  Horrible.  Don't waste your money.  Death Magnetic in contrast was a brilliant release.  I look forward to them getting focused on their own music again.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Was unsure about this until I opened the box. Even though it came in a different color (black with orange), it is rugged and strong.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this mahjong app has good graphics and hard enough for a challenge.  I would recommend this app. needs more levels.
B005DTEUAE|2.0|I've purchased the MP3 download and thought to wait for the vinyl press so get the quality that I want. The album is fantastic.  But at $33+ for a double record? You've got to be kidding me! I've been paying $16 on the average for records from here and some of them include the CD version as well!  While I'd like to see more of a comeback for vinyl releases, at this price I'm not holding my breath...nor my wallet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun and fast paced, keeps you hooked.  fun for any age with lots of options to change it up any time you want
6304712944|2.0|The case in which the DVD is enclosed was falling apart when delevered. VERY cheap packaging! Not at all \\"collectors\\" quality. I will need to purchase a new case and try to put the printed paper into a new case, thus ruining any potential \\"collector\\" status.
0446585025|4.0|Very funny did not disappoint. Alot of the writing is from her monologues so you feel you have already heard most of it if you are an avid watcher of her show like me. Even then it was still funny to me and her personality comes through the pages. She always makes me laugh with the way she views different scenarios and life :)
0375851569|2.0|Dr. Seuss is of course great.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed with the quality of this printing.  The paper is of low quality, which results in the illustrations from one page showing through onto the next, ruining the whole effect at least for me.  I suppose I'll need to buy used copies of older editions of these works to experience them for the artistic masterpieces they are.  Too bad.

0446547654|3.0|ugh...where to begin?  wonderful love story like always from Nicholas Sparks but so much anguish.  I didn't feel that I FELT them fall in love.  There does not seem to be enough history for us to really feel they were in love in my opinion.  Real life problems and heart break.
B00138J7V6|5.0|Can't give this album anything less than 5 stars, especially the stripped version. Unbelievable talent, vocal and writing. Nuff said, will never stop listening to this album.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Wow!!! I am speechless! I have purchased many remastered discs of some of my favorite music but I have never ever heard a difference like this. I listened to the first disc on headphones and was totally blown away at what I heard. There were nuances I had never picked up on before. It really made me fall in love with this album all over again. It was already a classic, but this remastering made it so much better than I could ever have expected. Finally, someone took the time to do it right. I cannot recommend this highly enough nor are there enough stars to rate it as high as it deserves. THIS is rock and roll royalty!
B003CTFEAC|4.0|My daughter loves this toy!!!!!!!!. It has survived rough play and keeps its beauty. Couldn't be more pleased with the item.
B005QF0GIK|5.0|\\"Weather\\" is moody, smooth, blue and beautiful.  Cohesive and whole.  There are flavorings of earlier albums (Bitter, in particular, but something of Peace Beyond Passion and Devil's Halo here and there), but it's no clone of anything she's done before.  It's remarkably beautiful, actually.  I admire Me'Shell's work, in all it's manifestations, but this may be her masterpiece.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this transmitter in a last ditch attempt to use my IPod Touch in my 97 Ford Explorer. I've tried using the tape adapter in the past and couldn't stand the sound quality, I've tried some of the higher end transmitters and was a fool to think that because it costs more that it would perform better. This transmitter really impressed me, sound quality, features, and functionality.The only thing I didn't like was the audio cable that came with it, it feels a little flimsy, but it works. I highly recommend this transmitter!
B005N95JA4|5.0|I remembering hearing on 2JJ FM a rock radio station in Sydney that Bon Scott of AC/DC sang back ups on \\"When the Whip Comes DOWN!\\" I must say that it sounds like his voice to me. So all you Rockin'boys and Girls have a listen and let your ears see. Is it Aussie boy Bon Scott?It is a great record and all those unrealeased tracks, Oh Boy! Ya gotta love the Rolling Stones. Ronnie Wood and Keith let him.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Both the French and German Amazon site have the 3d Blu-Ray edition to be release in February 2012 , One has the 9th, the other has the 15th.
0385534639|2.0|It is so wordy, and not in a good way.  It was unnecessary and distracting and boring and make you have to re-read a sentence a few time since it's so wordy and you think \\"there's gotta be something important in that paragraph\\", but no.  I plundered through anyway since it has all these great reviews. This book could have been so much more.  A lot more could have gone into Alexander's past.  If this was written by a Young Adult author, the paranormal would be mind blowing and the romance amazing.  Instead, it's a book for adult that describe a magical circus that happens to have people involved.
098357670X|5.0|I've enjoyed the art so much, I've had a hard time taking the time to actually read the text. Tom's art is incredible and worth the price of the book alone.<br /><br />My wife, who's not an artist, looks at it every time she walks by. My kids keep picking it up and I found one of them drawing from it the other day. How many books have you seen that inspire so many people? This one does.<br /><br />For the artist and non-artist alike. I've bought many for gifts.
B001OB7F98|5.0|Bjork's Post is an album that mixes various musical styles but is largely built on the electronic-pop of the first album. Probably the most defining aspect of this album is it's use of technology in producing the sounds and textures prevalent throughout. This is done in various ways on different tracks and can be seen especially in the songs \\"Army of Me\\" and \\"Isobel.\\"  \\"Army of Me\\" is the first song on the album and immediately propels the listener into Bjork's musical world. The song is loud and powerful, making it a jarring introduction to the album. Exceptional use of technology helps it to achieve this sound. From the first note the song makes use of sound effects and electronic instruments. The song lyrics are meant to be arousing and provocative, almost sounding angry. The music fits this mood very well. The consistent low drone of the base line in combination with the decrescendos of electronic sound serve this purpose well. It is a very good song that introduces the type of instrumentation that will be used throughout the album but is still very unique in it's composition.  \\"Isobel\\" is a song further along in the album that expertly employs the use of technology in a very different way than in \\"Army of Me.\\" \\"Isobel\\" can best be described as more low-key and disquieting than other songs on the album. At the start, it sounds as if it is going to be a more classically based song but then shifts with a repetitive drum beat and various electronic instruments, including some sort of synthesizer and keyboard. These sounds add a beautiful sound that is somewhat disquieting, dark feel. This goes well with the lyrics involving nature and a woman isolated from the world. This song does well to complement the album, doing well to mix modern technological sounds with an outdoorsy drum beat and more classical strings.  Bjork is very much intent on the use of technology to achieve a very appealing cacophony of sound that fits well with her lyrics and other instruments. These sounds create a veritable world of intense sound that is meant to allow the listener to appreciate the environment. Often this environment is intended to help musically express a natural surrounding. In a quote on her website, Bjork states:   Just as we use music to express parts of us that would otherwise be hidden, so to can we use technology to make visible much of nature's invisible world.... You will see how the three come together: nature, music, and technology. (Bjork.com)  Bjork's emphasis on the use of technology for expression within a musical piece is important to her and is made evident by her use of it in her second album Post.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I wish every e-book is this well compiled. Tables of contents for the whole collection and every book, every book accompanied by an introduction and nice, classic looking illustrations. Pages are well laid-out. You don't always get this for books you buy at Amazon - e.g. James Michener's Caravan, costs 8 bucks, yet no table of contents, no pictures, no nothing. Once you start, you just continue linearly to the end, as you do with the old tape recorder (minus Fast Forward). I guess from now on I will pay attention to Delphi Classics.
B005SV9W4Q|1.0|Lady Gaga is the rare mainstream artist who certainly needs not to suffer at the hand of the omniscient hack remixers and knob-tweakers who are so willing and encouraged to tamper with the hack that surrounds us these days. Her work could not be any more fully realized, especially through any vision than her own. This Lady's artistry more often than not leaves the tip of her brush as a finished product: polished, appealing, intriguing, provocative. Another reason she's such a refreshing presence in the Top 40 market is how accessible she makes herself to her approving public. In this case, she's a little accessible. Other than that, I can't understand the reasoning behind this remix project--AT ALL. Two contributions stand out, as the integrity of the original song is given priority over the ego of the remixers while the mixers' remain able to exude their own interpretive expression: Yoü And I (Metronomy Remix) &  Born This Way (Twin Shadow Remix). In the instances where ego overpowers the song's intergity the results are little more than amaturish, masterbatory studio skills. In a holiday season that's been rather slow with product aimed squarely at the holiday shopper, this release's non-necessity and commercial aspirations are truly apparent.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This is absolutely a must have app if you like to tinker with your electronics.  I use it with a galaxy tab 10.1 it works perfectly. Fast upload and download and the author updates it at least once a week with new features. I am constantly changing my rom and sideloading apps and it's so much faster and cleaner than connecting the proprietary usb cable. I'd say for the 99 cents it's a no brainer.   The one feature i'd like to see added would be a start/stop button at the top of the app.  Otherwise perfect.  5 stars.
B004WYYI7Q|5.0|This book could seriously change your life.<br /><br />These guys did a lot of research that I think would surprise -- yet, ultimately encourage -- most folks.<br /><br />Three key findings:<br />1) Most people who are millionaires don't live the flashy lifestyle<br />2) Most people who live the flashy lifestyle aren't millionaires<br />3) YOU can adopt a few simple lifestyle changes and mentalities that will make it MUCH EASIER for you to achieve financial security by simply realizing where your money goes each month!  By starting to play better financial 'defense' you can become much more financially secure.<br /><br />The authors present interesting and compelling facts in a persuasive and interesting manner. This is a quick read.  It could turn most of your assumptions about wealth accumulation and financial security on their heads!<br /><br />I borrowed and read this book years ago, but wanted to read it again.  I bought it used and finished it in two days; it is all still relevant. I highlighted only the parts I thought were gems, and used up a whole highlighter.  These principles WORK (suffice to say, they did in my case)!<br />The self-made wealthy already abide by most of these concepts; they drive used cars, shop for bargains, and usually don't buy fancy homes!<br />The high-earners with little to show for their years of high income will find practical advice to stop the bleeding and start building wealth; they will recognize their dumb habits immediately!<br />Those with a low income will benefit by the encouragement and practical tips to begin growing wealth -- it can be done, and there are plenty of examples of it!<br /><br />If you want a book packed with a lot of just plain 'uncommon' common sense, get this one.  It will make it easier for you to do the right things for your financial future.  You will have less desire to live a \\"BIG HAT, NO CATTLE\\" lifestyle once you realize you could have financial independence instead -- an even bigger luxury.<br /><br />This is a book I think that should be recommended reading for every high school student; if people realized all the wisdom packed into these pages, we would see far more sensible life choices being made by American households.  We wouldn't have so many families buying stuff they don't need -- with money they don't have -- to impress people they don't like!<br /><br />In summary:  You're buying a lot of valuable wisdom in a very inexpensive book.  Make this book your first investment.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is the ultimate for every gamer who needs to take their console with them. Screen is great and the speakers are not that bad as well. I purchased this during the Black Friday deals and it was only $199. I would still recommend this product even at full price if you need to travel with your console and protect it from damage. Case is extremely sturdy and just feels great when everything is packed together. My only recommendation would be to add somewhere to store games during transit.
1451648537|5.0|Learn about the grueling mind of Steve Jobs, read about his habits, his thought process. Truly an amazing and inspiring book. One thing for sure, you will be  surprised. He is like none other and after reading this book it's no wonder why Apple became what it is today.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|This is a really fantastic movie. It is thrilling and adventurous and even funny at times. I really loved how well the story moved... how you had absolutely no idea what was going on and then it all made sense. Of course there are times when you wonder \\"Why the heck did she do that? She could have just [insert logical scenario].\\" But of course, it's a movie, so it's easy to forgive the characters for not following your advice. Overall, it is a really great movie. Hanna is a bad a** chick!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the extensive amount of customizations available with this alarm clock.

Its not so much bubbly and cheery, but more laid back and classic.  If thats the feel you desire in your Christmas tunes, pick this one up!

0316069884|4.0|I have \\"flirted\\" with vegetarianism since high school, going through various stages such as \\"I won't eat anything attached to a bone\\" or \\"no smart animals,\\" etc. I had always objected to veal due to the way it was raised: animals trapped in tight pens, fattened up and slaughtered young. It was disconcerting to read in this book, in conjunction with the movie [[ASIN:B002LBKDYE Food, Inc. [Blu-ray]]]., that almost all of the animals we eat are processed this way, as if they were not mammals. In fact, they have been genetically engineered and pumped full of drugs and hormones to gain weight so quickly that they can't even move if they chose to--and we wonder why America, who is eating this drugged up meat, has an obesity epidemic. This book is not for the weak-stomached, but it is worth reading just as Upton Sinclair's [[ASIN:1617200514 The Jungle: Complete and Unabridged by Upton Sinclair]] spotlighted the horrible conditions in meat packing plants 100 years ago. Sadly, the carnage has only gotten more efficient. Although Safran Foer sets out specifically stating that he is not trying to make anyone into a vegetarian, it would be hard to read this book and believe otherwise, especially when he says that it is not enough to choose not to eat meat for himself and his family, but to change the industry he must convince others to change their behavior. Has this book made me finally commit to vegetarianism? Despite its best efforts, no, it has not... completely. However, I have continued to eliminate meat from my diet including meat and pork, and now I make an attempt to eat vegetarian for every meal, but it is a work in progress.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I ordered the Microshell Folio Cover in white  for my new Kindle Fire and I am really happy that I did.  The quality of workmanship is very good.  The Kindle Fire fits snugly inside.  The shell is very hard and provides excellent protection.  The cover folds to form a stand that is stable.  I have read a couple of reviews that stated that the stand feature was flimsy and did not work properly.  I have not experienced this problem.  I highly recommend this cover.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|What exactly is the plot anyway?  Some \\"thing\\".  Some \\"monster\\".  Is it an alien?  Dracula?  Bigfoot?  A kitten?  The reviews here are mostly horrible too, which makes the title seem too forced.  Most of these reviews read like they were written by promoters for the movie itself.  Thanks, I'm sure you want me to think your product is great.  That's implicit in its mere existence.  But that does nothing to convince anyone.  It only adds to the lack of clarity and pointlessness by making it seem forced.  \\"Umm, guys?  This title is a bomb, so let's talk it up so we at least make back our investment.\\"  \\"Haha, yeah!  Why actually make something decent when we can just force it down peoples' throats by artificially interfering with their purchase decisions?\\"  Now to make thoughts like this seem stupid, half the reviews will be removed or rewritten, and a reply left to say, \\"I don't see what you're talking about, derp.\\"  Maybe not, but I look at it this way: I could either look stupid by having that happen or look stupid by saying this and having it not happen.  But that doesn't mean I shouldn't speak up.  If you're going to hire shills to post fake reviews, then at least have them look into real ones.  NOBODY has only good things to say about ANYTHING.  It's human nature.  They need to identify the customers' reason to not buy, address that to make it appear to be of no concern, and then complain about some random, inconsequential thing.  Then follow up with a review that makes it sound great but complains about things people never complain about.  \\"The story ROCKED but that one dude's shirt had a coffee stain on it.\\"  Shill FAIL
0143038419|3.0|I originally picked up this book because of the interesting story plot, and while I still think the story was pretty interesting, the writing style just didn't cut it. I didn't feel as if anything was flowing right, and the book simply didn't grasp my attention. I finished it because I hate starting books and not finishing them, but I have to admit I continued reading the book with such dread it was like a homework assignment. I did appreciated the acknowledgement of different cultures. The main character whined the entire book and somehow I just couldn't bring myself to actually feel sorry for her because she was so annoying. I wouldn't really reccomend this book to anyone looking for a captivating read.

I got tired of switching between game and on line to learn what's next, but the guide is small print and hard for me to see. The price was good ($16.18 + 4.00 shipping), 12 days to receive seems a bit long. Packing was good. Most reviews are better than mine which is why I bought the guide, so don't be surprized if you're disappointed.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|A great album through and through.  If you want a good preview of it, I recommend checking out the video of \\"Ashes and Fire\\" on You Tube.  He is alone in a radio studio in some other country, just him and his guitar and harmonica, and the performance is a stunner.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|I remember the time I went to Justice's performance about 3 years ago, and that was the first time ever I listened to songs by Justice. They performed at a mid-size, electro club in Seoul, Korea, and I believe that there were more than 300 people at the club that night to listen to Justice performing and to have some fun! They basically played songs from their first album \\"Cross.\\" I had to buy their album the very next day of the performance because both their performance and songs were so good that I couldn't get them out of my mind.     All songs in this album in general have great melody lines, which are so good that almost every song can be a big hit, and I am not exacerbating. Also, it is really amazing how they composed in ways to blend all those noisy sounds, hooks, and melodies. It's just they did it so well, and especially if one considers the fact that this album was their debut album, everyone should feel the same or at least give them some acknowledgement. Justice used lots of dirty, noisy sounds in the album other than addictive melody lines. Talking about techniques used in the album, I can tell that Justice uses multiple layers and clouds in their compositions, and such layering multiple chunks of sounds to make up rhythms and essentially the music gives very complex, yet rich sounds. In addition, it's a bit obvious, but still it's worth pointing out they used synthesizers. Unfortunately, my knowledge in computer music is not at the level where I can tell which types of synthesizers were used by hearing songs. Yet, I am very inspired by this album in that it kind of showed me how synthesizers can be used in different ways and what kind of sounds one can generate with synthesizers. For example, a track called \\"Stress\\" almost seems to be made of sounds generated only by synthesizer. Moreover, I did a short research and confirmed that Justice used a technique called microsampling. Microsampling is a technique of sampling and rearranging very small piecesof other songs into a new form where they cannot be recognized. Such technique was used in \\"Genesis.\\" While most of the tracks in the album only include computer generated tunes, tracks such as \\"D.A.N.C.E.,\\" \\"The Party,\\" and \\"DVNO\\" include lyrics. One last technique I was able to catch is a technique that is very commonly used when DJs make mix-tapes. Justice ended each track with the beginning beat of the next track, so tracks can sound somehow connected.      It may be just me, but I think it's very interesting how the songs in the album are titled and ordered and how they make sense as if they make up a story line. Many reviews and comments I read online about Justice and their albums talked about how Justice focuses only on \\"having fun.\\" However, I have to disagree. When I listened to all tracks in order without cutting off in the middle, I felt something, which I'd never felt before listening to individual tracks separately. I wasn't really able to put it in words quite directly but felt like this album was not a collection of unrelated, individual tracks but rather one song. Although it is true that Justice intended to connect songs with the beat connecting technique mentioned before, I once thought there might be something Justice wanted to say. Only if I had known Justice and had listened to their songs before I met them in a restroom at a club back in 3 years ago, I would definitely have asked them to find out what message they tried to give.       Being one of the mainstream electronic music artists, Justice may not be considered as much experimenting with computer music as scholarly electronic musicians because they are probably more interested in making accessible and club friendly songs, which people can enjoy and have fun with them. However, what Justice can do with music and their great songs definitely have something to contribute to the development of computer music.

1609611543|4.0|Wheat Belly lends an easy read yet it could have been edited to half the pages. Starts with an informative history of genetic changes wheat has experienced through the ages then trends to patient Bios and anecdotal tales that seem more filler than educational. The recipe section is an inspiring collection that prompts a page holder and a quick step to the kitchen. Too bad it wasn't a bigger section of the book. Could a few more good reviews of Dr. Davis meal plans point to a future wheat alternative cook book ??  I would recommend this book to family and friends in hope they lose the wheat and trim those carbs.....
B005F6NA56|5.0|If you're looking for another \\"1,2,3,4\\", you won't find it on 'Metals'.  What you do get is another mighty-fine effort by Feist, Gonzales & cohorts.  This album is a seemingly quiet affair.  The instrumentation is sparse and the lyrics are plaintive, just what you'd expect from Feist if you've really been listening.  \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" as the opening track seems dour, but in a good way, as you realize the truth in the song.  Love the way they recorded the vocals again.  Very-much how they were captured on 'The Reminder'.  The production on this album is soft and doesn't transfer very well on MP3 players.  Do yourself a favor and get the CD as there is a wide dynamic range on this recording.  Feist's vocal delivery is jaw-dropping.  \\"A Commotion\\" sounds like something Kate Bush would have recorded but that's no rip on Leslie, it works, and quite well.  If you've loved her acoustic performances of her past work, you will be pleased to know you're going to get your fix.  I can't emphasize enough the raw emotion captured on this album and frankly don't understand why anyone who is giving this record a bad rating would do so.  That's insulting!  This is quite the personal statement and whether-or-not 'Metals' is meant to be that or not, this is classic.  Guaranteed to be listened to many years from now.

1451648537|5.0|Like many, I am newer to the world of Apple because of the iPods and iPads and truly love the product.  When I heard that there was a biography coming on Steve Jobs, I wanted to read it.  His pursuit for perfection was obsessive, but yet the results and the revolution he really led speaks for themselves.  Though there are aspects of his personality that were less than likable, the book overall is a good one to learn about the man with many memorable anecdotes ranging from how he viewed his birth parents to regrets and things he wish he could have done over. He is candid and admits his mistakes.  Walter Issacson makes this an easy read to go through and very worthwhile.  It is rare to know that we are seeing such a person who changed so many things during his life and now with his passing we know some more.

0060594896|5.0|I really love this book, not only because the content is very helpful when it comes to needing some good tips on being succesful but also because I'm using it with my students (I'm an ESL teacher in Mexico) for their reading comprehension class and it has turned out to be a wonderful tool because of how well written it is. The vocabulary used in it is easy to understand by my intermediate level students, obviously providing them with new words and expressions  and a good chance to see how the structures that they have been studying are used outside of a traditional \\"text book\\", which I'm no longer using by the way. Now, the principles have also helped us a lot (my students as well as myself).  As soon as the students understand the meaning of the \\"new vocabulary\\" and idiomatic expressions, we discuss them, express out our own opinions about them and then start putting them into practice. To make a long story short, WE love it!!!<br />PS. A couple of my students have already gotten a promotion and they tell me that they are sure they got it because they can now communicate in English and they are practicing the Success Principles day after day.
038572179X|5.0|This is tremendous achievement.  I hadn't read anything about this before reading it so I was, of course, shocked by the ending.  Despite the shock, I really recall the beauty of the prose much more vividly.  Some of the passages are stunning.  McEwan has a knack for capturing scenes and building tension so slowly that a reader is lulled into comfort only to be roused out of complacency.
1451648537|1.0|I love to read biographies. For me it's better, then any fiction, it's about real people, real life in real time. And it is first time when the author actually does not like the person he writes about. Not only that, he wants us to think bad about SJ too. I find it very dishonest
B001Q9E9F6|3.0|I enjoyed reading this, but it seems ancient now.  I guess individuals DO have greater access to their obscure tastes at the present moment.  However, I'm not sure individuals are taking advantage of this access.  To my mind, culture through the use of social media is evolving in such a way as to give greater choice with people making many of the same choices.  I appreciated the theories in this book and I'll continue to ponder them as the world changes.

B0032KNA4I|1.0|This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. The director and writers tried to create excitement with computer generated special effects over and over again. When will the movie producers learn that it takes more than just special effects to make a good movie. If you are expecting a movie similar to Indenpendance Day, you will be saddly disappointed. If you must see this movie, then rent it in DVD format - Blu-ray only makes it worse. If I coud give this movie \\"no stars\\" then I would.
1466284862|5.0|This is my favorite Forster book.  I enjoyed it even more than \\"Passage to India.\\"  He not only answers earlier English novels here, he creates a world and characters in a family that stick with a reader long after the final page.  My suggestion after finishing this is to read Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\" to see how she answers Forster.
031617615X|5.0|I didn't start at the first Twilight book and become hooked from the start. I couldn't stand all the hype about it and was aggravated with the whole situation in the start but decided to sit down and read Breaking Dawn. I was so angry that I hadn't when it first came out, I couldn't believe what I was missing out on! I wouldn't say I jumped on the band wagon but I absolutley read this book first, started with Twilight then New Moon then Eclipse and the I saw the movies.   Without going to much into the other books/movies, I fell in love with this book, as a matter of fact, I have read it twice! I don't want to give spoilers but it was just what I expected from the ending of the series, I think it is what we all wanted!   To those on the edge of decision, READ IT, you won't be dissapointed, you will be so happy that you did!
B004KABHEY|5.0|I finished reading most of Dennis Lehane's work last year. Although the later Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro books are outstanding (namely Sacred, Gone Baby Gone, and Prayers for Rain), Shutter Island is my favorite (and, ironically enough, was also the one I had a hard time convincing myself to read before starting it). I have not seen the newly released film and probably will not see it any time soon. I have heard that the plot in the film is pretty transparent early on. Thankfully, this is not the case in the book. A reader is put into a mental institution in the 1950s and must determine what is going on and why. The plot unfolds like a hardboiled detective story, but one gets the sense that all is not right as the various characters interact against the backdrop of a great storm. Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels struggles with questions of identity and reality. However, to compound Daniels' problem is the fact that he has a dark, tragic past. Lehane mixes the complexities of past and present brilliantly and, in doing so, creates a world that stays with the reader long after the book is finished.
0062011847|1.0|It was a decent novel to start out with but it really lost steam around the second half.<br /><br />Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch and a half dozen other miscellaneous titles, finds himself on a forced vacation, and despite assurances to his wife that he would leave his work at home, finds himself dragged into yet another adventure.<br /><br />Any time previous this would be the makings of a great Discworld novel, but I found it to be severely lacking in comparison. Many of the characters are of subtly but noticeably differing character than before.<br /><br />Sir Vimes, who is on record as thoroughly despising his royal credentials, is very quick to start throwing around the fact that he knows all kinds of important people. Then there is the matter of the liberal use of a certain magical entity that Vimes employed throughout the novel, incongruously and inexpertly transplanted from a previous novel where it served as an antagonist.<br /><br />Vimes' faithful manservant Willikins provides the most distinct departure from his previous characterization. Where previously he was the very picture of a gentleman's gentleman who happened to have a past that lends itself well to expertise in various sharp instruments, here by mannerisms and speech, his shady past as street scum is on full display and for all the worlds appears to have just been randomly assigned the position of butler.<br /><br />Finally, the crime du jour was probably the biggest problem. Where previously Pratchett was more subtle about his approach to the crime, here he beats the reader over the head with it at every turn, stopping just short of having the characters just shout SLAVERY IS WRONG over and over again.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard Discworld fan who thinks Pratchett can do no wrong pick this up, otherwise avoid it like the plague and find shelter in the far superior previous works.

0545265355|1.0|I have so many reasons for disliking this book its hard to know what bothers me the most.  I guess I could start with the ludicrous premise of a world where a government is so incredibly evil it forces children to fight to the death in some fantastical high tech arena..... Lots of shades of grey there eh?  Or I could mention the juvenile plot focusing on action, surprise cliffhanger endings, and a simplistic \\"page turning\\" writing style at the expense of character depth and real plot development.  Or it could be the interminable costume and hair details that fill chapter after chapter that only a pre-pubescent female could possibly relate to.  Or maybe its the completely unsympathetic main character that forever dithers between two underdeveloped milk-toast males.  Lets not forget the impossible and inconsistent use of sci-fi technology where a society has nuclear weapons, the ability to make a wide variety of genetically altered beasts and flies around in hover crafts, but still devotes an entire segment of the population to \\"coal mining\\" and hunts with bows and arrows.  For anyone with an ounce of hunting or military knowledge, many of the scenes are actually laughably bad and poorly written. But I suppose that the most galling thing about this book is the final installment where the author basically runs out of ideas so she throws the kitchen sink at you in a series of ludicrous adventures where the main characters race toward an inevitable conclusion.  And then she unceremoniously kills off a main character to try to give her writing efforts some gravitas, if not an actual point.    Now I don't expect LOTR or Game of Thrones detail in a book written for teenagers.  But even compared to other books like Harry Potter, Eragon, or Redwall this is trite.  And giving it a bleak ending doesn't excuse the multitude of sins one must wade through to get to that nihilistic outcome.  On the plus side, it was an awfully fast read, so at least the torture won't last long.
1400064627|5.0|I have read this book three times now.  Everytime I have suggested to others they read it, I would never get the book back.  The book is an easy read.  It evokes the nostalgia of when people were 'good' to each other.  There is humor and a certain quality of what life can be.  Every character is its own individual without judgement.  I would recommend the book to anyone who would like to know how to enjoy life.  Read it.  It shows the flavor of southern-living.  FIVE STARS!

B002I0J5FG|2.0|I played both of these games back when they first came out on the PS2 and remember kinda enjoying them. Given all the effulgent gushing and kiss-blowing from so many other reviewers on various websites, I felt like I probably enjoyed both games more than I had remembered, and ended up buying this \\"remastered\\" collection. Turns out, I guess I had it backward, as both ICO and SOC ended up being very frustrating game experiences for me, each in their own ways.   ICO   There exists a small group of dedicated and vocal gamers who seem to really like the concept of videogames as art. While I don't have a problem with the fundamental idea (I loved Okami), I do have a major problem with development studios who hide poor game and programming design behind artsy camera angles and atmosphere, and try to pass it off as a videogame masterpiece. After having played through ICO (and also SOC) my opinion of Team ICO is that they are obviously very interested in creating art, but lack the technical knowlege required to craft a playable video game around it, and ultimately would be better off shooting an independent film or painting a series of pictures and then staring at them pensively.    Did I like anything about ICO? Yeah, I like the environmental puzzles, where the goal is always to figure out how to open a door or reach a certain ledge, and most of the solutions are logical (as environmental puzzles should be). That's about it though, as just about everything else in the game frustrated me almost to the point of quitting early (I didn't though, as I wanted to unlock all the trophies).   The things that crippled the game experience for me were the controls, the camera, the friendly AI, and the horribly boring and repetitive fights. The controls lack responsiveness and feel sluggish. Grabbing a hold of ladders or dangling chains is often far more difficult than it needs to be, and if a torch and switch are next to each other, it's not unusual to see your character grab the one you don't intend for him to grab. Repeatedly. The controls are also constantly locked in mortal combat with the semi-fixed camera angles. What this means is since your character moves in direct relation to the direction you're pushing, if you're holding right and running down the hallway and the camera decides to swing more to the right to face you, you'll end up running into the wall since the wall is now directly to your right and that's still the direction you're pushing. It's lazy programming, and most other third person game developers have figured out how to deal with this irritation. The camera also has the annoying habit of swivelling around to face your character as he's moving, so that you can't see what's coming up without using the right analog stick to move the entire camera frame to the right (the only real camera control the game allows the player), leaving your character out of the picture, and providing a terribly disorienting angle on the gameplay. It's just bad design, and no other game that I can think of has this set-up.   The friendly AI is an abject failure of videogame programming. What more can be said? Yorda has serious issues with following commands, and it's all too common to see her struggle with climbing onto ladders or even continuing to climb up ladders without inexplicably reversing tack and climbing back down. She can't drop down a 4 foot ledge in one room, but she can drop down a different 4 food ledge in another room. And God forbid you get in a hurry, as Yorda has the nasty habit of strolling along when you need her to run quickly (like in battles). The whole thing is incredibly irritating and makes it feel like your main goal of the entire game is to babysit a slow child... which I guess it pretty much is.   Battles are boring and one dimensional and involve wailing on wave after wave of shadow creature with your trusty 2x4 or sword. Some battles can be avoided, fortunately, but avoidance frequently leads you into an even greaterbattle as the controls and camera once again tagteam your escape efforts. Honestly, the battles should've just been removed. They add nothing to the game and only detract from it.   Can't comment on the music since there really isn't any. If you get a hard-on listening to endless feet clacking on stone, or wind rustling, or the odd phrase \\"bon swah\\" repeated over and over and OVER AGAIN, then you're in luck.   I can't help but feel like this game would be better served as a downloadable title for like $10 max.  SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS   I spent more text than I thought I would describing ICO, so I'll keep the SOC part briefer. Overall, it's a better game than ICO, but it has its very own set of design flaws which seriously maimed a game experience that should otherwise be amazing. There is little doubt that Team ICO made this game, given their efforts with ICO.   You have full camera control this time around, but it's not what I thought it'd be. Most third person games provide the player with limited camera control in which the game keeps the camera behind your character and moves accordingly as you move your character, but still allows you to move the camera yourself if necessary. In SOC, there is no automatic camera control by the game. What this means is that if you're doing more than moving in a straight line, you're going to have to have one thumb on the right analog stick moving it AT ALL TIMES. Take a break for a second, and you'll find your character moving to the side of the screen or facing you, providing you with absolutely no warning of what's coming up. Pull out your bow while running toward the screen (toward you) and your character aims/shoots at you instead of the colossus in the background (which is indescribably backward compared to other games in which your character usually immediately faces the enemy). Controlling the horse while using the camera is also bizarrely overcomplicated and has you doing thumb aerobics switching back and forth betweenthe X button for \\"speed up horse\\" and the right thumb stick for camera control. The control/camera set-up is poorly thought out and should have been simplified.... especially for a game that prides itself on its relaxed atmosphere.    The controls (like ICO) are sluggish and don't feel very responsive. Button presses while climbing/battling a colossus are treated by the game as less of a distinct command and as more of a polite request.... a request that is often blatantly ignored. While some of the time it's the game simply not responding to input by the player, oftentimes it's because your character is too busy flopping around on the colossus like a edematous skin tag to pay attention to anything you're asking him to do. \\"Please jump from the colossus's arm to his back.\\" \\"Sorry can't do that, as he's breathing heavily right now, and for some reason I can't stop seizing like an epileptic when the colossus is doing anything other than standing completely still.\\" Where this becomes really stupid is when a colossus gets stuck in an endless loop of shaking, essentially rendering you immobile (yet floppy) until your grip runs out, and you fall to the ground, only to begin the climbing process yet again. Considering that the vast bulk of the SOC game experience revolves around this kind of stuff, I quickly found myself getting frustrated, bored, and not having fun. And videogame are supposed to be fun, right? If you don't believe this, you're playing them for the wrong reason.   I'll stop there, as this is getting too long already. What makes SOC game so annoying is not the individual design problems in isolation, it's how they conspire against you all at once, and throughout the entire game. Seriously, if the controls and camera were improved, intuitive, and responsive, then I would've rated this game much higher. Both games, in fact. But just a few design flaws can ruin a game if they're frustrating enough. Life's too busy to waste this kind of time on poor/lazy game design.   **The music is incredible, by the way, and is some of the best I've experienced in the medium. For this reason, I bumped the overall rating from one star to two. Really, I should've just bought the official SOC soundtrack and saved myself the wasted time. Hindsight's 20/20.  -------  So that's my differing opinion on the ICO/SCO collection. Not that it's going to persuade anyone to avoid these games, but I find it's always refreshing to hear a viewpoint different from that of the majority. Do what you want with it.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|If I had rated it immediately I would have given it 5 stars, if I had listened to it three times I would have given it 2 stars,<br />and now after a week of listening to it I settle on the 4stars.

(3) It's slow, it evokes winter - maybe because<br />I live in Alaska (we've had snow since end of October) - it's easy to get into the feel of it.  Winter is  a season that demands certain<br />things from you.  The cold, the darkness, and the slowing down in activity all are complemented by the music here.  It's a successful<br />album in this regard.  But I get why some find it boring.  I know I won't listen to this thing next April.  My only complaint is that it isn't<br />musically interesting.  I liked Sting's winter album because of the variety of instruments and variety in song selection.  I wonder how hard<br />it is to accept this album if you've been with her since the beginning?  I haven't.
B003Y5H5C4|1.0|I dont necessarily mind silly and vulgar, but toss in lack of creativity in the dialogue, badly acted and poorly directed, and you have a stilted kind of malaise even as the \\"action\\" takes place. Eisenberg shows off why he's an Oscar-worthy professional while his character's pal Chet (Aziz Ansari), often spews out dialogue loudly without the accompanying emotion, his eyes almost always bugging out of his face like a bulldog. In every scene, he saps whatever chemistry there might be by sounding like he's trying to land a part as a voice in an animated film. Where's the director here? In a strip joint scene, a girl (about a 6 on a scale of 0 to 10) strips off her top to reveal an unimpressive chest without any of the sensual moves one expects in a good lap dance,  - which is meant to dazzle the male character into deciding to kill his own father for the sensual delights of monetary inheritance - but you wonder how mediocre does everything have to be in this movie? You wonder if the director has ever been to a strip joint or is Gay? Maybe they should have brought in a heterosexual to explain to him that strippers giving lap dances are supposed to appear sexy, tantalizing and sensual.  Danny McBride was actually more dynamic emotionally  in Tropic Thunder where he had a bit part. His one-dimensional personification of his character was a letdown which made this movie a total turkey. How bad an actor does one have to be to play a wannabee murderer committing Patricide and still remain boring?<br /><br />This film reminded me of a similar situation when Lindsay Lohan played the lead in \\"I KNOw who Killed Me,\\" another sophomoric attempt at moviemaking on the part of the director, writer and producer, but Lohan was so real and so deep in her part that she held you in every scene with her presence. Eisenberg almost does the same, much as a professional would in a school-play surrounded by adolescents.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|This video provides iconic and diverse excerts from this classic US TV show that ran between 1969 and 1971.  The DVD has about 4 hours of footage and I found it very hard to switch-off for a break, given the fabulous and gripping performances throughout this DVD. There is also very interesting narrative from Kris Kristofferson and  a number of people who knew and played with John.   I would highly recommend this DVD as one of the best music DVD's I have seen.  [[ASIN:B000TLMWMY The Johnny Cash Show: The Best of Johnny Cash 1969-1971]].
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Run!  It's angry birds!  Well, for little feathery fluffs that get slung out of sling shots they don't seem so menacing or even angry but the game is fun.
B0013ND30W|4.0|Bought this used but it's a blu-ray so there was no problem when I played it on a blu-ray player nor a PC blu-day laptop.  The Blu-Ray cover was a little beat up since it's a used product but I am not complaining. It's a nice addition to our daughter's Disney collection.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I can tell you all about how the production was excellent, how the lyrical content was meaningful by Drake's means, and that it drew from a lot of roots of music- but you know that already. I can tell you this: I just sat and listened to the whole album. It's in my opinion worth every penny.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It has a ton of capabilities, but is still very simple to use - brilliant.  It will easily become part of your everyday life, thanks Evermore!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|this is a GREAT film.  Malick has given us a new way of creating narrative.  The flow of the film is rarely interrupted, beautifully filmed.  I had difficulty with the first viewing, but subsequent viewing made me see how seamless the storyline is.  My initial resistence was probably due to over indentification.  Pitt has never been better, and Chastain was a revelation.
B004LUS390|4.0|I LOVE this app, but I disagree with the product description that this would necessarily be the right choice for the 'casual doodler.'  I love to draw (though I am not a trained artist) and have used a couple of drawing apps on the PC in the past, so I had some basis for understanding the various icons.  But it still was a high learning curve for me to learn how to use this app.<br /><br />I wish that it had a menu system across the top (a hidden one that pops up when you click the top of the screen) where you could pick colors and other basic commands instead of having to figure out which icon meant what and constantly going back and forth from between screens to change colors.<br /><br />I saw something in the very basic \\"how to\\" that comes up when you first open the app about pressing in the middle of the circle where you pick your pen type, but I could never get that to work...I've only been using the app about a week but was a passengar on a car trip earlier this week and made a lot of use of the app then.  With more use, I'm sure I'll discover new options.<br /><br />For an artist, I can imagine that this would be like being a kid in a candy store. It is really a tremendous little package for a very tiny price.  I just wish they'd made it a bit easier for the more novice among us to jump in with both feet.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|An excellent album. Beth Hart sits along side Adele and the late great Amy Winehouse.  With Beth's Rock and Soul voice we have the Great JB on guitar.  What more could you ask for
B005W3G2D4|5.0|The first time I heard all the songs, only a few stood out.  But listening to all the songs a few times, the rest grow on you.  All of them are definitely melodic and when combined with Kelly's awesome voice, it is without a doubt a winning combination.

1592332803|5.0|I can't believe the price of this book, so inexpensive for the quality and quantity of the recipes and info you get. I LOVE the peanut butter cookies. My mother-in-law (who said I could never be vegan, I love food too much) said they were the best peanut butter cookies she'd ever tried (and I'm a pretty bad cook, think they were even a little over done!) It has inspired her to become vegan and she is trying the recipes in this book. It's so user friendly, my 10 year old step daughter can easily follow the well written directions and of course is inspired to make the recipes based on the beautiful photos included in the book. Would definetly recommend it to vegan's and non-vegan's alike. Aside from giving vegan versions of many classic recipes, it also gives helpful health tips - like using non-hydrogenated oils rather that partially or fully hydrogenated oils. Thanks for creating such and amazing book!

B001CXWWBE|5.0|Lightning took out the on board card in one of our HP's.  So I just ran it on the built in WiFi.  However, through-put steadily degraded over the course of 3-4 months to the point to where it was averaging less than 1Mbps down, under two feet away from either WiFi transmitter.  I've changed PCI ethernet cards so many times in all the machines I've ever owned living here on a ridge, I can't remember all the instances.  So I'm accustomed to grabbing a 10 to 15 dollar \\"normal\\" PCI ethercard.  The over 30 dollar price of this PCI EXPRESS card was much more than I anticipated having to spend.  But, my daughter attends Georgia Cyber Academy for hours on end and this is her primary machine.  When she informed me she had to use the machine in the basement today, where it is much colder and away from the wood stove, I found this Intel card immediately from a place down the street, bit the bullet, and now it's done.  Pros:  It seems to work wonderfully, all my connectivity issues have been solved.  Literally a snap to install, as in it's much easier to push the card and properly seat it into the bus, compared to every one of the myriad of to this point, conventional PCI network cards I've installed in the past.  Naturally, the tongue part that goes into the groove of the bus strip has A LOT LESS length.  No compatibility or conflict issues with Win7 64bit.  It works like it belongs.  Definitely an upgrade.  Sort of like swapping out the stock muffler with a Flowmaster 44.  Cons:  As mentioned by others, if I'm paying 40 bux (microcenter but I required it NOW), or even 30 dollars, I'm thinking c'mon people, would it have harmed production costs to have a couple LEDs for All Systems Go indicators?  The CD that came with it useless, I wonder why they include them, yet another coaster.  As for installation, in my specific case, Windows did fail to properly install this device.  So I Googled Gigabit CT Desktop adapter, reached the Intel site, clicked around, found the driver package that seemed to make sense, downloaded it, and that software worked flawlessly with no issues whatsoever.  Plug in the CAT-5 and the highway was full on open at autobahn speeds a minute later.  Seeing that 3rd LAN port moving data fast on my FVG-318 via the two LED's on my favorite router blinking at me like Betty Boo's eye-lashes gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  It's good to have the home network firing on all cylinders again.  Order has been restored. Life's good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had a feeling that what happened at the end of the series was going to happen the whole way through. I do agree with other commenters though, it did feel kind of rushed, and I did lose her a couple times towards the end, but she reeled me back in and kept my attention for more than enough time to wow me yet again. I enjoyed this series so much, I actually put it down in 3 days, at a book a day. Highly recommended.
B000003S5H|5.0|Moon Safari, the second album by the French band Air, is notable perhaps not for introducing groundbreaking technosonic techniques as much as imagining a world in which the palette of sonic textures were so rich with technosonic elements. The first track off the album is a long instrumental that conjures immediately the world in which the rest of the album will transpire: a retro-futurist 1960's, with an optimistic perspective on technology and yes, the acquisition of that final frontier, space. The opening strains of the surprisingly long (over 7 minutes) La Femme D'Argent imagine Brazilian lounge, setting solidly into the realm of breezy cool. It is only on the periphery we are reminded of the electronic tones, be it either the exaggerated crispness of violin overtones or the bubbling synth that lifts the groove seamlessly back to speed. As the track progresses though, the template of bass/drum groove becomes rarified, and what only appeared to be accents before swarm thickly together, constituting all of the song by the end.  Immediately following the opening tour of the album, Moon Safari drops into probably the most stand-alone track offered, Sexy Boy. The arresting quality of the bass hook comes not from the melody as much as the thick vibrato with which it is announced. While the vibrato fades from the bass, it never fully leaves the song, transitioning from instrument to instrument and giving the whole piece a hazy quality - wonderfully offset by icy keyboard chimes that pierce the envelope occasionally.   The contrast between the first two tracks is probably the album's most arresting swing; the rest of the time, Air is enjoying the futuro-lounge territory they have scoped out for themselves. Certain tracks borrow less from synths and retro organs less than others - in particular, You Make It Easy and Ce Matin La could have been products of tropicalia were it not for the occasional sparkle of synth accenting each. On other tracks however, Air is much more inclined to invoke modular synths and electronic organs, giving the texture a decidedly forward-looking sound. These songs - Kelly Watch The Stars, Talisman - gain much from their steady underlying beats, which work so well together with the organ and synth sound, affecting dispassion as best they can. The insistence of the rhythm tracks in both of these songs permits the melodic elements to lift almost impossibly high, affecting the crystalline tone we have come to know so well.

B004EPZ07U|4.0|This review is not about the movie itself, but the included Digital Copy using UltraViolet (UV).  If you're read other reviews, you'll have seen that UV is NOT compatible with iTunes, but instead requires its own playback client (Flixster).  This review is about my experience with the process and service.  The movie comes with a card that contains the UV code and the web site information where to register.  The sign-up process took 5 minutes and was pretty simple.  To my surprise, I didn't just get access to the \\"Green Lantern\\" movie, but also to \\"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\\".  I don't know if that was part of a promotion or if every copy comes with it, but either way, I was positively surprised by this.  I've used Flixster on the Kindle Fire and iPhone 4S.  It works great on both devices.  I have NOT tried using AirPlay on the iPhone to see if I could send the movie to the Apple TV.  My only annoyance at the moment is that the Flixster app shows ads at times when you start it up.  There are no ads during the movie, so it's not disruptive.  However, I would have preferred if they had a dedicated UV playback app instead of putting it into Flixster, which is also used for other services where ads can be justified.  In short, if you're holding back on buying this package, because of UV, don't worry about it.  I was lucky to pick up this movie during Black Friday sales for $9.99 and thought that even if UV doesn't work, I'll still have the DVD and Bluray as fallback.  I'm glad I did and I would not hesitate to buy other UV movies in the future.  That said, if given a choice, I would opt for the old Digital Copy via iTunes since I'm more familiar with it.  Hope this helps!
B005ZO5N1W|4.0|This book is deeply formulaic, but it is good Nora formula. At this point, if you don't want to see what she has done so many times before and done well, why read her? More recently I've been irritated by bad Nora formula, but this has everything she does well. Appealing characters with chemistry, a heroine with a truly hard past you can root for, a great community, good suspense, and a discussion of an interesting world (search and rescue using dogs). Best yet--cute dogs! And we don't have to see the world from the animal's point of view (which has been happening with alarming regularity in some fiction). While I've not been happy with her trilogies lately (or the recent wedding quartet), the last couple of suspense books have been good old fashioned NR. Predictable? Yes? But enjoyable if that's what you're looking for? Absolutely! -

B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This is by far my favorite new show of 2011 (after Game of Thrones). In fact, it is one of my favorite shows period. The first episode confused me and will probably strike most people as flat out weird, but after the initial shock, you realize with each passing episode just how unique and compelling this show is.<br /><br />American Horror story follows a family of three as they move into a new home called \\"Murder House\\" by the locals.

B00319DND8|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  I usually like Matt Damon movies and I know one of the agents this movie is about.  I was really looking forward to seeing this.  The problem is the movie just can't decide whether it is a serious piece covering the very interesting true story of an informant with huge problems of his own or whether it is a comedy or a spoof.  It does a poor job of being funny and a poor job of being serious.  Another reviewer called the movie \\"quirky.\\"  That is a good description, but not in the sense that some movies are good because they are quirky.  This is quirky in the sense that the director just doesn't seem to have a clear vision of what this movie is intended to be.

0385534639|4.0|I really did enjoy this book, however it didn't quite live up to my expectations.  I think because of all the glowing reviews I read on here before buying it I was expecting to have my socks knocked off like when I read Harry Potter.  This book is nothing like Harry Potter.    Celia and Marco are chosen to participate in a competition using the Night Circus as the venue.  The rules of the competition are vague, and of course Celia and Marco fall into star crossed love complicating matters.  I think my main issue with the book is there are so very many unaswered questions and so many instances where the author tells us some bit of information and we're supposed to just believe her with no questions asked.  I think this is supposed to be a love story, but why do Celia and Marco love each other?  I think it could have been much more in this regard.  Ultimately, I think this is a book worth reading.  The writing is beautiful especially since this is her first novel.  And the plot is original and intriguing.  Although I enjoyed it I'm done now, and unlike books like Harry Potter that I want to read over and over I doubt I'll ever reread this.
0307891402|4.0|I decided to wait until after the game was released to see whether I wanted this guide.  That turned out to be a mistake.  After Amazon quickly sold out of the available copies of their Collector's Edition, it became a mad scramble to search for and eventually locate a copy at a retail bookseller.  The guide was completely shrink-wrapped, aside from a couple of tears in the extremely thin plastic covering.  Still, I ran into the issue other reviewers experienced with the pages warping and wrinkling.  The warping reminds me of what happens if you try to print a large image or photograph on thin paper.  As the ink settles into the page, the page itself tends to warp and ripple at the edges.  Whatever the cause, don't blame Amazon for the problem since it's happening regardless of where the book is purchased.<br /><br />The bonus online map you receive with the collector's edition is okay at best. At first I had issues with the map being very small on my 1920x1200 screen and not adjusting to scale when using Firefox but this appears to have been fixed.  Now I can at least see the map but I can't search for anything without getting an authorization error.  It's also slow to load and refresh (Skyrim's own map is better) and there are alternatives available for print and for iOS.  So don't think you're missing out if you get the regular edition without the map code.<br /><br />The guide itself is fantastically detailed, especially considering the size and scope of this game.  It's rather like a school textbook (without the ripoff price) and you don't see space filler or blank pages anywhere.  In the table of contents, the quests are broken down by series.  For instance, if you decide to join the mage college the quests will be listed in order of completion.  I understand the rationale, but found it difficult at times to look up quests this way.  Plus the index doesn't list quests by title, as it should.  For example, the quest \\"Hunter and Hunted\\" is listed as \\"Dungeon Quest: Hunter and Hunted\\", indexed in letter D instead of letter H.  I don't understand why they did this.<br /><br />I found a few minor mistakes, for instance I'm pretty sure I have been able to soul-trap draugrs.  Nothing game-breaking, though.  It would have been nice to see some explanation of the console commands or .ini file configurations available to customize the game.  As these items are slowly discovered, online Wiki's will start to surpass the information available here.  For the money, especially the Amazon discount price, you're getting a treasure trove of information.  It has already paid for itself by guiding me through some frustrating areas where I was stuck.

B0017DJ3UW|5.0|I celebrate Christmas very minimally AND I don't fully care for Mariah's work normally, but I still had to write and give this album respect!<br /><br />I will be first in line to say that Mariah (especially at the point in her career when this album was recorded) has one of the best voices one could ever hope to hear or be gifted with, BUT over the course of her discography, I find that I generally don't like her choice of material, and much of it is overproduced and oversung. (I think that's what people are referring to when they say they don't like her; I fail to see how one could claim her voice is not excellent.)<br /><br />This album, though, is well-tailored to her voice, and a lot of it is gospel-ish, which I found I liked. It suits the material and her voice, and I'd like to hear a full gospel album by her.<br /><br />In particular, her 'O Holy Night' is, strangely, my favorite version of the song. The vocal range and power displayed is ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING (any singer who listens will understand and be awed), and there is an unquantifiable element of audible joy in the song.  Is it joy at the subject matter, the thought of Jesus? Maybe. For myself, it sounds like the sheer joy of someone lost in the grip of their gift, like the joy you can see in an Olympic athlete excelling at his sport, or a horse taking joy in the wind in its mane knowing it sure can RUN.<br /><br />Perhaps it's both, but either way, it's a great album, and unless you just hate every single thing about Mariah Carey, you'll find there's at least several songs on this album for you.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|I use Go Launcher EX and it has folders built into it, which is a nice way to organize your apps. I myself like to have access to my apps from the desktop screen and not have to wade through all of the app icons in the app drawer. However, using folders in Go Launcher EX becomes problematic in that scrolling through them is very slow, even on my Droid X2.<br /><br />Enter FolderOrganizer. This is like the free AppOrganizer application, but allows you to not only organize your apps into \\"folders\\" on the desktop, but also other items, such as contacts, bookmarks, etc. Plus, it has some nice widgets and allows editing of the icon and other information for each of your \\"folders\\".<br /><br />Actually, \\"folders\\" is wrong. You label your applications and then you can create a shortcut to that label on your home screen. Or, you can create widgets to the labels which can be customized to display in different ways.<br /><br />I started out with AppOrganizer and luckily, you can export your labels from that app and import them right into FolderOrganizer without a problem.<br /><br />This is definitely worth the price. I didn't think I'd care about the extras this provides over AppOrganizer, but it definitely was worth it.
1451627289|5.0|Wow!  A Stephen King novel that seemed so intimidating at 849 pages has now been devoured and digested and I can safely say that \\"11/22/63\\" was a remarkable achievement.  Like so many others, I have been a Constant Reader of everything King has published over the past 35 plus years, and I definitly found \\"11/22/63\\" to be an upgrade from a great deal of his recent material. In many ways, it was a return to form for King while taking on the very tricky and fictional mine field of time travel.  Many lament that Stephen King has never adhered to the \\"less is more\\" concept and sometimes they have been right.  Yet in the case of \\"11/22/63\\", the extended form of the novel is less due to bloat (there surely is some superfluous material crying for editing) than due to the subject matter and storyline.  When Jake Eppling becomes George Amberson and steps through the portal in Al's Diner to return to 1958 to attempt to save JFK from being assassinated in 1963, he is forced to \\"live\\" for 5 years in a time and place unknown and totally foreign to him.  Focusing most of the narrative on how he adjusts (or doesn't, in some cases) over those five years provides the reader with the real story here--Jake is a man out of time (like a fish out of water) devoted to a seemingly impossible task who falls in love with a very special woman who was living 53 years before his time, causing Jake to be ultimately confronted with challenges and choices that should make for provocative thinking for any reader.  This long section of the book does several things including, conveying the love story of star-crossed (time-crossed lovers), developing a sense of time and place, and providing a needed and satisfying development of the prominent characters in the book.  Certainly the story would have been much thinner were it not for the tragic love story of Jake (George) and Sadie.   Having lived through that era, as did King, I enjoyed his reflections on the music, movies, and culture of the time--certainly a simpler time (no internet, no cell phones, no computers), yet certainly a challenging time (racism, threat of WWIII).  And King's handling of the whole time travel paradox is well conceived compared to many of those time travel novels that fail under their own pretensions.  Can Jake change the course of history by going back in time?  He quickly discovers that the past is obdurate--the past fights to prevent change.  If he can change the past, should he?  Are there consequences to any change--oh yes, Constant Reader--the \\"butterfly effect\\" insures there will be consequences of some manner.  Much of the joy of this novel, beyond the love story, the depiction of the late 50's early 60's era, and the question of whether he can succeed in his mission, is the provocative questions King's narrative poses for his readers.  Would we readily accept the opportunity to step through a portal in time; indeed, if we did, would we be willing to live 5 years in a different time and place in an attempt to change the course of history (not knowing if we successfully could)?  Would we be open to truly living in that time to the extent of falling in love, or marrying, or having children or whatever?  And how would we handle the so called \\"butterfly effect\\" that posits that anything changed in the past, no matter how small, has consequences in the future?  I found \\"11/22/63\\" to be a thoughtful attempt at the time travel theme by Stephen King that provided the reader with a genuine love story wrapped in paradoxes and enigmas surrounding time, timeless love, and the enduring curiosity of man.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Whoooo. Great, great album from the Black Keys. I first caught on to this band when I heard \\"The Flame\\" some years back, and though I always felt like they have some fantastic songs, I never quite loved one of their albums in its entirety. Until Brothers, that is. My wife might be getting slightly irritated with me because I just have this album on repeat. I've also been listening to it during my commute to work for the past few weeks and it sure does add a beat to my step.
B000002WU9|5.0|This joint gives me chills whenever I play it.  The skills, passion and take-no-prisoners approach that was taken on this album make it a hard core hip-hop fan's dream come true.  Warning:  There are some ridiculous beats on this album.  If you are a producer the illness of the beats is probably going to hurt your feelings.  Wu-Gambinos?  Incarcerated Scarfaces?  Criminology?  What is with the RIDICULOUS beat on \\"Verbal Intercourse\\"?  The beat is CRAZY.  Raekwon and Ghost rank with the finest duos hip-hop has ever produced.  Their chemistry got even better following this album, as did Ghostface Killah's flow.  Ghostface was not yet the master MC that he would become on this project but his energy more than compensates for the process of ascension that his MCing was undergoing. The album would not have been perfect without him.  He's like an unpolished gem of an MC on \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\".  Some of my favorite verses have come from MC's who were still trying to find their true voice on the microphone.  They aren't perfect but they still go for what they know and you can hear the talent just waiting to bust loose (i.e. Common \\"Can I Borrow a Dollar\\", Phife \\"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\\").  I love hearing that in an up and coming MC.    This album is lyrically cerebral but deceives the untrained listener with the appearance of simplicity.  Raekwon's flow is simultaneously hard and smooth.  The RZA's productions are amazing.  The stories are told with the angst and aggression of the times.  The emotional range of this album is awesome.  \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" is perfect.  Just perfect.

B005UVW13I|5.0|This great book should have a different title (although it is technically accurate). The author makes one think clearly about the basic elements of life and God, while sprinkling it liberally with dry, very clever humor. He shares his odyssey from a young child's curiosity, a young person's cynicism, an agnostic, commonly-shared view of God and religion, to the realization that Christianity is the only \\"system\\" that truly makes sense in a complete fashion.   This would be a great little book to share with an intelligent agnostic that would challenge his preconceived notions about religion and God. Well done, Mr. Chesterton.
B000FC1KBG|1.0|Do not purchase this book for your kindle. I am extremely disappointed  Not only is it MORE expensive to purchase the electronic version (which is ridiculous) but they did NOT convert the charts for proper kindle viewing.  There are quite a few informative charts and helpful notes within the book.  Sadly the editors did not convert these charts & tips to work effectively within a digital reader. It is virtually impossible to read the charts.   As the chart information is not listed in the text you will fight with your digital reader to scroll through the chart for the valuable information - like on baby signals, how to read them and what they mean.  I don't know why they didnt just use a chart format that the other books I have on kindle use...but it is frustrating and ineffective.  I want my money back.

B004ZN9ERI|5.0|This is one of the forgotten albums in the Pink Floyd canon, yet it is one of their most whimsical, eccentricly weird enjoyable albums because of rock legend Syd Barrett. Barrett was certifiable insane or at least eccentric to the max and most of the tunes were written by him. It is real \\"Space Cadet\\" music. Most of the songs are short and odd. It is a lot of fun especially under the right circumstances. The reproduction is outstanding. I had the 1992 release, but this is light years ahead in sound. Brilliant old chap, Brilliant!

B004R13U6Y|5.0|WARNING UPDATE: 01/05/12<br />For some odd reason, this PDF reader crashes a lot after the recent Kindle Fire update. Specifically, the app crashes whenever you're reading a PDF document, turn off the Kindle Fire (not shut down) and return later. After a short while, the app will crash and bring you back to the main document selection screen. This has never happened prior to the Kindle Fire update. The good news about this crash (if you can call it that) is that while you are taken back to the initial document selection menu page, you can pick up right where you left off by simply re-selecting the document you was reading prior to the crash and you'll be right back in business. Hopefully a future update will address this issue.<br /><br />WARNING UPDATE: 02/02/12<br />After using ezPDF Reader with the newest Kindle Fire update (6.2.2), I can say that the problem with the recent crashes I was experiencing above is no longer present.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />I have the Kindle Fire and the built-in PDF reader in just plain horrible. I'm not even going to go into the details but just trust me, it's not ideal for reading long PDF books and documents. Being that I bought the Kindle Fire mainly to read PDF documents and technical ebooks, I was highly disappointed. When I found out that you can easily sideload apps to the device, I was giddy with joy because I was sure there would be at least one free PDF app out there that would satisfy my needs.<br /><br />PDF reading apps I have tried on the Kindle Fire so far:<br /><br />Adobe Reader (no sideload required)<br />Aldiko<br />Documents to Go (no sideload required, got it free from Amazon's app-of-the-day)<br />APV PDF Viewer<br /><br />There were a couple of others that I can't remember the names of because I deleted them immediately after finding out they are horrible as well. Also, there were many others I would loved to have tried but couldn't because I couldn't find the .apk files for them. Anyways, I was finally fed up and decided to pay for a professional PDF reader for my Kindle Fire. I saw the good reviews for ezPDF Reader here on Amazon and for only $2.99, I thought to give it a try. After using it for a couple of hours or so, my mission to find the perfect PDF app has finally been accomplished. No way am I going to use anything else from here on out!<br /><br />ezPDF Reader has all the features I could possible want and much, much more. It loaded my most heavy PDF documents with ease. I need to copy a lot of notes and URL links in my PDF into Evernote and so I was glad to find out how smooth highlighting text were in this app. Another big feature missing in many of the readers I've tried is bookmarks! Something so simple yet overlooked. Well, this app got it covered. Features like night-reading mode, text reflow, link support, annotations and even Text-to-Speech makes this killer app a must have if you're serious about using your Kindle Fire to consume PDF documents. Also, ezPDF actually remembers your last visited page and immediately takes you back to it when you re-open the app (yes, even after a shut down)! This is a huge time saver when you are reading documents well over the 800-900 page mark. With the Adobe Reader app, I had to manually scroll back to the last page I was on whenever the app closed. Forgot what page you were on? Too bad.<br /><br />This was the best $2.99 I've ever spent on any app. I feel bad for the users who have purchased this app only to have it misbehave on their device of choice.

1451627289|5.0|When Stephen King is on his game it's like watching Tiger Woods when he was in his prime.  There is simply no one, past or present, who does what he does better.  I'm happy to report that after fifteen years of frustratingly uneven work which demonstrated only brief flashes of his early career brilliance, 11/22/63 is the novel which resoundingly reasserts King's place as Grand Master of the art.  This is his finest work of fiction since The Green Mile.    Like Kings previous novels, The Dead Zone and The Green Mile, 11/22/63 centers around a protagonist called upon to do extraordinary things in the midst of leading an ordinary, unremarkable life.  In the case of 11/22/63, the events center around the assasination of John F. Kennedy and the efforts of the protagonist to alter this watershed moment in United States history.    11/22/63 is a genre mash up which in the hands of a lesser author (or even the Stephen King of five years ago) might have quikly turned absurd and unbelievable. However, 11/22/63 turns out to be an expertly woven tale which incorporates elements from science fiction, alternate history fiction and romance and even manages to throw in a side order of 1940's style road film.   11/22/63 gets five stars from me, but that's not to say it is without flaw.  Like most of King's work of late, it's a bit longer than neccessary.  There are also occasional descriptions of events in the book which drag on too long and cause the story to briefly bog down.  It's hard to care much about this novels minor flaws though when the characters come to life so brilliantly and the over all story is so original and down right riveting.  Put 11/22/63 on your shopping list.  You'll be glad you did.

1576875776|5.0|I've been waiting for the work of this obscure, solitary street photographer to make it to book form. As with most of us who have followed this story in blogs and news reports--and have had our interests piqued with low-res, sporadically-posted online images--I have been titillated by possibility of seeing Ms. Maier's work in a form that would really allow us to appreciate this quiet master of the street photography genre. This book does not fail to deliver. It is a joy. The physical size of the book, the size of the images, the quantity of images, the image selection, and the printing provide a wonderful introduction to Maier's effort. It is really a pleasure to have the chance to sit with these images, to enjoy how they reach across the decades and pull you back in time, and to see a whole new body of work from a time period that is arguably the heyday of the genre. Enjoy!
0312427565|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for a long time. The story was very engrossing, well written and addicting. I will say that I was a bit disappointed that it stopped before man goes to the moon, but considering the amount of research that went into this book, I can't imagine how much longer that would have taken.<br /><br />The book itself provides very good characterizations of the original astronauts, and makes you feel like you know who they are and how they will react in each scenario. I was also impressed with the detail in which Wolfe describes many of the astronauts home lives as it does not seem like it would be the easiest information to gather.<br /><br />These rich characterizations do not apply only to the astronauts, however. Wolfe also provides vivid details on the implied/perceived hierarchies within the armed services as well as colorful scenes which really help to imbue fighter pilots/test pilots in general as a lot of daring, crazy, and above all else brave folks who are willing to put their life on the line in order to push the envelope of what is considered achievable.<br /><br />At the end of the book you are left not only with a sense of the obstacles that the space program had to overcome within the armed services to be taken legitimately, but also you are left with a much stronger respect for the AF/Navy/Army pilot who takes his plane over a dry southern california desert uncertain if the controls are going to work, how the plane is going to handle in extremely conditions, or whether or not this will be his last flight.

B001HN6922|2.0|First off let me say that I didn't think that Cars needed a sequel.  It was by far not my favorite Pixar film but it had its charms and everything wrapped up well in the end and Mcqueen learned a lesson about friendship...or did he?  Well apparently he didn't but that fact doesn't even take center stage in this film.  Instead we get a James Bond spoof with Mater taking center stage with two spy cars and all of the charming characters from Radiator Springs get put in almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />Of course the visuals are stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my boys interested and my oldest even asked to watch something else about three times starting only 10 minutes into the movie.  One of my younger ones disappeared and returned with the original movie asking to watch it instead.<br /><br />Not a terrible film but Pixar can certainly do better.

0553801473|4.0|*Update*<br />I've noticed many of the 1-3 star reviews are written by individuals who either skipped entire chapters in this book, didn't finish the book, or in some extreme cases, didn't read A Feast for Crows.  I appreciate the full disclosure, but I don't believe that a reviewer can offer a meaningful, credible review without completing the reviewed work in its entirety.  I read both AFFC and ADWD completely, and I enjoyed both books.  Not everyone will enjoy them, but I imagine that anyone who skips whole chapters, or even whole books, will, without exception, write a negative review.  You would have to be critical of it before even starting to skip some of the stories, and skipping passages would likely not improve your opinion.  I found that characters I cared nothing about before starting this book, like Victarion Greyjoy, became some of my favorites; I would never have known these plots would come to interest me had I skipped chapters I didn't eagerly await.  Similarly, had I skipped AFFC, I would never even have come in contact with Victarion before starting ADWD.<br /><br />--<br />Review:<br /><br />Martin should have cut the book off as soon as the timelines from AFFC and ADWD converged chronologically.  Or, alternatively, completed some of the timelines that end abruptly -- and in some cases, with an easily discernable next step -- instead of truncating them at 15-30% completion. The former would have made a shorter -- but still long!  -- book; the latter would have made a substantially longer -- but better -- book.<br /><br />Massive spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Some of the plotlines that should have been carried through:<br /><br />1. Cersei's trial.  Ser Robert Strong will certainly win.  (And in the same vein, it's fairly clear that Ser Robert Strong is a resurrected or preserved Ser Gregor Clegane.)<br />2. Aegon's attack on Storm's End.<br />3. Barristan's battle at Meereen.<br />4. Victarion's arrival in Meereen.  Why end with him floating in the straits?<br />5. Bran's further learning from Bloodraven.  Seemed to end abruptly, in the middle of the teaching.<br />5. Theon and Jeyne's time in Stannis' camp, from Theon's viewpoint.<br /><br />I'm glad that certain other plots ended where they did, as the ending clearly segued into the next segment.  They are:<br /><br />1.  Jon's possible death.  I think it likely Melisandre will heal him, as the red priests clearly possess this power, but it's a good, natural finish.<br />2.  Arya's completion of training at the Temple of Black and White.  Her tutelage with her first mentor is a good beginning for her story in the next book.<br />3. Davos' setting off for Skagos.  This storyline will begin (and hopefully end) in TWOW.<br />4. Tyrion's solicitation of the Second Sons.  We don't know his plans, but it's a good finish to his time in Meereen.<br />5. Quentyn's death.  Seems apt.<br />6. Lady Nym setting off for King's Landing.<br />7. Daenerys' rescue/capture by Khal Jhoqo and Mago.<br /><br />I'm also glad Martin left certain stories out entirely.  They will make for interesting plots in the next book.  They are:<br /><br />1.

1576875776|4.0|Only thing holding back a 5-star review is the appearance of blank pages randomly scattered throughout the book.  No explanation for them, nor a reason, that I can think of.  Looks like a printer's error but seems to be deliberate.   Why?  The photographs themselves, however, are amazing.  The paper stock is good quality, thick, just a slight gloss.    Introduction is sparse, but not much is known about the photographer, so that's understandable.

B0028IDXDS|2.0|First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the monkey is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.    Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the monkey.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.  Third, the monkey is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the monkey doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the monkey into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|No, it was not the first catapult assault game.  It is however, the most popular by far.  Pretty much a no-brainer to play, but can get tricky to get all the stars and hidden items.  I don't think more time has been killed by any other app.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I couldn't wait to read this book, and also see the X Ray feature. It's kinda cool to look up people, but thankfully I noted that it let you find items in the book's index if you looked towards the end of the graph. An easy way to get to the index, how cool! But then, when I got there, the index was formatted incorrectly, with the subheadings outdented as if they were main headings. I can't believe the publishers didn't check this formatting. Confusing and really reflects badly on the publisher. I use indexes heavily, and this one is so confusing, just because of formatting issues. Every entry has links, so obviously they went to some trouble to make the index active, but didn't check to see if it displayed correctly.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thor is an incredibly well done movie. The special effects were much better than I expected to them to be and I also think that the story line was very well thought out. I have always been interested in Norse Mythology and while the movie does not follow that precisely I can forgive the small changes that they made. The two major male characters, Thor and Loki, each go through a very thorough development during the movie and by the end you can really understand the decisions that Thor and Loki make. Very well done movie, I would recommend to anyone.
1451627289|4.0|I'm not sure what I can add that other readers have not already commented on, but here goes. The premise is good. There are a lot of holes in the story if you look carefully- probably could have been taken care of with a thorough editing.  One minor but typical example would be Al's purchasing of an entire day's worth of meat for his restaurant back in 1958 and bringing it back to the present...in one trip and completely by hand. Granted, time-travel is hard to swallow, but at least get the details to be believable.  It's hard to believe Al would be able to purchase a day's worth of meat and haul it up the stairs back into the present. Or why Al trusts Jake so much to reveal the secret of the bubble to Jake only, and why he is so obsessed with changing history.I think that the book could have been trimmed by a couple hundred pages and probably not lost any luster. I'll try and stay spoiler-free, but the first event in the past Jake changes (in Derry) reads great, as does his relationship with Sadie. The Oswald stuff got very repetitive and monotonous until the very end, which was engrossing. I liked the glimpse into the \\"what-if\\" scenario after Jake changes history. Perhaps what I liked best though, was the ending, which was pretty endearing and just a little sad.

0307593312|5.0|At 925 pages, 1Q84 is a very long novel that doesn't feel long.  Both because it covers less than a year and because the main characters, Tengo and Aomame don't evolve.  They become clearer about what matters to them but they don't develop in the way you would expect of characters in a long novel. It is significant that Aomame is reading Proust because time is fluid and deceptive in 1Q84 both because of how the action unfolds but also in the reading of the book.  On one hand I knew it took a long time to read but on the other hand time seems to have disappeared.<br /><br />A synopsis of this book would read as follows: Aomame a part-time assassin and full-time masseuse enters slightly alternative world and is on a mission to kill leader of a sinister cult. Still in love with a boy she briefly held hands with in elementary school she searching for him to re-kindle the love affair.  Tengo, a math teacher and writer, re-writes a fable-like novel that becomes a huge bestseller and leads him to be threatened by the same cult whose leader Aomame is to kill.  Tengo is also in love with Aomame and realizes as well that he must find her.<br /><br />Only a writer of incredible power could take this material and transform it into an unforgettable tale of mystery, magic and romance.  Despite being translated from Japanese into English, it still captures that other worldly, trance-like quality.  I am stumped at how Murakami is able to achieve this.<br /><br />The book is more than merely a strangely readable story.  It is a meditation on the mystery of love, a demonstration of how the creative process works, and even of the difficulty in holding on to judgments about facts when they suddenly shift in shape and meaning.  The characters are also strangely compelling.  Many facts about them get repeated again and again yet in such a way as to give these qualities a hypnotic effect on the reader.  For example, we are repeatedly told about one of the major character's misshapen head and after awhile that quality takes on a wide range of meanings and makes that character both deeply sympathetic and disgusting at the same time.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Murakami novel.  That would \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" which was so rich and evocative in way 1Q84 is not.  Still, this is one of handful of mind-altering novels I've read in the last decade.takes on a wide range of meanings and makes that character both deeply sympathetic and disgusting at the same time.  This is not my favorite Murakami novel.  That would \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" which was so rich and evocative in way 1Q84 is not.  Still, this is one of handful of mind-altering novels I've read in the last decade.
B006AN4Y2Q|5.0|This is a prime example of exellent British programming.  The special effects are terrific; the casting more than adequate; the screen writing very good.  Season 5 of the series is picking up pace from season 4.  The majority of the episode takes place on a British submarine under the ocean where very large predators from millions of years ago are attacking the crew and ARC team sent to close an under water anomaly.   If you like Science Fiction or just good action and adventure you will not be disappointed.  This could be the last year of thus series.  I hope not!  It's one of the better scifi's on British or U.S. TV.
B00402FGEE|5.0|I have watched the previous incarnations of the Stargate franchise (SG1 and Atlantis) and Universe in my opinion was by far the best of the three.  Some have criticised Universe season 1 as being rather \\"slow\\", I can understand this but from my perspective this relates as having to set up a number of issues. Many people are used to the procedural episode oriented formula of the previous franchises but I thought it was fantastic this was serialised. This archs and the storyline are largely a matter of a \\"slow burn\\" with this series, unfortunately it wasn't given the opportunity to follow through just as it was picking up speed given the Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) of the network involved.  Nevertheless, I thought it was great that the show explored firstly the challenges involved in the practical ongoing sustainability of life that people in such a situation would encounter. People have criticised the Episode \\"Life\\" as rather slow and boring, it does seem to drag on but it it articulating a very necassary issue of people having to grips with being in the situation they are in for the \\"long haul\\".  It may come across slow at times but I can see how it was necassary to tell the full story  I enjoyed how the series explores the sociological tension and fissures, that is even though the people onboard are from an erstwhile stable society, there is still a fascinating tension and struggle between the civilian population with their concept of \\"rights\\" of individual self determination applying a long way from home and the idea of ultimate \\"civilian leadership\\" being applicable and the Military personnel who feel the necessity for effective and decisive decision making structures given the situation they are in and the powerplays that would occur and ultimately the issues concerning the absolute necessity for both sides to work together.  I enjoyed the fact that the series departed from the typical simplistic \\"good\\" people being on \\"our\\" side and all of the \\"bad\\" people being on the opposing side. In this case Rush is absolutely nececassary but his self interest and temperament cause issues, similarly regarding the enemy there are issues of Varro being on integrity and value (although this is explored mostly in series 2).  While some found it frustrating, I like the fact that unlike previous franchises no one has any kind of \\"super hero\\" status and the show explores the human challenges that many people face, which for me gives the show much more depth and substance and makes the show richer  In terms of Blu-Ray, some of the visuals are fantastic, particularly in natural settings and all of this serves to compliment the outstanding special effects. I also enjoyed the more \\"peripheral\\" aspects such the the style of camera work etc  Overall a fantastic series and although it may seem a bit of a long shot at the current time I hope this series is re-visited again
B002BJGYV2|1.0|I watched the disc 1 with no issues however the disc 2 would not play at all I tried both DVD players in my house as well my two blu ray players as well as my computer and it just would not play . I took a good look at the disc and it looks like it has been handled alot as if it had been used before with lots of scratches. When I got the box set it was wrapped in plastic wrap so i had no reason to question weather or not it was new , until now.
B000000WJ4|5.0|What can you say about John Dawson Winter that hasn't already been said repeatedly?  Maybe \\"Yeaaaaaaaaaah Johnny!\\"  The unquestionable King of Blues Rock will reign long after his shade has passed from among us.  His driving clean pickin' and playin' are simply the best bar none.
0439023521|1.0|I picked up this book because I watched the trailer online and heard a lot of buzz about it so I thought the book might be worth reading but I've never been so disappointed. I didn't realize this book was going to be so geared toward young adults if not children. If I hadn't already read 1984 or seen Battle Royale I might find this book mildly intriguing and worth turning a few more pages but its far too simplified and boring. The dialogue is so bland and dull that it makes the characters empty and unreal to me. I hear a lot of comments about the story being completely unoriginal and I don't disagree but it disheartens me to think that eventually young people might read 1984 and compare it to this kind of haunted bubble-gum fantasy.
B000000WI6|5.0|Let me in is another great example of JDW's expertize and raw feeling for the music that he (and I) so obviously love.  Like all of his releases, there's not one bad cut.  He falls back into the realm of The Blues on occasion, but that's NEVER a downgrade on his releases, rather it's a reaffirmation of the roots of Blues Rock, and he ALWAYS delivers virtuoso performances no matter the genre.  I should add that my purchases of Johnny Winter CD's are replacements for many of his Vinyl LP's which were stolen from me in a house burglary in Florida.  All I can say is the thieves had good taste in music, as they took almost my entire collection.  The only ones they left me were at a friend's house on loan.  I want to add my thanks for the folks at Amazon for re-instituting the play list samples, they're a great buyer's tool.

B005OCFGTO|3.0|Pros:    -- You can get the DVDs before WB stops shipping them at the end of 2012.  -- You get all 8 movies in one box (they aren't in individual boxes like many sets).  Cons:   -- The only \\"optional material\\" is the trailer.  My DVD player always played the trailer before the movie.  -- Disk labels aren't all coordinated.  Some had pictures, some were black.    -- Compression problems in a couple of places (the picture lost detail/had moire/frame was short).
B003PPDIC4|5.0|I read this book in my teenage years and have since reread it a number of times. I think maybe because my understanding of the concepts become clearer each time. In a time where every sci-fi story leans on the elements of this film and later the book, its hard to remember that this came first. Perhaps the film is more memorable than the book due to its cinematic magnificence, the written story is worth a read as it helps the viewer understand better the confounding finale! A classic which will remain so for many years to come.
1594203059|4.0|This book is the effort of a distinguished historian to identify those things that have clearly shown themselves to work best for humanity, over the course of history; which by the way, he clearly explains, work just as well for people of any race or nationality (and to the converse, impoverishment and subordination of any peoples who chose ineffectual social structures).  Though anyone with any kind of an open, objective intellect will find it difficult to see this book as particularly politically incorrect, you can see from the other reviews, that it is apparently intimidating to people who seem to fear that it threatens their cherished orthodoxy of anti-capitalist anti-western, counter-cultural ideology. I am in favor of reviewers providing a warning of potentially politically-challenging material. I am offended when negative reviews such as: \\"Please don't read this book.\\" are posted, which seek to (metaphorically) \\"burn\\" a book to suppress the ideas contained therein. I will do the former by suggesting that if you simply cannot tolerate thoughts or observations which may not square with the arbitrary dogma of the leftist establishment, then you probably want to skip this book. For the rest of you, consider the \\"book burning\\" reviews to be a supreme endorsement of this tome: They wouldn't be so threatened if it weren't substantive, and compelling!   While the main thrust, and greatest accomplishment of this book is to expose the social behaviors and institutions that have, in actual historical fact, created the best living conditions for the greatest number of people in human history, and (attempt) to crystallize these into a comprehensible (and actionable) summary, I would have enjoyed the book JUST for the historical interest.   While I don't necessarily agree, or take as fact, every word of this, or any 13 hour reading, I found the historical review interesting, entertaining, and informative, and the author's conclusions both compelling, and useful.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Although The Hunger Games was outstanding, I had my doubts that Suzanne Collins could keep the suspense and tension going through a second book. She does it wonderfully though, at first by having the Capitol threaten Katniss- after all, they're not happy after how the Games ended, and then with a huge twist, which I can't really reveal, but you'll love. Besides, if I told you what it was, you'd say it was far-fetched and unbelievable, but it works.<br /><br />The first book was mainly about the games, and the fight for survival. Catching Fire gives us a much better understanding of the harrowing control the Capitol has on the citizens in the districts, and the creepy President Snow, who smells of blood and roses.<br /><br />There's a great sense of anticipation in this book. In many trilogies, the second book is the weakest, the least enjoyable, and it can seem like nothing happens. After all, the first book introduces the story and the characters, the third concludes it- what happens in the second?<br /><br />This book is every bit as strong as the first book though, if not more so. The first book was a little predictable. After all Katniss is the narrator, so no matter what horrible injuries she may suffer, you always knew she'd at least survive.<br /><br />This book is darker, more dystopian, more tense and less predictable, while retaining the great writing, premise and characters that made the first book great. There's a real sense of something bubbling under the surface, that the revolution President Snow fears so much just might happen.<br /><br />The one thing I noticed in this book, and when I think about it, it was there in The Hunger Games as well, is that Collins isn't great with dealing with the passing of time. When days are meant to have passed, it comes across like minutes, and takes a while for the passing of time to become apparent.<br /><br />Something similar happens in the action scenes, which come across as a hectic blur. I know there's fighting and dying and that it's not neat and organised and easily described, but I find I have no idea what's happened until afterwards, when Katniss recaps in her own mind.<br /><br />There is less violence, less bloodshed and less of the Games in this book, but there is more fear, more tension, more cliffhangers. While the first book introduced us to the Games, this one introduces us to the tyranny of the Capitol, and plants the seeds of revolution in our minds.g and dying and that it's not neat and organised and easily described, but I find I have no idea what's happened until afterwards, when Katniss recaps in her own mind.<br /><br />There is less violence, less bloodshed and less of the Games in this book, but there is more fear, more tension, more cliffhangers.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|For the last 3 years when I buy a digital copy I get a file on my computer to put on the device of my choice.  It used to be my ipod, now it is my ipad and ipod.  Warner Brothers is now trying to pull a fast one on us consumers thinking that every device we own has the ability to have some type of \\"app\\" and we have wireless everywhere we go.  I feel cheated.  And I am pissed.  To top it off, I thought \\"ultraviolet\\" was just some type of marketing ploy to have some extra features with the digital copy, only to find out it isn't a digital copy at all.  I just paid extra to watch a crappy intermittent streaming of a movie on their device of choice, not mine.  To add insult to injury, I bought not only one \\"ultraviolet\\" crap I bought three; (green lantern, Crazy Stupid Love and Harry Potter 7 pt 2).  I should have just bought directly from Apple.  This sucks.
B001CDZ40K|5.0|Of course Julia Child's great cookbook on Mastering the Art of French Cooking ranks near the top of any list.  After reading nearly 50 cookbooks in the last few months, I'm surprised at how easy she makes it look.    Child's cookbook reads like natural conversation, like a script from one of her television shows.  It's not hard to imagine her voice reading the recipes like prose.  It includes little commentary on cooking history, and not a lot of comparisons, but great descriptions of what to do, why to do it, and what mistakes to avoid.  And Julia Child writes with enough continuity to make it possible to enjoy reading this book a chapter at a time before going into the kitchen.    Prereading your recipes will help, because this book was not written with visual appeal in miind.  In a busy kitchen, the reader can find the layout a bit confusing and the text too dense to absorb at one glance.  Recipes continue from one page to the next.  Don't just flip this book open and pick something at random while standing in front of the stove.  Mastering the Art of French Cooking comes across as class lecture notes from the secret cooking class no one ever tells you about, not as a manual for cooking difficult foods.  For those like me without an innate sense of timing, her explicit directions on how to manage time add great value.  Armed with this book, most of us can cook spectacular meals with confidence.  This book belongs on the shelf of any adventurous cook, right next to Volume 2 which adds additional recipes and expands the first volume's discussions on soups, meat, chicken, vegetables, desserts and baking.  Together the two volumes cover over 1,000 recipes, including hundreds with French titles that sound very impressive.
B006G7R2KW|5.0|I have to say I have been alternately pissed and pleased with how shows have ended and this series has progressed.  At the very least it has been the most entertaining series I have ever watched.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Let me be the first to give it 5 stars. The Thing is a well made prequel, fx are done with cgi, but done well. Alien just like in 1982 can take on a form, but could not handle any kind of metal. Just like John Carpenter's film we get alot of cool transformation, eery background, and good acting. Rumors has it that it might be unrated for dvd and blu-ray, lets hope! But for some reason this movie got alot of negative reviews, don't know why, same thing happened to the 1982 version, but it's a known classic to horror, sci-fi fans. Big fan for horror remakes, and a big fan of The Thing 2011!!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|Definitely the best book after the Harry Potter series! Love the real primal character Katniss is.. she is etched out so well and pragmatic yet honest and real.. Brilliant work! Could not put it down and Cant wait to start Catching fire! Absolutely blown away!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT  I LOVED the first half of this book, over all I did like the book though. The second half I started to get really annoyed because of how on and off they were, because I knew they would get back together. I also did not like how it ended I though it was corny and unrealistic.   BUT..     Overall I loved the book. I loved all the dynamics of the family back ground and how much of a bad boy Travis is!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This cover is exactly as described and gives just enough protection to your Kindle so you can relax and take it with you wherever you want.  My favorite feature is that the entire face of the Kindle is exposed.  The Kindle is held securely by sides of the case.  With the case on and cover closed the overall thickness is barely increased.  If you need more protection than this, you might want to consider leaving your Kindle at home.
073934272X|5.0|I have had repeating nightmares about zombies about 2-3 times a week for about 2-3 years when I was a teenager. I would still have them when stressed out as an adult. In my nightmares - I always ran - yeah can out run them but have to rest and they would catch up. in my dream I was trying to avoid detection by hiding underneath an unanmiated corpse - but somehow the Z's would detect via ?heat-sense\\", heavy breathing or my heartbeat.<br /><br />Finally I figured a way to live with the zombies by relaxing and not getting upset  - tolerance of diversity - but a zombie would want to kiss me and I would have to start the running cycle all over again.<br /><br />After listening to this book - I had a dream about zombies last night. This time - I was running - I was killing zombies. I had two knives - the bigger one was not as sharp and took some time to slice the heads off with my right hand. the smaller one in my left hand was very sharpt and sliced much quicker. First time I dreamt of killing zombies instead of just running away from them.<br /><br />The audiobook is good therapy for those who has had repeating nightmares of feeling defenseless.
1451627289|4.0|Think I can only give 5 stars to REALLY classic faves... but this comes damn close. Certainly up there w/ King's best, which, imho, are MISERY, THE GREEN MILE, DIFFERENT SEASONS, and CARRIE... I just don't find a mis-step in this book. I too found myself reading deep into the night, I too was moved in parts (Mr. Amberson's first play production, etc.). The entertaining speculation on time travel blended w/ the mystery of the JFK assassination was top rate foreground material, but the wonderful descriptions of late 50s/early 60s and especially the layered love story was what really drew me in.  It's a long book, and, yes, a little slow in some spots. But, on the whole, the pace just added to the enjoyment.  I thought the ending worked: appropriate, but not predictable.  I'll remember this book for a long time.
1439102732|2.0|I thought this was better than some of her more recent books, such as \\"Home Rules\\" and that one about the girl with osteogenesis imperfecta (though perhaps this was because I was trapped on a flight without other reading matter), but it was still flawed by stereotypical characters and, of course, the requisite trial with the requisite surprising ending. I thought Zoe, while not a bad character, was unbelievable in a number of ways -- thinking that at 28 weeks her pregnancy was basically a done deal (most women with a past history of miscarriages and infertility tend to not relax at all til the baby's born, or at least until 32 weeks), and not expecting that Max would be fine and dandy with the idea of giving them rights to the embryos. Still, I keep on reading even though I'm disappointed, so that says something about Picoult's talents.

0060873027|1.0|Thin characterization and a contrived plot-line that is SO contrived that you can't even kid yourself that you are learning something about the potentials of modern scientific development.  It is so formulaic that you can almost check out the elements yourself -- HERE is the situation setting up where a group is going to be isolated in challenging circumstances; HERE is a description of the isolation area before you quite realize for sure how it is going to matter; HERE is the \\"bad guy\\" whose machinations are going to create the problem; HERE is the group of people who is going to be dealing with the challenging circumstances, each one type-cast to provide a certain angle (or humor) to the situation -- AND NOW, HERE WE GO.  Only I'm not going; I quit about 10% of the way in.  Too contrived.  Too thin.  Too overdone.  Terrible.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|The nearly 30 discs in this series are firmly secured inside the heavy cardboard pages of a coffee table book.  Sometimes it can be so hard to get the discs out you would think they were either nailed in, glued in, or you were pulling against the force of a vacuum.<br /><br />In this box set, the first four seasons are finally available in widescreen.  That may or may not be a good thing.  I've watched the first few seasons many, many times over the years on TV and in their original DVD presentations. (full-screen format).  Watching two of those episodes in widescreen now seems a bit disconcerting, really.  The camera work on the show has always been very \\"active\\", and in the different aspect ratio it draws even more attention to itself.  Your brain gets used to one thing and then it gets thrown a curveball.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Regardless of that, \\"The Shield\\" is one of the best and most well-written drama series of all time.  I've watched the whole series straight through a few times already and I never get tired of any of it.  It's compelling each time.<br /><br />If you already own the original release sets you won't get an overwhelming amount of new stuff with this one.  There's a brief video of footage of the set of the Barn being dismantled, but it's more depressing than fascinating.  But it's nice to have the option to watch seasons 1-4 in widescreen.  If the price is right, go for it.<br /><br />A question for the die-hard fans of the show:  in the very last scene of the final episode, do you think Vic settled into his new fate or do you think he's gonna buck the system yet again and not take his punishment lying down?
B004EI3ON4|5.0|The soundtrack to Tron: Legacy is a brilliant achievement for electronic music duo Daft Punk. The duo, known for their house and technopop productions, collaborated with music supervisor Jason Bentley and orchestrator Joseph Trapanese to create a score that merged orchestral music with electronic music. Their product is a brilliant soundtrack that marks a significant place in electronic music history.    The idea of merging orchestral music and electronic music has been popular for many years, but Tron: Legacy is by far one of the most successful attempts at this endeavor. For starters, the soundtrack is entertaining. It is an intense and enjoyable listen. Secondly, the score truly captures the tone and essence of the film. The piece mirrors the intensity, drama, and suspense expressed throughout the film. The movie takes place primarily in a futuristic, digital world. The piece sounds out-of-this-world and original without sounding like the cliché computer sounding music heard in many movies that surround around a futuristic or technology heavy theme.   In addition to creating a good soundtrack, Daft Punk's achievements with Tron: Legacy include their seamless fusion of electronic music with Trapanese's orchestral score. Rather than sounding choppy, the two different styles of music compliment each other. In \\"Solar Sailer,\\" synthesized tones and sequencers can be heard while a chorus of violins beautifully fills the background.   \\"The Game Has Changed\\" serves as another example of a great mixture of orchestral music and electronic music. Sequencers and granulized sound come in and out to compliment the music of the orchestra that's playing the meat of the song. At times, the orchestral music is distorted by technological means, adding a sense of suspense and to the song and continuing the digital theme present throughout the soundtrack and the film.  Throughout a listen of the entire soundtrack, one can hear everything from orchestral horns and violins to synthesized pianos and other computer sounds that can't truly be described by relation to a real instrument. Overall, the soundtrack is more orchestral music with subtle electronic lines in it, a fact that seems to displease many fans.   Daft Punk has been criticized for Tron: Legacy. Many fans miss Daft Punks old style (which can appropriately be described as creating new style) and accuse the duo of \\"selling out.\\" Listeners need to remember that this soundtrack is meant to be just that, a soundtrack. The score to a soundtrack of a film is not going to be the same as the music on an album that is meant to be listened to independently. A film's soundtrack is not going to sound like Daft Punk's famed Discover album. Daft Punk made a piece that follows the style of a film score because it is a film score and must operate in that capacity. With that being said, the piece is still quite original and their willingness to so close integrate electronic music with orchestral music is quite progressive and far from \\"selling out.\\"  Individuals like Iannis Xenakis, Robert Moog, and Max Mathews would be delighted to see the essential role that electronic music made in Tron: Legacy. Involvement of computer music in film has travelled a long way from \\"Daisy Bell\\" in 2001: A Space Odyssey and the trautonium in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Integrating synthesizers, sequencers, modulators, and other technological instruments with classical orchestral performers is no easy tasks, but Daft Punk executed it successfully. The duo should be applauded for their progressive, daring, and successful efforts.
0393064476|5.0|I loved Swerve because it gave me a real good idea of what life was like in the 1400s. Also, it gave me a good idea of what the Catholic Church and the people running it were like. There are many similarities between how we are today and how we were back in 100 A.D. and 1400 A.D.

The book was nothing like I had expected and the wacky way the author's characters were drawn was a little hard for me to accept.  However, the more I read the more I understood that these players were caricatures of the real-life insanities that many of us have experienced.    By the time I finished the book I felt a sense of loss that it had ended!  Wes Hill

1451648537|4.0|The book is much more than just a biography of Steve Jobs as it is also a history of computing during the PC era. As one who has worked in the industry for 35 years, this is truly fascinating reading. I absolutely loved the parts (majority) of the book where Jobs is Jobs and working his magic at Apple and Pixar (five stars). Conversely, I found the details of his personal life tedious and indeed boring. Overall however, it is well worth reading.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|M83 is an electronic/dream pop band manned mainly by French musician Anthony Gonzalez with help on different tracks from a large group of musicians, vocalists, and programmers.  Throughout his recent album, \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\", the main motif that comes to mind is the feeling behind the word \\"dream\\".  Every song on this album evokes a dreamy aura, with every song seemingly flowing into one another.  Yet at the same time, each song has its own mood.  At times, the sound is upbeat, and at others they are more chill, introspective.  How does Gonzalez do this?  He brings a sort of nostalgia to the album bringing to mind the sounds of the '80s, new wave, along with more recent bands who have followed a similar idea such as MGMT or The Naked and Famous.  \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\".  M83 uses many techniques and styles of the '80s, such as the heavy use of synthesizers.  Perhaps one of the most explicit examples of the nostalgia childlike feeling Gonzalez is going for is in \\"Raconte-Moi Une Histoire\\".  The track starts out with a computer music sounding beat, almost like in a video game.  Then the voice of a small child narrates a story about a \\"very tiny\\" \\"but also very special\\" frog.  As the story develops, more instruments join in, becoming less electronic, with an acoustic joining in, yet the electronic beat is there, with more noise yet softer, creating a mellow yet upbeat(if that's even possible) atmosphere.  On to the album's first single, \\"Midnight City\\" - the track starts with an organ in the background along with a loud almost piercing(not quite) synth beat.  Then another synthesizer joins in picking up the beat and you just feel the music rise, going into the main really upbeat pop melody.  The song is very pop sounding with a party feel to it.  Yet it still manages to hold on to that dreamy quality.  It also brings back that '80s sound with that awesome sax - oh the nostalgia again.  Another track I enjoyed was \\"Splendor\\".  Starting out with only a piano, it moves into a modulated voice with an acoustic guitar, then is accompanied by the sound of a choir.  The main melody then is taken over by a synthesizer.  The synthesizer although a little less smooth, than the acoustic instruments, definitely brings a childlike quality to the song.  It's got a very angelic quality to it.  A great song with Gonzalez using the background instruments to take the song to another level.  My first run through of this album, I was like, cool sound but whatever. But like with many of my favorite bands, I gave it a couple listen throughs and have really come to love it.  What I really like about this album is that it really utilizes synthesizer rhythms in every song to define the mood, rather than just letting it support the lead vocals.  It's a nice change of pace and that ambience just really gets the idea of \\"dreaming\\" across.    The indie electro ambient sound that M83 creates in \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\" really does follow along with some increasingly popular music today and I feel like M83 has taken it to the next level in terms of experimenting with different synths and with incorporating narration and different.  M83 brings back that 80s sound but brings a newer feel new direction to it, not completely ripping off of it.  I think M83 has done an excellent job here.

0765348276|3.0|This book started strong with an interesting introduction of the main character and premise; it dropped off from there but maybe my expectations were too high from all the glowing reviews.  It was fun but not a great book. What wasn't great? While there were a few stereotyped characters most of the secondary characters were simply thinly drawn. When one died, I had a hard time remember exactly which character it was and why I was supposed to care. The dialogue frequently seemed stilted to me and often served as the repository for a lot exposition. Every time a leader said \\"You get me?\\" and the grunts replied \\"We get you\\"  my brain automatically added \\"sir\\", as in line from the Starship Troopers movie. The aliens were truly cartoonish as were the battle sequences whose gore quickly became blaise. There's also the fact that the protagonist is both extremely lucky and extremely capable to the point of no discernible flaws.  With all that, why did I enjoy it? It's hard to put my finger on it. It was a nice, quick read with a main character who was appealing enough. You knew it was all going to work out better than it should but it was still interesting to see what was going to happen. Maybe it just reminded me of all the science fiction novels I read in my youth, not all of them well written but most of it entertaining.  My recommendation is to set your expectations for something light but entertaining and enjoy it for what it is. I do plan on getting the next book. As for my rating, I can't quite bring myself to give it a 4 but it's more than a 3. It's one of those times I'd really like to give a 3.5
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is not what I expected.  I am a fan of the original theatric versions.  I didn't know that the three original films have been extensively reedited with MAJOR changes from the theatrical versions.  Probably fans if the later series knew.  Amazon's review noted the changes, but only at the end of the review.  If they had prominently addressed this, I would have no complaints.  I ordered before the onslaught of negative reviews altered people to the contents.  I will probably return the set claiming not as advertised.
B004GGQMTW|5.0|I'm not sure why anyone would classify this as a feminist movie, it's in the  female buddy action genre; a counterpart to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It's photography is stunning, the acting is nothing short of brillant; both Sarandon and Davis play so well off each other it's a wonder any director hasn't paired them up again.  The only issue I have with this movie, and it's no minor one, is the motivation Thelma (Geena Davis) has about getting with JD (Brad Pitt).  Yes, he's Brad Pitt, but she was essentially raped not 24 hours before so to me, it's not believable that she would willingly be intimate with another guy so quickly.  A rather small plot point, which I overlook, but it nags at me as being utterly unbelievable.   The men: Keitel, Pitt, McDonald, Madsen, Tobolowsky all play different types in the story and they're all great, particularly Keitel as the sole individual who earnestly wants to help the ladies from their predicament,
B004SBX112|5.0|I bought all three Ad-Free versions and they are all great. Ignore any reviewer who says they have ads, I assure you they do not. I suspect those reviews purchased the free version and returned to the incorrect item to leave their review. I'm using an AT&T Samsung Galaxy SII.
B0065IA4F2|5.0|I was planning on getting this album eventually, but when Amazon ran a $2 sale on it--I couldn't help but pick it up. And I'm shocked. I feel like I finally get what all the big hoopla about Drake is now.<br /><br />Before I've never really been a fan of his soft \\"not really singing but kind of\\" voice that he has on a lot of his old stuff. It's not rap and it just didn't appeal to me. But on this album--I'm not really sure whether it's because the music is so much better or if a little light bulb in my head got turned on, but I found myself wanting him to \\"sing\\" more than actually rap.<br /><br />\\"Crew Love\\" is just so sic. The chorus has been on repeat in my head for days now. It's a really solid album-but it does lack a little range, so if you don't like the singles--you're not going to like the album. For me though, Drake just picked up a new fan.
B005M4N060|5.0|Its been a while since Ive read this book, and its been a while since Ive found any other book comparable. I am writing this in hopes of suggestions from others and recommendations for similar types of stories. To me this had all the right elements for an excellent story and I want to find more like it. Id love to hear any/all suggestions:)
B0002KQNUO|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time probably. The vocalists are ridiculously talented and the music is modern and edgy yet still beautiful. \\"Querer\\" (Track 4) is hypnotic, and Francesca Gagnon (the vocalist) manages to impart so much emotion and pure sex into it that it will probably still be one of my favorite songs when I'm 80 years old. That's what this music is--transcendent to time.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|We can get into discussions all day and night long on what's the best movie of all time really is.  The Godfather and Toy Story, without question, are the best trilogies.  Yet if you have to talk about a single movie that defines breaking the mole of true picture telling and movie making then The Shawshank Redemption takes the prize.  Now, as a fan of Forrest Gump, I never questioned whether it should had won a Best Picture Oscar, nevertheless, after finally watching Shawshank I'm beginning to think otherwise.  I've always enjoyed Stephen King films for their psychological thrill, this on the other hand has to be the most unique and fanastic piece of storytelling and character development in his career.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gives flawless peformances playing incarcerated inmates who develop a friendship behind bars.  For 2 hours and 22 minutes this movie will have you captivated by the richness and cleverness of the film.  Simply outstanding!  And if you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you do.

B000002G6J|5.0|I have been a fan of bossa nova since I was a junior in high school. This is truly a \\"classic.\\"  It features several Jobim standards, along with some lesser known pieces.  It is arranged and conducted by Claus Oberman, who worked with Sinatra in his first bossa nova session.  It was originally recorded in 1967, when bossa nova was at it's peak in this country.  This recording is, in a word - superb.  It is over 40 years old, but has easily stood the test of time.  It is the essence of \\"cool\\" Brazilian jazz. I feel completely confident that I will listen to this for, literally, as long as I live. It is wonderful.

030726839X|5.0|This author has been on somewhat of tear as of late, this his third World War II book published in the last seven years, (Armageddon and Retribution the other two), and a fourth volume just out. Winston's War also adds to the recent spate of books - Carlo D'Este's Warlord; Andrew Robert's Hitler and Churchill and Masters and Commanders, and Berthon and Potts', Warlords - \\"analyzing\\" Churchill's leadership role and his success/failure as Great Britain's Commander in Chief. Hastings' new book differs from these previous Churchill book specifically in its focus - this book is all Churchill and all WWII, and is another excellent addition to the history of both.<br /><br />First a brief note on Hastings' \\"writing style\\". The author has seemingly read everything available - first-hand accounts from diaries and letters, newspaper accounts, military archives and records, etc. - and combined all this research/data into a very compelling, insightful, extremely well written account. The author is also anything but subtle. In this book for instance, Henry \\"Chips\\" Cannon is described as the \\"consummate ass\\" and that Lord Gort, although personally courageous - \\"lacked brains\\" - this within the first 25 pages. The point here is that Hastings does not mince words and is never shy about voicing his educated opinion - including about Churchill.<br /><br />Winston's War picks up on May 10th, 1940, as Churchill assumed the premiership - \\"The Phony War\\" in Europe coming to an end with the Nazi Army mobilizing. Thus begins Churchill's heroic struggle to save his country and the world from Hitler's tyranny - and what a story it is. Hastings chronicles the dark yet heroic days of 1940-41 when Churchill and his countrymen stood alone; the partnership with Stalin and FDR after Barbarossa and Pearl Harbor; and as odd man out of The Big Three as events, Soviet man-power and American war production passed Churchill and his country by. And as Hastings painstakingly points out there was plenty ofChurchillian good and bad - decisions and behavior - during these war years, for Winston packed a half dozen lifetimes worth of activity in these busy years, which in and of itself was all part of a very busy and active life.<br /><br />This book is by no means a hatchet-job or even to a lesser degree - revisionist history. The author makes it very clear that the same qualities that propelled Churchill through the crisis of the early years of WWII are the same that frustrated his military men and his allies throughout the war's later years - Churchill was always Churchill - and the world is a better place for that.<br /><br />There is a treasure trove of information here not to be missed - An excellent book and highly recommended.
0545140323|4.0|Penny Lane is a quirky and fun girl who had the cutest little relationship with her parents' best friends' son. And everything was going well until he was a jerk! Now Penny Lane is heartbroken and has sworn off boys. And when other girls who are in similar situations hear about her ban of the boys, they want to join in. So what will come from all this girl power? Is it all too much?<br /><br />This book is so cute. I adored Penny Lane throughout the entire thing and although she is a little oblivious to the world around her, I found her endearing. Can I also say THANK YOU to Ms. Eulberg for making girl characters who, in some situations, could have been bratty but weren't. From the ups and downs of relationships, friendships, and high school live in general, Ms. Eulberg got the overall feeling of a heartbroken teenage girl PERFECT.<br /><br />And while this is definitely more character driven, I know that I was waiting for that \\"big moment\\", the one where realization dawns on Penny Lane and the story is wrapped up perfectly.<br /><br />If you're a fan of feel-good books, this is one to read!
0765350386|4.0|When giving praise to Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss (author of the King Killer Chronicles) once said that Brandon clearly missed the job working for big name comic books. After reading a wonderfully refreshing book like Mistborn, you can see why. As far as super powers go (and I use the term loosely here) the abilities of the Allomancers rivals that of our richest super hero mythologies, and as far as magic systems go, it rivals that of Robert Jordan's the One Power in the Wheel of Time series by way of sure ingeniousness alone. It's just that brilliant. This story is dying to be made into a comic book series (if you are in the comic book industry, PLEASE PLEASE give Mr. Sanderson a call!). After a stint of reading lesser fantasy books, I heard of Robin Hobb's praise of Brandon Sanderson and immediately familiarized myself with his body of work. And while I usually read an author's first break out novel before anything else, I decided to skip Elantris for now and read Brandon's best known work, the Mistborn trilogy. As it turned out, this will be the series that has Brandon up there with the Martins, Jordans, and Eriksons of the heavyweight fantasy hall of fame. I often say in my reviews that I'm not a HATE IT 1 star reviewer, or LOVE IT 5 star reviewer, but I must admit, this is really pushing the LOVE IT reviewer in me. I give it 4.5 out of 5, and here's why.  The front Mistborn page on Amazon summarizes the story, so I'll explain why I wholly recommend this novel.    Pros:  The magic system (Allomancers Assemble!)- Okay, so I've already talked about this, but give me a moment to gush here. If your looking for a new and refreshing magic system, look no further. The idea of Allomancers and Mistborn burning metals to gain super human abilities is highly remarkable, I can't stress this enough. The beauty of it is its uncanny ability to be both strange and very natural at the same time. Brandon Sanderson describes in an interview that it comes from the idea ofhumans burning our foods into sugars then proteins that allows us to move throughout the day. The uncanny part is the consumption of metal, but it's written and executed in such a human way that you'll often stop and wonder to yourself (if I take a bite of my quarter could I fly off rooftops too?!)--Believe me when I say, 'no, you won't.' But, you will honestly believe you can after reading about Kelsier and Vin doing it.  The World of Mistborn (Give us a world worth fighting for)- The great part of Brandon Sanderson's writing is his masterful hold on world building. After reading the prologue alone, it will seem as if you're walking the ash filled streets of Luthadel, looking up at a blood red sun in the sky, watching the soot fall like black snow. His attention to detail is superb, and it fills you with this sense that you really would like to see things change for the better. Its almost as if Brandon builds a sympathy for the world itself, as it seems as much enslaved as many of the skaa people that inhabit it. The rituals of the nobles are also fully realized, and the small thing that I loved the most were the religions that Sazed knew about it.   The characters (A world is only as interesting as those inhabiting it)- I might get some flak here, but I didn't find the characters to be cookie cutter at all, like many other reviewers. Vin and Kelsier are both fully fleshed out, but it's because they are the focus of the story. I loved everything about Kelsier from the very beginning. He's humble yet brazen at the same time, he's courageous, and actually really funny, something you don't see very much in fantasy. Vin is vulnerable and you feel bad for her, but I didn't particularly like her at the beginning. But this was intended, she needed to learn how to trust, and when she begins to, she gains your sympathy by the reader wanting to be in her shoes, flying over building tops and hollering in joy. I feel like Breeze, Ham, and the others were supposed to be flat in this book, but just because they're flat doesn't make them 'cookie cutter'. They are accents in the story, they move things along, but they are rendered well enough to be entities with their own weight. I also disagree with what people say of the dialogue. I didn't feel it too self explanatory. Better to understand what's going on than to be confused. It's just fine.  The con(s):  The plot (Atium's 11)- There is really only one gripe I had in this novel, and its plot related. I felt the story had a lot of build up, but largely did nothing with it (and there is one particular part where the suspense does build--when the crap hits the fan--but then falls flat) not until the end at least, which had me throwing the book in nervousness. I have heard many times that this was a heist novel, but oddly enough, there was very little heisting to be had. I liked Vin's excursions into the nobility, but I wanted to see what the others were up to. The only time we do see what Breeze, Ham and the others are doing, they only train Vin with her powers. The heist part had to do with the 11th metal (Ocean's 11 reference? Maybe) and I really enjoyed the mystery behind it. Halfway through the novel turned into something else, but I was willing to forgive it because this is the first book.  And that's the brilliant part. This book covers in one novel what many fantasy stories take 5 books to complete. It takes the peasant boy and dark lord cliche and flips it on its head, that's the real beauty of Mistborn. Overall, read this book, read it as quickly as you can. I guarantee you, you won't regret it.

B002ZG97M4|2.0|Not without its moments - actors Kenny Wormald (Ren) and Miles Teller (Willard) have good chemistry, especially their first meeting (which plays out like a \\"meet cute\\") - and there's some clever re-imagining of the classic songs, but overall too poorly motivated and too contrived to earn my \\"but in\\" to the movie.  I mean, Rusty is obviously into Ren when she sees him and she's a way better choice than Ariel as a girlfriend but then all of a sudden out of nowhere Rusty and Willard are together? Where did that come from? Just needed to get the good girlfriend out of the way so the hero ends up with the girl the script calls for without looking like a total idiot for passing up the good girlfriend?
B005J4TLO8|3.0|\\"30 Minutes or Less\\" is a broad comedy focusing on Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), a small-town pizza delivery guy who leads a dull life until he is kidnapped by wanna-be criminals Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson).  Dwayne wants to hire a Detroit hitman (Michael Pena) to murder his millionaire father (Fred Ward), but the hit will cost $100,000.  Awakening with a bomb strapped to his chest, Nick is told he has ten hours to rob a bank and bring back $100,000 or Dwayne will detonate the bomb.      At a mere 83 minutes, the movie flies by at a frenetic pace.  Director Ruben Fleischer (\\"Zombieland\\") is adept at crafting comic action sequences.  Aziz Ansari as Chet -- Nick's former best friend who tries to help him out of a tough predicament -- steals the show with his wide-eyed expressions, manic behavior, and hysterical babbling.  Eisenberg plays a variation of his likable nerd but seems a bit adrift and never fully inhabits his character.    There is a sense of ad-libbing throughout that comes off flat, unfunny, and desperate, suggesting director Fleischer didn't have a lot of faith in the script.  The film is rated R due to crude language, nudity, and violence.  Blu-ray extras include a making-of featurette, picture-in-picture video commentary with actors and director, deleted scenes, and outtakes.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a GREAT shell for the Fire. Fits nice and snug, it will not fall out. The stand works great, sits up nicely, I will most likely never use this feature of the case though. The cover is well made and of great construction. There is hardly any weight difference added to the fire when the case is used. Covers the screen and has a nice hard protection for the back. I purchased the white cover, looks good. I like the feel and lack of added weight. Everything about this case is well made in my opinion.
0061980269|4.0|I bought this book because I had downloaded \\"Hey, Boo...\\" which discusses the story in detail.  Except I realized that, even though I am intimately familiar with the movie, characters and plot details are discussed with which I am unfamiliar.  Then it occurred to me -- I had never read the book.  I wanted to download it to my ipod or Kindle -- no such luck. Which is my only complaint.  So, when my desire to read the book overcame my need for a high tech version, I bought the book.  At least the publisher is accomodating enough to produce a large print version.  BTW, enjoyed every word.

If you are an aspiring hobbyist musician / producer / engineer like me, do not hesitate a second - just get it.

098357670X|5.0|Well, looky here!  Tom Richmond's The Mad Art of Caricature has landed at my desk, and it really is something special.  Nice printing (it's good to see Richmond's art on clear, glossy paper, as opposed to screens and pulpy printing), brilliant information, diagrams, tips and observations that are really well communicated - and colour-coded tabs for easy referencing.  Tom is easily one of the best cartoonists working today, and we've seen his great teaching skills over the last few years in the form of online tutorials.  His digital colouring tutorial changed the way I approached colouring my work, and I would take a punt that The Mad Art of Caricature will become the modern caricaturists' bible; a valuable asset to amateurs and pros alike.  I've certainly learned a thing or two.  Well done, Tom.
014241543X|5.0|Mia lives with her parents and younger brother,Teddy.  Her parents were total punk rockers when they were younger, but that's not Mia's scene.  She's a classical girl and plays the cello.  So it's even more surprising when she falls for a rocker.  Everything is great until...  Mia's family is in a terrible accident - her parents are killed immediately, she and Teddy go to different hospitals.  Mia's left between life and death, with a decision to make, stay or go.  The story goes back and forth between the hospiatl - what Mia sees and hears - and her life before.  I love Mia.  She's dedicated to her music, yet has a well-rounded life.  She's fun, spontaneous, selfish, worried...all the things that real girls are.  This isn't just a story about Mia and her choosing to stay or go.  It's a love story.  See, her boyfriend, Adam is at the hospital and he's begging her to stay.  Can she leave Adam behind? Adam, who understands her and her music?  Adam, who truly gets her?  It's a difficult choice and she doesn't have long to decide.  This book made me cry.  Not just cry, but actually sob.  Just writing the review made me cry.  An absolutely stunning book, NPR's The Roundtable said it best, \\"This is an achingly beautiful story.\\"

0525422943|5.0|While IF I STAY was Mia's story, WHERE SHE WENT is Adam's story.   It's been three years since Mia recovered from the accident and left for Julliard...and Adam hasn't seen or heard from her since.  Adam's band, Shooting Star, has taken off and is touring internationally.  Not bad for a small-town rocker, eh?  But Adam is having a rough time - he takes anxiety medication, barely talks to the band and doesn't even stay in the same hotel or travel with them anymore.  He thinks about Mia all the time - how she left, what went wrong - even though he's dating/living with a high-profile actress.   A chance sighting of a poster on the streets of NY will change everything for Adam.  He doesn't know it yet, but he's getting ready to make one of the biggest decisions of his life.  While this book didn't make me cry like IF I STAY did, it made me look at the relationship from Adam's point of view.  I found myself thinking \\"Dammit, Mia, what was wrong with you?!\\"  There's always two sides, y'know?  This was an amazing sequel and I can't imagine it any other way.  Gayle Forman definitely captured my heart with Mia and Adam!
B000OEZ88G|4.0|Why does the book contain studies and reviews of almost exclusively U.S. companies?  Perhaps the framework is flawed because it does not apply to other cultures such as Asia, or Europe.  Maybe Asian and European companies did not make the top list of visionary companies.  The authors only touched on it in a short paragraph.  I feel that in today's flattened and globalized world, these concerns should be addressed more concretely.  This way, the framework would be much stronger after knowing the reasons of why the list of companies is mainly US companies.  Perhaps an additional chapter or two to elaborate on the notion that the framework of visionary companies is not cultural bound would be more valuable.   It seems that the authors avoid the context of culture. For example, on the dimension of uncertainty avoidance, a study found that \\"France and Russia were high; Hong Kong and the United States were low\\".  Collins and Porras would not contend that values are different between cultures or between companies of different cultures.  However, they would contend that visionary companies, whether in Asia or in Europe or anywhere, must uphold their core ideology no matter what.  However, it is apparent that values are different across cultures, whether it's Asia or Europe.  What would be interesting is an empirical study to see how the author's framework and the surrounding ideas of visionary companies apply to other cultures.  For example, how would the structure for preserving the core ideology such as commitments to BHAGS, promoting from within, creating a cult-like culture and maximizing profits fair in other parts of the world?    Although the book's ideas and analysis revolves around the corporate world, it is interesting that it could be applied to an individual as it resonates on a personal level.  Core ideologies form the fundamental values for the company's sense of purpose or their reasons for existence.  Similarly, individuals have fundamental values and a sense of purpose for existence that works very much the same way as described in the framework of visionary companies.  As individuals, everyone have a set of core beliefs of what is right and what is wrong, and how one should act and behave in ways that are ideal.  For example, one may live by the guidelines of righteousness, charitable, and respect. The authors noted that visionary companies could sacrifice everything, even if it means losing money, which is the bloodline for their survival, if it means preserving the core values.  On an individual level, it means that one needs to find what is meaningful to them and commit to it completely.  This commitment will ultimately bring success.  Collins and Porras have cleared up an often vague and fuzzy concept of \\"vision.\\"  As the authors say, the idea of vision \\"conjures up all kinds of images\\" (219.)  Many often confuse a company's vision with its mission.  Although related, the two ideas are different.    The authors have put together a coherent framework of researched case studies that make for instructive reading by \\"pointing out telling trends\\" and giving readers \\"some delightful old dirt on the companies' early struggles\\" .  Moreover, unlike many academic books, which are more theory based, \\"Built to Last\\" is more practical.  It provides guidelines, like a handbook that teaches the principles of what it takes to be \\"visionary.\\"  The book has been in existence for 12 years and continues to sell by the truckload.  It is easy to see why.  Many books seem to have the answer until a few years go by and it no longer fits.  \\"Built to Last\\" is a classic and its principles are timeless.  As the authors indicated, many of today's management concepts have been built off these principles.  Often time, people forget the fundamentals.  This book brings people back to reality and keeps people in touch with the core foundation of success.  It inspires people because it give them hope and a vision that could guide them to be \\"Builtto Last.\\"
B0017HMF6W|5.0|My review for North by Northwest BR is 5 stars all around like most other reviewers so I will not go into details. My comment is for the audio level being way too low. The loudness setting on my Denon AV receiver is normally set at -17 DB, but for this movie I had to crank up the loudness to ZERO DB in order to hear properly. After the movie when I go to the extra features, the sound level comes on blasting and I had to scramble to lower the volume.  I will not take away any stars from my review and hope others will not get their ear drums blasted like I did. So remember to turn the volume back down immediately after the movie.
0451228375|5.0|Best book I've ever read.  Even better than Pillars of the Earth.  Thoroughly enjoyed it. Like Oprah, I was sorry it ended!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|This is the best google reader for android.  Please bring the pro version to the market for my Kindle Fire.  I had the pro version on my android phone and loved it!
0440244412|5.0|First Thoughts after finishing: \\"No, I want more of Mac and Barron's story. Please don't let this end!\\"<br /><br />I was browsing at the library a few weeks ago, noticed this book and realized that it was time to read it. I have been putting it off because I didn't want the story to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to this fantastic fae world that Moning created and these incredible characters that graced Dublin's streets. This was an epic book both in content and page length. I wondered how long it would take me to read. I shouldn't have worried one bit because as soon as I cracked the spine and settled in, the pages flew like lightning. I read this book in two days and couldn't wait to get back to it whenever I had to set it down. For me this is the what Urban Fantasy is all about- one big kick ass book after another. Few writers can take their readers to such great heights each and every book and continue to deliver each and every time. Moning has crafted a high caliber book which never lets the reader down. I loved all of the twists to the story, the surprises that I never saw coming and most of all the development of her characters. I happily lost myself in this world and didn't want to surface for air.<br /><br />Recommend? Most definitely...but please make sure that you read this series in order. You will miss out on clues and the building of the story and people if you don't start at the beginning!<br /><br />Dear Karen,<br />Please continue with this series. I can't stand the thought that I will never get to walk the streets of Dublin with Mac ever again. I need my dose of that crazy, sexy Jericho and I still think you have more to tell us!!!!!!!!!<br />Sincerely,<br />Staci
B00479SVBU|3.0|Like the title says the sound quality is nowhere near cd quality.  Most of my mp3's sound muddy compared to tracks I burned onto disc.  Everything else works fine.  A bit disappointed with sound quality is all.  I guess I'll just have to get my car stereo system changed so it can accept USB MP3.  Anyone know of a good but cheap one?
B004HO6I4W|4.0|We saw this at the theater, rented it and now just bought the Blu-Ray pack which is a superb value - you get not just the Blu-Ray disc, but also a DVD disc (great for the kids' portable DVD players) and a digital copy that you can download via a code to one device (e.g. a PC, Kindle or iPad).  The movie itself is fantastic - my wife is Brazilian and spoke highly of the realism of the Rio scenes, including the favelas/slums, and the male lead being voiced by a native Brazilian.  The humor is mostly for kids but some nice musical numbers too.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this trying so save a buck, worked fine for a few months but now it works intermittently, which is really embarrassing at work. Now I have to buy the Apple version so in the long run I did not save a dime... anyone want to buy my old 'Moshi' HDMI adapter on the cheap...
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Another watch that follows the trend of big watches, the 1512 has a casual and kind of an elegant look at the same time, which is great as I can use it for work (on a business casual dress code) or during the weekends when I normally wear jeans and more casual clothes.<br /><br />Same as the 1430 line, it does have a stop watch function and can also be used as a tachymeter.  The crowns to set it up are on the left side rather than the right, which is where they are normally located.  Included in the box is a set of instructions on how to use all features. The second hand is red while the hour and minute hands are white, which makes a good combination and adds to the look on the face of the clock.<br /><br />Contrary to what you may expect, it is not as heavy as it looks and the band is quite comfortable. Important to note that the band is fabric on the front side and leather on the back, I added a couple pictures as this is not that clear in the Amazon product description photos.<br /><br />As my other Invicta watches, it is precise and I have had no issues whatsoever. I am so excited with this new watch that I have been practically using it on a daily basis; from my watch collection, I have to say the Invictas are my favorites. They are well made, look great and trendy, and overall, perform as expected.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are into big watches.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is amazing!  I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and I was getting discouraged with his recent books.  I couldn't finish A Buick 8, or Lisey's story. I felt that The Dome ended abruptly and ruined the whole book.  I feared the days of a good solid story with likeable characters like The Stand and Insomnia were a thing of the past.  Then I read 11/22/63 and I am once again I'm hooked.  The story is classic King replete with the music his fans have come to love.  He also brings in a lot of references to the 50s & 60s which will make you nod your head and say \\"oh yea, I remember that\\".<br /><br />There was more sex and romance than I would have liked, but it wasn't lewd or graphic, it just seemed repetitive.  YES ALREADY we know that Jake is crazy for Sadie.  I felt like I was beat over the head with it...perhaps that was the point and I just missed it.  At any rate, the over-kill doesn't distract from the story, but it didn't add to it either.<br /><br />I just have to say thanks to Stephen King.  11/22/63 is over 800 pages, but it was a \\"quick\\" read that ended too soon.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele's full-length concert film Live at the Royal Albert Hall is stunning both musically and visually. It's Adele's very first home music video release and it will please everyone who loves Adele or just enjoys some of her songs. Her humor, vulnerability, toughness, candor, and raw musical talent are on display from start to finish. I'm a devotee since 21 was released last February, so I was hoping for a lot on this set and am thoroughly pleased.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Loved the cd.  First bought her newest cd Adele 21 and that was awesome.  She has a beautiful voice and such a unique style.  Very good music to chill to.
1569242739|4.0|I've had this book for over 5 yrs. and this book is filled with yummy cupcakes like the pumkin chocolate chip, Margarita and it's my go-to book for chocolate cupcakes. I'm no longer a Vegan but these are the best chocolate cupcakes around. My husband and kids LOVE these. This book is a must have for anyone who loves cupcakes. I would have given this 5 stars but the binding came apart really easily so you have to be careful with it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can show all the photos on my PC with my new Fire.  hope the interfaces can be even better but great product!
B005EHNEDO|5.0|Try to find better music than The Whole love in the past year. Impossible. This mix of ingenious music just keeps hitting you right between the eyes and the heart. I have listened to Wilco for the past 10 years with some respect and some indifference. They were never a \\"favorite\\" band but had a good solid sound. Jeff Tweedy and his group outdo themselves and dig deeper into their listeners than ever before with mood, sound and lyrics that will survive the group itself. The simple but staggering \\"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)\\" that wraps up the album is one of the simplest yet memorable pieces of music ever recorded. It gets in the head and soul and simply stays there. Hats off to Tweedy and Company. They have really produced a Masterpiece.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play and great fun.  Time seems to Just fly when you are playing.  Highly recommend to anyone especially if you travel and need to kill time. It's the best.

B003PBB4ME|1.0|I ordered this from Amazon and promptly returned it. Nothing ground-breaking to report that hasn't been stated from prior reviewers who remarked on the same exact issues, but I found the switched screw plates on the botton platform and on the top of the handle to be deal breakers, as well as the poor quality of the foam handle.<br /><br />The X-Grip is a knockoff of the Cam Caddie Scorpion product, but with the added feature of a screw mount on the top arm - great for a flash unit, microphone, etc. However, Opteka botched the screw-style and it cannot hold an accessory properly.<br /><br />In addition, this reviewer said it best: \\"This is a nice handle, but it still has the same manufacturer defect as mentioned by other reviewers: they installed the incorrect mount on bottom of unit (as well as the top). This mount does not contain a threaded nut, so you can NOT mount the unit on a tripod. And the nut is non-removable, so it can't be fixed. I have read where ALL current stock is incorrect and manufacturer is trying to replace. But currently, Amazon just keeps shipping defective stock.\\"<br /><br />Amazon has a habit of not properly vetting some of their third-party products when reviewers flag the items as defective. Some thing I hope they address in the near future to help retain brand integrity and trust.
0446573019|5.0|Outstanding, John Puller fulfills his obligation with the Military in a very professional manner.  How much of what we read today is fiction/truth.  For all we know there are hidden caches of weapons hidden in mountains just waiting to be found or exploded by the enemy.  I would highly recommend this book to all.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|As the title states, I \\"hate to be a hater\\" and I'm certainly a fan of Amazon in several ways, but this backpack is really a piece of junk. And, sadly, I have to tell you to stay away... I don't know what other 5-star reviewers have been drinking, but anyone who's ever used a backpack specifically tailored for photography will tell you that this backpack is not even worth $20. Why so harsh?<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Cheap (and that's it...really)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* VERY thin padding<br />* Poor stitching and workmanship<br />* Ugly zippers, which will \\"sweat\\" and get \\"greasy\\" in the long term<br />* Flimsy - poor internal structure means your gear will move around, a lot! Something you don't want to happen if you're looking for true protection<br />* Pack rides very high on your back and is uncomfortable<br />* chest strap is located too high up on the shoulder straps allowing it to \\"sit\\" on your neck. Not good.<br /><br />I would certainly return this, but unfortunately I got this backpack as part of a promotion when I purchased a new camera from Amazon, and will lose the promotion price. Thus, I will \\"gift it\\" this holiday season to my daughter to use with her every-expanding arsenal of personal electronics, since it should not be used with a DSLR that you actually want to protect.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I had my mind set on buying a PS Vita as my Christmas gift to satisfy my gaming on the go but after hearing its release was being pushed back to 2012 I decided to look for an alternative.  All my research lead to this thing of beauty.  After looking up reviews and watching a bunch of videos, the PS Vita took the back seat and the G155 was all I wanted.  I was fortunate enough to get it at a great price during the BF sale.  I'm not going to restate why this machine is so great because most reviewers already have.  I just want to show my support to GAEMS for making such an awesome device.  Don't hesistate to buy it, because you'll be asking yourself why you hadn't bought it sooner.
0307593312|5.0|Loved all Murakami's work I read before this came out and was excited to read it.  So I'm terribly biased.  Wanted to agree with other reviewer that it is not the Murakami to start with.
1451627289|5.0|I read roughly 1 book a week and it has been a very long time since I puchased one I couldn't put down.  This is the first and only Stephen King book I have ever read and it was definately a page turner.  After only two days I finished it and was surprised at how fun it was to read.  I have to say I am a sap and the story line between Jake and Sadie was the biggest reason I kept pushing forward, but you should definately buy this book.  Most readers will not be disappointed.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I just received this package, it's in great condition! Actually, it's in perfect condition! This series is really great and I recommend everyone who loves nature buy this one and keep it all through your lifetime!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is well made, addictive and very fun.  I played the crap out of this. Good job everybody involved.
B003L77G6A|4.0|We've bought each season of this wonderful and hilarious show. Only about a half dozen episodes into this, but so far no disappointments in the content. Writing is as good as always, though there seems to be more emphasis on relationships and less on the \\"geek\\" stuff. (Hopefully we fanboys and girls will be treated to more good stuff as in previous seasons, and less focus on the sex.)  As for the DVD, I don't know what it is but the video quality for this one just doesn't seem quite as good and crisp as previous releases. I've watched it on two different players, both \\"upconvert\\" models (including the one we used for the last season) and it just seems a bit less. Nothing glaring, just think it could have been crisper. Not sure if it's just this disc or all of them, but thought I'd mention it.  If you've never seen the show, however, I recommend starting with the first DVD; the characters will make more sense, and frankly, you'll want to get them all after that!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|perfect for kindle fire! now i can have access to my laptop everywhere.  i have compared it to the logmein apps which cost 30 dollars. this apps is perfect!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|lol ha ha this movie is epic and funny at the same time . i will never look at country folk the same again
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything works as stated in the description. I can't imagine why anyone would give this less then 5 stars. The feature set alone dwarfs the competition. And it all functions flawlessly.
1601252463|5.0|Pathfinder is what DnD 4th edition could have been and should have been. This long awaited expansion is a worthy add-on to the original rules. It expands the game in all aspects from new races and classes to new feats, spells and bling. Gary Gygax would be proud.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire.  It's a tiny bit sluggish, but very easy to set up and connect.    Excellent product!
159514188X|5.0|A little out of my age range some might say but i bought it on my kindle and i couldn't put it down well didn't want to had to when my girls needed me to! But I think its good for everyone to read a lot of people including adults don't think about the after effects of their actions... And being a mom just reminds me of how cruel people can be.. I haven't been out of high school long but seems like teens are only getting more and more cruel..
B003UAKE9Y|3.0|I'm a 30 year old woman and even to me, this movie is creepy!  It's good in that it teaches kids not to go off on their own and not to disobey parents.  However it teaches these lessons in such a morbid way.  The stop animation was good and it was creative.  It kind of reminds me of a Tim Burton movie.  Was this from Tim Burton?  I would rate this a 3.5/ 5 stars
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I got this app in conjuction with evernote, what a cute little app! It can be fun as well as useful. Ever wanted to draw something for visual people that don't understand your verbal explanation? This is the cure.
B00511PTWM|4.0|I needed something to power my Valentine One and Garmin GPS while driving my wife's vehicle. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It's a little big but to be honest I don't know how they could have made it any smaller. I like that it has the adjustment so that you can swivel it in any way.  I didn't have to make any adjustments to make the unit fit but there was one time where I lost power so I may need to mess around with it for a tighter fit.  I have another one of these dual chargers but it's designed with two separate plug in's and they have a tendency to flop around.   These types of plug in's make me realize how much I like having the V1 hardwired into my mirror. The less wires the better. I wouldn't want to use this everyday unless it was in a glove box.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|When a book and its' characters become what you think about throughout the day, even when you're not reading it - you know it is masterful writing.  I found myself wondering what some of the characters would do next, or if they should have done something differently.<br /><br />It definitely goes against many rules of novels in that there are surprises and shocking scenes where there normally shouldn't be.  But that is all part of George Martin's writing and what makes this series so dramatic.  You think the story would end when a certain character dies, but then later in the story you realize that the death set forth a series of actions that wouldn't have happened if they hadn't died.  I highly recommend this series - the characters are so rich and developed (you'll have your favourites and even some you HATE will be ones you love to hate).<br /><br />I am glad I only just stumbled upon these books recently....I can't imagine how painful it would have been to wait years in between each book!!  I was able to read 4 in a row without the time lapse in between - but now I wait for books 5 and 6 just like everyone else.<br /><br />Enjoy!!  Winter is Coming :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone I talked too about book recommended \\"The Hunger Games\\" and because of the new movie coming out next year I thought I would give it a try. I bought the first book in the trilogy on Wednesday night and couldn't put it down. By the weekend I had all of the books finished and couldn't believe how great this story was.  The story was very unique and interesting. The writing was great. Usually I am very picky about the books I read but I got hooked by Katniss Everdeen right away. The horrible things the Capitol does to this girl and Peeta, just makes me want to burn them all down.  I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story to read. Even though the ending is bitter sweet, SOOO bitter sweet, I am very happy about how it ended. I wish there was more of the story and can't wait for the new movie to come out in March. Even though I don't see the actors as the characters in the book I'm sure that will all change when I see the movie.  Peeta is such a good person I can't believe the hard life he has had. I am super sad for him, even though he is a fictional character.

This app is good for keeping track of how strong the signal is at various places within my own home and at other places around town where I can pick up WiFi signals.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|As an artist Adele performs with such humility and power. She does make you feel like you are setting in her living room, having a cup of tea and a take away. Her voice is so breathtaking. What power to move people the way she does. There will never be another like her.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I have a Rosen navigation system with an ipod kit in a 2010 Volkswagen CC. When the nav system was installed--although I now had an Ipod connector--I lost the ability to use the auxiliary connection in the car so I wasn't able to listen to Pandora on my Android system smartphone. I tried many alternatives to be able to listen to mp3s and/or Pandora from my phone through my car's speakers but nothing worked until I came across this adapter. I got it in the mail today and it works great! I plugged it into the car's ipod cable and plugged the other end into my phone, launched the Pandora app, and the sound came through my car's speakers. I highly recommend it.
0385534639|4.0|I finished this debut novel at 2 am. Instead of sleeping. When I had a flight leaving at 6 am. I could end the review right there, but I think it deserves a little more explanation.<br /><br />First line: \\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\" Talk about setting a mood! At first I thought \\"huh, interesting.\\" but felt no real investment. As I wandered through bits of the circus it became so immersive that by the end I thought this opening line completely brilliant. It grows on you, seeps into your soul and stays there. As a first line, it's enough of a hook to make you read on to the next page. As a synopsis of the whole story, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Mechanics: My biggest issue with this story is that it's in third person, present tense. I realize this is the fashion and fad these days for literary novels, but I hate it. It makes everything distant and cold. It makes me feel as though I'm looking through a glass window at the action. A dirty glass window. A dirty glass window with the words \\"wash me\\" written in the dirt. That said, I think parts of it simply had to be this way. There are two narratives going on here...one is meant to describe what you, the reader, are doing as you make your way through the circus. That has to be third person, present tense. The rest is the backstory of the circus itself. To me, that part would have been more intimate told in the normal past tense. I found my head twisting the present tense into past tense as I read which threw me out of the story. However, the story itself is fascinating. So gripping, in fact, that I pressed onward despite the mechanics. The tense is easy to forget when people are talking, and since there is more dialog in the second half of the story that might be why some think the story picks up then. It's not the story, it's the mechanics. No matter how much in fashion it is, it's simply not comfortable to read for any length of time for the average person. This is not a script...and shouldn't read like one. There, done ranting. Don't let this stop you from reading the book because truly the story more than makes up for my little pet peeve.<br /><br />Voice: I found the voice to be haunting and captivating. The sentence structure is simple and straightforward. It sucks you in much the way I imagine the circus would if you were to stumble upon it.<br /><br />Plot: This is a literary novel, not a thriller. It's not action packed, but it is STORY packed. By that I mean the entire story is like entering the circus it describes. You cautiously inch your way forward, discovering more and more as the story unfolds until you are up at 2 am trying to get to the end and hoping against hope that it can wrap up this enchanting tale in a way that won't leave you wanting. Well done, Ms. Morgenstern, well done.<br /><br />Characters: I have to admit, due to the glass lens of present tense, the characters all feel a bit distant. I'm not sure I cared so much about them as I did about the circus itself. I think this might even be exactly what the author intends. Even one of the main characters spends her time finding a way for the circus to sustain itself without her. The same could be said for the story. I found this fascinating. I don't think I've ever read a story before where I didn't really care about the characters at all and yet was so captivated to see it unfold. I'm still not sure what to make of that and how it was done. I suspect I'll be coming back to this story to read it again when I've let it sit. The real main character through the entire story is the circus. I have to admit, I'm in love with the circus and now have an intense longing to decorate in black and white.<br /><br />The Night Circus haunts me. I find myself thinking of it at odd times, like the reveurs in the story. Wishing the story ittells is a true story. Hoping it's real. Needing it to be real. If it grabs you like it did me, then perhaps you'll join me. Put on a black coat and a red scarf and come on out. I'll be wandering around outside the city in the evenings, looking for the circus.al. If it grabs you like it did me, then perhaps you'll join me. Put on a black coat and a red scarf and come on out. I'll be wandering around outside the city in the evenings, looking for the circus.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This product is exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Yes, the snap in portion is plastic but it's encased in rubber.  The top flap fits perfectly over the screen.. could maybe be like 1mm too short if EVEN that... The elastic band holds the flap shut and is good for holding to read so it doesn't fall out of your hands.  The stand isn't sturdy but it's not flimsy either, so it gets the job done.  Overall for $29, I'm happy with the product.  There are other covers out there but they don't have a stand or they're over $40.. and I personally like a rubber cover over a leather one.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Rihanna - Talk That Talk Review  RiRi dropped a new album! She can Talk That Talk to me all night long. This album is delicious. I just can't deny, Rihanna's new trance/house/electronica/dubstep influence really ads a lot to this already sexi artist. I will review the most heavily techno influenced tracks - I don't dislike the others, but they don't interest me as much. The strongest tracks on the album have the strongest trance elements. I'm so glad the transistor and moog synthesizers were invented so that RiRi can \\"Do Ya Thang.\\"  This club-ready album and has me all hot and finding love in hopeless places, it's so enticing. I can't wait for the remixes to start flowing and the naughty times that will be had listening to this album.  Where Have You Been  \\"Where have you been all my li-i-i-i-i-fe?\\" Rihanna has finally found a new boo that treats her well. And it's trance. This track has a great hook and back beat and grows in excitement like a good trance song should.  The way she repeats words which melt/reverb into melody is wonderful.  We Found Love  So many people have been finding love in this track it reached Bilboard #1 status as it should! This complete dance track does everything it should, the energy it provides is obvious. It rises and falls to give you a chance to rest, but still seems to always be on an upward swing. The rising bass adds so much wonderful excitement and when the crescendo finally bursts, the song keeps flowing. Rihanna's voice belts out the melody but is simultaneously airy. The back beat is quite punchy and melodic beating out the arpeggiated melody. Something about this track just makes it so repeatable and turn it up LOUD-able! This song is easily played #onrepeat for hours helping you find love while you are hopelessly writing papers and dancing in your chair; it never gets old.   We Found Love Music Video   In a smoky haze of desperation and love, RiRi and her cute boi capture the essence of the track - high strung, quick scenes cutting to them having tons of fun tearin up the night, making out and partying wherever they please. Maybe it's the drugs (it is). The video flashes pills and the contracting iris of her eye and shows a multi/rainbow colored joint emphasizing the trancy qualities that allow you to get lost in this song for hours - they are clearly lost in each other and the night. Perhaps this is a nod to the Goa Psychedelic Trance influence. Sadly though there are still overtones of abuse and gender violence - her boyfriend jerks her head by the chin, flashes of red and blue light seem to hint at police presence, he tattoos MINE on her ass, which he feels he owns. And when the trip on high is over, she can see how trashy and hopeless the situation really is and cries in a corner. The video seems to express that even though this album is all about being hopelessly madly in love with her new love and sex, she still hasn't fully gotten over the domestic abuse from Chris Brown. But there are some stunning visuals for the video bar!  Talk That Talk  This title track featuring Jay-Z uses an interesting distortion or synthed electric organ for the melody. The chorus is alright, but I feel that Jay-Z's cameo is rather jarring, overpowering, and kind of extraneous to the song overall. Not the best track on the album, but the \\"talk that talk\\" line is ok. I think that part should be extracted in remixes, but the rest of the song should be ignored.  Cockiness (Love It)  The rhythm on this track is most obvious with a very deep and slower back beat as well as a guy's hollow shouting provide an interesting space for Rihanna to offer one of her most sexually explicit songs: \\"Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion.\\" At unnatural speed she says \\"I love it I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it. Iloveitiloveitiloveit.\\" This line has been clearly remixed. The part where the guy draws out \\"Youuuuuuu\\" is pretty awkward. Like \\"Talk That Talk,\\" the song is not that interesting except for thelyical innuendo. It would be better to stripped out the cool lines and remix them into something else.   Birthday Cake  The faded/flanged/phased/distorted/synth sliding all over the place and Rihanna's hum immediately seduce you and bring you into the track. An alarm goes off and the clap track starts as she tells you \\"come and put your name on it\\" with lots of repetition. Another instant club track. She's right I totally wanna lick the icing off. The erotics of this track are as strong as the synth and claps. I really do \\"want it in the worst way,\\" \\"and it's not even my birthday.\\" I totally want to eat all the cakecakecakecakecakecake, the full cake, not just the 1:18 tease that she gave us. \\"So enticing.\\"  The way they fade out the song in the middle of a clearly strong lyrical section seems to hint that the full song exists and will be released later. This was just meant to be a tease. Fans were already asking for the full version before the album was officially released and the producer tweeted that they are working on it. My belief is that they already made the full version and simply want to release it as a digital download to make extra money on top of the album sales and to create extra buzz around the track which is the most explicit on the album, and is probably not fit for radio play. But alllll the gays still want to lick the icing off in the worst way.   Drunk of Love   This song opens with a pinging melody firmly placing this song as another solid electronica track. This song has a sadder mood than the others and matches the synthed background to her belting cry of being \\"drunk on love\\" reverb the way it needs to, almost like a siren. A bit slower than the other tracks but again a very strong chorus begging to be remixed.   Roc Me Out  Another track with a cool phased/flanging filling sound vibrating a deep melodic sound. The lyrics are decently sexual. The track is a bit slower and doesn't have those super high points that the other songs reach. Still decent though. Again begging to be remixed.  Red Lipstick (deluxe track)  Very cool dubstepped bass and melody, vibrating in and out, up and down. The lyrics sound dirty and dark but are hard to understand beyond the chorus. The song is slower and not that exciting overall but sounds cool as an abstract piece if you don't pay too close attention to the lyrics and just take in the dark vibe the song is sending out.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Many people are bashing this movie because of the ultraviolet copy but they are just being unduly negative.  The fact is the important version (the blu ray) is fine and the movie itself is pretty good (not as good as Captain America or some of the others but not bad).  In addition to the blu ray you get a dvd, a code for Batman Arkham City (to play as Bat-Sinestro) and the bonus copy for your computer.  Yes the ultraviolet service sucks but all it takes is filling out a quick form on flixter [...] and they will replace it with an itunes code.  Also those whining about the ultraviolet don't mention that it not only comes with this film but the excellent \\"Emerald Knights\\" animated feature as well.  As I write this I don't know if I will get the ITunes code for Emerald Knights as well but still. . . people need to get over it.
B005HIBWFW|4.0|After literally decades of waiting, it is a joy to at last have this remarkable and grievously neglected masterwork available on DVD. The good news is that it's a clean and complete print with fine image and sound. The crying shame is how cavalierly it has been packaged. The manufacturers simply took no pains whatever. Inconceivably, there is no discrete chaptering. One starts the movie playing and is able to advance or reverse through it at 10 minute intervals. That is all. Well, aside from having the original theatrical trailer included which, under the circumstances, feels like a bone thrown to a dog. Looking past this unforgivable disregard for the work, however, it remains one of the great masterpieces of the early 1970s. It is a must-have for any serious film buff.<br /><br />It's especially important to cut through the totally false reputation with which it was saddled by vicious critics at the time of its release. First among these was Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who accused it of being a fantasy that completely falsified Tchaikovsky's life. One can only marvel at the arrogance of someone so respected making a charge which is so mind-bogglingly false. Any look at the facts reveals that Russell and his co-writer Melvyn Bragg stick closely to recorded history, only dovetailing certain events and combining certain characters to achieve well-paced dramatic action. They add absolutely nothing to the narrative which isn't either a direct event from the composer's life or which combines aspects of characters or personality traits into bundles that most powerfully communicate the underlying truths surrounding his tempestuous life.<br /><br />Among its prime virtues are its incandescent performances. Richard Chamberlain captures the gentility of his character while masterfully navigating its frequent hysteria, along with giving one of the most credible on-screen representations of piano virtuosity. Glenda Jackson, alternately ingratiating, steely, pathetic, and finally insane, is a tower of creative fire. They're beautifully supported by Christopher Gable's wonderfully effeminate Russian count, Kenneth Colley's scheming brother, Max Adrian's pompous impresario, Izabella Telezynska's cunning benefactress, and Maureen Pryor's venal matriarch.<br /><br />Best of all, though, is Russell's almost preternatural feel for the music itself, every note of it by Tchaikovsky. From the opening, a little-known scherzo whose jarring shift from major to minor underlines the film's title, to the notorious 1812 Overture sequence where the lead characters are decapitated by canon fire, we are treated to a marriage of sight and sound unequalled in all cinema. No film before or since has ever approached the brilliance of Russell's musical visualizations, the standout being the first Piano Concerto's second movement, given in full and tying together all the film's conceptual and emotional threads in perfect synchronization with Tchaikovsky's music.<br /><br />Perhaps one day the DVD makers will deign to give this wonderful film the respect it is due. But for now, the fine print alone is more than worth the price.is a tower of creative fire.

B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Crow was a wonderful story both in comic print and transfered well onto screen. One of my favorite movies of all time (own VHS, Sp Ed DVD) & now BluRay.  i am truly happy with my purchase (included digital copy) and very pleased with both price of movie and speed of delivery.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The last music recorded by the Beatles, this album is second only to Revolver in showcasing the range of talents exhibited by the group.  I won't say much since you can find nearly-endless material to read about this and all things Beatles.  You will never regret purchasing this album, no matter what format.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This beats the heck out of hooking up via USB for every little file transfer!  This is WELL worth a buck!!!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Some people have said this movie is scary including my mom who really wanted to see it. If thats how you think so be it but dont stop other people from seeing it. Im a big fan of Christmas movies and have never found it scary. I just wish Id known it was a Christmas movie when it was in the theater although in hindsight which is twenty twenty the word polar should have been a clue. What these people call scary I call thrilling and entertaining.To each his own I guess unfortunally. A little kid is unsure of the existance of Santa Claus so a train takes him to the north pole on Christmas eve. Thats all it is. The fact that it had a little action in it is just coincidental.That was probably done to keep viewers interested and all of you people who said it was to scary have obviously either missed the point of the movie or not bothered to watch it long enough. Or worse yet both. The conduter is trying to get the boy to believe.In Santa Claus. God. Something. Anything that you dont have to ask questions about. Isnt that what Christmas is suppose to be all about? Merry Christmas.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|**A Few Spoilers**  I have to admit I really disliked this book at first.  Twice I set it down with the intention of moving onto another book.  What kept me going?  Curiousity more than anything kept me trudging along.  I wondered why they kept jumping from character to character and where was the link.  I recall the same feeling when I read Let the Great World Spin, but in that book I was engaged with the characters and it kept me going.  It's difficult to say what page it was since I was reading this on a Kindle, but around 26% through I started to appreciate the connections and wanted to keep reading.  I liked most of the characters and how everyone is intertwined in one another's life.  I don't know if there is a word for it, but I would call it a sort of \\"life nepotism\\".    I loved having different perspectives, although most of the guys perspectives seemed a little softer than I would picture in real life.  Once had completed the book I felt it would have been ruined with exaggerated links to the previous character or how their lives intertwined.  Much of life is nuance and you have to do the best you can and pick up on those dirty details yourself.    I loved the diagram chapter.  Very innovative and easy to follow, despite the complexities of the circumstances.  Congrats to the author of insight into an autistic child's mind.  What I would have liked...  I wish at the end there was a diagram that showed the links between each character, a sort of extended family tree.  I know I am going to give this book a second read, which I rarely do on 4 star books, but I feel like I'd like to go back and really appreciate the depth of the complex relationships portrayed.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Graphics are adequate. Challenging yet fun. Game adds elements at a good pace. Difficulty is increased at great pace. Price at $.99 is reasonable.
0446573019|5.0|I really liked this book. I think that readers, like me, who enjoy the characters and action in the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child will enjoy Zero Day by David Baldacci, and vice versa, because the two men and the two plots are very similar. Both John Puller in Zero Day and Jack Reacher in the Reacher series come from a military family, are military cops who are very tall and strong, very knowledgeable about both military and practical matters, very tenacious, very ethically minded, independent, highly respected by high-level military personnel, have one brother who was in the military, and generally work alone on complicated cases. Even their names are similar: Jack and John, Reacher and Puller; one reaches and the other pulls, and both know what they want and get it, quickly and completely. And both prefer that people call them by their surname. Reacher, of course, has now left the military because he handled a case in an ethical manner. Puller faces the same problem in this book.<br /><br /> Puller's superior officer gives him an assignment that he says is very sensitive and that very high government officials are watching. But, strangely, he tells Puller that he must handle it all by himself. A Lieutenant Colonel, his wife and two kids are killed in a small West Virginia coal town. He tells Puller to find out who did it and why. But Puller is unable to understand why, if this case is so sensitive and the highest levels are following it, he must handle it alone. And why is he, a highly decorated and competent soldier, assigned a run of the mill murder case? And aren't the local cops able to handle it? Is he being set up? Unlike Reacher who travels with only a tooth brush, Puller packs his car with everything, from a machine gun and other weapons to bio-hazard suits. He soon discovers four more deaths, then others. The novel begins strong and continues strong throughout. The characters are finely drawn. It is unusually suspenseful and good.
1559408855|3.0|Call me a narcissistic cyber-doofus if you will (and I couldnt say I'd blame you) but this film, although obviously shocking and upsetting in narrative content, didn't evoke half as good a reaction as it could have had the acting been better.  I went through a pretty morbid obsession with watching all the reknowned emotion-crushing 'nasties', feeling that I should subject myself to such horrors simply because they existed, so should therefore be experienced. By the time I'd got through Requiem For a Dream and In a Glass Cage and (shudder) Irreversible, I was pretty much dead inside by the time I got to Salo lmao, so maybe my judgement is a bit distorted.  It is in many aspects a brilliant film, and a message can be derived about the abuse of power being carried out by governments and the horrors of political corruption. In my eyes, the four 'men of power' were The Man and the 'kids' were The Citezens and Everyday People that they were (metaphorically in this context, literally in the movie) raping. Then the grannies and the piano player and that are the ones in the middle who just commit nasty stuff simply to do as theyre told. This analogy can be applied to all kinds of monstrosities that have taken place throughout our collective history.  However, and I know I sound like I should be institutionalized or at least made to do some community service for saying this,but the acting wasn;t convincing at all, very hammish, and when the victims were acting out pain and agony it was like 87% of the time pretty tame. I felt this detracted from the film, but even typing that I feel ashamed to be called a human being lol.   But to give due credit, some of the bits involving defecation nearly made me do a sick...but that might've been the absynthe.  Anyway, don't be phased by the vulgar content...I wouldnt call this an exploitation film...tears can be cried and lessons can be learned.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used this on my new gaming rig, I went with a corsair liquid cooler for cpu cooling.  I don't have any numbers for you to compare but from what I read in the reviews this seems like the compound all the cool people use.  Shipped fast on free shipping was 2-3 days early but I was never able to track the package and it didn't come with any documentation or directions... but I personaly wasn't worried about that because I'm one of those cool people.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Well, I will begin this interview by saying, 'whats NOT to say about this charming, coming of age tale of wonder, wizadry, and groovy groovy times!' Lol.  I'll begin by commenting about the cover...you are drawn into the movie from the get go when you see this cover, like all good covers should do to you.  what do we see? we see three trainee-wizards, each with a magic wand and one a girl called hermione, running through a wood. Harry Potter, the main character,wears something of a fearful expression on his handsome, slightly nerdy features, his eyes sleepy behind his infamous lenses. Ronald takes up the rear, also looking doubtful, as they sprint towards their destination. But little hermione,striding calmly at H.Potter's shoulder...there is a glint in her eye. The wand is like a sparkler in her gloved hand and her eyes are bright with purpose.  And it is this sparkle, this explosion of destiny behind those dark, calm eyes, that is more or less the key to not just this Harry Potter movie, but every HP movie and indeed the whole philosophy and ethic of the shimmery, effervescent Rowling-conceived Universe.  And now for the movie itself...well, its good. 'Harry Potter 2' good. Not since I first saw the little goblin guy Dobby that theyre friends with with the funny voice (Dobby) has my faith in this wonderful wonderful franchise felt so strong, to see this beautifully misunderstood creature return in such a moving way.  Although Harry Potter is my favourite fictional character of all time, I shall stick my two hands up at this stage in the interview and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Harry Potter stories:I've never read the books...(it's my firm decision to never read any books that have been adapted into films; they spoil the films because they're always way better (read 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley for a fruitful example of this)) so naturally Im not a massive admirer of the movie adaptations, but this was hands down my favourite of the 7.  Having watched thePotter franchise develop from when I was a kid to now, I feel like I have grown up with my three good friends, Harry, Ronald Weasley and Hermione...  And growing up never felt so damn good.

B005NKIQ26|5.0|Now my five friends would be(iber) the first to tell you how quick I was jumping on the Beiber hatewagon. Hell, wouldnt be suprised if you saw me behind the wheel of the thing,. But I've changed my mind about him now because of his Xmas album just relased, Will you kiss me under the mistletoe  Yes I'll admit I had a hard time understanding where exactly Justin Beiber was coming from or what his goals in life were...but this recording is honestly one of the most heartfelt albums Ive heard of for a while which kind of shocked me. I mean its Beiber for gods sake! But the way he's taken crimbo traditionals and breathed fresh and contemporary life into them is genuinely pretty impressive. The duet with Jim Carrey surpasses her original song, Mistletoe is the best though because you really do feel like you could be cheek to cheek under the mistletoe with gorgeous Justin himself!Justin has restored my faith in the festive season. Im a Belieber!  A must for anyone with a human heart, Xmas or otherwise
B004132HZS|5.0|From beginning to the end this amazing DVD series will have you captivated. You need to watch each episode at least twice in order to fully grasped what you have just watched. I can't wait until the new episodes come out
B002ZG980U|3.0|...within a review within a review, and, by the implications put forward by the yarnsmiths of this wonderful(ly flawed)feature-length,so on and so on and so on times forever, deeper and deeper ad infinitum.  There's a lot that can be said about a film like this...and indeed, a lot has been said. Global praise has been peppered upon all involved with this sci-fi headache, some calling it the Citizen Kane of the dream-within-a-dream genre. (albeit a market that is wide open ATM).  But I, for one, am not with the majority of the planet on this one. When I first heard on Radio1 of the Conception of Inception and that it was close to Completion, I was hella excited. I've always been a fan of dreams, or 'Cranial Intertainments' as I fondly call them. They're funny, scary and unpredictable, whats not to love? Go dreams. So this film sounded very intriguing to me.  But unfortunately the magic and surreality, beauty, horror and broken reality and ugliness of dreams was in no way portrayed accurately in this film, Inception.  Do me one little favour. When you go to bed tonight, close your eyes. Fall asleep. Then wake up in the AM and tell me what you witnessed during your unconcious hours. Anything like the 'dreams' that occur in the movie Inception? No, obv!  I'm presuming people will think I'm focusing on the wrong aspects of this film,but I just think this is way too Hollywoody an approach for such a crimson idea. They should've given it to Polanski. At least then we could have had pretty, French-looking women to enjoy looking at.  Also, I found the part where they're falling off a bridge in a van into a river and the one guy ties them all up and floats about a hotel achingly dull and needlessly prolonged. Even the special effects of the buildings when they go all weird and stuff...it just failed to arouse me in any way at all!  Basically, love the onion-ethic (reality being like layers of an infinite onion, you peel away layer after layer) of this motion picture, and I generally like the ideas a lot, but think this film is a miscarraige of imagination.  And if anyone was wondering about the end of this film...the spinning top never stops.

B002QNGKGW|5.0|At the beginning of every show Dexter slaps a mosquito.  He seems to be lying face down.  Therefore he has to reach over his own back to slap his own arm.  I wonder--can anybody else do this?  Because I can't.  Maybe Dexter's body is made different from everyone else's.  Unless I just don't understand what's physically going on here.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ever since I bought Jillian's 6 week 6 pack abs DVD I've been addicted to her videos.  Before that I would mostly work out on my elliptical machine, but I needed to change it up a bit.  I saw this online and had to try it out.  I'd say I'm past beginner level as I've been working out for the past six months seven days a week trying to lose weight.  So far I have shed 37 pounds thanks to Jillian's help. I highly recommend this DVD. She combines strength training and cardio in all the work outs which I love.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Like everyone else on here, I got mislead into believeing that the digital copy can be downloaded then added to iTunes.  I went to the \\"Help\\" section of Flixster and also the \\"Help\\" at UltraViolet and read that you have to have the latest iTunes software installed and you must \\"Activate\\" your subscription within 3 days to be able to get the digital copy.  I did just that and nothing.  I then tried dragging the file onto iTunes like I normally would do with a real digital copy but nothing happened again.  When I try to play the file with QuickTime player, I get the following error message:<br />\\"Error -2041: an invalid sample description was found in the movie (ADS_UV_GreenLantern_live_main_FAXS_2000k_dl.mp4).<br /><br />BTW, the files were downloaded to the following path on my hard drive:  C:/ Documents and settings/ (your pc name here)/ My documents/ My videos.<br /><br />I checked the \\"Download\\" tab in Flixster to see if it downloaded but to my amazement, it was still downloading.  I waited until it finished which took forever to complete.  I thought maybe that was the reason why it didn't play or transfer to iTunes but when it finally finished it still did not work.  I then rebooted my laptop to see if maybe that would help but it did nothing as well.<br /><br />So, I signed up and downloaded 2 services to my laptop (flixster & UltraViolet), waited about an hour for the download to complete, uploaded the movie to my Flixster Collection, rebooted, dragged and dropped the file to iTunes and after all of that nothing happened at all.

B005D5EYHW|5.0|I purchased this book months ago at the regular price because I wanted to read it so badly ... needless to say I never got around to it.  As I was strolling through the library last week I saw the audio book and thought \\"brilliant\\".  I am SO glad that I didn't read the book because the audio book is amazing.  Tina Fey is both the author and the narrator which makes it even more hilarious ... they are her own stories!!  I borrowed this originally but it's so good that I'm considering purchasing my own copy!  I recommend over and over again!!
B0062DU5UY|5.0|I had the privilege of editing this book for publication and I thoroughly enjoyed it and have already purchased it and reread it! It was a great read and very interesting! Easily the next Harry Potter-esque book!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, levels are super creative. Just difficult enough to keep you hooked. One gripe is apple version has so many more levels! Show android some love zeptolab.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|This Blu-ray edition was obviously converted and remastered to high definition with the utmost care. It is simply beautiful to watch, with wonderful sound. A truly wonderful movie, with the always fun to watch Dick Van Dyke at his best.
B0068TJLSY|2.0|It's like an odd mashup of Jurassic Park, Stand By Me, District 9... And many other movies I've seen before. I'm really surprised because I typically like the people involved. At least I didn't pay to see this in the theaters! That's why I love cheap rentals on Amazon!
B005RAO0GS|3.0|Once again, a stunning & beautifully haunting album from Florence & the machine. Side note: if you haven't watched the episode of 'live at abbey road\\" with her performance, it's a must see for any fan.<br /><br />Update: after listening to for a while, this album is no where near as timeless as [[ASIN:B002F6FQGK Lungs]]. I became bored with the album quite quickly, where as I can still listen to her debut album & enjoy it as much as I did the first time.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|What a pleasant discovery of a movie! I love the premise, the execution, the comedy and the actors nailed it! Especially when the tin of coke gets knocked over...<br />I rented this because it was .99 and I definitely would pay to see this again! Probably going to buy the blu.<br />You've never seen Jennifer Aniston so raunchy and Charlie Day is my kind of guy!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Very nice app.  It gives me the opportunity to listen to World-Wide music and talk radio, while at the same time I can be reading a book, or playing Angry Birds, on my Kindel Fire.  The .99 cent version of this app allows you to create a list of your favorite stations. I like this app a-lot!!!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Paul is a great movie but it is not for kids.  If you like science fiction, this movie puts a new twist on it.  Paul is a rude but very smart alien not to metion a smart *ss.  The story line is great and the movie is hillarious and the way it portays our government is as true as can be.  Beware it has alot of profanity but it's still a great show enjoy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Both entertaining and challenging. I've never really cared for puzzles much, but this game is quite enjoyable to play. There were so many 5-star ratings I had to try it, and I'm glad I did. Entirely different---but equally as enjoyable as Angry Birds.
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|This Movie in my View is a B flick.  They might have put a lot of money into CGI to make it work but the plot really didn't work all that well.  If you see a ton of movies this might be a good one to see once but be smart and rent it and not buy the movie.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Robert
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Finally, the entire saga in one set!  The Blu-rays come in a very nice book that turns page by page each chapter of the epic Star Wars saga.  I was very happy with this set and the price was just right at $90.

B004EPZ07U|3.0|the movie is not the best but it's fun to watch with the family. i give it 3 1/2 stars. what i dont like is the fact i bought this so that i can have the digital copy and put it onto my iTunes....cant do it because its this horrible Ultraviolet/flixter digital copy version that you can only watch from one of their downloaded apps and adobe file and all this extra stuff you have to do just to watch it. i will never buy another bluray combo pack that has a ultraviolet/flixter digital copy item.

B005OCFHHK|4.0|The reviews warning against this product due to a lack of special features are completely misguided. The title of this release is \\"The 8 Film Collection\\"; it is not called \\"Collector's Edition\\" or \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or \\"The Bonus Features Galore Collection\\". This is a nice little set for casual fans who simply want all 8 films on blu-ray. And considering this set is (currently) less than $80, how can you complain?  Yes, if you're a huge fan of the franchise and want extended cuts and bonus features, save your time and money and wait for a possible future release. But I find it silly that so many reviewers are \\"warning\\" others not to buy this release because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles.  You know what it does have? The films.
0307913090|5.0|One reviewer of this book demoaned the paucity of reviews of the audiobook version.  Roy Dotrice, the narrator, initially sounded as though he would be difficult to appreciate but I quickly cast aside this misconception.  He is absolutely splendid in this role and provides such a convincing diversity of character voices that I continue to be amazed at each new one, however transient that character's appearance.  He engages the listener in a variety of subtle ways, with masterful pacing and tone.  I feel it would be redundant of many of the other reviewers to explore Mr. Martin's writing, but I will hazard a few comments.  I am new to his work except for his short story in Jack Vance's Dying Earth collection (which he also edits) but that was sufficient to get me started with his magnus opus.  The character development is complex and carefully considered, especially appreciated with my professional background (doctoral level clinical psychologist).  He develops many intersecting plot lines and works nicely between them.  The setting is engrossing and the realism of the scenes readily facilitates a \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" (which I think is attributed to Shakespeare), ranging from intense battle scenes, interpersonal conflicts, and sweeping drama.  Luckily, I'm only halfway through with the first audiobook and have mamy hours of entertainment ahead.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I saw it 3 times in the theater and twice since it was released on DVD! I'll say this right off to get it out of the way: BEST TRAIN WRECK EVER!  That scene was absolutely amazing! Ok, all gushing aside...This movie has all the classic earmarks you associate with Spielburg.  The movie is set in the late seventies...The era I grew up in...The Jaws age, the E.T. age.  Like those other classic films this captures that \\"feel\\" perfectly.  Its like E.T. and Stand By Me all wrapped up into a brand new movie.  A great story combined with the perfect atmosphere/setting, a terrific cast to make it all believable...even the cheesy parts that were cheesy on purpose!  I loved it all...The Train scene alone makes it worth seeing! Genious!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm a huge King fan; I love the fact that you always know you're reading a King book when you're reading a King book. That said, I was hesitant about getting 11/22/63 when I first read its synopsis. No particular reason, it just didn't grab my attention. But then I bought the book, and started reading the book, and I was hooked from the get-go. The novel reads like a short story idea about time travel with many hundreds of historical fiction pages thrown into the middle, but it totally works. My interest, even when I thought it was about to, never lagged. This is some of King's tightest writing. Normally, when I finish a book, I immediately start reading another one. But after I finished 11/22/63, I held off starting a new book because I wanted to hold onto the feeling I was left with. A great all-around read.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Where to begin? Admittedly, this soundtrack is intricately composed - beyond my limited musical understanding; however, I like to think that I possess a keen ear for quality music and a passionate appreciation for film, so that will have to suffice in my recommendation of this album.<br /><br />The well-established French electronic music duo known as Daft Punk has captured the hearts and ears of electronic music enthusiasts since the early 90s. As the main composers of the Tron Legacy soundtrack, the duo set aside a couple years of their career to concentrate on mastering this album, which features a 100-piece orchestra from London. With that being said, it was a no brainer for me to take an hour out of my day to pleasure my ears with this brilliant musical score. The soundtrack certainly goes against Daft Punk's traditional style of composition, fleeing from their typical house music feel to a more theatrical, synth-heavy approach accompanied by the talented orchestra.<br /><br />My personal experience with Tron: Legacy began about a month before the highly anticipated film hit theaters when I stumbled across a \\"leak\\" of the soundtrack online. With Daft Punk as the featured composer of the soundtrack, I knew I could not go wrong with giving it a listen. Right off the bat, the classical music approach is presented by \\"Overture\\" and then \\"The Grid,\\" both of which sooth the listener over with epically long build-ups. In \\"The Grid,\\" one of the only tracks on the albums that has vocals, Daft Punk uses a powerful quote by Flynn (\\"And then, one day...I got in\\") to maintain its slow and deliberate introduction of the plot. After the two introductory songs end, Daft Punk hits you with a trippy, fast-paced motorcycle ride through the city with Flynn's son, the protagonist of the film, with the song that is conveniently called \\"The Son of Flynn.\\" In theaters, this was the first scene where the audience really experienced the full effect of the 3D experience so it really got my adrenaline pumping. The beginning of the song is probably my favorite beat of the entire soundtrack.<br /><br />After a few tracks into the album, I began to notice how well Daft Punk managed to transition from song to song. From gradual to being caught off guard by abrupt endings, the album flows smoothly and always delivers a theatrical feel, no matter speed at which it makes your head bob. The pauses between tracks really enhance the mood of the soundtrack, really sending you on an up and down roller coaster ride of emotion as the tension gradually builds. We finally reach the climax of the film during \\"Flynn Lives,\\" which is unbelievably well-composed.<br /><br />\\"TRON Legacy\\" was a typical song to be playing during the credits scene at the end. As someone who places high importance on having a quality finale song, I was not impressed; I did not even really enjoy the tune. With that being said, this was the main flaw I could pick out with the soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, I thought Daft Punk did a brilliant job composing an original score that ultimately enhanced my complete experience with Tron Legacy. I would strongly recommend listening to the album before watching the film; doing so will give you time to enjoy a masterful technosonic adventure unfold through your headphones before you are able to match the exciting visual experience with the sounds. You know how people always say, \\"the book was sooo much better than the movie?\\" I guess that is what I am trying to say about this soundtrack in comparison to the film. I say check it out for sure.g. The beginning of the song is probably my favorite beat of the entire soundtrack.

B005J4TLO8|5.0|Funniest movie I've seen in a long time!  It is a little crude at times, similar to a Harold and Kumar movie.  It's very witty and suspenseful. I saw this with my husband at the theater and we both loved it!
B004WR125O|1.0|I purchased the UWF-1 to use wireless feature of the ONKYO-TX-NR509.  After several hours of troubleshooting and configuration I was not able to get this adapter to work with my home wireless network.  Here are the basic steps I performed (note: I did not have the receiver connected to a TV and used LCD user interface)  1. upgrade the receiver firmware to the latest available from ONKYO-USA (That went pretty well - used USB pen drive).  2. Press Standby after firmware upgrade and connected the adapter. Turned on the receiver  3. After USB initialization, I tried the 3 methods offered by the receiver to configure the wireless.  a) Manual set-up : this ONLY works if your SSID is broadcast). Otherwise NO way of entering an SSID.  So, after changing the ssid setting on my router, the receiver detected it.   Then entered WPA2-psk(AES) key.  After this the receiver connected successfully.  However, after I power cycled the receiver, the adapter would no longer connect. Signal level (which typically was 75%) the first time, would remain at 0. I left the receiver all night in that state and in the morning, it was still trying to connect and signal level was still 0.  b) If your router is WPS capable, you can use 2 other options: Push button or PIN.  I tried both and they failed to connect the receiver to my wireless network. I have used these same feature with other devices connected to my network and it is working fine.  After this I decided to return the adapter. My main usage for wireless was so that I could stream internet AUDIO content directly to the receiver. I can workaround this by using the direct iPOD/iPhone and iPAD connection capability of the ND509. Having my iPAD do the wireless connection instead of the receiver.  Another reviewer mentioned an alternative adapter to the UWF-1. I have ordered one and will try this as well although ONKYO states that no other adapter will work.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|I just wanted to step up to the plate and offer my $0.02 on this particular release of this album. First, I've never owned any other versions of this album... not the original LP, or the initial CD of this release, or any other remastered versions, etc- other than this CD/DVD/DVD-A (DVD-Audio) version. And I know that a good handful of folks here have made it clear that this particular release is basically crap (to them)... and they're entitled to their opinion. We'll, here's my take on it.  Basically, I think this is a great album, and it is essential Graham Nash to me... it has some really great songs, many thought-provoking lyrics, some great supporting artists, etc. It all works for me- and I think it's a superb solo release from beginning to end. I really wish I tuned into this music when it first came out- it's the same way I feel about David Crosby's title 'If I Could Only Remember My Name'. To me, both of these albums are newly-discovered hidden treasures (for me anyway)... can't believe I missed out on these great pieces all of these years.  Now, as far as this particular 'release' of this title is concerned (i.e. with the DVD-A(udio) content)- I have to say I have no issues with it sonically whatsoever. My only gripe (and this is the *only* complaint I have about this release)- is that I wish they would've released this in the full 96/24 resolution, and not the 48/24 res this title features. I personally think it sounds damn good for a 48/24 title though... real clean in fact (and DVD-A is lossless of course). If there's clipping, etc I sure can't tell with the surround rig I've currently got (a rig with 370W of power to each of the mains which are also stereo bi-amped, 120W of power to the center/surrounds, high-end cables throughout, and I typically listen to all of my music titles at no more than '2' on the volume knob- which is more than loud enough to fill our entire living room with great sound, and not have any issues with distortion). The point here is not about my rig (I'm sure there are many better)... it's that I take my music and movie reproduction seriously, and I've tried hard to piece together various components that help me do exactly that. If there are issues with the 'sonics' on this Graham Nash title (at least on the DVD-A layer), I think I would hear it. And note the surround sound mix is also excellent on this release... as on many of my favorite surround music titles, the surrounds are nicely used- loud enough to contribute, not overly used, too loud or too soft, etc.  Bottom line, is I highly recommend this title (and especially in DVD-A surround, it blows me away)... I do wish they sampled it at the full 96/24 res to pull all they could from the original master tapes- but I'll take it exactly the way it is.  P.S. I haven't evaluated any of the video features or extras on this title as of yet... will probably check this out at some point and post an update.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|This is the fourth item I have ordered from DBroth and is my last.  If you want junk then go ahead and order.  I will sell you a bag junk, and guaranty that is junk. They sell cheap, and if you order from them you are, well on your own.This AWUSO360NHR runs about ten minutes and then fails, unplug and replug and get ten more minutes.

B005F6NA56|5.0|Not surprisingly, the lack of an itunes commercial ready song, has impacted the amount of people exposed to this album. And it is sad. This is my first Feist album, i had heard of her when she broke out big with 1234, but never actually took the time to check out the album. I don't feel however, that i will ever love her other albums as much as this one. This collection of songs is sad, and moody, and dark. but so painfully beautiful. It will not be for everyone. If you liked her for her poppy, happy songs, she doesn't deliver those here. But never-the less, if you like sad songs, beautiful songs, you will find them here. Personal favorites are Bittersweet melodies, which really breaks my heart, but is so breathtaking. Anti pioneer which has a great slow jazz vibe, that awesome guitar part! The circle married the line, The good in each other, and of course, how come you never go there, which is what sold me on this album in the first place. This was a slow grower for me, but really it is an \\"album\\". it has a theme and a mood and holds together so well. its what i wanted from Adele and Florence + the machine this year but didn't get. These are great songs, and this is easily my favorite album of the year.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|When I finished reading the book, \\"The Help,\\" I immediately went back and read it AGAIN! Just to make sure it was what I thought it was.  This book hit home for me because I am--now--a 66 year-old White southerner who was raised by an African-American woman who was for all intents and purposes my mother. Not that I did not love my parents--both of them--but the day to day life an upper class white child in the 1950's south from year 1 to 6 was in the company of this wonderful lady, her husband and her friends. I would be in her church on Wednesday Prayer Meetings, Sunday night Services and often would play with the children of the adult friends of his lady, me being the ONLY white child among them.  I was very lucky because I feel that I had a COMPLETE southern upbringing.  I can also say that my mother who was president of the local PTA was instrumental in making the Transition from segregation to integration in 1954-1955 in our local school as smooth as possible.  When I finally saw the movie \\"The Help\\" last summer all of these memories poured over me.  I remembered Mary and the way she raised me--which is what she did--to adulthood.  She was kind but strict.  No sassing. So back talk and always say Yes 'Mam and Yes Sir to adults...including HER!!!!  I went and visited her grave recently and said a little prayer of thanks.  This movie is very special to me. Every character in the movie has a corresponding person in my own growing up.   It was a very emotional experience for me.  EXCEPT for one SMALL detail.....no southern Black church in the 1950's would EVER have a minister THAT YOUNG. Good actor but totally unbelievable.    But other than that,\\"The Help\\" was a winner for me.
B000003S5H|5.0|As the name suggests, listening to Air's Moon Safari does not seem to be about a world that we're familiar with. By the first track, you are strapped into your aural rocket ship and allowing the gravity to slip away from you. You fly beyond the atmosphere into a different world far away.  Each track of the wonderfully rich album is a new experience like visiting a new planet; it is exotic and foreign yet comforting in its tranquil nature. We're not scared to go beyond what we know. In fact, by the end of the album, we crave more. In a dreamlike state, the mix of voice, synthesizer, and real instruments is a lovely amalgam of the known and the unknown, the tactile and the intangible, the present and the future. At length, the album manages to remain both serene and interesting in its variety of textures, instruments, and timbres, not an easy feat in collection featuring mainly slow tempos with subtle melodies. It is through the incredible development and variety of textures and timbres achieved that gives Moon Safari its rich fabric of sound and its alien elegance.   Moon Safari was Air's, a duo featuring French musicians Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel, first album released in 1998. Incredibly well-received, it quickly became the standard of electronic chill-out music, and no other album has been considered as skillful or interesting as it. Its popularity and legacy was so great that the album was rereleased ten years later in 2008 with an extra disc. This was my first time listening to the original album all the way through and it is not hard to see the appeal. While soothing and elegant in its tranquility, it does not lack at all in interesting and innovative music that is constantly morphing and manipulating into something unexpected and new. The music is incredibly effective, creating more like an entire environment and an all-encompassing sound experience instead of just aural pieces. Air's music is not especially dynamic in mood or volume, but it is absolutely not to be mistaken for boring and static.   Many of the tracks of Moon Safari begin with an unrecognizable ambience that melts into the dominant rhythm and melody of the piece. The rhythms and melodies patiently emerge, and are constantly developing one they arrive. Using an array of instruments including but not limited to synthesizers, percussion, bass, keyboards, and the human voice. Some of the instrumental tracks lean towards a bluesy and funky feel with electronic infusion, such as \\"La Femme D'Argent.\\" Other tracks, especially ones featuring the human voice, like \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"All I Need,\\" are more sultry and sensual in their sound and are intriguing juxtapositions of voice and electronic ambience. Air implements the human voice in other ways by electronically processing it into a nearly unrecognizable musical element that fades in and out of the other electronic instruments of the song. This can be seen especially in \\"Remember.\\"  In my opinion, it is the later tracks on the album that are especially enchanting. I feel that these tracks use a particularly rich variety of textures and really evoke distinct moods, especially the last two tracks \\"Ce Matin La\\" and \\"New Star in the Sky,\\" which are both strikingly emotive and varied.   Listening to Moon Safari gives one the feeling that they are floating by a strange and unfamiliar world. The music takes many qualities from our own reality, like the human voice and familiar instruments, but Air has tweaked and twisted these qualities into something that does not quite resemble what we know here on Earth. The resulting sounds create a world strange to us, but also tranquil and soothing in nature. We release ourselves from our reality and let Air guide us through the album, showing us their new world. It is almost a passive activity listening to this album:  all you have to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful and exotic voyage that Air takes you on.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|After reading all the reviews I was a bit leary about buying this Marware cover.  I like the light weight cover, great protection, the stand works fine if you use the elastic as shown in the photo on amazon.com.  I first purchased one of the Marware leather covers and quickly returned the bulky, over priced, poorly made leather cover.  This cover is a keeper!  How could they improve the cover? Some sort of strap to put your hand in to help hold the device.  Over all I am very happy with the cover.
0307593312|5.0|I absolutely loved \\"1Q84.\\"<br /><br />I have read most of Haruki Murakami's novels and this might be my favorite.  At first I was intimidated at the over 900 pages but they went by really quick.  Towards the end, I was sorry to finish it because it was so enjoyable.<br /><br />If you have never read Murakami before, you should probably start with \\"Kafka on the Shore.\\"  If you have already read some of his novels and short stories, you already know what to expect.  He takes you to a world that looks like our world but is remarkably different.<br /><br />There is nothing else quite like it.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|I have not read the first 4 books but I have seen the movies.  I bought this one because I planned on seeing the movie and didn't want to wait for Pt2 for the ending.  In retrospect, I should've watched the movies first, then I would've a better idea about the book.  Anyway, I bought it and I read it.  It may be a bit harsh to call it crap but then it may not be.    The first few chapters almost left me wondering if I clicked the wrong book and bought a Harlequin Romance by mistake.  The \\"Edward is so perfect, I don't deserve him\\" theme surfaced again and again and again.  By the middle of the book, you pretty much know that there's not going to be any sort of conflict.  Every problem will be resolved because Bella is, as everyone but Bella can see, practically perfect in power and beauty.  I was bored.
0316098329|3.0|I read this book after reading all the wonderful reviews that it received. It was a decent read, but didn't live up to the hype. I'd classify it as an easy beach read-definitely not a book that was going to stick with you after you finished the last page. With all the great books out there, I'd leave this one on the shelf.

0307593312|2.0|This book really need an editor.  After reading the first 60 pages I started scheming to see if I was missing something interesting.  Unfortunately nothing but blah blah blah and more blah blah blah.  While the premises of the story make the book appear to be interesting (parallel world), the writer appears to be under the influence, as the story appears to have no end. While I found the beginning interesting and the main characters enough developed, I was totally disappointed by the book repetitiveness, and the author obsession with genital parts.  Do we need to know that one of the characters mom was having her beast sucked by a grown up man, or do we need to have a description of someone touching someone else genitalia?  The scenes don't add value to the book, and in many instance are so juvenile that they are not worth reading or repeating.

1594744769|4.0|Strange and beautiful, Riggs has assembled a collection of vintage pictures of children in various stages of weird for his best-selling debut novel with Quirk Books. It's a bit like digging through history to find the misfits time has shuffled away in a box. Shoved under the bed and forgotten, Riggs brings the photos and the story of the bizarre orphanage back into the light, weaving history through its fingers and tangling the truth about their origins.<br /><br />After the murder of his grandfather and doubting his own hold on reality, Jacob travels to a remote island off the coast of Wales. Following only scant information about the whereabouts of the orphanage and wild tales he'd heard as a child from his grandfather, Jacob becomes involved in the lives of the children that time forgot. As their existence is threatened, Jacob has a decision to make: return home to the family who doesn't understand him or remain with the Peculiars.<br /><br />An adventure story with more than a hint of menace, MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN brings out the best in a young adult novel: suspense, a tiny bit of romance, and characters you can't wait to read more about. I look forward to Riggs' next installment.<br /><br />Note: Yep, this will be given to a truckload of tweens/teens for Christmas. Amazon is ho-ho-hoing already.

0307593312|4.0|First of all, I find it funny how everyone complained that Wind-Up Bird was ruined in the English translation because it was abridged.  So Murakami comes back and hits us with all 920 pages of 1Q84 and now it's too long!  I hate putting any plot summaries in reviews, so here's what I liked and didn't like:  Likes:  1.  Classic Murakami engagement I don't get with most other authors.  I felt it from the first page of the first Murakami book I read (Kafka) and felt it all the way through the others (Wind-Up Bird, South of the Border, After Dark.)  2.  I also liked the secondary characters with one exception.  The dowager, Fuka-Eri, Komatsu, Tamaru, and many others managed to have depth despite playing background roles.  3.  Mixing of the fantastic and the mundane like nobody else can.  Related to 1, I don't really like or seek out surreal works, but Murakami is the exception.  4.  Compelling plot once reduced from the bloat -- A pleasant love story mixed in with some underworld crime and detective elements.  Dislikes:  1.  Just too darn long -- would have been a good 400-pager or a great 300-pager, but not 920.  Unlike other Murakami works I've read, there were places that just felt like filler.  Particularly the later Tengo and Aomame chapters -- just hook up already!  (still, I finished in record time for me given the length)  2.  Ushikawa -- minor supporting character given POV chapters in book 3 with no real point other than to add bloat  3.  More loose ends than usual for Murakami -- not to an infuriating degree, but an awful lot is left unanswered in a somewhat unsatisfying way  Overall -- a good book, but as others have said, not an ideal introduction to one of my favorite authors.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was a bit worried when I ordered this case because many folks were disappointed while others thought it was great. I've had it for a few days now and I'm relieved to say that I'm one of the latter. I understand the need to have a nice leather case for some things but I was worried about it being too big. The Marware MicroShell is light, feels great, and does what I need without adding hardly any bulk to the dimensions of the Fire.<br /><br />The Kindle fits snugly into a firm plastic case with rounded corners. Nothing covers the screen (or even the outer frame) and there are cut-outs in the sides for the speakers and the power button, port, & jack. The cover folds over from the left and has a nice, soft cloth material on the inside that touches the screen. There is an elastic band that you can use to hold the cover in place when you need it.<br /><br />The cover folds back and has a crease that allows you to bend it so that it fits in a slot on the back part of the case. This allows you to stand the Fire horizontally. Many people have commented on how unstable this is but that's not my experience. My guess is this function is mainly for watching video but I find that I can touch the screen to do other things too. While it certainly isn't rock solid, I haven't had the case fall over either. For extra support, you can stretch the elastic band over the \\"stand\\" if needed. The stand only works one way so you can't use it vertically (portrait mode), which would be even more unstable anyway.<br /><br />I'm not sure how best to describe the feel of the soft plastic but it is more like rubber. Brushed plastic, perhaps? It's not a hard plastic.<br /><br />If you are looking for something plush with space for a pen or pockets for papers, don't buy this. If you want something small and lightweight that does a more than adequate job of protecting your Kindle, this might be a good option.<br /><br />Update 3/21/12: I'm still very pleased with this cover. It is holding up very well. No cracks, tears, or other obvious signs of wear. The inside \\"felt\\" picks up lint but that is easy to clean. I rarely use the elastic band so I can't speak to its durability. I am so glad I opted for this light cover instead of something bulky.

0140544518|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old niece because she LOVES to read books.  It's for Christmas so I don't know if she'll like it but I sure do!!!  Funny, funny book.  They say there are always two sides to every story.  Well this one is it.  Recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  Easy to play, but not always so easy to win; which is what keeps me coming back to it again and again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|WOW!!! I bought the trilogy and literally read it in a week, even though I work full time. Stayed up late, read a little every chance I got.  There were parts where I was so exhausted from being up so late reading it but couldn't fall asleep because I was too anxious to read more. I own over 1,000 books in print, plus those on my Kindle and none has ever touched me as much as this series.  I felt like I was going through the games with Katniss; suffering what she did; and I found myself begging for the ending I wanted the closer I got to the end.  This is worth buying just for the plot alone, but it's the way she brings the characters and situations alive that grab you and keep you enthralled.  Unlike so many series' there's no quick wrap up that leaves you feeling cheated.  I'm actually sad to have finished it.
0451232577|5.0|I was first introduced to the writings of Ken Follet by reading the Best-sellers \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World without End\\". I really enjoyed both books given the historical settings and the great story telling. I continued to read some of his other books, but none of them quite matched the first books I read.  That is, until \\"Fall of Giants\\". This is my personal favourite Ken Follet book.   I can't believe people gave this book such a bad rating, since if I could give it a rating it would be 6 out of 5.
B005F9CPG8|3.0|Well, I have not reviewed Beatles product in some time & this remaster from the 2009 recordings is as I say \\"What It Is\\" which is a \\"Best Of\\" the singles on one CD. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but frankly it is a single CD missing important \\"Double\\" \\"B\\" sides which were included on the \\"Red\\" / \\"Blue\\" double CD's. I actually recommend them over this single CD if you have the extra bread but, if your looking for a solid CD, then this is the ticket. I wish they would have put this out with the original singles as they were released on 45rpms but well, the record companies are looking out for the consumer. Surprised there are not more complaints about the tracks that are in mono on this set, of course \\"Love Me Do\\" is only mono but someone will always complain if they are not familiar with The Beatles output. So if your looking for a X-Mas gift for 2011 then this might be a good bet.<br />Stop by my website sometime and say \\"Hi\\" @ JudeMac Forever, Google it.

B000I0QM04|2.0|I fit only one gay stereotype perfectly - I adore art deco, Norman Bel Geddes, and modernist architecture/design. This also means I love the 1920s and 1930s. So, the look of this film is spot-on perfect for me and my aesthetic sense.<br /><br />The characters could have been more effective if they hadn't been so close to being like characters from an earlier era of film. They were basically cardboard cutouts of film archetypes. None of them, except for Giovanni Ribisi's \\"Dex\\", are likable and the adventure aspect was difficult to enjoy because I didn't give a damn about anyone involved - - except for Dex. After realizing and saying all this, though, I'm quite likely to watch the film multiple times because of how much I love the look and feel of it. (After finally receiving a positive vote on this review, I've returned to clean-up some of the errors)
B005N95JA4|5.0|the twelve additional songs on the reissue are best stuff i have heard from the stones in a long while.a lot of it is in the country rock genre,with ronnie wood on pedal steel,a pleasant surprise
B002ZG98FU|2.0|I did not like this movie. I love Rachel McAdams, she's stunning and a good actress. I think, that yes, though she was extra perky in this movie and constantly swiping at her bangs, she played her character well. I was disappointed with Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford. They are such great actors and their parts were reduced to sniveling and snapping counterparts (especially Ford). For the talent the two of them have, I was very disappointed, as Harrison Ford was one of the main reasons I watched this film. Also disappointing was the language. Good grief, this is PG-13? That and Rachel's character hopping into bed on her second date. In the movies, sex is always carefree and no strings attached. I was ready to stop watching, but I figured there just had to be a good ending, and I was correct. One of the few things I liked about this movie was the father/daughter relationship that emerges between Rachel and Harrison Ford and the ending was perfect, touching and even a tad humorous. Worth the time I put into the movie? No. But at least, the film wasn't completely a waste. Final verdict? Don't bother.

B0000B1OGD|5.0|\\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" is a cult-classic that I remember from Saturday afternoons growing up.  The special effects were good for the era, but seem cheesy by today's standards.  In spite of being what I would classify as a 'B-movie', I think you will find the film actually has a story-line that doesn't have big gaps.
6305428042|5.0|I have seen this movie a number of times and always enjoy it. I suppose that says it all really. If you can watch a movie more than once it has to be good. So much so I ordered it through Amazon when I could not locate it here at home.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|My wife and I each got a new iPhone 4S. She wanted a pink case. I got her an iFrogz TPS case for $20.  This Amazon Basics case is almost identical for $9., and included a screen cover.  If you want a clear or smoke colored case and like the soft, but not sticky, consistency of TPC, this is the brand for you.
B00008EY9G|3.0|I did not feel that it was consistently good.  When it ws good, it waas real good but when cold, not so good. The revelation I feel really takes away from the movie because it is such a cheap answer to the questions in the viewers mind. In spite of that I would have given it 4 stars if it were not for the very cheesy, cliche last scene.Most of what can be said (and shouldn't be said because it spoils the movie) has been said in other reviews. Overall, the film is well done in terms of acting and building suspense. But it loses a lot when the mystery is revealed.
1451627289|5.0|Ever since his accident, I've thought that my favorite author had lost something...  Whatever it was that kept him from creating terrific stories has returned - first with the Dome and now with 11/23/63.  It's funny how a man that is best - most widely - known for horror, can write such wonderful, complex and emotional stories.  Long may you live Stephen King.  Welcome back.
B002C6K7NA|1.0|This man can't sing, and he doesn't have much to say.  The music doesn't move me either: it's a wall of production, but there's no meat on the bone.  For better fare of post Skynyrd music, I would much prefer listening to the old Rossington Collins Band.  That band could play and that lady could sing.  and not only that, but the compositions were excellent.  Furthermore, imo, it's just wrong that this schlop is being added into the vaulted Lynyrd Skynyrd canon.  'Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel.'
B000002GVO|5.0|It's funny... I swear I should have been born in another decade other than the nineties, which, in my opinion, contained the worst music through the decades.  Just this past summer, while perusing through a glorious flea market, I came upon an album.  Mint condition it was in, and for just five dollars, I considered it a steal.  Hotel California (1976) by the Eagles is perhaps one of the most influential albums of all time.  A small local band they began as, but their influence on music rocked generations.  I only regret that I wasn't there to experience it firsthand.  Yet reliving the magic this way is part of the joy that I get from vinyl record shopping.  It is very difficult for me to listen to CDs now, after hearing the unique sounds of an album on vinyl.  For the most part, all of my favorite albums were originally released on vinyl and then re-released on disc form.  There is just something about placing the needle, listening to the slight, natural scratches, and then flipping it over to begin the magic all over again.   But I digress.   Taking it home to play on my record player, I feel excited.  I had never heard many of the songs, even though they had been recorded over thirty years before.  Unlike all of my other records, there isn't a song that I do not like on this album.  It is rare nowadays to find such a gem, especially when you can simply buy only the songs that you like, instead of having to buy the entire vinyl or CD.    As the record begins to spin faster, I admire the album cover while waiting for the music to begin.  Covers used to be somewhat of a competition with other bands.  There were rarely any other sources of pictures for the music, and often times, the cover was the artistic representation of what the album was supposedly about.  While this cover isn't as spectacular as say Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it is very reminiscent of the overall music: mysterious and exotic.  I have to admit that this is something that I miss aboutmusic these days: the artwork.  With iTunes, all you purchase is the song, not the artwork that comes with the music.  When I rifle through records, I specifically look at the cover, and even if I don't necessarily know the artist, if the cover artwork is beautiful, it is worth the money.  Finally, the first haunting sounds of \\"Hotel California\\" caress my ears and instantly relax me.  Perhaps one of the most recognizable songs in music, I immediately respect it for what it is: an instant and timeless classic, chockfull of hidden literary devices.  Don Henley's unbelievable voice captures you and pulls your mind into this Californian world he creates, filled with materialism and overindulgence.  The pessimism combined with surrealism throughout the song creates an incredibly eerie mood; ultimately, it combats the idea of an American Dream and presents a darker image of the paradise that America was thought to be, and not just California.  Concluding the song is some of the best guitar work in music history.  Don Felder and Joe Walsh battle it together out in a mind blowing, yet somehow note-perfect way, for almost two minutes.  Certainly a fantastic song and only a sneak peak at what is to come!  \\"New Kid in Town\\" may be completely different than \\"Hotel\\" in terms of subject matter, but it maintains that timeless feel to it.  The phenomenal harmonies compliment Glenn Frey's silky smooth voice to really illustrate a hopeless romantic feel.  Clocking in at just over five minutes, it is definitely one of my personal favorites of the Eagles.  Despite the country-esque feeling to it, the lyrics and backup vocals make this song a perfect one to turn up the dial on your speakers (or turntable) and lament over a lost love.    However, who thinks that the Eagles are a country should just listen again to the raucous electric guitar riff that starts off \\"Life in the Fast Lane.\\"  Much more edgy than any other song on the album and keeping the overall theme of excessive materialism, it is a great one to blast and will \\"surely make you lose your mind.\\"  A forgettable song, but \\"Fast Lane\\" is still a vital one to have on the album.  Transitioning strangely, the Eagles continue their pattern of a mellower song after a brash one.  \\"Wasted Time\\" is a lyrical ballad with beautiful electric guitar parts intermingled before and after the chorus.  The tortured vocals emanate from Henley and really reflect the lyrics.  Again, the Eagles have some of the best harmonic chord progressions there are, both vocally and instrumentally, and it is plainly evident on \\"Wasted Time.\\"  You won't want to miss this one, which closes the first side of the album in a very ethereal and otherworldly way.  Flipping the album over, I cringe at the thought of a reprise.  Honestly, I hate them.  I just listened to the song once already, and although I understand that it helps to transition into the next tune, it just doesn't seem necessary.  But this one is necessary.  On the contrary, \\"Wasted Time (Reprise)\\" is a must for this album.  I suppose that is one good thing about CDs; the songs flow into each other without the interruption of having to turn the record over and break the overall musicality of the songs.  However, the classic sounds of a string orchestra pulls the listener seamlessly right back into the world of Hotel California.  And at just over a minute, it doesn't distract and most importantly leads right into the next great tune.  \\"Victim of Love\\" is a fun, classic rock `n' roll tune that may not be as edgy as \\"Fast Lane,\\" but it certainly holds its own in terms of guitar licks.  It isn't the lyrics that make this song; to be quite honest, some almost seem too simple and forced (\\"Some people never come clean/I think you know what I mean\\" & \\"Victim of love, you're just a victim of love/I could be wrong but I'm not\\").  Rather it is the grand total of five part harmonies that compliment the screaming slide guitar part and pounding drums.  It's an easy tune to get stuck in your head, but not a bad one, so don't worry if you start humming it.  On the contrary, the next is a much more mellow song entitled \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row.\\"  Certainly not my personal favorite on the album, it is necessary to the record nevertheless; the lyrics, however, are bittersweet as they remind us that it \\"seems like we've come a long way\\" from the beginning of the album.  Again, I am amazed at how effortlessly the guitar parts fit right into this melancholy ballad.  Short and sweet, \\"Pretty Maids\\" is really an observation on life itself, wondering \\"why must we grow up so fast?\\"  \\"Try and Love Again\\" starts out with a well-played guitar riff and immediately interests the listener because of it.  Henley's voice uses various forms of articulation in his vocals, both clipped and sustained.  The lyrics of this one, similar to \\"Pretty Maids,\\" truthfully tell of the harsh realities of life.  This is one of the stronger songs on the second side, for the sounds of the singer's tortured sorrow seem to emanate from the record itself.  Definitely turn this one up, and sing out loud when this one comes on.  \\"The Last Resort\\" is perhaps one of the best songs in the Eagles' song catalogue and definitely my favorite.  It contradicts perfectly with \\"Hotel\\" in terms of themes and even subject matter.  It tells the story of people moving westward (to the Hotel California?) with \\"hopes and dreams\\" about what America had to offer.  This powerful song is more of an environmental statement, as well as a stand against commercialism, as it depicts humans destructing everything nature has to offer us.  As we \\"satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deeds,\\" we end up destroying all the natural beauty of land.  Beginning simply with a piano solo and adding haunting vocals from Henley, it is an important end to the album, as it represents the end of the American Dream.  Clocking in at over seven minutes and filled with moral questions about humanity, \\"The Last Resort\\" still makes one question what the true meaning of \\"paradise\\" is.  This epic's message was important back in the mid-1970s and continues to evoke emotional philosophies about life today in 2011.  I have no doubt in my mind that it will only continue to do so for decades to come.    If you choose to listen to only one Eagles song, let this one be it and listen closely to the lyrics:  \\"Who will provide the grand design?   For what is yours and what is mine?   'Cause there is no more new frontier   We have got to make it here   We satisfy our endless needs and   justify our bloody deeds,   in the name of destiny and the name   of God\\"  Incredibly poignant, \\"The Last Resort\\" definitely helps to make Hotel California an unforgettable album.    Overall, this record may be overrated to some, but there is certainly a reason why people listen to it continuously:  it's an astounding compilation of all types of music, including rock, classical, country, alternative etc.  Perhaps the title song is a little overplayed on the radio, whereas the phenomenal closing song is hardly ever heard anymore.  Nevertheless, I daresay that this is hardly a reason to call such a masterpiece \\"overrated.\\"  Hotel California may be coming up to its fortieth birthday, but it just as could be its fourth, for the themes and musicality within each song continues to remain timeless.

The more i listened the more I realized.  Pink Floyd is all over this album so why not take this rip off and put it away and get the real thing.  The concept is almost eiree when you listen from the Hushed intros to the pickups and the songs.  Its just Floyd is much much better at it.  Coldplay has some decent hits etc.  This just isn't it.  Floyd is better served for this album than this one!
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I still remember the first time I watched this.  I had the biggest crush on Blaine.  I know, I know... Duckie, but Blaine was so very hot!  Of course, now that I'm older, I'm more interested in James Spader (i.e. Steff).  He's a total jerk in this one, but still completely James Spader!!  Love Love Loved Boston Legal!!    But I digress... this is the original story about the spunky outsider who rises above the snobby popular kids.  John Hughes classic, and very 1980s.  Hilarious, and great 1980s hair, fashion, and music.    My only problem?  The prom dress.  I wanted to cry when I saw it. I still can't believe Andie destroyed a gorgeous vintage dress to create that lacy pink...sausage!

B0057R5XRG|4.0|I loved Jurassic Park, liked Lost World, and JP III is my favorite, overall. The story in I & II is great, II was enjoyable, but felt too much like a Jurassic Park/Godzilla spoof to me. As time passed and computer technology improved, the dinosaurs became more believable in each consecutive movie. I won't hold that against any movie as long as the story is there. That would be like complaining about Ray Harryhausen's King Kong or dinosaurs compared to modern CGI (which often supplants the story in modern films).<br /><br />The sound is fantastic & feels like I'm there. The rumbles & roars can shake you to your core (especially if you have a good sub-woofer). The only complaint I can come up with that keeps me from giving this set five stars is that the first movie has a lot of edge artifacts around anything that's moving. This reminds me of what I see when streaming HD movies and can be a little disconcerting at times. In every other way, the blu-ray version is far superior to the DVD.

This book is full of great tips and tricks that can get you working now, and keep you in that zone. Learn what resistance really is, and free yourself of the guilt that comes from giving into it. Instead, learn how to to engage in active battle with it, and to overcome it day-by-day.   Highly recommended.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|Being a fan of all Kate's albums, it feels that she has in some ways come full circle, returning to the evocative simplicity of her early work but creating new moods and atmospheres that are fresh and intriguing. After listening to this for a few weeks, it has a special meaning to me. I often play it as a late evening chill out.   Just listening to her in the latest radio interviews, Kate clearly has never seemed happier and her musical Mojo remains undimmed. It seems she already has ideas for her next project and we will be hearing of her more often in the years ahead.  Not so much a collection of songs, but 7 short story 'tone poems'. I welcome Kate's experiment with longer song structures to lose oneself in.  Whilst I would admit this is not an album of catchy seasonal ditties, this album needs patience and repeated listens in order to fully appreciate its beauty. Kate is an artist who produces work on her own terms, free from the shackles of the demands of fan blogs and the music industry establishment.  My general impressions: Shut out the world, put on this album and immerse yourself for an hour uninterrupted in Kate's winter wonderland. Despite only a few listens, new details and elements of the stories are starting to develop in my head. This work is so organic, evocative and dreamy. Forget your troubles and the recession, just escape into Kate's alternative world.  Snowflake: Kate views snow as a substance transforming a landscape or garden with its physical beauty. Kate finds the world so loud and 'lowest common denominator' sometimes, whilst snowflakes are all unique and individual. With repeated listenings, the repeated piano and Bertie motifs become less intrusive and ghostly sounding electronic keyboard details emerge from the mix. Love's Steve Gadds evocation of horses through snowdrifts.   Lake Tahoe: Perhaps the most ambitious song on the album, Kate giving the song an almost classical feel. Stefan Roberts makes a memorable contribution, his openinglines remind me of the end of Hello Earth from the album Hounds of Love. The haunting theme of a dog's almost mythical journey to be reunited with its owner is simple yet atmospheric and moving. This is Kate at her storytelling best.  Misty: I love the almost jazzy feel of Steve Gadd's sunlime drum work. The sequence 'I turn off the light, switch on a starry night' is almost akin to an out of body experience, makes me think of the scene in the film Little Voice, when we first see Jane Horrocks character singing/playing music in her bedroom. 'When I kiss his ice-cream lips' is Kate at her musically bonkers best!!!  Wild Man: The most pop-oriented and perhaps the most immediately accessible track on the album, marking perhaps the beginning of the albums second section. Steve Gadd's hypnotic drums, Andy Fairweather Low's full and throaty chorus and Del Palmer's bells are highlights. Kate's interpretation is an intriguing mix of fear, pity and intrigue for the mythical Yeti.  Snowed In At Wheeler Street: Whilst not particularly well versed in the music of Elton John and despite the controversy evinced by some fans, I think this really does 'work', particularly with Elton's soulful delivery. The idea of the love and loss of friends and lovers by humanity as a universal trait through the centuries is great. Love Kate's increasingly frantic vocal towards the end.  50 Words For Snow: No Kate album is ever complete without a lighter, fun moment. Wacky, this song follows in the tradition of the Big Sky and the song Aerial, whilst keeping to this album's feel. I don't think this track needs to be over-analysed.  Among Angels: A return to the piano-based delivery of the first 3 songs, it is clearly not about snow. Quite simply this song is to me one of the most moving songs she has ever written in her whole career. There is an underlying theme of personal loss, perhaps partly inspired by the recent death of her father, but I feel there is a more general message, about self-belief. We often overlook that the beginnings of a resolution to inner conflicts lies within our own souls.

B005F6NA56|3.0|First off, I'm glad I purchased the record, as there are some great tracks on here.  The production on the album is fantastic, really beautiful strings and choral sections.  That said, about half of the album is just...boring.  I am a big fan of Let It Die, so I actually like the softer delicate Feist songs, but those songs on Metals just lay there lifeless.  Some of it may be the lyrics, lots of nature imagery that goes nowhere in my opinion.  After a few listens I find myself skipping almost half the tracks on the album, thus the three star review.  Best song on the album, track 11 Comfort Me, followed closely by the opener The Bad In Each Other.  Standout tracks for me - 1,4,5,6,9 and 11.

First bug I noticed is having a pawn captured by a pawn that has already past another pawn. In like manner not being able to take a pawn that was clearly in a position to be captured.  I also noticed a few times where the program did not acknowledge that I had my opponents king in check.  I completly enjoy playing, but a score of 3 stars is generous considering the incorrect logic that hinders your ability to maximize your skill.
0061351342|5.0|This is my favorite book in the whole Universe!  I have been reading many different versions, in different languages, for the last 14 years, and I can always find something new every time I read it. Its magic lies on simplicity.  This version is simply beautiful, from the cover to the pictures, it is a very unique item, one that you must own if you love this book.  Definitely, a book that can change lives.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE these boots! I'm very pleased with my purchase and I wouldn't even dare return them. If you are looking into these definitely buy them - you will be satisfied.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Prompt shipping. Pink Floyd rocks in this dvd. The light show is incredible, the music is mind bending good, the theatrical stage show is shock and awe. I love the part when the airpline flies through the stadium and crashes into the wall. The people who got tickets got their money's worth and so will you if you buy this dvd. rock on!
B004XIZN5M|4.0|This review pertains to the routine itself, rather than the controversy surrounding the author and whether or not he was incarcerated. I also should note that I purchased the Kindle edition, so the cost was quite reasonable. I'm an amateur powerlifter and I was looking for a way to incorporate some body weight exercises into my training in a progressive fashion. My current training is based on Jim Wendler's \\"5/3/1\\" books, which are excellent.   Ok, now for a brief review: Convict Conditioning does a great job of laying out a ten-step plan of how a trainee can work toward completing the full version of the very difficult \\"Big Six\\" exercises. The ten-steps for each exercise start very easy, but will teach the skills and build the strength required to do some very challenging body weight exercises. The progression will also work great for women, especially with upper-body exercises, which are often more difficult for the ladies than for men. The first steps will seem very elementary and easy for those of us who already have a training background, although some \\"easy\\" work at first might do some good for our joints.   Even though this book is about body weight training, its purpose is building a great deal of strength and athleticism. Of course, it's possible to build great endurance using body weight exercises, but the routines in this book are geared toward building functional strength.   Overall, I'm happy with the book because it gives the reader a useful, progressive, step-by-step program.
B004INNRFK|1.0|Was excited for this duo of CD & DVD. Played the DVD first on my Sony DVD/Recorder player & it froze suddenly & unable to even worked the remote. Have to turn off the player to get the DVD out. Tried it in a Blu-ray player & error message appeared on screen. Tried it on older DVD player - it played the menu nothing else & froze the player again!   The CD worked but bought this for the DVD on it. I have yet to contact Amazon.com - I hate the hazzle of returning stuff. I will get another one at Best buy.
B0002X314C|5.0|I can't believe I purchased this album seven years ago and haven't done a review of it. When I first listened to it I thought, \\"This is the best R&B album that I have purchased in a long time.\\" It had the honesty of Kanye West's now classic \\"The College Dropout\\" which came earlier the same year, the hipness of Musiq Soulchild's \\"Juslisen,\\" and the sincerity of Alicia Keys' \\"Diary of Alicia Keys.\\" I must admit that \\"Ordinary People\\" got me to buy the album. I remember hearing \\"Ordinary People\\" before the whole world caught wind of its magnificence and immediately knew it was a timeless song. After hearing the album in its entirety, I was sold. Each song rang like a story told with a soul stricken and emotional delivery wrapped in a vintage sound and laced with elements of hip hop. What more could I ask for? There was even gospel elements that elevated the album to  a new high. Legend's use of the piano was superb; he didn't use it as a crutch to create ambiance. His voice delivered most, if not all of the message he wanted to tell. From beginning to end, \\"Get Lifted\\" managed to do what most albums fail to: Invite You, Convince You, and Keep You. Classic & Brilliant. Job well done Mr. Legend.
B001BPJJ1E|3.0|This reminds me of the early Bee Gees music in the 1980's. I have been looking for this movie for more than 20 years. The movie itself is simple & sweet but the background music & songs reminds me of my younger years. The clarity of the DVD is less desirable but can't fault it - surely it was probably copied from a VHS or Betamax tapes. LOL. Still love the musicality of the whole thing.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I don't know about most people but this collection is very simple and to the point. It has every movie in its theatrical release with no extra discs or other content. This product is exactly what I wanted.
1576875776|3.0|I've loved Vivan's work since the day I saw it in The British Photography Journal. I was excited about this book for months. I really had expected it to be amazing like what I have seen on the website. The blank pages are fine by me it is similar to Robert Frank's The Americans which also had blank pages in the 1st edition but later were taken out. They give the book room to breath. The reason why I am giving this book a review of a 3 is because the prints are very hard for me to look at. They are not printed in a true black and white they have this disgusting sepia tone to them it is slight enough that it bothers my eyes a terrible amount. I do not feel that these pictures have to have this tacky nostalgia look to them. I hope that someone important reads this and prints a copy in true black and white, or by some chance im the only one who got a sepia book. I ordered a second one for my mother so I hope that It will be truely black and white.
B00006RSM1|5.0|Pleased with the whole transaction. Lists of song titles for cd's is great. The item was delivered in a timely fashion. Ordering process was easy to use.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Roman Polanski adapts Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte's El Club Dumas and makes a near masterpiece... an esoteric neo-noir mystery disguised as a tale of the supernatural. At its heart, The Ninth Gate warns us of the dangers of the pursuit of secret and forbidden knowledge; Satan/Lucifer is merely a representation of knowledge we are not meant to consume (at least not everyone), but our eternal curiosity compels us into such forbidden terrain, perhaps leading those who are unworthy into damnation and perdition, and those who are worthy, into the light of erudition and truth.
0140277447|5.0|To this day, Japan refuses to acknowledge history.<br /><br />It does not print accurate history in its schoolbooks, and the national Japanese attitude is an extremely off-putting and whiny one: \\"We didn't start WWII.  We only fought on defense.\\"<br /><br />So: Pearl Harbor goes down the memory hole, and so does the Rape of Nanking. While the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are memorialized year after year by thousands of \\"innocent Japanese.\\"<br /><br />Once you open this horrifying book by the late Iris Chang, the myth of the \\"innocent Japanese\\" will vanish before your eyes.  Iris Chang is a very good writer, and she begins her highly informative book with a mini-history of Japan which is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />She then proceeds to the subject: The Rape of Nanking.  She deals with it by imitating the famous film \\"Rashomon:\\" she tells the entire story from three different perspectives.  These are the perspective of the Japanese (many of them horrified), the perspective of the Chinese victims, and the perspective of the Europeans living in Nanking, who established a \\"safe zone\\" for the desperate Chinese and kept copious notes on the Rape of Nanking.<br /><br />The Japanese massacred 300,000 innocent Chinese here.  If you want to fetch out your slide rule of evil, you may note that both atomic bombs dropped on Japan did not reach this level of slaughter.  If you read this book, you will also note that the massive rape, slaughter and torture carried out by the Japanese during the Rape of Nanking was extremely personal.  Women were gang-raped, and then instantly killed (if they were not tortured before death.)<br /><br />This is mandatory reading, especially for zealots who believe that the West is the source of all evil.  It is particularly disturbing that the Japanese, unlike the Germans, simply refuse to admit their past actions, which are becoming universally known.<br /><br />More than one Japanese soldier said that they were deliberately trained to be \\"devils.\\"<br /><br />It is wonderful that the truth emerges at last.last.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I grew up on the films of Steven Spielberg.  He made me fall in love with the movies and led me to how magical they can be.  Some films are about dark, gritty subject matter, some show us beautiful sunsets, some terrify us...Spielberg sought to take the magical way a child views the world and make it real, and in essence, reminded us as adults, that a little of that magic still lives inside of us.  We still long for that sense of awe and wonder.  Sci-fi (a genre I never have considered myself a fan of) at its best, should inspire an a sense of awe, wonder, and moreover, ...possibility.  \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" took us on a journey like that through the eyes of an ordinary man.  \\"E.T.\\" took us on the same path but through the eyes of a child trying to cope with the pain of his parents' divorce.  It is this very innocent and beautiful glance inward that gives rise to the masterpiece called \\"Super 8\\".  A summer movie that reminded me how good summer movies used to be before they were taken over by comic book heroes and sequels.  \\"Super 8\\", written and directed by JJ Abrams (MI: III, Star Trek, TV's Lost), is the best summer movie I have seen in at least 2 decades.  It is inspired by Spielberg's ouevre, ad it certainly makes sese that Spielberg produced this as well.  Set in the mid-1970s, Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends who set out to make a zombie movie with a Super 8mm camera.  The kids are around 1-14years old, and the pack is led by Joe Lamb (played beautifully by Joel Courtney).  Joe is a smart, senitive and creative kid who recently lost his mother is an accident.  Courtney is an actor to watch especially watching how deftly he imbues Joe with a fresh-faced sensitivity and wisdom beyond his years withou ever once becoming cloying.  Much the same can be said if the other young actors who fill out his group of friends, among them is Alice (played by Elle Fanning of \\"The Door in the Floor\\"), who is a potential love interest for Joe.  One night while filming their zombie flick, a train derails, nearly killing the lot of them.  This sequence makes up the most exciting and spectacular action scenes and bit of special effects of last summer.  It make the train wreck in \\"The Fugitive\\" look like amateur hour.  It's a sequence that perfectly mixes action, terror, special effects, and performance.  The rest of the film deals with what's in the train and how it affects the town and the characters.  None of which I would dare spoil.  \\"Super 8\\" flooded me with such nostalgia...not just of summer movies past, but of American boyhood, endess summers, and the promise of adventure.  Joe and his friends are at the age where they stand on the precipice of believing in magic and leaving it behind for adulthood. The movie is exciting, often very scary, and very moving.  The adult cast is nicely filled out by \\"Friday Nigh Lights\\" Kyle Chandler as Joe's dad and the town Sherriff, Noah Emmerich (The Walking Dead) as a mysterious military heavy, and Ron Eldard (Deep Impact) as Alice's troubled, alcoholic,and very sad dad.    Director JJ Abrams has made a superior thriller that gives us everything we want in our summer movies.  Action, excitement, lots of humor, brilliant special effects by Industrial Light & Magic, but most of all heart and soul.  Abrams has shown himself as an auteur and not just a brilliant action meastro. In a summer over-stuffed with superhero films with bloated $200 budgets, Abrams made his spectacular tale for a relatively thrifty $50 million.  This goes to show that hundreds of millions does not buy a story a heart.  Only an artist cando wht Abrams has done here.  Super * is Oscar-worthy and the best picture of the year.  \\"Super 8\\" is presented on Blu-ray in a dazzling and flawless MPEG 4 AVC codec.  The PQ is immaculate.  I could not find a single flaw.  Colors are bright and robust, contrast is spot on and edgs are razor sharp.  All of tis is achieved without any digital tampering such as DNR or edge enhancement.  Fine detail is crystalline in presentation.  Textures are fully realized.  The image looks more like a window we could put our hand into rather than flat 2D.  Also worth mentioning, Abrams refused to film in 3D as he feels the market is over-saturated with this gimmick.  He's right and good for him.   The audio is a show-stopper with the first of its kind I have heard at a Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  TrueHD is my favorite audio as it sounds the most realistic.  Surrounds are the most enveloping and chillingly real I have ever hard.  The train derailment is a jaw-drpper.  I felt like I was in the middle of it.  My partner and watchd this sequence 3 times in a row.  It is a sequences which should be playing in all big box stores a it will sell HDTVs and Bluray players in record numbers.  This is why I love this technology.  This is the best audio track I have ever heard.  Completed with crisp, perfect dialogue reproduction...this is the track to top going forward.  This disc is the epitome of reference grade, demo material.  The special features are splendid with terrific cast and filmmaker commentaries, awesome featurettes, among others.  Te packasge includes the BD, a SD DVD and digital copy.  Currently as I write this, \\"Super 8\\" is selling for $19.99.  Buy it now.  Don't bother rentin it.  It also makes a great gift for anyone who loves film...and wants to remmber what summer used to feel like.  Rating: A+
B0062P3392|2.0|Based very loosely on the rather interesting 1991 book \\"The Feather Men\\" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, \\"The Killer Elite\\" shows Hollywood cowardice at its best: successfully emasculating, with formulaic, politically correct stereotypes, what should have been a very good film.  While normally enjoying Jason Statham in the various characters he has played on the big screen, watching his character (Danny) and his group of thuggish assassins murder British Special Air Service (SAS) veterans was extremely difficult. And why, you may ask, do Danny and his team kill these SAS veterans? According to the film: in order to save an absurdly cast Robert De Niro. After watching De Niro for about a minute, I would have just left him in the prison and gone out and had a pint with the SAS veterans (and Clive Owen, who was great in this film).   Some of the scenes in this film are very good. And, some of the action sequences, taken in a vacuum, are also very good. However, action and scenery do not make a good film, and \\"The Killer Elite\\" is, sadly, another example of the principle.   The screenwriters not sticking to the original story from Sir Ranaulph's novel was the death blow to \\"The Killer Elite.\\" So, if you are in the mood for yet another Hollywood, watered-down, politically correct, \\"action\\" film, this one is for you. If not, I would still recommend reading the book and then renting this film just to see how bad Hollywood was to the original story.   Two stars (although, I have no doubt, this could have been a four-star quality film).

B005HSG3TC|1.0|I am unsatisfied with this product - for $40.00 I thought it would be a more substantial case - it's nothing but a piece of plastic!
B0010T7R5G|4.0|It came out at the same time as \\"Matrix\\", and \\"Matrix\\" just sucked all of the air out of the room, even though this film is in some ways better. Think of \\"Metropolis\\" updated, with a twisty but understandable plot, and dark style to burn. Don't care if the characters are uni-dimensional, (I mean Keanu Reeves wasn't exactly Gielgud in Matrix), because the dark vibe of the film is compelling. Sure, a lot of the performances (by Hurt and Sutherland especially) are mannered and actorly, but that actually works well with the general otherwordliness of the movie. Bears repeated watching.

B0053YGYO4|2.0|I really hate it when people give a bad album a decent rating just because they like the band. I have all Coldplay's albums and love seeing them live and anywhere I can catch them. Their VH1 storytellers segment a few years back is still one of my fav's ever. That said, the last two albums have seen them on a  downhill slide musically. MX's production shows plenty of money invested but the writing is unispired and lacks all the earthy, heartfelt, intimate yet anthemic charm that albums like parachutes, rush of blood... and even X&Y had. There's a clear evolution from those early albums into Viva La Vida and Mylo Xyloto- and in my book Coldplay has lost what made them so special early on and now they sound just like any other overproduced pop band with a few made for radio tunes and a lot of forgettable fluff. If you can't resist the made for mainstream radio cuts (I admit I can't no matter how much I hate generic pop music), then buy the MP3's for Princess of China, Paradise, and Major Minus (probably the only tune that harkens back to classic coldplay) and spare yourself the disppointment of listening to the rest of the album. God help the boys come to their senses and put the breaks on their downhill slide.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|If you're a fan of Wave Race, you'll definitely be a fan of this game. The graphics are outstanding and it runs VERY smoothly on my Kindle Fire with the occasional minor stutter now and then. I did have another game open in the background, though. As for gameplay, the tilt controls work great and the swiping system for stunts adds an extra level of fun. The only reason I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5 Is because of the fact that there really are only 6 tracks in the game, instead of the described 12. The last 6 are just the first, only in reverse. I would have expected 12 unique tracks for the $5 pricetag. That being said, though, it is a REALLY fun little racer that I think should be picked up. Hopefully there will be dev support that will result in more tracks being released in a future update. Quality stuff here.
1576875776|5.0|I've been following her story for quite some time, and have heard the author speak about Maier at various functions.  I know some followers feel these photographs need to be in more secure hands but from what I can gather, MOMA and many other trusts/companies w/photography experience are not interested in the collection for some reason. I'm sure Maloof doesn't want these photographs falling in to the wrong hands and probably feels responsible for seeing to it that Maier is not forgotten. It seems like he puts a lot of work in to this project and isn't in it for fame or notoriety like some of the other people who own parts of her collection.   I attended the opening for her exhibit at the Cultural Center in Chicago and the turnout was huge, proving that Maier appears to be reaching more people after her death than she did while alive. I'm hoping this book helps make people more aware of her amazing photographers and will probably inspire many to take up photography. It hasn't pushed me to that point yet but I definitely appreciate street photography and it just goes to show that not everyone has an eye for it. I think it's undeniable that Maier truly did have an eye for capturing life at unexpected times.  If you're reluctant to purchase this book because of the price, I feel it is most definitely worth it (in fact, I paid $40 for it so the Amazon price is a great deal!). I can't wait to put this out on my coffee table at Christmas for all my friends and family to browse! I feel like it's almost an insult to call it a \\"coffee table book\\" but it's not the kind of book you want to place on a book shelf to collect dust, so I guess I'll call it a \\"leave-out-somewhere-visible-for-all-to-see book\\". It's a great conversation starter especially if you know the back story, a story of which I am sure we haven't heard the last of!
0307279189|5.0|I loved this book. It changed my whole perspective on running. The characters and story were so engaging I didn't want to stop reading.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Released in 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen 1994's &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; which I liked.<br /><br />The first time I tried to watch &quot;Basterds&quot; I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the long opening sequence was great but the film bogged down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation of WWII and the accompanying interminable dialogue (in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this. I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WWII film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of mostly subtitled dialogue.<br /><br />Well, I finally decided to give it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the &quot;interminable dialogue (with subtitles)&quot; pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. I discovered that the drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.<br /><br />There ARE elements that bring to mind 1967's &quot;The Dirty Dozen,&quot; including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but &quot;Basterds&quot; is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.<br /><br />All effective films have quality characters and &quot;Basterds&quot; has several: The stunning M&eacute;lanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor, who drips with vengeance against the Nazis; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress &amp; British spy; and Daniel Br&uuml;hl as a German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.<br /><br />&quot;Basterds&quot; pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the &quot;blockbuster&quot; syndrome that plagues modern cinema with it's predictability and overKILL action &amp; CGI, etc.<br /><br />The film runs 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.<br /><br />GRADE: A--nonsense leader of the Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress &amp; British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.<br /><br />&quot;Basterds&quot; pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the &quot;blockbuster&quot; syndrome that plagues modern cinema with it's predictability and overKILL action &amp; CGI, etc.<br /><br />The film runs 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.<br /><br />GRADE: A-

0312641893|3.0|I have to admit that of all the fairytales, Cinderella is my favorite.  I think it was all the chores she had to do and how ungrateful her stepmother and stepsisters were, or perhaps it was that she faded into the background.  She was so dirty and small, she was easy to overlook.  As a shy chubby kid with a mean stepfather, I found a lot I could relate to. Mermaids yearning for love, princesses living with dwarves, not so much.<br /><br />This is where Cinder shines, the main character is dirty, her clothing, illfitting and stained with grease and hard labor is an invisible non person, as a cybernetic individual she is even more of a non-person.  She spends her days toiling in a tiny storefront, her mechanical fixing fees the only thing keeping her tiny family afloat.  Her guardian, Adri (evil stepmother times ten) sits at home, watching television and complaining, her only goal in life seems to be making advantageous marriages for her daughters, Peony and Pearl and yelling at Cinder for being a burden and ruining her life.  Cinder was left to Adri by her by dead husband, an inventor named Galen (he's important later on).  Basically, Cinder is Adri's slave, cybernetic people have no rights.<br /><br />Like all fairytale heroines it takes the notice of the hero for Cinder to do something about her situation and to reevaluate her life.  In this case it is Prince Kai.  He stops by to have his favorite android repaired and they share a moment.<br /><br />Now this is where my first, 'huh?' moment happens.  Seriously, I just didn't buy the attraction between Cinder and Kai.  A little backstory on Kai is that he is the kingdom's most eligible bachelor, he's also drop dead gorgeous, Cinder's stepsisters are totally in love with him and scores of girls follow him around wherever he goes(he showed up in a concealing cloak to prevent a riot of lovelorn tweens).  But Cinder acts just as tongue tied and awed as everyone else and for some reason he acts kinda flirty with her.  I didn't buy it at all.  But, hey, not everyone can write in a romance like that of Brittany and Alex (Perfect Chemistry) so I let it go.<br /><br />Unlike Cinderella, there is terrible evil afoot from many directions, the most pressing is the Letumosis plague that has been killing people left and right.  Also up for chills is the Lunar Queen, who has terrible powers and is possibly planning on starting a war with earth.<br /><br />I read the book quickly but several things didn't add up for me, here they are in no real order of importance;<br /><br />1.  Kai and Cinder.  They were kinda instalove.  I could see the attraction from Cinder's side but the quick reciprocity from Kai wasn't believable, the two hardly got a chance to talk to each other, much less become attached.  The descriptions of Cinder made her sound not only ugly, but a-sexual and dirty.  A couple of grease smudges is quirky, actual filth isn't attractive.  Also, something happens in Kai's life that makes everything more serious and busy, I didn't think he'd have much time for flirtations with mechanics.  Plus, he started sharing really important state secrets with her!<br /><br />2.  The Lunar Queen, lunar people and lunar powers in general.  I just couldn't understand how the lunars developed these superpowers (they could control peoples minds, make them do stuff, like put a gun to their heads, kill their family, etc).  They were just too darn powerful and since they were this powerful it didn't make sense that they hadn't attacked earth yet, what could stop them?  There was no reasonable explanation for this and the entire Lunar storyline kinda ruins the book, yet it was a huge part of the story.<br /><br />3.  The technology.  It wasn't steampunk, it was kinda modern but was hard to visualize, I think this could just be me, I need more description to understand the world.<br /><br />4.  How easy it was to break quarantine.  Cinder ran in and out several times.  Same with the palace.<br /><br />5.Several questions were asked but answers were never offered, the first was about the identity chips being removed from the victims of Leutomosis.  The second was about shells (lunars without powers). Then there was something about Galen.  Too many questions, not enough answers.<br /><br />6.  Brutally short - what happened to Peony, what happened to the shopkeeper?  What will happen to Oki?<br /><br />7.  Cinder's time in the hospital with the doctor.  I couldn't buy his motivations, they didn't seem too hurried to cure the lunar plague and after he finds out some super special stuff about Cinder, he doesn't do much to make sure she is protected.<br /><br />8.  Cinder and the Queen -- - - -- -SPOILER ----- Cinder finds out that Kai is going to marry the queen to seal a peace pact with the Lunars. Bsides the fact that this doesn't make a lotta sense from the Lunar side (they are so powerful, have better technology and are immune to the plague that has decimated the people of earth) Cinder finds out that the Queen intends to kill Kai after the wedding and then start a war (this also doesn't make sense, why not just start the war now?).  So Cinder goes to the ball in a borrowed dress and tries to warn Kai.  Her guardian and evil stepsister confront her, then the Queen tries to kill her, then Cinder tries to shoot the queen after kissing Kai then she runs out and her snap-on cyber foot falls off.  This was rushed and silly.  Kai found out what Cinder is and then she's locked up in his dungeon.  Pretty much the worst ending ever!<br /><br />Okay, so I'm not loving this book.

The second was about shells (lunars without powers). Then there was something about Galen.  Too many questions, not enough answers.  6.

I couldn't buy his motivations, they didn't seem too hurried to cure the lunar plague and after he finds out some super special stuff about Cinder, he doesn't do much to make sure she is protected.   8.  Cinder and the Queen -- - - -- -SPOILER ----- Cinder finds out that Kai is going to marry the queen to seal a peace pact with the Lunars. Bsides the fact that this doesn't make a lotta sense from the Lunar side (they are so powerful, have better technology and are immune to the plague that has decimated the people of earth) Cinder finds out that the Queen intends to kill Kai after the wedding and then start a war (this also doesn't make sense, why not just start the war now?).  So Cinder goes to the ball in a borrowed dress and tries to warn Kai.  Her guardian and evil stepsister confront her, then the Queen tries to kill her, then Cinder tries to shoot the queen after kissing Kai then she runs out and her snap-on cyber foot falls off.  This was rushed and silly.  Kai found out what Cinder is and then she's locked up in his dungeon.  Pretty much the worst ending ever!  Okay, so I'm not loving this book.

B005ARYEY6|4.0|Let it be known that I consider myself a huge fan of Miles Davis and his music.  When I saw how affordable this box set was, I had to purchase it.  Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />The box set contains three CDs and one DVD.  It also contains a booklet, but there is no designated space to store it in the box set.  This suggests laziness or a lack of forethought on behalf of the company that produced this set.  Buyers should be careful not to let the booklet fall out inadvertently.  Also I had considerable difficulty actually removing the CDs from the case.  I feared I might break the discs in half by mistake because they were so difficult to take out.<br /><br />As for the music itself, the band plays well on all three CDs.  But it is important to make two points about the music.<br /><br />1.  First of all, note that these songs were recorded in 1967 with Miles Davis's second great quintet featuring Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter.  Casual jazz fans should be advised that the sound of this quintet is quite different from that of his first great quintet with John Coltrane from the 1950s.  In other words, the playing styles are a bit more experimental (such as rapid tempos, less piano, etc.) and reflect Miles' moving away from traditional bebop.  If you're looking for an easy-listening sound like \\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"Milestones,\\" this box set is not it.  But if you're looking for a more aggressive sound like \\"ESP\\" or \\"Gingrebread Boy,\\" you will be pleased.<br /><br />2.  I strongly recommend that you check the track listing of the CDs before buying this set.  Even though there are three discs, there are several songs that are played multiple times.  \\"Round Midnight,\\" for example, is played at least three times.  \\"Masqualero\\" is played at least twice.  Serious jazz fans who like studying improvisation will probably be thrilled by this.  But casual jazz fans looking for a more diverse track selection might be disappointed.<br /><br />I have two verdicts on this box set.  Serious students of jazz or serial Miles lovers would likely be pleased by this box set.  There are some interesting arrangements of some of his most famous songs, and the solos are expressive.  However, because of the amount of song repetition, the casual jazz lover might be better off simply buying three individual Miles CDs.  At least that way, you could get a bit more variety regarding the song selection.<br /><br />(review edited on 2-23-12)Serious students of jazz or serial Miles lovers would likely be pleased by this box set.

B005KJZDXK|3.0|First off, I love Christmas music. I approached this album with an open and optimistic mind, having just become aware of the talents and charm of She & Him. The song selection is strong, Deschanel's voice is captivating, Ward's playing and singing are also pleasant, and most of the arrangements are very sweet. However, what keeps this project from becoming a classic in the Christmas canon is the production. It appears it was over-produced and engineered by amateurs using Playskool's \\"My First Music Studio\\" play set. The best songs here are simple arrangements, single instrument and Deschanel's voice riding on top such as \\"The Christmas Waltz\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\". A few of the songs had so many layers of sound they were distracting and Deschanel was buried deep in the mix, such as \\"Christmas Day\\". But perhaps the worst part was the extreme use of reverb. Why, oh why are they performing deep in a cavern? Typically the overuse of reverb in mixing, like too much Auto-Tune, is used by inexperienced producers to cover a less than pleasant voice. But this is a real insult to Deschanel, who has a charming, even intoxicating voice (unless all I've heard has been trickery, which I doubt). So who is the team of Audio Engineer interns who thought this would sound better if we digitally dropped She & Him in a cave? Bad Producer! No pizza for you.     I have always felt that Christmas music should be intended to make us feel the warmth of humanity, the comfort of close friends and family. Christmas recordings like this one should sound like these are old friends sitting in our living room sharing songs from their heart, not belching out of the mouth of a cold, dank cave. IF this project were remixed to put Deschanel not only in front of the band, but also in the room with us, it would become one of my top 20 Christmas albums of the last 50 years. As it is, I can't even listen to it.

Even the typos in the second book, which generally send me into spins of irritation didn't faze me.

B0056BMK6K|1.0|To all my fellow John Locke and Donovan Creed fans.<br /><br />I cannot believe we're talking about the same John Locke!  Tell me this is a wind up!  I was a fan until I  discovered that John Locke or Donovan Creed had deliberately inserted the words Michael J Fox and Parkinson's Disease in a blog, in a carefully thought through strategy to wind readers in, and then insert a link to sell more books. He seems proud to share with his fans how he came up with this fantastic marketing technique.<br /><br />Check it out for yourself, if it's still on his blog. It was there two days ago but have you noticed that anything that hints of criticism gets deleted overnight?  Three people have asked for an explanation.  Seems they're still waiting.<br /><br />If that wasn't bad enough how about his new on-line poll?  \\"Should I or should I not publish my book about the terrible things that happened to a young 15 year old girl who was imprisioned and tortured?\\"<br /><br />That is sick. The poll also seems to be rigged.  'NO' votes are not being registered so the outcome will give him the OK  to go into print. Guess what?  Tell him you love him and feed his ego and your posting WILL be printed.  Say something critical and you'll be deleted by the 'Moderator'. My fear is that when it's available, he'll post a sob story about a young Austrian girl who suffered for 25 years in a dungeon.  His ploy of using Michael J Fox is, I fear about to be repeated but with the approval of his fans!  He's been invited to promise he won't do that but as yet....no response.  Watch this space because that's what it will soon be.<br />John H
B005N0PJJO|5.0|My review from the first book stands from the first. I LOVE THESE BOOKS! I just started re-reading this one again, and I just finished it yesterday. It's got such sweet moments, and the risk taking between characters is so raw the writing consistently brought tears to my eyes. When was the last time you read an erotic novel where *that* happened? I read alot of romance, erotic and everything in between, and it rarely happens and surely doesn't happen  throughout a book. I was *in the moment* with the characters throughout. Despite the technical flaws with typos and one place in either book 1 or book 2 where the POV briefly changed by accident (2 sentences), this is one very well written book. And I am one of those picky grammatical people, but was so caught up in the characters and the story that interestingly enough, while the sex was hot, the relationship was what did it for me. I for the first time ever didn't care about the typos. Simply didn't care.<br /><br />Here is my review from Book 1.

Except, he added Miley Cyrus to The Last Song and killed that movie. Can not stand her! But anyway, off track. This is about this book and I loved it. I encourge everyone to read it, you will not be disappointed!
B0000046W9|4.0|Though most of the playing on the first three discs is exquisite and poised, I can partly sympathise with those jazz-fans who might find the music a little bland and middle-of-the-road.   However, CD Four is largely given over to Getz's 1963 session with guitarist Laurindo Almeida - and here the saxophonist is far more extrovert and forceful (without ever being inappropriately brutal, needless to say!) His deployment of a wider range of attack and tone-colour - and especially his vivid sequences of staccato notes - give his solos an exhilarating spontaneity, a kick and a bite that elsewhere is often lacking. Almeida's breaks, though not exactly jazz solos, offer beautifully chorded paraphrases of the themes (half of them his own compositions). Steve Kuhn is listed as the pianist on all seven tracks, but I hear him on only three: depending on how indulgent one feels, his contributions will sound either dreamily impressionistic, or inconsequential and unfocussed!   The other discs include the 1962-3 Getz LPs \\"Jazz Samba\\" (with Charlie Byrd), \\"Big Band Bossa Nova\\" (with Gary McFarland's band), \\"Jazz Samba Encore\\" (with Luiz Bonfa) and \\"Getz/Gilberto\\" (with Antonio Carlos Jobim, as well as both Joao and Astrud Gilberto). As long as one resists the temptation to treat it as background music, there is much to savour here: the gently undulating rhythms, the rich harmonies, the fine guitar work of Byrd and Bonfa, the seductively understated vocals from Astrud and Joao, the subtly infectious Brazilian percussion ... and of course Stan's (almost too) perfectly balanced solos.   The booklet explains that the supposed \\"live\\" album from 1964, \\"Getz Au Go Go \\" (with Astrud, and brilliant young Gary Burton on vibes), actually consisted of \\"studio material plus phony applause\\". For this CD set, only genuine live tracks (some previously unissued) are included - though even there a footnote states some of Astrud's vocals were added later!

0545003636|1.0|I was looking forward to listening to this book, and even though i kept on listening to the end, i am quite disappointed. The characters are flat, not well developed at all. Their actions are not motivated by anything else than just by having to move the plot along. Why the old man became a toy shop owner instead of who he really was was explained unconvincingly and superficially - i had the feeling this had happened only to make the story work, and not because of who he was or what had happened to him (i don't want to give away the story, so no specifics in this review). The basic metaphor of the book is the automaton, and clockwork mechanism - and that's exactly how this story works - but no real understanding of humans. They are not automatons, after all.

He's just had his fifth birthday and is learning that there is a world out there that he didn't know existed.<br /><br />This is one of the best books that I've read in a long time. Considering the amount of books I read weekly that is really saying something. The story felt so real and the characters really jumped out.<br />I felt the pains, joys and stresses of the two main characters.<br />The story is written from the viewpoint of the five year old and this keeps the story from being too dark, which I appreciated as a mother of a five year old boy.<br /><br />Some of the people in my book club complained about it not being realistic in a couple of places. I guess I didn't notice until it was pointed out. But even once I noticed it just didn't seem to matter. It IS fiction and the story moved so quickly, especially in the beginning, that I didn't pay much attention to the tiny details.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful book for book clubs, individuals and parents. It makes you appreciate the blessings in your life without being depressed.
B005MW8CPG|1.0|just when you thought metallikant couldn't possibly put out another product that sucked harder than 'load' - or was it 're-load'? or was it pretty much EVERYTHING post 'master o' puppets'? - they sunk to the occasion by employing an icon o' the amerikan underground (but who hasn't really produced anything o' value since looooong before 'load') to create something that ONLY hardened fan boys could rally behind and blog ad naseum about, how this album totally changed their diapers - 'like forever'!  no i didn't listen to album, just the samples found here, but my metal-sense is highly developed (i was bitten by a radioactive metalhead whilst quite young); and i can smell a p.o.s. even before it comes into contact with the air !!!  you know the corporations who eagerly grab all the money right out o' your pockets, and then laugh at you as you shuffle away with nothing left but lint?  that's these guys.  and now look, for those with absolutely NO concept o' money; major label 'impotent giganticus' has issued a deluxe edition, complete with $169 booklet - not BOOK, bookLET! - cause let's face it, the musik isn't worth the plastic it's imprinted on.  i guess they wanted the listener to have something to utterly take their frustrations out on and rip apart while enduring the first/last spin o' a cd only the deaf could thoroughly enjoy.  the BEST way to combat this sort o' pillage is by not giving 'em a cent!  beg, borrow, or steal, but do NOT pay for a product that makes the yugo look like a luxury auto by comparison  the lone star rating is 2 too many in this case  sincerely : grumpy old guy...

0897502027|5.0|If you own the original Tao of Jeet Kune Do, this is a nice update to the book. Though reading through one of the reviews, it didn't matter to them that the expanded edition has some additional information in the form of translations and some Forewards from family and friends, I actually like seeing things like that. A lot of people think that this book was actually published by Bruce Lee when he was alive, but it's actually a compilation of notes that he had when he was studying fighting systems and that Linda Lee allowed to be compiled and arranged to be published after his death.  If you don't own either edition, then this is a required book in any martial artists' library, regardless of what art you study.
B000EQ47GS|4.0|I have to agree with the one and only review who gave one star . This is probably the best album ever and it should have been treated that way . Just by the price alone i was wondering why is it so cheap . I would pay $100 for this cd if it was done right , The remaster is very dull . There was a rush to put out the first 2 cd's because of some bootlegs from Canada . That's a shame . They should have got someone like George Marino (king of mastering) cd's ! Hopefully there taking there time with Third Stage and re-thinking of maybe putting out 35 year special editions of the first 2 remastered the right way .

B004BSFSTA|5.0|I rarely write reviews for anything, but I'm so pleased and impressed with these headphones that I felt that I owe it to Marshall to do this.  First, let me say that I would consider myself a \\"power user\\" and an audiophile to some degree.  I am a multi-platinum credited audio engineer/producer, and over the last 18 years I've used more headphones than an average listener could imagine.  My Sony earbuds (that I loved) took a dump on me after two years of faithful service, and I was in the market for a comparable replacement set.  My friend told me that Marshall now makes headphones, so being a metal/rock guitar player I was naturally intrigued and wanted to try a pair of the earbuds.<br /><br />About a month back, I walked past an Urban Outfitters store in D.C. when I noticed a headphone listening station setup near the front of the store.  I went in and immediately noticed a pair of the Marshall Majors amongst the offerings available for a test run.  I put the cans (headphones) on, plugged my EVO 4G in, and fired up some LOUD music that I consider to be well recorded and mixed.  Needless to say, I was completely FLOORED by the POWER that these cans put out!  I'm not talking about loudness, I'm talking about POWER.  Like the same power emitted from cranked guitar amps that you try to capture in the recording studio.  This power is often referred to as \\"moving air\\", and these headphones definitely moved some air!  Since I was in the market for earbuds and not cans, I left the store without purchasing the phones... But I walked in circles around the block several times because I couldn't stop thinking about the sound of those headphones LOL.  So, I went back to the store after about an hour of contemplation and purchased these for $109 after tax.<br /><br />I've used the headphones quite heavily for the last month and I still get excited when thinking about hearing that first note after pushing play.  While I wouldn't necessarily call the bass response \\"tight\\", I wouldsay that the bass is gigantic and I don't know how Marshall was able to pull this off without muddying the low end frequency spectrum.  Although the bass response is very impressive for non-critical listening applications, it's really the extreme clarity of the mids and high end that make these headphones stand out from any others that I've ever heard.  I base this statement off of the fact that I'm hearing complete reverb tails and other studio effects that I've never noticed on music that I'm very familiar with.  Even stuff that I've been listening to for 20+ years is revealing new ear candy through these headphones every time I listen.  I'm actually considering mixing through them some... I've only listened to metal and rock through them so far, but the decision to do this will be when I finally decide to play some of the rap/hip-hop stuff I mixed through them.  The build quality so far seems to be of the highest caliber, and I expect these things to last a long time.<br /><br /> I'm relieved to know that Marshall, venturing outside of it's niche, still considers quality when releasing products bearing their excellent and legendary name.  Five stars, easily!<br /><br />UPDATE - Two years later, and I'm still rockin' the Marshalls daily!  No issues whatsoever.

B004CLYKLI|4.0|I would highly recommend this book for discussion, but I haven't seen the issue of religious background or motivation for excellence often discussed in reviews.  From my perspective, the questions of where the value of success comes from is the most interesting part of the book. Chua grew up nominally Catholic and her husband is Jewish, but she admits that faith-based heritage does not form the driving motivation for the expectations of success she places on her children. As a Christian myself, I often ask why it is that I want my children to succeed academically, in sports, music, or other pursuits. And I do want my children to succeed. I currently teach at an international Christian school, and one of the stereotypes our school constantly struggles against is the perception that Christian schools water down curriculum because they only really care about whether or not you love Jesus. As a parent, I wrestle with the question the book raises of, \\"Why do I desire my children to be successful?\\"  Chua addresses the issue of motivation for success as she observes her highly accomplished sister fight for her life in a battle with leukemia. Her sister despairs most about leaving behind her husband and young children. It made me consider how I allocate my own time, energy, and investment in the future. One of the failures I found in common both with Chua's philosophy and a common Christian approach is the belief that the present is irrelevant compared to the future. For Chua, this means any sacrifice now is worth the future reward of success. For the future-focused Christian, it means interest in the present is often abandoned because of a focus on eternity.   I have personally come to believe that the present and the future are not separate from each other; while delayed gratification can be a virtue, living with a focus that is disconnected from the present time ignores the current trials and suffering of those we are called to care for. As a parent, I hope my children will succeed because they desire to creatively and fully live out the gift of life they have been given. I share Chua's belief that children are born with tremendous potential and capability, and as parents we have a responsibility to help children discover and develop their gifts. But this process should be life-giving, not life-draining. The questions I found myself asking were, \\"Who is this family performing for? For whom are they laboring to develop their gifts and talents? In whose eyes do they desire to be deemed successful?\\" These are the questions I would be interested to see addressed.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This was the best of the Fast & Furious series. It bridges the gap between the \\"Fast & Furious\\" installment & \\"Tokyo Drift\\" installment. Great action & acting in this one. I'm hoping that they'll make another one that picks up after Tokyo Drift. Overall a great movie!

B0067JMJ8E|1.0|As a long time fan of Yes I tried to find something to like about this live album but sadly I could not.I think that We Can Fly is a truly fine effort but  this performance is quite embarrassing to say the least.When you are a super classic progressive rock group I guess you can release anything you want.This recording should not have seen the light of day.This current lineup is not up to the task to truly represent Yes live in concert.I will say it one more time this should have never been released.

1451648537|5.0|What an amazing biography! This book is filled with inspirational stories and quotes; it should be required reading for anyone in the tech leadership or management area.  Steve Jobs, although deeply flawed, was a visionary who without a doubt changed the world as we know it.  Readers of this book will learn both the good and bad practices of how to manage & grow a company, as well as the history of technology.  It is rare that a biography has the same \\"can't put it down\\" feel as this one, but I was hooked from the beginning.  I've been a Microsoft user my whole life, so this book in many ways opened a whole world to me.
B005HP2JAM|1.0|I was anxious to get this 3D Blu Ray disk, and put it in the ps3 to view. First, there were several ads to get through before reaching the Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Rather annoying, but just keep skipping them. The movie started, and I turned on the 3D... the picture was totally confusing, and not at all 3D. After trying several 3D re-starts, I put in another 3D movie (Cars 2), and verified that my system was fine. I put Cave back in, and was again confronted with non-watchable scenes. I closed one eye, and saw a certain scene, however, closing the other eye gave me an entirely different scene, not a slightly different view of the same scene.<br />I believe my disk is erroneously made. I can only hope mine is unique. I returned it to Amazon for a refund, and will wait to see other reviews before re-ordering.

1451648537|5.0|If Walter Isaacson doesn't win a Pulitzer for \\"Steve Jobs,\\" then something is rotten in Denmark.  This biography is as complete as it can be, considering the often prickly circumstances, and is a highly perceptive insight into the entire technogeek-cybernetics empire that has spawned across America over the last four decades.  It is truly one of the best books of any kind I have ever read!
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins captures every detail about the ongoing feud between religion and reality. It's interesting honestly. I offer many of my religious friends for them to read it. Almost none of them want to read it. It confused me at first, but now I realize it's because they look at it as \\"evil\\". It's not a book to them. They think it's a stretch of logic. Sadly, the religious people I am speaking of are the ones who have the stretched logic, whereas Dawkins sets the tone for our future. If religious people would free their mind of the illogical restraints that religion puts on them and read this with a minimal amount of optimism, or at least the absence of pessimism, the numbers of rationalists would skyrocket. I only don't use atheists because of the mistaken connotations that it has unfortunately developed from our religious counterparts.  Overall, this book is well written and brings many arguments to the table. Some for religion and some against. But in saying that, Dawkins skillfully counters the religious arguments with logic and evidence. He uses everything available to him to present reality on a well-placed display for all to observe the truth to be found. My hat off to Dawkins and I truly respect his attempts to invite people to rationalize about the beautiful place we live in. This book is a trophy of his establishment as one of the leading rationalist and humanist that is pushing and breaking the barrier that religion as placed long ago.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Has never failed to wake me up! Tons of options, too! OUTSTANDING alarm clock! Got it for free, but totally worth buying. Easily the best thing I've gotten from the app of the day. My favorite features are the ability to limit snoozes, and being able to require math problems before it will shut off. I'm a high school math teacher, but even addition can be surprisingly hard when you're mostly asleep. By the time I can figure the problems out, I'm awake! Great!

B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I loved this version of Jane Eyre, and I went in to it fully expecting not to.  I disagree with those who said Jane didn't spend enough time with Mr. Rochester to fall in love with him - I was in love with him inside of 10 minutes.    I thought both Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were excellent in their respective roles, the scenery was gorgeous, and it was pretty much perfect.   This is just one interpretation of the story.  There are other versions of Jane Eyre that are as good or perhaps better than this one, but that doesn't make this version anything less than excellent in its own right.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Great sleeper flick!  I Really wasnt expecting it to be that good cant wait for part two!  Really great acting also from some fairly unknowns.
1857885082|5.0|I am English and moved to America in 1994; if this book had been around then I would have saved myself a lot of offended silences and quizzical looks.  Or is that quizzical silences and offended looks?  For instance, Kate explains to me exactly why telling people that 'I'm going to sell my kids back to the gypsies' doesn't go down very well over here, and why my American family think I'm mad or very unhappy when I play down how my house/car/clothes/job/hair looks.  When I enter into a little enjoyable moaning, Kate tells me why it's not enjoyable for those around me.  Now I'd like her to write a book about Americans; if I have any quibbles it's that she sometimes says Americans don't do something 'English' when I know they do, all the time (viz. home improvement).  But generally, Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ms. Fox.  Even my mother-in-law, whose parents were off-the-boat English, has learned where her own self-effacing and moderate nature has come from, and made me give her copy back!  I had to buy my own!  Typical!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Crazy Stupid Love is a great movie about finding true love in the midst of life's struggles. The ending will completely surprise you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was interesting enough to keep me up late at night reading.    Wanted more of  Katniss and Gale's romantic link....got so little of it.  Hyamitch background....a few flashbacks to his time in the arena would have been nice  Arena fighting details....little more gore  Maybe these things will come out in book two.......
1576875776|4.0|I absolutely love Vivian Maier's photographs. Unfortunately the book is printed very poorly by Asia Pacific Offset in China chosen by powerHouse Book. The halftoning pattern interacts with the original grain of the print or negative to create an ugly effect. The sepia toning is overdone and nauseating. But the biggest problem has to do with the depth of blacks and shadows. I measured the deepest black in most images at a density of 1.6, which isn't really black, more like coffee with cream. What a pitty.<br /><br />EDIT: increased rating in light of the discussion associated with this review and to take into account the price of the book. The quality is ok for a $26 book but is obviously not the quality found in a $100 book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game but the fact it still hasn't been updated yet is ridiculous. Last time I buy a game from here.
0061367036|2.0|Although this book had the potential to be a very interesting guide to all the monsters faced on Supernatural, the author rather squandered this potential through choosing to include a list of monsters that was largely arbitrary and only loosely related to the show itself, although all the legends did make for some interesting reading.  What was painfully bad about this whole thing, though, was the writing itself.  The book attempts a first-person plural perspective, which I had never seen before in a published work and for very good reason: it is impossible to tell who is speaking and when and where, and creates a sort of bizarre mental image of the two main characters standing hypnotized and chanting out the narration in unison, except when one or the other takes a break to talk in the third person.  The writing was so distractingly bad that I can't even say for sure how good the completion of the book was, because I couldn't even follow what it was saying enough to make it all the way through.
0786860707|5.0|Great book. The book came in excellent condition and was on time. It was very affordable. WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME WRITE MORE THAN THIS!??!??!?!

B005DR64SC|1.0|There is a reason this movie may end up being the biggest flop EVER.  A movie needs to be somewhat believable.  NOT THIS ONE  A movie needs chemistry between actors . NOT THIS ONE  A Movie needs to be fresh. NOT THIS ONE - too many of this type already.  It is sad Nichole Kidman was in this movie. It will probably hurt her marketability value for some time.   Cages value should not be worth much anyway. He has nothing fresh to offer any way, just the old dragging pause move he makes in the movies  How did this cost 35 million to make? It was in a house to most of the time.!!!  The cost on this dvd is probably high since only a few people will probably buy it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app would cost 24.99 without ads. I do not mind the ads at all and it saved me $25.  Search for words, tap on any word to look it up, listen to the pronunciation,  adjust text size.  Well done, Merriam -Webster. Did I mention this is free?

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard was kidnapped at the age of 11 and spent the next eighteen years with her kidnapper and his wife, both of whom had multiple psychological issues.  Considering their problems and the time she was forced to stay with them, it's a miracle that Ms Dugard didn't end up with more issues than she reports in her book.  I find this book incredible and harrowing for several reasons.  First, Ms Dugard wrote it herself - very likely with some assistance from a professional editor, but the fact that she wrote it at all, with or without help, is amazing considering what she went through.  Second, her descriptions of Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy don't pull any punches.  She doesn't describe the worst of what happened to her (with the exceptions of the rapes), but her hatred of these two individuals is extremely clear, despite her claims of forgiveness to the Garrdios - even though she has to pretend to get along with them and to be happy in order to survive.  Third, and most amazing from my point of view, is the fact that she read the audio version of this book in its entirety.  It's incredible enough that she wrote this book, but I'm sure her therapist, friends, and family all stood by and stayed with her while she did it.  But to read it out loud after she wrote it, to an audience of total strangers?  I'm amazed she was able to do that.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if she didn't break down at several points along the way while she was telling this story.  In fact, I'm sure she did - but you can't tell from the recording.  Finally, to anyone who criticizes the book for its writing style, or the audiobook for the way it's narrated, you need to remember that Jaycee Dugard is not a professional writer, reader, or actor.  She's just an ordinary woman who was caught up in horrific circumstances and lived to tell the tale.  That she was able to tell it at all - both on paper and on audio - speaks volumes for her courage and her intelligence, and I salute her fordoing it.  She's made it clear, now that she's told her story, that all she wants is privacy for her, her daughters, and her extended family.  I sincerely hope that she gets her wish.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Tried others, uninstalled everything else.  It has a clean interface and it is very easy to use.  I recommended this app to my friends.
B005SJIP2S|3.0|This show is a good representation of my experience with Yes in 2009 (on tour with Asia in the US). Some truly cringe-worthy moments, some passages that compete with classic Yes concert recordings from days gone by, and a slower pace throughout (which occasionally becomes plodding, like during \\"Tempus Fugit\\"). Steve Howe is in top form here as usual, but the rest of the band is hit or miss throughout. Benoit is not Jon Anderson... which is both bad and good (he's inferior to the Jon of 1973, or even 2003, but much better than the weakened Jon of today would be in the band).<br /><br />Completists will want this, but more casual fans would do well to wait for a recording from the 2011 band -- which would feature a much tighter band and include some of the excellent material from \\"Fly From Here.\\"
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I love this movie and lost my previous copy so I ordered this one. Unfortunately, this version does not have all of the special features that my previous copy had, so that was kind of sad. Even so, it was wonderful to be able to watch it again. Although I only paid for regular shipping, the movie arrived within two days. Highly recommended.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Having been a fan of this movie. When I purchased the blu ray i watched it with my brother and he also admitted it was like watching it for the first time all over again. I liked the remastered version.. Im not sure what other flaws it has but the picture was very clear.
0553801473|4.0|*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***<br /><br />As much as I love this series, there are a few things that I have realised too late. Nothing ever happens. George will lead you through thousands of words and build up on an event, and after investing all this time in reading about it, he then proceeds to have that said event made redundant. For example, in previous books; you will read about the \\"King-Beyond-the-Wall\\" and how kick-arse he is, and about his efforts to build an immense unstoppable army, and about the various clans (in pain-staking detail) and the politics within those clans, and about his efforts to obtain a magical horn to knock down the wall, and his life previous and hopes and dreams of the wildlings, and about his unborn child - and you will read about the intensely detailed ranger missions to gather intelligence on the wildings and you will read about what is seen - the creatures, the clans, the weather, the terrain etc etc etc etc etc... This goes on forever, so, the reader is expecting some big event and huge climax (as one would expect), but, no... What we get is the wildings finally attacking and then in about five sentences it is destroyed by another king who was on the other side of Westeros. The way this whole thread was just cut off and disbanded was infuriating. This is what I mean by NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. This happens ALL the time.<br /><br />I mean, we read about Snow and his painful climb to the head of the Night Watch. This carries on forever and the reader is guessing that George is setting up some awesome reason that Jon Snow has become the leader of the Night Watch and we are excited because we believe he will lead the army of the Night Watch to save his sister etc etc, but, no... After investing a million hours reading about this, the Night Watch stab Jon Snow a billion times at the end of the book. The end. You know nothing Jon Snow.<br /><br />The whole thing with the Red Wedding really pissed me off. I mean, I read books worth about this fool gallivanting about dodging armies, fighting armies; capturing people etc etc and then WHAM! - He's dead. Again there was nothing achieved and nothing really happened. Nothing ever happens in this series.<br /><br />Even in this latest book, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Also, in this current book I am supposed to be talking about, why did I need to read a small book's worth about the Imp riding down a river on an old boat?<br /><br />Why has Cersi now had her wings clipped? I need someone to hate.<br /><br />Another thing that is kinda creeping me out is George's great detail on various character's penises, or \\"c*nts\\". Now, I really don't think this is nesessary in a fantasy novel, or, really any novel. George seems to be trying to make his books ultra-realistic, but, most of us would read fantasies to get away from real life - no?<br /><br />That said, for some reason, I really do love reading these books and that is why I am giving this book 4-stars. It may be the beautiful language used to describe the world, or, the intriguing character build up and their many layers of grey. It might just be the journey of the various characters. I am not sure, but, I if you can stomach a massive read, I would still recommend this over most other fantasy series.
B0063ESZ9K|4.0|When used with the included leather strap, the bottom has side snaps that loop around the two strap lugs and hold the camera just fine.  It is very nicely finished both inside and out and will prevent scratches to your X10.  The top uses a hidden magnet to allow very quick access to the camera.  The color is a nice match with the glossy black fX10 finish.  I have used the Fuji X100 case (which is identical) and it has held up very well and shows no sign of failure.  I gave it four stars due to the price but that seems to be a common downside to all Fuji accessories.<br /><br />Update Dec 16 2011;<br /><br />I still find the design very appropriate for the X10.  The quick detach allows you to access the battery and memory card very quickly.  I do not believe a case that attaches through the tripod mount would be any good.  In use, the design is very good.  I do not use neck straps but a wrist strap and have had no problems with the case coming off on its own.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I love Michael Buble and usually really like Shania Twain but their duet is horrible in my opinion. Mainly because Shania sounds really bad.

B0034KZE9U|5.0|After six years working in kitchens, I've gone through a few different pairs of shoes. My first four years, I went through four pairs of shoes. And paying $60-80 for a pair of shoes every six months is ridiculous.  These shoes have lasted longer than any other (two years and no sign of any deterioration at all) and were cheaper than any other. They are comfortable, durable, and non-slip. Several coworkers have them as well and no complaints. Strongly recommended.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Cute, increasingly challenging game, but it needs to support tablets. Display is all out of whack on Tab 10.1 making the game unplayable.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I just bought the Blu Ray of Aliens and thought I would give a quick review. Let me just say this. Without a doubt, this is one of the best Blu Ray Releases Ever! The quality of the transfer is amazing! My eyes where glued to the screen the entire 2 hours and 37 minutes..I noticed things in this movie that I had ever even noticed before in the DVD Versions. Specifically when they are inside the complex. Of course the space scences are mind blowing as well. This just goes to show that when the studio takes the time to totally remaster and do the transfer right, the results are stunning! I wish other older movies would get this kind of treatment!<br /><br />As far as special features there really are none, so I will just keep my Bonus Disc from the 2 Disc DVD Version.<br /><br />Of course if you buy the entire anthology blu ray you will get all the special features, but for me, ALIENS is really the only movie I care about of the 4 that where released. So this release was a perfect buy for me. I got it on sale at Target for only $9.99!
0553801473|1.0|Two months ago I was a huge fan of the Game of the Thrones series.  I read the first three books after the first season of the show, once I found out it was based of this series of books.  I absolutely loved them.  They kept my interests the twist were fun and refreshing.  It was great!  Then I got to the 4th book.  So bored I barely finished it. Then I started this book a month ago... I think I am somewhere around page 300ish?  And I won't finish it (note: my husband just finished it so I made him tell me what happened, and quite honestly I don't want to waste my time). 5 years from now when the next book comes out I might finish this one... but somehow the author would have to make me care what happens next, which I don't right now.  I read another review about these last two books being characters wandering the world doing things that are setting up for future books, but what is lacking in these books are the set ups are not interesting and look like they are going no-where. They certainly don't make me want to keep reading.  And I have had enough of chapter's ending where it looks like a character is dead and 5 chapters later they are fine.  Can we please think of a new game Mr. Martin?  Oh and Cat is brought back from the dead and is only in one chapter of this book and then forgotten.  Why did you bring her back if that was all you are going to do?  If she is going to show up in a later book....seriously?  Then you should have cut out all the new character's you brought in the last two books and focused on the characters people want to read about. Writing just to write is the same thing as someone talking to hear themselves talk.  Most people don't care what you are saying at that point.  I am very disappointed in these last two books.  I heard that this was originally supposed to be a trilogy; it probably should have stayed that way.  I would really like to get my money back for these last two books.

0307943194|1.0|The story is based in the Chicago area. Yet the reader mispronounces LaSalle when identifying LaSalle Street. Even worse he pronounces Des Plaines (locally pronounced DEZ PLANEZ) he calls it de plan UNFORGIVABLE. I have lived in Chicago my entire life and only outsiders mispronounce Des Plaines.  The story is dull boring and far from an the usual Grisham edge of the seat legal thriller ..SKIP IT.

0671646788|5.0|In the magic of thinking big David j. Schwartz relates various personal experiences along with other accounts of people who think big and people who don't. He explains how thinking big and staying positive in every aspect of life is the most important thing you can do. He iterates on how keeping a positive attitude will make some significant changes in your life as well as supplying methods of curing your fears and building confidence. If you've ever asked yourself why your not where you want to be in any aspect of your life this book may provide the answers to that question.  My mentor handed down this book to me and it changed my life. I was a shy, virtually friendless, highschooler but after embracing the teachings of this book that took a full 180 I now have just about everything I want out of life and more friends I can count and the confidence to show for it. Thinking big made me the happiest guy I know I believe it can for you to.

B001KPYNR0|5.0|Enya is my favorite contemporary recording artist, so I have every Enya album released in the U.S. I bought \\"And Winter Came\\" as soon as it was available as an MP3 download at Amazon. The album consists of 13 tracks - eleven English songs, which are all original compositions, plus \\"O&iacute;che Chi&uacute;in\\" being sung in Irish and \\"Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel\\" in English and Latin. The songs have mostly a Christmas or wintertime theme. It's another great album that even casual fans of Enya should have. I loved every track, but if I had to choose one song that stands out the most, it would have to be \\"Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel\\" with its haunting sound.<br /><br />\\"And Winter Came\\" is a definite must-have album for Enya fans.
B005HS00XW|1.0|I am a long time peter fan. I was at the Selling england, Lamb shows.I saw his first three solo tours. I was really tempted to see him again but tickets were very expensive. I looked up the setlist and said Ill wait for the dvd.I enjoyed Growing up  and Secret World is one of my favorites.As for this... its slow. The orchestra really adds nothing to peters songs. Peter physically does not look well.If you were making a best of video,very little of this would be on it.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|Everyone has been raving about this movie. I loved the book, but hated this movie. It was so drawn out and way too boring. I simply cannot believe that it had such good critic reviews. Watch older versions which are much  better...
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I went into this film with very low expectations. Probably, that was better.   It was much a corny western full of stereotypes and cliché Western scenes something I am sure the scene writers intended. They put it together well, and the aliens with their planes and rockets made it intriguing. They made interesting alien characters and gave us a plot that kept you interested throughout.  The acting was very good, not surprising as both the two main characters Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are fine  actors, both played well. The characters were developed well.   I think the filming was good, not brilliant. The locations were filmed well and the special effects were good but again not brilliant.   As such I enjoyed it.   Would I recommend it, yes!
B004EPZ070|5.0|This movie was much better than expected. In fact, it was a very touching movie. What is shown is that if you like someone, you have to let them know. Kate Hudson plays the perfect self-absorbed female who pushes her weight around; Gennifer Goodwin learns in the end that she has to stand up for herself and take a stand. Probably considered a chick flick, but I enjoyed it!
B005SJIP2S|4.0|Either you like the post Anderson Yes or not. Oliver finally shines on the last track, Starship Trooper, and there were times I was listening that I forgot it wasn't Jon. Yes, I counted two vocal flubs. Chris doesn't seem to be as snappy on Tempus Fugit than the original. But we have it live, right?<br /><br />Nice to have a well recorded version of the tour, but at one of the shows I was at Howe did some very creative things with the acoustic intro to Roundabout that I wish he had played this night.<br /><br />The umpteenth live versions of standards we could do without, but we do get four new tracks live, and a presentation of this lineup which toured for several years. I do like it, and like Fly from Here more and more as I hear new little parts.<br /><br />New Yes. It is the new reality. Everyone else has changed, even Jon once before, and Chris too if you count ABWH.
1400069181|4.0|Having studied organizational leadership and having worked in marketing, I found that this book didn't really teach me anything about leadership theory, trust, teamwork, or working with people that I hadn't already been exposed to in life or in my studies. That said, having read a ton of leadership themed books, this one was quick and passionate. The enthusiasm Blake has about making a difference and inspiring others to do so is really infectious. Reading it reignited some of my passion and reminded me that even the simplest idea can grow into something that can have an enormous impact.
0385535139|4.0|I enjoyed this book much more than some of John Grisham's past few books.  If you are a fan of his, you'll like it.  Why do some people feel the need to go on and on and on about it? I look at the reviews to see if the book was enjoyed or really not so much.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I got this case yesterday and am very happy with it. I wanted something thin but would give my Kindle some protection from bumps and protect the screen when it's in my purse.It's very light weight but nicely designed. It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't add weight or take up valuable purse space.  Some reviewers have said that they can't get theirs to stand up in the horizontal position but I had no problem at all.   Best part is that it dropped in price from the time I pre ordered it and the time it was delivered! I was charged the lower price withhout having to contact Amazon. Thanks Amazon!  About the easel: look at the picture views in the product description to get a better idea of how to use it. The instructions that come with the case are just drawings and not very good ones at that. If you look at all the pictures you'll understand that the strap has to go under the bottom to keep it secure and not accidently fold up.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The best note taking app I've ever had. This is a yes if you are looking for something to take notes on in class, or you just want to write down some recipes. Get it.
0385534639|4.0|I agree with those reviewers who applaud this book.  I like to reserve 5-star ratings for the creme de la creme - \\"Night Circus\\" falls barely short of that classification, in my opinion.  But it is entirely enchanting if the reader is willing to suspend disbelief in the supernatural.  Beautifully structured, and full of lush imagery and thoroughly-imagined sets, the book tells the story of two young magicians whose love must hurdle impossibly large and mysterious obstacles.  The story is primarily about the ability of true love to prevail against all odds, I believe.  That's a well-worn theme, but in this case it is presented against a unique backdrop, without sentimentality or cliche.  I found the use of present tense in the narration to be a bit distracting, but perhaps that technique improved the pacing more than I realize. All in all, the novel was entertaining and memorable.  I look forward to Erin Morgenstern's next endeavour.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I love the game! good quality, great gameplay and its quite easy but after 1 run through it gets boring.. no updates
B000MP0XIW|3.0|The bionic sound is missing on season one....no bueno....still pretty good but loses some of the fun, hopefully season 2 has it
B0058VW36U|4.0|Great game but I go through the levels pretty fast and it needs to be updated Amazon. Seriously Amazon needs work on updating a lot of their apps.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Glad I watched it on DVD because I needed to pause and rewind a lot of stuff at the beginning, it was complex. But I like that in a movie, it makes you think and keeps you guessing. The story is clever and unusual. The special fx are excellent. The sub-story about Cobb and his wife is suspenseful. This is a satisfying movie.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Can't download due to no Wi-fi but it won't clear off my Notification bar!!! I have re-booted, hard-booted, everything. VERY frustrating ...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Don't play this if you have work to do or errands to run. You'll be too engrossed in this game to do anything productive.
1594744769|4.0|This was pretty good, not what I expected, but interesting and I liked the main characters.  I knew by the tone that we were starting in the regular world and the main character would experience things which meant no turning back -- that was fun.
0452289963|5.0|This book was so wonderful.  I have the audio version and plan to listen to it several more times.  I've been a fan of Dr. Wayne Dyer for many years and have listened to his audiobooks over and over again.  The one thing I was so happy about after listening to Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth is that they have the same basic message.<br /><br />Listening to this book gave me new insight to what Dr. Dyer teaches and when I went back to listen to some of Dr. Dyer's stuff again, Eckhart's book gave me new insight into that too.<br /><br />The best part was that I found Oprah's Spirit Channel podcast on iTunes and the first 10 or so episodes was all about this book and she had Eckhart right there to answer questions and talk about each chapter one at a time.  It really helped things sink in for me.<br /><br />I really began to understand with this book that my happiness comes from within me and through the connection that I have to everything and everyone else.  I've realized how important it is to stop and \\"smell the roses\\" so to speak or sit and observe without judgment.  It revitalizes my spirit and makes me feel more at peace and more connected.  I am also in the process of accepting the fact that all of this \\"stuff\\" that I worry about with my outward appearance and what other people think of me means a whole lot of nothing!  It's a difficult transition to make sometimes, but something I'm getting better with.<br /><br />I plan to listen to The Power of Now after I get done with this other book I'm reading :)  Thank you Eckhart for your fresh perspective!
1400052181|5.0|This was a very good purchase. Interesting book. It was delivered to me in a timely fashion as I needed it to write a paper for school. Overall greatttt
B005HSG3TC|5.0|good cover for your kindle easy to hold duable the soft cover is nice so you can fold it like a book cover for the book feel
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's is so good. Never saw the first season but now so glad I did.  Great show, wish it never ends.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love all the angry bird games for my EVO. Notice it has problems on my son's lg optimus though since the gingerbread update.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|If you have any inkling to see Adele live, watch this DVD. It will invoke chills as you crank your home stereo to unheard of decibels and adjust your high definition quality television. It will absolutely, positively BLOW YOUR MIND. Adele is truly an inspiration and wonder. Every time I watch her sing, it is proof that some people are born to something with their life... hers of course is singing. Standing ovation, 5 stars, two thumbs up, and everything in between... this video will leave you breathless. Enjoy!
0385344325|1.0|This is the first Jack Reacher/Lee Child book I have read and I don't think I will be reading any others.  The plot was interesting enough but the writing was so monotonous.  There was way too much description - do I really need to know every detail of a bus ride from Virginia to Mississippi - it wasn't important to the story and it simply wasn't interesting.  The author is much too verbose \\"she looked me over from top to bottom, head to toe, beginning to end....\\", really?  Also, the one sentence \\"I said nothing\\" had to be in the book at least 100 times.  Not sure if that is a \\"Jack Reacher thing\\" or not.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is a must read. I have a limited amount of books that I keep and this is one of them. I love the strong female lead and the strange yet beautiful world that Cashor has created. This was a fantacy story but it was so nice to read something that isn't about vampires or witches!
1419702238|5.0|This book is very good.  I like this book very much.  I have read this book more than once and all i can say it is worth buying.
B001QWBM62|5.0|To really improve the quality of your movies, quality sound is key. The Zoom H4N solved all my sound problems. I paired it with a shotgun mic on a boom pole, and now get good quality dialogue recording on my film projects. I realize I have barely scratched the surface of what I can do with this piece of equipment, but I all ready know I love it!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I almost did not purchase this item after reading so many terrible reviews, but glad I took the chance as this makes my Kindle Fire just that much better.  The cover fits like a smartphone body glove case with a cover, it's very snug, high quality build and the \\"stand\\" capability is icing on the cake so to speak.  The cover actually improves the look and feel of the Kindle Fire while protecting it as well -AND- it doubles as a stand to watch video etc.  I am a very satisfied customer (5 stars)
1932907009|3.0|The fact that the author wrote 2 sequels to this book proves that even he didn't really believe that this was the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need. I'm not as ardent a follower of this system as some people are, but there is a lot of good info here. Some of his rules are a bit too carved in stone for me, and I don't like the way he implies that if you don't follow them you will fail. He rags on some pretty good movies, like 'Memento', for not following his rules, and justifies it by saying that they didn't make much money compared to the ones he praises. I don't care for the fact that he calls his rules \\"immutable laws\\" and it bothers me that his whole approach, and the justification of his system, and of his criticism of other films, is about money. Yes, movies are a business, yes we all want to make money, but it gets old to me when that becomes your primary driving force, and the test of a movie's quality. Still, as I said, there's a lot of useful/helpful information in here. Ignore the 'immutable' part and his rules make some fine 'guidelines.' The beat-sheet he lays out has helped me plot out two difficult screenplays quickly, and any of his system's points can be very helpful when you run into trouble. Still, I guess the part I dislike is that at times the author comes across to me as kind of arrogant, especially for the guy who wrote 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot.'<br />As a last note, this book does include some wonderful advise and help for actually selling your screenplay. This wasn't of much help to me as writer/director because I write to make the film myself no to sell to someone else, but if that is what you're looking to do, this is the most helpful book on that subject that I've read so far.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Beautiful and moving. No one can watch it without shedding a tear. It is the single most important film to have been made.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|It's actually real fun and easy to use... and u never know who you are gonna meet or chat to. :)
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is...truly, unrepentantly, brilliant. I was so moved when I first saw this in theaters that I didn't think I could ever watch it again the motion was so strong. But I did, purchased the dvd right away, and might I say, again, truly, unrepentantly BRILLIANT !
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Before I saw this I read some of the fanboy reviews and it seems to me that a lot of them take monster movies waaaay too seriously.<br />  This was a good monster movie.<br />Its not Shakespeare. Its not Gone With the Wind. Its a monster movie.<br />  The number one complaint seems to be the new effects are mostly CGI. Is this a problem?<br />There was no CGI in 1982 when the first one was made or they would have used it.<br />  The 1982 version and the new one are like the difference between Alien and Aliens. The 1982 version was spooky, claustrophobic<br />and slimy ( I mean that in a good way). The new one is louder and more action packed with a lot more truly spectacular creature effects.<br />  One thing I noticed in both movies was that they only had one radio<br />which never worked but everybody had a flamethrower.
1451627289|2.0|I have just completed reading this, my first King novel. I've not read any of Mr. Kings other books or short stories, primarily because I have had little interest in his type of genre. What changed my mind with regard to 11/22/63 was that the time travel premise interested me, I've been a JFK admirer for many years, and after watching several interviews with Mr. King, he implied that he had spent a great deal of time researching the \\"what ifs\\" of a post 11/22/63 ongoing Kennedy administration. I had great expectations for this book based on what I had heard from Mr. King and of course his reputation.  My expectations were not rewarded. The story begins with a fascinating premise, supports the primary characters with an intriguing initial story line, then slowly falls apart through the second half of the book. By the end of the novel, I put the book down and had to ask the question that any reader should ask an author... was the book worth my time? I thought that my time had ultimately been wasted.   The book is over-long. The promising plot dissolves into a criminologist overview of the Oswald character that can't quite make that man seem real to me the reader. As Oswald develops as a key figure in the novel, the book  becomes labored and depressing, so much so that by the middle of the book, I wanted the story to move to a conclusion which seemed nowhere in sight.   Several key characters appear, then disappear without adding any significant purpose to the story line. I can only suspect that they were added as \\"fillers\\" to extend the book length. The ending by the very nature of the premise insured predictability that King then tried to modify with weak results. The book 's last 150 pages ultimately seemed as though Mr. King had lost interest in this project and wanted to opt-out as conveniently as possible. When finished, I put the book down and wondered...\\"is that all there is?\\" I felt cheated and duped.
B000000OQF|5.0|When you hear something special you know it. When you see something you know it. This is the single best debut album in the history of rock. There is no comparison when it comes to something that is an absolute success. The album came out in '87 but was not an overnight sensation as a number of records are. This one didn't explode for nearly a year and explode it did.<br /><br /> Welcome to the Jungle, My Michelle, Nighttrain, It's So Easy, Mr. Browstone, Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O Mine, Paradise City the list goes on of amazing hard hitting rock n roll. This is a true must have record and if you are young and want to hear what a truly amazing album is this is it. Down, dirty and hard! Nothing compares to this in terms of what hard rock truly is and is a masterpiece.
0545123275|3.0|I agree with some reviewers that at first it seems that there was way too much obsession with the wolves and Grace but it all came together throughout the story.  There was a lot of fluff and romance for all the young ones who want to read a book with a lot of love and romance.  There is a small amount of action.  I did enjoy the story of Grace and watching her character growth as she got to know Sam.  I thought his character was fantastic.  I didn't enjoy all the romance and fluff.  I thought some of it was okay but there's a point when one wants to also read some action and danger.  This is why I only gave the story 3 stars.  The way the author ended this story though was one that had me wanting to know what was going to happen.  It was kind of a what??? ending so I have a feeling I will be reading Linger next.  The writing style was very good and I enjoyed the way the characters were written and the depth to each one and how each character had a unique personality.  Just know if you are going to read this expect a lot of romance and little else.  3.5 Stars!
B000N39HOE|4.0|This record does not need any further review, from the artistic perspective. It's simply one of the best analog recordings ever made, period!<br />My comments are about the way Amazon LLC shipped this item to me:<br />- a ridiculous plastic bag, that does not protected the content inside it: 3 CDs and 1 DVD...!<br />I really can not understand how Amazon can ship an item like this, without wrapping the box-set on a boardcard box in order to protect the discs that have a poor paper cover. It's a shame IMHO...<br />I hope that on my next orders, the people on Amazon's warehouse uses a cardboard box to avoid the situation I just faced: the discs arrived loose inside their box-set, two of four trays were broken, and the cover is damaged due the transportation.<br />Please Amazon, think about this...
B00004RFFS|4.0|\\"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles\\" is a horror drama film, based on the interview confessions of Louis de Pointe du Lac, played by Brad Pitt. The narrative essentially follows Louis and Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) and their partnership as vampires. Lestat is the senior of the two and Louis is his protégé. Louis' journey begins in Louisiana, then to France, and he travels much of the world before returning to America. Louis and Lestat have a challenging friendship, as Louis is at first a reluctant vampire, and this leads to many confrontations between the two of them. The narrative is spread over 200-years, which provides for some interesting transformations in terms of Louis and Lestat's philosophies as vampires. Pitt and Cruise both display credible horror genre acting skills.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Alright, so on the Kindle fire, I couldn't figure out how to connect using the internet, connecting via lan was easy.  To connect to the internet, as they said, once you've opened the app (but not connected yet), click on the _kindle_ menu at the bottom, then click on the little page icon in that menu, that will get you to the internet discovery screen, then just sign in to gmail and you're done on the kindle side. Just sign in to gmail with the streamer on your pc side too and you'll see it now!  Easy to do, but was frustrating trying to find the settings because I didn't realize it was integrated into the kindle menu...  Anyways, thanks for the help guys, once you're in, this program is actually pretty amazing. Not flawless, but useful and it really gets your inner geek going to be doing it. :)
B000H5TVJY|4.0|This is a good movie.  The quality is superb and it is totally worth watching.  If you are looking for clarity picture, just buy it!
