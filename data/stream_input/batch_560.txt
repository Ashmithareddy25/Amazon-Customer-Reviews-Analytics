B00003CXXJ|5.0|Dreamworks Pictures' wonderful, whimsical Shrek proves to be the latest family film to live up to its billing. With its blend of high adventure, light romance, and double-layered dialogue (which will take on a slightly different meaning for the under- and over-12 crowd), Shrek is capable of enthralling both children and their parents. In fact, this movie is so good that adults unaccompanied by offspring can venture into a theater without having to dress up in a disguise. Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.<br /><br />When it comes to computer-generated motion pictures, Shrek has once more raised the bar - and this one was already at an impressively high level in the wake of Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Yet Shrek outshines them both, boasting the most impressive detail and most amazingly rendered creatures of any motion picture in its class. And, although the human beings still don't look entirely realistic, they're getting close. In fact, this is the first major computer animated film in which human beings have had a significant role (they played secondary parts in the two Toy Storys), and their appearance is such that we have no more trouble accepting them than we do in traditional animated fare.<br /><br />Shrek is essentially Beauty and the Beast with a few clever twists. In the quirky, irreverent way that it views fairy tales and their conventions, it's not unlike The Princess Bride. Fans of those two stories will find much to like here. And, both kids and adults can play a game of \\"guess how many famous faces we can see\\". There are certainly a large number of cameos: Pinnochio (a \\"possessed toy\\"), Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, the Gingerbread Man, the Three Blind Mice, the Mirror (as in \\"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all...\\"), and many others.<br /><br />Our protagonist is an ogre named Shrek (voice of Mike Myers, using a Scottish accent). Except for scaring off the odd knight who comes in search of his hide-out, Shrek leads a relatively peaceful life, until the day that he stumbles into Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy). Donkey is fleeing soldiers who are rounding up all the fairy tale creatures with the intent of resettling them. Unfortunately for Shrek, the local landholder, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), has decided to deport them to Shrek's swamp. This causes the irritated ogre, accompanied by his new best friend, Donkey, to head for the city of Duloc, where Farquaad holds court. There, he makes a deal with the noble - in return for getting back his swamp, Shrek will perform a quest and rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the tower where she is held prisoner. The catch: she's guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Farquaad wants Fiona for his wife (he chose her over Cinderella and Snow White), and figures that the ogre might be his best chance to rescue her. But what he doesn't count on, and what Shrek doesn't expect, is that the beauty and the beast will develop feelings for each other.<br /><br />Many of Shrek's funniest lines (like \\"a castle that big must mean he's compensating for something\\") will go over younger viewer's heads, but there are still plenty that won't (\\"I'm going to save my ass\\", referring to Donkey). The screenplay was obviously written with all age groups in mind. Shrek is not on such a lofty plane that children will feel as if they're missing something, but it isn't lobotomized in a way that will insult the intelligence of older viewers.<br /><br />As impressive as the visuals are - and they are very impressive - Shrek wouldn't be the movie it is without a quartet of effective vocal performances. As this kind of animation becomes more prevalent, the importance of choosing the right voices will need equal care and attention. Voices help to define the characters, and a bad choice can do irreparable damage. Just as not all silent stars were suitable for talkieroles, so not all live-action actors can do vocal performances. Fortunately, Shrek has four capable actors. First and foremost is Mike Myers, who is known as a vocal chameleon. Without seeing his name in the opening credits, you'd never know it was him. John Lithgow plays Faquaad as nasty and short-sighted, but not really evil, which makes a pleasant change from the usual animated villain. Eddie Murphy shows that a real comic genius can get laughs without relying on his own facial expressions and body language. Murphy's Donkey is one of the funniest characters he has brought to the screen. (Here, he improves upon what he did in Mulan.) Finally, Cameron Diaz's princess is equal parts sugar and vinegar. She believes in true love and Prince Charming, but, like her Charlie's Angels alter-ego, she's not afraid to do a little Matrix-style [back] kicking.<br /><br />The interplay between Shrek and Princess Fiona is sweet and tender, while the exchanges between the ogre and the ass are often barbed and subversively funny. Like The Princess Bride, Shrek breaks with convention, but not so far that viewers will be put off by it. And, while there is a happy ending (as there must be in any fairy tale, no matter how unconventional), it's not necessarily the conclusion that many people will be expecting (at least up until the 2/3 point, when the movie reveals its hand). First-time co-directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (he has worked as a visual supervisor on other films, including the two Joel Schumacher Batmans; this is her first credit) have crafted a movie to be proud of, and one that will hopefully receive a lot of attention, even during the crowded summer season.

B0000033TE|5.0|Of all the ELP LP's, and I've got my favourite tracks on every one, this is the ultimate ELP release. When I bought this in 1973, \\"Karn Evil Nine\\", just soared. It still does. I can still see Keith Emerson at the keyboard, being twirled around and around, at the famous 1974 concert \\"The California Jam\\". This is where they peaked!!
1882723171|5.0|Eadie, half native american, raised with in the 1950's in Catholic charity schools, shares her experience of dying and her deep desire to know Jesus.<br /><br />The first standout is that our time on earth is brief compared to eternity. And that there is no judgement for what religious path a good person chooses.<br /><br />The second is that love and compassion is the key to preparing for salvation. I was on the fence about Jesus when I read this book. Really turned off by the fear-mongering right wing zealots of this country and their even more perfected counterparts, the islamic fundamentalists. After reading this book I had an epiphany and knew that the judgemental nature of religious zealots is worthless, but they may even be forgiven, because there is plenty of love in eternity and God loves us all, except when we willfully hurt others.<br /><br />Three is the bombshell of understanding that Eadie's curious mind gained. That Eve wanted more than anything, more than life itself, to give birth. Her great desire to be a mother is what lead to humans having to die. Becuase unless there is death, there is no need for birth.<br /><br />Four we are not wise enough to know all purposes.<br /><br />Five is that freewill is a gift from God to make us more like himself, but in some hands causes great saddness in our realm and beyond. God, Jesus, angels and great spirits are deeply saddened by what some of us do with our free will. They try to help, especially when people pray, but they do not control us. Our will does that.
0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones is a good book, as suggested by the number of favorable reviews posted about it. In general, I tend to disregard the average customer rating on any book, but in this instance it's probably justified. The characters & storyline are combinations of fiction and fantasy - nothing new there I guess. But while most books are straight fiction, or obvious fantasy, Martin toes the line between both. While we do see the potential for fantasy from the first chapter, Martin never delves head-first into a wild fantasy ride that most authors of the genre tend to embark upon.<br /><br />I don't know if that's good or not for the potential reader. It just is. The book barely falls into the realm of fantasy, though there can be no doubt that it does. In this, the first of the series, Martin almost avoids the fantastic altogether. The story is a story on its own merit, rife with intrigue, politics (medieval of course), and the occasional left field directional. While it does bear many of the hallmarks you see in the fantasy genre (horses, castles, swords, dirt roads, lanterns, kings and queens, bravado, the lack of MTV, etc), it never blows open the pages with dragon fire or nebulous forces of evil.<br /><br />So why read this? First, like any good fantasy scribe (or any kind of writer), Martin can put readable words on a page. By \\"readable\\", I mean the pages turn fast and keep you interested despite the size of the book. To be fair, Game of Thrones started too slowly for my tastes, and it took almost 400 pages for the action to get moving. But once it did, it was worth it. The standard fantasy elements are there, just not manifest quite yet.<br /><br />On top of his ability to put words together, I like that the characters are not immortal. Martin establishes early on that you would be a wise reader not to get too attached to any one character, since they might be dead in the next chapter. Of course, Martin makes several of his characters likeable enough that it's hard not to favor them through the narrative. But be warned.<br /><br />My biggest complaint in this regard is that he goes through all sorts of pains to keep Tyrion alive. The rest of the narrative is natural - he seems to be letting the book write itself for the most part. But not the Tyrion storyline, which is annoying to me because it's blatantly inconsistent. Tyrion is the invincible character in a book full of mere mortals. Even though this is a review of the first book, the same trend continues in greater fashion in book 2, my review still on the editing table (I'm sure you're waiting with baited breath).<br /><br />Aside from that, it's hard to complain, unless you cite the slow start, which is an understandable complaint. Overall though, the book moves along swiftly and keeps you interested, coming back for more in the hopes that the character you most like will be the subject of the next chapter. Martin structures his books such that each chapter is named after the character at the center of it, and no consecutive chapters discuss the same character. This actually extended the book somewhat for me, since I lose steam when I have to pick up new scene elements. But some people love this approach.<br /><br />Another element I really enjoy is that there is no clear right or wrong here. There is no hero, no dark force of evil. There just is. Ironically, I heard someone on the train telling his friend about this book tonight, the main point of his recommendation coming when he said, \\"There's an evil troll.\\" Then he paused, and finished with, \\"It's cool.\\" While I knew what he was talking about, nothing could sound less appealing than saying those words to describe this book in Beavis and Butthead fashion.<br /><br />The book, as you have read in other reviews, is based loosely on the Hundred Years War and the War of the Roses. I don't know history well enough to say how much true to life it is, but it seems plausible. Each entity merely represents an angle in a complex tapestry of some complex saga. It makes for more entertaining reading than most fantasy tales which have the common element of The Dark One. No such luck here, as you'll merely have to figure out which character you like the least, then root the other way.<br /><br />Highly recommended, well done.n angle in a complex tapestry of some complex saga.

B000BT97AO|5.0|I came to this film with no preconceptions. I never heard of the producer, director, writer, actors, or artist. I was intrigued by the trailers, walked out of the theater where I saw the trailers and right into the next showing of MirrorMask.     This is a wonderful film.It borrows heavily from fantasy, from Northern Exposures' best mythopoeia and whimsy, and most especially from an extensive reservoir of Western fanatstic art. There are powerful visual allusions to the work of Bosch, Escher, Dali, Magritte, and Remedios Varo, which alone are worth the price of admission. For me, the visual inventiveness of the film tranforms an otherwise routine \\"rite of teen angst\\" tale into a beguiling, riveting experience full of constant and delighting surprises. The writing is reminiscent of the best of Northern Exposure scripts, filled with gentle humor and poignant mythmaking.     The actors, espcially Stephanie Leonidas as Helena and Jason Barry as Valentine, are captivating. They are vivid, accessible, and compelling as the stressed out circus girl, on the verge of womanhood and longing for a \\"normal\\" life away from the circus suddenly confronted with her mother's life-threatening illness, and the unlikely champion she finds in the fantasy world to which she escapes in order to cope with the anxiety of her mother's illness.     I commend this movie to anyone who wants a visual banquet served up with bold dashes of what Northern Exposure once was.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Jewish PEOPLE were no more responsible for the death of Christ than the German PEOPLE were for the death of millions of Jews during World War II. On the contrary, it was the Jewish LEADERS that killed Christ, as it was the German LEADERS that killed the Jews - and both out of envy. If Christ had been born in Ireland or some other country, it would have been their leaders that killed Him. WHO killed Christ is unimportant.<br /><br />What is important is WHY Christ died. He wasn't murdered - He gave up His own life willingly as part of God's plan for saving His people from their sins. If you watch The Passion and all you see is brutality, blood and death, you're missing the point. The point is, without Christ's sacrifice, we would all die in our sins and spend the rest of eternity separated from God, because none of us is good enough to save himself. But God, out of love, took on Himself our sins in the person of Christ. We were the ones scheduled to be brutally beaten and die on that cross; but God, out of love, took the punishment for us and died in our place. He did what we couldn't do for ourselves. And then He did one more thing: He raised Himself from the dead, proving for all time that He indeed was God; and showing that, one day, we, too, would rise again.<br /><br />The Passion Of The Christ shows the sacrifice that Christ made for us, which only love could have compelled Him to do. The brutality only underscores His love. If you don't watch The Passion and see the love behind it, you're missing the point; and, possibly, missing the boat as far as what Christ came to bring.<br /><br />Christ was born to die. He wasn't born to teach, heal or show the way: He IS the Way. He was born to die - not pointlessly, but purposefully, so that we could live. THAT's what The Passion is all about: not brutality, blood and death; but love, sacrifice and life. If you see that when you watch this movie, it's only because God has given you the eyes to see it, as well as the gift to share in what Christ came to bring.<br /><br />Waitsel SmithChrist came to bring.

If I were reviewing the concert alone,  or even the idea to raise awareness,  my rating and review would be far less harsh. <br /> <br />However,  this DVD features a heavily chopped down setlist,  rmoving many great tracks fom some of my favorite acts.  The picture is roughly the same I would have ended up with had I made a VCR recording (SLP) and run it through my VCR a few dozen times.  The Audio,  while better than TV,  seems to leave a lot to be desired in tems of fidelity. <br /> <br />All these flaws come from an attempt to smash the concert sets onto 4 DVDs,  causing both quality and content to suffer.  To say this DVD set does not do the concert justice is an understatement on par with \\"The Titanic sprung a leak.\\" <br /> <br />When purchasing this DVD set,  review the track listing.  Consider the quality in picture and sound you are being asked to settle for.  The remaining tracks may be all you want,  and the video and sound issues might be okay with you if the loss of cetain comment isn't enough to deter you.  but ddo think about your purchase,  as this is worlds away from the concert that we saw on TV.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased the Swivel Sweeper and loved it at first.  So darn handy, pretty powerful for a cheaply made unit.  I was happy and would have ranked it 5 stars at first...

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Five Big Stars!!! Riffing off of the disastrous TV show \\"Firefly\\", Joss Whedon and the most unusual and persistent Cult in SciFi history ('the Browncoats') have kept the flame lit with superlative results: \\"Serenity\\". When Fox refused to let the TV show run it's episodes in sequence and terminated the show early in season one \\"with extreme prejudice\\", Joss stubbornly kept writing and kept the ensemble cast on call. The result is this beautiful piece of a SciFi movie that doesn't have one alien and no major star anywhere in it's universe.<br /><br />Ron \\"Barney Miller\\" Glass, Adam Baldwin, and David \\"Numbers\\" Krumholtz are the big names in this movie and they get less screen time than the others. As far as aliens are concerned, trust me, the Reavers, a carryover of really depraved nasty human guys from the TV show that strike fear in the hearts of anyone who hear their name, are enough evil badness for any Sci Fi Franchise. The Borg would flee from these guys! LOL. But Captain Mal and crew are also always fearful of the Alliance, the 'so-called' civilized central government. Packed with action, loaded with suspense, and with enough new characters to satisfy those of us who watched the TV show and bought the complete \\"FireFly\\" DVD set, this movie is a winner on many levels: originality, storyline, acting, cinematography, sound effects, and music. Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Strait, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass, Morena Baccarin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor scorch the screen as the principles in this 'cat and mouse' game with the surprise ending. Five HUGE Stars!!<br /><br />(Note: My original thought after the first weekend was that the FOX TV executives were laughing their heads off at the meek $15M boxoffice debut of \\"Serenity\\",  but Joss had already gotten over on them. They gave him all rights to the show and the \\"Firefly\\" DVD release soared to 500,000 sales. The movie kept going, thanks to the Browncoats and the new fans, until it 'broke even' at $39M. Joss then released the DVD of \\"Serenity\\" in time for Christmas sales, which will probably yield another 500,000 sales at least. Then there is the eventual release to HBO/Starz/etc, Network TV, and finally to TNT/ Sci Fi channel who will run it \\"forever\\". I can hear Joss modestly chuckling all the way out here in Texas. Who's up for a sequel? I am!!)$39M. Joss then released the DVD of \\"Serenity\\" in time for Christmas sales, which will probably yield another 500,000 sales at least.

Weisz is an activist who is trying to get to the bottom of things as she travels back and forth from Kenya where she things some big shot British guys led by Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Underworld 1 & 2) are in connections with a drug company to use suffering Africians as guinea pigs for their experiments. When Weisz is killed in an a \\"accidental\\" car accident, Fiennes then takes up on what his wife was doing, traveling to Kenya and while he is doing this, he has a contract on his head and Fiennes is running out of time to find out the true. Slow at times but it doesnt matter because Fiennes is dynamic as the man who has lost his wife and everything else. Weisz gives a great performance as well...one of her best to date. Also starring Danny Huston (Birth, Silver City) and the always realiable Pete Postlethwaite. It has drama and policitcal thriller written all over it and its another hit for director Fernando Meirelles who did the masterpiece City Of God.

0312997221|4.0|This book is a lot of fun to read, very interesting. Once in a while Forsyth gets too deep into background, and doesn't weave it well into the story, preferring to give it to you in spurts that can be confusing and too interrupting of the story flow. His editor ought to have done the job a little more thoroughly -- Grumman doesn't exist as an aviation company any longer and certainly does not make intercontinental business jets -- Gulfstream does.<br /><br />The story is certainly interesting, though, and enough material from current events was carefully intertwined to make it believable. I liked the ending, those last two pages were great! :)
B000BGH22W|2.0|First off, to settle the record straight.  In some of the other reviews, it was stated that the director chose not to have John Williams do the score to this movie.  That's not true.  They wanted Williams to compose the score, but he was unavailable because he was scheduled to score Memoirs of a Geisha. <br /> <br />Now that that's out of the way, I will say that as a score by itself, Mr. Doyle's score was a decent score and functioned with the movie as a movie by itself, with a few exceptions that are listed in superb detail in some of the other reviews.  The only problem is that Goblet of Fire is not a movie by itself.  This isn't James Bond or the Ninja Turtles, where each movie is a different story.  The Harry Potter books, much like the Lord of the Rings, are in fact one book broken up into seven parts.  Each part is essential to the overall story.  Likewise, the movies are, essentially, one movie broken into seven parts.  In a situation like this, some level of continuity is necessary. <br /> <br />Mr. Doyle's biggest mistake in his approach toward this score is that he almost entirely neglected that necessary continuity.  It is not an issue of whether Williams did the score or not.  It is an issue of whether the pre-established themes that were given to us by Williams are continued.  Williams wrote Voldemort's theme in the first movie (an appropriate variation of the Harry/Hedwig theme).  That theme is nowhere to be heard.  The Harry/Hedwig theme, the essential backbone of the first three scores, is barely touched upon, and in the few instances where it is heard, it's hardly recognizable.  The Quidditch theme could have been arranged to incorporate the grander scope of the World Cup and maybe even into the tournaments, but it is nowhere to be found. Moaning Myrtle's theme - gone.  Harry's parents theme - gone.  Just imagine how moving it would have been had the family theme come soaring back to us, after all the horror and darkness, when Harry's parents cameout of Voldemort's wand. <br /> <br />Again, this isn't about who is composing the music.  This is about how the established music is treated.  Imagine if John Williams hadn't been able to do Revenge of the Sith and they brought a new guy in who threw out all of the old established material and wrote his own themes.  It would have been completely innappropriate. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if Williams had scored Goblet of Fire and had done it exactly like the first thee, it would have been equally innappropriate.  Goblet of Fire is significantly darker than the others and so the mood should be entirely different.  (For the record, I am sure that if Williams had done this film, he would have been acutely aware of that aspect and darkened the tone of the music.  Look at Prisoner of Azkaban, for example.  That score was definitely not the same tone as the first two films.) <br /> <br />Now, I am a film composer myself, so I understand the artistic need to be original and there's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not saying that Boyle should have abandoned his own personal style and completely emulated Williams.  Williams is Williams and Boyle is Boyle.  As I said, this is not about who is composing the music, but how the pre-established thematic material is treated.  Boyle could have easily taken on the thematic material available to him and added his own personal touch to it, which honestly would have made for an amazing score.  If he had done that, he would not have broken the continuity of the story as a whole and he might have been able to strengthen the few places in the score that just plain didn't work for the film on its own. <br /> <br />I will be curious to see what will happen with Order of the Phoenix.  Should Williams return, he will be faced with the choice of picking up the series where he left off, or picking up where Doyle left off.  At the finale of Goblet of Fire, we have been left with two completely different themes for Voldemort and one half-hearted theme for Harry/Hedwig.  Should Doyle return, that will most likely increase the divide between the first three movies and the last four.  Since the Harry Potter franchise is not really seven separate movies but one movie divided into seven sections, there should not be a divide in the continuity anywhere, regardless of how darkly the tone has changed. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a fair score.  Not memorable and a tad simplistic, but it functioned with what was happening on the screen.  What it lacked above else was the necessary continuity.  Should Doyle return to the series, I hope that he shall put his artistic ego on check and realize that each score does not stand out on its own, but as part of a whole.
B00005JOFO|4.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" the film is a perfectly faithful and reasonable adapatation of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" the short story by Annie Proulx. I saw the film before I read the story, and was deeply moved and affected by it. However, I highly recommend that people read the short story in order to fill in the gaps left by this movie. Many reviewers here complain about the reticence of Heath Ledger's character, Ennis Delmar. In reading the short story I realized that Ledger's performance is true to Ennis, but this may not be fully understood without reading the story. Proulx writes in a third-person limited voice from Ennis's perspective. The story opens with Ennis waking up early in his tiny trailer, having just lost another ranching job because his boss is finally selling his property. Unemployed with no prospects, contemplating having to move in with his married daughter until he can find another job, Ennis is nonetheless happy because he has awakened from a dream about Jack. He tells himself not to demand too much of the dream, only asking that the way he feels now will last the rest of what will otherwise be another bleak day in his small life. As the events related in the film unfold in flashback, we come to understand that Ennis does not fully realize at first that what he feels for Jack is love; it takes the reunion of the two four years later for him to understand this truth, and even then he fears it as much as he allows himself to feel joy and completeness in it. The story goes on to illuminate some of the ambiguities in the film, including its ending. The only other remark I will make here is that what saddens me about this film, other than its tragic story, is that the people who really need to see it probably won't do so. I doubt the reviewer who referred to it as liberal propaganda in a one-paragraph screed has actually seen it; he could, after all, get everything he says about it from reading the reviews posted here. Those who oppose what they call the \\"homosexual agenda\\" fail to realize that demanding that gay people deny what they feel is infinitely more destructive and dangerous than allowing them to be who they are. If Ennis and Jack had been able to let their love flourish, the only damage to society would have been that a couple of cowboys would have lived alone on a little ranch somewhere, bothering no one. But their own preconceived notions and the expectations of their society forced them to take actions which left wounded wives and fatherless children in the wake of their own heartbreak. In Proulx's story, this is made even more clear, as Ennis is left only with dreams of Jack that sometimes help him through his day but also often leave him weeping into his pillow at night, his memories encapsulated in those dreams and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked to the wall of his trailer, with his old shirt and one of Jack's hanging on a nail beneath it. That society would demand this kind of heartbreak of consenting adults is ugly and cruel. However, screeds like the one posted here are hopefully the last desperate gasps of fanatics who know that they have already lost, that society is increasingly coming to accept (the reviewer calls it being \\"desensitized\\") that deviation from the norm is not necessarily a crime or a moral failure. In the short term, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will be a celebrated film that conserve-hate-ives throw out as yet another example of Hollywood and the media's evil liberal bias. In the long term, it may be recognized as one of the milestones on society's path from bigotry to tolerance.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|I went to see The Hostel with a couple friends in a debate over what movie to see. It turned out to be a pretty alright thriller. No big jumps or thrills down your back are necessary in this one. Three Americans go to Europe only to find out that death is just around the corner. This movie brought back alot of ideas from Eurotrip, except with the horror touch, not comical. Some of the parts could have been more real though, like the part where Hernandez clips off the Asian lady's eye and all you see is a yellow pus-like substance dripping out. A lot of blood and useless killing in the movie. Basically the most exciting scenes are where you see them in the chairs about to be torn apart. It could have been a bit more intense though. It's a bloody trip, but maybe worth it.
B000002U82|5.0|You've probably seen the album cover on people's shirts before, and you've probably already heard of Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon before. And once you buy this album you will know why it's proclaimed to be one of the best albums ever. It truly is beautiful music. Every song has already gone down as a true classic, and every song will probably be one of your favorite songs for at least a short period of time. If you're young and new with classic rock, this album is perfect to get the feel of how rock was back in the day. Great music never sounds old, and you should never get tired of music you truly like. Dark Side Of The Moon is a perfect example of music that never gets old. It can fit any mood you may be in. But it's especially good if you just want to sit back, relax, and evaluate life. I don't want to sound like a peace-loving hippie, cause i'm not, but this music is really beautiful. New age rock doesn't come close to this. Remember, this was rock before the word \\"sellout\\" and \\"pop\\" because all of the rock today is pop rock sellouts, where every song has to sound the same so they can sell half a million records. This is actually MUSIC. Like I said, just buy it and you will see what I mean. Pink Floyd is one of the bands that younger people are embracing. It's no wonder younger kids are beginning to like all the classic rock stuff. It's actually quite simple - today's rock is pathetic to say the least, and classic rock is timeless. To people under the age of 30, rap is now more popular in America than rock, and why? Because these poor excuses for bands are putting out music that the billboard charts want them to put out. Anyways, i'm getting off topic, the bottomline is over 1,000 people have put out their reviews for this album, and 85% of them put 5 stars. Probably just a fluke. If you ask me, Pink Floyd is one of the best bands ever, and this is one of their best albums. This album will change you for the better. Nothing more to say.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|The movie would have been greatly improved if not for the (mostly) unnessary third rate CGI.
B000084T18|5.0|I remember back when this album came out, everybody loved it. I mean, even the rockers liked a few songs on this album. But then, after about a year and a half of GRODT being out, every started sippin on the G Unit haterade, and all the sudden 50 Cent is hated by many people. I checked on this cd on Amazon back when about 750 reviews were written, and it had 5 stars! Now, after 50's Massacre, people decide that they don't like GRODT either (Only 3.5 stars), after selling 11 million records. You can say what you want about The Massacre, but anybody who knows what their talking about knows that GRODT is a very hot album and is an example of how good a rapper 50 was during his underground stage, back when he was the best underground rapper alive. (If you haven't heard his mixtapes, you should, they are great, 50's flow is explosive and fast). This was 50 before the haterade, and he really exploits his talents on this cd. Most of the songs on here are very gritty, gangsta, and gutter, the way 50 should have it, not pop records. His lyrics are actually pretty good (the best you can get from a Jamaica Queens gangster) and like I said his flow is much better than in the Massacre. The beats are the biggest thing on the album though, Dr Dre put out his best beats for 50, and anybody who appreciates rap music will love the beats on this album, they are crazy good! Some of the best songs, other than the singles, because you've probably heard a few of them before are Patiently Waiting, Many Men, High All the Time, If I Can't, and Back Down. It's a shame I had to spend half of the review explaining why 50 had only 3.5 stars, but just remember, those are just Gunit hater freaks giving it 1 star and only writng 2 lines just to be idiots. Don't get me wrong, 50 has plenty of fans, but some jealous ones had to envy. There was a time, when GRODT was on top and if you buy it you will know why. It was gangsta rap at it's finest and 50 when he was a really hot rapper. So, as I said before, this was 50 at his best when everybody loved him, before the haterade was passed around. You will love this album if you get it, the beats are off the chain-crazy and you will like every song, it's definitely one of the best albums of 2003 if not the best.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I'm quite finicky when it comes to the horror/thriller department, and I can say that this was one of the best films I rented last year.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|First, to all of the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth lovers (of which, I am one), we will always have that remarkable masterpiece.  Therefore, we should be able to judge any new versions freely.  Having said that, this version is great! <br /> <br />This movie is quite shorter than what we're used to for P&P adaptations and at first it seemed to me that the dialogue was rushed, but after the first 15 minutes it either slowed down or I ceased to notice it, until Darcy's proposal scene anyway, but it worked quite well there. <br /> <br />This film is also much more of a comedy than the two BBC versions.  There were minor changes with dialogue but none of the changes lessened any of the characters or the spirit of the story.  Instead, it probably enhanced the feelings the audience shared with the characters. In fact, I think that everything left out of the two previous BBC versions were added to this one so you still get something new from the same story. <br /> <br />One major change is the loss of Mr. and Mrs. Hurst.  In a two-hour movie there just isn't enough time to do their characters justice.  The rest of the cast is so marvelous though that we barely notice they're missing and it makes the movie flow more naturally. <br /> <br />The actors chosen are wonderful in their parts.  I didn't think I'd be able to accept Keira Knightley as Elizabeth but after the first five minutes I was completely taken in by her.  She pulls off Elizabeths witty dialogue like, well... Elizabeth and just as Jennifer Ehle added some distinctive traits to Lizzie, so does Keira.  She wonderfully manages to show us Lizzie's love of a good laugh without making it seem as though she was a giggling loony and every time she smiles, we smile with her.  <br />I won't critique all the performances but I have to add that Donald Sutherland really does a spectacular job as the head of a household of silly women.  The last scene with him and Lizzie had me in tears.   <br /> <br />Not to say that this movie was perfect, what adaptation can be without some faults or silly alterations?  None are too serious though.  The first is at the Meryton ball, when Darcy, Bingley and Caroline walk in, everything stops.  The music, the dancing, all conversation and the crowd parts to offer them a path.  I thought for a second the crowd had mistaken Mr. Bingley for royalty.  It just seemed a bit over the top.  But it passed quickly enough.  The other was actually Darcy's proposal scene which was done in the rain.  I thought it silly that he would follow her outside in such weather to propose, but one can accept that in view of the other changes that turned out so well.  <br />I give this movie 5 stars because I wouldn't want to miss it and I don't think any P&P fan should. <br />All in all, if you have a good sense of humor and aren't afraid to laugh, like Elizabeth, you will just enjoy the story as it is played out.  Remember, afterwards you can always put Jennifer and Colin Firth back in the DVD player.
0307276902|2.0|Hmmm. Frey is kind of a fake I guess. I'm not surprised but I guess what surprises me more is the way the media has fallen all over themselves to ride the Frey Express. How hard is it to write a book like this? I guess it's easy to judge but I really thought it stunk. There's a million little stories like this on every sad street in America but we somehow glorify this self promoter who gets off on telling us how BAD he is. Pathetic, yes. A con man? No Doubt! He's put one over on the whole world, not  just his identity but his ability to make people think that this piece of literary garbage is somehow great writing.
074322454X|5.0|This story offers not only an incredible slice of history from WWII, it is a gripping account of this amazing group of men and their commitment to each other.  I was quite moved by the depth of their relationships and how it continued after the war.  A great read!
0812975219|3.0|Nothing earth shattering here, but author has good ideas and information in book is definitely usefull.
1591840562|5.0|This is a great book. With clear concepts described that otherwise must be intuited. To win the race one must not only lead the start, but give back to those around us. Read the last chapter twice. Once at the start of the book, and again at the end.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|The story so far: 5 stars isn't enough.<br /><br />For anyone who listens to this and says (like some misguided reviewers here) \\"It's not the same\\" or \\"The tempos are all wrong\\" or anything along the lines of \\"Those were the days\\" -- you need to get your hands on the DVD and listen to the interviews with Bruce, Clapton, and Baker.<br /><br />The could have done this with the full complement of whiz-bang they used back in the day, plus all kinds of modern electronics to emulate the heavy post-production work of the studio albums. Clapton could have come out with a Les Paul and a bank of Marshalls, they could've had Yo-Yo Ma do the cello parts on \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\".<br /><br />They decided to do it as themselves, as they are and work now, using the tools they use now. No backing musicians. No effects, not even a wah-wah pedal in evidence. Just three musicians standing up there playing straight up.<br /><br />Pretty gutsy for a bunch of old geezers who haven't played together in more years than most of the people reviewing this CD have been alive.<br /><br />Carping about the accuracy of the renditions is simply idiotic: it's like complaining that Clapton didn't overdub himself on the version of \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" on the new CD. Well, of course he didn't, nitwit! That was what you call a \\"studio effect\\", and there is no way to do that live without trickery.<br /><br />And carping about the more leisurely pace of some of the songs ignores two things about the original performances. Cream were not playing *with* each other, but *against* each other: the result was bristling with energy, but they didn't sound so much like a band as a competition. And frankly, some of the music suffered from being driven at 220 volts when it was really intended for 110.<br /><br />These performances are by mature artists who are actually... listening to each other, playing with and off each other. Every aspect of the performance -- vocals, pacing, musicianship -- is more relaxed, but what it's given up in methedrine intensity it's more than gained in depth, nuance, and soul.<br /><br />Listen to the 22-year-old Clapton singing \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", like a church choirboy, on \\"Disraeli Gears\\". Now listen to the vocal on the new CD. No comparison: that sweet little choirboy voice was just wrong for that song. Same thing for Bruce: his voice is almost as beautiful as it was back then, but it's gained depth, and his vocals are more nuanced and sound like they're being experienced, not just produced.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: the version of \\"White Room\\" on \\"Wheels of Fire\\" will never be surpassed: the fluidity of the guitar line in the third verse is heartbreakingly beautiful. But the new version stands on its own.<br /><br />Try this experiment: suspend expectations, and just listen to these songs as though hearing them for the first time. Evaluate them on their own terms, without thinking \\"It's Cream\\" or \\"These are three *old* geezers.\\" This is a fabulous band, masterful musicianship, great songs, regardless of whether they're 22 or 62. This is not a re-recording of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" -- it's a whole new being.<br /><br />BTW, anyone who dismisses this as being commercially-motivated: it was Clapton's idea, and he's doin' OK financially. He had to talk Baker into it. Part of the motivation, if you can believe Clapton, was that he missed playing this way; part of it, if you believe Baker, was that Bruce's recent serious illness got them thinking \\"If not now, maybe never\\".<br /><br />Aside from any other aspect of this reunion, it is wonderful to see three musicians who were famously dysfunctional personally looking like they're finally enjoying playing together. To me, and to anyone who's been with Cream since the beginning, this alone would give the reunion value, even if it hadn't produced a great CD and an even better DVD.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Macbeth comes to Japan, and although it's set in feudal times and sometimes has the feel of a classic Noh play, Kurosawa borrows freely from Shakespeare: there are the prophecies of an evil spirit; there's Lady Macbeth feeding the fire of her husband's ambition and madly trying to wash the blood off her hands; and, of course, there's Birnam woods moving toward the castle at the end. Toshiro Mifune is Macbeth, and the final scene as he's barraged with countless arrows is a classic. Isuzu Yamada is Lady Macbeth, and she puts in a virtuoso performance of frightening proportions. The movie is very atmospheric - foggy woods, braying horses, an eerie musical score - that only adds to its intensity; but it's also poetic and moving in its own unique way. It's a brilliant piece of filmmaking. [I identify the characters using Shakespeare's play; in the movie they have Japanese names.]
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Ralph Fiennes plays a British diplomat who meets a fiery activist named Tessa.  When he is assigned to a post in Kenya, she begs to come along as his wife or mistress.  He marries her, and is completely devoted to her, but there are indications that she is unfaithful to him.  She leads a double life in other ways and becomes involved in a group which opposes irresponsible dispensing of drugs by large pharmaceutical companies.  When she dies, there are many unanswered questions which Fiennes spends the rest of the movie trying to answer.  This is a beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie.  At times the flashbacks are confusingly juxtaposed with the current action, but generally is makes for interesting and engrossing viewing.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Every once in a while I look for a story that brings back a little bit of magic. <br /> <br />This rendition of the Peter Pan story is well done, with all of the classic elements that make the original story so wonderful and beautiful costuming and details that set this apart from other retellings. <br /> <br />Peter Pan is just as I'd always pictured him: cocky, full of mischief, proud, and still sensitive. And most definitely incredibly cute in that heart-stopping way that could have left a young teenage me day dreaming about first kisses and starlit skies. <br /> <br />Wendy Darling is a sweet and beautiful girl, innocent and on the brink of beginning to blossom. She's a bit of a tomboy, which I love about her, with a spunky personality and an incredible imagination. <br /> <br />Hook is spectacular as a villain, mesmerizing and frightening rather than ridiculous or over-dramatic as he can be portrayed in other renditions of the story. <br /> <br />And most definitely something that caught me while watching this movie was the ever so important first kiss. Something precious and not given lightly, that stops the heart and catches the breath and has this life-changing quality that makes it something you will never forget.
B000002NBY|5.0|Simply the greatest album ever made.
B000002AE3|3.0|A really strong effort from toto- but a couple of minor quibbles. Nothing wrong with Steve as the leaf vocalist, but I was generally used to more lead vocalist taking on different tracks. Also this album is really programed as: track 1: upbeat, track 2: ballad, track 3: upbeat, track 4: ballad, and this formula continues thorugh until the end. <br />Some of the tracks are a bit generic and I am not familiar with them, even on repeated listens. <br />'Drag him to the roof' is a really good rock song. I think the riff at the beginning is extremely catchy. And it is refreshing that David Paich sings lead (I think), not Steve. Chorus is also effective. One of the better rockers on the album. <br />'Gift of faith' is also an excellent opener and sounds single worthy. <br />'Baby he's your man' is an example of the generic style rocker, I was talking about. A dull, repetitive rock song. I also cannot remember how it goes, or the other rocker 'turning point'. 'Just can't get to you' is probably one of the most dull ballads I have heard, with an annoying repetitive, meaningless chorus. This is the weakest track here by a long way. <br />Don't be fooled by the title 'Dave's gone skiing'- it might seem like a filler track, but is one of the strongest- the first section is a fast and catchy passage, followed by a second slower section with some virtuoso piano playing and a spine tingling electric guitar solo. The instrumental then reverts back to the first catchy section. <br />The final song is the ballad 'The road goes on'. Nice harmony vocals, reminiscent of 'I will remember'. This is a beautiful song and probably the strongest on the album. <br />It is a real mixed bag this one. They should have left off the aforementioned three tracks, but some of the other stuff here is first rate.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Somebody has cross the path again.  Complaining about a movie that is meant for entertainment.  Mr. DeMille's \\"The Ten Commandments\\" 1956 movie, use to entertain me until I grew up and started to notice how horrible the acting was with the exception of Yul Brynner. <br /> <br />\\"What Dreams May Come\\" was an enchanting movie, nothing more!  This is only a movie and if it enlightens someone than more power to it.  Stop being judgmental by quoting the so call almighty word.  This movie was not design to change your beliefs nor was it trying to change your beliefs.  If this movie offends you it may not have anything to do with your religious beliefs it might be do to your hate towards life. <br /> <br />Sure, voice your opinion but think it over before you start telling other how to live their life.  I did notice that 2 out of 33 seem to agree with you.  I didn't add my number to make it 2 out of 34 because there is no need to. <br /> <br />Enjoy the film or just let it go.  Please stop judging others and warning them about Hell.  Only you are facing that hell and that is here on Earth. <br /> <br />This letter is only a response to the individual who quotes the Bible. <br />
B00005JOFO|4.0|Watching this film I was reminded of that old Alan Alda film \\"Same Time Next Year\\" where two people, married to others, meet the same weekend each year for a tryst that goes on for generations. In this film each character has found a happy respite from their spouce and that's enough.  <br /> <br />In Brokeback Mountain the tryst carries on for years, but for a different reason. Yes, they desire each other and escape, but in this film society places a much larger roll. If this were a man and woman they most likely would have run away together and never looked back. But they are two men in 1963 Wyoming and that simply isn't done. Their tryst stands the test of time but when you look deeper this is a character study at its best. Ultimately it isn't society that keeps them apart...it's each other. Health Ledgers character, carrying deep emotional baggage, cannot make the necessary sacrifices to achieve happiness. Even as time and society change to his advantage.  <br /> <br />What's most compelling about this story is that even though it's a time capsule, it's also timeless. These characters could exist today or twenty years from today. There are always people who find reasons to throw happiness away, and wind up inviting heart break. And even though this film is heart breaking, I recommend it for the cinematography, fantastic cast, and the always surprising unhappy ending that Hollywood is rarely brave enough to provide.
B000AGTPUA|3.0|Hate to be a Scrooge, but this is a train-wreck of a movie (pun intended).  It's as if the film-makers set out to see how many different themes, visual effects, musical styles and Tom Hanks's they could cram into one movie.  I really have no idea what the film is about. <br /> <br />Having said that, many of the things that are crammed into this movie are well done.  The music is great, especially the duet between the African-American girl and the boy from the other side of the tracks.  The roller coaster effects were great, I wish I could have seen this in the theater--it would be really cool on IMAX.  Although I'm not sure we need to more apologetics for Santa Claus, the movie has some thought provoking insights into the nature of faith in general. <br /> <br />For parents: there are some spooky scenes which may be inappropriate for small children.  My kids (aged 8-13) liked it a lot, however.
0393312836|4.0|Having never saw the movie, I didn't exactly know what to expect from the original book, but I was not disappointed.  Suitibly creepy, the world this takes place in is not that implausible.  A semi-totalitarian government rules the day, adolescent street gangs rule the night, the cops are recruited from the street gangs, so as redirect their violence into \\"constructive\\" activities, and the prisons are so overflowing with political prisoners that there is barely any room for actual criminals.  The central plot centers on a governemnt experiment to eliminate crime through mind control, and leaves the reader asking, \\"Is it better to be evil by one's own choice than to be good without a choice?\\"
6303965415|5.0|This movie version is perhaps one of the best adaptations of this Jane Austen novel. As, superb performances of Amanda Root and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds make this movie a success. Persuasion tells the story of lost love renewed, and gives the viewer a taste of the grandness and degradation, of 19th century England. Diverse lifestyles of classes clash and we see the prejudices come forth when a lady: Anne Elliot( Root) rejects a dignified but penniless naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Hinds).<br /><br />Eight years later, Anne's father's extravagant lifestyle catches up with him. And, Anne must face a truth-- that the man 'beneath her' was the man 'for her.'Obstacles arise, preventing Anne and Wentworth from declaring their feelings at first. But then, both of them come to grips with the fact that they love each other despite everything. And, Wentworth's surprising declaration to Anne in a letter, will move you.
0393317552|5.0|As a survey of the last 13,000 years of human history, this is very well-done.  Surprisingly detailed, it covers many different aspects of history- specific events, general trends, environmental factors.  Not to mention I learned a lot about agriculture and where our familiar domestic plants and animals come from.  His environmental explanations are convincingly argued, and the information he uses is up to date.  Well worth it.
6304595247|5.0|Life in the English moors takes on a whole new meaning when you see Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes smolder on screen. In the midst of haunting music, and beautiful scenery, Fiennes gives the performance of his life in this tearjerker. Timothy Dalton's portrayal (1970 version) was wonderful. But, Fiennes portrays the despised, rejected, afflicted, dejected, conflicted, tormented, furious Heathclilff to a fault. The way he breaks through the door, and grabs up Catherine's corpse and weeps, leaves you crying right along with him. We see his passion, rage, deep seeded heartbreak and torment. That's true love, I say-- not being able to let go. And that's what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.<br /><br />Juliet Binoche polishes off Fienne's performance with her magnificent portrayal of the beautiful, lighthearted, frivolous, conflicted Catherine whose genuine love for two men leaves her in torment.  But, the added pleasure is that this movie keeps to the original plot to the beautiful and gripping ending in which the narrator says: 'and some swear on their bibles that he still walks.'<br /><br />Great movie!

B00004WGAI|5.0|Why is it, they cannot find a plain Jane for Jane Eyre? If you have read the classic, then you know how this gothic romance progresses. The movie is so well put together that you do not know that it is an 11-episode BBC miniseries. You see it as one long movie with alot of detail.<br /><br />  The actors' portrayals are stupendous--from the willful and impetuous Sian Pattenden as young Jane; to the demure yet spirited Zelah Clarke as the older Jane. Zelah sizzles with the ever handsome and debonair Timothy Dalton who is superb as the imperious, tortured Edward Rochester.This adaptation keeps right to the devastating plot of Charlotte Bronte's novel. Dalton especially, pulls off his long lines grandly.<br /><br />Though the visual effects leave something to be desired, the plot twists, drama, and gothic aura of spookiness keep the viewer interested-- As we see the unwitting innocent governess at beautiful Thornfield, suspecting the dark awful truth about her seemingly perfect employer.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of a down has come a long way to this point. All of their career ambitions have come to this point. In my opinion, this is their most jolting and ambitious album (especially since its apart of a double album). It aims to please all of their fans. If your a fan of SOAD's dark but lively humor you will enjoy tracks like \\"Vicinity of Obsenity\\" and \\"She's Like Heroin\\". If you favor their straight up thrash tracks you'll be pleased by \\"U- FIg\\", \\"Attack\\" and others. If you really dug their epic songs in the past like aerials, you'll love \\"Holy Mountains\\" and \\"Soldier Side\\". They also managed to throw something new into the mix. The song is called \\"Lonely Day\\". It is a softcore ballad and doesnt sound anything like other SOAD songs. Suprisingly, in my opinion they pull it off. Alot of people may disagree with me on this but Daron stepped up to the plate and sung a great tune. Mind you this album has alot of Daron singing (Same as mezmerize) then any other SOAD album. I think Daron and Serj make great harmonys and give off a great vibe and contrast to eachother. As it comes to music on this album it is top notch. Daron and shavo work together perfectly and the drummer of SOAD, John Dolyman, work is also impressive. SOAD has definitly changed from their first album and that is a good thing. But have they changed for the better? I really think so. They get down more to real emotions and their songs are more comprehensive and easier to connect with. A good example of haunting truth of this album is Serj's gentle cry on \\"Tentative\\" as he sings \\"Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\". No massive rashy screaming. Just simple honest Rock. But dont let this fool you. On \\"U-FIG\\" The singing, or should I say yelling is very old school SOAD. You cant barely understand it but you still love it. \\"U-FIG\\" also demonstrates SOAD's ability to complete slow down a song in the middle of a Heavy rock out. They've done it before in \\"Chic N Stu\\" off of \\"Steal this album!\\" and\\"Radio/Video\\" off of \\"Mezmerize\\". In \\"U-Fig\\" a soulful fast pasted acoustic guitar comes in and completely takes you out of the songs vibe, then BANG! Serj comes right back and screams his head off again.  <br />       Another song that really pushed it to the edge was \\"Holy Mountains\\". This is the \\"epic\\" song of the album besides Soldier Side. The verse of this song creeps out your ears when Serjs tweaked a bit voice says \\"Can...you...feel..their haunting presents?\\" and his chorus Crys of \\"We're Free!\\". In all honest this song can give you goosebumps. Another haunting song is the majorly anticipated \\"Soldier Side\\". First preluded on \\"Mezmerize\\" as a short intro to this massive double album. It really relates to the now issues of troops overseas. Not neccesarily the political view but the personal, emotional view of all the men and women who have had to leave thier families behind and go out on thier own, all alone. Emotional lyrics such as \\"Young men standing on the top of their own graves, wondering when jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?\\". This is one of SOAD's best songs of all time. It rightfully deserves this title. This should definitly be a single, and have a video made. A great message could come of this. It is a great way to close out the Mezmerize/Hypnotize double album. This is one of the best rock albums out there today. Its rare to find a band like SOAD that cand do so much with so little. Take advantage of this great album and get what you can from it. Get Mezmerize/Hypnotize and listen to them both. You'll see what SOAD has to offer. Thank you, and Goodnight.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|With The Brothers Grimm you have a excellent plot with two fantastic, seasoned and hunky actors (what did they DO to Heath Ledger!?), and two great producers/directors ... what could go wrong? Whoever actually put the film together let all of the wind out of their sails. The movement of the story initially is herky-jerky, the attempts to make the French occupiers look imbelic just made them annoying and the editing actually made me think that there was something wrong with the DVD at a couple of points. That being said, I still liked the movie. I just think that it could have been superb where it was only okay.<br /><br />The story line is that the two brothers travel the land building a reputation and a fortune vanguishing folk loric villians like witches and trolls which in reality they, with the help of two other con artists, have contrived to scare the local populace.  The setting is French occupied Germany and the French authorities who have figured out their scam continuously waffle between putting them to death and forcing them to uncover the identity of another set of suspected con artists practicing the same cons on the small German town of Marbaden. As the brothers look for clues of how the con is being perpetrated, they find themselves in the same kind of battles they had fought in as con artists but this time with a real witch and no pulleys or wires. They must learn how to vanquish the witch before the French vanquish them and the children of Marbaden are lost forever.<br /><br />They really missed the mark with the French. They tried so hard to make them unlikeable and stupid that they went way over the top and I feared a few times that it would drop out of the time period entirely into a more Monty Pythonic type of humor. Nothing against Monty Python but this also contributed to the poor movement of the film and may have even been the biggest distraction.
0345457684|5.0|The best of Morgan's books, to praise by faint damning.      Enter Takeshi Kovacs, a ruthless ex-Envoy (a UN commando specializing in crushing planetary independence movements), and not your father's protaganist. Invisioning a future where conciousness can be downloaded into \\"sleeves\\", or human bodies, and death is but a momentary inconvienence, Morgan's novel is excellent science-fiction detective noir.     Dark, suspenseful, with a lead who is actually believable, Morgan's debut is incredible.  But, I'm doing it a disservice. Go out and read it yourself.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Somehow, though David Lynch has a very unique signature style to his movies, he's still managed to fill his filmography with a wide variety of very different motion pictures.  Because of this eclectic gathering of subject matter, I like some Lynch films more than others.  They range from the mildly entertaining (BLUE VELVET, MULLHOLAND DRIVE, and WILD AT HEART) to the absolutely amazing (STRAIGHT STORY, LOST HIGHWAY... and THE ELEPHANT MAN). <br /> <br />I had only seen ELEPHANT MAN on television and it was many years ago.  Since then, I've developed the opinion that LOST HIGHWAY is the best thing Lynch has ever made.  Now, having viewed this excellent DVD of ELEPHANT MAN, I may have to change my tune.  I do believe this film is Lynch's best work. <br /> <br />ELEPHANT MAN combines Lynch's quirky art-film attitude with a dramatic and heartwarming drama.  There's the art side - bizarre subject matter, odd editing, and beautiful cinematography - that only certain movie-viewers can appreciate.  But there is also a well-written and brilliantly executed human drama (brought to life by outstanding performances) that almost any viewer will appreciate. <br /> <br />The DVD contains an excellent, gorgeous transfer and encoding of the movie.  The bonus features focus on the very well-made make-up effects and even include some creepy shots of the actual Elephant Man's nightmarish skeleton. <br /> <br />Add this movie to your collection.
0694003611|2.0|(Sigh) . . .When is this book going to come off of Toys R Us' bestsellers list  . . .I really don't get it . . . <br />I purchased this book recently along with some others on the childrens bestsellers list. Well everyone says its a classic and how great it is so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. As soon as I opened it up I was sorry I wasted my money on it.  Here is my take on it . . . Of all the books I purchased I thought this was the most boring and the strangest of the lot. The book begins by describing what objects are in this \\"great green room\\" and then one by one says goodnight to each of the objects.  There are even some black and white pictures on some of the pages. What kid wants to look at black and white illustrations? Even many adults will find it boring. The book has an illustration of a rabbit sitting in a rocking chair knitting in this green room, she is described as \\"a quiet old lady\\" . . . ooooookay very spooky. <br />My 23 month old twin boys have never been interested in this book they never look at it twice.  When I read it to them, I get a blank look on their faces. For our nightly storytime they bring me tons of books to read but they never pick this one up and they completely overlook it.  I think both of them and myself would like to forget that this dull book is in our home library and really wouldn't mind if it just disappeared altogether. <br /> <br />Trust me, save your money - and don't buy this old book.  Not everything classic is good.  Our kids live in an age of Elmo, Blue Clues, Dora and lots of other fun colorful characters, that are doing a great job at keeping their little minds positively engaged in a fun way.
0156711427|5.0|At the end of A Passage to India, the British hero, Cyril Fielding, and the Indian doctor, Aziz, attempt to fully reconcile and restore their friendship before they part ways for good. With that their horses swerve apart, the path divides, rocks jut up and all the obstacles, from the sky to the town below \\"said in their hundred voices, `No, not yet,' `No not there.'\\"  Forster, like Kipling, wrote of an unbridgeable gap between East and West.<br /><br /> Cyril Fielding is an educator who as the audacity not to take the British stance that Aziz, a respected doctor, tried to violate Adela Quested in the Marabar caves.  What really happened is the book's question, and to show its complexity we visit the world of the British club, and begin to understand its expatriate members and their opinions on the locals.  We see the national challenge that the Hindus and Moslems face with each other, and are privy to what to many would be a very confusing Hindu worship ceremony.  We also hear and see the perspective of the nationals to the Britons and to their control, and see them dream and strive for some type of workable nationalism.  Written in an engaging prose and helped by solid character development, A Passage to India is the work of a gifted writer.  I discovered Forster by confusing him with C.S. Forrester, the author of The African Queen, and discovered that I was familiar with his works from the films A Room with a View and Howard's End, both adapted from his books. Forester was an insightful writer of the human condition, and I was impressed with many of his comments:<br /><br /> \\"Mrs. Moore did not take the disappointment as seriously as Miss Quested, for the reason that she was 40 years older, and had learned that life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate. Adventures to occur, but not punctually.\\"<br /><br /> \\"There is no harm in deceiving society as long as she does not find you out, because it is only when she finds you out that you have harmed her; she is not like a friend or God, who are injured by the mere existence of unfaithfulness.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence.\\"<br /><br /> \\"She was only recommending the universal brotherhood he sometimes dreamed of, but as soon as it was put into prose it became untrue.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Although her hard schoolmistressy manner remained, she was no longer examining life, but being examined by it; she had become a real person.\\"<br /><br /> \\"After 40 years' experience, he learned to manage his life and make the best of it on advanced European lines, had developed her personality, explored his limitations, controlled his passions-and had done it all without becoming either pedantic or worldly.  A creditable achievement, but as the moment passed he felt he ought to have been working at something else the whole time-he didn't know at what, never would know, never could know, and that is why he felt sad.\\"<br /><br /> The question of the Marabar Caves is the central point around which the book revolves.  Yet as important are the cultures, history, religions and way of life between groups of people, all expressed adroitly by Forster.  As he himself said, his work is \\"about something wider than politics...about the universe as embodied in the Indian earth and the Indian sky.\\"t that you have harmed her; she is not like a friend or God, who are injured by the mere existence of unfaithfulness.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"She was only recommending the universal brotherhood he sometimes dreamed of, but as soon as it was put into prose it became untrue.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Although her hard schoolmistressy manner remained, she was no longer examining life, but being examined by it; she had become a real person.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"After 40 years' experience, he learned to manage his life and make the best of it on advanced European lines, had developed her personality, explored his limitations, controlled his passions-and had done it all without becoming either pedantic or worldly.

B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down are probably the best Nu-Metal band ever! Their heritage is Armenian and it shows because of the thrash metal like riffs and Serj's kick-ass voice! The band's 1st album was a self-titled debut in 1998. It was great but just an appetizer. Then in 2001 SOAD released Toxicity and it blew everyone away! It was a major improvement from their 1998 self-titled debut mainly because it was much more emotional and focused! Suddenly one week after this album was released, the infamous 9/11 attacks happened! The album quickly became controversial because its anti-government messages kind of offended some, at the time. But not even 9/11 ruined this album! Here are the songs:<br />Prison Song: 5/5 A very political song with Serj doing a reggae like voice which is cool! Very very political and kind of funny as well. About the problem with the law.<br />Needles: 5/5 This song is about heroin and why it should be avoided. The chorus has the catchy line, \\"Pull the tapeworm out of your ass!\\" and Daron Malakian (SOAD's back-up singer and guitarist) drops a great number here!<br />Deer Dance: 5/5 Along with Prison Song this is the most political song. About child abuse and the government not helping it. Serj has a really amazing voice here!<br />Jet Pilot: 3/5 My least favourite song on the album. The Armenian like guitar solo is cool but this song is too short, just a bunch of noise, and very confusing.<br />X: 4/5 This song is about the Genocide from 1915. Very cool intro and guitars! Sadly it's also too short, in fact even shorter than Jet Pilot.<br />Chop Suey!: 5/5 How could we forget Chop Suey? The album's most popular song is also one of my top 3 songs on Toxicity! This song is about war and the chorus is very beautiful! This song was controversial because of 9/11 but screw those wimps!<br />Bounce: 4/5 The album's wierdest and funniest song. It's about Serj trying to woo a group of girls with exotic pogo tricks! Right... This song sadly is also too short.<br />Forest: 5/5 A very beautiful song! It's about a father granting his son a magical wish. Very catchy and it's one of the longer songs (4:00).<br />ATWA: 5/5 Another beautiful song! It's about Charles Manson! Yikes! It starts out very slow but just explodes at the chorus! Love the lyrics!<br />Science: 4/5 This song is about why science has ruined our world. I guess SOAD are kind of anti-nerds as well! Not very catchy but still great!<br />Shimmy: 4/5 The shortest song on the album (1:50) and that's the downside but it's still great. About the American education system.<br />Toxicty: 5/5 Another famous song and another of my top 3 favourites! It's also another beautiful song that begins slow but explodes! It's about the downside of city life such as noisy neighboures and disorder.<br />Psycho: 5/5 A quite grungy song. About cocaine addicted groupies and the idiotic people that want to see the rock concert still. Great work SOAD!<br />Aerials: 5/5 The last single and the album's most beautiful song! Another of my 3 favourite songs! Very emotional! It's about the circle of life. This is a somewhat depressing piece of music that was one of the first songs ever that brought me to tears almost. Very sad and very beautiful!<br />We're not done yet... THERE'S A HIDDEN TRACK!!!<br />Arto: Just like intros I never rate hidden tracks but this one is quite interesting. It's an Armenian tribal song named after an Armenian artist named Arto.<br />If you're looking for an awesome Nu-Metal album then rush out and buy Toxicity! Also buy all the System of a Down albums for some political Nu-Metal fun!! It's about a father granting his son a magical wish. Very catchy and it's one of the longer songs (4:00).

0800177177|5.0|\\"THE GREEN FAIRY WANTS YOUR SOUL\\"... I guess that sums it up. This movie is visually stunning. The special effects are simple and yet they look great.  Yes Dracula kills little babies for blood, he killed that annoying english lucy girl, he turns into strange night creatures...But who is the real bad guy of the story? Anthony Hopkins! why? if you notice he plays the orthodox priest in the beginning of the film who tells dracula Elizabetha is going to hell because she committed suicide, mortal sin. That triggers Dracula's wrath, but hey who can blame him? Then the priest seems to be reincarnated as vampire hunter Van Helsing who goes out of his way to stop Mina from reuniting with Dracula...He is the \\"evil guy\\" of a true love  story.  Keanu Reeves's acting is the comic relief of this dark film.
B000094A6A|5.0|Nothing great in the DVD that isn't in the movie, but that really doesn't matter with a classic comedy like this. Frank the Tank, Beanie, Blue, and Mitch combine to make this one of the funniest movies in recent memory.  I literally watched this 30 times since I bought it, and I laughed out loud every single time.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|\\"Sin City\\", Robert Rodriguez's \\"translation\\" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is, in more ways than one, like \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even \\"PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. \\"Sin City\\" also uses \\"Pulp Fiction's\\" method of combining several different stories into one movie.<br /><br />The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.<br /><br />The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.<br /><br />The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.<br /><br />The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />To put in simple terms, \\"Sin City\\" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well.

0385495323|5.0|Singh has penchant for unraveling the beauty of cryptography together with the intrigue of classified historical events. <br /> <br />He presents cyrptography as a tug of war between code breakers and code makers. <br /> <br />Starting with basic monoalphabetic substitution ciphers he shows how these were broken by the arabs using frequency analysis. <br /> <br />This led to the polyalphabetic ciphers which were eventually broken. <br /> <br />He delves into the impractical but unbreakable one time pad cipher and then the enigma apparatus explaining it in detail. <br /> <br />He hints at the key distribution problems which culminates in the discovery of asymmetric cryptography ( different keys for encryption and decryption ) and the public keys which are in widespread use today. <br /> <br />He concludes with a look at the future of cryptography...quantum cryptography. <br /> <br />Each concept is carefully and lucidly dealt with and a few exercises are provided at the end. <br /> <br />I was touched by his acknowledgement of many great cryptographers who for decades lived in anonymity never able to reveal their contributions. <br /> <br />
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is one of the most sensitively written books I've ever read (along with a Walk To Remember). Mitch Albom is one of my new favorite author's, I want to read the Five People You Meet In Heaven next.I've read reviews where people said they were crying through the whole thing, but it didn't get too sad for me until about the last 10 or 15 pages. I cried uncontrollably twice during those last few pages! I also thought the rest was very well written and Morrie will stick with me for years to come. He, along with Holden Caulfield and Atticus Finch is just one of those amazingly written characters that you feel like you know. Check this book out if you feel like having a good cry!
B0002VYOXQ|1.0|Okay first of all I would like to say that I have not been able to actually watch this edition since the copy I bought did not have the sound included.  I have no idea wether the sound is better or not.  The more general problem I have with this edition is the case and disc design.  SUPERBIT decided to plaster their logo all over both the cardboard case and the DVD case as well as the disc itself.  It seems to cheapen the overall package.  The greatest injustice is the fact that the disc is bright RED, exactly the opposite of everything to do with the movie.  If all that matters to you is the movie itself than feel free to ignore this.  I plan to return my copy and get a better designed case.
B000002KB8|3.0|First of all, I want to say that I like Black Sabbath--both their music, and as musicians. That being said, I take issue with those who say this album, as well as the first Led Zeppelin album, were the beginnings of heavy metal music, and that Sabbath were in a class by themselves with the style of music they supposedly invented. For one thing, there were plenty of lesser known American bands before them--such as the MC5, Blue Cheer, and The Frost--as well as contemporaries of theirs'--such as Mountain, the James Gang, Grand Funk Railroad, Frijid Pink, and Cactus--who on occasion did approach the intensity and ferosity of Sabbath's music. So any talk of Black Sabbath being musically exclusive for their time is completely ignorant of those facts. But then you might say it was the lyrical content--dealing with horror and the occult-- that set them apart from all the aforementioned groups. But even there, Sabbath wasn't necessarily alone, because there were others at the time, such as Bloodrock and Alice Cooper, who also dealt with frightening lyrical matter in every bit as gory detail as did Black Sabbath. In fact, the Alice Cooper group took it a step further by not only \\"playing\\" shocking music, but having a shocking stage presentation to go along with it! Whereas Sabbath were merely just a gang of harmless-looking, faceless hippies \\"only\\" playing high-decible \\"shock rock\\". Who would've looked at a photo of Osbourne, Ward, Iommi, and Butler in those days, and not confused them with a peace-loving west coast band like Canned Heat--until they heard them on stage! But there's what I really like best about Black Sabbath, and it's the same reason I preferred groups like the Yardbirds over The Who, and Aerosmith over KISS, and it was simply their \\"no frills\\" stage presence--just let the music do the shocking! Let's face it--Ozzy Osbourne in 1970 was anything but a charismatic leader. On stage, he just looked like a common, long-haired, juvenile delinquent with a voice forcow-calling, lucky to be in a band, standing in one spot on stage spitting out mythical lyrics from the pen of his mate, bassist Geezer Butler. He never pulled down his pants like Jim Morrison, cut his chest like Iggy Pop, or pretend to hang himself on stage like Alice Cooper. He didn't wear the flashy clothes of Mick Jagger, bear the sex appeal of Roger Daltrey, or have the vocal range of Robert Plant. Ozzy was as plain as the fan who bought the ticket to hear him, banging his head to-and-fro to the music just like his fans. And behind the heavy wall of sound and the stacks of amplifiers, Black Sabbath as a group was no more frightening than the little man behind the curtain on the \\"Wizard of Oz\\"--just four humble working-class boys from England, who had nothing flashy to offer but their music--and to that, I respect them.  <br />I suppose if I could think of one minor thing that set them apart from all their other previously mentioned contemporaries, from their first album onward, it would be nothing more than that de-tuned guitar sound of Tony Iommi--and without it, to me, Sabbath would have been no more different sounding than a Detroit garage band like The Frost or The Amboy Dukes. If anything about Sabbath \\"invented\\" Heavy metal as we know it today, it's that de-tuned, fuzzier-than-fuzz, guitar sound that Tony Iommi patented. Leslie West from Mountain, Mark Farner from Grand Funk, and Jimmy Page probably came close to Tony's guitar sound on occasion, but never as a stubbornly-adhered to sound, and never as part of the permanent formula of their bands' music as Black Sabbath's was. As far as Geezer Butler, that elderly-looking teenage bass player/wordsmith, I never thought much of his playing, although he had some creative moments on this album--particularly, on the final track. Bass players usually pride themselves on having a refined sound, and the raw, primitive sounds that emitted from Geezer's bass were somewhat unique. But the one guy in Sabbath I thinkis most underrated is the drummer, Bill Ward. And I think what separates Sabbath here from most \\"modern\\" heavy metal is the jazzy-drumming style that Bill Ward put out on the first two Sabbath albums. Ward wasn't really a \\"power\\" drummer, although he could exert power when the occasion called for it. He had more of a speed-and-finesse style like Mitch Mitchell from the Jimi Hendrix Experience, using a lot of snare, and it adds a touch of class to Tony's guitar and Geezer's bass, and made their sound what it was. Not bad for a former truck driver! <br /> <br />Now that I've introduced you to the band, how about this album? The sound and the lyrical content that they began on this album is the formula that they've held on to to this day, and throughout the years with Ozzy. Except for a few times when their blues roots become exposed (more like \\"third hand\\" blues, the way Tony Iommi played it here. His phrasing at times was more directly from Eric Clapton, than the men who influenced Clapton. If Clapton \\"butchered\\" the original blues, then Tony Iommi \\"butchered the butcherer\\"!) as well as the two medlies that are more like improvisational jams that run into each other (although its hard to tell when one stops and the other begins)  for the most part, you've heard this album, you've heard every other album Sabbath put out until 1975. And that's not necessarily a bad thing--it just shows that they discovered their own sound early on. But again, just because they had their own sound doesn't mean they invented the whole genre of music known as Heavy Metal. Perhaps the most dated-sounding song on here is \\"Wicked World\\", with more hippie-lyrical concerns and Ozzy's voice distorted to sound like Ian Anderson, the song sounds more like an outtake from Tony's previous band, Jethro Tull--the only thing making it sound like Sabbath at all, of course, being Tony's guitar. But Tony's guitar sound was really the only thing that ever made them sound unique through the years. Not thelyrics, not the intensity of the other band members, certainly not Ozzy's singing, and certainly not the charisma the band exuded on stage, because they had none. It was nothing more than that de-tuned fuzz guitar that thickened the sound of heavy metal forever, and it's as simple as that.

B000A3VTT8|5.0|When I was about six years old, this opera was on my local public television station. My parents taped it on our new VCR (it was the early 80's - the VCR was a big deal). It had an easy story - what little girl doesn't know Cinderella? The music was catchy. Frederica von Stade's voice and sincerity were captivating. The production didn't look like the other operas on TV - like it was being shouted out on stage - but more like a movie. As I watched, I fell in love not only with these singers, not only with this opera, not only with Rossini, but with a whole genre of music. I watched the video dozens of times over the next 20-odd years, as the tape grew blurry with age. I'm delighted that it's finally out on DVD, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a small girl interested in classical music.
B000002UAO|5.0|I took a look at what CDs my sister had. I never really liked the Beatles but when I heard this album, my mind changed. It's pretty great. If you dislike The Beatles, this album will surely change your opinion. \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\" was the best songs of this album. I enjoyed it very much.
B000AYQLX6|5.0|I have been awaiting the release of Walls & Bridges in a NEW remastered & remixed edition and HERE/HEAR IT IS!  I am OVER the MOON listening to the new version.  The production team did a FANTASTIC job remastering and remixing.  It is wonderful to discover all the sparkling nuances of the album.  Great separation and balance, highs and lows, the sounds now leap out of my speakers.  I am overjoyed by hearing one of my favourite Lennon albums in a cleaned up enhanced manner.  Top marks!
0316168815|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a book that I would normally never read.  It deals with rape and murder, which are two things I really don't look for in a book.  I knew at some point that I should broaden my horizons on genres and after reading the back of \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" I knew it was the book to read.   <br />     The first chapter was the hardest for me to deal with because that's the chapter that tells the reader about the rape and murder.  Alice Sebold does a very nice job with the description of this scene and uses very good descriptions throughout the entire novel.   <br />      I loved how Alice Sebold also used very different emotions for all of the characters and showed how they all interacted, such as the father seeking revenge, the mother coping with the loss of a daughter, the sister finding love, and the brother feeling neglected.  It's interesting to see how this family is so entangled with emotions and how they try to break their barriers with one another to get at the core of their feelings.   <br />     I also liked the fact that this book is never boring.  You stay on the edge of your seat and wonder how things are going to turn out.  You pray that the killer is found.  You hope that the Salmon family can reunite and help each other out.  You wish that Susie felt some sort of peace while watching Mother Earth from heaven.  <br />     All and all, I enjoyed this book and liked the fact that I found joy in reading a book that I never would usually read.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.

B000CPGZHA|5.0|Living in the US, we have been deprived of this fantastic artists off and on for nearly 20 years.  Kylie is a class-act and is as popular, if not more, than Madonna is almost every other country in the world.

From the opening number, to her finale, Kylie gives her fans everthing they would expect and more.
0780021967|5.0|IN A NUTSHELL: Don't be put off by the first five minutes!  <br /> <br />This is one sneaky thriller. At first it seems so slow and trite, almost ancient in its context, until suddenly, the momentum and urgency really builds-up. We see the first brillant execution on film by Hitchcock of the wrong man, fugitive on the run with a bomb ticking in his pocket scenario, and it all works. We have the train, knife in back, police, escapes from police, female loyalty, the wrong man, irony, satire and, an abundance of English and Scottish countryside settings. A sort of English version of \\"North-by-Northwest\\" or \\"East-by-Northwest\\". However, \\"39 Steps\\" does give the appearance of a film made a long time ago, which is probably its biggest departure from \\"North-by-Northwest\\". Naturally, I could not imagine \\"39 Steps\\" filmed in color. As an oddity, there was an early prototype of a helicopter during the manhunt scene across the Scottish landscape and it was a surprise in this 1935 film - a big surprise. Checking it out again, I have concluded that the helicopter must have been a minature, though I am not absolutely positive.  <br /> <br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT: PACE - PLOT - TICKING TIME BOMB + ACCIDENTAL ROMANCE  <br /> <br />Richard Hannay [Robert Donat] basically has a girl with a knife in her back after an evening of intrigue and paranoia. But, obviously this woman, Annabella really is in danger since after all she is now dying with a knife in her back. As a suspect, and fugitive, in the same spirit as Roger O. Thornhill [Carey Grant] from \\"North by Northwest\\", Richard Hannay takes to the rails and the countryside to a spot on the dead girl's map. He knows a little but there is too much he does not know, like who his potential enemies might be which of course could be fatal. Naturally, after avoiding the police and almost getting caught several times, Hannay, with the reluctant help of a radiant blond, Pamela [Madeleine Carroll] slowly gets to the bottom of this intrigue. There is intrigue, comedy, accidental romance and most of all suspense --- EVER GROWING SUSPENSE. The climax of the film is set essentially where it began in what is one neatly and tightly plotted thriller.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE ACTORS: Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat  <br /> <br />The two leads, Robert Donat as Richard Hannay, and Madeleine Carroll as Pamela are rather reminiscent both physically and as characters, to Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall. There is even one very provocative scene where Pamela, takes here stockings off to dry by the fire, while Richard's hand is still handcuffed to her's as she peels down her stockings. This was filmed very slowly and close-up, which by 1935 standards is rather risque, and which identifies her clearly as quite a romantic female lead. A little later, still handcuffed, the pair are actually sleeping in the same bed, albeit not under the sheets or completely undressed. When Pamela does manage to get free of the handcuffs, she participates in a plot development which her regained freedom allows, and then returns to bed. Only this time, at the foot of the bed, since she is no longer forced by the handcuffs to be in the same bed as Richard. This plotting probably allowed them to get by the censors. Similarly, now no longer bound by cuffs, she replaces her stockings without the company of the camera, as if to again demonstrate the necessity for the provocative close-up shown earlier.  <br /> <br />\\"39 STEPS\\" -- AHEAD OF ITS TIME:  <br /> <br />There are many modern devices used in this film with great effect. To name a few;  <br /> <br />-- Extensive mixing and combining of matte backgrounds, minatures and the real thing, to increase realism and the illusion of a multitude of different exterior settings over a wide expanse. This includes waterfalls, sheep herds blocking traffic to allow hero and heroine to escape, varied scottish and english countrysides from trains, cars and on foot and numerous interior destinations from these hair-raising jaunts.  <br /> <br />-- The idea that military secrets and Englands air defense in particular could be threatened and that the consequences implied were truly dire. This at a time when most air-forces including Englands and Germany's were comprised of short range, slow-moving bi-planes, with some monoplanes on the drawing boards.  <br /> <br />-- Very subtle, seemingly accidental sexuality and romance without the appearance of being nominal or gratuitous woven into the plot.  <br /> <br />--Plus, unreliable narrators, improbable behavior, dumb-luck [good and bad] and the intervention of nice people, like the couple that ran the inn or the woman that gave Richard her husbands overcoat and an escape opportunity from the police.  <br /> <br />All of the above transfers into 83 minutes of fast-paced drama and comedy, action, danger, romance and sexuality. And in the end, the film goes right back to where it began, which illustrates that nothing in this film is gratuitous or wasteful. Truly a 5-Star effort by Alfred Hitchcock, plus his find cast and production team.  <br /> <br />-----CAST  <br /> <br />Robert Donat - Richard Hannay  <br />Madeleine Carroll - Pamela  <br />Godfrey Tearle - Prof. Jordan  <br />Lucie Mannheim - Miss Smith/Annabella  <br />Wylie Watson - Mr. Memory  <br /> <br />-----PRODUCTION CREW  <br /> <br />Alfred Hitchcock - Director  <br />Michael Balcon - Producer  <br />Ivor Montagu - Producer  <br />Charles Bennett - Screenwriter  <br />John Buchan - Book Author  <br />Ian Hay - Screenwriter  <br />Alma Reville - Screenwriter  <br />Bernard Knowles - Cinematographer  <br />Louis Levy - Composer (Music Score)  <br />Derek N. Twist - Editor  <br /> <br /> <br />ABOUT THE VIDEO: Get the \\"Criterion\\" DVD release  <br /> <br />The version I viewed was on video and it had many issues that detracted from the viewing experience such as, fuzzy images, blurry sound, artifacts and flutter in the picture, which did vary somewhat in intensity throughout the film. It seems like this film would be worth getting on DVD from \\"Criterion\\" despite the higher cost.  <br /> <br />ALSO CONSIDER SEEING:  <br /> <br />The 39 Steps (1959, Ralph Thomas)  <br />North By Northwest (1959, Alfred Hitchcock)  <br />Silver Streak (1976, Arthur Hiller)  <br />The Fugitive (1993, Andrew Davis)  <br /> <br />
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is an underrated album, like many others have said.  This was one of the last zeppelin albums I bought, and it grew on me as I have aged.  It's lyrical themes are a little more subtle than the testosterone filled \\"whole lotta love,\\" or \\"black dog,\\" making it one of my preferred zeppelin choices nowadays.  Don't get me wrong II and IV are great albums, but \\"presence\\" is more complex lyrically speaking (e.g. \\"for your life\\")and fun to listen to when you want a more funky, mellow sound.  But if you wanna rock, \\"achilles last stand,\\" and \\"nobody's fault but mine,\\" won't disappoint.  <br /> <br />     This album explores the funk side of zeppelin, evident in jones and page's play in \\"candy store rock\\", \\"royal orleans\\", and \\"hots for nowhere\\".  These tracks also exhibit some of the band's sense of humor, the lyrics don't necessarily take themselves so seriously.  Plant's has lost some of his range by this album, but this works well with the funk tracks in that it smoothes them out a little bit.   <br />  <br />     I'd have to say my favorite blues track by zeppelin has become \\"tea for one\\".  This song with the production of the album reminds me of some of the slower blues tracks stevie ray vaughn would later record.  It is a fantastic display of Page's talent rooted in blues.  Along with Plant's more mellow singing style, this song is nine minutes of paradise.
B000001ESJ|5.0|A Farewell To Kings came out in 1977 and was Rush's first album to achieve Gold status (2112 was right after). It was 2112's follow-up, and a good one at that. <br /> <br />The only album that pleases ME more than this one is the one that follows it (read my Hemispheres review). Together these two albums are the best things I own (IMO, you may prefer my Dark Side of The Moon or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but these are my favorites). <br /> <br />It may not be for the first time Rush listener.... <br /> <br />but if you like rock music then you WILL buy this. I guarantee positive results. <br /> <br />If you are a Rush virgin, no harm done. Closer To The Heart should be the first thing on this album that touches your ears. I consider this their signature song. It shows what they are capable of musically and shows what they are about lyrically (this may be the first time Neil finally steps away from his Randian roots). I LOVE this guitar solo. <br /> <br />You could listen to Cinderella Man next for just an average rock song that is probably the most accessible thing here. Madrigal should also be listened to at this time. This song is short and soft. It can be very pretty if you are in the mood. <br /> <br />Now your ears may be ready for my favorite -8 minute song, the title track. This song never ceases to amaze me. It starts with a time-changing classical guitar into a majestic loud riff pounding. Then the riff speeds up into another riff that leads into the verse. The verse then leads into the most satisfying chorus I have yet to experience. OMG I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!! This song is basically about the concept of the album (if there is one) it's about talking absolute rulers out of power and making the society closer to the heart (there you go). <br /> <br />Once you have gulped that enough try on the album's epic centerpiece, Xanadu. This song is impossible to describe except to say that it changes pace a lot and it's about a guy who searches for immortal life at the price of not being able to live it (or at least that's what i got from it). <br /> <br />The final gulp is the lead-in to the next album, Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage. It's my favorite song on this album and one of my favorite songs that are between 8 and 12 minutes. It is about a black hole. My favorite part is when it speeds up into the 1-4-2-5 chord progression and Geddy Lee sings so high you can barely hear him. It is quite amazing. For effect, I highly reccomend listening to this and right at the end when the chords fade out listen to Hemispheres. It is the perfect transition. (They probably did it on purpose). <br /> <br />You need the album...
B00003CXDB|5.0|The ambience of the Reagan-era stock boom is captured perfectly in this iconic film, starring Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, and Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />The younger Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young up-and-coming stockbroker who worms his way into the heart of darkness of Wall Street mogul Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who seduces the younger man into a lifestyle of stylish excess.<br /><br />Martin Sheen plays Charlie's father, a role he reprised from real life. In WALL STREET the elder Sheen is an airline mechanic and union man to the cuffs of his coveralls who tries desperately to make his bedazzled son hold fast to bedrock blue-collar values.<br /><br />Although the ethics lesson is heavy-handed and obvious, WALL STREET's closing moral is satisfyingly vague and open to interpretation, giving this film an unintended depth that still draws audiences two decades later.<br /><br />Douglas's Gekko is the avaricious embodiment of the Gimme Decade, believing that, from start to finish as the great tagline to this movie says, \\"Greed is good...Greed works.\\" Director Oliver Stone named Gekko after the infamous \\"f.u. lizard\\" of Vietnam, and it's an appropriate choice. Gekko, as the embodiment of a kind of ethical darkness, has much in common with APOCALYPSE...NOW's Colonel Kurtz (another Sheen vehicle). He is eminently piratical, dismembering companies, enemies and sexual conquests (Daryl Hannah plays the girl) gloatingly.<br /><br />Smudging the seemingly simple lines drawn in the sand, Douglas's Oscar-winning portrayal is so overwhelmingly powerful that it effectively capsizes the movie and inverts the lesson in ethics. The mesmerizing, beautifully polished Gekko, reeking of amorality, becomes a study in the Will to Power.<br /><br />Gekko, quite ironically, is The Man We All Want To Be. His strength however, comes less from within himself than from his ability to tap into the egocentric desires of others around him. Never promising anything, like a magician he demonstrates everything, exuding authority and certainty in that most uncertain and least authoritative of all universes, finance. Generations of MBAs, CFPs, and hungry young men of all stripes have seen WALL STREET as a McGuffey's Reader of sorts, providing a template for the look, tone, and attitude of success. Events have not proven them wrong.<br /><br />Even as the sycophants around him disgustingly reduce everything to a crude dollars-and-cents cost-benefit analysis (take note of Daryl Hannah's reaction to Gekko's tacky modern art collection), Gekko seems to be above it all. True, he exhibits the predatory instincts of an alley cat throughout the picture, but he is also undeniably alluring. Whether Douglas is portraying the hero or the villain of WALL STREET depends entirely on the viewer's perspective and mood.t most uncertain and least authoritative of all universes, finance.

B00005JMXX|3.0|IN A NUTSHELL: DOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT THIS IS \\"REEL-EE\\" BAD SCIENCE? <br /> <br />Did it matter that \\"Independence Day\\" by the same Director had even less of a connection with possible future scenarios? NO, but \\"Independence Day\\" did not rely so heavily on special effects [though it was full of them] and therein lies part of the difference. \\"Independence Day\\" also had a unique chemistry that seemed to give it a connection to 50's-style, alien-invader flicks, thereby cultivating an affinity from those fans --including me.  <br /> <br />After all, does \\"Superman\\" [the \\"good alien invader\\"] need to be believable? - - - - -  <br />DOES STAR WARS NEED TO BE GOOD SCIENCE TO BELIEVE IN THE FILMS? DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE FORCE?  <br /> <br />Of course, the science is ridiculous in almost all of these speculative fiction flicks. Remember this is Hollywood film fiction and this fictional account is not \\"Gone With The Wind\\". On the other hand, I found \\"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW\\" to be so much more watchable than \\"Men In Black\\" which suffered from an excess of humourous, flashy, fanciful, madcap, silly, glib and goofy moods to be watchable for me.  <br /> <br />This film appears to be trying at least to make a go of it. By that I mean making the unbelievable less, well, unbelievable. Dennis Quaid as a scientist-husband-father does well to keep us connected emotionally to the horrific events lending some much needed empathy to this spectacle. Ian Holm as the Brittish scientist is, well, Ian Holm; which is to say he always turns in a top-notch performance and his sequences are much needed in making the most unscientific theories work well enough to partially suspend our disbelief -- hopefully for at least 123 minutes.  <br /> <br />Going against the film is the obvious post-9/11 sentiment, making the destruction of American cities, shown principally to American audiences, somewhat worse than politically incorrect. To some people it may have seemed like rape victims watching a rapestory movie, very sordid, but I did not realize that until I heard it from other people. Perhaps because I did not see the film until over 3 years after 9/11? If that is the case, the destruction of cities may be less offensive if you are NOW seeing the film for the first time, but that is just speculation.  <br /> <br />THE DVD & FEATURES  <br /> <br />Despite its inherent flaws, it plays somewhat interestingly, especially in this widescreen format. You can play it in \\"English\\", Spanish\\", and French\\" and there are subtitles available in English or Spanish. If you want the \\"DTS Surround Sound\\" this is available in English only. There are also some neat features like 2 separate commentary tracks and an hour-long featurette [\\"the making of\\"]. Of course there is the scene-selector feature and there are enough scenes that you won't have trouble getting to where you wish to go. There are also \\"deleted scenes\\" and an \\"audio anatomy-interactive sound demo\\".  <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br /> <br />The sound and video quality are great, which is as it should be on a new, high-budget release. The film is bad science, \\"reel\\" bad science, but it does retain a decent, and spectacular story, though more than a bit ridiculous. Ridiculous sometimes works in fantasy, though it is a bit harder sell in science fiction. In any event, the choice is up to us, the movie viewing public.  <br /> <br />Recently, this DVD has been heavily discounted and is now available widely for about half the original price, or about $10.00. <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|I don't know why people are saying such hurtfull things about britney. It must make them feel better or whatever. She has great music, she is sexy and she is only human. why are people calling her slutty. she works hard for her body so why not show it off. mabey people are just jeolous.

B00006CXSS|5.0|As a long-time war movie fan, I give this set the highest rating. BAND OF BROTHERS is so well done that it will set the standard for other war movies for years to come. This 6-disk set has excellent audio & video, a top knotch ensemble cast, world class co-producers (Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks who also collaborated on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), and a exceptional soundtrack.<br /><br />The story is based on Stephen Ambrose's best selling book by the same title.  The acting and the script give the best portrayal I've seen of the close ties that develop among combat troops during wartime. The last \\"chapter\\" of the set, WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER, is a must see documentary in and of itself.  It shows survivors of the combat unit (Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) reflecting on their actual experiences that the DVD set portrays.  It's dramatic, funny, poignant, and insightful.  I LOVE the ending.<br /><br />To maximize your enjoyment of this set, I recommend that you (1) watch it on a large screen high definition TV with a surround sound system, (2) read Ambrose's book, and (3) buy the soundtrack and listen to it often.
B000BWI9U0|2.0|this album is a Make up for the 2nd album which was pretty bland.the strokes this time around go for that smooth&Polished vibe which is cool if that is where you are at,but it doesn't leave them much room for any kind of Growth.the instrumentation is cool,but there aren't any real knock out type of songs.the Strokes seemed to be on to something a few years back,but now they have settled for making that run at the Brass ring,but while they have plenty of shine here,there isn't alot musical glow.
B00007ELEL|5.0|JEFF BRIDGES AS \\"THE DUDE\\" IS ALWAYS ON  <br /> <br /> <br />IN A NUTSHELL: REFRESHING THOUGH UNORTHODOX WAY TO SPIN A GOOD YARN - BUT THERE'S LOT'S MORE:  <br /> <br />\\"The Big Lebowski\\" was a delight to watch. After the first five minutes, everything began to make perfect sense. The \\"Dude\\" turned out to be a very unlikely hero in what was a very unexpected string of vignettes that altogether made a delightful film experience.  <br /> <br />Jeff Bridges as The Dude is always 'ON' in a very disarming way. His integrity of character through all the bizarre twists and turns of this story is what holds the film together and makes this unlikely yarn somehow quite believable.  <br /> <br />OF COURSE \\"THE DUDE'S\\" GOT FRIENDS:  <br /> <br />John Goodman as \\"Walter Sobchak\\" is quite a handful and is responsible for the plot thickening the third time, or is that the fourth? Goodman portrays the misunderstood Vietnam Vet who needs The Dude to be his co-dependent, but has found in The Dude someone even more dysfunctional than himself. Walter has a problem insofar as understanding that violence is not always cool. He seems to like guns with a leaning toward automatic weapons. RESULT = OOPS!  <br /> <br />In the mess that ensues, we have pretend kidnappings or are they real? We have a trophy wife for an old disabled man in a wheelchair. We have bowling -- very serious bowling. We have angry people roughly demanding money from The Dude and urinating on his carpet, setting the whole fable in motion.  <br /> <br />SOMEHOW ALL THESE GRAND VIGNETTES MAKE A REALLY COOL MOVIE:  <br /> <br />Add to this Nihilists, a police chief, actors, weird art, strange people, The \\"Stranger\\" and bizarre motivations and you get one heck of a movie. We even have detectives following The Dude and somehow in awe of just how incredible he is! Through all this and a series of little skits that altogether make a movie, The Dude tries to hold it all together, to get a replacement rug, and to do the right thing. Somehow The Dude gets it right in the end.  <br /> <br />To sum up, this film works on many levels and is a very refreshing though unorthodox way to spin a good yarn. Check it out and see if you agree!  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD:  <br /> <br />Excellent widescreen transfer.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JMJG|5.0|IN A NUTSHELL - <br /> <br />DR. MIERZWIAK says \\"TECHNICALLY SPEAKING - IT IS BRAIN DAMAGE\\" - BUT ITS A SUPERB DRAMA <br /> <br />Jim Carrey does very well in this highly unusual drama. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk \\"Special Edition\\".  <br /> <br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:  <br /> <br />The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, \\"Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking.\\" The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.  <br /> <br />So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD:  <br /> <br />The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new \\"2-disk Special Edition\\" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.  <br /> <br />If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk \\"Special Edition\\" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.  <br /> <br />OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGS  <br /> <br />My daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time. See what you think!  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000BNTM96|4.0|this is definately a must have for any QOTSA fans. they play stuff off of every album but play more off of the s/t and songs for the deaf than anything else. luckily they don't play much off of rated r (that album is definately the weak link). the sound quality is fantastic so don't be worried about that. it's got a bunch of bonus stuff when nick was still in the band.  <br /> <br />the only reason why i only gave this 4 stars is because it was basically only one show with only one line up. i really would have liked to get better recordings (and better camera angles) of their older shows. oh well. <br /> <br />hopefully a kyuss dvd will eventually make it's way to shelves.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Well I have to say that the first time that I listened to this album, I was a little bit disappointed. <br /> <br />Maybe it's because there wasn't a lot of songs on this (only eleven including the two translations). \\"Something\\" (\\"En Tus Pupilas'\\" translation) and \\"The Day And The Time\\" (\\"Dia Especial's\\" translation) are not as good as their Spanish versions in my opinion. <br /> <br />The songs that I prefer are \\"How Do You Do\\" and \\"Timor\\". Here we have meaningful songs where Shakira isn't afraid of expressing herself.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think it's a good album but a little bit too short, it would have been better if Volume 1 and Volume 2 had had been packed together.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|As a gay man AND a fan of country music, I am absolutely thrilled with this soundtrack, which is all I could hope for and more.  The instrumental pieces are hauntingly beautiful, and certainly have me re-living the experience of the film each time I play it.  Of course, this is what a good soundtrack should do.  I intend to see the film again shortly to see how all the music fits in, now that I have so much if it in my mind.<br /><br />While I am particularly delighted with the participation of Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris - both of who are among my favorite country artists - there are some wonderful surprises in the soundtrack.  Rufus Wainwright also scores big - real big - with his stunning version of the gospel / love song, The Maker Makes, and his King of the Road is not as out-of-place as some reviewers have suggested (and yes, the song is heard - albeit briefly - on the actual soundtrack of the film, but it is the original version by Roger Miller and not the re-recording that is used in the movie).  As stunningly beautiful as \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" (Emmylou Harris) and poignant as Willie Nelson's rendition of the Bob Dylan's \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" are - and they are both great - I must admit that the winner may very well be Teddy Thomson's I Don't Want To Say Goodbye, a gorgeous ballad written and performed in a traditional country style, complete with a haunting fiddle and steel guitar.  The achingly romantic lyrics are a capsule snapshot of the overwhelming themes of the film - that love is not always found where we expect to find it, and one cannot chose where the heart will lead.<br /><br />Ditto for the upbeat but heartbreaking rendition of I Will Never Let You Go by Jackie Green.<br /><br />Most of the music is extremely appropriate for a love story - and even more so, a gay love story, which Brokeback Mountain most definitely is.  And the few songs that arguably do not evoke a love story certainly evoke images of cowboys and the West.  While these characters may not reflect my life (an urban gay man) they speak for thousands of gay men throughout history who have had to silence themselves even when they could not silence their feelings.  These are two people who would have had a great life to compliment their great love, if only society did not make them ashamed of their feelings, and force them to hide in the shadows of a closet.  Their story is a tragedy in every sense of the word, and the music could not have been more thoughtfully laid out or more effective.<br /><br />Highly recommended.he West.

037571457X|5.0|I must commend Satrapi for two reasons. The first is that she has created a memoir of an unpleasant era without being overly sentimental or self-indulgent, and secondly, her Persepolis books have established the Graphic Novel as a serious literary art form. I had been waiting years to see comics taken seriously, or at least for Graphic Novels to land on the bestseller shelves. Persepolis has done both.
0380789019|5.0|I was on my way to work on a dreary Saturday moring. The office was empty. I was the only one in that day. I finished the last page of the book in the lobby and went upstairs. I kept thinking i was seeing images of shadows walking in the empty hallways of the office and through doors of darkened offices , my hair stood up and I LOVED IT!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Needless to say - if you read this and American Gods it's safe to say you will read everthying that comes out of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> <br />It is  rael, it is now it is everywhere!
B000AARKOO|4.0|I have always been an enthusiast of Ridley Scott's movie.  Every frames are picture perfect and Ridley himself even remarked jokingly that he's been categorised as a visualist (looks good but no substance).  Despite that this movie is better viewed in the cinema, the second dic with the extra features are exemplary in this instance.  There are two substantial documentaries that allow the viewers to understand deeper about the Crusades, comparing the facts against the fiction, getting a glimpse of the thoughts and reflections of the actors and actresses, planning process, production process and so forth.  In many other DVD compilation, we would have behind the scene extra which is more like a promotional material but not here, where all documentaries have gotten substance to them.  The movie is very relevant in today's situation where Muslims are still proclaiming jihad towards the infidels and Christians (in the form of USA with its supporters) invade and occupy Iraq and now, talking about exerting its muscle power towards Syria and Iran.  Then, there's the problem spot itself, Jerusalem where Muslims are still fending themselves or exerting themselves against the might of the Jews and the Christians.  The movie's intent is obvious.  It's actually an anti-war movie that believes in forward thinking leadership and resolving conflict towards dialogues and working together as shown by King Baldwin and Salahuddin.  Can you imagine President Bush and Osama coming face to face and working through an uneasy alliance?  This movie is different from The Gladiators because the focus is never on Maximus but about Jerusalem itself.  Characters that are featured in the movie form the total sum of the movie.  The whole time sitting through the movie, it never comes to me that it's about Balian but about conflicting and amiable personalities that either work against or for one another.  Don't take my word for it but this movie is a grand epic and very well-executed.  God is in details and from little subtle hints given in the picture shots, we get to understand the society, the philosophy, the costume, the diet, the geography  , the architecture, the warefare and its weaponary of its time.  The gesture of Salahuddin picking up a fallen cross and putting it right on the table mindfully is a very potent symbol of his respect and tolerance of other religion.  The movie brings forth a point that some people use religion for the greater good and some people hide behind the facade or religion to garner power and influence.  Once they are corrupted by power, they are incorrigible and would start committing evil.  It's quite remarkable that one of the Ten Commandments is Thou Shall Not Kill and yet, people can't still abide by TEN simple Commandments.  A memorable movie that anyone should have in their collections.  Highly recommended.  I'm really saddened by the fact that it didn't do well in the box-office.  Perhaps, it's due to people's denial of the inherent message in the movie, a movie that shows a more humane side of the Muslims, where the American market can't and won't accept right now especially when their sons and daughters are fighting a war that doesn't belong to them.
B00081U6EG|5.0|This was a great concert.  George Harrison and Jimi Hendrix didn't make it to the show.  Please excuse them - they're dead. <br />Hank Marvin, Gary Moore, Paul Rogers, Joe Walsh, David Gilmour, and Ronnie Wood did make it to the show.  A very nice variety for a concert even if some of the older performers are showing their age.  The critics here have expressed their rage at this not having been a nonstop Fender Bender guitar extravaganza.  They would probably be more at home at a Green Day concert. <br />
0307276902|1.0|Other reviewers writing that \\"true or false, it doesn't matter\\" are scary moral relativists. Their thinking is as much a product of the Age Of Bush as the Iraq war, the Medicare debacle, the Katrina response, ad nauseam. Black is white, up is down, helping means hurting, and on and on.     This book is for the koolaid drinkers too silly to recognize a gutless, soulless lack of integrity when it's slapping them in the face.    This is like writing rejected from a freshman creative writing class. James Frey's prose is not innovative, fresh or even clear. His use of literary devices is junior high school-level. If you've got half a brain, you'll see right through the fake \\"tough guy\\" persona. I felt mostly embarrassed for him. It's only saving grace was that it was supposed to be true, not \\"emotionally true.\\" Now that it lacks even truth, who cares?
B000E33VWW|5.0|Believe me when I tell you that this is one of the best films of the year. It is a complex and multi-layered work of art. Truman Capote, under assignment from the New Yorker magazine, explores a terrible murder of a family of four in the American heartland. He asks his childhood friend from Monroeville Alabama, Nelle Harper Lee, to act as his assistant and together they will explore the murder and its impact on the community for a magazine article. Phillip Seymour Hoffman delivers the acting performance of the year playing the role of the cognitively unique Capote. Catherine Keener was superb playing the solid strength of Harper Lee. <br /> <br />When the killers are soon caught and Capote sees the half-Native American Perry Smith, an odd chemistry develops and Capote becomes obsessed with Smith. Yet Capote manipulates the two murderers and even pays for their first court appeal in order to obtain more information for the article that has now developed into a book. Clifton Collins is excellent in the role of Perry Smith and Chris Cooper is excellent as the head of the Kansas division of the FBI. <br /> <br />Capote had a rare gift, the ability to make himself totally vulnerable through painful self revelation, so as to obtain entry into soul of his target. He does this with Smith and they begin a careful relationship whereby they reveal themselves to each other like chess players, each making careful calculated moves so as to obtain the maximum amount of information and manipulation of the other party. <br /> <br />Harper Lee confronts Capote asking whether he has fallen in love with Perry Smith, but Capote says that he and Smith are the same person, only Capote ran out the 'front door' and Smith ran out the 'back door\\". <br /> <br />Capote names his book \\"In Cold Blood\\" but keeps this information from Perry Smith. Eventually you begin to realize that cold blood is the mental state that Capote had to assume to manipulate the killers long enough to extract the full story of the murders from them. <br /> <br />As the book nears completion, Capote begins a mental breakdown. He may actually love Perry Smith and thus regrets his death but also he knows the execution must occur to bring closure to the book so it can be published. Thus when Capote wishes Smith to die he is cast into guilt and grief; but when he wishes Smith to live, he is cast into depression over the lack of closure of his masterpiece. <br /> <br />One of the most wise plot devices in this film was to contrast the fall of Capote with the rise of Harper Lee and her wonderful novel \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".  Capote sinks into depression and alcoholism laced with mounting self pity while Harper Lee gains acclaim first for her novel and then for the film starring Gregory Peck. On the night of the gala opening of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" Capote attends the festivities in a drunken depressed stupor and is so self absorbed that he can't even offer his supportive best friend, Lee, congratulations on her novel and film. <br /> <br />What do we make of this film?  It is incredibly well done and demonstrates that no act of mercy is totally pure, no act of cruelty is totally evil.  It was Capote's incredible skills that allowed him to manipulate the killers to gain the story that made him the most famous American living writer; but he sold his soul to buy the story and he never recovered from the wound. <br /> <br />This is mature film-making at its best!
B00005JNTX|4.0|After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.  For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.
0307276902|1.0|First off:  I still have not read this book.  I purchased it.  Right here, in fact.  But something about seeing Mr. Frey on Oprah just didn't ring true.  His mannersisms and responses, the description of the scene on the plane covered in blood, urine and vomit (ya, they're gonna let passengers on a plane in that condition).   <br /> <br />I read most of Oprah's books - just couldn't bring myself to get around to his. Now I find out that my gut feeling was right on.  Mr. Frey didn't write a memoir, he wrote a mostly fictional account of a life which, for some unimaginable and unfortunate reason, he WISHED he had lived.  I have no interest in reading a fictional memoir.  I'd like my money back!   <br /> <br />One of the sad results of this deception is that Oprah, while in good faith presenting a book as truth and thereby making millions for the author, has been made to look as though she's been taken for a ride.  Which evidently, she has.  Hopefully no one will waste time making this piece of (mostly) fiction into a non-memoir of a movie.
0307276902|3.0|What the public needs to be aware of is that there are TRUE story accounts of persons whose stories are either equally, more or less horrendous than Mr. Frey's.. 100% REAL accounts of persons who lived/recovered and was restored to sanity and are now LIVING MIRACLES...  <br /> <br />A gamut of folk who are now lawyers, doctors, nurses, clerks and whomever in between.. you name it! <br /> <br />In recovery circles, the only difference is, CONFIDENTIALITY is foremost in their stories as they live and work side by side with you and me...  <br /> <br />In contrast, their \\"millions gained\\" from their unpublished stories shine as gold beacons and resonate in their ability to live clean lives and share their personal examples to the thousands, if not millions of addicts and their loved ones suffering worldwide..   <br /> <br />what the book does is it gives hope to families. friends and their loved ones suffering from addiction. i love a particular saying in recovery circles: THE LIE IS DEAD, WE DO RECOVER.. <br /> <br />Embelishment, lies, whatever...while I wished that author conveyed a 100% accurate account of his journey, Mr. Frey DID bring to light (for the public view) the miracle of recovery... 12 step or not; NA, AA OR Hazeldon; he DID recover didn't he????? I ain't mad at him.
0446577383|4.0|I truely enjoyed this story about conspiracy and murder.  I originally bought this book because I love the author's writing, but was not too sure I would enjoy the subject.  This story is based on terrorists and the Secret Service.  I have a relative that works for the Secret Service and was not sure I would enjoy reading about possible terrorist attacks.  The story is wonderful.  It is also nice to realize that the author felt free enough to write about terrorists, especially after 9/11.  I would recommend this book if you enjoy reading about conspiracies within the government and/or about murders.  If you want to read this book, I recommend you set aside some time to read because I found I could not put the book down once I began it.
0763628182|5.0|Ages 3 and older will relish this scary pop-up title which is recommended for parent acquisition, as it probably won't withstand the rigors of library lending unless it's used as a display on a top shelf. Haunted House opens with a spooky pop-up staircase and moves to cover monsters and even an octopus in the bathroom. It arrived too late for Halloween mention but deserves pick as a 'keeper' for next year.
0316666343|5.0|I am an avid reader and I have to say this book is by far one of the best I have ever read. This book really captures not only the reader attention but their heart. <br /> <br />It is about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who was walking home from school and was lured by her neighbor, into a manhole and was raped in murderd. Susie goes to heaven and looks down as her family, friends, and neighbors are trying to cope with her dissaperance and finally her death. I like the way this story was written and it had nothing to do with \\"god\\" even though it mentions heaven, because not everyone believe in or worships \\"god\\", and it makes this story readable for everyone. The way this story is told is brilliant and captivating. I would recommend it to anyone in highschool and up. Its the kind of story i think everyone needs to read. <br />
0307276902|1.0|Just bought the book because it was suppose to be real and now I have learned it is fiction. I will return this as there are many authors out there who write very good stories and dont get publicity but if you write a book of lies you become a millionaire. I guess thats why all the dishonest are at the top!
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album has everything a great album should. \\"Out of Exile\\" has everything from classical rock, \\"Doesn't remind Me\\", to hard, fast rock, \\"Man or Animal\\" to slow rock, \\"Heaven's Dead\\". I personally think every song on this cd kicks ass.  If you get this album, be prepared to sit for hours on end listening to it. Drums are slow but hard in \\"The Curse\\" which is defenitly the best song on the album. \\"Out of Exile\\" is ten times better than Audioslave's debue. Drums, guitar, bass, and vocals are excellent and all mix together perfectly. If you appreciate great rock with amazing lyrics, guitar and drums, buy this album.
B00000JCOV|5.0|There isn't much more to say about Slipknot than what has already been said, and my two cents are going to be short.  Slipknot, though perhaps not the most pleasant to listen to, or the most talented, or the most whatever-you-can-think-of band out there, deliver the most impassioned and ferocious musical experience that is being created these days.  Although it can be one-dimensional, the emotion imparted by Slipknot into their recordings is nothing short of stirring.  And if you don't get anything but a solid \\"Hell Yeah\\" experience out of Slipknot, that's more than you might get out of a lot of other throw-away trash music being created today.  This goes for all of Slipknot's recordings, and that's all there is to say.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|Incredibly talented musician, including great voice, piano, and guitar.  Unique compositional style, so unusual in this period of music history.  Cannot recommend this cd too highly. Simply fantastic.  Great anticipation re: the future for Rufus.  Recommend you all see him live...did so in NYC 11/05...amazing concert.
0060899190|5.0|The second I got this book, I couldn't put it down.  I'd been a fan of postsecret for a while, and it was incredibly exciting to actually have a book.  It's amazing what people will share with strangers across the world.  I think the book struck an ultimate high point with me when I came across the page that says \\"'Dear Frank, I have made six postcards all with secrets that I was afraid to tell the one person I tell everything to, my boyfriend.  This morning I planned to mail them, but instead I left them on the pillow next to his head while he was sleeping.  Ten minutes ago he arrived at my office and asked me to marry him.  I said yes' -canada.\\"  Post secret is an ingenious idea that allows people to have a creative outlet as well as an outlet to let go of the weight of a secret without the pressure of judgement.  I would highly recommend this to EVERYONE!  Thanks Frank!
B0000009RX|3.0|Right off the bat I have to poo-poo the bad matching by whichever genius at Amazon paired this album up as \\"better together with\\" Freak Out.  \\"We're only in it for the Money\\" IS part one of \\"Lumpy Gravy.\\" Says so right on the cover (posed, tongue-in-cheek, as a sarcastic rhetorical question).<br /><br />The two albums together comprise a psychedelic operetta in which the atrocities of the united states in viet nam are terrifyingly overshadowed by the Johnson administrations' domestic mass abductions of counter-culture teenage runaways and their internment in concentration camps, where they were used in experiments that make Joseph Mengala look like a pretty nice guy.<br /><br />With such weighty subject matter, comedic relief reeks of anachronism, but Zappa and his Mothers pull it off. The stories are true; the crimes against humanity really happened.<br /><br />Anyone unfamiliar with - or doubtful of - the truly evil undertakings of the amerikan government under LBJ against its own citizens shouldn't merely listen to these two albums; they should STUDY them!
B00005JOIF|5.0|Coming off the huge-budget success of his remake of War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg is back with another of his \\"issue\\" movies in Munich, and the result is not only one of his best movies yet but easily one of the best of the decade so far.  Concerning the Israeli response to the infamous terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli competitors, Munich largely follows the Israeli contingent charged with killing the Black September planners behind the assault.  Obviously it has extra significance in the here and now, when fears of terrorism are so rampant, but Munich makes for a great watch anyway simply because it's so effective in its portrayal of the forces that drive people to devote so much time, energy, and resources to kill each other when they could be engaged in more constructive activities.  The technical abilities of Spielberg and his sidemen are of course on full display, but more than Spielberg's other serious movies (Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, most notably), the chief source of Munich's success lies in its nuanced portrayal of such complicated and touchy subject matter.<br /><br />Easily manipulated automatons, er, I mean patriots of any stripe may not find Munich to their liking, but it contains more than enough subtle shadings and moral ambiguity to please thinking viewers.  With ample room to operate given its considerable running time, Munich eventually develops into three movies: a taut political thriller, a complex examination of vengeance, and a harrowing look into the recesses of one man's mind.  Its blunt depictions of violence, emotional intensity, and frequent gallows humor may be unpleasant, but much like in The Pianist, discomfort is the name of the game here.  And much as the Pianist's tale of simple, brute survival could be applied to situations other than the Holocaust, Munich's (admittedly somewhat fictionalized) revenge story has a resonance well beyond the Middle East, which I'm sure is what Spielberg intended.<br /><br />Although it's told almost entirely from a Jewish point of view, the brilliance of Munich lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't ask the viewer to take sides (in spite of some of the rather shallow criticisms I've seen on this site and elsewhere), but instead examines the endless cycle of retaliation in a way that makes each side's case look both equally sensible and equally insane.  While it's mercifully short on long-winded oratory, the dialogue still frequently touches on the fact that each side thinks its claim to Israel is perfectly legitimate, and that there's plenty of guilt in the conflict to around.  Spielberg doesn't attempt to cover up the brutality of the Palestinian assualt in Munich, but as one member of the Israeli hit team notes, Arabs weren't the inventors of bloodshed.  Granted, we only hear second-hand about the Israeli government's less-than-warm-and-fuzzy treatment of its Palestinian population, but there's enough discussion of it to pierce any veneer of righteousness in Isreal's actions. Violence against civilians is a double-edged sword, the movie seems to be saying, one that people only notice when their own are the victims.<br /><br />Since the story is mostly told through the eyes of one man, it's a good thing Eric Bana is so chillingly convincing as Avner, a low-level Mossad agent and quiet family man given the task of leading the Israeli hit team.  Despite his lack of experience, Avner actually makes the perfect man for his job, as the nature of his work may give him pause, but in the end he compartmentalizes, accepts the justifications he's given, and kills whom he's told to kill.  As the movie makes clear, it's essential to any war or war-type conflict that we get by the fact that our enemies are every bit as human as we are, much as we might like to pretend otherwise.  Avner isn't one to stop and think carefully about what he's doing (at least until he's done, anyway), so it takes on added weight at the end of the movie when he does finally realize how little he's accomplished.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as we all know by now, this story doesn't have a happy ending, and the events of the past thirty years weigh heavily on Munich.  Of course, if everyone had made up back in the '70's, the subject matter wouldn't seem quite as important.  In the end, this movie supports a conclusion I reached a while back: the world would be a much better place if humankind declared a mulligan on all of history up till now, admitted every group has done some naughty things, and started over.  Of course, since the odds of that happening are about the same as the chances of the Red Sox winning the next Super Bowl, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.d of the movie when he does finally realize how little he's accomplished.

0790729601|4.0|Arnold does good job here being larger than life witness protection specialist. Robert Pastorelli gives a great performance and provides some humor that lightens things up a bit. James Caan in what turns out to be a bad guy role is also a plus. Good special effects shoot out at the end. Good for what it is and that's not bad. Recommend!
0307276902|2.0|Lies or not, this book is rather foul. Mr. Frey's overuse of literary techniques totally destroys the first half of this book. The book becomes more tolerable in the second half but just as irritating. There is a difference between airing dirty laundry and romanticizing the love-hate relationship with one's past sins....which in this case, appears to be mostly love. This book reeks of narcissism and some parts were so bad that I had to skim over them, and I am one that usually loves to soak up every single word.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Through my years of loving Green Day, they really reached the apex of their career with American Idiot.  Other than Dookie, this is the album that should define them -- not necessarily for the lyrics (as it's politically related and could push certain people away) but for their other talents. <br /> <br />I'll go through each song, one at a time. <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - The title track and first single.  It's catchy and repetitive, but does get old after a bit.  Still good to listen to every once in a while though.  One of my least favorites on the album but still good.  8.5/10. <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - Whoooa.  This is a long song that's over 9 minutes.  It's comprised of several parts, each one a bit different from the last.  It's one of the best on the album with great vocals and some sweet guitar playing.  The lyrics are also a bit funny, which I think is what they may have been aiming for.  Maybe.  Anyway, a great song.  9.5/10. <br /> <br />3. Holiday - The third single from the album.  Very, very, catchy.  Everything really fits, from the guitar playing to the drums to the sound of Billie.  Another one of my favorites.  9.5/10. <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - The second single from the album.  This is probably the most well-known song from the album because of its frequent airplay.  It's a slower song that has a strong point and is really fun to listen to.  It's what drew me to American Idiot since I originally had no plans on getting it.  10/10. <br /> <br />5. Are We Waiting - I don't like this song at all.  It's very boring and there's no real pickup to it.  The worst of the album.  6/10. <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy - A really catchy song all the way through.  A solid song off of the album.  8.5/10. <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - This and Are We Waiting are my least favorites on the album, but Give Me Novacaine is slightly better.  It's a bit of a slow song but it's not excellent or anything.  7/10. <br /> <br />8. She'sa Rebel - A catchy tune that's around 2 minutes long.  It's like a filler song but a good one, at that.  9/10. <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - A good song.  Not much else to say.  9/10. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb - One of my other favorites.  A great song with a  nice chorus.  9.5/10. <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - The latest single and really really annoying after you've heard it a lot.  It's slow although it has a firm point.  It's still good.  9/10. <br /> <br />12. Homecoming - Like Jesus of Suburbia, this song is over 9 minutes.  It's my favorite on the album and has some amazing lyrics to it.  It's catchy and all the parts are well constructed.  10/10. <br /> <br />13. Whatsername - A slow song which is EXCELLENT.  10/10. <br /> <br />Overall, Green Day fans need to get this if they don't already.  A solid album and one of Green Day's best.
B00005JOFO|5.0|If watching this movie at home is the first time you see it, I would suggest trying to avoid any of the distractions inherrent during a home viewing. This is the kind of film where, if you blink, you might break the spell. In my opinion, it was created for the big screen, theater-like type of viewing.<br /><br />So many people said we should forget about the \\"gay cowboy\\" aspect. Indeed. Although being about two gay men, this film is definitely not only for gay people. As any great film should be considered.<br /><br />Art film lovers would probably have oodles to discuss about \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". Delicate, subtle, beautiful, poignant, cerebral, devastating and haunting, this film is a work of art. It achieves what a great work of art does: gets one thinking, elicits powerful emotions and heavy controversy. Annie Proulx's novella was translated into a superb screenplay that remains faithful to the story and keeps the spirit of its characters alive. Besides the astonishing performances of both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal (and the rest of the acting cast, no less), what makes this movie many cuts above a mere tearjerker is the masterful direction. It seems like Ang Lee has not wasted any image, any second of this movie. Watch the camera work (great cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto), the subtle and symbolic use of detail and colors, the beautiful composition of so many images  and the precise positioning of the characters in certain scenes, all doen in order to tell the viewer so much more than what is said by dialogue. The love scenes, oh, here we go: quietly expressive, powerful, intimate, sensual yet not graphic. There's a sense of privacy and emotional restraint about Ang Lee's direction that make these scenes so affecting.<br />Then there is the music, delicate, almost scarce, complementing the movie instead of overpowering it, and beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Never has a guitar sounded so evocative like Gustavo Santaolalla's.<br />I believe it takes several viewings to be able to take this film in and fully appreciate it. This movie is so delicately expressive on so many levels that it permeates us, first emotionally, then on a more cerebral level. There are so many metaphors and symbols that abund and enrich it, making it a fulfilling experience, albeit quite devastating - the more we understand the beauty of this film, the deeper it cuts...<br />A word of warning, though. This is a film that does not do the thinking, feeling or judging for us. Most of all, it doesn't trivialize itself by making a statement, offering easy closure or redemption, answering questins - all things that would turn it into just another movie, not the timeless work of art it is. When watching it, we are on our own, at the mercy of our own mentality, sensibilities, perceptions, biases. It's a film that we don't view, we live, and it stays unyieldingly and unapologetically true to life until the end.to take this film in and fully appreciate it.

0307276902|1.0|It's a pity that Mr. Frey lied through and through in his book and that the public bought it hook, line and sinker. The law enforcement personnel mentioned in this book show that there is nothing behind the author's claims. The families of the victims mentioned in this book deny any knowledge of this person. There is no historical, actual, or witnessed fact in this piece of self-pitying fiction. It surprises me how a person can degrade himself for a publisher's millions. As Einstein famously wrote: \\"There are two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I'm not sure about the former.\\"<br /><br />A pox upon Mr. Frey and his enabler Oprah.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Had I read the back of the box at the movie store, I probably would not have watched this film. German transvestites? Sex-changes gone wrong? No thanks. But a friend recommended it, and I was very impressed. A little confused, but impressed. The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard, the characters are great, and it is a very creative film. It doesn't rest on the shock value of (very) alternative lifestyles to entertain (although some scenes were pushing it), and it was never offensive.
0380973650|3.0|Awesome subject matter:  how 'old fashioned' gods traveled to, and attempt to survive, in modern America.<br /><br />Great twist at the end of the story that I didn't see coming, and that was a really great sum up of the entire point of the novel.<br /><br />But, too little too late for me.  I just found the pacing and choices made in this novel not to my taste.  Gaiman is a wonderful storyteller with an incredible imagination, but the style with which he wrote this book was much too slow paced for me.<br /><br />There was too much page space devoted to things I didn't find quite as interesting.  Stories on how gods came to America and how they lived in modern times were a few pages at most, and sometimes only a few confusing paragraphs.  This was the subject that most interested me;  the gods, ancient and modern, and their lives.  Mostly, this story is devoted to the travels of Shadow, a man recently released from prison who's wife died while he was in.  The problem with this for me was that this character is approched with the same emotion for the death of his wife, or supernatural events, with all the emotion that he uses while walking down the street, or playing checkers.  That is to say, none.  He handles severe trauma and the severe supernatural as if it is something witnessed every day.  There is no character developement of him, either.  What you see is what you get through the entire book.<br /><br />At the end, I was left wondering exactly what the point of the whole thing was... which, in retrospect, might have been the point to the entire book.<br /><br />Not a bad novel by any means;  enough of my friends have loved it.  But simply not one to my tastes at all.
0307276902|1.0|By now it is abundantly clear that this book is a total scam. Mr. Frey's fifteen minutes of \\"fame\\" were up long ago. For those of you who bought into this \\"compelling\\" pseudomomoir, especially Oprah- you have been bamboozled. Meanwhile, Mr. Frey is laughing all the way to the bank. His genre is in keeping with our modern \\"culture\\"- vapid actors, inane movies, putrid television and now aliterate \\"literature\\". He peddled what many Americans desire \\"redemption\\" without recovery. Mr Barnum was so prescient- there are more suckers than ever.
B00005JN0T|1.0|Ugh. <br /> <br />Asimov fans will cringe at this crude adaptation of his works.  I found it to be bland,  action-packed tripe,  which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling;  cerebral,  mystery,  detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books.  Alas,  not in this film. <br /> <br />For someone who has never read an Asimov book,  then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient,  that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula;  good cool guy,  love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale.  You get that here. <br /> <br />Myself,  I prefer something a little more thought-provoking. <br /> <br />Like one of Issac Asimov's books,  for instance.
0767800478|2.0|It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others.  The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.    The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.    Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful!  Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland.  Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.  As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all.  Finally, somebody shoot the \\"Narrator,\\" PLEASE!  Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.  If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man.
B000BTGY7I|2.0|This new version of Snatch is a re-release of the original 2 disc edition that has been off the market for the past 2-3 years.  This one has added a little poker set (bad cards and a dealer chip) as well as a booklet.  The problem i have is that in the one i bought, the superbit version was included as the first disc - not the one that was supposed to be there with the commentary and branching features.  Don't know if this was widespread or not. <br /> <br />The cards are terrible.  The Suits are diamonds (like in the film) but also boxing gloves, guns and the dog.  WTF mate.  Also the numbers are in a bad font - stretched thin and difficult to read.  The booklet replaces the on disc filmography i believe and adds some production notes - its good looking and a nice edition. <br /> <br />If you have the deleted edition there is no need foir this - if you have any of the others this one is better than any other version and its pretty inexpensive.
0446677450|2.0|Kiyosaki is correct on some points.  If you want to be VERY wealthy, you must acquire assets that will make you money, not liabilities that will cost you money.  A big house is a liability, not an asset.  You must also be willing to take risks and go against the conventional wisdom.  That's true, but I would advise anyone deciding to go for it using Kiyosaki's formula to keep your head.  In my immediate family, several people have started their own businesses, Kiyosaki-style.  Most of these businesses made little or no money and only wasted family resources.  My father-in-law successfully made the big money.  Unfortunately he continued starting new businesses, lost it all, and recently died in bankruptcy.  The most financially successful person in my family is one of my brothers, who married a frugal woman, did 20 years in the Air Force, and didn't waste his time going for the Big Deal.  It doesn't take huge wealth to be happy or have a good life.<br /><br />Some of Kiyosaki's advice is a bit shallow.  Of course it's true that successful investment requires buy low, sell high.  He advises that people should develop their financial intelligence.  If it was that simple, there'd be a lot less poverty in the world.  In real life it's not easy to tell when you buy something whether it will turn out to be an asset or a liability.  Most people are not good judges of their own financial intelligence.  There are plenty of seasoned financial professionals who lose their shirts.  Enron shows that.<br /><br />Kiyosaki mentions that it's harder to become wealthy today than it was years ago.  This is true, but he doesn't follow up on it.  A few decades ago a hard-working person without extraordinary talent, pricey education, or inherited wealth could achieve a house in the suburbs, raise several children, and enjoy a comfortable retirement.  This isn't the case any more, which is a little sad.  We are increasingly living in a \\"Winner Take All\\" economy.  I believe we are likely to see a continuing decline in living standards over the next few decades.  The main reasons are the ongoing increase in the U.S. population, depletion of resources (especially the passing of the oil peak), and climate change. Kiyosaki calls the idea that there may be limits on the U.S. economy \\"Chicken Little.\\"  Well, I don't agree.  I would recommend that anyone who reads Kiyosaki's book balance it with some contrary opinions and other roads to achieving wealth.  I suggest \\"Your Money or Your Life\\" by Dominguez and Robin, and \\"The Long Emergency\\" by Kunstler.ely to see a continuing decline in living standards over the next few decades.

B000AP04FG|1.0|I was just watching this movie and it is terrible.  There's nothing but a lack of plot and I'm so bored by this movie that I just stopped watching it and didn't see the ending.  This has to be one of the first movies's I've seen that I didn't care to see the ending.  Anybody that gave this movie 4 stars only gave it because of Brad Pitt or seeing Angelina Jolie.  Well, that and some action.  I'm a fan of action movies and movies with lots of violence, but you gotta have a decent plot to go with it to make it a great and enjoyable movie.  Be smart and don't see this movie or if you do see it, rent it before buying it and you'll be happy that you saved the money.  If you want to see some really cool movies, check out Heist, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Swordfish.  Now those are some good action movies with great plots.
B000B8QF00|5.0|As i said in another review there is no perfect collection. I think that hidden track from Jagged Little Pill should have made it. Otherwise it is perfect. Most collections do stupid things. For example we could have had half the hits from Jagged in their new acoustic state. Or live versions of songs that were popular in a studio state. (For example You Oughta Know's Grammy version could have been here) <br /> <br />Whoever compiled this cd BRAVO! this is essential for any collection. You get mostly hits and a few songs intended to be hits but weren't. <br /> <br />Please read and rate all my reviews
B0000CCZ34|5.0|If you don't own all of the Pet Shop Boys' albums already, this is the collection for you. It catalogues thirty-five of their hit singles and includes two new songs on two CDs. I have the 'import' version, which includes a third disc called 'Mix', a collection of remixes that will keep you moving on the dance floor. If you're not that big a fan of the PSB, consider picking up 'Discography', their first singles collection that was released in 1991. My fave tracks include 'Suburbia', 'What Have I Done to Deserve This?', 'Heart', 'Rent' and 'Opportunities'. <br />Pick up the PopArt compilation if you want to have all of the PSB hits in one collection. You won't be disappointed.

And then onto the NYT best seller lists.<br /><br />But he did all this based on lies and deceit. That's like getting an \\"A\\" on a test by copying from your seat mate. It doesn't prove mastery or talent or anything else. All it proves is that this is an author (journalist??) who can't be entrusted with the truth.<br /><br />I've been trying to climb up the ladder of success a different way - through working my arse off and publishing several books in the last few years.

B000002UZ6|4.0|I am reviewing the Simply the Best collection after buying and listening to the All The Best collection. Although I have owned Simply The Best since it came out in 1991, it is not as great a compilation as All The Best for two reasons: 1.) It only catalogues Tina's music that was recorded on the Capitol label and 2.) it doesn't reach all the way back to the earlier years of Tina's career (with the exception of River Deep, Mountain High). Nonetheless, it provides a good sampling of Tina's biggest hits from 1983 through to 1989. Everything is here from Let's Stay Together which marked her comeback, What's Love Got To Do With It, We Don't Need Another Hero, Typical Male, What You Get Is What You See, The Best, Look Me In The Heart, Steamy Windows plus you get four previously unreleased tracks including my favourite Love Thing, which just rocks! <br /> <br />If you're a so-so fan of Tina's music, you may be satisfied with this compilation but if you're a die-hard fan of Tina's musical catalogue, pick up her most recent collection called All The Best which includes just about all of her hit singles. Let's hope that Tina has more new music to come. This can't be the end of her career - it can only be Simply The Best so far....
B000BB1MI2|5.0|The old Chocolate Factory movie has become an Easter classic. My family, at least since the time I could remember, has always watched this movie on Easter Day, usually right before dinner, with the newest generation of children. But, unlike my family, I never had any interest in the old Chocolate Factory movie. In fact, I never watched the entire thing the whole way through until about a year ago. I liked it, but I didn't see the magic in it that everyone else saw. It's not a Wizard of Oz, like it's often compared to.<br /><br />When the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remake came out, I was once again uninterested. These movies just aren't my thing. I had no real care to see it. In fact, the only thing I really cared about was the fact that Tim Burton directed it. It wasn't enough for me to want to go to the theaters, though, so I let it pass from my mind.<br /><br />Later, I was given the opportunity to watch Burton's Chocolate Factory on DVD. What the heck, I thought, may as well give it a chance. And from the moment I hit start, I was entranced. Remakes aren't often the best movies, but this movie is excellent, more memorable than the first, I think. Most people know the story of the movies, so I won't go into that. I will say, however, that this movie adds a great deal to the Charlie and the Chocolate factory franchise. Firstly, it's a darker Willie Wonka with a past. We get to see some of his motivation for wanting to start a chocolate factory. We're also given a few fresh songs, sung from a different style of Oompah Loompah. And, it's modernized. I think that's the reason why I didn't like the first Chocolate Factory like others do, because it's just a little beyond my time. Everything in this version was brought up to date.<br /><br />Johnny Depp was an excellent choice for the new Willie Wonka, mainly because the Charlie in this film works so well with him, and is a fine young actor by himself. The young actor (whose name escapes me) previously played J. M. Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan in the movie Finding Neverland. The other children, whose roles are familiar to the first movie, play their parts just as well as they were played before.<br /><br />This is a new holiday movie, not made to exactly replace the old version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it's definitely a more modern equal to the film classic. I'd recommend this movie to lovers of the first movie as well as those new to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory world, if that's even possible. This is a great movie for the family.yed J. M.

B00005JO04|3.0|I was wandering aimlessly tonight along the streets of the beautiful Montreal, until I thought hey, maybe I could watch a movie. I chose Syriana because I was actually fascinated by the commercial (it made it look so good). First let me say that the acting was perfect, no doubt about that, from George Clooney to Matt Damon, and maybe everyone else in between. However, I was disappointed that the movie created a set of circumstances that are actually a bit hard to believe (especially for the intelligent people watching this type of movies), like how Damon had a tragic accident while visiting an arab prince and consequently earning his favor. The prince actually made him his close monetary advisor. The new monetary advisor started by proposing some unrealistic (considering the current and foreseeable politics in the region) advices to make his country (KSA) better, and sustainable on the long run. Now call me a bit skeptical, but shouldn't such countries have a whole army of financial advisors just figuring out such stuff, hiring Damon was a thing that I wasn't able to digest. Then again, I thought I might be wrong. But the movie went on, and it took us to an unrealistic Beirut (which is actually Casablanca) that the director insisted on making it look like it was at 1975, even though the movie is actually about 2005. I mean come on, I think the whole success of such movies is sticking to facts, not modifying them to fit in the plot. Other things also make you wonder, like when the board of two of the most powerful oil companies in the US choose a not-so-high ranking employee living in a poor area to lead an oil investigation probably worth trillions of dollars. <br />Having said all the above, I think the movie is not that bad, it's not that good either, but then again, maybe I had higher hopes for this movie.
B00000J6AG|5.0|One of the things I enjoy about Moby is his ability to provoke emotion without the use of words, lyrics, or vocals.  Instruments are all he needs, and that's proven several times on this album, with songs like Inside, Guitar Flute & String, but most of all: Everloving.  I can't even begin to explain my life for this song, with it's subtle and soft beginning, to it's gradual climb and then it's climax.   <br /> <br />Get this album.
B000002WYT|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time..  every song on here is good (*my personal favorites):    1. So Much To Say- Very up beat, has a little bit of a bluesy southern sound    2. *Two Step- The verses have a sort of western (not like country.. but like cowboys and mexicans kinda) sound to it.  The chorus has a pretty different sound, but it still flows well with the song.    3. *Crash Into Me- My favorite song on the cd.  It moves.    4. Too Much- Rock like, with dmb put into it    5. *#41- the intro of this song is brilliant and the rest is solos between violin and sax    6. *Say Goodbye- #41 transfers into this song, and it takes about a minute to get to the vocals, but it works with a combination of guitar and flute riffs.    7. Drive In Drive Out- Similar in a way to Too Much, but I prefer this song.  Rock.    8. Let You Down- Acoustic with like bongos or something in the background.  Soft vocals, and remains soft.    9. *Lie In Our Graves- Great song, lots of acoustic riffs, very up beat, with occasional solos on violin.. there is a long solo section before it returns to the chorus later in the song.    10. Cry Freedon- A slow jam, chords strummed on the electric guitar, with soft vocals.    11. *Tripping Billies- Very happy, the chorus is cool.    12. *Proudest Monkey- Slow, but gets bigger later with all the instruments gradually crescendoing to a big basket of sound.      The first DMB cd I bought was this, and it is pretty much the most awesome cd ever.

B000A2H2TK|4.0|\\"The Missing Piece\\" is an underrated album. While it's not GG's best the material demonstrates that they could write material with strong hooks and still make it memorable. Unlike the follow up \\"Giant for a Day\\" (which has weaker material), \\"The Missing Piece\\" sounds a bit less poppy as there are a couple of tracks that recall \\"Free Hand\\" and \\"in'terview\\". Even when the band dipped their toe into FM Rock/mainstream, they still pulled out interesting stuff better than most bands.<br /><br />The clever opening and fun \\"Two Weeks in Spain\\" gives way to the power ballad(!)\\"I'm Turning Around\\" which sounds like an escapee from a 10cc album. \\"Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It\\" built around a guitar figure from an early Gentle Giant song has the energy of punk and is a straight forward rock song. The blues boogie of \\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\" has a few nice tricky changes making it more than a straight ahead blues rocker. \\"Mountain Time\\" sounds like a long lost Steve Winwood track. \\"As Old as You're Young\\" recalls the band's earlier style although a bit simplified. \\"Memories of Old Days\\" again harks back to the band's earlier sound although it's a bit simplified it could easily have been an outtake from an earlier GG album.<br /><br />The closing tracks \\"Winning\\" and \\"For Nobody\\" pull the album together with a pair of straight ahead rock songs the former a memorable rock song that opens with a burst of percussion suggesting the song will be a trip into Santana territory and the latter a thumping rocker. We get \\"For Nobody\\" again live. It's strictly bootleg quality but is memorable for an energetic performance.<br /><br />The original album art has been adapted to the CD package with the cover \\"missing piece\\" slightly raised from the rest of the cover. The booklet includes all the lyrics. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have a booklet that discussed the challenges the band faced adapting to the marketplace and the pressures that dicated the changes seen here and on their last two albums.<br /><br />There was a complaint from another reviewer about the excessive hiss. While it certainly is more noticable than the previous release, it's not that distracting nor is it a big enough deal to ding this CD an additional star.st two albums.

B00003CWPL|1.0|I'm with the people who a positive writer abused as pinheads: this is far and away the worst film I have ever seen. I was willing to look on the page for three minutes for the button to write a review because I feel strongly that people should save their money. <br /> <br />Ayn Rand has said that, \\"Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.\\" As definitions of art go, this is pretty good. That's why I did not like this work of art: the film was a dark chaos, a nightmare of disconnected events without plot, theme, or direction. The director's values come from a selective representation of reality I strongly dislike. The overview begins, \\"This is where the Lynchian nightmare started.\\" That's an understatement. It is out-and-out nihilism. It is entirely lacking in any values I could connect with. <br /> <br />This film is bad enough that more than 20 years later, it is still at the top of my list of never-see-again films. It's bad enough that I'll write my first review on this.
B000669GAI|5.0|I bought this CD a while back, loved the compilation (Upside, Downside), the only fault I can find with it is the lack of live tracks.  I used to go to all the PJ shows, (just recently...well last year...went to the PJ and Rolling Stones in Penn!) and I really enjoyed the feel of the live experience.  A few live tracks should have been added to complete the Pearl Jam effect.  But, I recommend this CD to any of you new PJ fans, and of course all the old fans should buy this CD - even though we already have every song on it - just to support PJ.
B000301YY8|4.0|I don't fully understand all the hype surrounding this album - nor why people are putting James Blunt down for not being the next Damien Rice, Nick Drake, etc.  OK - James Blunt is definitely not as innovative or fiercely raw as Damien Rice!  But Blunt has a unique sound, his lyrics are actually interesting and insightful, and I don't know what more I expect from a debut album.  If everyone were Damien Rice, then Damien Rice would be boring - right? <br /> <br />I have enjoyed this album, as an entire album, more than any other I've purchased since Damien Rice's \\"O\\" and Joseph Arthur's \\"Redemption's Son\\" (both of which I consider 5 star albums).   <br /> <br />I usually end up making my own mixes on iTunes because listening to one artist gets monotonous; it's unusual for me to find entire albums that have a consistently listenable mix of tempos, subjects, and sounds. some of these songs are catchy in the classic pop mode (\\"Wise\\" Men, for example), others are more quiet and restful. It's a pleasantly varied, mellow mix--if I have to compare it to any other recent albums in that respect, I think it's a lot like Howie Day's \\"Stop All The World Now\\" (with the song \\"Collide\\"). It cohabitates in the cd changer well with Coldplay. It doesn't do well with Sigur Ros or Black Eyed Peas.  It just depends on the mood of the day.     <br /> <br />Whether you also enjoy this album will depend on what you want out of it - if you expect it to be the next huge innovation in folk rock, I think you'll be disappointed. But if you enjoy \\"You're Beautiful\\" (at least, if you did before the radio played it to death), I think you will like the rest of \\"Back to Bedlam\\".
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I normally would put more time into a review, but all I can really say about this movie is that it is hands down the greatest all around horror movie ever made.  It truly is the most enjoyable horror film to watch.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I was kind of surprised by this film in the sense that this doesn't fit into Hollywood's formula for making horror movies these days. Meaning that the system thinks that most horror fans have double digit IQ's. Then I found out that it was independently made, and it all made sense. It actually has a carefully orchestrated plot. It even builds up on a mental level and not just on a visual one. Of course, they're really are a lot of brain-dead horror fans out there who couldn't understand something as clever as this if the jigsaw killer made their life depend upon it. As far as the uncut version goes, I wouldn't waste your money on it unless you don't have a copy of it already in your collection. I don't know what insignificant detail that the MPAA made them cut out of this movie, because I didn't see it at all. Unless you're big into extras or an avid collector who can't resist that way cool bleeding cover.

B000001FSP|5.0|When I first bought this recording, in 79 or 80, it was seldom off my turntable, and lived in my car's tape deck on a continent-wide drive.  Then I got it on CD, in the now-impossible-to-get combo with Strange Weather, which cracked one day.  Now I have it again.  And it's still one of the best recordings (of thousands) that I've ever listened to.<br /><br />There are many highlights here, and I won't pick favorites, but am particularly amused by her cover of Shel Silverstein's (yes, the kids book author and Playboy cartoonist) Ballad of Lucy Jordan, as dark a reading of a really dark set of lyrics as you will ever find.  I love the music (synthesizers and guitars and driving rhythm) and I love the arrangements.<br /><br />Some years after Broken English I saw Marianne perform live at a club in Toronto.  She came on stage in a twinset and a cultured English accent, the living personification of her first \\"beautiful songbird\\" incarnation (circa As Tears Go By), plus 20 years or so.  Then she sang and it was back to the dark side of the world.
6305949980|5.0|Everyone thinks that this is a Tim Burton film but he did not direct it.  The film is based on poem that Burton wrote and he produced the film. <br /> <br />This film takes place where every holiday has a \\"Land\\". Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon / Danny Elfman) is the king of Halloween Land.  Another brilliant Halloween is over and Jack is bored with Halloween.  Jack wanders the forest and finds the entrance to the other \\"Towns\\".   He is drawn to the bright and shiny door of Christmas Town.  He is sucked into the portal and what he sees amazes him.  He is dazzled by the Christmas lights and snow.  And Jack decides to take over Christmas. <br /> <br />Christmas Eve arrives and Jack takes over for Santa and delivers the presents made by Halloween Town.  Unfortunately, they are more appropriate for Halloween than Christmas. <br /> <br />Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is the servant to the evil scientist (William Hickey) but she has a fascination with Jack.  When Oogie Boogie (Ken Paige) decides to take over Halloween Town, Sally comes to Jack's rescue. <br /> <br />In the end everything works out. <br /> <br />The story is well thought out and the dialogue is witty.  The production design and character design are outstanding.  They create the atmosphere of the movie.  Add to this a brilliant score by Danny Elfman.  This creates one of the best stop animation movies. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Commentary by director Henry Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik <br /> <br />Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - A 25 minute making of featurette with Burton, Selick, co producer Kathleen Gavin, Danny Elfman, storyboard supervisor Joseph Ranft, supervising animator Eric Leighton, art director Deane Taylor, set designer Gregg Olsson, cinematographer Pete Kozachik, motion control camera operator Dave Hanks, sculptor Greg Dykstra, animator Mike Belzer, armature engineer Blair Clark, character fabrication supervisor Bonita DeCarlo, animator Anthony Scott and track reader Dave Mason.  As you can see this is not your ordinary making of featurette, you get a full understanding of the stop motion animation process. <br /> <br />Storyboard to Film Comparison -  A four minute comparison that has a storyboard on top and the scene below. <br /> <br />Deleted Scenes: Deleted Storyboards described by Henry Selick - Three deleted storyboards that were never animated totaling 3 minutes with reason why they were not pursued. <br /> <br />Deleted Scenes: Deleted Animated Sequences described by Henry Selick - Four deleted scenes totaling 5 minutes with reason why they were cut or edited.  I like when there is commentary so we know why it was cut. <br /> <br />The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - This takes you behind the scenes in Halloween Town, Christmas Town and the Real World.  This shows character design, concept art and sometimes animation tests.  Usually I don't care about these extras but this is a unique film and this is a unique look at the creative process that you need to see.  <br /> <br />Tim Burton's Early Films: Vincent - A 6 minute stop animation short narrated by Vincent Price.  It's a cute parody on Vincent Price's movies. <br /> <br />Tim Burton's Early Films: Frankenweenie - A 30 minute parody of the Frankenstein tales with a boy and his dog that was run over by a car starring Shelly Duvall, Daniel Stern and Barret Oliver. <br /> <br />The extras are exceptional to go with an exceptional film. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|I just saw this movie and I thought it was well put together... The guys are totally amazing and played really good roles. Oscars here they come. They deserve it. Must see movie!!!! Believe what the ratings say; its worth the buck : )
B00026W82U|5.0|I have loved melody, intelligence and use of both lyric and music to give to the heart and soul of a matter.   <br /> <br />This album is superb for me!   <br /> <br />It follows the greatness of groups such as Fra Lippo Lippi, Weekend, Dislocation Dance, Blue Nile and others that have great vocals, mix of genre and influence that should appeal to everyone that are eclectic and love music for musics sake, but at the same time they are unique in themselves.   <br /> <br />I will never understand why band like this do not get the recognition they deserve.
B00005YW4H|5.0|As a general rule, I tend to listen Middle Eastern music mostly.  I turned on my television one day to hear a lovely woman singing a song called, \\"Sunrise.\\"  I found that I couldn't stop listening to such a beautiful voice with refreshing music for our modern times.  The women was Norah Jones.  I purchased not to long after this two Cd's of hers, this one and the one called, \\"Feels Like Home,\\" because it had the song I first heard.  I had lost the two Cd's going through Hurricane Katrina, when our home was damaged.  I just replaced this CD and hope to replace the other in the future.  Music of this caliber is a  rarity in today's market, for it  reminds me of the old torch singers of the forties.  One thing I know when you purchase this Cd you will not be disappointed, unless you more into Rap or Hip Hop.
1400032717|5.0|This was an interesting book. I knew a lot of authors try to write from the perspective of a child, and many authors fail writing from the perspective of a child. But thankfully, Haddon succeeded wonderfully. Worth checking out.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|Awesome film, not as sickening as I feared, but gruesome scenes and people's personalities abound.  After reading the reviews here, I thought the 2 main male characters would be dislikable, but I didn't get that at all.  I felt terrible for them and was AMAZED at the ending.  See it.  You won't forget it for a while.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|...which is another great movie, btw.<br /><br />This movie establishes what made McQueen one of the finest actors of his time, and hands down why he shares the \\"Man's Man\\" crown with Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The amazing chase scene (60's and 70's movies were such showcases for Detroit, and hey, I have no problem with that), incredible soundtrack by Mr. Schifrin, and the i'll-kick-your-azz-with-one-hand-tied detective Frank Bullitt combine to put this at the top of my classic movies list.<br /><br />McQueen always played characters with such minimalism.  He always came across as bad as bad gets, still with vunerability.  He even made frozen TV dinners seem cool.<br /><br />The fact that McQueen did the majority of the driving for Bullitt (and LeMans, the Great Escape, and all stuntwork in On Any Sunday) says he was an actor who took his craft very seriously.<br /><br />Even in 2006, this movie still burys the needle on the cool-meter.
B0000256KE|5.0|When Roxy Music reunited in 2001, they dipped into the bulk of this album, unfortunately, Brian Eno didn't take part in the shows.  <br /> <br />But in 1973, they recorded an album so far ahead of its time that it still sounds futuristic today. The sax, synths and screaming guitars along with Ferry's haunting vocals make for creepy afterhours listening.  <br /> <br />Those who are only familiar with Roxy and Bryan from the 80s on are going to be shocked when they hear this. Those who love Ziggy-era as well as the Eno-Fripp and Eno-Bowie collaborations will love it.  Those who have watched Rocky Horror can picture Richard O'Brien listening to this relentlessly. You can hear Radiohead putting this one on as a point of reference for their more recent work (Thom Yorke does a fairly decent Ferry soundalike on the \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" soundtrack). You can hear Tangerine Dream, Can and Kraftwerk taking notes as well as goth pioneers like bauhaus and Joy Division cutting their teeth on this one, or Bowie and Peter Gabriel seeing how \\"the enemy\\" is doing. Another name that came to mind was director David Lynch, who would work with Eno on a \\"Dune\\" track. You can picture Bono and Edge discussing the songs...   <br /> <br />There are accessible songs like \\"Do The Strand\\" and \\"Editions of You\\", and then you have \\"Bogus Man\\", \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\\" and \\"For Your Pleasure\\" which are as far out as you can get.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Stoic and sullen, McQueen has few lines in this picture.  However, he acts without dialogue, painting the exact picture of the brooding racer facing death and the past.<br /><br />...and hey, the screaming sounds of those Porsches and Ferraris beats any soundtrack I've heard.<br /><br />If you like McQueen, you'll probably think Le Mans just solidifies his place amongst the great minimalist actors of the movie age.
0743424425|5.0|Fantastic book. Read this one if you can.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Korn is dead. Korn comitted suicide by recording Follow The Leader back in 1998. That means that they're dead for 8 years. That means their albums only stink even more.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Yeah, I know it's been out forever, but they don't send us everything. American Idiot is by far the greatest and most mature album that Green Day has ever produced. In the grand scheme of great rock albums, I found it to be nothing special.
B00001OH80|3.0|in the mid 1980's, David Bowie had finally ascended to the top of the Billboard charts, placing himself along the same level of popularity as Michael Jackson and Prince thanks to the Let's Dance album,  however, that wasn't to last when he released \\"Tonight\\" in the fall of 1984. <br /> <br />Both fairweather \\"pop\\" fans as well as longterm Bowie fans found something to love with the leadoff track, \\"Loving The Alien\\", a song that puts the album off to a great start.   The song was inevitably released as a single, but when he released it in the summer of 1985, the album was dead in both the US and UK and didn't become the hit it rightfully deserved to be (I think it should've been released as the followup to \\"Blue Jean\\" <br /> <br />Next we get a midtempo reggae track called \\"Don't Look Down\\", which drags. <br /> <br />The album officially becomes kitsch with \\"God Only Knows\\", a torch remake of the Beach Boys classic. <br /> <br />The second single (most likely due to the fact that Tina Turner was hot at the point) was \\"Tonight\\", an upbeat but slow reggaeish track that doesn't sound much different than \\"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\\" by Culture Club. <br /> <br />The album picks up with the next two tracks, \\"Neighborhood Threat\\" and \\"Blue Jean\\".  Both tracks are rockers and are very fun to listen to.  \\"Blue Jean\\" was the leadoff single and went to #8 on the Billboard chart. <br /> <br />\\"Tumble And Twirl\\" starts the crash again, a mid-tempo calypso track that I usually skip. <br /> <br />The next track is another ill-advised remake, \\"I Keep Forgettin'\\" by Elvis.  It's actually a fun track but yet you couldn't help but realize just how below Bowie's calibre this song is. <br /> <br />The album ends up with a high point, the rocking \\"Dancing With The Big Boys\\" <br /> <br />All in all, one of Bowie's worst albums,  but it's not necessarily BAD.  Bowie just managed to record so many great albums through his career that albums such as this and Never Let Me Down look worse than they really are because this is the guy who has delivered classic after classic throughout his career that a few 80's mis-steps are real scars on the resume. <br /> <br />If you get this on CD, I'd recommend checking out the 1995 Virgin cd used instead of the 1999 reissue.   The Virgin remaster includes three of Bowie's best soundtrack songs from the era (in this time, Bowie's soundtrack work was far exceeding the albums in quality), \\"This Is Not America\\" from The Falcon and The Snowman, a top 40 hit, \\"As The World Falls Down\\" from Labyrinth and \\"Absolute Beginners\\", which is included in its epic 8 minute entirity here... these are the highlights of the album and they aren't even from the original record.

B000301YY8|1.0|My girlfriend bought this cd by James Blunt and I chewed her out after I heard what rubbish it is. This guy has the most irritating, whiney (as another reviewer mentions) voice that I've ever heard. Apparently Amazon is pushing this cd as they've edited my review so that the worst I've said is missing. Whatever happened to freedom of speech Amazon?
B00005B364|5.0|My Amazon recommendation string led me to the Focus \\"Moving Waves\\" page, and I was (as usual) interested in having my own long-held opinions validated by kindred spirits world wide.  Unfortunately, I find only scattershot praise for what in my estimation is in fact THE GREATEST PROG ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />I should quickly explain that as we grow up, we all have awakening experiences that open up new dimensions of life to us. Some we can remember, some we can't.  For me, however, at age 15-16 or so, hearing Focus' \\"Moving Waves\\" around 1972-73 on a cruddy console stereo in a friend's basement was surely a defining musical experience in my life.  I'd grown up (like everyone else) with the Beatles & Stones and the rest of the great British invasion sounds, and they certainly deserve their spot in the firmament of R&R heaven.  But \\"Moving Waves\\" was (and is) a unique synthesis of rock, jazz, classical, all fused into an in-your-face whole that grabbed me by the throat and shook me for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I will not presume on your attention any longer than necessary except to point out that the fury and swagger of Jan Akkerman's guitar solos has NEVER been equaled by any other guitarist in my hearing.  Yeah, you could call \\"Hocus Pocus\\" (by Focus) \\"silly\\", but you'd be WRONG WRONG WRONG.  This is a band completely hitting its stride, a band that can do ANYTHING and if you got a problem with the yodeling, go buy the new Bobby Sherman album instead.  What other band has had the sheer audacity to even consider such a thing and pull it off with such blistering panache?<br /><br />I cannot close without trying to impart some of the emotional majesty of side two's  (yeah, I'm an LP era guy) track-long opus \\"Eruption;\\" several instrumental themes are introduced and repeated over the course of a 20+ minute \\"suite.\\"  It's all a more than worthy effort, and I won't belabor your attention with a blow-by-blow description, but the BIG MOMENT comes toward the middle of the piece--the section titled \\"The Bridge\\" concludes with two smashing chords repeated as a launching pad for Akkerman's blistering descending Gibson Les Paul custom runs; repeated three times with variations by the angelically-inspired Akkerman, he's left snarling in the void on his own with no accompaniment.  Closing with a final descending left-hand only tear-off riff (I know of no other guitarist who could do this), the section ends abruptly, segueing to flautist/organist Thijs Van Leer's sublime \\"Euridice\\" (pron. \\"you-rid-a-sea\\" for the benefit of those not aware of Greek mythology), a gentle flute/piano duo eventually adding the entire quartet that is as close to perfection as I can imagine.  It's not just the beauty of the composition--it's the amazing, stark contrast between the \\"over the cliff\\" fury of Akkerman's guitar followed by the Johann Sebastian consonance of Van Leer's singular genius.  I KNOW I can't be the only person in the world totally captured for life by this moment.  But let me hear from you.<br /><br />FOCUS deserves a lot more love than this forum can lavish on them, and those who are harmonious with my assessment of \\"Moving Waves\\" should advance quickly to \\"Hamburger Concerto,\\" two albums later and almost equally sublime (Van Leer is ascendent on HC, and that is NOT a bad thing).  EVERY Focus album has something GREAT, including their \\"worst\\" album, 1975's \\"Mother Focus\\" which still has one of the greatest short compositions of all time, \\"Focus V.\\"  Very few bands ever working in \\"rock\\" had the musical chops that Focus did, and NONE came anywhere close to the absolutely unique synthesis of styles they achieved.  If you're willing to give this recording a chance I do believe it can still echo down your life as it has with mine.rd the middle of the piece--the section titled \\"The Bridge\\" concludes with two smashing chords repeated as a launching pad for Akkerman's blistering descending Gibson Les Paul custom runs; repeated three times with variations by the angelically-inspired Akkerman, he's left snarling in the void on his own with no accompaniment.

B0000AQS6R|4.0|Perhaps one of the greatest comebacks in comedy history, this third Vacation is just as funny as the first, almost (ALMOST) erasing memory of Vacation 2, European. Anyway, the Griswolds are staying home for the holidays. Clark (Chevy Chase) has cut down a tree too big for the living room; the in-laws are all invited, except Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid)and his clan, but they show up anyway; and John Hughes has delivered another comic delight.<br /><br /> As I said earlier, the Vacation series has an odd history. The first was great, an adult family comedy (yep, it's possible). Then the sequel, European Vacation, was released, with a bad joke for every good joke the first one had. Also, Audrey and Rusty were now played by different actors, neither very good (admittedly, the Rusty and Audrey are different in this, too, but they're effective), and poor Eric Idle (and other British actors) who make appearances.<br /><br /> Oh yeah, this is a review of Christmas Vacation. Yeah, this movie is equally funny as the first, a bit less adult, but still throwing in plenty of bad taste, all of it side-splitting. There's a electrocuted kitty, a very special Christmas dinner, a flaming tree, and a sled ride with a trash can lid. There's kidnapping and a squirrel attack for good effect, as well. So if you didn't think it was possible to redeem the Vacation movies, here's proof. Merry Christmas, fans... and burn all copies of European Vacation.
B000002J0G|5.0|When Alex Skolnick left after the not-so-well-taken The Ritual, everyone thought Testament was done, not so, James Murphy joins on this album, I do miss the shredding of Skolnick, but Murphy can shred also, this is a fine mix of Thrash and Death, Chuck Billy really brings out the growl on this one, he would more on the follow up, Demonic, I'm a fan of all Testament releases, this one achieves the old sound, as well as the future sound, in better words, the transition album, Testament prove they can be DMish, as well as being the legendary Thrash band they are, where as The Ritual was slow, this is faster, the production is nice, Billy proves more on this album, what a great vocalist he is, can do the melodic ones, the pissed off ones, the DM ones, truely amazing. <br /> <br />Low 5/6, A very strong start to the album, catchy riffs, nice tempo changes <br /> <br />Legions (In Hiding) 5/4, Not quite as strong as Low, but still a nice track, nice riffing and soloing here <br /> <br />Hail Mary 5/6, One of the best songs on the album, it's very catchy <br /> <br />Trail Of Tears 5/6, Testament return with yet another ballad, infact, this is the best one, right up there with The Legacy off Souls of Black <br /> <br />Shades of War 5/5, A nice strong track, it's different <br /> <br />P.C 5/5, It's short, but nothing short of greatness <br /> <br />Dog Faced Gods 5/6, Another one of the best songs on the album, starts out wicked DMish, then moves into a more thrash stance <br /> <br />All I Could Bleed 5/5, Nice and catchy, nice solo <br /> <br />Urotsukidoji 5/1, Sorry, I'm not much of an instrumental fan <br /> <br />Chasing Fear 5/4, Stands with Legions (In Hiding) doesn't hold the impact that the rest do, but still manages to be great <br /> <br />Ride 5/5, just rules <br /> <br />Last Call, 5/0, not an instrumental fan
B0000DZ3IG|1.0|<br />\\"Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD?  Give me a break! <br /> <br />As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack.  I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) \\"All I want for Christmas is You.\\" <br /> <br />Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie.  In the movie she sings her intro without background music.  On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses. <br /> <br />When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?  Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation? <br /> <br />J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I didn't know Firefly until August of 2005. A friend of mine was somewhat obsessed with the series, received in on DVD for his birthday, and made me sit down and watch it. I didn't expect much, but ended up hooked and begging for more by the time the series was over. <br /> <br />I first saw 'Serenity' at midnight on the day of its opening, and I have never had a better movie-going experience. The sense of passion, excitement and victory amongst the crowd was something that's rare to experience today. Joss Whedon wrote a film that took us on a rollercoaster ride and left us breathless. <br /> <br />I've shown the movie to my friends, and most of them said, \\"It was good,\\" while a couple loved it. It's a great stand-alone film, but, in all honesty, will probably be much more poignant and meaningful if you've seen the 'Firefly' series. I hate to support Fox, but if you get a chance to watch 'Firefly' first, do it. <br /> <br />Otherwise, prepare yourself for an amazing film that BBC voted the #1 movie of 2005. Help this universe live on - check out Serenity, and tell everyone you know about it.
B00006IRJU|5.0|Oh, 1987,  not a happy time in my life,  but there was Man of<br /><br />Colours,  and it seemed that listening to it helped me believe<br /><br />that joy and happiness were still out there.  It is a great<br /><br />CD,  Heartbreak Kid,  Man of Colours, My Obsession,  songs<br /><br />that still sound sweet to my ear these many years later.  Lucky<br /><br />Australia,  you can claim Iva Davies as your own.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Firefly until recently, and by the time I was done watching, I was obsessed with helping this series live on. <br /> <br />Firefly is amazing. It's funny, it's poignant, original, well-written, well-directed, and the cast is superb. It's a rarity in television - something you can truly watch over and over, and never grow tired of. I knew very little about Joss Whedon before being exposed to this series, but now I respect him as one of the best writer-directors in the business today. <br /> <br />When you watch 'Firefly,' if you feel the same way I do - and hundreds of thousands of fans have - you'll understand why helping it live on is a labor of love.  When it's done, you can't believe there's not more, and thank God that 'Serenity' was made. <br /> <br />It has elements for everyone to love - quirky characters, action, space, romance, mystery - it's all there.  I've never seen anything quite like it, and if I could buy it as a gift for everyone I knew, I would. <br /> <br />Give this show a chance and it'll grab a piece of your heart.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I really like this CD(s). Great performances, wonderful arrangements with interesting dynamics, and a lot of humor.  <br />
B0001Z363W|5.0|I was familiar with Zakk from Ozzy.  But never really gave him a real listen unitl \\" Hangover Music\\".  Boom - right off the bat the first track (Crazy or High) got me.  His voice is unique (being nice), but works with the dynamics of his music.  I was expecting a harder edge even with the CD's title.  But it works and is put together nicely.  \\"House of Doom\\" & \\"Damage is Done\\" are highlights.  Very solid disk.  Got me to go back and download his earlier stuff which is amazing.  You get what you get, and I like that.  No pretense, just flat out rock....
0553801503|3.0|I loved the previous books in this series.  I thought the third book was the best; every single chapter had a wow moment. <br /> <br />A Feast for Crows, unfortunately, does not live up to its predecessors.  I understand that Martin had to split this book in two and put many characters in the next book.  Why, then, did he have to add a bunch of new, unknown, uninteresting minor characters?  I didn't know who these characters were and I didn't much care about them.  There are already too many characters to keep track of.  After four years of waiting, I can't even remember who all the old characters are and what they were doing.  Like others, I, too found it tedious to finish this book. <br /> <br />Then, after taking four years to get this book out, Martin has the audacity to leave not one, but several, cliffhangers.  I guess that's okay.  By the time the next book comes out, I probably won't remember them.
074322454X|5.0|In a world where the heroes to many are sports stars, rappers and actors, it is refreshing to read an account of men who were truly heroic in all they did.  This volume by the treasured Stephen Ambrose is an account of the 101st Airborne, the men of Easy Company.  Led by Dick Winters, this book follows them from the days of training at Currahhee, to their jump into France on D-Day.  We are able to accompany them on their trek through France and into Germany all the way to Hitler's lair, the Eagle's Nest.  This is an excellent companion to the HBO miniseries; I read it as a viewing guide.  A truly outstanding book about a select group of the greatest generation.
0671042858|4.0|This is only the second book I've read by Stephen King.  The only other book that I've read is \\"Carrie,\\" and I have to admit that it nor this particular novel was very scary to me.  However, King tells a great tale with his writing style.  His is a very addictive style that gives you just enough (but seemingly never enough until the end) information that keeps you plugging along trying to figure out what is going on each tale.<br /><br />In \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\\" King's central character, Trisha McFarland, gets lost in the woods of New England when she steps off of the path for a little restroom privacy.  Her bickering mother and brother are already well ahead of her, and when she's finished her business in the bushes, she realizes that she is lost.  This begins the long and obviously eerie tale of a little girl lost in the woods trying to make it home.  While lost, she begins to have conversations with Tom Gordon, who at the time of the story was actually the closer for the Boston Red Sox.  She adores him and \\"that little thing\\" he does on the mound after a save.  She also talks with her father, whose divorce from their mother have affected Trisha and her brother.  She manages to survive on chips, a Surge drink, a tunafish sandwich and bottled water until they run out.  Then she takes to gathering berries (and eventually a couple of other things) in order to survive.  All the while there is a \\"thing\\" in the woods that is literally stalking her and, in her mind perhaps, is waiting for the perfect moment to strike.<br /><br />King manages to keep the line between reality and near-insanity rather blurry throughout this book.  The reader never really knows if what Trisha is experiencing is really happening or it's all in her head.  Even the ending leaves the reader wondering about what she exactly experienced.<br /><br />This is not going to be my last King novel.  In fact, I think I'm addicted.  When I was nearing the end of this book, I went out and purchased the serial novel \\"The Green Mile.\\"  I've seen the film that was based on it and I hope it's just as good or better.  King has definitely earned his place on my bookshelf.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Just in case you were wondering, Tom Gordon is an actual baseball player.  He's had stints with a couple of teams since leaving Boston, including the New York Yankees.  He is currently with the Philadelphia Phillies, but there have been talks of him going back to NY to return to his roll as set-up man for Mariano Rivera.<br /><br />Also, Trisha believes that she is being stalked by something in the woods.  That \\"something\\" may or may not have been a black bear.  King makes you think that a black bear is the culprit, but even Trisha's rescuer wasn't quite sure if it was a black bear or not.  However, there have been cases where black bears have literally stalked human prey.  As far as I know, none of them tracked their prey for the length of time that Trisha is stalked, but it could have actually happened.  This only adds to the eerieness that is part of being a little girl lost in the woods.<br /><br />Highly recommended read.urchased the serial novel \\"The Green Mile.\\"  I've seen the film that was based on it and I hope it's just as good or better.

0385507755|3.0|I read the book and enjoyed it.  However I am a bit peeved that James Frey is a congenital liar and has oversimplified drug and alcohol addiction.  This book will probably do nothing to most people suffering from drugs and alcohol.  It is merely a powder puff piece of conceit and extreme bravado.
B00000I07P|5.0|After exploding onto the scene in the 80's Bon Jovi proved that men in spandex and teased hair could rock just as hard as anyone out in the day to to this day. <br /> <br />Slippery When Wet is by far one of Bon Jovi's better albums and shows what 80's glam rock was all about. With such hits as \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" and \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" cemented Bon Jovi's hair print in glam metal history. <br /> <br />While these hits had us singing along (and we all still do) less known songs \\"I'd Die For You\\", \\"Let It Rock\\" and \\"Wild In The Streets\\" proved that bon jovi had staying power. and stay they have. <br /> <br />While other bands of the time, such as motley crue and poison, rocked about sex, drugs and rock and roll. Bon Jovi sung about love and hardship, which more people could listen to and find themselves in these posistions. How many times can you mention that you've lost your heart at the tropicana or that you you had a girl on your left and right and you know them well from the night before? <br /> <br />20 year later, in the 80's glam metal surge, Bon Jovi is the only group to still have put out albums between the 80's and now and still rock arena's with old favorites and new hits and yet when you think back, more over, you will remember the hits off Slippery When Wet. Proving that in the 80's no band could rock harder about life then Bon Jovi.
0451450523|5.0|I grew up with the movie, accidentally discovered in a movie rental store and recorded on a partially blank VHS tape. Through the years, the music and the butterfly's voice have stuck with me, following me during the years when the tape was deeply burried in a too large video collection. Growing up, unicorns were a central part of my life, which I attribute to this captivating story. During junior high and much of high school, this was a part of me I abandoned for slightly more mainstream interests. The movie was recently rediscovered, and in a whirlwind I was demanding the book (and a DVD version of the cartoon) for Christmas. <br /> <br />I consider myself something of a writer, and I pay very close attention to the writings of others. Beagle's is a very poetic voice, and it never once wavers. Many authors punch out a few memorable lines and surround them with generics, but Beagle's style is consistent and beautifully so. <br /> <br />The story is even better, which really isn't a surprise - it's rare to find a movie that's better than the book on which it is based. I particularly loved Schmendrick, who was delightfully entertaining in the cartoon but rather lacking in depth of character. He, along with Molly Grue and the unicorn, was much more fleshed out. Dimensions to these characters hidden in the film were revealed, and they added so much more to the story. <br /> <br />Of everything, I most enjoyed the poetic voice. It is a book you can read simply for the beautiful, lyrical language, if nothing else. <br /> <br />I can't wait until December of this year for the live action movie, the script of which was written by Beagle himself (like the cartoon). There is so much that can be done with this book, but I highly doubt anything can surpass it.
B00080ZG10|2.0|Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Loved the TV series and was very sad that it ended. There aren't too many TV series that are worth one's time but those that are grab your heart (Northern Exposure, St. Elsewhere, Rockford Files, Barney Miller,Malcolm in the Middle, and a few others....) and Firefly grabbed hearts in our household. Then came Serenity: We LOVE this movie!! It is a great big swashbuckling, fast,non-stop action,sweet,funny, poignant,exciting, original, brilliant movie that just picks you up and sweeps you along and finally drops you back in your seat in the end, all sweaty and wrung out. Give yourself a little recovery time and then it's, \\"Let's watch it again!\\"  NOt only that, but it's, \\"Let's buy it for everybody we know!\\"  If Joss Whedon and any of the cast and anyone else responsible for bringing this movie to us ever reads these reviews: thank you! THIS is what movies should be. Thank you!!
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I honestly love this movie. I have read the most terrible reviews online and no one seems to like it. I don't get it. The actors are great, the story works, the ending doesn't leave you being annoyed and there isn't much violence except toward the end. <br />Halley Berry is fantastic and the hard work I hear she put in paid off well. The soundtrack is brillant and the way Patience deals with her love relationship doesn't leave open ends or left out bits. The only thing I wish is that I had seen it on the big screen. <br />All in all a great movie.

0143036556|5.0|I just finished reading this beautifully written, clear exposition of the state of the world's environment.  We are in serious trouble, folks, and anyone who denies this is simply not facing reality, or prefers not to.  This is no extremist text; it's well-balanced, praising of those companies, such as Chevron, which go all out to protect the environment in their own self-interest as well as of the world's.  I would hardly call this book an aimless meander around the globe searching for arguments, as one reviewer implied, or a plea to stop anything productive or fun as another stated, absurdly in my opinion.  Instead, it gives a detailed picture in clear language of the collapse of a variety of historic and present-day societies, as well as some of the dramatic successes, and applies the lessons to the present predicament we find ourselves in. Great analyses!  A real eye-opener for me.  Also, many references for further reading and research.  We're all in this together and we have to work together to avoid a future planetary collapse. It's as \\"simple\\" as that.
0790729369|4.0|This isn't a movie that will hit you on the head and change your life - it's smaller than that. If anything, it's about how the simplest things sometimes have more depth than anyone would imagine. Beautifully directed by Robert Redford who has the wisdom to let Streep and Eastwood just *be* - their chemistry is an unexpected and delightful surprise, with both actors putting in quiet, touching performances. It's Clint Eastwood as you've never seen him. A fine soundtrack adds to the overall quality of this film.  <br /> <br />My one complaint about Bridges of Madison County is the sub-plot, concerning the main character's adult children, which I find to be clunky and badly acted. More care should have been taken in casting these roles, as the actors have zero charisma - a stark contrast to Streep and Eastwood.  <br /> <br />Watch this one with someone you love.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|It's funny--I find myself agreeing with both the rave and the ravaging reviews of Serenity. I think it was a good, solid movie--an excellent sci-fi run, far above the typical Hollywood fare. Whedon and crew did a good job of wrapping up a major and involved storyline in a short space of time. Acting was generally high quality, special effects were excellent even on small budget, and the movie paced fairly well, dealt its blows where they needed to be, and managed (mostly) to avoid cheesiness and irrelevance. <br /> <br />But at the same time, Serenity is quite clearly a hasty farewell, a mere summation of what would have been. The story wraps up a pretty major arc (one of several) that was building in the first season of the show. Given the arc's scope and the nuances involved for the characters in running it out, it seems that it would have stretched on for some time on television. Compressed into feature length, though, it loses the space to make its contents truly memorable (and heartbreaking and wonderful), and instead feels more like an exciting synopsis than satisfying tale. <br /> <br />Serenity's atmosphere is also somewhat different from the TV series. The lighting is for some reason bluer than on the show, and a little bleaker, as if a little overexposed. Less sienna and brown, fewer seedy spaceports. And the characters feel as if they've been revisited after some time on the shelf, which seems to be the case. In it I can see what would have been a tremendous story, in which characters I love are drawn through a torturous gauntlet that tests and shapes all of them, makes them all indispensible. But series cancellation and a mere two hours of screen time isn't enough space to do the story, the characters, or the universe justice, though Whedon et al. do a truly amazing job with what they have. <br /> <br />In sum, see it, expect something great, expect resolution, but do not expect exactly the TV show you fell in love with. And be ready to let go of some things.

B000093004|5.0|This is by far my favorite blues CD from Gary Moore. I love the additon of horns, and with Albert Collins and B.B. King as guests, need I say more? Moore's guitar playing is nothing short of phenominal. Everything just comes together on this release. There are also (5) bonus tracks on this remastered copy. A real must for the Gary Moore fan and blues afficiando.
B00005JNX0|5.0|This movie is very funny!
B00006JSGQ|5.0|If you love Sailing to Philly and Shangri-La, or the great middle period of Dire Straits (Communique, Making Movies, Love Over Gold), you'll probably love this album. If you like/love Ragpicker's Dream by itself, the bonus tracks are worth an extra 5-8 bucks. If you're more into the Money for Nothing/Golden Heart Knopfler, this album won't interest you much.<br /><br />First, the bonus tracks, since many of you probably already own Ragpicker's Dream. The live \\"Why Aye Man, \\"Sailing to Philly,\\" and \\"Brothers\\" are all superb, with the final two being special treats. Nothing against James Taylor and his pitch-perfect voice, but it's a revelation to hear \\"Sailing\\" sung completely by the guy who's meant to sing it, IMHO. \\"Brothers\\" is beautiful, almost whispered by MK with mournful harmonica accompaniment by Mike Henderson. \\"Quality Shoe\\" is nice, tho there's not a heck of a lot there to begin with: why they picked that song to release a live version of is beyond me.<br /><br />The \\"enhanced\\" track is a live video of the bonus version of \\"Why Aye\\" with a sort-of \\"Knopfler supergroup,\\" recorded summer 2002 before his traffic accident. It features some wonderful close-ups of his guitar work, some nice sax from (I think) Chris White, and the welcome return of original Straits-er John Illsley on bass.<br /><br />As for the album itself, again, you probably already have it. I'll just say the first four tracks, along with tracks 6 and 7, show Knopfler at the peak of his powers: merging all sorts of styles into his own, writing and singing wonderfully original lyrics, and playing guitar unlike anyone else in the world. There's a slight dip in the album around \\"Coyote,\\" but the title track and the closing \\"Old Pigweed\\" are among the most heartbreaking songs he's ever recorded.<br /><br />People will be listening to this stuff in 100 years. Look for a good price and get the bonus tracks, and you'll own one heck of a 2-CD set.
B0006L16N8|5.0|My aunt bought this album for me. I play the piano. SO I automatically liked it. But the thing is if you are in a depressed mode I dont recommend you listen to it. Its really good but it will only worsen your mood. My favorite songs are \\"x&y\\", \\"Low\\", and \\"Fix You\\" and pretty much everything else. Chris Martin is a really good singer. I dont know how he was able to balance father hood with Gwyneth Paltrow although a second child is on the way. I just cant wait until their next album comes out. ITs not heavy metal there is no explicit content. Nothing bad at all! Its for anyone. Except when your in a depressing mode!

B00009W0U4|3.0|Some have called this movie stupid, arrogant, pretentious, and brutal. Others swear by its greatness.<br /><br />Gaspar Noe has offered a film which tops his I Stand Alone in its sheer ability to manipulate and horrify the viewer. Like Memento (although far more engaging), the film unfolds in reverse chronological order, and interesting technique which transforms a would-be-average revenge fantasy into a provocative meditation on the destructive nature of time.<br /><br />The film begins with distracting camera movements and overwhelming violence as several men avenge the rape of a young woman (a 10 minute scene that drove many critics from the theater at Cannes), and then descends into the realm of these people in their normal lives.<br /><br />The second half of the film is undoubtedly superior to the first because it dares to draw the viewer in whereas the first half merely smacks you in the face.<br /><br />The young actress Monica Bellucci, who is the recipient of appalling violence, is particularly exceptional in the final act. This film is difficult to place and will clearly be the subject of much discussion in the years to come.
0380789035|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  Gaiman is definitely one of the more imaginative and original SF/Fantasy writers of our time.  While the Old Gods v New Gods and reluctant messiah angles have been worked before, the quiet, down-to-earth tone and real-life settings of American Gods lend it a flavor which keeps your interest.  I live near and have visited some of the places in which this book takes place, so perhaps I'm getting something out of it which others might not: but I think that there's a realistic texture to this book that adds to the enjoyment.<br /><br />I do, however, think that \\"Neverwhere\\" is better.
0783228457|3.0|If you want to see a Hollywood movie that manages to avoid an intelligible plot be sure to see this. David Cronenberg's comical horror-show about James Woods, a TV programmer of garbage who's life spins a little off kilter as he becomes implanted with a \\"videodrome,\\" a kind of cartoonish tumor implanted by God-knows-what which then compels him to murder people. Funny and disgusting, and certainly a cult classic.

B00005R2M3|5.0|Laundry Service is Shakira's first release in her career of commercial success. She's had several albums to this point, but the phenomenon from Columbia has stepped away from her Spanish language music and made quite the impression on American audiences and English speaking music fans. The late Selena was slated to do this just before her untimely murder in 1995, and perhaps Shakira is enjoying the success that Selena would have had, as well as following the legacy formed by Selena in the music business.<br /><br />Shakira is quite unique. She's certainly not another pop music one hit wonder which appeals to teen audiences of Britney Spears. She's not a modern day Spice Girl or Debbie Gibson. She's not even another Alanis Morrisette, although that's the artist that I have most often seen her compared to. Shakira takes the best elements of pop music, dance, tango, Spanish cumbia, alternative rock, and electronica. She combines them all into a music that is totally her own. I'm truly amazed at her work on this album, as she hasn't abandoned her Columbian roots at all as she has embraced the American music scene. She's successful without selling out.<br /><br />\\"Objection (Tango)\\" starts this album off. Yes, it begins as a traditional tango, not that I'm an expert of that music of course. Then the drums kick in, and a guitar joins her voice as the song evolves to a danceable, toe tapping melody. The voice could belong to Alanis, in some spots, but I feel Shakira has more range in her voice. She's sexy, provocative, and intriguing while remaining crystal clear in her delivery, and above all, true to the soul of her music.<br /><br />The next track is \\"Underneath Your Clothes,\\" a riveting ballad. Shakira shows us in just two songs that she's not a one dimensional performer. Her voice is near perfect as she croons like the best of them. The guitar work is subtle but essential, keeping the song on track while allowing Shakira's voice to have center stage. Running with highs and lows in her voice, Shakira fills this one with emotion, and the listener can't deny the heart tugging it will produce.<br /><br />\\"You're a song<br /><br />written by the hands of God<br /><br />don't get me wrong cause<br /><br />this might sound to you a bit odd<br /><br />but you own the place<br /><br />where all my thoughts go hiding<br /><br />and right under your clothes<br /><br />is where I find them\\"<br /><br />Double meaning, just like I love a good lyric. This is one of those tunes that's romantic and heartfelt, yet still has just a hint at intimacy. Wow.<br /><br />The next tune was probably the most recognizable hit from the album: \\"Whenever, Wherever\\". Ok, this is where Shakira has fun. She picks up the beat again, and it is impossible not to move along in response to this one. It will make you wanna dance, it will make you wanna grind. It will make even the most uncoordinated soulless stiff shake a groove like Janet Jackson. It's a dance song, with enough Spanish influence to give it a fresh new feel. Her voice? Simply incredible. She rolls over the lyrics at a fast pace, keeping it clear and hitting the different ranges, going at a quick pace that certainly doesn't let the listener even consider falling behind.<br /><br />\\"Rules\\" is a good song, continuing a level of consistency Shakira started in the first track. \\"The One\\" could be a hit on its own. Another ballad, this one lures the listener into a state of relaxation, while triggering the feelings of passion that might otherwise lag behind. It's even better than \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" in its effect.<br /><br />\\"Ready for the Good Times.\\" Well, no doubt here. Shakira is not only ready to conquer the pop-rock world as she already has the Latin music genre, but she's having a blast doing so. So are we as we go along for the ride with her. The music is arranged perfectly on this one as well. This might be more \\"pop\\" oriented than some of the other ones, but it's still flawless. The instrumentation is truly an art all its own. (Shakira does co-write most of her own music, as well as pen almost all of her lyrics).<br /><br />\\"Fool\\" slows it down just a tad, and it is probably here that she sounds the most like Alanis. One can definitely hear the influence at least. \\"Poem to a Horse\\" gets some horns involved at the onset, but then slows down to a slowly moving pulse. The rhythm here takes a turn which reminds me of Depeche Mode, while keeping the comparisons vocally to Ms. Morrisette.<br /><br />\\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos As&iacute;)\\". Here we go, a new direction yet again. Could this star from Columbia be venturing in the direction of the Middle East? Perhaps Shakira is the second coming of Sherezade\\". Her story is one that is impossible to deny, and with each song I hear, I want just a little more, prolonging the moment where I'd have to turn the music off. The lyrics are alternating English and Spanish. It's sometimes hard to remember what culture you're in while listening, but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />This cd is amazing, from the first note of tango all the way thru to the final one. A Spanish lyric version of \\"Objection (Tango)\\" finishes the album off, right after a Spanish version of \\"Whenever, Wherever\\". Now, as much as I just praised the English versions of these songs, the Spanish versions are even better. Her voice fits the Spanish language, being her native tongue, and her comfort with it makes the difference. It's natural, and the Spanish language has such a sexy flow to it, her voice truly brings all of that quality out into song.<br /><br />There are two other Spanish  songs which appear on Laundry Service. \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" and \\"Que Me Quedes T&uacute;.\\" \\"Que Me\\" starts off with strings that could be R.E.M. at their best, then Shakira's voice slips over the top of the song like soft seductive silk. Her voice while using English is hypnotic and flawless. In Spanish, her voice is angelic, wrapping the listener up in a state of comfort and relaxation. \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" is not as powerful, but just as consistent as the rest of the work on this cd.art all its own.

B000AY74OG|5.0|I loved Madagascar.  It was really cute.  I love animals and the story line meshes so well with how I feel about animals in captivity.  It was truly funny, Chris Rock was great, they were all great actually.  This movie is a must watch for any age, it's just fun.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The self-titled cd released by Audioslave came out in 2002, much anticipated by rock fans everywhere. It was the biggest debut release by a hard rock act since A Perfect Circle a few years earlier. Chris Cornell, formerly of the grunge pioneer band Soundgarden, got together with the remants of the supergroup Rage Against the Machine, who were recently left without a singer.<br /><br />The result is the project all-star lineup of Audioslave. This CD is a showcase of the merger, and I'd have to say it's pretty incredible.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Cochise\\", and from the beginning we can hear Cornell's passion, always a strong point of his voice, coming thru strong. \\"Show Me How To Live\\" is next, having hit written all over it.<br /><br />All thru the album, there are reminders of both Soundgarden and RATM, but this is something fresh and new. The music has a Sabbath pulse at times, especially in tracks like \\"Gasoline\\". Cornell's voice, however, shifts from Blues to smooth to Brian Johnson (of AC/DC).<br /><br />\\"What You Are\\" is equally powerful. Every now and then, a Rage-like beat will kick in for a few moments, and then it'll slide into a heavy riff again, enabling Cornell to go to work. \\"Set it Off\\" and \\"Exploder\\" are two more songs where he reminds me of Brian Johnson. Course, Brian was never this loose.<br /><br />Two of my favorite songs on this CD are \\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"I Am The Highway\\". \\"Stone\\" has a funky little beat to lead off, one that is perfect for tapping along to while driving. By the time it gets to the meat of the song, chills will run up the spine as Cornell shifts to high and back to low notes. \\"Highway\\" could be a ballad, but isn't quite. It drives too much to be classified as such. But it's powerful.<br /><br />\\"Shadow On the Sun\\". This song requires a listen. Reminds me of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />\\"Hypnotize\\" almost has a Alice In Chains style to it, after inserting funky guitar.<br /><br />\\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\". Now this is Rage. Sorta. More Soundgarden maybe. A true hybrid of both bands.<br /><br />\\"Light My Way\\". Rage. Definitely. But with a Soundgarden pulse.<br /><br />\\"Getaway Car\\". Starting to wind down at this point. This slow track is reminiscent of the blues, setting the mood up just right for \\"the Last Remaining Light\\". Slow early Stones? I can hear the influence.<br /><br />The most incredible song on this album has to be \\"The Last Remaining Light\\". There aren't words to describe it properly. Haunting, melodic. That's a start. The lyrics set a mood, subduing the listener into a state of mind and being. As the final song, It is a perfect close to the album, leaving the listener wanting more yet satisfied at the same time. I have to wait several minutes before turning on something else after giving this a good listen. Savor the taste before it fades.<br /><br />There is no weak link on this album; each song is a beautiful piece of work all on its own. Packaged together, this is a damn good listening experience.<br /><br />I must say, as a longtime Soundgarden fan, that this is probably the best that I've heard from Chris Cornell. He has matured and developed his talent at both songwriting and singing. He wrote all of the lyrics on the album, and shared music songwriting credits with Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and Tim Commerford (the guys from Rage).<br /><br />The question will be on everyone's mind when giving this a good listen: Rage or Soundgarden? Which does it sound most like? My answer is this: Both. Neither. Yes. No. It's one part Rage Against the Machine. One part Soundgarden. Two parts classic hard rock. Two more parts fresh and new innovation.ve\\". Now this is Rage. Sorta. More Soundgarden maybe. A true hybrid of both bands. <br />  <br />\\"Light My Way\\". Rage. Definitely.

0316168815|5.0|Immediately into the story this reader grieved for the loss of life at a young age. Yet we are given a reprieve from the sorrow as Susie Salmon describes her special heaven where she enters into a calmer existence. The violence of her death isn't forgotten in her heaven, but she is sorting out a kind of 'peace' for herself. Her thoughts remain tuned in to her family as she watches the tension mount during the investigation of her killer and how her family tries not to completely unravel.<br /><br />  I was on edge through-out this novel. We ache for the murderer to be identified and brought to justice. This story had a special place in my heart, for I've also lost a young family member years ago and the murder is still unsolved. Sebold wove this path to understanding with delicate hands. There was one line that really hit home with this reader; 'When was it all right to let go not only of the dead but of the living-to learn to accept?'. No one unraveled by murder returns to a former sense of wholeness, but at the end of the novel the characters stop clawing for this and reach a place of comfort. I believe this novel will speak to many out there who are searching for that place in real life.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />author of 'Souls of the North Wind'

0345440900|5.0|I received this book as a gift when my baby was 2 weeks old.  I wished I had it sooner so I could have read it before she arrived and utilized this great advice from day one.  Nonetheless, as a first time mom, I have found this to be an invaluable resource.. I dog ear all the pages I continually reference!  It is very easy reading and all the advice is easily applied if you are willing and flexible. I have implemeted Tracy's strategies and find that my daughter is more contented and so is mommy!  I love the flexibility of her EASY schedule... and it has been very adaptable to our day and my baby's needs, and is much more realistic than \\"on demand\\".  It has also been helpful when others have watched her, as it helps them anticipate what she will need and when, therefore making their experience a postive one, and keep volunteering for more!  Another aspect that has been a lifesaver is her SLOW method and how to interpert your baby's cries and body language.  This assisted me to learn what she needed and helped me to avoid things like overfeeding or thinking she was tired when she was not.  This book is truly an essential for any expectant mom, and she will thank you endlessly for such a thoughtful gift! I know I am so grateful to the thoughtful mom that gave me my copy... it was her favorite book, and she did not find it until baby #8 and she now has 10! :)

B000002C1W|5.0|If for any minute you thought that Pink Floyd was finished without Roger Waters, Here's you answer. This is a Great album in all aspects. Sure, the lyrics may not be as twisted as was in previous records, but the awesome guitar work that IS Pink Floyd is evident all over this record. <br /> Lyrically, it pretty well captured what was going on in MY head in the 80'S. I was really able to relate and apply the mood of the songs to actual points in my life. The way David Gilmour approached this project was nothing short of genius. It reminded me of his solo album released in 1978. <br /> Beware of others who are still willing to trash Pink Floyd (David Gilmour)simply because Roger Waters left. Those people are just ignorant and don't appreciate good music. Try to imagine Pink Floyd without David Gilmour. That's like Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page. And we all heard Roger Waters without David Gilmour (unfortunately). Though the lyrics were pretty decent, The music behind him was nothing short of a train wreck. <br /> That being said, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason is an excellent album that is well deserving of the Pink Floyd name because after all, it IS Pink Floyd <br />
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack's ''Angel'' was used in its entirety in the cliff-hanger final episode of the fourth season of television's \\"The West Wing\\" entitled ''Twenty Five''.  As the sequence using the track begins, the president's daughter Zoey is clubbing in Georgetown, D.C. with her French boyfriend who slips her some ecstasy in a drink. When she excuses herself to the loo she is abducted by persons unknown and a Secret Service agent is killed in the alley behind the club. Parallel sequences inside the club as the alarm is raised and the reactions at the White House are deftly intercut over Massive Attack's brooding, ominous trip-hop, the house music as the scene begins.  I found the whole sequence mesmerizing. The episode's closing credits rolled over ''Angel''s fade giving effect of a Massive Attack set-piece.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|If you've never heard the first VH album, check out the excerpts here.  If you like metal it's a must-have.<br /><br />But here's a little historical perspective -- people these days often describe \\"Van Halen\\" as though it was the second coming of rock 'n' roll, and blasted through a musical wasteland consisting only of the Bee Gees and Village People.<br /><br />Kiddies, I was 15 going on 16 when the first VH album came along -- and I bought it within days of release -- and I'm here to tell ya, hard rock was probably never healthier than it was in early 1978.<br /><br />Consider a few things --<br /><br />John Bonham was alive, so Led Zep still existed.<br /><br />Keith Moon was still alive, so the classic Who line-up still existed.<br /><br />Bon Scott was still alive, so the classic AC/DC line-up still existed.<br /><br />Ozzy was still in Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Ted Nugent and Aerosmith had just started to stagnate.<br /><br />Blue Oyster Cult (with guitar phenom Buck Dharma) had become, briefly, an arena headliner.<br /><br />Up-and-coming acts included UFO (with guitar phenom Michael Schenker) and Judas Priest and Pat Travers Band and Blackfoot and the Scorpions.<br /><br />Hard-pop bands like REO Speedwagon and Styx and Foreigner and Toto hadn't started to really stink up the joint, and appeared to have the potential to kick butt.<br /><br />Lynyrd Skynyrd had lost their lead singer and lead guitarist to a plane crash the previous fall, but it looked like there was a chance they'd re-form and come back in a respectable way.<br /><br />And, ironically, Sammy Hagar wasn't a wanker -- check out his live album, \\"All Night Long,\\" which is pretty great.<br /><br />There's lots more I could say, but I'm sure you get the point.<br /><br />Thank you and goodnight.

B0000524CY|4.0|Ever get sick of the \\"horror\\" movies lately? Where some guys snoops around an old house/abandoned building/graveyard etc in the dark and some guy pops out of the screen and goes \\"HEY!\\"? Well these are called jump scenes or gotcha moments where it makes the audience jump. The recent movies are just this though and that's the problem: too many scenes trying to scare you when the film itself should do so, not the combined effect of individual scenes. The Exorcist was one of those films that doesn't really have any jump moments but there was enough in it to unnerve you a bit. <br /> <br />All's well in a nice house in the States except one thing: a young girl named Regan is possessed by a demon. Her odd demeanor certainly alarms her mother, an actress, as well as other housemates. Eventually Father Karras is called in as well as Priest Merrin to try and perform an exorcism to rid Regan of the demon. <br /> <br />Maybe it's just my standards have gotten a bit higher, or maybe the infamous scenes and images in the film have been parodied so many times that it takes away the shock of everything. Granted the film is unnerving and of course the subject matter isn't all fluffyness but the film didn't make me go \\"holy crap!\\". In fact the only time I ever jumped was when the sound got incredibly and a bit unneccesarily loud for one moment. <br /> <br />The film however shines in its acting with Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and of course Linda Blair. Unlike Jennifer Carpenter in Emily Rose, Linda didn't supply her odd voice but someone else but it still works as well anyway. The infamous spider walk scene has been restored and it's probably one of the more well-known scenes that was not in a film. <br /> <br />Disappointly are the extras which are basically 2-3 pages of text about things. No interviews? There is a commentary but not having making ofs or at least a retrospective would've helped. <br /> <br />Watch this one and avoid the 2nd one but give the 3rd a try, especially to watch the nurse scene, creeeppppy.
B000002LCX|5.0|There are two types of SMITHS fans, those that like THE QUEEN IS DEAD and those who appreciate STRANGEWAYS HERE WE COME (a perfect album that cracked into the mainstream and therefore must be crap to the self-loathing THE QUEEN IS DEAD fans).  I really like THE QUEEN IS DEAD, it is brilliant, but alas you simply are a dullard if you think THE QUEEN IS DEAD is better than STRANGEWAYS HERE WE COME.  My guess is that if THE QUEEN IS DEAD got as much airplay as STRANGEWAYS HERE WE COME, then you'd be saying that THE QUEEN IS DEAD sucks, and that LOUDER THAN BOMBS is the best album ever.

This was preceded by \\"The Final Countdown\\" and some dancing; F-ing brilliant. <br />I found a copy of this tape for like 50 cents. It was worth every penny. <br />The best thing to do is listen to, like, the first minute and 12 seconds of \\"The Final Countdown\\", rewind, and do it all over again...
B000002LRX|5.0|What can you say about Angel Dust? It has all been said before. However, every new generation has to be reminded of the importance of this band, and particularly this album. Faith No More changed the face of music, as it has produced Alternative music yet to be topped. This one has to be experienced, as it is one of the most important records of the 90s.  <br /> <br />I'm a Death Metal guy... that means I listen to: Opeth, In Flames, Soilwork, Arch Enemy, Bloodbath, Hypocricy, Carcass, etc. and I am the first to recognize Faith No More (with Angel Dust) as being the top of the line for Alternative music. I respect what they have done with this record, as they constucted a true masterpiece. An unorthodox masterpiece that requires many listens. Listen to this record and listen to history. If you're a fan of Rock/Metal/Alternative/Pop in any way, this album must be experienced.  <br /> <br />Faith No More is a band of champions. Mike Patton is a god among men.
B000003TA4|5.0|When I first got this album, I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I was five years old at the time. Still, to this day, the album just rocks. Simple music by adequate musicians with a minimal setup: one guitar, one bass, drums, period.  <br />The first track, \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\", was the first hit, if memory serves me correctly. Almost anthemic with any high-school class of the 90's; even in 2004 our class loved this song. Huge as it was, this song was not the best. <br />\\"Lithium\\", the fifth track, is probably my favorite. I say probably, because it is tough with songs like \\"Polly\\" \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come as you are\\".
B000002INJ|5.0|In the fall of 1991, I got talking to the only other guy on my floor of the Ole Miss dorms who was wearing a Metallica t-shirt, a guy named Mac Walsh. Irrelevant, but he deserves public recognition. Mac was also a transplant from Up North, New Jersey in his case, but then to most Ole Miss students, Nashville is the border into Yankee territory. Mac brought with him the biggest box of casette tapes in the history of the human race, almost all heavy metal. This was a guy who met Biohazard at the grocery store fer chrissake. The greatest band he turned me on to was Manowar. I'm having to replace my copy of \\"Kings of Metal\\", two tours of Iraqi sand have ruined it.

B000ANVQ0K|1.0|This movie is really bad. I never understood why this movie won 11 Oscars. The actors are very bad in this movie, especially Leonardo di Caprio and most of the scenes are unbelieveble and stupid (di Caprio with his arms extended and yelling \\"I am the King of the world is ridiculous. Kate Winslet's character really sucks. How can she fall in love with such a jerk!!! It doesn't make any sense.There were much, but much better movies in 1997 The plot: The commonplace: the rich girl falls for the poor but goodhearted guy. That's it. Come on! Except( maybe)  for the special effects, you don't get anything from this movie. Don't buy this piece of garbage! They can release it in any form. That's not going to change the fact that this movie SUCKS. Don't waste your money. Save your money for something better.
B000002JSP|5.0|\\"...zeppelin is zeppelin. It is the stepping stones to the music of today and tomorow.I love them and i always will.\\" Led Zeppelin first came on to the scene with a blues basis, but took those roots and put a crazier spin on them, influencing heavy metal worldwide.  <br /> <br />        I think music is a way of expressing one's self, so I believe Led Zeppelin's heaviness eventually subsided because they had already expressed themselves with their many rock albums they decided to try a slightly softer style. <br /> <br />       On their first record tracks such as \\"I Can't Quit You Baby,\\" and especially \\"Black Mountain Side,\\" weren't an heavy anyway. They finished the way they begun as it should be, a quiet start to a quiet end. <br /> <br />       Personally, I think this is a great album and still shows their wonderful musicianship. <br />   <br />

B000006MS3|5.0|THE DREAMING, now more than 20 years old, is still the most inaccessible work Kate Bush has produced. As such it is probably least favorite on many a listener's list, even among her fans. It's not a dance record, it doesn't have many \\"catchy\\" melodies (at least by pops' modern simplistic standards), and it doesn't really make great background music. It was also somewhat less than a commercial success at it's release. In short, it is not a pop record. <br /> <br />These are not criticisms, however. The album flies in the face of standards by which modern music seems to be judged, and defies categorization on those terms. It reaches for a high level of craftsmanship and musical excellence that demands close attention by the listener. That kind of attention was falling out of fashion in the '80's when the album was released, and is certainly out of fashion with the current iPod mania; but THE DREAMING deserves that attention. The album is full of rich textures, a huge palette of sound, complex rhythms and melodies, samples, effects and studio wizardry. Most songs remain fresh sounding (although the 'orchestra hit' sound, the first ever recorded, is now so cliched as to take away a little of the force of the title song). The songwriting is adventurous at its least points; at its best, nothing short of brilliant. Drumbeats stop and start as needed, dynamics are exceptional for its idiom, the variety of instrumentation is large (but never feigning the overused 'world music' trappings) and all is in service to - and in harmony with - the subject of the music. Nothing is out of place, yet nothing is held back, and Kate's voice goes from half sung whispers to animalistic screams, a showcase of range arguably only challenged by some of Bjork's recent work. There is a sense of passion about the music here that Bush hasn't really equaled (although she came close with \\"The Ninth Wave\\", the concept suite of songs from her album THE HOUNDS OF LOVE). <br /> <br />These music piecesare not abstractions, nor are they so experimental and removed from the norms of pop music influences as to be ranked with John Cage or Steve Reich. Kate Bush is a storyteller, and the story has never been in more focus than here. She envelopes us in a sonic storytelling experience that perhaps only Peter Gabriel has challenged in the rock/pop music culture (which is appropriate, since some of her inspiration for the album came from sessions she did on Gabriel's third self titled solo effort). The emotional payoff for the listener is rich and varied: joy, anger, excitement, desperation, fear, regret and more are communicated here in the characters she describes, follows and inhabits like short one act plays. I don't think it can all be received properly on one or two listens, certainly not on a casual listen as we're so used to these days. And it's that multilayered structure that will help it stand the test of time. <br /> <br />Kate recently released a new album as of this writing, ARIEL, after a decade of silence. I'm glad she's still writing, but THE DREAMING came at a unique time in her musical development, and we may never again be fortunate enough to receive from her its stylistic equal. That makes this one all the more special, and almost unique even in her own body of work. Some might find her musical adventures here a \\"difficult listening hour\\", to quote an old comedy sketch. They may find RED SHOES. ARIEL or one of her first 2 albums more palatable. But for those who want to experience a creative at her musical zenith, this underrated and misunderstood masterpiece is the album to hear.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I did not see the TV series that this was based on (Firefly?) but a friend tipped me off that it was a good show and I saw it, even though sci-fi is not usually my cup of tea.  But it was a very entertaining film.  The action was fast-paced, flowed well and there was not too much of it.  The story line was intriguing and kept you guessing.  The acting was pretty good (some better than others) but overall a very decent job.  It was a sci-fi film with a western feel to it.  Recommended for anyone in search of a good movie.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is one of those shows that will be welcomed years down the road.  I think having the CD set would be appreciated when it is not longer possible to find the show on!  The beautifully balanced drama, comedy and human story unfold each week until you realize that you feel like you know each character on the show and that you care about how their story unfolds.  Really one of the better shows to come along in a very long time.  Season one is an immediate draw and it never lets up.  You will love each episode.
0060920084|2.0|I'm sorry I didn't read all the reviews on this before I got the audio book from the library - I would have learned more about this horrible audio book.  Bill Bryson usually reads his own books and that's really the only way it can be with Bryson's books, because his humor doesn't translate well in other people.  Kerry Shale, the fellow reading the book, reads very quickly (too much caffiene that day?) and while his change in voices is good, the overall effect is very bad.  I listened for about 20 minutes and since the story was slow in developing I had to turn it off.  If you read this one, read the actual book and don't listen to it!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Disappointing.  Coming from Madonna, I truly expected much more.  The dance tracks are generic-sounding.  If you're in a club, surrounded by sweaty half-naked people, and partially stoned, the music is fluffy and can/will make you feel good.

D.B. Sweeney <br />plays Travis Walton whose abducted one cold night in <br />Arizon in 1975. <br /> <br />What follows is a large amount of hysteria on the case. <br />Is he really missing or did his friends murder him? <br /> <br />Once he is found, is this still a large hoax? <br /> <br />As the movie shows us, none of this is true, and Walton <br />through some flashbacks and some physical abuse that <br />results in seizures relieves the terror he faced <br />while being abducted. <br /> <br />It does sound absurd but so far no one has been able <br />to discredit him either. <br /> <br />This is a good movie. The aliens look evil and scary, <br />Walton's little escapade inside the alien ship has <br />to be one of the most memorable moments in Sci-Fi <br />movie making history.

The only film I've seen that delves into such depths of what it means to care for another person with all one's might, and yet be forced struggle to survive that love in this harsh world, is the Brazilian film &#34;Central Station&#34; (Walter Salles, 1998).  I was pleased to see the theatre packed with a widely diverse audience, following no guidelines according to race, gender, or age. It is a testament to the film's universality.  Bravo, Ang Lee!
1400031087|5.0|Frey's book was highly recommended in a book the summer before called \\"Too Many Books, Too Little Time.\\" I devoured that one - making my list - getting and reading  many great titles. Disturbingly unforgettable was Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" which I highly recommended to my Shepherd University Professor of Contemporary Literature (I was a 49-yr-old returning student at the time) and to all of my literary friends. She was very intrigued and I hope she works it into her course load. NOT ONLY, was this a very hard tale to tell, of severe drug and alcohol use at a young age and its impact on the user's family (though I was totally into its effect on  Frey's  psyche and how HE dealt with it), it was also succinctly written in Frey's inimitable style which for all its originality somewhat reminded me of e.e. cummings' unorthodox and usually lighthearted poetry. <br />Frey is a talented writer and  has created a style suited to his disjointed memories. The author who recommended his book even wrote her chapter about it in his own broken powerful way. <br />How lucky we are that Frey had the talent to artistically, and most often very graphically, describe his ordeal. I CARE NOT what small portion might not be to the letter. He has magnanimously bared the horror of his ordeal. This book will redeem itself for decades. It is on my top 10 personal recommended list of non-fiction reads. And, all along, since reading the book, I hoped that Frey had survived long-term. (I didn't know...) He took as much space in my brain as did the varying fates of my own family members. I think I would have been shattered into \\"a million little pieces\\" had he not survived. - Nel Glover, Shepherdstown, WV 25443 (304-724-6344).
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is great.  It really gives a point of view that I do not think has been captured by the big screen before.  I look forward to it's release on DVD so I can purchase it.   <br /> <br />If you are the slightest bit interested in seeing this movie, you will not be disappointed. <br />
B000002KBA|5.0|This whole album jams fom top to bottom:) <br />Speed King- need you say more <br />Bloodsucker- my favorite, Richie and John dueling this one out <br />Child Of Time- future often mentioned <br />Flight of the Rat- another favorite jam from them <br />Into the Fire-out of the case into the cd player <br />Living Wreck- perrrrfect construction of a song <br />Hard Lovin' Man- most men consider to be, but still good little number <br /> this whole album is like rock n' roll on speed, from Ian Gillans screams, to Ian Paice bashing the drums to smitherines, and John Lord playing his organ like it was a Gibson Les Paul being played by Jimmy Page, and of course Richie Blackmore's aggressive attempt to pervert rock to its roots. This album is pure, and too bad it never gets airplay, this is a gem worth getting indeed.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Since seeing Ponne's La Cenerentola on Public Television, I have been checking Amazon every week.to find out whether it had been released on DVD.  This is the perfect production of an opera.  The cast, direction, settings, and orchestra are perfect.  It presents opera buffo in its finest form.  It is beautiful, funny, and presents a world where goodness wins.  Watching this DVD is a sure remedy for the blues and is just a lot of fun. Thank you for letting me watch this opera again.
B000000W5N|5.0|You can argue, it's either this one or Exile...., well for me this one. I like all the tracks here including Sister Morphine which gets no airplay, nor does the Santana sound-alike Can't You Here Me Knocking? Of course you got you regulars like Brown Sugar, Wild Horses, or even Bitch on top of that, but this album is all great all the way around with hard core blues like You Gotta Move or I Got The Blues. This album is worth giving to your hungry collection.
0385507755|1.0|If parts of the book that had a definate paper trail were made up.......it's only natural to assume alot more was fabricated.....especially since there's no possible way to verify much of the book.  Everyone seems to be dead or fake.  With the exception of the author, no doubt.   <br />The respect I had for this author went down the toilet with yesterday's lunch.  Like most recovered addicts who have read the book.....I feel \\"chumped\\".  James Frey is just another Richie Rich with a bevy of mental issues (compulsive lying being at the top of that list) who drank alot and made up stories.   <br />You've got no street credibility, James.  And trust me.....street credibility goes a long way with this particular group of people.
B000002KIE|5.0|What a better way to vent at anyone than with this particular album, gripes!!! I love it, got this on CD about two years ago, and I can say this is what started punk indeed, but I also think they were the originals not the Stooges, well maybe the Velvets, well maybe not. Holiday In The Sun, fantastic, No Feelings, God Save The Queen, good and evil indeed. Anarchy In The UK, I thought so, at least the punk district. Pretty Vacant, pretty ugly here. This is a disgusting piece of work that should be in every home, especially day care centers for seniors. Go and raise hell with this gem.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This film surprised me for several reasons. Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors, but X-Men United shows improvement on almost every front.  The acting is solid, the effects and filming are even more amazing than before, and the plot is head and shoulders better than the first, which was in many ways a rehash of the comic books.  This is a testament to the work of Bryan Singer (also responsible for King Kong) and the writers, and proof that popular entertainment does not have to be completely banal.<br /><br />The story kicks off when the president's office is invaded by a mutant.  A demonic looking teleporter who seems to be a representative of a mutant's lib movement.  A barb tailed terrorist who is, for all purposes, unstoppable.  In the chaos that ensues William Stryker (Brian Cox) steps in with a plan to invade Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school and capture the mutants.  The attack is only partially successful, and it quickly becomes clear to the viewer and the X-Men that Stryker's agenda is more than defending the president.  He wants to destroy all mutants driven by his own anger over Xavier's failure to 'cure' his son.<br /><br />Cox is brilliant as the psychotic Stryker, and with a villain so despicable that Magneto seems almost likeable, you will quickly become emotionally involved in the race to keep all out war from breaking out between the increasing number of mutants and populations that feel threatened by those whose powers seem almost magical.  As such, the story becomes a parable of human fear in the face of things beyond our control and how quickly that turns to anger and violence.<br /><br />The film introduces many new faces that will become more important in later films (such as the so far ill-fated X-Men 3).  Pyro (John Allerdyce), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), for example.  The latter, by the way turns in an outstanding performance in a supporting role.  Hats off to the unsung heroes who do the animation and effects work as well - everything seems smooth and seamless.  By all means make a point to see this if you haven't already.o the animation and effects work as well - everything seems smooth and seamless.

B000002UA2|4.0|I've said this to many, and many ageed that this album has the quality sounds of Dark Side with the title track, or even a little bit of Wish you Were Here on Wot's ..uh the Deal, in the acoustics of course. I must say, I stumbled on this prize two years ago and it gets regulary played, alot more than Dark Side even. I also like the Childhood's End track on here, there you go again, this little number sounds like Eclipse, at least the organ part of the song. I also liked Free Four, kind of morbid, but then again that's Floyd for you, or Waters I might add. Yeh it's fair to say that this album gets underrated, yet no airplay on the radio, and yet just as good as the next album by Floyd that got 700 weeks on the chart. This is a must for you Floyd fans out there.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The only down fall I have with this DVD release is that the film is split between two DVD's. But, I imagine with all of the special extras loaded into this set it was impossible to put it on one DVD and still have a good picture. <br />This DVD is enhanced for Widescreen TV's and looks better than the origianl release a few years ago. The extras are out of this world also. Not to mention some special footage of the actual Titanic in her resting place. Cameron goes inside of the actual Titanic and shows us rooms and things that have not been seen since she went down in 1912. Cameron is very respectful to Titanic while he is exploring her rooms and artifacts. If you have the previous DVD release, this set will blow it away.
B000009HF2|4.0|One thing is true about Frampton by far, he was a lot better live than in studio, go figure, it's suppose to be the other way around. This whole album kicks serious butt, but the reason for 4 stars is would be for the fact the monsters from radio constantly replays the usuals on this set of his live concerts from 1975. The highlight of this album as any classic rock lover would know is Do You Feel Like I Do, all thirteen minutes of it, don't ever get sick of that. I grew up hearing Show Me The Way, and of course another favorite on this album Baby, I Love Your Way. The other tracks on this album are packed with a punch too including Shine On, (I'll Give You) Money, and slower pace Lines On My Face. If you still have this on vinyl, save that needle and pick this gem up on CD and as always, ENJOY!!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|If you get only one real revelation from seeing Brokeback Mt.,then it is this...That Love is a universal force of nature!  <br /> It reconizes nether race, nor class, religion, sex or sexuality. It can exsist in any time or place. And it is the one <br />true force that all living things respond to. <br /> So it doesn't matter that Jack and Ennis are men. <br />What only matters is that they are in love.  <br />And this is the joyous, yet sad thing about this movie. That love is never a smooth primrose path. But more like a rocky back road, that we more often just stumble across. <br /> It's a visually stunning movie. That's brilliantly directed by Ang Lee. <br /> And the performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, <br />are what Oscar awards were created for! <br /> Go see this movie. With an both an open heart and open mind! <br />   <br />  <br />
B00005JOIF|4.0|Eric Bana leads a ... well, they don't shine, but they do a *marvelous* job playing the courageous, conflicted, sort-of heroes of -Munich-.  After the murder of the Isreali athletes in Munich, Avram [Bana] is ... chosen to lead a group of men to avenge the cold-blooded murder of innocents.<br /><br />Beyond the Mossad, outside the Israeli chain of commmand, Avram and his cohorts -- a toymaker-turned-bomb-maker, an ID forger, a 'clean up' man, & a shooter -- slowly track down those who killed the Olympians.  With the aid of \\"Louis\\", a Frenchman whose family stays outside both government *and* law, they pursue and execute the guilty Palestinians.  In the process, they slowly lose who they are ... and prove that 'eye for  an eye' vengeance leaves all parties blind.  Even in his execution of the Dutch beauty who murdered his cleaner [Geoffrey Rush], Avram is relentless in his Holy Vengence.<br /><br />But ... whose Holy Vengeance?  In one of the most telling bits of the tale, Avram &c end up sharing a 'safe house' w/Ali a Palestinian who work for -- surprise! -- the PLO.  Ali also feels the need for a homeland, & insists it's 'Palestine' ... Israel that was.  & he, too, is avenging the innocents who've been murdered: in Palestinian refuge camps.  W/each side certain of their righteous cause, only bloodshed & sorrow can follow -- and they do.  Even in his retirement, Avram sees the murder of the Olympian Israelis again and again and again...
0872860175|5.0|This book is totally amazing. I have read a lot of Ginsberg's work and I love it all. I am only 14 and I don't get why people think this is so inapropriate! I mean sure, it can get racey at times and maybe for some people it could be too much but it is art! Art is beautiful so why does profanity matter if it is written in an elegant way. And he isn't just swearing for fun, Ginsberg and all his peers were trying to get a message across. That message is a good one, one we should all pay a little more attention to because it applies just as much to today as it did back then in the 50's. The Beat style of writing is inspiring and beautiful, the way the words flow on the page and the rhythm to it all. This collection of poems totally rocks, from his classic and most famous poem Howl, to his firery America, and the wonderful Sunflower Sutra. When I was first introduced to the Beat generation work I thought, oh, okay, this looks sorta interesting... but as soon as I started reading I became utterly imersed. Because of the work of poets like Ginsberg I have been inspired. These writings are what made me want to become a writter and a poet when I am older. Ginsberg was right when he said, \\"Poet is Priest.\\" <br /> <br />      -GIVE PEACE A CHANCE
B00003CXV4|3.0|Yes, I know this movie has some contrived plot points -- don't all love stories? -- but I liked it overall because it was romantic and beautiful, and sometimes that is all you need from a movie. I particularly enjoyed experiencing the gorgeous San Francisco settings while a blizzard raged outside my home. IMO, the stars of this updated version are more appealing than the  stars of the first version, which I didn't much enjoy. Charlize is lovely and expressive (easy to believe men find her irresistible) and Keanu is NOT wooden. (You want to see wooden? Watch a Rock Hudson movie!) Keanu is, as always, handsome and natural in a restained, manly way. There always seems to be something held back inside him, causing many women to fantasize about accessing that mystery. In a Tom Cruise fist-pumping world, not everybody may appreciate a guy like this, but millions of Keanu fans do. So if you liked Something's Got to Give or A Walk in the Clouds, you'll like this film, too.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Polar Express is one of the most touching movies I have ever watched. It has been added to my library as a much watch every holiday season.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|Hostel starts off rather slow posing as a dark sex comedy with random laughs and plenty of t&a (breast and rear nudity) ..as three men venture to another country on vacation, their want(s) for casual sex lead them to a strange and macabre part of the world that most movie goers hope doesnt really exsist. As the plot progressed i realized that a bloodbath was around the corner. The film soon reveals that it is about human torture and the price some insane people will pay to be givin the opportunity to torture and kill a foreigner. As I watched the movie I glanced next to me at the elderly woman to my right, she appeared to be disgusted by the film and its harsh sexual dialogue, nudity and graphic gory violent content. I tell you this because i don't recommend the film to senior citizens and children whom i saw plenty of in the theater today.. However, I do recommend it to adult horror fans that love a gross good time at the movies!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie has many points going against it. Uma is not all that believable as the world deadliest woman assasin. The stunts are adequate, but not spectacular. Quentin steals ideas from really bad movies. The movie is homage to various kung fu, karate, shogun, spaghetti westerns, Japanese revenge movies. The action sequences are over the top. Quentin throws in cutsey touches. For example, the cutsey flashback scene when we learn \\"The Bride's\\" real name.  <br /> <br />However, the movie works for me. Uma plays the Bride like a female Clint Eastwood: strong and quiet. The character may not be believable, but she is sympathetic and entertaining. The plot works and how Quentin tells the story keeps the story interesting through both volumes. Both volumes viewed as one movie is a masterpiece. How Quentin ties the movie together is amazing. He uses the different cinematic styles to reveal plot points and character development. The characters are complex and their relationships are interesting. It is hard to give the movie justice in just a few words. There is poetry here in how Quentin tells his story and he fully entertains at all times.
1401308201|3.0|First off, I'm a fan of the musical, saw OBC, waiting in line for 5 days to get lotto tickets. So I'm a big fan.<br /><br />I was extreamly dissapointed. The main reason I buy these books is not for pictures of the cast (I was horrified to see the full page almost centerfold of Fyero) but for the entierty of the script. The hack job of the script almsot made me not want to get the book. The pictures are good and some of the information is very interesting.<br /><br />I was also annoyed by the blatent advertising. I don't need to know who played after OBC. Really, If they had spent more time on making the book better they wouldn't have needed filler information about the touring cast (information which will outdate the book in about one year!) At times it felt like an over blown program rather then a book.<br /><br />All in all, a good book if you really like the musical, or if you like looking at the pictures. but not if you haven't seen it.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|Don't be fooled into believing these are the \\"original\\" three Star Wars movies.  The films George Lucas is passing off as the \\"Classic\\" Trilogy are actually the 1997 (and later) tinkered abominations, the so-called \\"Special Edition\\" versions. That's an important point, because despite what some professional movie reviewers are saying, the changes George Lucas has made have altered the original storyline and character development in profound ways. <br /> <br />What Lucas is doing now is called Revisionist History.  He's passing this trilogy off as being \\"original\\" or \\"classic\\" and hoping that, in time, the public will only remember his tinkered versions. Until he understands that the original movies mean as much to his fans and to history as the special editions mean to him, we are stuck with the updated films. <br /> <br />If you want the TRUE original trilogy, look for the widescreen VHS versions from 1995, or find a copy of the LaserDISC versions posted on an auction website.
0553565915|5.0|I can not tell you how many of these books I have bought. When my mother passed away I found this book and have read it at leat 100 times. I have given it to friends at work they have asked me to order more copies for them so they can give it to their friends. My brother passed away of cancer and his wife and my aunt have both praised this book for helping them. It is also the type of book when you are just troubled you pick it up and read it and it gives you great comfort. I HIGHLY tell you to buy this and give it as a gift to someone who has lost someone near and dear to them. I will be buying more copies.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book before the Smoking Gun scandal. As the child of an alcoholic who committed sucide, I found the book to be an accurate portrayal of addiction and the affects on the family left in the wake. If he embelished for literary sake, that does not bother me and I would still recommend this gripping story. The core of the book focuses on his relationships with the people around him and his personal demons. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an intense, emotional literary experience.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|To speak frankly, when i listened their last album's single \\"Juicebox\\" it was a little dissapointing for me since the sound was more-less like most of the current bands. Also the fact that Gordon Raphael did not produce this album had me with a lot of doubts regarding the album's quality. Fortunately i can say that after listening to the album I can say that The Strokes still are the greatest rock band today. And i will always be grateful to The Strokes because thanks to them, rock and roll is still alive despite the tendency to push foward hip hop and soul music by the guys from MTV, the only reason we can still tune to rock radio stations is because of The Strokes, Interpol and The white Stripes, and The Strokes opened the door to the rest of the good bands to be listened and enjoyed. Congratulations Julian Casablancas for your album, THE STROKES ARE STILL THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL!!!!!!

0684824906|3.0|Goodwin gives an interesting overview of Lincoln's leadership style but is again lauding his \\"genius\\" and seeming superior talent while ignoring obvious flaws. In fact, Lincoln was distrusted within his own administration, and alienated men who could have been allies with his convictions that whatever he did was morally right, such as the grandson of Francis Scott Key (composer of the national anthem), Francis Key Howard, the editor of the Baltimore Exchange. Key was arrested by Lincoln and imprisoned at Fort McHenry. On September 13, 1861, and wrote: \\"The flag which (my grandfather) had then so proudly hailed, I saw waving at the same place over the victims of as vulgar and brutal a despotism as modern times have witnessed.\\" When he was finally released on November 27, 1862 he wrote: \\"We came out of prison just as we had gone in, holding the same just scorn and detestation [for] the despotism under which the country was prostrate, and with a stronger resolution that ever to oppose it by every means to which, as American freemen, we had the right to resort.\\" <br /> <br />Lincoln was indeed possessed of some political genius, which he showed in writing the Emancipation Proclamation, possibly the most impressive piece of propaganda ever composed. Lincoln issued this \\"edict\\" in 1862 and its sole purpose (far from freeing slaves) was to give the North a seeming moral high ground and thus keep England and France from granting foreign recognition to the Confederacy. In reading this document one must wonder who if anyone was freed, since it applied only to states currently in rebellion (meaning the Confederacy, where he had no authority) and the third paragraph goes on to specifically EXCLUDE northern slave states and territory retaken by the Union army. In answer, Lincoln actually freed no one at all. <br /> <br />Goodwin glosses over Lincoln's racism with quotes from men such as Frederick Douglass while overlooking Lincoln's own writings. On June 26, 1857, Lincoln made an address in Springfield, Illinois, and stated, \\"A separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation, but as immediate separation is impossible the next best thing is to keep them apart where they are not already together. Such separation, if ever affected at all, must be effected by colonization The enterprise is a difficult one, but 'where there is a will there is a way:' and what colonization needs now is a hearty will. Will springs from the two elements of moral and self-interest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and at the same time, favorable to, or at least not against our interest, to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task may be.\\" Add this to yet another of his writings - \\"I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races -- that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race\\" and one must wonder about the man's true motivations. Lincoln favored sending the freed slaves to Liberia and out of the United States altogether. <br /> <br />Still, one cannot deny Lincoln's wisdom in delegation, appointing former rivals to positions of power, and his planned policy of reconciliation towards the south in the event of a northern victory. Perhaps one of the greatest tragedies to the defeated south was the murder of one who was their greatest friend as well as their greatest enemy.

0452285186|5.0|You have to be a certain type of person to find enjoyment in the sometimes gruesome death of fuzzy bunnies.  If you are, then this book is for you.  Some cartoons are just plain old belly laughs, some make you go ewww, but they all display a \\"different\\" side of creativity.  I did like this book enough that I bought the sequel as well.

B0002KPIQY|5.0|The story of 1980's supermodel Gia Carangi at first seems like dozens of other plots-the kid from the streets rises to fame and fortune, triumphs above all, rules the world, dabbles in drugs and life in the fast lane, and succumbs to the evils of drugs.  This movie, however, is MADE by the acting of Angelina Jolie, who portrays the supermodel Gia.  The movie opens with Jolie/Gia as a motorcycle punk in a working-class Philadephia family, and (seriously) the viewer wonders how she could ever be a model, with her punk-rock haircut and attitude.  A beautiful transformation occurs as Gia starts to rule the NY modeling world.  She is more magnificent than anyone else, that is, until drug ravage her body, her face, her composure, and her performance on shoots.<br /><br />The movie centers on Gia's relationship with a female makeup artist.  The two have a very brief affair, after which Gia obsesses over her lover until she manages to steal her away from her boyfriend.  Their relationship is on and off again throughout Gia's rise, fall, comeback, and life in rehabilitation.<br /><br />The world today is a different place than it was in the mid 1980's.  Gia was diagnosed with \\"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,\\" but she's never heard of that before.  In fact, she is the first woman her doctor has diagnosed with AIDS (she was an IV drug user, but he didn't realize the significance of that at the time).  When Gia is diagnosed, all she can ask is how she can get rid of it???, which will surely break the modern viewers' heart.  In her last days, Gia is visited by orderlies in full spaceman gear, so that they avoid her disease.
0399226907|5.0|My little guy and I read stories almost every night before bed.  He loves this story the best. He even calls himself the hungry caterpillar when it's time to eat.  He animates the story for me while I read, and then he (pretend) reads the story to me.  I so enjoy it. It is a classic. The repetition of the continuing journey of the hungry caterpillar gives my son the confidence to \\"read\\" to me the entire book, with great accuracy.  I also highly recommend \\"Little Quack\\" by Lauren Thompson for this very same reason. Also another favorite of my son's.

0316236535|5.0|I've had to buy several copies of this book over the years.  It is one of the most used books on the shelf.  I have a daycare in my home and I have found that kids of ALL ages love this book.  It's simple enough for the youngest child, but fun enough for the older ones.  The colors on every page are vibrant, but not distracting.  The kids have had me read this book often.  They love anticipating what piece of the monster is coming (or going) next.  And because of the way the pictures are set up, they can help me read the book and help me with colors as we go along.  A fun book all the way around.

It is about a normal boy who lives with his grandma and brother Kip. Napoleon soon befriends Pedro, a new kid with a moustache and a sweet bike. He also befriends Deb, a girl who does photography to raise money for college. When Napoleon's grandma is injured in an ATV accident, Napoleon and Kip are taken care of their selfish Uncle Rico,who causes havoc in Napoleon's life. Pedro decides to run for student body president, and Napoleon will do anything to get him elected.  <br /> <br />Okay, this movie may not be funny to everyone, like Roger Ebert, but I really enjoyed it. The commentary on the dvd is good, and the deleted scenes are worth a watch too. <br />Have Fun!

B00003CXAT|4.0|Steven Speilberg's Jurassic Park, is a classic example of the power of movie's to use special effects to generate money - real movie magic.  And the special effects are dazzlingly realist, the dinosaurs are alive and superb, and the action sequences are tense.  The story, by M. Crichton, was well thought out and impressive.  The plot is a good one mixed with many horror-movie type scenes as well as Speilberg's off the cuff sense of humor.  The only shortcomings of the film were the screenplay by Crichton and the un-satisfying ending by Speilberg.  The screenplay lacked many of the important issues brought up in the book such as the dinosaur's escape from the island and the international effect of the prehistoric creatures on the world.  And Speilberg's ending was too unrealistic.  No one spoke of the dinosaurs running wild or of the island's fate.  They just said, `park's closed.'  Both of the shortcomings in script and end leave the viewer wondering what for - it was such an interesting idea.  Will the dinosaurs migrate as they did in the book?  Will the island be destroyed?  I guess Steve Speilberg liked his new dinosaur buddies so much that he's decided to leave it wide open for a Jurassic Park II, only this time it will be called Lost Cash - the money that we missed the last time...<br /><br />Tige Lewis Quintina
0553260111|2.0|I really enjoyed the movies and got them on DVD, after having read the Sigma Protocol by Robert Ludlum I was a little excited to read the book thinking it would be more exciting then the movie.  <br />I was wrong, it is slow going, with long periods of in-action, the story reads well and while you feel for Bourne aka Delta, aka Cain, aka Webb... The movie pulls it off much better, by giving you a story that while it is not as complicated, still tells a good story with a meaningful plot. What got me the most was the Totally Anti-Climactic End, that leaves the story Un-finished, I threw the book on the floor after I read the last few pages.  <br /> <br />Avoid the book unless you have several hours to kill, the DVD tells a much better story.

B00004Y5A8|4.0|This is yet another interesting byproduct of the recent rush to re-release Brit groups and stars who performed during rock's glory age for various BBC TV and radio programs.  Usually these are a mixed bag, as they often collect different time periods, different settings, different styles, and different sound dynamics, all wrapped onto one or two discs.  Notable recent BBC collections include an early collection by the Beatles, a generally enthusiastic release from the Kinks, a great Led Zeppellin cd, and a very strong late-period Procol Harum set.<br /><br />This one is no different.  Like those I mentioned, the first cd of Bowie at the Beeb collects several early live performances of a red-hot Bowie fresh off the high of \\"Space Oddity\\" performing an eclectic set of solo, small group acoustic, and rock performances.  Leaving aside the annoying BBC host who is always omnipresent in these sets, Bowie turns in a strong yet tentative collection of his early songs, some joined by Mick Ronson toward the end of the disc.  Standouts include \\"Janine,\\" \\"The Width of a Circle,\\" and a rave-up performance of \\"It Ain't Easy.\\"  Those familiar with the early Bowie sound will find it in abundance on the first cd, an obvious talent looking for the right sound and fit for his muse, trying on and abandoning different styles but always a solid performer throughout.<br /><br />The second cd finds a far more confident Bowie a few years later (1972) in a studio setting, bringing his amped-up Ziggy Stardust persona and ripping through a blistering set of highlights from that period.  The sound (recorded with overdubs in the studio) is especially fine, and the performances first-rate -- Mick Ronson leaves no prisoners as he slashes through \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\"  Bowie even brings on a large contingent of supporters later on to help him with a superb set that includes \\"Starman,\\" \\"Space Oddity,\\" and \\"Changes.\\"<br /><br />Bowie fans will rejoice.  I hope the Bowie archivists start releasing more of his early and mid-period live sets, as we have seen with other similar artists, so we can fill in the missing pieces in the evolution of a singular rock icon.e of his early and mid-period live sets, as we have seen with other similar artists, so we can fill in the missing pieces in the evolution of a singular rock icon.

0740748475|5.0|I started reading Calvin and Hobbes to my daughter when she was 4 and she just loved it! I had thought that some of the things Calvin says might be hard for her to understand but I was amazed at her comprehension and understanding of the subtle messages in his jokes. Most of all she loves Calvin's attitude and we have spent many, many evenings with the T.V. turned off reading and imitating Calvin's mannerisms and doubling over with laughter...those are some of the best after dinner moments I've had with her! Now she is 7 and as soon as we heard that the complete set was coming out she wanted it! So did I as I love Calvin and Hobbes too. When we saw the complete 3 volume set at the discount club we were amazed that it was so heavy - and I could hardly get it off the top shelf where it was kept. So we decided to give it a miss thinking we could never be able to read them comfortably anyway...but each time we went back to shop at the store I would go down the aisle \\"by chance\\" and look at it. Finally, one such walk down that aisle, my daughter said - \\"Mom, Buy it! You want it as much as I do! Please don't wait till next Christmas!\\" I reasoned that at just 60% of the suggested retail price at the discount store it was a bargain, and finally bought it. Though it's a bit hard to carry, we can sit at a table or upright in the bed and enjoy the volumes. The pages and the printing is just fabulous. What a pleasure to have ALL of Calvin and Hobbes together in one place!<br /><br />Now I am looking forward to so many more moments of laughter and joy reading these comics with my daughter. It does look sturdy enough to pass down to her when she grows up!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's become rare and saddening in this day and age that truly great music remains buried under a heap of \\"progressive\\" neo-folk propaganda that is self-indulgent and tiring.  However, sometimes there comes a shining moment when an honestly fantastic album is given the recognition it deserves.   <br /> \\"Illinoise\\" is that album.  With its strange mixture of brilliantly orchestrated music and starkly beautiful lyrics, there can be no argument that this record deserves its place on the high seat of 2005's best. <br /> This is the second compilation that Sufjan Stevens has created on his mission to write an album for each and every state of the Union.  It follows in the footsteps of 2003's \\"Say Yes to Michigan!\\" (another wonderfully crafted work), but has managed to even surpass its predecessor. <br /> The first thing that caught my eye about this CD was when I read the song titles on the back of the case.  Could it be, an artist who actually has a sense of humor about him?  Case in point:  track number sixteen is titled, \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!\\" <br /> It has been a long time since I could find absolutely nothing to complain about on an album.  \\"Illinoise\\" is the godsend that finally enabled me to shut my mouth.  This is a historical narrative in every sense of the word; not just because it mines lyrical gold about the state of Illinois itself, but delves into the past of Stevens and the people featured in a breathtaking, almost unnerving way. <br /> Now comes my favorite part:  talking about the songs.  It hardly seems fair to pick some of these individuals over the others since each possess a value that is necessary to the success of the CD.  But there are a few superstars that cannot go without extra praise. <br /> The first of these is the third track, whose title I will condense to \\"Come on Feel the Illinoise!\\"  The first part of the song provides an amusing look at the Columbian Exposition of 1893.The second half has the ghost of Carl Sandburg offering up pieces of advice that are presented in an uncontrived way that only Sufjan Stevens could pull off.   <br /> There are two songs on this CD that seem remarkably similar to me, though this has less to do with any actual likeness in content than the fact that it is impossible to listen to either of them without feeling the chilling power of Sufjan's songwriting.   <br />The first, \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.,\\" provides a eerie, sorrowful look at the infamous serial killer and an introverted glimpse at one's own true self:  And in my best behavior, I am really just like him. Look beneath the floorboards...for the secrets I have hid.   <br /> The second, \\"Casimir Pulaski Day,\\" is just as evocative and haunting, but in a different manner.  It is a song that looks at loss, God, and death in a plain, clich-free manner.  I can't describe this song further than to urge you, readers, to listen to it. <br /> The last song that I have to heap exaltation on is my own personal favorite, \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!!\\"  The first two verses of the song are soft, acoustic descriptions of Steven's childhood.  But halfway through, the chorus (and I mean a real choir, not a repeated part of a song) breaks in with epic-sounding lines that jarred me where I stood when I first heard them.  The end is possibly my favorite verse, ever, from any song.   I'd write the whole thing but my editor would probably get mad at me. <br /> All in all, \\"Illinoise\\" absolutely deserved any and every bit of acclaim that it has received-and will continue receiving.  The lyrics and music in this CD are age-old and pose questions that are worth thinking about even as years go by. <br />\\"Even in his heart the Devil has to know the water level <br />Are you writing from the heart? Are you writing from the heart?\\"

0307276902|2.0|I began reading this book with high expectations, but after 20 years in law enforcment and seventeen more as a PI, I couldn't believe that editors and those that vet nonfiction in publishing houses believed most of what Frey wrote. I got half-way through the book before the Smoking Gun website \\"outed\\" the author, but picked out glaring inaccuracies that should have been spotted by someone. For example, when a lawyer is discussing with James having to do three years in prison after his release from rehab, James considers fleeing and becoming a fugitive. The lawyer says that if he can remain free seven years that the \\"statute of limitations\\" will kick in and he won't have to do the time. Any rookie cop, and certainly every law student that took an entry level class, knows that the clock stops running after an arrest has been made or an indictment handed down. James was already in the system so the statute doesn't apply. Other obvious lies jump out at the reader. The involvment of the FBI in a petty criminal's life is glaring. Federal agents handle federal crimes, not drug dealing by a street level junkie. There's more, but why go on? <br /> <br />Where was the vetting on this book? I've published three nonfiction books that were torn apart by the publishers making certain they were sue proof. And what of Oprah's producers and fact checkers? It costs maybe twenty bucks to run a criminal record check. Frey spent hours in the can, not years, and someone on Oprah's team should have picked up on this. Something tells me heads are going to roll. <br /> <br />Shame on everyone involved in this fiasco. If the book was touted as a novel, it was passable, but as a nonfiction work it's blatantly corrupt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|FIrst of all, if you have never seen any of the Miyazaki movies, do so IMDIATELY! He is a master of story telling and will sweep you away with grandeur and splendor beyond belief!!! <br />   NOw to my actual review... <br />   Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is the timeless story of a young princess desperate to save her peaceful valley from the warring kingdoms of man and nature in an apocolyptic future world.   <br />   This is certainly a gorgeous, gorgeous film worth watching in any sense. Miyazaki has a beautiful gife for storytelling and will keep you entranced with his epic storytelling and unforgettable characters.  <br />   Headed by reknown stars such as Patrick STuart, Uma Thurman, and even Alison Lohman, the vocal performances are strong and the script well plotted. <br />   THough My personnal favorite still remains \\"Castle in the Sky\\", I found this film highly engaging and thought provoking. In this movie I could see hints of future characters such as SHeeta and San (from Princess Mononoke). <br />   Some may argue that Nausicaa is a little too perfect, however, I find her perfectly relatable, unlike the sterotypical characters of modern films. THough I am not exactly into animals, I found her care for the forests and their inhabitants touching as well as her pleas to end the violence. In todays world and society I find this a highly encouraging message and this is certainly an excellent film for even some younger viewers (six or seven and older). <br />   If you enjoy this film, please be sure to look into this artist's other works such as PRincess MOnonoke, SPirited Away, Howl's moving castle, and my favorite, Castle in the Sky!
1400031087|2.0|I'm actually relieved to see the challenge to the reported events in this book.  I'm also glad I didn't pay full price for it!  While I'm not in recovery from an addiction, my own life experience and familiarity and work with people who are -- or aren't yet -- led me to check this book's non-fiction classification more than once.  And to notice that I kept questioning the 'realities' of this account as I read certain scenes.  While Mr. Frey may be 'sober' -- as in 'abstinent' -- the overblown and simply untrue nature of some key points in his narrative suggests that it's time for him to stop writing, interviewing, etc.  Time to review the Tao Te Ching again & take inventory. <br />   <br />The writing of a memoir suggests that the life it chronicles may be notable.  In this work, Mr. Frey appears to be trying to convince himself, and the world, that his life is notable.  The ordinariness of his addictions, and his resulting chaotic life and lousy behavior, are apparently not special or larger-than-life enough to sustain his belief in the need for or importance of his recovery.  A pattern of trying to fool oneself and 'the people' is not uncommon when addiction has control of someone's life.  While Mr. Frey may have put down the booze and drugs, another significant \\"weakness\\" still remains, and seems deeply-rooted.  He may scorn the 12-step approach in his \\"memoir,\\" but his own method of attaining and holding onto abstinence has not led to full sobriety yet.  He may want to believe the claim of \\"transparency\\" in his writing, but is still intoxicated with his view of himself, and ready to fight to defend the illusory aspects of his self-presentation. <br /> <br />The unfortunate part of this whole tangled mess is that, had he in fact published this as a novel, it would have been acceptable.  The first time I looked at it (and set it back down), I thought it WAS a novel.  If he sees himself in some way as larger-than-life, with an immensely worse history than the \\"ordinary\\" functioning addict, I guess he has finally achieved a truly ultimate, public self-flaying that this book alone could never have achieved.  People finally seem to have an opportunity to know who he is, and the effects of his ongoing, addictive internal self-narrative.  Time for him, and all of us, to once more contemplate the Tao...

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Jennifer Connelly (House of Sand and Fog, Dark City) plays Dahlia, a mother who is moving her daughter Ceci into an apartment building on Roosevelt Island and she is also in a custody battle with her husband, played by Dougary Scott (Mission:Impossible 2, Engima) who wants Ceci to stay in the New Jersey area. Connelly and her daughter get a tour of the place by Mr. Murray, a conniving and convincing John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights, The Aviator). Connelly enroles her daughter into a school two blocks away from the place and everything seems to be ok but things start to happen when water starts to drip from the upstairs apartment into hers. There seems to be a backstory to that apartment and Connelly's daughter picks up an imaginary friend along the way which could lead to some answers. What you'd expect from the Author of The Ring...another story involving a paranoid woman and a creepy kid seeing things but Connelly's performance anchors the movie along with the help of the supporting cast including Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) as her Lawyer and Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects, The Constant Gardener). Also starring Camryn Manheim (The Practice, The 10th Kingdom) and Mums. Surely better then The Ring 2 and The Skeleton Key combined.

0307276902|1.0|I have been hoodwinked.  I am insulted, I am disgusted, and I am angry.  Life is tough for family members of addicts.  They are lied to so often and so convincingly that they often eventually reach a state bordering on insanity, doubting their judgment on what is real and what is fiction in all aspects of life.  This self-doubt is reinforced at every turn:  politicians lie, CEOs lie, pharmaceutical companies lie, priests lie, journalists lie.<br /><br />Then along comes an alcoholic, a drug addict, a criminal.  He tells the truth (or so we let ourselves believe)!  The truth!  What a concept!  And he gets better!  Maybe our addicts (who haven't been as low or as bad as Frey) will tell the truth too one day.  Maybe they will get better and tell their stories and help others and all the garbage will be gone and their teeth will be pretty again and, most importantly of all, when they say something, maybe we can believe it.  That's what your phony 'memoir' did for some pretty desperate people, Frey.  Hoodwinked again by just another lying junkie.<br /><br />  No matter the noisy little mouths or the busy little fingers of the spin doctors; no matter the exalted rationales of the liars themselves--the real reason for all the lies by all the liars is always the same: manipulating others to serve themselves.<br /><br />  If you want to read this book just to see what the brouhaha is about, please borrow it and donate the price of the book to your nearest half-way house.
0893860220|3.0|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is not important, it is I that AM.  It appears that I can sense myself suspended in the thoughts upon the pages of this work.  Suspended and held captive by poor translation and editing.  The translation of clear thought starts off bad on the cover and continues through out the book.  For example from the cover; \\"The real does not die, the unreal never lived.\\"  The statement is incomplete and it leaves the reader with the impression that \\"The real\\" lives.  I don't live or die, I AM and that is all.  Can I be described as \\"The Real\\"?  Real compared to what?  What is there other than me?<br /><br />Again, from the cover; \\"Once you know that death happens to the<br /><br />body and not to you, you just watch your body falling off like a discarded garment.\\"  What the Self aware knows is that there is<br /><br />no body, no physical World, only the illusion of.

B000002U82|5.0|I have always been a stickler for great satire (the likes of Kurt Vonnegut), which is exactly what this album is.  I got into Pink Floyd because I am a big fan of Alan Parsons, who worked on this album. <br /> <br />The album is a great satire because it all ties together throughout the CD.  Listening to this CD is just like reading one of the best of Vonnegut's books, except it has the plus of being acoustically pleasant.  The CD attacks the very foundations on which society has built itself, money (Money), laziness (Time, though Time touches other ideas as well), and war/prejudice (Us and Them). <br /> <br />Several of the individual tracks aren't worth much outside of the context of the album (first two tracks, Great Gig..., Any Colour..., Eclipse), though the other four are excellent songs (all five stars on their own, about eight in the context of the album, stars out of five). <br /> <br />Brain Damage is the song that introduced me to Pink Floyd, and is still my favorite song of theirs, though several others on this album are closing the gap. <br /> <br />This album is the best deep, non-glaring satire around in music form (see Tom Lehrer for hilarious, obviously satirical music).  The album needs to be listened to several times before it can be fully appreciated for being more than just excellent music, but that is generally true of most great music (in my experience). <br /> <br />This is the defining album of musical satire, a masterpiece that takes the Sunny Side of Life we like to believe exists, and blocking out its glare so that we can see the world as it really is.  Quite possibly the best album there is.  As is said at the end of Eclipse, \\"there is no dark side of the moon, really.  Matter of fact, it's all dark.\\"
B0000AQS6R|2.0|This is one of the strangest comedies I have ever wasted my time on. Chevy Chase is a great comedian when he's given the chance. This script by John Hughes was either manipulated by a dozen or so movie execs or he just lost it. What's missing you might ask? Let's start with continuity. We're just limping along from one supposedly funny situation to another. But unless you never saw comedy before, you've all seen it - there's nothing really new that 'Christmas Holiday' puts on the table - not even the (according to the cover) \\"exploding turkey\\" (it actually implodes, but who thought that viewers might not notice the difference?). Second, they actually waste footage by repeating jokes. Yes, they extend the \\"turning on the xmas lights\\" situation twice. Give me a break! <br /> <br />The main problem is that the viewer is expected to have watched the previous National Lampoon movies with Chevy and his gang so as to be familiar with all the inside jokes. Guess what, I haven't, and that's (partially) why this movie falls so hard and so flat on its face as a comedy. Is it then a drama perhaps? A little supposed kidnapping, a SWAT team on the front yard, a feisty squirrel being chased by a dog through the house (probably the only funny scene in the whole movie - though it's been done before, so again nothing new here). You be the judge if you really have nothing better to do on that lazy Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br />There are a few tender moments, such as when Chevy talks about christmas to his young niece in the kitchen. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Look for something like \\"Elf\\" instead, a thousand times better than this.
B000002VCZ|5.0|No matter what any review will say, this is yet another strong Parsons' album.  It followed Ammonia Avenue, which gives Vulture Culture extra points for being way better than its predecessor.  The album opens with Let's Talk About Me, perhaps the best song on the album.  It focuses on people's obsessions with themselves to the exclusion of others. <br /> <br />Following the opener is the worst song on the album, Seperate Lives, which is probably also the song that fits the overriding concept of the album the least.  Still, it isn't bad, just not great.  Days are Numbers is next, and while it is a very good ballad, it doesn't cut it compared to many earlier Parsons' ballads (or later [limelight], for that matter). <br /> <br />Sooner or Later is the next weakest song on the album, but it is still an enjoyable song.  Vulture Culture fits the concept the best, but the type of music is not particularly my favorite.  Still, it is yet another strong track on this album.  Hawkeye, the only instrumental, is not, as some reviewers may claim, Parsons' best instrumental (Lucifer and I Robot take #s 1 and 2), as it is too repetive, but it still adds to the album as a whole. <br /> <br />Following Hawkeye is the only song that competes with Let's Talk About Me. Somebody Out There is a marvelous song about identity theft (listen to the chorus) that is excellent musically and lyrically.  Finally, the album ends with The Same Old Sun, another ballad that falls about where I put Days are Numbers, good, but not up to usual standards. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is very strong, with each track being worth listening to.  The collective value of the album is, as with all true concept albums, greater than the sum of the parts.  This CD is well worth owning.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Absolutely fabulous, so much so that our 3 granddaughters, 12 years and twin 6 year olds sat quietly through the whole first disc and begged for more.
0195067142|5.0|Sledge was a young, sensitive man who joined the Marine Corp and saw some of the most viscious fighting in WWII. I have read many memoirs of war. This one stands alone as the best. Mr Sledge has the ability to make you feel his pain and terror and show how his experienc transformed him. If you want to see and feel what it was like to serve in the Pacific with the Marines read this book. I've given it to over 7 people as gifts (something I have never done before) and all found it very moving.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I will be very honest with you this Depeche Mode CD just ROCKS!!! <br />is that simple go and get your copy today you wont regret. <br />these guys are finally BACK.  <br />This album will be a big hit for DM fans, I cant wait to see them  <br />on the road. WELCOME BACK!!!
B000BW7QWW|1.0|i can't understand this show was only on for not even on for 1-season & they make a movie hell it didn't even win any awards.babylon 5 was on 5-seasons plus but they wouldn't make a movie.it would have done way better in the theatres than this crap.babylon 5 would have done well in the theatre but no the suits have to try to change things the way they want.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|This movie was boring....All this word of mouth of how scarey and gorey it is is coming from poeple who don't have a clue what a horror film is supposed to be..The movie is just total hype 'cuase of it's director... <br /> <br />Plot is as simple as the acting=Three Schmucks go to Amsterdam in search of easy ways to get sex from easy Eurpoean woman and go the whore houses that are legal out there..At a hotel, They rommate with two girls who get poeple kidnapped for a place where poeple (like the amsterdam whorehouses) pay to torture and kill poeple...One of the 3 guys escape (the least liked of the 3 guys) and, well, that's pretty much the film.It was a disappointing 90 minutes..there was more nudity and sex scenes than was anything horrific (Except for the fact these 3 dummies got to hook up..)..There is nothing super gory about this film, and if you are a horror buff that likes films such as the Final Destination, Devil's Rejects,THe Freddy, Chucky and Scream movies, save your fundage and wait to see Final Destination 3 coming to theaters in Feb. 2006... <br /> <br />
B000003NA3|5.0|There is, in truth, too much hyperbole among jazz writers, and it reaches an almost unbearable crescendo when it comes to JC. (For starters, compare the notes to classical recordings on this site with the jazz writer's.)<br /><br />That said, this four disc set contains some of the best jazz ever recorded (not just \\"live\\" jazz, any jazz) and a few of the pieces are some of the most interesting music I've ever heard.(For comparison, think of Arnold Schoenberg's string quartets unbound, given free reign.)<br /><br />It catches Coltrane at the mid-point of his solo career--well afer the smooth \\"Blue Trane\\" and well before the \\"free jazz\\" of Acension--and, falling just behind ALS, he's at his best.<br /><br />A few of these pieces are ragged and unfocussed, but the majority are beautifully done and wildly enjoyable. (One caveat: I've never understood the attraction of listeners to \\"Greensleeves\\" which, unlike \\"My Favorite Things\\", should never have seen the light of day and here sounds like elevator music--both takes.)<br /><br />I can't think of one reason not to buy this collection. It's brilliant, wonderful, exuberant, and 45 years after being recorded it has stood the test of time. Its faults are minor compared to its overall achievment. Highly recommended.
B000002MP2|5.0|by far the best punk and Rock album of last decade. They have had the most amazing career. They have had nine albums and this is their third one.

B000BW7QWW|2.0|The show worked best on the small screen: the movie is awful.  If your a purist of the Firefly series, you will be more than a little annoyed at some of the plot changes that make much of the Firefly series irrelevant. By way of example, the pursuing \\"two by two with hands of blue\\" (if you remember the song River sings in the series) are replaced by a single self-effacing samauri (the \\"psy\\" angle that numerous episodes developed is abandoned completely in the movie). <br /> <br />In terms of characters, all of the Firefly actors and characters return, but some just hang about in the film with nothing really to do and looking, at times, a bit useless.   <br /> <br />The ending is very predictable and what you end of doing is just sitting around waiting for the inevitable deus ex machina and wondering why it took so long - but of course the answer is obvious why it took so long. <br /> <br />One of the things that really annoys me about this film is the fact that the \\"universe\\" looks like a rip off of the Star Wars universe:  the evil Alliance looks and feels a lot like the Empire in Star wars and Mel is really a minor clone of Hans Solo. He even dresses and acts like Solo, always saying tough things but in the end doing what is \\"right.\\" The banter about their ship, \\"Serenity,\\" is also a familiar banter made most famous in Star Wars. <br /> <br />Finally, as with a lot of tv sci fi programs, the creators seem to have lost their way with the opportunity to make a \\"film.\\" Time and time again you see successful tv series episodes that deal with simple plots that develop characters (this was especially successful with the best Next Generations episodes)and then you see the show move to the big screen and, inevitablly, the plot has to involve \\"big\\" issues: saving the universe, saving humanity from an evil policital force, uncovering and then telling the Truth to the masses, blah blah blah. You get all of that here and it makes the show have a very superficial quality to it.  It's just a fact that people who work on the small screen have a very hard time moving their concepts to the big screen and this movie is a prime example of that problem. <br />
B00000IQW3|4.0|Could you imagine a movie like this getting made today?  The concept of an arcade machine being used as a tool by aliens to recruit the best star fighters in the galaxy is probably the most hilarious thing I've heard of.  This is why this movie rocks! <br /> <br />Sure, the space battle sfx are pretty bad, but I think that adds to the appeal of the movie.  The over-the-top acting/script also helps with the cheesiness too. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good sci fi movie, you should probably steer away from this movie.  But if you're looking for something to laugh at, and have a good time, this is the movie to see.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My wife and I love musicals, and over the years have collected those we especially enjoy just for the viewing at our leisure. This CD is one my wife wanted for Christmas and Amazon.Com had it at a reasonable price. Many of these old movies are in moratorium, perhaps never to be reproduced again, and have become collectors items. We appreciate Amazon.Com's making it available to us.
0671027573|4.0|Jaine Bright is a thirty-year-old working in the payroll department at Hammerstead Technology. Every Friday, she and three close friends meet for dinner. During one of those get-togethers, their discussion veers into the elusive perfect man. Before they knew it, their ideas of what make up Mr Perfect are put into writing and (voila!) they have created a list of Mr Perfect. It was a great night and a great discussion but they never expected that their little fun could cause so much harm. For when they return to work, the list has spread around the company, then was made public until the press has named them \\"The Ladies of The List\\". To make it worse, their list has enraged a psycho and when one of them is murdered, Jaine turns to her neighbor for help - a no nonsense cop who both infuriates her and makes her heart throb.<br /><br />Sam Donovan is in the police task force who shares a mutual irritation with his new neighbor. But after getting over their initial animosity, the two will find themselves thrown together in a whirlwind romance that will end up with Sam playing the ultimate detective when Jaine and her friends' lives are threatened.<br /><br />Wow! From the first moment Jaine opens her mouth, I knew I was going to enjoy her character. I liked her outspokenness and cleverness, and absolutely enjoyed the way she finally puts Sam into his place that both shocks and impresses him. And as for Sam, well he kind of reminds me of Jack from OPEN SEASON - just as gruff and cocky, and just as sexy! I absolutely enjoyed the interaction between these two. The dialogues are witty and the love scenes steamy. The author has done well in balancing the suspense and romance and humor by not letting one aspect overshadow the other.<br /><br />Featuring such witty and fun characters, MR PERFECT is guaranteed to keep you glued from the very first page.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I first saw Michael Buble on tv for his PBS special.  I couldn't get the smile off my face and was practically mesmerized during the entire show.  That night, I ordered a couple of his CDs online and haven't stopped listening to him since.   <br /> <br />The DVD is excellent, although nothing compares to being at a great live performance (someday I'll see him live!!!).  Michael is a true entertainer, but his best quality is his voice.  His singing is absolutely superb- focused, ALWAYS in tune, very musical and expressive, and he has a huge vocal range which he handles wonderfully.  He listens well to his band and works with them (rather than the band only ever following him), which is evident by watching the DVD.  A recording studio can make anyone sound decent; Michael does it the first time and on stage! <br /> <br />My ONLY complaint is I wish the string players were better.  Yes, it's easy to see they hired a bunch of cute girls to balance the cute guys in the band, but couldn't they have found cute girls who played better in tune?  Some of the more exposed string parts sound pretty bad. <br /> <br />I recommend this purchase to anyone who likes music.  My three-year old daughter loves the DVD.  My mom loves Michael.  My husband, who has played in the best orchestras in the US and in many recording studios thinks Michael is terrific.  My brother, who loves Pearl Jam (for example), likes him.  Basically, I don't see how anyone could not like Michael.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I can't believe these guys act like they have something important to say nearly fifteen years after they made it big with the sophomoric one-note fart joke that was Dookie. Why'd Green Day wait so long to release a \\"political\\" album? Because it was convenient. And safe. It's now popular opinion that George W. Bush and his cronies are corrupt bastards. If Green Day were sincerely against a war with Iraq and cared about the world of politics, then they would have come out with this album (or at least voiced their supposed anti-war stance) before the Iraq invasion, when the decision of whether to go into Iraq was being hotly debated in Washington. These debates, discussions, and press conferences from politicians, senators, and even the president himself were all highly televised, but I guess Billie Joe wasn't smart enough to change the channel from Nickelodeon to CSPAN or the evening news back in 2002 when the Iraq war was about to happen. These guys are so uneducated and unaware of the world around them that it's pathetic. Billie Joe can't even creatively express his newly found dissonance. With lines like \\"Bombs away is your punishment/ Pulverize the Eiffel towers/ Bang bang goes the broken glass man\\" so stupid and nonsensical, you'd think they were written by a middle school dropout, which Billie actually is. And even at that, most middle schoolers know there's only one freakin' Eiffel tower, so I wonder what Billie's excuse is. Bottom line: Green Day plays the same 3 power chords seen on other Green Day albums, only with \\"political\\" lyrics that manage to be even more braindead than their ones about toking up and masturbating.
1577311523|5.0|The most powerful book I have read in the last 30 years.  Everyone needs to read this book if they want to understand how to live life in a state of peace and joy.
B00004RFFI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, not for the story, which is a little on the weak side.  But it's still enjoyable, with good special effects.  If you want a fun, light action movie, you might want to try this dvd.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I, like many others who have posted, am a huge Madonna fan and buy everything she puts out, on the day it comes out and can usually find no fault with the material. I usually disagree with all the critics and wonder \\"what were they thinking when they criticized this album or that album, they obviously were not listening to the same album I was\\". And, again this was true with Confessions. That is why this review is so long after the release date. <br /> <br />I had read all the pre-release reviews, which were the most positive reviews I had seen for a Madonna album, I got excited. As the days to release dwindled, I got more and more anxious. I was excited to see what new twist she was gonna throw in, what new buttons she would push, what new messages she would have to impart. and then the day came, and I rushed out and bought the album and put it in and..........and......next track....and....next track.....and....and so forth. End of the CD comes and I just sit there, numb. No messages, nothing we haven't heard before, nothing shocking. Disappointment set in. Then I went online to see if it was just me that felt this way and people who also called themselves \\"HUGE FANS\\" were bashing away. So, I pulled the CD out, put it on the shelf, and figured I would just have to wait for the next album. <br /> <br />Fast forward to Dec when the special edition came out. I decided to order it just so my collection was complete. It arrived and since I had nothing else in the car, I popped it in. What a difference some fresh ears brought. <br /> <br />I knew \\"Hung Up\\" and feel it was the perfect choice for the first single. But I was surprised at how much I enjoyed every other track on the album. Are there \\"deep, meaning laden\\" lyrics? Not so much. But, lyric's with a message are what she has been criticized for on the past 4 or 5 albums. Either they have been too far out and convoluted or too political. None of those here....But they will stick with you regardless. Is there forwardthinking, new, experimental music and beats? Not so much. Again, many people have complained she did too much of that on the past few albums. She even got flack for actually learning to play and using a guitar! Well, you won;t get any of that here. Actually, it sounds very retro. And if you have read about the sampling of her own and others music, don't expect to recognize it. Most isn't blatant, and even as a fan, I had to listen a few times to get some of them. One note: On Push, which is about the support her hubby Guy Ritchie gives her, she does use a kind of sample in lyrics of a Sting song. Well, for anyone that doesn't know, Sting and his wife introduced her to Guy, so it makes sense.  <br /> <br />I now find myself listening to the entire album over and over and enjoying it every time. I had hoped for something different, but she basically gave everyone that has been complaining for the past 10 years exactly what they asked for. A CD that is just light, fluffy, harmless, non-threatening dance music. And by trying to not push anyones buttons, she has ended up pushing just as many as before. But this time it seems to be her fans that are irritaed, while the critics love it. <br /> <br />I find the album very enjoyable (except the \\"dork\\" line in \\" I love New York\\", even that bugs me...grrrrrrrr) and can be easily listened to over and over, after you get over the shock of not being shocked. Is it her best? Definately not. But, it is light, danceable fun and I think that is what she was going for. And if you listen closely, you just may find there are some messages buried in there none the less. It is definately better than alot of stuff out there posing as music today and at least I can dance while I wait for the next Brilliant album to come from Lady M. <br /> <br />
0064400018|5.0|Little House in the Big Woods was my favorite of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books when I was growing up.  Now I'm reading it to my son, who's almost 9.  Before we started it, I was a little worried that he would think it was a \\"girls' book\\" and therefore not interesting, but he loves it!  He just couldn't get over the idea that 5-year old Laura had never seen a town or even 2 houses near each other.  His favorite parts were Pa's stories about fighting a tree stump and *his* Grandpa's experiences with a panther and, in his childhood, with unexpectedly sledding at high speed with a large pig!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Mayer is a supremo player but seems to have been futzing around for the last few years trying to find his voice - I thought \\"Heavier Things\\" was a drag, too much existential angst and fairly incomprehensible. (All singers should take diction lessons from James McMurtry!) This album, however, rocks. In the words of Mr. Hooker, seems like Mayer is here playing for the peoples and not himself. While obviously a admirer of SRV, Mayer manages to pass on Stevie's energy without stealing his licks; what's weird is his singing voice at times sounds uncanily like SRV - which is good as one can actually understand what he's saying on this CD. Criticism by some here that Mayer is some sort of faux blues player is, I think, uncalled for - this guy can really rip. Luther Allison was criticized by some as a \\"sell out\\" as he also liked to play other stuff than straight ahead blues. So what? I was relieved to find out that on track 11 (\\"Try\\") that in the eighth bar Mayer had not grown a third hand - liner notes say Palladino played guitar in this intro. (Phew!) Mayer is a huge guitar talent and seems to have put it together in an approachable album here. Jordan's drumming and Palladino's bass playing superb. Sound quality decent for a live session, but I'd say the final track is a bit murky.
B00000IREA|1.0|A while back, I saw Ed Wood's \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" and came away thinking how justified the claim of \\"Worst Movie Ever Made\\" was. Everything about that film was bad, and it single handedly redefined how wrong things could go when trying to tell an effective story. However, my opinion of it changed after seeing \\"Barbarella.\\" Make no mistake; \\"Plan 9\\" is still awful. However, I eventually came to see that, for all its shortcomings, it at least managed to stay true to what it set out to accomplish: to give a social statement in the guise of a science fiction story. Had the makers of \\"Barbarella\\" even attempted to do this, it might have been an enjoyable and campy romp.     Unfortunately, this was not the case. In my humble opinion, \\"Barbarella\\" ranks right up there with \\"Plan 9,\\" and not in the way you might be thinking; at least the latter was so bad that it was good. \\"Barbarella\\" was just plain bad, from the very first frame to the last.    This erotic science fiction/fantasy-based on the stories of Jean-Claude Forest-is one of Jane Fonda's earliest film roles. Maybe she wanted to get this film out of her system before tackling more serious, or at the very least, less ridiculous projects. I would certainly be embarrassed if I were in her place, especially since she has gone on to become a highly respected actress (with a couple of Academy Awards to show for it). In all likelihood, she was cast only because she was at that time married to the director, Roger Vadim. I suppose everyone has to start somewhere (but at least it should be somewhere worthwhile).    The plot is simple, if even relevant. In the incredibly distant future, Barbarella, the \\"Queen of the Galaxy,\\" is recruited to track down the brilliant earth scientist, Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea), and recover a secret weapon of his design. During her quest, she crash-lands on a planet ruled by the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg), a dominatrix type woman who constantly refers to Barbarella as \\"Pretty, Pretty.\\" Barbarella also meets Pygar, a blind angel played by John Phillip Law (who was obviously picked for his looks rather than his talent). From there, it goes from one silly, half naked escapade to the next, culminating in an ending so excruciatingly ill conceived, it's not even funny.    The overall look of the film made me want to punch the production designer square in the face. Absolutely everything was tacky and cheap. The worst looking shots were those of outer space, if they can even be described that way at all. Instead of the common representation (an inky backdrop dotted with twinkling stars), we are shown a formless mass of viscous goo photographically combined with sparklers and various lighting effects. It's not genuine space; it's a universe trapped in a container of hair gel. And let's not forget the interior of Barbarella's ship, which was covered from floor to ceiling with dingy shag carpeting.    Describing the characters would require a lengthy reach and a boatload of speculation. This is because there is absolutely no character development; everyone in this film slides through as heartlessly as a ride vehicle passing through a room in a funhouse. Indeed, a funhouse is exactly what the film feels like (albeit, it's a heavily drug induced funhouse).     The best one has to work with are the characters' physical appearances, which amounts to nothing more than sexy eye candy. Case in point: Barbarella. There is no question that Jane Fonda had the body for this part, and the filmmakers certainly wasted no time in somehow showing it off. The very first scene is of her stripping out of a spacesuit while floating in zero gravity. While certain risqu glimpses make their way through, most of her body is covered with the jumbled letters of the opening credits. The rest of the film has her shifting from one skimpy costume to the next, being that she somehow keeps conveniently losing them. One of them was bitten away by demonic dolls with a taste for human flesh (at which point I couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Disneyland's \\"it's a small world\\"). Another was sucked out through a pipe as she's being \\"pleasured to death\\" by an orgasm-inducing keyboard instrument. I may have lost count, but I think that by the end of the film, Barbarella had gone through seven costume changes, a trait reminiscent of Queen Amedala in \\"Star Wars: Episode I.\\" Did any of it matter? Not really. It was only done to show off Jane Fonda's body: never mind adding something meaningful to the plot.          One of my biggest beefs with this film is its poster. It's annoyingly deceptive in terms of the film's genre. Seeing it automatically leads one to believe that the film is a classic science fiction adventure. True enough, we are shown distant planets, spaceships, and various weapons utilizing technologies that exist only in the imagination. However, it looks and feels too different; the continuous appearance of swirling psychedelic backdrops and exposed female anatomy makes it seem more like a sexually charged acid trip than a science fiction story. It was like going into the mind of Hunter S. Thompson and getting ringside seats for his private fantasy. Trust me when I say that that very quickly loses its appeal.     At this point, let me return to \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" for just a moment. Is it a good film? Not by any stretch of the imagination. But is it at least mind-numbingly entertaining? Certainly. It's failure to succeed in every way made it fun. But \\"Barbarella\\" was no fun at all. It's nothing but a gigantic mess, from its style to its performances to its blatantly inappropriate music. I really can't help but feel that this is a film even Ed Wood would have laughed at.
B00006D295|5.0|This movie never gets old.
B00005O3VC|5.0|classic monty python..needs no words from me
B000AARKOO|2.0|This movie wasnt terrible, but I can't recommend it.  I fell asleep during half of it because it never caught my interest.  The efforts of the filmmaker seemed to be more asthetic then creating anything dynamic enough to hold your attention for a couple of hours.  It's a shame...the Crusades would have been a great storyline for a movie, but this is more like a boring fantasy.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Federico Fellini's deeply personal account of a film director (himself, played by Marcello Mastroianni) who at the start of a new picture finds himself dried up. In a wonderful blend of reality, flashback, and pure fantasy (the last two sometimes indistinguishable) we explore the director's dilemma: actors and actresses are waiting for auditions; the producer hounds him; his writer (actually his alter ego) keeps telling him the script is empty and pointless, the project a waste of time (this ironic character, played by Jean Rougeul, is a marvelous creation). Also there is his wife (Anouk Aimee), who no longer can stand his philandering.<br /><br />The flashbacks/fantasies are very funny, especially the one in which he imagines all the women in his life make up a willing harem. The only fault with the movie is the last five minutes where Mastroianni concludes he can't procrastinate any longer, and that making pictures is his life and he must get on with it regardless of the failures: it's all much too preachy and cheap. Actually, the movie should have ended in the car with Rougeul lecturing him on the uselessness of his work: that would've been perfect. Anyway, the movie is packed with great ideas and beautifully filmed images. Definitely worth a watch.
B000002UAX|5.0|These guys just amaze me, every album they made was spectacular. And this one was no exception. This is like a collection of what each one of these band members can do solo. George continues to grow as an artist and a songwriter with the haunting While my Guitar Gently Weeps. John performs the edgy Happiness is a Warm Gun to perfection. Paul also has his classics such as Helter Skelter and Black Bird. I would recomend this album to anyone who truley appreciates great songwriting or is just a Beatles fan
6305313687|5.0|First of all Edward Norton delivers an absolutely incredible performance along with all the supporting actors. This is trully one of the best films I have ever seen. This film depicts how young, confused teens(or people of any age for that matter) of any race can be sucked into racism. The film also does a good job of showing how racism is narrow minded and just not worth it.  <br /> <br />I highly recomend buying this film and showing it to anyone who is willing to watch it and able to understand it. I bought this film without seeing beforehand and I love it and i'm thrilled with my decision to buy it.
B000002UAU|5.0|When you think of the Beatles you think of this album. And there is a reason why, because it is excellent in all phases. Maybe the best collection of songs the group had on one album. I could play this one from start to finish and not change one song. Paul starts it off right with the incredible Sgt. Peppers song. Ringo gives  a nice performance in With a little Help from My Friends. Also maybe one of the most notorious Beatles songs Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. The album ends with A Day in The Life which is worth the purchase of the entire cd for that one song. This is the Beatles at their finest.
0071410945|5.0|The process Young outlines is the clearest, most direct approach to producing big ideas.  Young was a creative director at one of the most creative agencies, Doyle Dane Bernbach, during their most creative period (ie. Volkswagen Beetle, Polaroid and American Tourister.) <br /> <br />I bought a copy for everyone on my staff!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Althought I made it a point to watch Firefly based on the limited promo it got, I never got around to it (my pre-Tivo days).  Being a fan of science fiction films I went and saw Serenity at the movie house, which was wonderful.  Started going back and catching what reruns I could of the original series, with limited sucess, and found it a quirky but engrossing show.  The DVD collection is a nice compilation of the entire series, with enough special features to warrant its purchase over recording it yourself.  The series does a good job taking a western show into outer space, although in a much less subtle way than Gene R. did in Star Trek.  A well written show with intriguing characters--a must for any science fiction fan.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|The longest in production, the lowest grossing and most limbo-bound Star Trek movie of all. Nemesis is neither here nor there. It entertains without satisfying and features loads of brilliant SFX, but little awe. Perhaps we are all just too familiar with franchise and it needs to forever be increasingly far-reaching to keep it fresh.<br /><br />However, it IS a lot better than Insurrection. In terms of direction anyway. Jonothan Frake's TV movie approach to the franchise lacked any sort of class or sophistication but Stuart Baird fixes that with a darker and more menacing tone. The script is more sinister than that of Insurrection or First Contact (the Next Gen movie titles still remain uninspired) but what ends up in the film is confused and undefined.<br /><br />The plot has Picard sent out to Romulous to help make peace with the new Preator, a man who calls himself Shinzon and who happens to be an exact clone of Picard. Data finds an android identical to himself buried in the sand of a nearby desert planet. Picard and Data are suspicious of their radical finds and the suspicion soon proves to be justified as treachery and double-crosses are revealed.<br /><br />With an unconfirmed amount of deleted scenes (rumors put it around the 50 minute mark) it's painfully obvious that important plot developments have been cut out of the film. The sense of the Enterprise emptying as all the main characters leave for new career paths is lost. Worf and Crusher are hardly featured for some reason. The relationship between Data and his long-lost brother B-4 seems very thin. The sub-text is muddled and hard to get to grips with. And a sub-plot involving Praetor Shinzon's lust (and subsequent repeated rape) for Deanna Troi is abandoned as soon as it starts. What was the point of starting it in the first place? Is B-4 actually Data's evil brother Lore?<br /><br />And despite the fact that Star Trek has been around for almost 40 years at this point, the STILL do the cheap 'desert outside of LA as some other planet' trick.

For all the talk of him looking slightly different from Picard due to his life of hardship, he didn't look very hard.<br /><br />Also, Jerry Goldsmith's score just seems like loads of his previous scores with some cues altered slightly.

B00005UT85|5.0|This was Caravan's first album, recorded and released in 1968, and to this reviewer's mind and ears, it was one of the first real progressive rock albums along with Soft Machine's debut, released that same year.  You've really got to hand it to the Canterbury proggers--they balanced seriousness and facetiousness extraordinarily well in their music; just listen to any album by Gong, Soft Machine, Caravan, Hatfield and the North, Egg, etc., and you'll never again think of prog as \\"grim-faced philosopher\\" music.  (In fact, most prog bands, with the possibly exception of King Crimson--due to R. Fripp's overbearing studiousness--have a dry, subtle sense of humour that the uninitiated will miss on the first trip, but most others will pick up on easily, and laugh out loud at the underlying goofiness.)  After all, how else could you approach a song with a title like \\"Where But for Caravan Would I?\\"  And of course, \\"Love Song With Flute\\" sounds like a starving artist's first painting (think \\"Lawn Chair With Fruit\\" and you're in the ballpark).<br /><br />Yet for all that underlying levity, this is a seriously good album throughout.  The sonic differences between the mono and stereo versions are obvious--mono is a bit flatter and two-dimensional, whereas stereo has actual depth--but this is a minor complaint...not even really a complaint, just an observation.  The addition of the single version of \\"Hello, Hello\\" is nice, as this reissue was put together somewhat after the reissue of the band's sophomore release, If I Could Do it All Over Again I'd Do It All Over You (1970), on which \\"Hello, Hello\\" first appeared as an album track.  The liner notes give a nice account from Pye Hastings of the band's beginnings and their struggles to find a label (Island's Chris Blackwell hated Pye's singing voice and declined to sign them on that basis), especially after the UK branch of Verve/Forecast folded within a year of its establishment; luckily, Decca, who were distributing Verve in England, picked them up and they were able to continue forward.<br /><br />Favourite tracks on here include \\"A Place of My Own,\\" \\"Cecil Rons\\" (with its gonzo chorus) and \\"Where But for Caravan Would I?\\"  Pick this one up; I did, and haven't regretted it for a moment.

B000BVD460|5.0|Simply one of the greatest albums of 2005.<br /><br />It contains some of the most important pop songs of the last five or six years. Eminem is truly a great artist, on the same level as Michael Jackson for the eighties or Elton John for the seventies.<br /><br />He helped to redefine pop music and brought us into the 21st century with such hits as WITHOUT ME, STAN or CLEANIN' OUT MY CLOSET.<br /><br />It's maybe the most important greatest hits package of this new century so far and it's a shame that it's Eminem's farewell cause I'm sure he had so much else to give. He's going to be a producer now it seems but he could have moved on with his own music and brought us some new hits. Some others will sing them for him through his productions but it's a shame he's not going to get all the credit for it.<br /><br />Eminem, thank you for everything you brought to pop music and you can be sure this CD will become the reference for your work. I don't know who will be the next greatest pop culture icon but it's going to be hard to follow.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|Okay, so this is a score composed by a non-Japanese man. Forget that. This score is beautiful. John Williams certainly delivered. Different than his rousing Star Wars and Superman themes, the music here is very serene. Not only does it compliment the scenes beautifully, but it's also good music in its own right that you'll want to listen to again and again. Trust me on this. Buy this album.
0307276902|3.0|Frey has done the reading world a diservice by selling a \\"non-fiction\\" book that includes a lot of fiction.  There is no doubt that \\"Million Little Pieces\\" is a fascinating read following the life of an angry, confused, and addicted young man.  Still, readers need to be warned that parts of this book consist of fictional writing. Even in the opening chapter you will likely wonder as I did what U.S. airline would have allowed Frey on a flight in the condition he claimed to be in (was this opening chapter all fiction?).  We must demand and expect TRUTH in non-fiction books.  Frey and his publisher do not deserve any more of our hard-earned money.  If you must read Million Little Pieces read it knowing that some parts are completely \\"non-fiction\\" and borrow it from a friend or from the library.
0679745203|5.0|There was a time, not too long ago, when you could sit in a cafe and hear the words The English Patient within the half hour, either that or see someone with their head ducked into the pages of the book between slurps of coffee.  Of course this popularity made me wary of the book and the movie and I formed ready stereotypes and turned my attention elsewhere.  Then the paperback copies of the book started to come out with the actors faces on it, and I have vowed never to by a book that brandishes its connection to the movie version of the story - call me a grumpy old man, but it seems that the book was the book before it was the movie and I'd much rather form my own visual and dramatic accompaniment to the text without seeing the face of some actor.  (Disclaimer:  I might love the movie if I actually saw it, but that's not the point!) <br />And yet, poetic justice prevails.  On a slow winter morning at my coffee shop, I looked warily over at a copy of The English Patient that someone had left on the shelf months ago.  In fact, I didn't even think that I was picking up \\"The English Patient\\", and instead looked to the merits of the book's fine author Michael Ondaatje.   I thought of Anil's Ghost, which I enjoyed, and Coming through Slaughter, and thought it might do me good to start off my day with a glance at the inspired prose of a great writer.  Later, I would read about Hana reading to the English patient:  \\"When she begins a book she enters through stilted doorwas into large courtyards.  Parma and Paris and India spread their carpets.\\"  In the first paragraph of this book, we enter into The Villa, following Hana into the room where the English patient lies.  \\"She turns into the room which is another garden - this one made up of trees and bowers painted over its walls and ceiling.  The man lies on the bed, his body exposed to the breeze, and he turns his head slowly towards her as she enters...\\"  We are introduced to a relationship, and through the relationship, toa place, and through the place, to a war, and through the war, to the strange lurches of a civilization in a time of great change and to individuals trying to situate themselves amidst the absurdly ordered chaos of it all.  Once you fall under the spell of the story, you are left to dream, and to be changed forever by the experience.

B00005KB9X|5.0|Though I love \\"Burnin\\" and \\"Catch A Fire\\" just as much   as this one, this album was my introduction to Marley   and holds a special place in my heart!   It was 1981 and I was stationed at Ft. Lewis, Wa.   right outside Seattle. I had two of the hippest roomates   that I could've had!   We all were heavily into music and exchanged ideas,   albums, genres with each other and I expanded   rapidly on my musical expertise!   I was also turned on to \\"gunga\\" and guinness stout (yuck!)  by a \\"spliff-smoking\\" kat (B.D.) who was out of Brooklyn, NY   via Jamaica who used to play this funky but offbeat   to my ear at that time kind of music called reggae!--  Boy, I liked it!  Bob Marley was my favorite of these that he played   and a new love affair with another great artist was born!   Buy any Bob Marley and The Wailers album from 1972's  \\"Catch A Fire\\" to 1980's \\"Uprising\\" and you can't miss!  R.I.P. Bob Marley!!

B000002VCT|5.0|This review can't really be considered objective because I am a huge fan of the man's work.  He is the consummate musician, contractor, producer, composer, engineer - I mean, what can't the man do?  He's worked with The Beatles, and there's a select few that can say that.<br /><br />As for Pyramid, it could be loosely considered a concept album, but not nearly as much as Tales of Mystery & Imagination.  It's just another brilliant, slightly different, offering from a brilliant, slightly different, artist.  For some reason, this album has been hard to find for a long time, so when I saw it on Amazon for a reasonable price, I snapped it up.  Probably should have bought ten of them, as I recommend you do.  This is every bit as good an introduction to the man's work as anything else, though there isn't a commercial 'hit' on it, proving once again what little commercial success has to do with art.<br /><br />Buy this - you won't regret it!
0380789019|5.0|It must be among his very best, anyway. One of those rare books that after finishing, you want to flip back to the first page and start again! It is a bizarre combination of Alice in Wonderland, BBC's Dr. Who, The Anubis Gates, and Thomas Pynchon's V (though really it is nothing like any of those...) I will try to write a review that does not give away any of the many surprises it contains, though the book depends as much on character, atmosphere, and insight as it does on trickery and surprises--though it has those elements in abundance, as well!<br /><br />The main character, Richard Mayhew, is remarkable in how utterly unremarkable and unheroic he is. He is sort of Frodo but without the courage. An unusual and effective choice by the author, I think. The main villains, as earlier reviewers remarked, seem like basically a rehash of the assassins from 'Diamonds are Forever,' with a dash of Hannibal Lector--overly familiar, perhaps, but terrifying for all that. I was especially struck by two things about the book, I think. The portrait of this hellish and yet exciting and rich alternate world beneath London was remarkably seductive. And yet this romantic effect is created with almost aggressively unromantic details--the characters are frankly gross and pathetic, for the most part! Quite an accomplishment by the author, to make them so seductive and relateable, regardless. And, this may be a minor spoiler, the utter rejection of any kind of a romantic happy ending was very unusual and striking, and quite appropriate and satisfying, coming as it did at the conclusion of this uniquely alienating and yet life-affirming underground fantasy.
0446577383|4.0|I just finished reading this book and i am glad i took the time to read this one.  I have never read a Baldacci book and heard about this one on a local radio station, DC101.  This book was a very fun read.<br /><br />The book started out a bit too fast for me, by fast i am refering to the amount of characters introduced. There were many players introduced, very quickly that left me confused at times trying to remember who was who.  However once i got that out of the way, we were off to the races.<br /><br />The entire book leads up to the ending, as most books do, however because of this, the book tends to be slow paced at times.  The premisis of this book is a group of random people who witness a murder....this group is also involved in uncovering government conspiracies, needless to say they have fallen right into one.<br /><br />The main character is a guy named Oliver Stone....i dont want to ruin the book but i will say that after reading this book i would personally love to see Baldacci write a book based on the life of this guy.  He sounds like the type of character that one could write a series on!<br /><br />Like i said before, this was a fun, exciting book to read with a very fast developing ending.  This book will have you flipping pages to see what happens next which is definitly something that i love in a good book.  Easily a best seller!<br /><br />Great work David!

B000E1YVZU|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This movie itself is really good in its own.  It is very moving and the soundtrack is incredible!  It just doesn't have the same impact as the theatre production.  The story seemed watered down.   <br /> <br />I've seen the play 4 times and the movie twice so far.  One note is that the movie has a better soundtrack than the play's.  The production quality is amazing!  If you can get your paws on the 2-disc limited edition CD, I highly recommend it.  It's too bad that not all the songs from it are used in the film (that may be why it wasn't as impactful).  I hope those missing songs are in the deleted scenes at least.   <br /> <br />It's great that 6 of the original 8 castmembers from the first Broadway production are in the film.  They did a great job.  And the newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms brought a lot to the film.   <br /> <br />A Historical First for Hollywood: One thing that was really fun for the die-hard RENT-heads (like me) was that the film's website had an interactive BLOG for the fans to communicate with the actors and filmmakers during the making of the film.  <br /> <br />All-in-all; fans of the play should still buy this so they can have their own little piece of RENT at home.

0446525537|5.0|A Walk to Remember is definitely the perfect story describing how love hurts when you least expect it to. The main character of Nicholas Spark's bestseller, Landon Carter, told a story while he remembered a year in his past and described how it changed his life forever. Landon told the story of how he fell in love with a girl he hardly knew two years back, Jamie Sullivan. His main issue with this was that he had recently promised not to fall in love, but that was when the idea struck him as bizarre.  <br /> <br /> Landon went through many emotions throughout the book: love, happiness, and misery. He first joined drama as an \\"easy\\" class to finish out his senior class in high school, and he performed a play with Jamie. During the time they were together, he learned all about her. He soon found out many disapproved of the two eventually dating due to the fact Jamie was too good of a person. A truly sad ending after Landon finally found out the reasoning of the sentence that came back to haunt him: ` \\"You have to promise that you won't fall in love with me.\\" ' This realistic fiction book's main theme was to listen to your heart, and it will lead you to true happiness. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Spark's book is written in a flashback while Landon told his story. A Walk to Remember reminded me of The Notebook (also written by Nicholas Sparks) because it captured me the same way. Once I started the book, I wanted to keep reading until it was finished. The ending was terribly sad, but I did not break down completely like I think Nicholas Sparks expected readers to. This was because while I read, I remembered that horrid sentence. A single series book, Nicholas Sparks has and continues to write emotion capturing and life changing tales.  <br />

1400031087|1.0|Several things didn't ring true when I read the book and yet I was willing to believe that it had some basis in reality given all the buzz...yes I'm a naive idiot! Come on, a root canal without any anesthetic?  He earned a college degree despite being a hardcore addict who blacked out every day? The redeeming hooker with a heart of gold? As a work of fiction, this book is mediocre to say the least.  Check out Hubert Selby for truly harrowing and haunting depictions of addiction.     Additionally, I am disturbed by the book's bravado that really only serves to mythologize Frey rather than adding to serious discourse on the reality of addiction.  That several of the central plot points are untrue significantly diminishes any redemptive quality the book and its defenders claim.  Frey makes himself out to be some miracle boy, immune to the nonsense of \\"Twelve Steps\\" and other therapeutic devices, who can enter a bar the second he leaves rehab to prove that he has conquered his addiction for good.  Frey has created a superhero (who leaps over crackheads in a single bound!), arguably to the detriment of other struggling addicts who will never measure up. Perhaps it is lucky he has been exposed as a fraud.

0393035158|4.0|\\"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?\\" I Cor. 14:8. <br /> <br />As if coached by the apostle Paul, Sam Harris sounds his call to battle with a ringing panache. If over the coming century religious fanatics take out a few major cities, or destroy civilization altogether, we can't say he didn't warn us. His bold thesis here is that the threat does not come only from fanatics. Just as terrorists thrive only when they are sustained by a critical mass of sympahtizers who are not themselves actively violent, so fanatics thrive only because they are nourished by the swamp of religious moderates. It is there that every pestilent superstition and every archaic barbarism is coddled in its larval form, and Harris is here to tell us that the time has come to drain the swamp. <br /> <br />The publishing world has given us a plethora of books cheerfully marketed as \\"guaranteed to offend everyone\\". In reality, they are being touted to demographics that pride themselves on not being PC, or not being easily offended, and such books are full of cynical wiseacring and formulaic humor. But here's a book that really does have something in it to offend nearly everyone -- (Are you a biblical literalist? You're equated to Al Qaeda. A moderate mainline believer? You're the real problem. A liberal? You have made an idol of toleration that will be the death of us all. A secularist? You ignore peoples' vital spiritual aspirations. A conservative? You make excuses for the barbarisms of war.) --  and it's refreshingly earnest. I found its sincerity endearing.  <br /> <br />The central idea is that, although religion has always given rise to horrors, the magnified powers of destruction that modern technology puts into the hands of individuals and small groups means that we can no longer treat \\"My God is better than your God\\" as a silly game that we can allow the children to go on playing. The hour has come to eliminate \\"faith\\" altogether, for the good of everyone. It is not enough to eliminate extreme versions of religion. Moderate versions must also go, because by their very presence, and adherence to the same fanciful notions, they lend an air of legitimacy to the extremists. <br /> <br />The case is presented with pith and rhetorical flourish. It is to Harris's credit that he is willing to tackle themes we are accustomed to tiptoeing around, and strictly as a manifesto, the book succeeds. Those aspects of religion which encourage barbarism, and there is no denying that they exist, and are in part encoded in the various creeds' core texts, do pose a real and growing danger. Unfortunately, the quality and clarity of Harris's argumentation is not up to the same standard as the quality of his preaching. <br /> <br />There are three main problems. First, Harris paints such a lopsidedly hostile portrait of Islam that it serves to undercut his valid point: that however impolite it may be to say so, there are real differences in the ease with which the various religions can be subverted to violent ends, and that of the major faiths, Islam offers its moderates the flimsiest ammunition in the battle against such subversion.  <br /> <br />Second, he is fatally fuzzy about the identity of the enemy. When he is sharpest, what he has in his sights is the foolish and dangerous notion that there is a special virtue in \\"faith\\", in the sense of believing certain propositions without evidence, which somehow becomes even more virtuous when you believe it in the teeth of the evidence. \\"Faith\\" in that sense must be named as an inexcusable vice. But he equivocates, and dissipates his aim, by making all religious belief, that is, belief in gods and miracles, his target. The most deadly 20th century instances of \\"faith\\" - fascism and Leninism - were not religous at all; and numerous religious moderates make no virtue out of ignoring evidence. <br /> <br />This second flaw is critical when you consider what exactly he is asking themoderate believers in his readership to do. <br />That moderates are mysteriously passive in confronting the evils of extremism within their ranks is an important observation. But if it is the presence of any religious beliefs whatsoever that constitute the enemy, rather than the refusal to adjust those beliefs to align with facts, then all Harris can be asking of the moderates is that they abandon their religion entirely. Perhaps that's what he expects them to do, but it's a utopian expectation. A more careful analysis might provide a feasible program for action, but what we get is a first class marching band without a street to march it down. <br /> <br />And therein lies the third flaw. The only solution Harris has to offer is itself utopian: replace religion as we know it with a rational, empirically based spiritual practice of meditation. Since meditation practices have been around for millenia, without generating sufficient appeal to satisfy the spiritual yearnings of the vast majority of people, he has to pin his hopes here on breakthroughs in neurology that will make mystical experience more reliably and readily accessible to all. Much as those advances may be possible, the daunting complexity of the brain suggests that we will probably have to wait more than a century for any such secular-spiritual dawn. It gives us no blueprint for dealing with the excesses of blind faith in the meantime. Harris himself realizes that this hope is a bit of a Hail Mary pass: he closes his first chapter with the admission, \\"what follows is written very much in the spirit of prayer.\\"  <br /> <br />These disappointments with Harris's answers do not negate the value and importance of the questions he raises. No matter who you are, you will disagree strongly with some of what he has to say. But you will be stimulated to think outside your usual box.

The WWII Germans are the bad guys, our flawed Hellboy is the hero, and he gets the hot female lead in the last scene. Yes, I said hot.<br /><br />The pace is good, the attitude is bad (that's good), and the effects are good. The visual presentation helps move the story along. For example, almost the entire first sequence is bluish monochrome with two colored exceptions: Our Hero is red, and the Evil Babe's lipstick is red. That tells you who to watch. OK, it's not subtle, but this is a comic. I'll look elsewhere for subtlety.<br /><br />(BTW, I've never read Hellboy comics. I probably won't start, even though I liked the movie. Lots of other comics are good, too, and my preferences lie in other directions.)<br /><br />Maybe you like comics. Maybe you like action movies based on over-the-top characters. Maybe you want a flick that's exciting enough, but where people stay mostly dressed and the gore is kept under control. If so, the movie has a fair bit to offer. Go ahead, enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird

Everything that should happen to him as a drug addict does from his lost love and criminal record pre rehab to the people he meets in rehab.<br /><br />That said I still recommened this book to people because I think the description of his inner demons is very true and powerful.  Frey manages to describe his compulsion to drink and use drugs, something he names the fury, in a manner that no one else has.  I came away from this book with a true sense of what drives an addict to drink and use drugs and when those subtances are not avaiable their desire to use other things to fill this void from food to gambling that I never had before.  In addition to his descripition of the fury I found the scenes with his parents and his brother very moving.  This is a true potrait of an addict taking a long hard look at himself and how far he had fallen and the relazation that he had the power to turn his life around.<br /><br />Now to the exagarations.  Although he may not have been as much of an outcast in high school as he claimed he may have felt like one.  As to the true extent of his criminal record I do belive he exagarted it, but I think it was to make a point. It makes the mantra he repeats to himself throughout the book about being an addict and a criminal more vivid.  If he said he felt like a criminal because he had a DWI record people would probably laugh it off because a lot of people have been stopped for DWI and do not feel like criminals.<br /><br />Everyone exgaterates to get their point across wether it is in their day to day life or in their writing.  As a few reviewers on this site have pointed out if Frey wrote about sitting in group therapy and smoking cigarettes all day the reader would have been asleep by page 4 no matter how good his descriptions of his inner demons were.  Some of Frey's exagarations may be over the top, but my biggest problem with them is they seem like cliches and that is why I give the book four stars.  However, these exgarations do not dim my desire to read his other works, My Friend Leonard and the novel he is working on.ge 4 no matter how good his descriptions of his inner demons were.

B00005LC3Y|5.0|This is by far the most accurate, and i do not mean entertaining, depiction of USMC Boot and the limited view of an event in VietNam. <br /> <br />Been there and done both. <br /> <br />The opening half of this film was very close to dead on the money.  Remove the murder, although at the time I think many of us would have, and add some more of the physical contact administered by the DI's and you have boot camp. Don't get me wrong  I graduated Boot at PI in 1962. Our Sr.Drill Instructor holds the all Marine record of 16 first place platoons and then he went to VietNam with us. The  training and his die hard efforts to mould us into men and brothers kept many of us alive and brought us home.  So I thank this film for showing that side of Marine life. <br /> <br />Now as far as Whistling the theme to the Micky Mouse club as they marched in Hue City, well for one thing we didn't enter the city marching in files. We were ducking a hole bunch of sh** that you wouldn't believe, so I guess I can over look it. <br /> <br />If this movie is reguarded as less then real, or as complete fiction, and takes a back seat to Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Brando it's only because the other pictures were highly promoted, had top names in them and WERE fiction.  <br /> <br />Full Metal Jacket brought back the memories of the making of a brotherhood and the \\"earning\\" of the title. It also brought back the bad dreams and fear of the night.  <br /> <br />An unknown vet wrote the following which i think sums up what this film is all about. <br /> <br />\\"Thoughts by a Young Veteran\\" <br /> <br />\\"The years others knew as youth, I spent learning the meaning of Death. <br /> <br />The times others spent learning to love, I passed hoping to live through endless nights. <br /> <br />The moments others remember as laughs in classrooms, I remember as terror in the jungle. <br /> <br />The instants of pleasure taken for granted by others, I remember as forgotten hopes,--long ago crushed by the realityof war. <br /> <br />The unfulfilled dreams of others are yet to be thought by me since I am searching for my elusive youth, looking for years lost in combat, which are no more---and will never be.\\" <br /> <br />Full Metal Jacket IS this reflection. Thank you for telling our story.   <br /> <br />Semper Fi

B00006CXSS|5.0|When I first sat down to watch this series several years ago, I was fully prepared to be barraged with another lousy interpretation of the Second World War, courtesy of Hollywood. It had been so long since I had seen a war movie that was historically accurate and truly deserving of the label \\"masterpiece.\\" In the years leading up to \\"Band of Brothers\\", I had been forced to sit through countless modern war movies that had me grimacing in my seat (\\"Pearl Harbor\\", anyone?), with only \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" somewhat impressing me. The older war movies were great (\\"The Longest Day\\", \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", etc...\\") but the lack of cinematic technology made it impossible to truly depict the horrifying experience of war. <br /> <br />But when I saw \\"Band of Brothers\\" -- WOW! I was blown out of my seat! Never before had I fully appreciated the sacrifice our brave soldiers made while fighting in WWII. The series pulls you into the mindset of a soldier, in which you can feel the raw fear and anxiety that accompanies harsh combat. I jumped at every gun shot, and yelped at every mortar round. <br /> <br />The acting throughout is superb. You can easily connect with many of the (real!) characters portrayed, and you cheer for them, cry for them, and mourn for them. But kudos must be given to Damian Lewis for his portrayal of Maj. Richard D. Winters, who is one of the most pivotal characters in the series. You'll easily learn to love the character. And if you don't know much about Mr. Lewis' background, you will be shocked to find that he's British, especially after carrying a perfectly convincing Pennsylvania Dutch accent in the series. <br /> <br />Not much more can be said about \\"Band of Brothers\\" that hasn't already been said, only that it is undoubtedly one of the best things to ever be put on film. It deserves far more than five stars. <br /> <br />Too bad the Oscars don't recognize miniseries. \\"Band of Brothers\\" would have swept it.

B000BPCCZA|4.0|well, it could have been better. with that said, all in all it was pretty good, even though, other than \\"Steal this Album!\\" which wasnt really an album because it was just a bunch of unreleased songs by the band, it was probably the worst album of the lot, but it wasnt bad. strange as that sounds, it's true, it's a good album, but it's the worst by the band, in my opinion. that's still saying that it's a really really good album though. the dvd side is alright, if you can hook up a stereo to the tv for better sound it's cool because it's like listening to the album with a picture with it. the \\"making of\\" is a bit strange though, it's not really about making it. it's just a bunch(actually only like 15 minutes) of footage of the band, but only about 3-5 minutes talking about the album.
B000CCD292|4.0|Constantine: <br />I enjoyed this movie, even though it seems overly 'witchy' to me: heaps of demons, demon-possessed people and references to the devil which I admit did have me feeling a little uncomfortable at times... but the special effects were excellent. <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves made a great chain-smoking Constantine, I think he played him well. I have always found Rachel Weisz incredibly annoying, she reminds me of a deer in the headlights. In this movie though, she gives a well rounded and credible performance as the woman who enlists Constantines help -her twin sister dies while in a mental institution and is written off as a suicide. Rachel's character refuses to believe this, since her sister was a 'good Catholic' and wouldn't take her own life because she knew she would go to hell if she did. <br /> <br />Constantine comes into her house, does this amazing thing where he goes to hell (via the eyes of a pet black cat?!) and finds out what really happened. Unfortunately this opens another whole can of worms (or demons as the case may be). There are some good subplots going on in there too. <br /> <br />I can't give it 5 stars because I felt the ending descended slightly into farce, normally this type of movie terrifies me but I found myself rolling my eyes, especially in the scene where Keanu lifts his finger to \\"Luc\\" (as in Lucifer), I found it incredibly implausible and glib. <br /> <br />But it was still a good way to spend a couple of hours. <br /> <br />Alexander: <br />This was OK to start but I confess I got bored very quickly.  Colin Farrell as a gay man was just too implausible, as was Angelina Jolie playing his mother!  Watch it if you must but don't expect too much
0307276902|1.0|I read this book a few months ago, and thought the writing was poor, but appreciated learning a lttlie bit about one man's experiences with addiction and recovery.  Now that I know it is fiction, I don't think there's any reason to read it.  The main character is an annoying, seof-aggrandizing liar.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|I was prepared for some self-righteous, simplistic, liberal preachiness (you get a full blast right away, with \\"war for oil\\" pontificating - are actors and directors just too busy to get themselves educated on reality? I'll wager that none of them is aware of the latest scoop - documents have recently been translated that prove Saddam was training terrorists), ...<br /><br />... but what I wasn't prepared for was how BORING it turned out to be - not to mention physically painful to watch, because of the purposely over-jerky camera.<br /><br />Apart from these issues, it is interesting to see our perception of Mrs. Quayle change, and if the premise is true, it exposes a truly horrific pharmaceutical practice. (Of course, it pales in comparison with an even bigger scandal - the prescribing of extremely toxic AIDS \\"drugs\\" to people who are probably only suffering from diseases of poverty - see rethinkingaids, aliveandwell, etc.)
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this movie.  I laughed so hard I cried.  Ellen Degeneres is hilarious provding the voice of Dory.  I was hysterical through the whole talking to the whales scene.  Brilliant for children and adults alike.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|My mom and I are addicted - we both agree, this is one of the best seasons, if not the best. Everyone seems to start realising what they want (even if they might be steered off later on!) and try to get it. It's so much fun to watch the characters progress, and this season is a perfect example of that - oh, I just adore it!
B00008EY9G|5.0|Yeah, as you can probably tell from all the five-star and one-star reviews here, IDENTITY is a mixed bag.  But it has three great things going for it.  Firstly, every character has his own mystery, and these mysteries all are solved in fresh, entertaining ways.  Secondly, the performances are all top-notch.  Thirdly and most important, this is the best role of  John Cusack's career, and this fact alone is worth whatever price you pay for this movie.  Let's face it.  Normally Cusack is relegated to sex comedies.  Here he plays a take-charge ex-cop, not only a character of justice but of morality, even in the face of extreme hardship.  Don't take my word for it.  See IDENTITY.
0393317552|4.0|The book had a good synthesis of the physical factors that shaped early history of mankind. It is incomplete because it doesn't factor in the effects of culture. It also has a blind spot that totally dismisses the effects of IQ - an approach that is politically correct but not correct in reality.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|I liked this as a child, and I had to own it, as it was part of my childhood memories of hanging out with my little brother, watching horror movies all night long and scaring each other senseless.  After I bought it and watched it again, I realized why as a kid I liked it, and why as an adult I thought it was pure crap.  The jokes are cheesy, the characters goofy and laughable, the music godawful.  Any kid would relish that.  But as a horror connoisseur and sadly a much older person, all I have to say is, bleeccchhh.  It's cute, I still get a giggle out of Brenda's brains being \\"rich and spicy\\", but that's about it.  Good to see once while you're home watching other gems such as Halloween 2 and Child's Play 3 on TBS.
0312323859|4.0|it took me a while to like this one for this time around the story was told in darcy's point of view.  considering darcy was not my favorite character in SOMETHING BORROWED, i wasn't initially thrilled to hear her viewpoint.  i missed hearing about the good guys, rachel and dex.  however, as the story went on, darcy began to redeem herself and become, believe it or not, a bit more likeable.  when i'd finished reading this one, i felt as if i was saying goodbye to an old friend.  i cannot wait for emily giffin's third book!
0143057375|5.0|I've listen/read all of E. Tolle's work.  I found this one to be one of the best.  Very informative.
0790732254|5.0|IMO this is one of the finest movies ever made.  All four of the actors delivery the performances of their careers.  The characters are developed, unique and like them or hate them every single one of them makes you FEEL. <br /> <br />By the end of the movie you will be exhausted, exhilerated, profoundly moved and possibly emotionally disturbed. <br /> <br />This is a true classic worth owning & watching every few years!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you were a fan of Buffy and Angel, and more than that, a Joss Whedon fan, you will love this series.  The first couple of episodes left me a little puzzled, but by the end of the series, I was thoroughly in love with all of the characters, the music, the storyline and everything to do with it.  I have since bought Serenity and the Firefly soundtrack.  For me, Joss Whedon's writing and views of a possible future world are fascinating and fun.  This series is fun, imaginative and sheer enjoyment.  And, if you are a music lover, the Firefly soundtrack is a must have.  The music is incredible and it hasn't been off my CD player since I purchased it.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|I have been on a kick trying to find some of the old movies I remember and loved during my childhood. Santa Claus was my favorite Christmas movie by far. I hope my children love it as much as I still do!
B00005QDW1|3.0|I have been a fan of No Doubt for over 10 years - This album, though not NEARLY close to thweir best - is great...if you like dancehall reggae and club music.  If you are an old school no doubt fan (Beacon street, self titled, etc...) it might take some getting used to.  Definately less depressing than Return of Saturn, not as punky as Tragic Kingdom, nothing close to Beacon Street or the self-titled album....<br /><br />It's good.  Plain and simple.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I've always loved Pride and Prejudice. More so, when I discovered the BBC version, most fondly known as the Colin Firth version. I have nothing but praised for that mini-series, and I have fallen in love with the story even more. I love how repressed and snooty Darcy is, how charmingly snarky Lizzie can be. There was also a sense of maturity in the mini-series, and most probably, it was influenced by the casting of older actors that resulted in that. It worked well for them. All in all, the numerous times that I have watched it in entirety is a testament to my love for it. And then I hear there's a new version coming out with Keira Knightley as Lizzie and some guy as Darcy. How dare they attempt to remake it, when possibly the definitive version has already been done?!     I have heard that many Austen purists are in uproar over this and I can see why. It's not your mother's Jane Austen, for one thing -- while some may think that's an insult, I mean it as a compliment. This new version is less polite, less genteel; it's also less repressed and more in-your-face, well, as in-your-face one can be in breeches and cravats. Whereas the BBC version used its 6 hours to meet and match and flirt and separate the characters, the movie has less of that luxury so it makes up for it by being more fiery and earthier, more emotional and even more confrontational. It's also very young,in the best sense of the word.  It's fresh and new, and I would have love to see this version fleshed out to its full width and breadth, rather than just the abbrieviated version that I watched. But even then, the experience is wonderfully involving.  Here, emotions are always on the verge of breaking through the surface, making the passions more heightened and the anguish more excuciating. And love is felt in all its giddy, painful, confusing glory. A lot has to be said for Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen taking on roles that have been done (and brilliantly before). Yet I actually like their new takes on the characters: Knightley's Lizzie is less polished but equally as witty and charming, while MacFadyen's Darcy is less self-possesed and more vulnerable but equally as snooty (and later adorably, meltingly romantic).    I love the touches that made this movie fresh:    1) The characters of Jane and Bingley are more defined, and that's something that is better than the mini-series. There, she comes out as bland while he seems almost retarded while here, Jane's more animated and self-possessed while Bingley is charmingly nervous, adorably shy and sweet-tempered.    2) During the dance, when they were arguing and suddenly, only the two of them are left dancing and sniping at each other -- this is a very imaginative take on the whole cliche of having eyes for only one person, even in the midst of a dance and in the middle of an argument.    3) The almost kiss after Lizzie rejected Darcy. The look on his face was so wonderful, seeing as we can view how much it was hurting him to turn away while she was surprised at her seeming to want him to kiss her. *sigh*  They are so attracted to one another depite hating each other's guts. Lovely...and soooo hot. (p.s. I so wanted to hug and kiss him for that little boy lost look when he realzied that she said no to him).    I thought I would never see anyone else fill Darcy's shoes but Colin Firth but in this version, Matthew MacFadyen acquits himself wonderfully and so deos Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett.
B000001FLI|4.0|The old 8-track of Roy Buchanan I listened to growing up has a whole new dimension on compact disc. <br /> <br />Roy's solos literally crackle through the speakers.  \\"John's Blues\\" is amazing.  \\"Pete's Blue\\" will make the fine hairs on your neck stand on end.  The chord progression he uses on \\"Pete's Blue\\" is downright amazing.  It's the best thing on the album. <br /> <br />Or maybe \\"Messiah\\" is the best thing.  It's perhaps his best known song.  It's an exhibition on how to play the Telecaster; how to squeeze every last decibel of sound out of wood and steel, which he proceeds to do near the end of the song as he dances all the way up the fretboard. <br /> <br />This album would have five stars if not for the largely uninspired vocal tracks.  Roy's guitar saves the day, though. <br /> <br />Even if you don't like the blues, you'll love this album.  It's Roy Buchanan 101.  And it's scary.  But a good scary.
B00005GL0N|1.0|What a shock.  The music is great but the CD is a Japanese Import and is in Mono.  There is no separation, and it is flat.  Do not, repeat do not, buy this CD.  Amazon has another Capitol label CD that I believe is Stereo.
1573223026|5.0|I almost put off reading this because I tend to prefer upbeat books and it sounded kind of depressing, being about 4 suicidal people and all. Fortunately some of the other customer reviews convinced me to try it and it has turned out to be one of my favorite books ever! I would urge everyone to listen to the book on CD. The narrator does a superb job of giving authentic and quite distinct voices/personalities to each of the 4 characters so that you always know who's talking. And somehow, amazingly, despite a serious philosophical meaning-of-life subtext, Hornby manages to make this an extremely entertaining and laugh out loud funny book. I literally laughed out loud (I listened to it in my car on my way to and from work) and I hardly ever laugh out loud. I highly recommend the audio version of this book.
B00003CX96|5.0|The qualities of this film are exactly what make me watch movies. It's the story of a small town Indiana nineteen year old that is at that stage in his life where school is finished, and the decisions are many. It takes place in small town America and makes you want to live in a simpler time (it IS from 1979).  <br />   What is so good about this film is the relateability that I think anyone can find in it.     <br />   There are friends, teenage desires, and misunderstanding parents. It's sad that there aren't more movies like this around these days. Movies that are simple, have a strong message, and are phenomenally put together are few nowadays; especially ones that make you wish you could live in that simpler time, as this one did with me. <br />   This is the kind of movie that draws you in so much that you find yourself watching the end of the credits and have to force yourself to get up off the couch. <br />   Go watch it, you won't regret it.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|The reviews here at Amazon.com never cease to astound me. Some knock me out with their sensitivity and intelligence, some make me laugh out loud with joy at their use of humor to express their feelings, some make me laugh out loud with disgust at their pretentious attempts to sound sophisticated while not being able to spell or use correct grammar...and some make me shake my head in disbelief at the level of hatred they generate in response to something they simply cannot understand, appreciate or begin to relate to. More often than not I've heard some reviewers pose the question: If you hate this recording so much, why are you going to the trouble of writing a review of it? Do you feel some twisted obligation to \\"strike a balance\\" in the presentation of reviews? Do you feel the need to make those who love the recording feel like self-conscious idiots? Or is it merely some alternate way of venting your anger over the fact that you're involuntarily without a significant other, living in your parents' basement, and earning a \\"paycheck\\" by flipping burgers at the local Mickey D's?<br /><br />After listening to Sigur Ros's previous 3 albums--and after being overjoyed by the uptempo, more optimistic feelings expressed in TAKK--I hold to the theory that they are not of this world. They are not OF the musical mainstream in any sense. Their music gives new meaning to the term \\"exotic.\\" In short, they are an ACQUIRED TASTE, like a fine bottle of wine. Imagine that for a moment, if you would. Someone hands you a bottle of wine that is priceless, one that collectors would consider killing for. You feel privileged to be holding such a treasure in your hand...you pour the wine into a crytal goblet, and take a drink...and sadly, it just doesn't do it for your palate. Now the question arises: Would you, because you weren't enamored with the wine, smash the bottle to the ground? Or would you instead act from a place of evolution and consideration for those around you, and simply put the cork back in the bottle, smile, and hand it to the person next to you for their consideration? Something to think about.<br /><br />Sigur Ros are not for everybody. Speaking for myself, I feel blessed to be familiar with their music. Since hearing \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" (which I STILL regard as the most beautiful song they've ever written), I have looked forward to each new release from them, and TAKK could very well turn out to be their Sergeant Pepper album. It is a masterpiece. But, as has been pointed out, they'll more than likely never end up in Billboard's Top 10. And, as has ALSO been pointed out, those of us who appreciate their unique, one-of-a-kind music from another planet could not care less about that. It is the singularity of this band's music that is the major source of its drawing power and keeps those of us who love them singing their praises. They are coming to do a concert in Kansas City on February 22nd, I have my ticket, and I feel like a kid who's been given a free pass to my favorite candy store. If only there were more artists like Sigur Ros in this world, musicians unfettered by the demands of the music industry, fashion & trendiness, who forge bravely ahead and express themselves freely & without reservation or self-consciousness...wow.<br /><br />Mysterious, ethereal, charming, mystical, other-worldly, trance-inducing, thought-provoking, full of imagery...Sigur Ros is all this and so much more.

0767847431|4.0|I just watched this with my kids, and they were spellbound.  There is no other word for it.  The official description gives you an idea of the plot, but nothing can express the magic of a young mind that aborbs this entertainment that is as good as greek mythology (there are many similarities).  I witnessed two young minds, awestruck and open, watching this and asking questions - some of which I couldn't answer, and so we must go elsewhere to find them together.  What better recommendation is there than that?<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|i watched this movie to kill time, thinking it was a shoot 'em up hollywood flick. instead, this is an original idea, disturbing, satirical, and very well done plot that sticks to you the day after you see it.  the trophy wife who happily mooches off her millionaire husband, and then pulls the morality gig is a classic.  where were her questions about her husband's (nicholas cage) line of work during the years when she spent his money?  the lame good for nothing brother who is hooked on cocaine, only to clean up, find a girlfriend, and get ready to buy a business...but, where to get the money?  oh yes, a little bit of gunrunning, as long as it is ethical, clean, and moral should do it, until he sees people hacked to death and ready to be slaughtered. then, the morality comes on, and manifests itself in a classic \\"i'll just blow it all up\\" outburst.  this one is a must see for all those folks jaded by the recent usual hollywood fare.

B000003CMB|5.0|If you had to rank live rock albums, this would easily be the best.  But what you really need to know about this album is that it captures the Allman Brothers at their peak with their complete lineup (Duane Allman and Berry Oakley present).  The guitar interplay between Duane Allman and Dicky Betts is brilliant, but it doesn't stop there because this was a band, a great band, with a complex rhythm section (two drummers), a soulful bluesy singer/organist, and everyone contributed with musicianship at the highest level, more comparable to a classic jazz band than anything else in rock n' roll.  This is really more than rock n' roll, it's blues-jazz-rock fusion, it's dazzling.  Once you hear it you'll never forget it.
B00008976Y|4.0|This is a brilliant film, about a woman whose life is shattered, first by untimely death and then but the discovery of betrayal.  This is te best film of the trilogy by far, with outstanding performances by Binoche and others.  This is a real woman, who suffers and learns to renew herself, through art and love.  I was deeply moved by this film, totally drawn in.
0740748475|5.0|My wife was kind enough to buy me this set as a holiday gift.  When she put the set in my lap to unwrap, the weight nearly killed me!  This set is the real deal.  It's heavy and sturdy and should last a hundred years.  The cartoons are beautiful and many are in full color.  Evey house should have this set (especially if you have kids).  This set is nice enough to hand down to future generations.

1400032717|4.0|I didn't buy this book when it first came out because it looked like too much of a quick read and I wanted more pages for my money.  However, I have finally gotten around to reading it and I'm very glad I did. <br /> <br />Whilst I don't really know anything about autism, it was interesting to read a novel based on a young autistic person's point of view. Christopher is trying to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbour's dog, however the story quickly changes about midway through and starts focusing on Christopher's relationship with his family.  There are a few surprises along the way and moments of humour as well (particularly in the footnotes). <br /> <br />The writing style is simple but very effective. Being only a relatively short novel, the story moves along quickly through necessity so there are no slow, drawn-out sections.  I finished this book in about 3 hours but it was time well spent and I look forward to reading more of this author's work as it's published.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|This is the best album Jamiroquai's ever put out... hands down.  \\"Dynamite\\" is long overdue.  It had been a long 4 years since the release of \\"A Funk Odyssey\\", which to hardcore fans was Jami's most disappointing release.  To me, it wasn't bad.  It was just experimental, so it wasn't as great as the 1st four albums were.  Looking back on this unique group, the first album of theirs that I bought was \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" a couple years after it came out.  I listened to that album non-stop.  It was amazing.  And then \\"Synkronized\\" (my former favorite after \\"Dynamite\\") came out a month later and I was ecstatic because I was getting even more from  this amazing group.  Again, awesome music.  I eventually went through their back catalogue and realized they put out 2 other great albums before that (I had seen \\"Space Cowboy\\" on MTV back in 1995 and turned it off real fast for some reason beyond me).  Then... \\"A Funk Odyssey\\" came out.  It was okay, but as a fan, you have to admit it was below Jay Kay's standards with its cold, Daft Punk feel.  So is \\"Dynamite\\" more of the same... or is it a step backwards into Jamiroquai's glory days?  Well, this album is not only a progression of the styles presented on \\"A Funk Odyssey\\", but it's also a conglomeration of the styles presented on all of their warmer, more organic albums.  Does it work?  Heck yeah, it does.<br /><br />What I personally like about this album is that I had fun identifying what each song reminds me of from their older catalouge.  For instance, \\"Dynamite\\" reminded me of \\"Little L\\", \\"Travelling Without Moving\\", and \\"Mr. Moon\\" all in one fell swoop.  The best thing about this album is that it covers so many styles like their breakthrough album \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" did.  And with that eclecticism, there's a song on the album for everybody (no complaining allowed).  You have disco, smooth R&B, jazz, rock, new wave, house, balladry, and even a touch of reggae/latin in one song.  And if there's anything Jamiroquai is known for, it's being all over the board by flirting with any type of genre.  With that said, moving on to what stands out on the album is... practically every song.  \\"Starchild\\" is THE BEST SONG JK HAS EVER WRITTEN.  That song alone gives this album 5 stars because of its melody and lyrical similarity to the political JK of old.  \\"Soul Education\\" used to be my favorite Jami song ever, but \\"Starchild\\" trumps any song they've ever composed prior to it.  Some people might think that's going too far, but it's not.  The song was so good that I literally teared up because it sounded like vintage Jamiroquai, only 10x better.  Other standouts include \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" (different sound for them), \\"Dynamite\\", \\"7 Days in Sunny June\\", and \\"World That He Wants\\" (although some may say that this doesn't have any place on the album, it's classic Jami).  Of course however... there's always a downside to an album, and one of them is the use of Daft Punkesque guitar riffs, which were overused on \\"AFO\\".  They get grating after a while.  If they sounded more like what was on \\"Starchild\\", they'd be more tolerable.  I also didn't care for the mindless disco of \\"Don't Give Hate A Chance\\".  I like the melody and heaviness of it, but not the vocal arrangement.  Another disco song, \\"Time Won't Wait\\", sounds like a reject from Incognito's last album.<br /><br />My BIGGEST gripe about the current incarnation of Jamiroquai is that the glue that held the group together, Toby Smith, has left the group.  Why? Who knows.  But I suppose that doesn't matter because new keyboardist Matt Johnson more than captures that quintessential sound that the band is known for, with his minor key melodies complementing JK's jazzy vocals.  And at least Derrick McKenzie and Sola are still hanging around.  All in all, this album is leaps and bounds beyond what a typical Jamiroquai album is.  And I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it a few days ago.  I don't really know what elseto say about this album except DON'T download it.  It's worth your money for sure.t this album except DON'T download it.  It's worth your money for sure.
014240165X|4.0|I'm a father who's son doesn't care too much to read, except for the Alex Rider adventures. He loves them. I hope other authors can come up with stories as well crafted as this one so my boy will read more. The story itself is intriguing, even I found it interesting to read. <br /> <br />One other book, a bit more advanced, that my boy likes is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This book is fun and exciting with no sex, profanity or graphic violence that younger readers shouldn't be exposed to yet. Check it out, it's pretty good and maybe could get your hard to read youngster interested.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This film is impressive on all levels. The camera work is incredible, and mixed with the musical score, it really brings the heat. The story is awesome, involving dragons, castles, soldiers and futuristic weapons. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a must see, for anyone who likes good entertainment.
0385512058|5.0|You may or many not like all of the tactics in this book, but there is one concept that you MUST get to make this work.  That is -- provide VALUE first.  Now this might seem like common sense, but, if it is common sense, then why isn't it more common.  I can say that 99% of the people that try to start business relationships with me start by asking what I can do for them.  Talk about starting off on the right foot.  Provide value to others.  If it comes back, great.  If not, take another piece of advice from this book -- don't keep score.
6305949980|5.0|A great movie to watch for kids as well as adults.
078681859X|3.0|The whole book kept me captivated, though revenge type stories don't as a rule attract me. I did like the interplay between the characters and some of the action sequences were thrilling. <br /> <br />A book I'd reccomend to teens and young adults who like action adventure with a touch of magic thrown in is Brian S. Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage. Exciting, thrilling, and doesn't have a lot of sex, profanity, or graphic violence.
B000001Y5J|5.0|When Nine Inch Nail's debut album \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (1989) was first released, it was greeted with little fanfare or commotion. Over time, however, through word-of-mouth, the album caught on.  In the early 90s it became an underground and college favorite. Through constant touring and the emergence of the popularity of alternative rock in the early 90s, Nine Inch Nails started to take off. While fans eagerly awaited Trent Reznor's proper follow-up, they eagerly devoured the stop-gap EP \\"Broken\\" (1992).<br /><br />While \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" went for straight-forward industrial beats, \\"Broken\\" is far heavier, more aggressive, with more guitars. While the club/techno crowd may have been more receptive to the debut, \\"Broken\\" is an EP that would just as likely appeal to metal fans. Equal parts metal and industrial beats, \\"Broken\\" can be seen as a prelude, or a sneak preview of what Reznor would unveil two years later with his masterpiece \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (1994).<br /><br />Clocking in slightly past the half-hour mark, with eight songs (two tracks are hidden, two are instrumentals) \\"Broken\\" is pretty short. But the EP is so angry, so aggressive, with no reprieve; the shortness in length probably works for the best.<br /><br />\\"Broken\\" features the NIN classics and concert staples, \\"Wish,\\" \\"Gave Up,\\" and (the hidden track) \\"Suck.\\" The lesser known \\"Last,\\" \\"Happiness in Slavery,\\" and a cover of Adam Ant's \\"Physical\\" (also hidden) are no less memorable.  Instrumentals \\"pinion\\" and \\"Help me I am in Hell\\" help round out the CD.<br /><br />Back in 1992 when CDs were relatively new to consumers, having ninety-one silent, second-long tracks separate the final two songs from the first six may have been cool and inventive.  Now, however, it seems kind of pointless.  Still, it's no big deal.<br /><br />If you are a fan of NIN, \\"Broken\\" is just as essential to own as any of the studio albums.
0307276902|5.0|Of course there are some repercussions of embellishing a memoir, especially when current addicts and alcoholics may be relying on your \\"truths\\" to carve out their own recovery plans.  That aside, Frey's fast rolling, visceral storytelling is compelling and unparalleled.  \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" should not be missed - even if it should be characterized as fiction.
6305308659|4.0|Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are completely convincing as siblings who are sucked into a 50's black and white sitcom.  Nerdy Maguire is as pleased as the proverbial punch, while Witherspoon is dead set to get back home, or barring that, to drag the entire town into the 90's.  As she leads them merrily away from their innocence, color erodes the complacent attitudes of them all, with some serious foot-dragging (headed by the always terrific J. T. Walsh).  Joan Allen is dynamite as the kids' sexually awakening mom.  Adroit social commentary never sacrifices the comedy.  Truly delightful, and leaves you much to think about.
B000AP04FG|2.0|...I thought it would never end.  The movie is somewhat entertaining in places but the scene where they are trying to kill each other bothered me.  Domestic violence is not funny.  At one point he is putting the boots to her, then a few minutes later they are in each others' arms.  Some may say that it is just a movie but in our crime-ridden city we don't need to glorify the life of a hitman.
B000056HE9|3.0|I liked this remake even more than the original and I love old movies best! Check out \\"The Preachers Wife\\".

B00082ZS5W|5.0|I had seen the concert previously on a broadcast on the INHD channel, where it was broadcast in 1080i and Dolby 5.1 for sound, and was blown away.  Dido's music really translates well to live performances, much better than studio albums I believe.  She totally nailed every song and revealed a lot about herself in between songs in explaining what inspired them.  An execellent performance.
B0002OERI0|5.0|People have been saying how Green Day has changed. How they aren't the young singers causing mayhem. How they aren't the ones they used to be. How they have sold themselves out.  <br />No matter what most people think, I'd say Green Day has changed, but for the good. Of course they're not going to be the same like in Dookie. How can they in their 30s? It's impossible for them to be like they were when they were 20. It wouldn't look, nor sound good. Green Day has matured, and whether people like it or not, they are going to stay that way. All the great bands mature in their lifetime. Just look at bands like the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and the likes. Maturing hasn't made Green Day less credible, in fact it as perfected their sound. Take for instance songs like Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends. These songs speak to us in ways that we never thought Green Day possible. American Idiot depicts a Green Day more concerned about the world issues going on right this minute. They have a new sound that's still very catchy. <br />Green Day has grown up, however their sound remains the same, if not better.
0739308742|1.0|I have not finished the book so I don't want to give an opinion about the book itself, but I have listened to the first two CDs.  The reader used for this book is more disgraceful than the most ridiculous impression of William Shattner.  The way he reads mocks every word of the story, with non-sensicle pacing and changes in intensity that make it difficult to keep up with the volume control.  The first three books had a reader that was the best I've ever heard, this one is simply the worst.  Please Random House and George Martin bring back Roy Dotrice. <br />I had trouble listening to this in the car because he goes from whispers to shouts, I could not find a volume setting where I could hear all the words and my ears weren't bleeding.
B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas is nothing short of excellent. The mafia is a very interesting subject in life. It's amazing to see how everyone acts in their groups and kills other people that act the same way. Goodfellas capture the mafia scene I think in a very accurate picture.
0783117523|5.0|This is a very good movie, this movie jump started Angelina's career.  she played the part like it was her last and it showed in her performance.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to admit I thought buying this CD was a bad idea. The only reason I bought it was for My Immortal and Bring Me To Life. I didn't expect much of the other songs. However, I was given a big surprise when I heard it for the first time. This whole CD is amazing. The songs are eerie, heavy and at times scary. At the same time they're something different from the usual they put on the radio.  <br />The vocalist of Evanescence is sure to give you a goosebumps. Standouts on this album are My Immortal, Bring Me To Life, Going Under, My Last Breath and Taking Over Me. <br />Overall, a great CD and I am certainly looking forward to their future work.
0689853637|5.0|I was introduced to Mr. Sabuda's books by my sister. She is a teacher in Michigan and taught Robert in third grade.  I have several of his books and love to give them as gifts.  Winter's Tale is lovely and as cleaverly constructed as all his works.
B00004ZD69|5.0|With this album GYBE simply sweep aside the rest of the field. Sprawling over 2 discs, the epic `Life Your Skinny Fists...' is a tour-de-force of GYBE's unbelievable ability to create beautiful yet shatteringly powerful `soundscapes'. The wall of sound they have become known for is better than ever, the powerful moments are sure to get your adrenaline pumping and the softer periods are just so touching, they make me feel like a big lumpy sack of uselessness. This album will hit you hard if you let it.<br /><br />The first track `Storm' instantly (well, over its 20 minute course) shows what GYBE are all about. The mood changes are simply perfect, the band weave in and out of themes, from beautiful and calming melodies to sinister driving sections. `Static' is my favourite GYBE song, it takes a while to get going with numerous samples and introductory themes, until it enters its main motif played sinisterly by the strings, gradually building to a full band onslaught that defines crescendo. `Storm' is a touching piece, once again a great use of sampling, but this piece is a showcase of the fabulous and inventive guitar playing, the sound is quite unlike anything I have ever heard...soaring...wailing...something completely ethereal. The title track is probably my least favourite of the four, but is still a fine piece.<br /><br />GYBE simply destroys the boundaries. Every piece and every individual movement inside it, is utterly compelling and brutal. If your interested in post rock, or are already a post rock fan but without this (gasp!), then I cannot recommend this enough.
B000957O82|4.0|I absolutely love this movie, I can really recommend it! Even if you are not a huge fan of Will Smith...go and see it, it's worth your money. It's about a man( Will Smith)who really got it going on, who has his act together so to speak. He is smart,sophisticated and not forget to mention good-looking ladies!! Albert on the contrary is a sad and lonely guy who needs help with the ladies...and I do mean desperate help. Who will be better at helping him than...need I say more...just go and see it, for all the ladies out there and men don't be afraid it's not one of those chick-movies, if you're feeling desperate yourself maybe you can get something out of it as well!!
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Romance, adventure, science fiction, Broadway, the movies---and all the elements click. Robert Armstrong is solid as daring showman Carl Denham. Fay Wray is superb as Ann Darrow (actress and the object of Kong's affection. Rounding out this trio is Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll, splendid as the first mate and Anne's human lover. As for Kong he is surprisingly believable even 73 years after the film's initial release. Last note, you may actaully wish to skip Son of Kong on this dvd the story is honestly second rate in that one.
0767817710|5.0|This is only one of a handful of movies I have watch multiple times, however, this is the first time I have seen any version other than the \\"TV\\" version.  The DVD version was much more intense, more detailed, more exciting - - - Only regret is that I had not ordered it much earlier.  The Quick and the Dead is still a movie I can watch again and again.
0307276902|1.0|On Plum T.V. the author of this pack of lies lied totally about his life experience.  It was an incredible performance by a lousy writer who is nothing more than a con-man. James Frey is the George W; Bush of writers; his entire episode of his prison experience is a toal hoax.  Why anyone would now buy this book is unfathomble, unless he or she is a complete idiot in total denial.I hope that its  ranking at number one is the result of Oprah Winfrey ordering thousands of copies to use to burn in her fireplace to cut down her heating bill. <br /> <br />What is frightening about this entire business is how much denial there is in America. From the jerks who still believe Bush is right abouat Iraq to the fools who consider Frey a great writer about essential truths, Americans across the boards tell the world that they want to be lied to.  As P.T. Barnum put it, \\"There's a sucker born ever minute.\\"  Hitler once said in a speech, \\"Reason deceives, the emotions never lie\\"  This is a country ready for a new Hitler to pander to its emotions at the expence of reason, a quality denegrated by a culture of infantile stupidity that values lies over the truth because it feels good.  Shame on Oprah and shame on the publisher of this trash. But most of all, shame on the jerks who buy the book.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|this was my first offspring album and it was amazing back then and it still is. in this album the offspring graduated from punk to rock but they definately didnt sell out... the offspring is a legendary band and have been around almost as long as green day but instead of playing stadiums (which they definately could) they play the warped tour. they definately did NOT sell out.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece.... you know an album is great when the most popular song is the worst on the album. Pretty Fly gets old fast but is good for a listen here and there. other than that you never need to skip any tracks. my favorite songs are Have You Ever, The End Of The Line, and Americana<br /><br />bottom line: if you are new to the offspring start here! then work your way back in time because it just gets better you will be hooked.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This story had a really great start with excellent performances by Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. Unfortunately during the point in the story where Tim Robbin's character was a prime murder suspect, because there was a large amount of blood in his car made no sense, because with current advanced  blood and dna testing, the police could have determined that the blood was not from Sean Penn's daughter. Without giving away too much of the plot there were alot of other elements of this story that just did'nt work in this current decade of internet, phone, dna, blood, and forensics advancements. Perhaps it would have been alot more believable during the late 60's or early 70's.
B000002BPS|4.0|this album has its high points and its lows. it starts great with a cool intro and my favorite song on the album \\"the meaning of life\\" but the 4 songs following it really need to grow on you and even then they arent that great. the two singles \\"gone away\\" and \\"all i want\\" are great of course but you could just get the greatest hits. the only real reason to get this is for \\"meaning of life\\" \\"amazed\\" \\"way down the line\\" \\"dont pick it up\\" and the intermission is funny. it just seems like they were trying too hard to make another Smash. i would definately recommend it over their self titled album and conspiracy of one. so if you own ignition, smash, americana & splinter pick this one up
0671449028|5.0|I bought this for my 18 mo. old, and even though he doesn't sit very long for books yet, this is a good one. Cute story, and I know it will be one we will be reading over, and over.  This is a great little chunky book for little hands.  Good for a last book before bedtime.
0689853637|5.0|What a wonderful piece of artwork...love it and put it out for the holidays! Everyone whether adult or child simply adored it! A real coffee table book for the season! Highly recommend all of his work! I now own 3!
1594200696|5.0|The Elements of Style Illustrated by William Strunk Jr. is a welcomed edition to my desk. The artwork gives the otherwise dry information some flare. I am enjoying it.
0743454537|5.0|I read this book as it was chosen as the \\"One Book, One County\\" selection for Kent County, Michigan.  It is a wonderful book which I highly recommend.  While it is a novel of fiction, you can't help but think that this story could truly reveal itself in real life.  The ethical dilemmas presented are endless and very thought provoking.  I often put myself in the shoes of the character Sara, the mother, and wondered what I would do if faced with the same situation and decisions that had to be made.  The novel also has a great unexpected ending which I won't say anymore about so I won't spoil it for anyone.  Again, an excellent book and well worth reading.
B0007GBBVO|4.0|OK,there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3D set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film. The Plot is pure ham and cheese. A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula, Frankenstein,The Werewolf of Paris, and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life.( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height.If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this. Only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like Camp Blood this is a masterpiece.

0679422714|4.0|As long as one takes Chang's research with a grain of salt, then this is an immensely enjoyable, readable, and accessible book.  The research seems good, but Chang's conclusions are almost laughable; she cites one or two sources (sometimes Communist sources, always of doubtful trustworthiness) and comes to conclusions that should send off red flags according to just their language:  \\"This must mean...\\" \\"There is no other interpretation but...\\"  And it can't be coincidence that all of her research unwaveringly supports her main tenet, that Mao is a monster. But the errors are so glaring that no one can seriously read this and not realize that it is a sensational, and not an entirely historically accurate, biography. <br /> <br />I don't doubt the ultimate conclusion (Mao was among the most evil characters of the 20th century), but I'm afraid Chang's sensationalism will only lead to a backlash of people defending Mao.  All the same, I really enjoyed this book.   <br />
0140277447|5.0|With the publication of this book, we have been given a chance to learn about one of the most gruesome episodes of the twentieth century. In the space of seven weeks from December 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army raped, killed, and tortured hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war and innocent civilians in Nanking (present-day Nanjing). Iris Chang details and analyses this event with passion, intelligence, style, and a sense of duty to the forgotten victims of Japanese barbarism. <br /> <br />The book is organised into three main sections; the first looks at source material of the Rape as it happened from Japanese, Chinese and Western perspectives. The second section is an analysis of such things as how the Rape was reported on at the time, how the Japanese who perpetrated these crimes were, or in some cases were not, punished, and what became of the survivors of the Rape. The third and final section looks at historiography; the ways in which 'history' is made. Chang also attempts to ascertain why a shocking level of selective amnesia seems to surround the Rape, in both Japan and the West. This reduction of the Rape to a mere footnote in most history books dealing with World War Two is what Chang calls 'a second Rape'. <br /> <br />'The Rape of Nanking' is not a light book, and it contains descriptions and pictures of acts so brutal and sordid that it is impossible not to be shocked. But rather than merely describe the events which took place, Chang also sets out clear and convincing arguments about why they took place and in this way she also offers insights into human nature. When faced, for example, with the apparently irreconcilable politeness of Japanese people with the brutality of their soldiers in Nanking, the author argues that politeness may actually be linked to brutality in a Japanese cultural context; Samurai were entitled to chop off a peasant's head if, when asked a question, the peasant did not answer in a way which the Samurai deemed polite enough.It is these immensely perceptive discussions which help make 'The Rape of Nanking' such an important and intellectually powerful book. <br /> <br />In a book crowded with the details of horror, Chang also details the heroic stories of people who, through amazing strength and determination, managed to survive the horrendous mental and physical pain of the Rape. Also interesting are the stories of people such as John Rabe, a Nazi Party Member resident in Nanking at the time of the Rape, who was the head of the committee which ran the Nanking Safety Zone. Dubbed by Chang to be the Schindler of China, Rabe is credited with helping to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of Chinese. <br /> <br />Ultimately, 'The Rape of Nanking' is about how, in Chang's own words \\"the veneer of civilisation seems to be exceedingly thin - one that can be easily stripped away, especially by the stresses of war\\". The book ought to be read, because it will go some way to redress the lack of knowledge in the West about the Rape, but also because the event still impacts upon Sino-Japanese relations to this day. The Rape of Nanking is an event which we should learn about and never forget, and with this book, Chang has given us the opportunity to do so.
B0002OERI0|5.0|My friend has this CD and I plan on getting it someday she got me into GreenDay becuase I never really liked them but I liked the song Wake Me Up When September Ends. Then I listened to her cd and I was like wow... So I have to get!
B000BKVQTS|4.0|This movie basically tells the tale of Brothers Grimm, the famous fairy tale writers, and how they got started.  (Purely fictional, I am sure.) <br />Two charlatans duping superstitions townsfolk for money, they end up encountering a real life fairy tale/ghost story. <br />Amazinly beautiful sets. <br />Hilarious if slightly unexplained and mishmashed characters. <br />Awesome performances by the two lead actors. <br />This movie was quite visually pleasing, had a fun and interesting story, and was quite humorous as well.  A little bit of Python humor thrown in... but mostly of its own flavor. <br />There were some points were actions and situations felt a bit out of synch, or felt like something was missing or skipped, though... last minute or bad editing of content, maybe? <br /> <br />I recommend this movie highly, and I think it is unfortunate that people didn't give it much of a chance in theaters. <br />I particularly loved the way that odd or supernatural encounters throught the movie were pointed out to be the settings, characters and events that would later be included in the Grimm's Fairy Tales.
0385507755|1.0|So satisfying to have this creep exposed as a liar and plagarist. As a recovering addict myself, I felt his drug history never rang true and then the whole 'I don't need a program or support and can do this on willpower alone' flies totally in the face of conventional wisdom. It smacks the face of the over 4 million people who are recovering in the rooms of AA and NA. So happy to see the smug sh*t fumbling thru interviews today. I only wish there were negative star ratings.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love the alien quadrilogy and to have all of them in one box is great! I especially love all of the extras including the conceptual artist and other really interesting information about the filming. If you love sci-fi movies, it's a MUST HAVE!!
B00005JOQ9|5.0|Being a huge fan of horror, terror, gore, etc... I went into this movie with immense expectations. A good friend of mine (who is into the same type of films) saw it a few days before me and she claimed she actually had to turn away from the screen at times. When she told me that, I was foaming at the mouth to get to this one. <br /> <br />Without giving away any details I will say that I did feel there could've been a little more brutality but for a \\"mainstream\\" it was nearly over the top. I honestly can't believe that this movie only got an \\"R\\" rating. I may be too desensitized to violence in films from all the gore I've seen but I don't know the last time I saw this much blood (not to mention T&A) in a movie at the theatre. <br /> <br />This is another movie, like \\"Cabin Fever\\", that must be taken for what it is: a fun, shocking gore-fest. I don't know why so many people gave this bad reviews. Were they expecting an art-house story? Would anyone expect academy award nominations for these types of films? Come on, people... <br /> <br />Roth hit the nail on the head with this one and I look for his future films to get better and better. After all, look where Peter Jackson started out. Does anyone want to call him a hack or a bad filmmaker for his early attempts with \\"Bad Taste\\" or \\"Dead Alive/Brain Dead\\"? No, because anyone will tell you when you watch those films you must take them for what they are. Same rule applies to \\"Cabin Fever\\" & \\"Hostel\\". <br /> <br />I can't wait for an unrated/director's cut DVD to find out what the censors actually wouldn't let fly in this one.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I really enjoy the music on this CD. <br /> <br />In answer to the question below, however, the music playing at the end of the movie trailer is \\"PM's Love Theme\\" which is found on the Love Actually Soudtrack (Import Version).
B0002X314C|5.0|I love John Legend Im a huge fan. I love this album. If you dont have it. You gotta go get it. This is what real music should sound like. I got the chance to see him perform live at the Apollo Theather in New York City. Wowwwwwwww best concert Ive been to to date. His music his voice has so much energy. I LOVE HIM now and Ill love him for years to come and support his music Forever. I hope one day I can meet him and tell him how great his music and voice is. To the haters out there who say my man cant sing? Just explain why this man is Platinum and nominated for 8 grammys? Haters fall back and stop hating!

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a modern day masterpiece. I have read many of the older classics and would rate this with the likes of 1984, Lord of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye etc... One recent reviewer rated it Metaphors for the Masses and really downgraded this book. I looked at his other reviews and his favorite movie has Bill Murray in it?? Give me a break. Anyways, the book had me thinking several days after the read. I did not want to read another book so I could absorb it all. A real treat!! I wont go into the story because its all in the reviews. I can tell you that if you liked the Sixth Sense, Jacobs Ladder or Beautiful Mind, this book is right up your alley!!

B000683VI4|2.0|The Notebook was, as a romance, kinda cute and endearing in some ways but there was one point of the movie that was fatally flawed.<br /><br />This notion that if you LOVE SOMEONE ENOUGH you can snap them out of the Alzheimer's fog. Now what does that do to us folks in the real world who have spent years and years at the bedside of someone sinking into the abyss of Alzheimers?<br /><br />No doubt, the lead character is portrayed as being a truly remarkable and passionate man who loved his wife so completely that nothing could kill his love. That's all well and good and we need more movies that portray undying devotion in the face of great hardships (because life does take those turns now and again), but...<br /><br />If you want an honest portrayal of Alzheimer's, if you want to know what it's really like for the families and spouses coping with this, rent or buy \\"The Forgetting\\" (also at this site).<br /><br />In an online interview, James Garner was asked if he had any personal experience with Alzheimer's and he replied, \\"I had an Aunt Emma. She was funny. She couldn't remember me or my brothers or her sisters or anyone.\\"<br /><br />I had an Auntie, too, and she had Alzheimer's and she couldn't remember me. For five years, I took care of her and that experience, difficult but spiritually demanding, was nothing like the character portrayed by Gena Rowlands in The Notebook.<br /><br />Any movie that falsely portrays Alzheimer's can't merit all the praise that this movie has been showered with.<br /><br />Rose Thornton
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is a classic! It will be hot for years and years to come. John Legend is nothing but the truth and has a beautiful voice. If you don't have the album I highly recommend it.
B00009UW0N|2.0|I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The 13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I have a hard time believing that this album is not getting very good reviews from the critics (at least it doesn't seem to be from, what I can gather). It makes me realize how shallow and silly the whole business is. They (the \\"critics\\") are beginning to remind of a bunch of pansy 7th grade boys.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is far better then what I had expected and has been in constant rotation since the day I purchased it. For whatever reason, Room on Fire never really lit my lid, so I was sort of expecting the law of diminishing returns to set it. Not so with 1st Impressions on Earth. It is pretty clear the Strokes put alot more time and effort in creating a complete album here. I believe that this is by far their most complete album to date. In fact, I have been racking my brain to think of another rock n' roll album that is this complete. When I say complete, I mean an album with a group of incedibly strong songs of various styles yet with a cohesive \\"sound\\". This one has it all.  <br /> <br />It has harder edged tunes, like Visions of Division, Ize of the World & Juicebox along side more poppy tunes like Razorblade & Red Light. It also contains some great straight ahead Strokes tunes, like You Only Live Once and Eletricityscape (one of my favorites). Even though the songs are varied in styles, they all are of a piece. <br /> <br />At first I thought that the album would have been better had they left 3 or so tunes off the album. However, I have come to believe that every song is really strong and deserves to be on the album. Evening Sun sort of reminds me of a great old Kinks song, Killing Lies grows on you like a weed & Fear of Sleep has become one of my favorites on the album. The refrain where Casablanca sings \\"Your No Fun\\" sort of reminds me of the old bombast of U2. I love it. <br /> <br />Deep, rich, thick, it has everything you could want in a rock album, and then some.

B0000062FN|5.0|I rate this album (cd) at the \\"Zenith for the popular set\\" because I actually rate Caravanserai slightly higher.  Santana III is actually Abraxas on steroids.  This is when the band was at its best live too.  I've seen this band and all of the new incarnations (except the late '70's Santana bands).  From Batuka to Everybody's Everything\\" to the live material, this band smoked.  The addition of Neal Schon, really pushed Carlos to really express himself.  Schon, at the time 15 or 16 was a plus for the band and a perfect foil to Carlos' lyrical guitar.  You can hear Schon's solo's scream of youth and rebellion which must have made Carlos think \\"uh oh, I have to follow this?\\"  Carlos on the other hand blazes particularly in T'saint L'Overture and in Guira.  Let's not forget the powerhouse percussion section of Carabello, Escovedo, Areas and Shrieve and David Brown's driving bass.  Greg Rolie's perfect voice and excellent keyboard playing is the backbone of the band.  If only this band would reassemble and tour again, of course unfortunately with the passing of Brown and Escovedo that cannot be.  If you like driving rhythm, great fiery guitar and keyboard solos, look no further, this album defined this type of music.  I wish there was a band that does this now.  We were almost treated to that with the short-lived Abraxas Pool, but alas, Schon decided to pursue Soul Sirkus, Rolie went to do his own band and Carlos has chosen to accompany the popular with today's youth artists.  BUY THIS and ENJOY!!!

6305308659|3.0|Technically, the film is great. I think we're all agreed upon that.Have to admit though that, when it first turned to black and white, I did feel like turning it off. Not because I don't like authentic black and white - but because I thought it was going to be the faux variety Well it was, but for a legitimate reason that becomes self-evident. I'm glad I stuck with it. <br /> <br />It felt like the film had a lot to say but I don't think it did so articulately enough or effectively enough. It is sometimes confused. Example? Reece Witherspoon as the slutty sister who turns into a bookworm (like \\"Grease\\" in reverse) whilst, conversley, her \\"Mother\\" is liberated from the kitchen? What was that about? And Tobey Maguire's cookie-baking girlfriend? Just another damsel in distress role in the time honored tradition that remained unchallenged. <br /> <br />Yes, the film has good intentions. It wants to say something worthwhile but somehow it fails - but at least it tries! And, it has to be said, it is a damn sight better than Jim Carey's \\"The Majestic\\" - a film set in its own Pleasantville without ever managing to either challenge or entertain.
6305428387|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. Its great fun for all ages. It combines a lot of humor with the age old tradition of the olympics, especially bobsledding... who would ever think Jamaica would have  a bobsled team? This is one of my favorite movies and I'd suggest it to anyone.
B000002U9E|1.0|I did not like this cd at all.  There was not even one song that I liked. <br /> <br />However, given the positive result the cd received, it may just have been my personal taste.  I also got her new cds, and did not like those either
B0001WTUH6|1.0|Having a lame voiceover layout the overwrought and ludicrously worded backstory in the beginning starts off Underworld on a bad note and it dives even further down from there into a carnival of bad dialogue, Matrix rip-offs (visual and score), lame rubber suited werewolves, and crappy characters. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful but what a bad way to have to show it off.
B000068PQ0|4.0|For being such a \\"cutesy\\" album I found Yoshimi's Battles a bit hard to get into at first.  For one thing I was expecting more standard instrumentation, and to this very day I feel the electrofied \\"cut and paste\\" drums are what holds the albums back.  Steven Drozd is a good drummer, I SWARE...  This albums in by no mean 'militarist' as a couple 1 star reviews have called it.  This album is paraniod, uncomforted by the forward grind of technology and displaying such emotion by using electronic sounds to make you feel slightly uncomfortible.  It's truely genious in that respect.  Though this a great album from end to end many of the tracks fall short when compaired with others.  The best tunes rang from the poppy \\"Flight Test\\" and \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1\\" to the electronic tsunamis of \\"Ego Tripping\\" and \\"Do You Realize?\\".  Summertime, one of the albums more normal tunes with it's use of guitar, slowly evolves into pure electrona by it's end.  The lyrics are relitively deep and certainly not candyish other than the rather straight-forwardness of them.  But the final thing truely holding this album back for me is that it always leaves me feeling roughly the same as when I started where a truely great albums leaves me feeling uplifted, and while certain tracks here do (Do You Realize in particular) the album as a whole does not.  Remember though, this album takes time to understand.  It's central theme isn't robots, but mortality and technology (which I guess is best inbodied in robots...).  Take some time to crawl into it, don't expect to enjoy it the first or second time through because it's too self contradicory in it's \\"humanly electronic\\" nature to be comfortible.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Great to see this classic in its restored beauty. The extra features make for enjoyable viewing and a fuller understanding of the movie. Info provided by Peter Jackson was very informative, especially about the \\"spider caves\\" missing section.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD set.  I was initially undecided over buying the set with or w/o the bonus DVD.  However, I would recommend getting the one with the bonus material.  It was fun to watch the bonus disk first to learn some of the tricks they used in making the films, and then to watch all of the films in order.

B00028HBKM|1.0|Just for the sake of being clear: I am Christian liberal, I don't believe in miracles including virgin birth or the resurrection and I disbelief the gospels as a historical account. <br /> <br />Watching the film awoke many feelings in me. I only saw the film in the DVD and not the bonus parts <br /> <br />Jesus is portrayed as a reflection of Mel Gibson in his Lethal weapon-films. If you remember, he breaks his own arm to get loose and it seems that Jesus goes thru the same phase as Mel when getting whipped or crucified. The milieu of Jerusalem is dark and devilish in the film. Some flashbacks makes Jesus remember his childhood and his period of preaching, but that is all. <br /> <br />Mel has created a fascinating symbolism in the film, like how Judas hangs himself with a rope, coming from a dead corpse of a donkey ... or when Satan - as a androgyn scray being - tempts Jesus to give up sending him a snake - Jesus crushes the snake's head alluding to the so-called prophecy of Genesis. <br /> <br />It has - I have to admit - some warmth in all the blood and the anti-semitism, in all the violence, its warmth comes from the \\"nice\\" people around Jesus: the two Maries, Peter, John, Nicodemus and it has that special Catholic mysticism, alluding to stigmata, crucifix and visions. <br /> <br />It is Mel's Jesus who appears in the film, a Jesus who is hated by Jews and punished by them and excusing the very horrible Pilate - which by the gospels is portrayed so innocently. But this should be accepted in the frame of faith-promoting films, `cause I hardly believe that Mel would have given Buddha or Muhammad the picture that he gave Jesus. <br /> <br />What is sad is also the fact that Mel thinks that it was Jesus' pain that delivered humanity from their sins, in my church, the Swedish Lutheran church, the fact that Jesus died and arose together accomplish a miracle, it is not the fact that he was tortured or that he voluntarily asked getting whipped till the flesh dropped down. <br /> <br />In Sweden the film received a cold welcoming and I believe that I am talking for many Swedes who have cultivated a strong independent picture of religion and its effects. Many saw the film as nothing more than a Hollywood version of Jesus the Rambo. What was welcomed was the fact that the film was in Aramaic and not Shakespearan English. <br /> <br />Whatever the language spoken: it is Mel who is speaking or his falang of ultra-conservative Catholics.  How wonderful it would be that Christians who hired cinemas in order to show the film could have put their money for people who needed it and not to brainwash others with cheap tomato ketchup dripping from a mutilated man's body. There are countries - as US, Saudi, Tchad -who still condemn people to death and torture them. <br /> <br />I can picture the film as a wakening about the horrible death penalty - but as everything it is easy to judge things passed than things occurring right in front us. <br /> <br />1 star, cause the film could never ever capture the message of Jesus' 30 or so long life, his wish about the best for his people, for his followers and do remember, his anguish of being put to death. See Jesus in every human being, be it Iraqi prisoners, be it homeless and not in Mel's auto-refelction of himself! <br />

B000BB14YY|5.0|This film is awesome in the truest sense of the word.  Throughout the film you can't help but be in awe of Akira Kurosawa's vision as a director.

0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is the most influential Asian film ever created, and it is perhaps one of the most influential films of all time, east or west. Without Seven Samurai, there would have never been Magnificent Seven, or much later on the anime Samurai 7.<br /><br />Most people know the story of Seven Samurai. A village of farmers is threatened by bandits and, instead of rolling over as had happened many times before from many villages before theirs, they decide they must defend themselves, and wish to recruit samurai to aid them in their battle. What makes the story great, though, is the cast of characters, who are still original after fifty years. First, there is Kambei, the fearless samurai so used to losing he doesn't mind the prospect of dying. Second is Katsushiro, the \\"child\\" samurai, who only wants to learn but does not exactly realize what a life as a samurai entails. Third is Kikuchiyo, the comic relief and also the man most affected by the events surrounding the village. Fourth is Shichiroji, an old comrade of Kambei's with a skill for rousing men to battle. Fifth is Heihachi, a light-hearted samurai who knows what it takes to win, and when is the right time to lose. Sixth is Gorobei, a man who lives life more by his curiosity than by anything else. And finally, there is Kyuzo, a master swordsman capable of killing with every swipe of his katana. All of these men, though nearly strangers to each other in the beginning, learn to not only depend one another, but trust each other implicitly, and they do this all for the chance to have two or three square meals, total, as payment for their protection. When put together, it's a story of spirit and honor, as well as the will to survive.<br /><br />I do have a couple problems, however, though it's not exactly with the movie itself, but with the DVD. Firstly, the subtitles don't seem right. Unless it truly was written that way, I don't think samurai would say \\"Sheeyit\\" which is a play on the Anglo-Saxonism for feces. My second problem comes with the huge price. Forty dollars is just too much to pay for a movie, no matter what it is, especially when there are no extra features to speak of besides one commentary track and trailers. Though Seven Samurai is one of those pictures that should be seen by everyone interested in film, I'd rent it before I'd spend all of that money (sorry Amazon).es.

B000BM6AVA|1.0|Yes, this is very fast and aggressive Klazsmer music sung by Squidward in his neo fascist anti Bush save the world stance.  Ever thought that this would be cool?

0553801503|2.0|I found the first three books utterly engrossing and devoured them in record time, loving every storyline and the author's writing style, despite the fact that some of my favorite characters were horribly slaughtered.  I could not wait for A Feast for Crows and had almost given up hope that it would ever be released.  Now, after years of anticipation, I'm slogging through it, searching for a story.  Yes, the attention to detail is glorious, but for me, meaningless.  I want attention paid to the characters and storylines that matter; instead, I'm overwhelmed with names, places, histories, mythologies, geneologies . . . . . . I find myself skipping entire chapters just to get to something interesting.  It would never have occurred to me to skip a single word of the previous three books.  I can only hope the next book will be better.  Regardless of what I think of A Feast for Crows, I intend to see the series through because the initial story was so incredibly compelling.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is absolutely breath-taking! Josh has a real powerhouse of a voice but what is truly special about him is the depth of emotion that he is able to convey with his voice. This guy is staggeringly talented. He cuts right through to the core of the song each time and leaves you glad to be alive and glad that there are people with such jaw-dropping talent.<br /><br />A word to the reviewers who dissed Josh's singing in Italian: as someone who is half-Italian and fluent in the language, I can assure you that his pronunciation is absolutely flawless. He sounds like he's been speaking/singing Italian his whole life.<br /><br /> If you only ever buy 10 CDs in your lifetime, this should be one of them.
0425173739|4.0|Well, I'd read this before, of course, when I read all of Christie's works in chronological order, and I remembered rightly \\"who done it\\".  A good yarn with all the pieces fitting just so.  And it actually mentioned The Mena House in Cairo where I have stayed.  And a Nile cruise and Abu Simbel.  Perhaps things have not changed so much there since Christie wrote this story.  Very romantic and tragic.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|So if you saw it in a theater like I did you lost 2 hours...so imagine owing it in a dvd and watching it all day!!! The stupidity we have to watch nowadays...My only comment in reviewing this movie is that it has nothing -no story, not fun, not dialogues, not characters but had to be done for some people to make their money. So don't feed them damn it!!
0131479415|4.0|I'd highly recommend this book to anybody leading a team using agile methods on a small to medium project (1-20 people for months to a year or so). It contains easily reusable tips on estimating the project cheaply upfront, adapting the plan as you go, measuring and reporting on progress towards the end goal, and even throws in some basic financial analysis. I've used very similar methods on mid-sized projects in incubation and production phases with success.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this for any project that is either large in size or contains complex or unstable dependencies. When people and product lines scale, the process needs to as well, and the chapter on \\"planning the multiple team project\\" should be used with great care if you scale up above about 20 people or have to take dependencies on software that is unstable or still under development. Projects like those require significantly more work on the part of project leaders to keep the interactions from throttling a team - go elsewhere for tips on handling that in an environment with teams doing agile planning.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I really love this movie and it would be absolutely perfect if not for its occasional lags in interest, especially during the space in which the two convicts lose their friend to the Sirens. But, I'm jumping ahead...let's get to the review.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a great musical experience which begins with a 1930's singing chain gang, voiced by James Carter and the Prisoners (found on your best Blues collections.) That goes straight to \\"Big Rock Cany Mountain,\\" a bluegrass favorite, as we cut to Pete, Delmar and Everett hauling ass through a field, having escaped the gang and are searching for freedom. Amazing way to open the credits.<br /><br />Once the boys are on their way, we get to meet them. Everett, played by Clooney, is a know-it-all with an obvious education and a vain care for his hair. Pete is an angry country boy who loves conflict - John Turturro is great in this part. Delmar is their sometimes innocent, always simple-minded end to the trio. Everett has talked the other two into escaping with him to find the treasure he stole, buried, and was sent to jail for.<br /><br />This is a sometimes loose adaptation of Homer's \\"The Odyssey.\\" The Cohen Brothers have admitted to never reading the book but they seem to have really studied the cliff notes front to back. If you look closely, you can find every piece of the film's inside to the poem. For instance:<br /><br />The prisoners find a blind railpusher who tells their future just as Odysseus was told his by Tiresius.<br /><br />Everett's first name Ulysees is Roman for the Greek Odysseus.<br /><br />The Sheriff plays the part of the Devil. But, I think, the GOV candidate is supposed to be Poseiden. THAT IS made thinkable by the fact that the CYCLOPS/John Goodman is his minion.<br /><br />The trance-like prayer flock that goes to the river to pray are just like the drug-addicted \\"lotus eaters\\" that Odysseus has to keep his troop away from.<br /><br />John Goodman's Dan with the eyepatch is one-half of the \\"Cyclops.\\" The other half of the Cyclops (which Odysseus outsmarts) is the blind radio announcer that Everett swindles out of extra money.<br /><br />When Everett goes to find his estranged wife Penny (Odysseus' Penelope), he finds that she has found a suitor. Odysseus finds his wife and family overtaken by many suitors.<br /><br />Everett gets beaten down by the suitor just as Odysseus gets jumped by many suitors.<br /><br />It goes on but I won't list them all. What I want to mention the most here is the sterling sountrack. It's got a little blues, a shade of country, but tons of bluegrass that I had no idea I was a fan of until I saw the movie. Great favorites all around, well integrated into the movie. Parts that I loved the most in the film are...<br /><br />\\"Damn! We're in a tight spot!\\" (you'll know what I mean)<br /><br />The opening.<br /><br />Tommy the guitar player.<br /><br />The major-hot Sirens.<br /><br />Every time the boys sing \\"Man of Constant Sorrow.\\"<br /><br />\\"Angel Band\\" from the end credits.<br /><br />It really is one of the Cohen Brothers' best. Check it out if you love literature, imagination and music.eus outsmarts) is the blind radio announcer that Everett swindles out of extra money.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I don't care if this film is `faithful' to its literary source.  I've never read Jane Austin, nor seen the much-touted BBC miniseries, so I'm fortunate enough to view this film on its own merits.     <br /> <br />This is an excellent film with wonderful cinematography and a slightly gritty, realistic setting.  The camerawork is elegant and almost Wellesian in its graceful fluidity.  (Such a relief from the normal hyper-MTV editing that presupposes we all have attention deficit disorder!)  The acting, in general, is excellent.  I found the Darcy character to be somewhat bland, or cipher-like, but that reflects probably on the material and not MacFayden's performance (though hard to tell if I haven't read the book).  Maybe it's better to have a blank screen in which to project female desires upon? <br /> <br />Ms. Knightley gave a wonderful performance.  Very likeable, passionate and intelligent.  Passionate, in the sense of expressing all her feelings, not just romantic-love yearnings.  She will have an interesting career.  Ms. Knightley displays a wonderful personality on talk shows and seems oblivious to her natural beauty.  She was wonderful in `Bend It Like Beckham' playing a bit of a tomboy, and can obviously play more refined (and costumed) characters with equal charm.  The only thing that can prevent her from becoming the most popular actress in the world within five to seven years is if female moviegoers are more threatened by her beauty than sympathetic to the characters she plays. <br /> <br />Final note:  The coda scene.  The producers did not show this scene in England and obviously rate the average English intelligence or taste higher than our American ones.    <br />

Now my review; I promise I'll be as honest and impartial as possible. I love you MADONNA! <br /> <br />1)HUNG UP: This is the best way to start the album. This song is catchy and easy to enjoy, you can dance and have a good time when you listen to it; I must say the lyrics are really honest too. Who hasn't felt that way? My rating: 10/10. <br /> <br />2)GET TOGETHER: In my opinion this is the best song on this album; it's irresistibly danceable. \\"Do you believe in love at first sight? It's an illusion, I don't care\\". Madonna proves here that she knows how to have a good time. It should definitely be a single.My rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />3)SORRY: I'm glad that Madonna and her company have chosen this one as a single because it'll be a great hit, I'm sure of it. Again the melody is really catchy and the lyrics are very good for those ones who think they can play with your heart. \\"I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know, please don't say you're sorry\\". Let's dance! The first three songs sound very nice together. My rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />4)FUTURE LOVERS: Honestly this song spoils the good time we were having with the previous songs; it's not that it's a bad song but it takes so long to get danceable! the part where she sings \\"In the evidence of its brilliance\\" makes me wanna skip it.Definitely not as good as the other ones. My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />5)I LOVE NEW YORK: Again, not as good as the first three songs but definitely much better than FUTURE LOVERS, the rhythm is very catchy; I don't find it very danceable, though. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br />6)LET IT WILL BE: I have read many reviews saying that this is one of the best songs on the album but honestly I don't think it's that great because it's very repetitive. Something that I do like about it is the rhythm and the way she sings here. My rating: 7/10. <br /> <br />7)FORBIDDEN LOVE: I must thank Madonna for releasing such a beautiful song. This is pure sweetness with a melody that moves me even though it's not a ballad. God! I love this song so much! I listen to it every day because it's by far one of the best songs on this album. \\"Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?\\". Thank you again. My rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />8)JUMP: This song is very enjoyable and catchy that I'm sure it'll be a single, though I would prefer GET TOGETHER and FORBIDDEN LOVE as future singles. Very nice song. \\"Are you ready to jump?\\" So jump, because this song will make you wanna do it. My rating: 9/10. <br /> <br />9)HOW HIGH: Another good song, the beat here makes you wanna move your body. \\"Nobody's perfect, I guess I deserve it\\" Where did I hear that before? There are some effects on this song that work perfectly. My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />10)ISAAC: Why did she have to release this song on this album? She should've saved it as a B-side or something like that because this is the song I never listen to; it begins well, but then we hear 300 times \\"Mmm mm mm, Im nin'alu, Im nin'aaalu\\" and that is too much! I think the problem is the chorus, that \\"mmm\\" doesn't work here. My rating: 6/10. <br /> <br />11)PUSH: Again, this song is not that good, but it's effective. In my opinion, the problem here is the bridge and the chorus, the rest is good. I like it, though. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br />12)LIKE IT OR NOT: Good message, terrible song; not danceable, not enjoyable. However, her voice sounds really good here. My rating: 5/10. <br /> <br />Ok everyone, I have been very honest as I promised. God Save Our Queen.  <br />
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Jennifer Connely gives such a superb acting performance in this movie, that you can actually feel the pain that she is suffering within as the movie progresses.   She is aided and abetted by other high quality and journeymen thesps, such at Reilly, Roth and Postelthwaite.....and the net effect is acting performances , the likes of which, you rarely see in any kind of movie of this genre. No need to go over the plot, since many have read that a million times....if you want to see a well crafted, slowly building chiller, this is the movie for you. How anyone can say it is not scary? Why?  Because there were no senseless decaptations and severing of limbs??  Tension most certainly builds, and every dark and brooding corner of the hallways of this building will give you the creeps. I was stunned at how well this picture was put together!
B000BVD460|5.0|Well, what can I say about it? I got this album as a present a week ago and I must say it is really good. The only thing I don't like is the fact that there's one song that is missing here, it was a big hit here in LatinoAmerica: ASS LIKE THAT. I was thinking of buying \\"Encore\\" to have it but I have read so many bad reviews here that I changed my mind. However, this album does have many of their greatest hits, and yes, \\"When I'm Gone\\" is really good. Eminem, you've got many fans here in Per.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|I watched \\"Mommie Dearest\\" a week or so before seeing this movie and that movie showed the pressure and tension Joan Crawford was under when this movie came around to her.  She was already considered a has-been and had been dumped by Mayer's studio and so it was quite a triumph when she won a best actress Oscar for this film.  And well deserved it was.  It's a great film about a powerful, but flawed woman/mother and what she does to keep her life and her daughters' lives bearable. One of the top 100 films ever, in my opinion, both for the performance and the story it tells.

B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a superbly haunting film, one so affecting that I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about it. Beautifully acted, directed, scored, shot, located and heart-wrenching, Brokeback Mountain is likely the Best Picture of 2005. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give career best performances, creating portraits of two men in love, but distinctly different in their capacity to understand and accept what has happened between them, and particularly who they are.   Ang Lee is truly one of cinema's best directors, who's deft handling of different genres (American comic book mythology, sublime Chinese martial arts ballet, 70's era suburban East Coast drama, 19th century pastoral English romance, etc.) continues here. He uses the contrasts of stunning wide open space and isolation, physical and internal isolation. The need to battle the elements alone versus together. The attempt to mask and repress the heart with tradition, denying the rebel. There is also much metaphor to express the opposing natures of men and women. For example, Jack's (Gyllenhaal) evolving submission to his father-in-law is developed over a few scenes, ending in a relieving turkey cutting scene that clarifies his maturity and acceptance of himself. But the moving images of Ennis (Ledger) alone, in stoned paralysis are what haunts the film. His disconnect with what he feels propels the story, his fear and uncontrollable passion wreak havoc on others too, but mostly on himself. Ennis is the romantic and the pragmatic of the two, and tortured by a true love he can't accept. While Jack is the flamboyant and hopeful one, who's sexuality he learns to embrace.   But homosexuality is secondary in the film. And just as time period is (it starts in 1963 and travels 20 years) important, it represents a time when cowboys (America's mythic man) were dying out; the residents of ghost towns, made up of young guys needing to be their fathers, etc. To which the differences between Ennis and Jack also evolve. One remaining the ranch hand/herder, the other going into business and wealth.   But the timelessness of this is primarily in the relationship itself, equally passionate and distant, unable to blossom in an intolerant world, but especially in a fearful one.   For the culmination of a long term love to be \\"I swear,\\" left me knowing that even when I can't get out of my own way, there is a fight to be had, against the intolerance, fear and torture of a world which masks it's truths with worse fears.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Hands down this is the best DVD of a live band performance I have ever seen. Not only does it capture the 2 days of action which took place during the Milton Keynes show in England back during the summer of 2005, it also captures what life on the road is like for the guys in Green Day; everything from how they view their fans, to how they prep for their performances. It also contains interviews with Green Day fans who were at the performance. The CD is also a really nice feature because it contains the audio from the concert and many songs that are not on the American Idiot album. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of Green Day or just Rock and Roll in general. This is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The sooner you buy it the sooner you can rock out!

0307276902|1.0|Amazon has deleted my previous review so I will post another. <br /> <br />Reading \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is a waste of time.  It is poorly written, has no satisfactory plot or character development, and the events described are unbelievable, even ridiculous. <br /> <br />James is self-centered and immature and does not improve as the book drags on.  I had a difficult time relating to him or caring what happened to him.  The characters are stereotypical and dissapointing. <br /> <br />Overall, the reading experience is very unsatisfactory.  I would not reccomend this book.  There are plenty of good ones out there to read, don't waste your time with this one.
0064407667|4.0|I recently read this book and it was fairly good, and I'm sure if I were younger I would have enjoyed it more. You are introduced to Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire whose parents just died in a tragic fire. They are sent to live with Count Olaf who is horrible to them and is desperate to steal their fortune. The whole book is about their experiences living with Count Olaf and how badly they hate it their. It's kind of funny how Lemony Snicket tries to explain everything to you. I think he's making fun of child authors who try to explain things that are obvious. Anyway, this was a fairly good book and a quick read for 9-11 year olds.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|The movie served it's purpose. It's a fun action/adventure movie with tons of beautiful under water footage. I highly enjoyed this movie.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|\\"Scary Monsters\\" was released in the fall of 1980 and served as a fitting coda to the 1970's, a decade where Bowie was nothing short of larger than life.  It also served as his swan song to RCA and his last album until 1983. <br /> <br />In the album artwork as well as the groundbreaking \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" music video, Bowie pays homage to his mime days in the 1960's.   The entire album seems as such a homage to his 1970's catalog, and it has become regarded as one of the finest gems of the catalog. <br /> <br />The album is bookended by \\"It's No Game\\", pt. 1 starts off the album as a really hyper punkish track, and pt. 2 reprises the same song, but is more of a straight ahead pop-rock song, completely losing the madness of the original. <br /> <br />\\"Up The Hill Backwards\\" follows and is a classic in the catalog.  Definately one of Bowie's most underrated gems. <br /> <br />\\"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\\" is another great track, with it's fake dog barks and overall claustrophobic feel, it's a great track to listen to every October. <br /> <br />\\"Ashes To Ashes\\" was the first single off the album and frankly one of the greatest recordings Bowie has ever recorded.  A \\"sequel\\" of sorts to Space Oddity, as well as depicting his mid-70's coke addiction, you can't say enough good things about this song. <br /> <br />\\"Fashion\\" is the funky dance track here, perhaps an homage to Young Americans/Station To Station, this was the biggest hit off the album and the video was a big hit on MTV. <br /> <br />\\"Teenage Wildlife\\" is the most reminiscent of glam Bowie on the album, as well as one of the most autobiographical tracks he's ever recorded. <br /> <br />\\"Scream Like A Baby\\" is a hard rocker, where Bowie is singing a song from the point of view of a homosexual during the Holocaust, a very haunting track with Bowie sounding his most deranged, a total masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom Come\\" is the token \\"sing along\\" track on the album,one of the albums most upbeat tracks, but ultimately most forgettable <br /> <br />\\"Because You're Young\\" really had the makings of a hit single during 1980-1981 but alas, it never was released,  definately providing a case of \\"what if?\\" <br /> <br />This album was the epilogue to Bowie's first round of \\"Golden Years\\" and has become one of his biggest cult classics, and it's not hard to see why, the entire album is great start to finish.
0307276902|1.0|As I read AMLP I kept wondering if the publisher mixed up their galleys and mistakenly sent an angry, 14-year old's fantasy to press. But no, Frey has named and claimed this as his life's story. Too bad. It's awful and awfully fictional.<br /><br />My problem with Frey is that if he'd lie about or fabricate institutions (Hazelden, jail) people (himself, Lily) events (train wreck, jail, his rep) and \\"recollections\\", then what's true?  Better yet, does it matter? For a memoir, yes. For a novel, not so much. So then the question is this: if this were marketed as the novel it is, would I like it any better? Answer: never.<br /><br />Frey writes like someone pretending he's lived the life he's only imagined and representing it as truth. His false bravado is annoying: he never stops screaming, venting, pushing and shoving. I found him exhausting, and not at all sympathetic. Most of all, I can't get past the notion that anyone who claims to be in recovery by \\"Holding On\\" is peddling lies. Sounds pretty un-recovered to me.<br /><br />This is just trash masquerading as a stylistic memoir. It's neither stylish nor true (nor memorable). Don't bother.<br /><br />PS - For an account of battling addiction that's written with pathos and grace, pick up Styron's DARKNESS VISIBLE or read the online articles of Wendy Mnookin and Seth Mnookin at Salon.com.
B00001OH7X|5.0|1979's Lodger is the album most people tend to forget from David Bowie's career, and it's a real shame because I think this is one of his five best albums <br /> <br />After two avant-garde masterpieces with Brian Eno (Low and Heroes), Lodger ups the ante.  Gone are the instrumental pieces, but in it's place is even more attitude and Bowie really cuts loose during this album, pretty much merging the Eno albums along with the more straight-ahead rock which was to follow with next years \\"Scary Monsters\\" <br /> <br />\\"Fantastic Voyage\\" gets the album off to a great start, a fairly nice and pleasant (and conventional compared to the rest of the album) slower-paced rock track. <br /> <br />\\"African Night Flight\\" is where all hell breaks loose, definately one of Bowie's oddest recordings but you cannot get it out of you head, especially Bowie's \\"raps\\" and the chanting. <br /> <br />\\"Move On\\" is another great and very memorable track. <br /> <br />\\"Yassassin\\" is the albums reggaeish track, the type of song you will sing along with. <br /> <br />\\"Red Sails\\" is IMO, the weakest track off the album <br /> <br />\\"DJ\\" is one of Bowie's more ubiquitious numbers, recently broadcast in XM Satellite Radio numbers that Bowie happens to appear in.  Even though Clear Channel didn't exist in 1979, DJ totally puts radio corporations like that in it's place. <br /> <br />\\"Look Back In Anger\\" is a somewhat rock-disco number with a somewhat religious message,  short but sweet <br /> <br />\\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" is the best known track off the album if for nothing more than it's controversial video <br /> <br />\\"Repetition\\" is a song about domestic violence that ironically is addictive <br /> <br />\\"Red Money\\" is the masterpiece off the album, one of my favorite Bowie tracks ever.  The song is a sonic assault and the production is absolutely perfect, and the song itself is fantastic.
B00005B36H|5.0|Ive had this album for 5 years and I can honestly say this may be the greatest most dynamicly geneous album ever released.  My mind trips over itself well in the trance of tools imposible music.  Every time I listen to Lateralus i think in my head \\"HOW THE HEEEELLLLL?????\\" I still cant understand the amazing complexity and underated composition of sounds.  This album is highly emotional and spiritual.  Maynards voice is \\"healing\\" in ways nothing can describe. <br />
B000002BFZ|5.0|After letting a few years pass on both No Code and Yield, they seem to get better.   <br /> <br />Binaural and Riot Act present a significant dropoff from the aforementioned No Code and Yield. <br /> <br />While No Code and Yield are not as good as Vs, Ten or Vytalogy; their dropoff from the first three albums is less significant than the dropoff to Binaural and Riot Act.   <br /> <br />Got All That?   <br /> <br />And for the MTV crowd, any of this is preferable to your Jimmy Eat World, Fall Out Boy or Blink 182.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I purchased this music DVD earlier this month because I wanted to see Led Zeppelin in action after for so long. <br /> <br /> I began casually listening to Led Zeppelin roughly 5 years ago, but didn't become serious until 2 years into it. The more and more I discovered their songs, the more and more I needed. Therefore, my heavy addiction came, I was officially hooked. <br /> <br /> However, when I began to look for footage of this amazing band in 2005 it was tough! Hallelujah!!! I discovered that Led Zeppelin put out a DVD in 2003. Here is the real kick, it not only revives old canned footage of film from their live concerts, but it's remastered in DTS 5.1 surround sound! It has Kashmir... I am sold, period. <br /> <br /> This DVD is simply amazing; I finally got to see the big deal about this band playing live. Robert Plant's wide vocal range is mesmerizing, Jimmy Page's guitar playing is wickedly scary, and Bonham with his drums is simply amazing! The only person you hardly see is Paul Jones, but there are some cut scenes with him. Either way he helped with the entire experience. <br /> <br /> I am not going to talk about the contents of the DVD because there are plenty of that in this website. <br /> <br /> DISC TWO is my favorite because you get a wide variety of songs, but the de facto reason why it's my favorite. One word: KASHMIR  <br /> To finally hear and see this song live from Led Zeppelin especially in DTS 5.1 sound was a long time coming. <br /> <br /> The sound and picture are amazing for 30+ year old pieces of tape. I didn't expect this to sound extreme crisp and sharp, but held pretty nicely in DTS. The picture looks pretty darn good a little rough with some footage, but then again keep in mind this was a back in the 70's! <br /> <br /> If you are Led Zeppelin fan get this NOW! If you are not, but want to see the big fuss is all about? Purchase it and discover what this band is all about. Then buy the Compact discs. :) <br /> <br /> Give it a shot;it's truly a steal for under $25! <br />
B0000TB01Y|4.0|The soundtrack is best enjoyed by those who have seen the musical.  The score is enjoyable and stands on its own as great music.  For those not familiar with the story, it will leave them a bit confused because some key elements of the story are left out.  Perhaps this was intentional to prompt the listener to see the play.
0684135051|5.0|this is a really great book. I like the writing style oif elisabeth zimmermann very much: she witty and intelligent and it's great to have her talking to you with this book. she quite unconventional, and that's what's nice about the book too. <br />a must have!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Producer/Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and director Joel Schumacher have further elevated the cult status of Gaston Leroux's 1911 penny-dreadful by finally turning Lloyd Webber's stellar 1986 stage musical into this lovely cinematographic masterpiece.    Admittedly as of this writing, I've yet to see a live stage version of the musical, but as an owner of a copy of the original London cast recording of \\"Phantom\\" for 15 years  prior to seeing this film, I'd had the \\"Phantom\\" soundtrack in my head for years, and had always wondered what the film version would be like.    As is the case with the stage production, liberties are taken with Leroux's novel in the film. The story of the Phantom's reign of terror begins in 1870 in this movie--nine years later than the original stage production, and eleven years earlier than in the novel. The physical appearance of some of the characters is derived from the stage musical rather than the novel as well.    While I've regretted that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not recreate their phenomenal onstage roles in this movie, I appreciate the sensibility of using younger actors.   Scottish-born Gerard Butler's 6\\"2\\" frame is naturally more imposing than that of the 5\\"10\\" 1/2 Crawford's, and although I make mental comparisons between  the singing styles of Crawford and Butler, noting where Crawford's voice would have risen and/or become more breathy and sensuous, Butler is undeniably his own  man in that role, combining Crawford's  vocal sensuality with the boorish charisma of Russell Crowe. Butler's unmasked profile reveals a very attractive face with appropriately piercing eyes and a virile chin cleft.   Young Soprano Emmy Rossum's lifelong experience in the world of opera shines through in her performance as Christine Daae. While she lacks the sweet, stratosphere-piercing strength of Sarah Brightman, her youth makes her more believable in the part. Her soprano has its own dulcet style, but a listener feels as the Phantom does that \\"she has much still to learn\\". Her naivte and vulnerability  are deeply felt as she confronts the issue of whether or not this \\"Angel of Music\\" is the one promised by her dying father in her childhood. But she can face down the Phantom with equal amounts of courage and defiance when necessary.   Patrick Wilson sings the part of Raoul in softer and less vibrant tones than the late Steve Barton, but he is very expressive in his physical and vocal style, as he goes to great lengths to rescue the woman he loves.   Minnie Driver is pompous and over-the-top as the diva, Carlotta Giudicelli, but sings the closing number warmly and beautifully.  Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (the latter of whom previously appeared with Driver in \\"Circle of Friends\\") seem comically out of their league as the opera house managers, Miranda Richardson is matronly as the Ballet Mistress and Phantom confidante, Madame Giry, and a fetching Jennifer Ellison plays her daughter, Meg, who is Christine's supportive best friend, justifyably thwarted in her efforts to confront the Phantom by her mother.   The interspersed black and white scenes of the 1919 auction at the Paris Opera House gradually lend closure to the story.   One accuracy of the film is the Phantom's escort of Christine to his private chambers partially on horseback. But inevitably I noted the deletion of a stanza from the title song. Like all the numbers, the show-stopping \\"Music of the Night\\"  was admirably done, and one pays attention to the vastness of the shoes Butler had to fill especially in that scene.   As the lonely malformed genius coaches Christine for stardom supernaturally, he demands the improvement of the quality of the productions from the managers. After the senseless murder of a stagehand who knew too much, Christine and Raoul comfort each other on the roof, hoping to be out of the Phantom's earshot.    By the time of the New's Year's Masqued Ball,  they are secretly engaged. Ironically, the revelers sing ofvarious colors  swirling about the room while clad mostly in black and white. On cue, the dreaded regularly-masked figure comes to poop the party and demand the performance of his own opera. Shortly afterwards, Madame Giry reluctantly recounts the history of her relationship with the Phantom, to give Raoul a bit more insight.   A few scenes and one beautifully sung ballad later, the company prepare to take on the Phantom once and for all. But plans go awry, amid a fallen chandelier.  Christine plays her part to the hilt, especially in the dramatic build-up of the sexually charged \\"Past the Point of No Return\\".   Shortly thereafter, Christine has to make a final decision to save Raoul's life, and committs an act of pity that moves her tormentor deeply.   In the end, and emotional Raoul could feel somewhat bemused that his one-time detractor--who did evil things but was capable of arousing great sympathy--at least shared his taste in women.   But the twist ending evokes the question: Is the music of the night ever really over?
B000002KHH|5.0|Starting off with the politically fueled \\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall\\" (this isn't a whinny Good Charlotte attempt at a war song.. this is fast, loud and angry!) this album had me hooked by the opening sirens.  But if somehow this doesn't cut it for you the next track, possibly the catchiest gloomy song of all time, \\"Paranoid\\" certainly will.  This album is guitar at it's finest (Electric Funeral), drumming at it's finest (Rat Salad's solo), and simply put, Metal at it's finest.  Five stars is far too low.

0307276902|5.0|I got this book in the fiction section of Barnes And Noble's, in 2004.  There were three copies of it, and the beginning, instantly grabbed my attention.  By stating that it's trash because it's not real, is like stating.  I prefer to know this misery existed so that my life can look better.  And maybe that's what your searching for, a way to make yourself feel better.  But I read this, thinking it was One hundred percent fiction, not one thing real, and I liked it as a novel, taking in--not the stories he told--the message, of the story.  That it's not the end, that a person can come back from even the worst situation, take it as that, and you'll do well in life.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Seriously everybody here thinks they are a video editor, what's up with that.  Too many camera shots, what the hell does that mean?

B000002UA5|3.0|I can say this with a straight face, that this is a reason bands should not do individual work on an album, except The Beatles, of course. The studio side proves to be dissasterous for both Mason and Wright, considering both of their contributes don't mount to anything but a harsh reminder why Gilmore and Waters should be involved in their projects, pure garbage. Now there are a couple of enlightments though, Granchester Meadows, a calm and acoustical number, played by Waters proves he can write on his own, but his next number is pure crap and too long of a name to mention too. Now as far as Gilmore's contributions a Narrow Way 1-3, it's good guitar work, almost good enough to have been played on Pipers At The Gates of Dawn, for you Syd fans, or even his part 3 almost sounds as though it could have been on Abbey Road for the Beatles, only problem though with this set is David tends to mumbles thru his singing portion, making it kind of unclear what he is saying, think a little unissured. Now as far as the live stuff goes, all pretty good, especially Careful With That Axe, Eugene, clever, Set The Controls.... pretty well thought out, and a classic by Syd Astronomy Domine, very well laid out. It's downfall, Saucerful of Secrets, it's ok near the end, but the middle part of this song always irritated me for some reason. Anyhow this album should be in Floyd fans collection, others BEWARE!
B0000027I6|5.0|...that this album isn't better known.  It's certainly Waters' best solo work, and although his voice isn't what it once was, his creative powers are at their height here.  It's a concept album, all right, and unless you have a heart of stone the concept will grab you. <br /> <br />What you have to do, though, is listen to it straight through at least several times.  If you just listen to it casually, in the background, it may not jump out at you, and you may wind up putting it away.  Don't do it!  This album in some ways reminds me of Pink Floyd's The Final Cut, but in one way in particular: until you sit down with this, preferably in the dark with headphones, you haven't experienced it. <br /> <br />If you like Pink Floyd and never got this album (which as I recall didn't do very well sales-wise), do your penance and then rush out and get it.  Better late than never.
0780626966|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my sons and they like them. \\"Its Cool\\" they said.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|I think this album's great. Especially when Heavy Fuel rocks your <br />ass. I bought a few copies of it on CD, and I want to get this on <br />LP. This would be excellent on LP. Another song to rock out is The Bug. I think Heavy Fuel is the best song on the album. <br />It has excellent drums, and guitars and the lyrics are great. <br />This one must be in every rock collection. <br />Several songs rock out. <br />Why dosen't this ever get played on the radio?
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits were the greatest rock group of all time. Now this is Mark Knopfler's latest album and this contains excellent songs like Boom, Like That. It's some kind of song about Fast Food, McDonald's. Yeah I go there a lot. It's hell cool. I was at the Shangri-La concert this Summer 2005, and <br />man they played Boom, Like That great. It was the Greek Theater <br />in Berkeley, CA where me, my dad, my mom, and my partner went. It was on July 23, 2005 I think. It was that night before I went <br />to Georgia to see my family. My favorite song they did at that concert was Telegraph Road. I always wanted them to play Heavy Fuel but they didn't. Here was the complete list of songs I think <br />they played at the concert. <br /> <br />1. Walk of Life <br />2. Romeo & Juliet <br />3. Sultans of Swing <br />4. What It Is <br />5. Telegraph Road <br />6. Sailing to Philadelphia <br />7. Boom, Like That <br />8. Brothers in Arms <br />9. Money for Nothing <br />10. So Far Away <br />11. Our Shangri-La <br /> <br />It was one hell of a great concert. Why did they not include Calling Elvis, Heavy Fuel, or Tunnel of Love?
B0002OERI0|5.0|Sorry to use such a tired phrase like \\"classic\\" to generalize how I feel about this album but frankly, I am still riding high a month on after hearing this album in its entirety!  I am past my first prime - a girl raised on the original punk of the 70's - but this album has as much to offer its audience as the Clash's London Calling or the Pistols' Never Mind the Bullocks.  You must hear all songs, played as a whole, to truly appreciate the mastery at work.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns N' Roses were a great band, and they have one of my favorite <br />songs of all time, November Rain. Other than that, I like the rest of the album great maybe the best greatest hits album of all <br />time.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Well, nothing to complain about the movie, which is perfect. But I expected to find some paper material attached, onde it is a special edition! I only found an out-of-date \\"promotional coupon\\" to get a ticket to the Phantom of the Opera at Broadway. I almost cried!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day American Idiot is one of my favorite albums of all time. I was glad when I got this on LP, I own 3 copies on CD and I even own a book of this album. How great. I think Whatsername is a great closer for the album. Here's how I think of every song. <br /> <br />AMERICAN IDIOT great song for beginning. <br />JESUS OF SUBURBIA not a favorite. <br />HOLIDAY / BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS great song. Favorite. <br />ARE WE THE WAITING / ST. JIMMY starts out slow then rocks. <br />GIVE ME NOVACAINE / SHE'S A REBEL not bad but not a favorite. <br />EXTRAORDINARY GIRL / LETTERBOMB never liked this one. Bad. <br />WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS great hard rock song. <br />HOMECOMING probably the weakest song of all time. <br />WHATSERNAME a great album closer one of their best.
0060989157|5.0|This book is awesome for anyone who likes/liked Motley Crue.  It's kind of like a Rated R \\"Behind the Music.\\" It's very interesting & definitely a page turner!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I finally saw this after a long wait, and I must say its incredible. Please check it out!
0399152717|5.0|I have just finished reading this book in january 2006. I have read almost all of Clive Cussler's fiction books which are far better than his non fiction books. What I found interesting on this last few books I have read is that he mixes true facts with fiction. I have checked the concepts involved in this book in [...] and was amazed to find out that they are all true and exist and that is what makes this book so interest to read. I encourage reading it.
0380820846|4.0|As someone who has greatly enjoyed the three earlier books in this series, it is very satisfying to see wallflower Penelope Featherington finally get her chance to shine.  Penelope, best friend to Eloise Bridgerton, has been secretly in love with Eloise' brother Colin since she was sixteen.  It is now twelve years later, and Colin has never shown any romantic interest in Penelope and she has never married.  She is considered by her mother and the rest of society as unlikely to ever marry, least of all to someone as desirable as Colin Bridgerton.  Penelope is very reticent when she is in public, although she is forthright, clever and much-loved when she is among friends. Colin is her public opposite, always charming and confident and extremely popular.  He has just returned from yet another trip abroad and appears his usual happy self.   Privately, however, Colin is in a bit of a funk because he feels that his life has no purpose.  During his mother's birthday party, he has a surprisingly fun and thought-provoking encounter with Penelope and begins to see her in a new light.  Perhaps it is that Penelope finally had the courage to reveal a bit more of her wonderful self to Colin.  Colin is definitely intrigued, but does Penelope dare to hope?     I found the pace of this novel a little too easygoing and felt that there were too few love scenes - really only one.  However, the relationship between Penelope and Colin, and their many heartfelt and humorous scenes together, was terrific and more than compensated for it.  Both characters have secrets and parts of themselves that they do not show the outside world but, by accident or design, reveal to one another.  It is without a doubt that this couple is better and stronger together than apart.  I very much enjoyed this story due to the potency of its two likeable leads.    \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" is positively not a stand-alone novel.  To truly appreciate the remarkable Penelope Featherington, one has to first read the earlier books in this series.  Then you can savor her well-deserved happiness and success.
B000002U9E|5.0|\\"Hounds of Love\\" is a classic example of Kate Bush at her best. The dreamy beat of \\"Running Up That Hill\\" was Kate's first hit in the states and the first song that drew me to her as an artist. Side one (we used to have two sides back in those days) is a collection of singles including the title song, \\"Running Up That Hill\\", \\"The Big Sky\\", and \\"Cloudbursting\\". Side two is an arch of songs strung together. The highlight for me on this side is \\"Waking The Witch\\", which has you/her waking up from a good dream only to find that you are living in a nightmare. This is a cerebral, haunting tour de force from one of pop music's most powerful and original voices.
B000002IPZ|5.0|out of testaments prime (the first four albums)this is easily their worst, but souls of black is still way better than anything after this album. the first three albums rule, but \\"souls\\" still kicks ass.
0684824906|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my husband and he has already finished. He was impressed with the writing
B000002LQR|5.0|1. Power of equality.  This is the red hot chili peppers most politically active song they have written.  Great lyrics against discrimination and awesome funky chorus. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />2.  If you have to ask.  This is another awesome offering of funk, but the singing is a little odd for my tastes. <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />3.  Breaking the girl.  This song is awesome, one of the most original songs by the chili peppers.  Starts out with frusciante's classic strum style and never lets up. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />4. Funk monks.  Another cool funky song, but this one gets a little annoying after awhile. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />5. Suck my kiss.  This song kicks ass!  In your face, no nonsence and sensual rap rock that will have you banging your head and storming around like a madman. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />6. I could have lied. Even more mellow then under the bridge.  A sad song with an awesome guitar solo. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />7.Mellowship Slinky in B Major.  In my opinion this is the weakest song on the alblum. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />8.The righteous and wicked.  Cool song which is more slow paced then there other funk songs. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />9. Give it away.  this is their second most popular song of all time.  Great song, but personally I wouldn't put in a top 10 rhcp list.  Still a great song though. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Blood sugar sex magik.  Hilarious song, funky and sexual. <br />8.5 <br /> <br />11.  Under the bridge.  Everybody knows about this song, their most popular of all time.  Probably John's most impressive guitar preformance of his career, and that is saying ALOT. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />12. Naked in the rain.  Love this song, it's about leaving humans and running around with animals naked. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />13. Apache Rose Peacock. Pretty random song, great beat. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />14. The greeting song. Love this song, reminds me alot of \\"easily.\\" <br />9/10 <br /> <br />15. my lovely man. Sounds alot like the greeting song, both our awesome. <br /> <br />16. Sir Psycho.  This is simply my favorite song of all time.  Dirty but Beautiful lyrics by anthony with amazing rythmic chemistry by the rest of the band.  The last three minutes are a beautiful instrumental that fit perfectly with the first part.  Again, this has to be one of anthony's best song lyrics ever. <br />11/10 <br /> <br />17. Their red hot.  This is just a little screw around, but I love it, it's really catchy! <br />8.5/10  <br />
0307276902|1.0|My prior review was deleted as well.  Here is what I said: <br /> <br />What the book describes is unbelivable.  Whether it is true or not, is is a bad book and a chore to read. <br /> <br />James is constantly trying to exhibit what a macho guy he is.  He is selfish and stupid and his big accomplishment in the book is to scorn the AA method of recovery, rebel, and go his own way.   <br /> <br />The book is horrible, don't read it if you can help it. <br /> <br />
0553573403|5.0|It took me halfway into the second book of the series to finally get an understanding of the characters in the epic.  You get hit with a lot of characters and place names in the first book.  But each character is individually unique.<br /><br />It is almost overwhelming to keep the myriad characters and families separate and in proper time and space.  But, take heart, after the first 1200 pages, the story settles into order in your mind.  You begin to understand and follow the struggle as it unfolds.<br /><br />Other than the main families, you never do fully understand the different factions involved.  Thankfully, a handy appendix at the end of each book helps answer your questions.<br /><br />Once you get through the awkwardness of a new character's viewpoint with every chapter (which I don't recommend as a writing style) by the second book you have a strong understanding of the author's world and the story pulls you in to it's epic proportions.  You find yourself hooked and eager to read what problem your favorite character(s)are facing.<br /><br />Near the end of the second book you begin to see the author's model of the \\"seven\\".  Each must play a part.<br /><br />You will find yourself tempted to skim a particular character's chapter.  We each have our favorites.  However, it is best to take the time to read each chapter thoroughly as the story and it's characters unfolds with bits and pieces in each chapter into an epic whole.<br /><br />It is a somber book.  There are rarely moments of light levity.  There is sexual frankness.  The violence is graphically described.  It will affect your mood.<br /><br />But, there is a magnetic appeal to the series.  Be prepared to feel yourself drawn to the books.  Your demeanor will be a bit heavy and thoughtful after each reading. You will find yourself thinking about the series when it is not at hand.  The books haunt you.<br /><br />Enjoy, but be prepared to be shocked, hooked, and consumed by Martin's series.tin's series.
B000BTGY7I|4.0|I purchased this item and found that disk one was the old superbit edition without the commentary track.  I emailed Sony and they quickly responded saying that this was a mistake with the first production run.  If you mail in disk 1 along with the proof of purchase and copy of the email from Sony, they will send you the proper disk 1.  So, if you have this dvd with the wrong disk one, just email Sony and they will tell you what to do.

B0000033P0|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am a pretty big ELP fan.  Trilogy, Brain Salad Surgery, and Pictures at an Exhbition are all consistently brilliant, and while the self-titled debut is a bit inconsistent, it definitely has its moments.  However, Tarkus is consistently bad and in my opinion one of the worst albums of all time.  Of all the 20+ minute suites of the prog genre (Atom Heart Mother, Karn Evil 9, Close to the Edge, 2112, Lizard, etc) Tarkus is by far the worst.  It is pretentious, boring, barely listenable, and lacks any kind of musical coherence.  The other tracks are all pretty weak as well, Bitches Crystal and Time and a Place being the only spots on the album with any kind of musical value.  Are You Ready Eddy is vomit-inducing; it doesnt even have the comical value of the far superior Benny the Bouncer.  If you are just getting into ELP but Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery, but avoid this unless you want to laugh at how bad prog can be.
B0000029AP|5.0|This album definately lives up to the hype. It was a sign of good things to come and I don't know how to finish that sentence(...). Anyway, at 1st I thought Rocks was better but now I think Toys is even more incredible. Let's face it, none of Aerosmith's albums are \\"underrated\\" except for maybe their debut and Get Your Wings. Walk This Way and Sweet emotions are the most played songs on Toys In The Attic but they live up to their names. The 1st time I heard Big Ten Inch Record, I thought,\\"Holy crap is Steve gonna say it???\\" due to the lyrics:I'm gonna get her goin with my big ten inch...record.But nope. It's a rather bizzare song(in my opinion anyway) but it's still a catchy little number. Uncle Salty is probably the worst song here but Aerosmith's worst is still better than most bands' best. No More No More can only be described with one word:Brilliant. As always, there's Steven Tylers screaming vocals, Joe Perrry's powerful lead guitar, Brad Whitford's...undetectable rythm guitar, Tom Hamilton's deep, bluesy bass, and Joey Krammers...drumming(...). Anyhow, this album is worth your $15 and you'll love it for years to come!
B00005B36H|5.0|This CD is definitely Tool's best to date. With tool now saying that they are going to release a new cd this spring of 2006, it would be 5 years since there last release. They really put some time into this release. The four songs that are on the radio are \\"Parabola\\", \\"Lateralis\\", \\"Schism\\", and \\"The Grudge.\\" The biggest hit on this CD was \\"Schism.\\" In my opinion Tool has the best drummer out there. This is definitely one of the best CD's of the new Millenium.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Squash here, just doing my part to nudge this thing back up to 5 stars. It's an amzing album that only a mature person can listen to. As a progressive rock fan, it definately tickles my fancy. May I suggest Exit Music(For A Film), Subterranean Homesick Alien, and Climbing Up The Walls? I like that Thom's voice kind of sounds like Bono's voice. Oh, and to that malnourished flaming homosexual MTV Supporter, I wouldn't be talking if I were you. To you, music is entertainment, other people want  to hear music they can relate to or somehting like that. For any of you who are looking for a good laugh, look at MTV Supporter's other reviews. Now get back to your preshish Good Charlotte and leave real music alone you loser. I would also like to point out to all the other retards who come on here and say this album is for miserable, lonely people who wanna commit suicide, I would like to point out that I am a happy [...] who has lots of friends and is actually against suicide. I'm off the subject, back to Radiohead.<br /><br />  Anyway, this album is flawless and you should buy it...LIKE NOW!!!<br /><br /> Not one song is bad. I won't lie, however, the 1st time I heard it, I didnt like it very much, but after sa while it grew on me. Airbag is really strange, it has lyrics that seem to talk about rebirth. I also really like the guitar riff in the beginning. Parnoid Android has some incredible guitar work on it, and it sounds like it could be made up of several songs. Subter... is the hihglight of the album. It seems to be about a man who despises his neighborhood and wants to live with, well, aliens. Exit music is really beautiful, and one of my favorite songs ever. Let Down may not be any less depressing than the last, but is definitley a relief from the silent rage of the last track. Karma Police appears to be song about prejudice and racism (karma police, arrest this man he speaks in math). Fitter Happier is the most bizare song here, as it is spoken by a robot, but I personally think it's a cool song. Electioneering is the album's rocker, and one of my favorites off the record. Climbing Up The Walls is my 1st favorite song off the record. It has incredibly creepy electronic vibes and cool lyrics. No Surprises is actually a song, well, asking for no surprises, and one of the best off the album (I'm wearing that phrase out). Lucky appears to be a song about blind luck and has  great lyrics. The Tourist is probably the worst song here but Radiohead's worst is better than most bands' best. And besides, it's not even a bad song! HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!s a cool song.

B00001U0DP|4.0|This film is truly a delicious film that makes you want to jump with joy. BRILLIANT! Ive read the other reviews and some i feel are way too politicaly correct! This film  shouldint be looked at like that. I agree that the second part of the film is a Rather radical. Is it correct to make a comodie out of the Holocaust? But then this film is so life inspiring that one should ignore this. DONT LOOK AT THINGS SO NEGATIVELY! This film shows you that no matter how bad things get, life stays \\"beautifull\\"!Enjoy!

B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is absolutely terrific! Rent or buy it, quick! All of the actors were superb, especially Emily, and the prosecuting lawyer. When he was imploring the jury to, please, deliver a guilty vote- it was a great scene, and very convincing. <br />     I saw this movie first in the theater and the whole audience sucked! All these humans trying to be funny and do their comedy routines- so annoying. And the two fat losers sitting behind us acted like they were in their living room on the couch. They talked and commented nonstop in loud voices. This was a horror movie, yes, but with a serious tone and subject. This was wasted on a majority of morons who witnessed it. Pity for those wastes of skin! <br />      <br /> <br />
0895260131|5.0|This book will be of great interest to those who realize and don't realize that Islam has come to the West and is not going home.  Europe has given away their Continent to Islam through masssive immigration from the Muslim world.  It is all over but the shouting for Europe.  Islam couldn't conquer Europe by sword but will in the future out populate native Europeans in their homeland.  This will have a serious impact on Europe and the entire world. <br />     The history of Islam, it's teachings and what this means for the West and the rest of the world is discussed in an interesting format.  Every detail of Islam cannot be analyzed in the scope of the book however even the reader who knew little about the religion will have a comprehendible knowledge after finishing.  The comparisons between Christianity and Islam are very insightful. <br />     The truth about the Crusades and their impact on the world are discussed.  Don't depend on the politicially correct movie, Kindom of Heaven, for your facts.   <br />     The PIG series that I have read so far have both cut through the bull and been to the point which is what I like. It is imperative to know the truth about Islam and it's impact in the West and world now. <br />

B000002KBA|4.0|This CD in musical circles is supposed to be Deep Purple's most reverred recording.  Don't get me wrong, its quite good.  However, I prefer Fireball and Machine Head a bit more.<br /><br />One thing I must say is that this recording is clearly Deep Purple's heaviest recording.  That opening track, Speed King is oh so loud and fast. I like the use of Little Richard lyrics.  The best track on this is Child In Time.  Love the build up to this one.  Ian's vocalizing just rules and the solos between Blackmore and Lord are stupendous.  The other tracks have fairly memorable moments.  Truly a winner on all accounts.
B000002542|5.0|Although America's melodic hard rock band Journey is most popular with their multi-hit producing Steve Perry era, the band actually started a lot earlier than Perry joined them. Formed by two former Santana members, Gregg Rolie on keyboards and vocals and Neal Schon on guitars, this amazing band actually captured a very nice progressive rock sound on their debut album. Though the following Gregg Rolie era records also had progressive elements, their self-titled release may be their most fusion-inspired release with amazing synth and organ sounds, killer dual lead guitars, and a fantastic rhythm duo.<br /><br />Joining Rolie and Schon are drummer Aynsley Dunbar (also of Fank Zappa, Jeff Beck and Sammy Hagar fame), bassist Ross Valory and second guitarist George Tickner. This is also the only Journey release with Tickner on second guitar, as he decided to leave the music business after recording the album. Actually I'm of the opinion that Tickner and Gregg Rolie may have been huge factors in taking on a progressive songwriting attitude on this disc, since the band slowly departed from this approach on their following releases. Tickner not only supports the amazing Neal Schon, laying down choppy lead work, but he also wrote the instrumental track \\"Topaz\\", punctuated by deft acoustic passages and big synth washes. Gregg Rolie's organ sounds are huge, but he always gives Ross Valory enough space to provide a full bass bottom and drummer Dunbar to add some sick polyrhythms akin to his work on the earlier Zappa albums. The band delves into a mesmerizing jam session towards the end delivering fluctuating rhythms, awesome cymbal sounds, and a full-fledged keyboard lead. On \\"Of A Lifetime\\", Rolie introduces his trademark organ sound where he experiments with almost psychedelic soundscapes that would even surprise the biggest Eloy fans, but it is Neal Schon's unique sense of melody and phrasing on the guitar where no element overtreads each other. On this song, he goes from slowly building arpeggios to jaw-dropping whammy bar usage and finally fierce lead soloing as he is eventually joined by George Tickner for a full-on guitar attack in the outro. The other instrumental \\"Kohoutek\\" starts out as a moving piano ballad before gloomy guitar chords are thrown into the mix as pounding drum beats are heard and suddenly the listener is caught amidst madly wailing twin guitar harmonies, Moog sounds, jumping bass lines before things calm down and the piece concludes with a nifty piano melody, almost the same way it started. Among all these fusion-styled compositions are also shorter synth-pop tunes like \\"To Play Some Music\\" (which yet closes with another fusion solo) and the somewhat bluesy ballad combo \\"In My Lonely Feeling / Conversations\\", two songs that are merged into a single framework. The first part is hook-laden and melody-friendly displaying a beautiful vocal performance by Rolie, while \\"Conversations\\" is an all instrumental cut filled with rich bass and keyboard textures.<br /><br />Unlike the Perry era, the Gregg Rolie albums all retain a characteristic prog vibe while still aiming at a more mainstream direction. In this respect, Journey might quite possibly be the one and only band which successfully balanced these two different visions. Though far from being commercially viable, I consider the first three Journey albums absolutely essential for any melodic prog rock fan that enjoys beautiful songwriting, defined by otherwordly guitars and excellent synth work, not to mention the amazing drum and bass combination of Valory and Dunbar.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Though far from being commercially viable, I consider the first three Journey albums absolutely essential for any melodic prog rock fan that enjoys beautiful songwriting, defined by otherwordly guitars and excellent synth work, not to mention the amazing drum and bass combination of Valory and Dunbar.     Highly recommended. Give this disc a try.
6300214184|5.0|Jennifer and her strugle to succede is an all american story.
B000301YY8|5.0|First, on the album... James' compositions are simple (like Howie Day and as a guitarist I know what I'm talking about) but very melodic, he's a great song-writer, I usually don't really care for the voice but he has a very good voice too (not irritating at all as two ignorants said here... listen to My Chemical Romance to see what is an irritating voice). <br /> <br />Secondly on James Blunt... HE is NOT a poser unlike 95% of the music stars (won't name any because there are too many) today, James is simple and doesn't have a big head because he passed from soldier to the stupid fame, he stays James Blunt and I respect him for that. <br /> <br />The album has many good songs and in my whole life so far I didn't find many albums with many good songs, maybe the only one in 2005. <br />If you love acoustic songs like me, buy this album and you won't be disappointed! <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|Shame on the author, Shame on Oprah for being unable to say she was deceived too and continuing to endorse the book, but most of all shame on Anchor -the publishing house- for not having the integrity of calling things by its name: a lie.  <br /> <br />Anchor should be boicotted for its disregard for the truth and lack of respect for its readers.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Johnny Depp is always amazing in his portrayals.  This movie is no exception.  I honestly thought this movie would be dark (althought the book wasn't) because of the trailers.  I was pleasantly surprised.  With the immense advances in computer generation, the old \\"Willy Wonka\\" doesn't stand a chance, visually, against this new version.  The oompa-loompas were great.  The show was very enjoyable and good for the whole family too.
0316779237|5.0|Truly the author's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on Christmas, parents, children, evangelical Christians from Kentucky, television, Macy's, the result of a dalliance during the Viet Nam War, and \\"keeping up with the Joneses\\".<br /><br />This short book is much funnier than his best-selling \\"Me Talk Pretty Some Day\\" as the author's humorous cynicism is at its best.  One can't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the American psyche.<br /><br />Three of the stories appear to be autobiographical (with obvious changes made to \\"protect the innocent\\") wherein the author \\"tells\\" the others in the guise of another.<br /><br />Regardless, Sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches, even if there's a little guilt attached to that feeling.
B0007GADZO|2.0|Steve Vai is easily one of the top five most versatile and technically gifted guitarists this country has produced. It's too bad you can't find a whole band of first rate musicians like this here. I think the problem with America not producing great \\"progressive\\" rock bands is that when a prog rock artist such as Steve Vai comes along, he wants to run the whole show and be in a band that features his name rather than simply being one of five or six permanent members of a band. In other words, there would be no Rush if Geddy Lee just wanted to be in the Geddy Lee Band, or no Yes if Rick Wakeman  just wanted the Rick Wakeman  band. Such is the problem with this CD. Everything goes in the direction Steve Vai wants it to go to suit his mood, whether you get it or not. You know how in movies when two people are walking side by side talking, and one of the characters is talking all the way and the other guy just keeps saying uh-huh until finally he stops in his tracks with a puzzled look on his face, silently muttering the last sentence the first guy said while that guy just keeps on walking and talking, not knowing his buddy has stopped because he was thrown for a loop at the last thing he said?  That first guy is supposed to notice that his buddy has stopped keeping up with him, turn around and wait for him or wait for the guy to catch up with him and then move on together again. The problem is with Vai, he doesn't turn around - he  just moves on to the next project without looking back at you to see if you get it and you wonder if he cares. Now, there is some burning and imaginative guitar work on this CD. Firewall is a great barn-burning power song even if you wish someone else were handling vocals. Building the Church is a great instrumental that is wonderfully constructed and could become a Vai classic.  The rest is esoteric and you have to have a tremendous amount of patience for it. On the next album, Steve, please turn around and see if your fans are keeping up with you, otherwise you may lose a few.
B00008BXJG|5.0|If you are new to AC/DC, by all means, buy this album!  It is the perfect starting point.  A few months back I bought Fly on the Wall, which is pretty good, but if you want to hear what AC/DC is all about, pick up Highway to Hell immediatly!
074322454X|5.0|Ambose has a way with telling a story, weaving together different people's pieces of a story into a tale worth listening to. This book is no different. This was the first Ambrose book on WWII that I had read and it was quickly followed by \\"Citizen Soldiers\\", \\"D-Day: June 6, 1944\\" and \\"Pegasus Bridge\\"...needless to say, I enjoy Ambrose's writing style and technique. <br /> <br />To me one of the most interesting aspects of the subject is the subject matter...the 101st served in nearly every aspect of the US' involvement of WWII in the European theater...D-Day, The Battle of the Bulge, Operation Market Garden, etc.  As such, the reader gets an introduction to many different aspects of the war in this area of the world. <br /> <br />If you have read any other Ambrose work, then you will enjoy this book.  If you've never read any of his books, then this is the best one of his many works to start with as I feel it's the best of his WWII books.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Once upon a time in the world of science fiction, there was only one Star Trek.  No Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine.... Just an often-repeated tv series watched by devoted fans.  Then someone had the wonderful idea of applying modern special effects to this old story.  Hey, what could we do with the original crew and wonderful story, but instead of plastic models on strings being dragged across a star-studded screen, using modern cinematography and music on a cinema screen. <br />Great idea!  But in the excitement of exploring these new effects, the fundamental story was forgotten. Special Effects are cool but not what made Star Trek popular in the first place. It was the characters and the intricate universe that they explored.   STTMP has lengthy scenes exploring the exterior of the new Enterprise and the alien space cloud all displaying the latest in special effects (at that time) and with a lovely musical score.  But these scenes drag on..and on, and the excitement of the plot is lost <br />Now please do not mistake me.  I am a long term fan of Star Trek and I am a happy owner of this movie.  It is a worthwhile re-introduction to beloved characters, but that is all.  IMO this is the weakest of the Star Trek movies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How FOX could have canceled this show, and replace it with \\"Skating With Celebrities\\", \\"Nanny 911\\", and \\"Trading Spouses\\" is unbelievable and pure stupidity.  This is by far the best show on television (besides \\"24\\") in years.   <br /> <br />If FOX was smart enough to bring back \\"Family Guy\\" after prematurely canceling it the first time, maybe, just maybe, there might be help for \\"Firefly\\"...one can only hope.
B00008EY65|3.0|Good story if you can get past the crappy beginning.  The FX are awesome in most scenes and then seem trivial and pathetic in others.  Don't get me wrong, overall I liked the movie.  A great comic adaptation, but the average viewier is going to be picking this thing apart.  Okay...you like comics??? RENT, do not buy this movie.  After you see what it offers, make your buying decision.  Personally, the dialogue and creaive charaters (except the main crappy villian) kept me interested enough to RENT a sequel.  It's sad that SO MUCH good movie was damaged by bits and pieces of bad...Still, worth the rental.
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator is one of the best albums of the Synth genre. Already known for their previous album, \\"Music for the Masses\\", popularity was easily accessible for this band. For many that grew up in the 90's, like myself, this album introduced us to DM. Increasing popularity with the Dance genre. Though this is the most popular album, do not let it's popularity ruin buying this album.  <br /> <br />The signature hypnotic sound of Depeche Mode, with Gore's vague but frightenly deep lyrics, Gahan's voice soaring through most of the album, and an overall minimalistic way that is DM.  <br /> <br />Opening the album with World in My Eyes, the catchy bass lines and the overall smooth flavor of the song keeps you addicted, just as the sexuality referenced in the lyrics. <br />Following the fast paced track, Sweetest Perfection slows down with Gore's voice blending well with the music.  <br />Things swing back up to the bluesy atmosphere of one of their most popular songs of all time:  Personal Jesus. Heaviest guitar influences of the album, as with the catchy hook, \\"Reach Out, Touch Faith\\", makes you want to have your own Personal Jesus.  <br /> <br />Halo reminds me of some of their earlier songs, but still wonderful none the less. \\"Waiting for The Night\\" is a very gentle, tranquil song, with ambient tones. After such gentleness, the ambient nature shoots up with Enjoy the Silence. Very dancable, and beautifully created, still considered their best song.  <br /> <br />After settling down from the Biggest Hit, the album settles down with Policy of Truth, another catchy tune, though wonderful in it's own right, has to follow Enjoy the Silence. Blue Dress is another slow song sung by Gore. Simple and gentle. The final out of the nine is Clean, closes the album well, with the dark melodies and  the echoes that leaves you wanting more. This song needs to be listened more to enjoy. <br /> <br />Granted, this album is not for everyone, but is great to get into DM. Some of the dark overtones that is DM may take a while at first, but once hooked, its hard to shake off.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is so good that in my opinion it ranks up amoung animated classics such as The Lion King, Beauty and The Beast, and Cinderella it will leave you with a huge smile on your face for as many times as you see it
B0007OCG4W|3.0|How much did Julia Roberts get to use such filth? I went with my mom and my sister and well i have to say i was enbarassed to say the least a lot of the conversation did not fit the scenero, and I felt it was a waste of a good actor Clive Owen, and I think Jude Law who i think is a great actor was miscast. The real \\"movie star\\" here no doubt Natalie Portman. I would rent it before actually purchasing it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|It seems to me that every harry potter movie and book is the same story with just different enemys an different dumb british remarks to make the entire country look dumb yet in every potter story you always have a little smile on with harrys triumph
B00005JMJG|3.0|I think the only good thing about this film was the score. The soundtrack is worth the purchase, but i felt the film lacked depth, and you never could get into any of the feeling of emotion that the charcters protrayed.  I knowa lot of people liked it my teenage daughter did and well even the title turned me off.  It was just a day to kill some time we went to see it. I would rent then think if you really wanted to purhcase it. A waste of a good actress Winslett.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I lived in the East Village in the late 80s and spent a lot of time at memorial services for friends who died from AIDS.  The movie Rent completely floored me.  I cried so much I couldn't leave the theatre afterward.  It did a great job of capturing the sadness and beauty of that time. <br /> <br />There's only us, there's only this...
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I left the theatre in tears, it was such a beautiful film that captures the mind and the spirit of make believe.  Depp was the true star that captured the fantasy of Peter Pan.  It was simply magical.
B00020HEG6|5.0|It's my personal opinion that the scores of Harry Potter have been going up in quality and, more importantly, magic.  John Williams created his best Harry Potter score ever.<br /><br />In spite that some of the familiar themes are missing in the movie, -and, consequently, on the CD -Williams manages to create such a wonderful new voice to Harry Potter.  Hedwig's theme is definitely heard in here.  Besides, we have an interesting variety of rhythms this time around: there is jazz on 'The Knight Bus', and waltz on 'Aunt Marge's Waltz'; and those are the funniest tracks of the score.  Of course, since this is a Williams work, there are spectacular musical moments as evidenced in tracks like 'Buckbeak's Flight', 'Quidditch, Third Year', and 'Lupin's Transformation And Chasing Scabbers'.  And I don't want to forget 'A Window To The Past', which is a tender piece that appears when Harry remembers his parents; such a beautiful track.<br /><br />This is a great album that truly proves that John Williams, like Harry Potter, still has got the magic to create such fantastic work.
B0000256VK|5.0|if you know what I mean.  I'm sorry, but I can't put it any more bluntly than that.  This is a very romantic album by a talented group at the very height of their powers, aided by a producer (Rhett Davies) who was also at the apex of his career.  Too bad that everyone involved in this project had to break up soon after it was made.  This is just an amazing album by a lot of people who were, at the time, squarely on their game.  And it's a true time-tested complement to the act of \\"making the beast with two backs\\". <br /> <br />Just about every song on this album is a masterpiece of love and longing, best of all of which is the classic \\"More Than This\\" (featured prominently in the film 'Lost in Translation').  This album is just terrific in almost every way.  Even the most pathetic nerdy dude in the world will attract a desirable female with this album spinning loudly on his CD player.  It's worked for me.  Many times. <br /> <br />
B000001EKX|5.0|After the poor reception and slow sales of Kiss' first album, the record company ordered them to return to the studio just a few months after the first album was released to create another album.  The result was one of the best albums of their career, even though the production is a bit shoddy.    1. Got To Choose-5/5.  Excellent Paul song that wasn't performed much after the Alive album.  The lyrics are really cool and the vocals are excellent.  Very heavy song.  2. Parasite-5/5.  Another song written by Ace and sung by Gene.  This has a classic heavy metal riff with great lyrics and plenty of attitude.   3. Goin' Blind-5/5.  Great song by Gene with excellent music and vocals.  The lyrics aren't great but they aren't terrible either.  The most appealing thing about this song is the music.  It is very unique.  4. Hotter Than Hell-5/5.  This song is where the bad production shows up more than on any other.  The song itself is great.  Very heavy riff, great lyrics and vocals by Paul.  One of their best.  5. Let Me Go, Rock and Roll-5/5.  Very upbeat, fast tempo song written by Paul and Gene and sung by Gene.  The lyrics are very rock and roll type lyrics.  The chorus is very catchy.  A great song.  6. All the Way-4/5.  Another heavy song by Gene.  The vocals are great, the music is cool, but the chorus is lacking a bit, making this a 4 instead of a 5.  Still great, though.  7. Watchin' You-5/5.  One of my personal favorite Kiss songs.  The lyrics and vocals are really cool and the riff is awesome.  Heavy metal at its best.  8. Mainline-4/5.  Written by Paul and sung by Peter, this is a great song, but is very different for Kiss. It doesn't have the heavy riffs that most Kiss songs have and the chorus has a more rock and less metal feel to it.  9. Comin' Home-4/5.  This is another example of how bad the production on this album is.  The vocals sound rough. The music is cool but it is too distorted and there is way too much bottom end.  This song would have been much better if the production would have been better.  10. Strange Ways-5/5.  Very heavy song from Ace and sung by Peter.  The riff is super heavy.  Slow tempo gives it a monster metal feel to it.  One of the best songs from Ace.    This album would have been near perfect if the production would have been much better.  Although the band says that they were rushed for songs on this one and \\"Dressed To Kill\\", the songs themselves would never show it.  They are among the best in Kiss' history.  This album is a must for every Kiss fan, but may not be for casual fans.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|Pop up a sex pack of Pabst or Old Milwaukee, strike up a camel and enjoy the show!!!<br /><br />  Mainly acoustical, with harminica emphasis (think Dylan with a kick arse back-up band).<br /><br />  \\"Sympatheitc Noose\\" is the best, by far -- have that on repeat to catch every note and lyric.<br /><br />  You will want to sing along and grab a harmonica to keep up.  Excellent dinner music, even better if you are on the back porch having a BBQ.<br /><br />  FIRE IT UP!!!!
B000BHHVPO|4.0|Hey guys, <br />I'm confused. Best Buy was showing Coldplay's set from Live 8 on their Big Screen, Hi-Def TVs the other day and the picture and sound were amazing. The picture, in particular, really jumped out at me. It was crystal-clear. Is Best Buy's in-store feed showing the Live 8 DVD? If so, the quality of the Live 8 DVD  is brilliant, but I continue to read reviews below that complain about the DVD's visual qualities.  <br />As for the sets, Coldplay, U2, Pink Floyd, The Killers and The Who were awesome! But I still have questions/concerns about the DVD's quality. Somebody help. Thanks.
B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie was absolutely ridiculous, if I could have given it a negative star I would have. I can not see how people sit through it. I tried to watch it once and it was so stupid I couldn't even do it. I finally forced myself to sit through it and it was even stupider than I originally thought it would be. I don't know what kind of people like this movie but I'm not one of them... Rent it first before you decide to buy it!!!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Everyone Poops does an excellent job of explaining a subject to children that many adults may be uncomfortable talking about without the help of this humorous, well-illustrated book. The book does not cross into the area of bad taste or black humor, but is a funny, practical guide to helping children understand the subject. On a lighter note, no college dormitory or fraternity house living room should be without their very own copy of Everyone Poops!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I did not see the TV shows that this movie is based upon, however, I understood everything that was going on.  The fast pacing, storyline, special effects, and interplay of characters were really  good, and what you wished Episodes I-III of Star Wars would've been (though I liked IV to VI).  The amazing thing about this film is that it cost ~$40? mil to make which really puts a lot of the more expensive special effects films to shame.  Some of the scenes really could illicit a visceral reaction, which is so hard to get from Hollywood these days... even the jokes were funny.  I might add that I'm a bit jaded when it comes to watching movies these days, so when I like a film, it had to have done something incredibly well.<br /><br />This was a worthwhile rental and even a purchase if you like owning SCi-Fi DVDs.
B000BVD460|4.0|For young children, this book is a great resource towards their learning about, well.... poop. As a child psychologist, I realize that only through teaching youngsters about such a socially inappropriate topic will they stop joking about it during class, lunch and at home.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains are without a doubt the BEST grunge band ever, and they also one of my favorite bands as well. Their first album \\"Facelift\\" was a great album, and a classic too, but their second album \\"Dirt\\" is the best Alice in Chains album. No words can describe how much I praise this album. Every song on here is a classic. Sean Kinney has nice drums on here. Michael Starr's bass lines are so awesomely sick you can actually hear them. You've also got cool guitar riffs and nice solos from Jerry Cantrell (who also plays accoustic guitar really good), and of course the ever so powerful yet emotional vocals from the late great Layne Staley.<br /><br />The Songs:<br /><br />1. Them Bones - Good opening song. Nice solo from Cantrell. 5/5<br /><br />2. Dam That River - One of my favorites on here. The chorus is just addicting, I love it. 5/5<br /><br />3. Rain When I Die - My Favorite song. Not a single word can describe how much I love this song. 5/5<br /><br />4. Down In A Hole - Another one of my favorites songs. 5/5<br /><br />5. Sickman - 5/5<br /><br />6. Rooster - Another great song. An ode to Jerry's father. 5/5<br /><br />7. Junkhead - 5/5<br /><br />8. Dirt - excellent title cut. 5/5<br /><br />9. Godsmack - Great song, I really like this one. 5/5<br /><br />10. untitled - 4/5<br /><br />11. Hate To Feel - 5/5<br /><br />12. Angry Chair - 5/5<br /><br />13. Would - a nice album closer. I really like this one too. 5/5<br /><br />Well there you have it, a must have for any Alice In Chains fan. Buy this masterpiece now.<br /><br />REST IN PEACE LAYNE STALEY!!
B000AP04FG|3.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith (the  \\"Mrs.\\" clearly is intentional as opposed to \\"Ms.\\") is a fun spoof of the \\"What?  You mean we are both secret assassins and we've been married for 6 years (or 5, as Mr. Smith thinks), and we never even had a clue?\\" genre.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are great in their roles as assassins in their day jobs, and dull domestic partners in the evening.  The highlight off this movie is the fight scene in their home, when they've come to the somewhat misguided conclusion that the only way out of the mess of working for two opposing agencies is to take out the other.  Lots of firepower and broken glass here.  The neighbors even notice!<br /><br />The worse part is toward the end (not telling you how it will end, of course).  Mr. and Mrs. Smith's bullets miraculously hit every time; miraculously since their opponents are wearing total body armor.  In the meantime, their opponents always, always miss.  The grim expressions on Brad and Angelina's faces, along with lots of paint cans exploding and two fisted shooting, don't cover up this glaring inconsistency.  They weren't this accurate when they were shooting at each other!  Perhaps that is because they really didn't want to cause violence to the other... except for the head butts, kicking, and punching.<br /><br />You know, there was a lot of violence in this movie!<br /><br />See it once to observe the chemistry that got Brad and Angelina together (their first child together was announced this week).  Then you can move on to other entertainment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Okay this album makes you think. Sort of. I often find myself thinking about this album when I'm not listening to it trying to figure out some lyric that Yorke blurted out on one of these songs. <br />I don't know why I just said that, but I did. <br />Classic album, I don't really know what else to say. <br />Now, Dear MTV Supporter- <br />I'm glad you think a song can only be as good as the chorus.  If you knew you wouldn't like this album before you bought it (or whatever you did), then why did you 'waste your time' listening to it? Yes, I read your other reviews and I can understand why you don't like Radiohead (He's a Good Charlotte, 50 Cent fan folks!).  so maybe I just don't understand or something but it just doesn't make sense why \\"The Young and the Hopeless\\", and \\"Get Rich of Die Trying\\" got 5 stars, and not Ok Computer. Oh wait, I guess I do understand. It's because those songs have \\"catchy chourses\\".
B0000024W3|3.0|I am amazed to see reviewers give this double-LP/single CD more than three stars as it is frankly a good but certainly not a great album. The original material is simply too thin here, and the covers are less interesting than say the ones he did with George Harrison et al in the famous 1970 session available on bootlegs. There are some great moments, such as 'Days of 49', 'Minstral Boy', 'Quinn the Eskimo' (both done with The Band), and 'Alberta #2'. But there are also quite a few stinkers and half-baked outcomes: 'I Forgot More', 'Blue Moon', 'The Boxer', and 'It Hurts Me Too' (the latter of which he shamefully claims composer credit). Perhaps the best thing about the album is its title, which always poses the conundrum: is this the real Dylan, a true self-portrait, or just another mask?
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I never wanted to see this movie. I remember my mother watching TV one day a long time ago and the OBC was singing \\"Seasons of Love\\". My sister wanted me to see it as she is a lesbian. It just didn't strike me as what I would like, even though I adore broadway.  <br /> <br />My friend then dragged me to the movie theatre the day after RENT opened. I sat there, irritated, but decided to have an open mind. Wow. This movie is phoenominal, for lack of a better word. The characters were people you could relate to with the issues of surviving in the world: AIDS, paying the rent, drugs, just to name a few. I'm a senior in high school, and with going into the world soon, I have a better understanding of some problems people face thanks to this movie. <br /> <br />This movie, however, does deal with homosexuality, which did cause some uproar in theatres I went to seeing the movie five times. If you do not have an open mind, stay far away from this movie. It also deals with death, drug use, and some sexuality, so beware when showing it to a younger audience.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I rented this movie because I had heard and read random good things about it. I wasn't expecting much, but I have to say I really enjoyed it. Once you realize it's not a horror movie, but rather a reflective and philosophical one, it gets very enjoyable. If you like this movie, I'd also recommend The Butterfly Effect.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At the time I am writing this review, over 2000 other reviewers have given this series 5 stars.  It was based on this tremendous possitive feedback that I went out and bought the series myself, never having seen it (or the movie).  I now see why everyone has given this show such good reviews.  The creators of Firfly have combined sharp writing with very good acting and an amazing story.  The basic premis has been done over and over ... sci fi western (e.g., Star Wars).  But the fresh spin and great character development make this a great series.  Great shows are not always about originality.  If a retread is told in a manner that fires the imagination it can just as powerful. <br /> <br />What bogles my mind, is how FOX could completely drop the ball on this.  Unless there were major problems with the actors not getting along (of which there is no evidence) or unless the writers were getting bored with the idea (which is unlikely given its short run) this show should have been around for at least 5-6 years.  Instead FOX is now bringing us such classics as Skating with the Stars.  Good job guys. <br /> <br />My hope was that the Sci Fi Channel would pick this show up, but other than viewing repeats I have not yet heard of any new production planned.  So, I will add my voice to the hurricane of great reviews and highly recommend this series and the movie.

B000A7DVY0|5.0|To me, the greatest thing about the Coen brothers is how vastly different each of their films is.  For example, after making the dark, dramatic \\"Fargo\\", they made this film - \\"The Big Lebowski\\", a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen.  What other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film, and continuing doing so through all of their films?  Only the Coen brothers.    \\"The Big Lebowski\\" stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed man known to everyone as \\"The Dude\\".  His life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman), the latter of which is an easily upset Vietnam vet.  Life is good for The Dude - until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug, mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski.  The Dude goes to visit \\"the Big Lebowski\\" (David Huddleston) and tells him about it.  Shortly thereafter, The Dude is beat up by three people he's never met, then ordered by the Big Lebowski to be the courier in an exchange - the Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (a young Tara Reid) has just been kidnapped.  From there on, things get worse and worse for The Dude.  How he's gonna get himself out of it is anyone's guess.    \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is really a fantastic film.  There is a well-written, clever, and funny script - which isn't really a surprise from the Coen brothers.  Great directing and cinematography (the latter by Roger Deakins), particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences.  There's also a really cool soundtrack, featuring Bob Dylan, CCR, and more.    But what would the film be without the cast?  Jeff Bridges is really great and funny as The Dude.  The real highlight of the cast is probably John Goodman, who is absolutely hilarious as The Dude's over-the-top best friend.  There's also good performances from Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Sam Elliott.  Coen brothers favorites Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Peter Stormmare also appear.As I've said, the thing that is most appealing about the Coen brothers are the differences between each of their films.  \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is one of their very best.  It's a stoner movie - and it's one of the best movies ever made.  Watch it, dude.  You won't regret it.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age have to be one of the most rhythmic bands I have ever heard. Still, it may be a little hard to truly become a fan because, well, to say that the band follows a revolving door concept would be an understatement. Not only has there been a different lineup on each album, but there even seems to be a different lineup on each performance the band does; compare the lineup on this album to the lineup they had when they performed on Saturday Night Live last May. (And speaking of SNL, I hope newbies don't use those performances as an accurate representation of the band, because it sounded like someone forgot to do sound check.)<br /><br />Anyway, as other reviewers have mentioned, this album not only has a more stripped-down approach than their previous albums, but several of the songs are also about relationships. Fortunately, this method works, as evidenced by standouts like \\"The Blood Is Love\\", \\"Broken Box\\" and my favorite song, \\"In My Head\\".  The leadoff single \\"Little Sister\\" is also good.<br /><br />There are also a couple funky tracks that are hard to skip by. \\"You Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\" seems to ride a hip-hop-inspired beat, and the music to \\"Burn the Witch\\" is reminiscent of \\"No One Knows\\" without sounding redundant. But I do think \\"Someone's In the Wolf\\" would have been better had it been strictly an instrumental.<br /><br />I'm not sure how long this incarnation of the Queens will last (except Josh, that is), but they still molded Lullabies to Paralyze into a great listen. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S. In response to another reviewer, there's no such song on here called \\"Like a Drug\\".

Do yourself a favor, Grisham fan or not, and read this next November!

B00005JOQ9|3.0|\\"Hostel\\" is the story of two young American guys backpacking through Europe on a summer adventure. They, along with an Icelandic friend, decide to head to Bratislava, Slovakia after being told it was a great place to find hot girls and wild sex. They meet up with two young women, a Russian and a Czech, and then proceed to do the obvious - party and have sex. But the next day their friend from Iceland turns up missing and then their drinks are spiked by the girls. From there the movie changes gears from sexy, youthful adventure to brutal tortue and murder, apparently masterminded by a creepy European guy they had previously met on the train. The movie differs from many of the classic horror films in that the killers don't have a seemingly supernatural ability to escape death like Jason or Michael Myers. But rather they are \\"normal\\" human beings with a twisted, sadistic desire to seek their thrills by torture and murder. <br /> <br />Those expecting something with serious artistic intention because of Quentin Tarantino's name being attached to it will probably be disppointed. Eli Roth is actually the director and writer of this film and his intention seems basically to scare the hell out of you. Does he succeed? Well, for me, not so much. The torture scenes are quite gruesome. But the movie relys mainly on blood and guts gore rather than suspense. Personally, I never really felt scared. The movie also employs a plot device very similar to \\"Friday the 13th\\" and tons of other films in the horror genre - the victims are lured into dangerous circumstances by first succumbing to sexual temptation. This movie differs from many, however, in that not only does the main character manage to escape. But he also proceeds to inflict some very brutal revenge on his tormenters. This \\"eye for eye\\" series of actions makes up the movie's finale. I must say that I found the insistence of the \\"good guy\\" to exact revenge a disturbing way to end the film. But this is a horror movie, afterall, and you probably shouldn't come if you don't want to leave feeling disturbed.

The cinematography is superb, so much so that you forget you are in a theater watching it.

0375501851|4.0|This was Smith's blockbuster first novel, though I didn't read it until after her rather more polished third one. It's about what it means to be English, but to the Britain-born and to immigrants from the ex-Empire, in this case Jamaica and Bangladesh. It's 1974 and Archie Jones, middle-aged white Londoner and not the sharpest tack in the box but a good man, meets 19-year-old Clara Bowden, black beauty with no upper teeth who has to escape from her Jehovah's Witness mother. At the same time, Samad Iqbal, a semi-lapsed but anguished Muslim and Archie's mate from the last months of World War II, is married off to the young but feisty Alsana Begum. Archie and Clara's daughter, Irie, and the Iqbals' twin boys, Magid and Millat, thus begin a complicated interweaving that stretches until the mid-1990s (and later), while the author shows and explains and relates and expounds and examines, and the reader goes along for a fascinating ride. There's a lot of pointed humor here -- Smith doesn't let any person or group off the hook -- but also a good deal of serious thought about culture and acculturation, about what people need from each other. This is an impressive first novel. Smith was only twenty-four when it was published and that makes it even more impressive. I hope she continues writing far into the future.

B000002S4R|3.0|Source: Studio recording.  From the fact that it was recorded partly in December 1981 in Berlin, then in March 1982 in Salzburg, and finally in September 1983, back in Berlin again, it appears that this \\"Dutchman\\" had a difficult or perhaps stormy birth.<br /><br />Sound: 1980s digital stereo.  The recorded sound is clear and crisp, as might be expected.  Purely as a matter of personal taste, I think it provides an over-reverberant soundscape for the voices.<br /><br />Cast: Der Hollaender - Jose Van Dam; Daland - Kurt Moll; Senta - Dunja Vejzovic; Erik - Peter Hofmann; Der Steuermann - Thomas Moser; Mary - Kaja Borris.  Conductor: Herbert von Karajan with the Berliner Philharmoniker and the Konzertvereinigung Wiener Staatsopernchor.<br /><br />Format: Disk 1: Overture, Act I, tracks 2-6; Act II, tracks 7-8;76:29.  Disk 2: Act II (continued), tracks 1-7; Act III, tracks 8-12; 69:43.<br /><br />Text: This performance uses the standard text, which is essentially the three-act version performed for King Ludwig II in Munich, December 1864.<br /><br />First off, let me speak to the committed Karajan fans.  This is Herr Doktor von K in the 1980s.  He's become a little slower but he's still fully himself, and he's conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.  That is worth five stars to you.  Now, go away while I explain to everyone else why this recording is mediocre.<br /><br />The prime and true begetter of the problems with this recording is Herbert von Karajan.  At this stage of his career, he seems to have concluded that Wagner wrote long symphonies with vocal lines of relatively minor interest.  Since Wagner, when he finally got everything under his own control, famously hid his orchestra away in a covered pit, it would appear that the composer held a different opinion from that of the conductor.<br /><br />Karajan, whose prestige and authority were such that he could and should have had the finest singers in the world, settled for a cast of no great distinction.  They are not bad, mind you, but fifty years from now, nobody--nobody--will be recalling them as luminaries of a golden age of Wagnerian singing.<br /><br />The best of the bunch are confined to supporting roles.  Kurt Moll serves as the cast's distinguished old pro as Daland--not a part, unfortunately, to carry the opera.  Thomas Moser, in the tiny part of the Steersman, actually shows some hints of liveliness before he effectively disappears.  Peter Hoffman as Erik certainly looked like a Wagnerian hero.  Throughout his career he was a magnet for reviews that started off by saying, \\"He was not Vickers (or not Windgassen, or not Whoever) but he was all right.\\"  Well, on this recording he isn't a particularly memorable Wagnerian tenor, but he is all right--if you don't mind a little straining here and there.  Dunja Vejzovic, as Senta, offers a perfect match for Hofmann, alas.  Then there is Jose Van Dam, upon whose shoulders the opera must ride.  He gives a good, solid, unobjectionable performance that is utterly devoid of the magic and mystery that is the very nature of the Dutchman.  He sings pleasingly enough, no question of that, but when he is finished, his Dutchman is instantly forgettable.<br /><br />Such, then, is the cast, but Karajan has given us more, a true double-whammy, for he seldom allows us to hear them.  The recording is balanced to ensure that every time the orchestra swells in volume it utterly overwhelms the singers, something that could only have happened by the specific direction of the all-powerful conductor.  Among other consequences, this has the strange effect of turning the lightly-accompanied, Gilbert and Sullivanesque spinning chorus at the beginning of Act II into one of the most impressive vocal displays in the opera.  That is very nice for the Chorus of the Vienna State Opera--a superb body of singers, I hasten to state--but, I think, hardly Wagner's intention.<br /><br />There you have it.  If you are a Karajan groupie, if you love great choral singing, if you wish to be impressed by the brilliant Berlin Philharmonic at their best, this is \\"Der fliegende Hollaender\\" for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  There are a lot of good Dutchmen sailing the recorded seas, both modern and historic.at their best, this is \\"Der fliegende Hollaender\\" for you.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|\\"Blade\\" is back. Whistler is back. And while vampires still suck, this sequel doesn't. (insert groan here)<br /><br />Blade (Wesley Snipes), a half-vampire with a hatred toward the 'vampire nation' that created him, is recruited by the very same people he has vowed to destroy. New monsters called Reapers have surfaced, each bent on killing not only humans but vampires as well. Blade takes command of the all-vampire Blood Pack, a team of assassins originally being trained to kill Blade himself, and sets out take down the Reapers. While Blade knows that he will be shown forbidden secrets of the vampire nation in order to track down the Reapers to their lair, he is also very aware that those he leads will turn on him first chance they get.<br /><br />Director Guillermo del Toro must have a thing for mutated, once-human monsters, so it's easy to see that a vampire film would be a natural attraction. While taking the reigns from \\"Blade\\" director Stephen Norrington and bringing Blade's creator Marv Wolfman onboard, this sequel to the 1998 hit takes everything from the original and cranks it up a notch. The fights are more superhuman than before, the attitudes are even bigger, and the vampire-killing violence is gratuitous a-plenty. Del Toro appears to have understood everything that made the original surprise hit work, and Wesley Snipes (also wearing the producers hat with his own Amen Ra Films) wouldn't have let him get very far if he didn't.<br /><br />Not since \\"The Matrix\\" has a film come so close to looking like a live-action comic book. Wesley Snipes' portrayal of the title character has been improved by incorporating computer imagery to make him appear to jump higher, hit faster, and fall harder, all the while avoiding the 'wire fu' combat that the aforementioned \\"Matrix\\" has made standard in recent action films. Since the effect works and serves the story well, the kind of battle scenes that needed for future theatrical stories such as \\"The Death of Superman\\" and \\"The Hulk\\" seem like less of an undertaking. To maximize the effect, the virtual camera is able to show the action everywhere, as if the audience, too, were jumping, swinging, or in free-fall.<br /><br />The worst offense that \\"Blade II' commits may be lost opportunity. Leonor Varela (as Nyssa) seemed to have had a lot more story behind her character and her interest in Blade (and his interest in her) is left mostly unexplored; it feels like something might have been left on the cutting room floor. Donnie Yen (as Snowman) gets almost no chance to show off his considerable fighting skills. Even Kris Kristofferson's Whistler, while stealing some of the best lines in the film, doesn't get much screen time either (although getting him back into the story after his 'death' in the original film is both clever and important to the plot.) Fortunately, either you like this kind of film or you don't; if you're among the ones who do, there isn't much time to think about what isn't there while you're grinning from ear to ear.<br /><br />A word of caution: there are a few horribly realistic scenes of vampire dissection, and they look as realistic as any battle damage shown in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Otherwise, look for Ron Perlman (as Rienhardt) at his best as Blade's main rival from the Blood Pack, and Luke Goss (as Nomak) playing the head Reaper as evil as they come. Between action, gunplay, fights, chases, special effects, and offensive one-liners, \\"Blade II\\" pleases on all levels.

B0000028RR|5.0|I'm sorry this review is for all the ignorant RATM haters out there...and you need to get your facts straight. First of all, RATM is not some cheap knock-off of Linkin Park. RATM's first debut album hit stores in the early 90's; while Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" didn't debut until about 2000. And not to state this offensively but, it is ignorant to think RATM copied their material from any other band. Yes, the penatonic-funk genre had already presented itself to the public, however, Tom Morello took the penatonic idea and creavitely constructed to his own funk-rythem. Yes, they sound similar to several bands; but that is common in the general rock genre. RATM is also not a hypocritical conformist band either. If any of you actually knew anything about the band you would know that Zach de la Rocha's father was involved in politics. Yes, their ideas are a little extreme, but the whole purpose of the band is to share their ideas with the public by telling them about what democracy and freedom should be about; the (voice of the people). If any of ever did any research you would also know that RATM were activists of their time and some former band members still play a part in the fight for the people's rights, (they are not hypocrites). Please, if don't like the band, so be it, but don't post inaccurate information about what you think they are all about; instead try to research what they are really all about and then voice your opinion. BTW: age, sex, or even a degree in psycology doesn't make you right, when you voice an opinion. An opinion is what you think; it's not factual evidence.---But this album has to be their best work. Their ideas were brilliant; Zach de la Rocha rap/heavymetal-political lyrics combined with Tom Morello's genius licks and rythmic bass lines and drums beats give the band the compeling edge, but completely misunderstood in its generation. I completely idolize all their music and believe their unique make them one of the most brilliant, creative bands of all time. I give them 10/5 stars for RATM
0684803356|5.0|Someone should rush into George W Bush's office with a copy of this book.  It's not anti-war, but it is about what Wilfird Owen called 'the pity of war', the terrible ironic waste of camaraderie and love and stories and landscapes, and the value of the life of just one man.   <br /> <br />So many reviews summarise the plot, so I'll refrain.  It's almost like Hamlet, though; Robert Jordan has to blow a bridge, but four acts go by before he acts.  In that space, he and we learn what the act will really mean - nothing, in terms fo the war, but everything to him.  he's like a matador, int eh pause between the bull's turn and his impact.  The whole book is lit up with Robert's mortality.   <br /> <br />And it sounds amazing, lyrical, not entirely spare, but with half-heard rhythms as steady as pulses. <br /> <br />I liked Maria.  I know I'm swimming against the feminist stream, but why not goodness in a heroine instead of the tiresome feistiness we've all seen so much of lately?   <br /> <br />Pilar, however, is not tiresome, and to meet her is alone enough to put this book at the top of any list of tO read books you may be making.  She shines because it is SHE whoo is Hemingway - yes, folks, he was fat and a bit food-obssessed.  And she is the storyteller.  Hemingway was interested in that kind of transgression - read Garden of Eden.  But read this first. <br />

0679409874|5.0|Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.<br /><br />The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.<br /><br />SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.<br /><br />This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.<br /><br />Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmannlmost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

B000002H97|5.0|This was the end of the 11-year phenomenon known as Metallica. This is the last real Metallica album. (Load and Re-Load came after) I'm not saying Load and Re-Load were bad, it's just not Metallica. I'm not saying that St. Anger is horrible either, but a Metallica album with no solos? Count me out, and what happened to Hetfield's voice!? Anywho, I'm here for The Black Album, not my ranting on why I don't like St. Anger. Here we go! <br /> <br />Enter Sandman 5/5: The trademark of Metallica is a kick-ass first track, with an accoustic intro of course. This could easily be the best song on the album. (Not ever, One holds that title.) They play it at every show, it's a single, and everyone in the world thinks it's the only good song on TBA! I beg to differ. It even has the trademark \\"Now I lay me down to sleep\\" prayer in the middle, pretty haunting, eh? <br /> <br />Sad But True 5/5: Another trademark of Metallica is a beat that stops, then starts again. (Stop/Start) The final part of the song makes me headbang crazily. <br /> <br />Holier Than Thou 5/5: The fastest song on the album, the last glimpse of the crazy fast Thrash Metal Metallica does. What's not to love? <br /> <br />The Unforgiven 5/5: Genius, simply genius. Track four is for the fourth time, a ballad. Although, they switch things up a bit! The Verses are heavy, and the chorus is soft. Pure genius. <br /> <br />Wherever I May Roam 5/5: Best song on the album, once again, track five is my favorite. That \\"dun\\" is a 12-string bass note, courtesy of Jason Newsted. Perfect. <br /> <br />Don't Tread On Me 5/5: The intro sounds almost happy! but quickly gives way. Again, one of the last thrashy songs. <br /> <br />Through the Never 5/5: Thrashy, again, very, very fast. Not as fast as Holier Than Thou though. <br /> <br />Nothing Else Matters 5/5: The softest song on the album, not much to say about it! LOL :D <br /> <br />Of Wolf and Man 5/5: Cool song about werewolves. Very good. <br /> <br />The God That Failed 5/5: I really like this song. The guitar part is very fun to play. <br /> <br />My Friend of Misery 5/5: This could've been a wonderful instrumental. But, Lars decided lyrics needed to be in it. Oh Well. <br /> <br />The Struggle Within 5/5: Last glimpse of the metal we all love. Listen well ladies and gentlemen, the last song on the last real Metallica album. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is an excellent album, and deserves a spot in any Metallica fans CD shelf.  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000BTJDGC|3.0|There are some shots in this film that are stunning, horrifying in a novel way, without any gore or splatter. And the director achieves an eeriness, a tension in little things. <br /> <br />The acting is exceptional throughout. All the main characters are played with true intelligence behind their eyes. You can tell there is really someone home there. (In the case of Emily Rose, there may be more than one intelligence behind her eyes.)  <br /> <br />Campbell Scott, playing the prosecuting attorney, was a special surprise. I had been vaguely aware of him as a character actor in other films, but he comes into his own here. The DVD commentary identifies him as the son of actor George C. Scott. He performs his courtroom scenes with the same intensity his father was known for, but without any over-the-top tone of antagonsim. <br /> <br />However, I have several problems with the movie. I would have liked the DVD commentary to elaborate on just how much it is based on real events. But the commentary is silent and disappointing on this point - and so leads me to believe that any connection to a real person or real events must be tenuous at best. <br /> <br />But more crucially, I had a problem with the courtroom scenes. The battle lines seem to be falsely drawn. On the one side is the defendent, a priest being prosecuted for treating Emily Rose's condition with an exorcism rather than by referring her for further psychological help. On the other side is a loose consortium of psychologists who contend that is was criminal not to have continued treating Emily Rose for - perhaps schizophrenia, perhaps some manic-depressive disorder. <br /> <br />I don't believe this is even remotely the way any actual court case would have aligned. First of all, it seems much likelier that if any criminal charges were brought in such a case, they would have been brought against Emily Rose's parents for failure to get her continued, modern medical care. It would have been a charge similar to one that has been brought against Christian Scientist parents who have insisted that their children be treated only with prayer in instances where those children had some specific, operable medical conditions. That is what should have been at issue here. Did Emily Rose's parents have a right to maintain a strictly religious interpretation of Emily's symptoms? Does the State have a right to compel parents to submit their children to modern medical practice? <br /> <br />But even given the movie's premise that is was the priest who would be prosecuted - the only medical people arrayed against him were psychologists/psychoanalysts presenting the vague alternative that Emily had a mental problem. In the DVD commentary, the director does state that he was striving for an unspecified time frame for this movie. He wanted it to look as if it could have taken place anywhere from the 1970's to the present. Certainly though, the action takes place in recent decades. And some more strict medical explanations of Emily's condition would have been available.  <br /> <br />Oliver Sach's 'Awakenings' discovery would have been known. So the possibility that Emily had contracted some encephalitis sort of illness that led to catatonia, convulsions, and hallucinations could have been entertained. Or, enough might have been known about the genetic nature of Huntington's Disease to suggest that as a possibility for her illness. In Huntington's Disease, the severity of the illness and its time of onset depends upon how many repetitions of a certain sequence of nucleic bases exist in a gene on the victim's Chromosome 4. The more repetitions, the earlier and harder a person is hit with rigidity and hallucinations. <br /> <br />I don't say that either an encephalitis germ or a Huntington's gene would have been the answer to Emily's condition. I'm only saying that some such concrete medical explanation for such symptoms would have been advanced in recent decades. The possible explanations for such suffering would not have been limited to vague psychological diagnoses - 'maybe some sort of schizophrenia, maybe some sore of, ah, manic depression.' <br /> <br />So by failing to represent the real issues any court action brought in such a case would have revolved around - the whole movie loses credibility. I realize it would have been harder to maintain dramatic tension with the introduction of germ and DNA testimony. However I think it needed to be done. As things stand, this movie gives the Devil more than his due - and diminishes the possibility of Him in the process. <br /> <br />
0307276902|3.0|The news about the validity of James Frey's memoir just broke last week while I was halfway through the book.  I don't know all the details as to which parts were embellished, which parts were fabricated, and which are actual events.  It's surprising that anyone in his state of mind during detoxification could recall many details, and kind of embarrassing that anyone as perpetually intoxicated as him could have earned a college degree in the first place. <br /> <br />Fiction or not, two characteristics of the main character stand out, both related to his refusal to be subjugated by anyone else's rules.  The first is his adamant rejection of the AA process because of its basis on a higher power.  He refuses to admit that he is powerless against his addictions or subordinate to any form of God, which is apparently unconventional for recovering addicts.  James portrays himself as staunchly self-reliant as he battles the inner \\"Furies\\" that had fueled his self-destructive lifestyle.  The second characteristic is his negligence of the Clinic's rules regarding interactions between male and female patients, as manifested in his relationship with Lilly.  Their relationship evolved through nightly trysts, and their morbid hope of fighting their addictions together upon release keeps them together.  Did this help either of them?  Not sure, but it's one of the few parts of the story where James isn't completely self-absorbed.  Get ready to read a lot about how James doesn't give a damn as to what other people tell him. <br /> <br />The style of A Million Little Pieces is gripping at points, redundant at others.  The psychotic babble of a drug rehab clinic is not conducive to complete sentences and paragraphs, and Frey's style is totally appropriate at points.  However, the daily events are described in generic terms over and over again.  I get the point that his detoxification made him ill, and that his addictions provoke him into wanting \\"more more more\\" of everything.  And quite honestly, if he would eliminate the f-bomb and all its variants from the book, it would be 30-40 pages shorter.  Overall, I had difficultly empathizing with the main character, but he does gain perspective throughout the book, and that's what kept me reading.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|I found this to be an engrossing, eerie film. It is set in a place I didn't even know existed - Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Hudson River, just a short ski-lift-like \\"tram\\" ride from Manhattan proper. This location, so near and yet so far from the normal workaday world, sets the tone of the movie beautifully. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent throughout. Pete Postlethwaite is especially good as the building maintenance man - who may or may not be dangerous. Ariel Gade, the prescient little girl, really made the film for me though. She had an unusual core of wise adult quietude about her that gave her a sensitivity to her new atmosphere. She wasn't the average modern child, distracted with constant trivial wantings and whinings. So she brought a Victorian, 'Turn of the Screw' supernatural intensity to her role. <br /> <br />The most unrealistic element of the plot though was the behavior of Jennifer Connelly's attorney. He was actually available to her and sympathetic to her case. Where do you find lawyers like that? I can never even get my lawyer on the phone.
0596007124|5.0|If you want to know the easiest way to understand patterns based approach for software development, this does a perfect job. This book is very creative and entertaining in explaining the patterns. The book is inclined to Java for showing examples. If you did'nt buy GOF Patterns book, my suggestion is better start her for learning patterns. After reading this book, then you may choose to read technolgy specific patterns books like J2EE, .NET, Integration, Security, Web services. This books should've been available 8 years ago when I was cracking my head to understand why  should I know patterns. Worth reading and worth the buy.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The story, acting and character development is good enough to watch again and again.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000002LEU|5.0|When Substance came out it was the only way to get Warsaw-era material on disc, and this song list is a good start for someone just getting into the band, as well as a good representation of early 80s proto Goth/Industrial. If you're unwilling to plunk out the $60 for the boxed set (which is pretty much everything), this is the one to go for.
B00005JOII|2.0|So Woody Allen is currently fixated on Scarlett Johansson.  Oh Woody, you should be ashamed of yourself. Is it just me or is Johansson rapidly becoming the most overrated actress of her generation?<br /><br />First of all, Match Point is an overstylized standard adultery plot.  A couple of nice touches here and there and some good actors totally wasted. Non-actor Johansson really brought down the grading curve. She's terrible!  She was terrible in Ghost World and she was even worse in Lost in Translation. Sure, she may be maturing as a woman, but she sure needs acting lessons.<br /><br />Critics!  Stop reviewing Scarlett Johansson with organs other than your brains!<br /><br />Match Point is a bore.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Truly great directing of a great piece of literature. This is a wonderful love story in the harshest of circumstances, brought beautifully to life by director Ang Lee. This story is both moving and memorable. Thank you Ang Lee for bringing to the screen a most beautiful story filmed magnificently and thank you Annie Proulx for a truly great story.
B00005JOFO|5.0|BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a great movie. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall give great performances throughout the movie. The scenery in this movie is beautiful (filmed right here in Alberta). The movie is an emotional journey of two men who work together one summer herding sheep, and ultimately fall in love. They go on to live seperate lives and get married and have kids, but always come back to each other every year when they'd go to Brokeback Mountain. Michelle Williams is great, playing Ennis' (Ledger) wife. This is a great movie. I was really touched and moved by it.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I admit that Pat is one of those musicians that I stopped trying to understand decades ago. My main beef with this group over the years is that their creations pinpoint my musical taste exactly but then procede to devolve into either some type of goofy country bumpkin prairie music or new age trippiness. I have historically found the themes within their fusion to be too juxtaposed. IMHO jazz is a metropolitan style in which themes from \\"Little House on the Prairie\\", \\"Banaza\\", or \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" have no place.    In the case of this, their latest effort, I have to say they really pulled a rabit out their hat to coin a phrase. Listen to the other reviewers however when they tell you, \\"You won't catch on to this one after just one listen\\".  Fortunately, I had the patience to give this one several listens before passing judgement.  After the first go, I was certain that this one was destined for the RESALE heap. Boy was I ever wrong!    This is defininitely not the PMG I've grown to know and hate! After the first couple of listens I got the feeling that I had just sat through some sort of soundscape that was better suited for a multimedia presentation in an IMAX theatre. But then I started to catch the themes and the flow of the composition.  What I think I found IMHO is an anthology of many of the jazz influences of the past half century or so. Perhaps, \\"The Way Up\\" is refering to those other artists past and present from which Pat and the Group have drawn inspiration. If one listens closely one can pickout trace elements of artists like Miles Davis, Return to Forever, Weather Report, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Freddie Hubbard, the Stan Kenton Orchestra, Thad Jones & Mel Lewis' Big Band, Wes Montgomery and even Henry Mancini.      Also another delightful dimension to the music is the tasteful use counter-point (counter-melody) which gives the composition a sense of being arranged. Counter-point and arrangement are both elements that are woefully lacking in the music of this modern age.  These elements make the music feel as though it was meant to be a contemporary big band arrangement at times.    Then there is the secred instrument itself! I'm speaking of the guitar. Never let it be said that Pat Metheny is not an accomplished jazz improvisor. Pat can solo lick for lick with any jazz guitar legend that you care to name. Here he seems to have outdone even himself. His chief accomplishment, besides flawless clean guitar as well as synth guitar work as exhibited here, is the use of accoustic guitar without sounding like \\"Smooth Jazz Guitar\\". Nothing kills a jazz feel for me like the ricky-ticky acoustic guitar that is so prevalent in \\"Smooth Jazz\\". Thank you Pat for showing the Smooth Jazzniacs how accoustic guitar is supposed to be used on a Jazz album.    Any guitar player knows its all about tone baby! Well there's plenty of tone here. As a matter of fact there is a wealth of instrumental color exhibited by all parties. Vu makes the trumpet and flugal speak. And the composition is filled with some of the most interesting and, at times, melodic use of base guitar I've heard since the good old days. There is even the use of the bow on bass guitar to thunderous effect. Gone is the New Age like serenity that has been the trademark of the PMG of the past. This stuff spits fire at last! The only downside is that the drummer is still somewhat subdued and relegated to providing background ambience.      This is by far the best album by any jazz artist to come along in a long time. It's about time!  Definitely Grammy Material!
076780421X|3.0|I would not say tis is the best movie or great but it's good. The story is about a young American leaves Mexican photographer pregnant. She finds him a few months later just to let him know what happened. In the rush of the moment he follows her and they decide to get married. After that, a crash of customs and ideas develops in their families and in their relationship because of their different cultural and national backgrounds. At times the story is stupid and the acting is ok but there are funny moments. The thing that saves the movie is the chemistry between the two main charactors. Overall it's not a great movie but if your board and cant think of nothing to watch, watch this you'll be entertained.
B000AARKOO|1.0|Esta pelcula no es histrica bajo ningn punto de vista. Siempre se retrata a la Iglesia Catlica como una reunin de gente ambiciosa y sin escrpulos. Ciertamente no hay por qu exigir a una pelcula el rigor histrico de una investigacin profesional, tan slo que capture algo de su esencia y la muestre de modo novedoso. El reino de los cielos no logra ninguna de las dos cosas. Los hechos son tratados caprichosamente y cae en lo ya visto mil veces. La pelcula trata a Sybilla como una mujer bondadosa cuando en realidad envenen a su hermano (el rey Balduino) y a su propio hijo para ser reina. Los templarios aparecen como mafiosos obsesionados por la riqueza atacando a los mercaderes sarracenos cuando, al menos en aquellos momentos, su preocupacin era evitar que el Islam se reuniera en un ejrcito comn y retomara Jerusaln. Saladino aparece como alguien bondadoso que ofrece proteccin a sus prisioneros cuando en realidad vendi a todos como esclavos. Por qu la realidad histrica es ms apasionante que la propia pelcula? <br /> <br />Y es que lo que a Scott le preocupa en el apartado ideolgico no es la fidelidad a los hechos histricos sino la correcin poltica o, por ser ms exactos, el miedo: mejor alabar a los moros que a los cristianos. Por si acaso. l sabe muy bien las facilidades que tuvo para rodar en Espaa -incluso en el interior de templos cristianos- y los problemas que tuvo en Marruecos, donde el set tuvo que ser protegido por el ejrcito para evitar incidentes. Parece que tras el 11-S hubiese cado en una especie de sndrome de Estocolmo. <br />Desde luego, la religiosidad no la entiende. Pone en boca de los personajes, especialmente sacerdotes y obispos, afirmaciones como estas: quien es quemado no puede resucitar, a los que se suicidan hay que cortarles la cabeza... Evidentemente se trata o bien de una ignorancia preocupante o bien, directamente, de mala uva. Posiblemente lo ltimo, porque cualquier religioso cristiano que aparece est dibujado de modo sarcstico. <br />Pero lo que hace de El reino de los cielos una pelcula dbil, pese a manejar un amplio presupuesto, es su apartado cinematogrfico. Ciertamente est conseguida toda la puesta en escena y el diseo de produccin: decorados, fotografa, ambientacin... pero los errores en otros campos son numerosos. <br /> <br />  En primer lugar, la idea de que un herrero llegue a ser un gran seor (la normalmente estimulante historia del antihroe) est muy bien para Willow o La Guerra de las Galaxias pero en esta clase de pelculas emplear el recurso \\"sorpresa\\" de t eres mi hijo, yo soy tu padre, resulta caricaturesco y casi hasta tonto. Apoyar el relato en algo tan dbil, solucionar en unos segundos el aprendizaje de caballero, constrer la evolucin de un personaje a un instante, significa falta de profundidad. <br />Lo peor quiz, por tratarse de una pelcula de supuesto tono pico, es la carencia de ideas en las batallas. El naufragio est resuelto de un modo que no aceptara un principiante. La carga de los templarios contra los sarracenos queda escamoteada con un cambio de escenario: simplemente vemos la aproximacin de los ejrcitos y, luego, el campo lleno de cadveres. La destruccin del lienzo de muro de Jerusaln se resuelve con un fundido a negro tras el apelotonamiento de ejrcitos. La nica batalla seria slo nos llega a las 2 horas de metraje. Y lo grave es que Scott, como quiere, explcitamente, emular la batalla de Gondor de El Seor de los Anillos, obliga al espectador a compararlas. Y Scott no le hace ni sombra a Jackson. La nica secuencia verdaderamente lograda en toda la pelcula, cargada de fuerza y sentido, es la del Kerak, con la entrada del leproso Balduino, oculto tras su mscara, dispuesto a poner orden. <br /> <br />Existe una decidida apuesta por construir la historia sobre trminos de viaje inicitico: la evolucin y maduracin del carcter de un personaje a travs de un periplo que simboliza la vida. Lo cierto es que,al final, con perplejidad, nos queda la extraa sensacin de que todo aquello no es ms que un recorrido para encontrar novia. Uno se pregunta por qu el protagonista no escogi a una chica del pueblo cosa que, por otra parte, sabe hacer la mayora de la gente sin meterse en tantos problemas. El viaje inicitico queda aniquilado porque la evolucin del personaje ha sido nula. <br /> <br /> El reparto actoral: Orlando Bloom, un secundario resultn, no tiene carcter ni dotes para emprender una empresa protagonista como sta. Sus discursos en momentos cruciales nos dejan indiferentes Por qu no es el protagonista David Thewlis cuya formacin teatral le permite pronunciar las frases con empaque arcaico? Al ver esto, uno aora al Mel Gibson de Braveheart o El patriota. <br /> <br />Liam Neeson es eficaz, pero hay que poner buena intencin para no sonrer ante el personaje tan tpico que le han construido. El mejor, en cualquier caso, Jeremy Irons: como brazo derecho de Balduino realiza una interpretacin vigorosa que, pese a la brevedad, acaba por ser la que ms resalta. <br /> <br /> El error de El reino de los cielos, con un voluntario de ONG pacifista-ecologista que no nos podemos creer, es el mismo que acab con las recientes Troya y Alejandro. Creen que, en la pica, lo polticamente correcto debe suplantar a la lucha entre el Bien y el Mal. La antigua pica de honor ha sido sustituida por el desencanto tristn del racionalista. Y as, claro, el espectador no consigue enganchar <br />
0767821769|4.0|I liked this film from start to finish and it has top notch performances. The story is about a terminally-ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her ex-husband's life, who will be their new stepmother. The mother dosent like the way the new women acts and the why she worksa nd has kids. The acting is good from Susan Serandon, Julia Roberta give's a great performance also. Sadely this is a film that is forgotten fast and is underated. Overall it's touching,moving and funny it should entertain the whole family.
B000006MS3|4.0|Kate Bush is an artist who is known for her spectacular talent but who isn't known for her consistency.  I definitely consider myself a fan of Kate's music, but admittadly, her catalogue is hit or miss.  Albums that are released years apart from eachother that contain songs that are either REALLY amazing or REALLY mediocre...luckily, The Dreaming is an album that is consistently awesome with every track.  Though this LP is Kate at the peak of her lyrical and musical eccentricity, everything here works.  Songs range from bright pop pieces (\\"Sat in your Lap\\", \\"Suspended in Gaffa\\", \\"Get out of my House\\") to dark, emotive modern torch numbers (\\"Pull out the Pin\\", \\"Night of the Swallow, \\"Houdini\\")...everything here is memorable though and because she pioneered the vague abstract pixie lyricism that artists like Tori Amos and Bjork would later adopt, her words (and the way she sings them) become thought provoking long after the disc stops playing.
B000BTJCRM|3.0|It is not often these days that you can exactly describe a band but in this case you can: Jack White/Robert Plant singing tributes to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull and assorted (mostly) 70's hard rock bands.   <br /> <br />It's finely played and produced stuff if you don't mind the derivative nature of the material - 'Apple Tree' sounds like it is stolen directly from a White Stripes album.    <br /> <br />It's good riff-oriented rock'n'roll if you don't mind the fact that you have heard it all before. A great live act.
B00006SFBI|5.0|I have been a Mobile Fidelity fan for years.  To be sure their product is always top shelf.  This release is no exception...it beats the socks off of the regular issue in terms of musical presentation.  Still, this recording would shine in 5.1 surround, so come on MoFi, give us a 5.1 presentation.  Sure I know your contract with Sony (CBS) prohibits you from releasing 5.1 CDs of their products, but this is NOT a CBS product.  If you got the original master tapes, getting the original 8 track master would not be much more difficult.  Please try a little harder next time.
0399226907|5.0|This is a GREAT BOOK - my daughter's favorite from 2-3 years (and she still reads it at 4 because she can \\"read\\" it all by herself).
0440178002|5.0|\\"Very few men are wise-most are sinners and great evil happens on earth in gods name. But not of god. This world is vale of tears and only a preparation for the everlasting peace.\\"-James Clavell, page 1085, Shogun. <br /> <br />For some reason this statement, made by Japanese christen monk perfectly sums up the awesome book that is shogun. I don't mean awesome in the sense of \\"dude, that was awesome\\", I mean it in the sense that this book is awe inspiring, mind blowing and devastatingly emotional and good. <br /> <br />This is a book about a man named John Blackthorn, English pilot of the Dutch ship Erasmus who was washed ashore with what was left of his crew in the small Japanese village of Anjiro. His tale is amazing, for Blackthorn will become the man who brings Japan into the 17th century, introduces them to guns, and totally decimates the Portuguese Jesuit hold over Japan. None of this sounds good of course, but that's because this book isn't really about Blackthorn.  <br /> <br />I've always avoided Asian fiction and history, so I have no idea how accurate this book is. But, even if it's all total hooey, this book is amazing. It brings to life the Japan of flying cherry petals, green bamboo, samurai honor and wild mountain peaks. This is a book about honor and love and crossing cultural boundaries. It's a book about duty and karma and everything that is noble in life.  <br /> <br />Written in the style of Michener, only with more emotion, I can only say that this is one of the best books I have ever read. It's so good in fact, that I don't think I can ever read it again. It's a devastating emotional and draining experience to read this book, and if you can truly accept the feeling of honor and duty and courage and beauty that permeates every word that Clavell writes, I promise this book will, if not totally change your life, at least change your outlook on it. <br /> <br />I haven't stopped crying since finishing the book 20 minutes ago, and to be honest I don't want too. I truly feel to have left a world behind, along with true people whose honesty and courage were as true as the landscape of Japan itself. The people in this book do not appear to be friends; they are as much a part of me as they would be a part of any reader who can really allow the book to work its magic on them. <br /> <br />I really wish there was a rating above five stars.  <br />
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I did not realize this was a made for TV movie until I read some reviews here. I actually rented it, reluctantly, from a video rental store. I say reluctantly because the title left me with the impression this would be a shallow movie about a tough cop with a shoot'em up attitude. As I said, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />This movie was smart, and Selleck was the perfect man for the role. The main plot is interesting and the smaller side plots really help the movie and help flesh out the personality of Sellecks character (Jesse Stone). The personal demons of Jesse Stone are nicely weaved into the plot and do not in any way diminish the movie, they actually help it.  <br /> <br />I gave it 5 stars not because it is going down in history as one of the greatest movies ever, but because it was very entertaining and did not have alot of the typical hollywood political correctness garbage. Just a straight-forward, smart and entertaining movie. This is probably not very realistic, but you kind of wish more cops were like this. <br /> <br />You actually get alot for a 91 minute movie. It seems much longer (in a good way).
6305161992|5.0|This movie is AWFUL. The eighties t-shirts. Dolph Lundgren, who couldn't possibly look more Germanic if he tried, speaking Japanese and wearing the worst gi I have ever seen. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee) knowing karate and somehow absolutely nothing else about Japan. <br /> <br />The fight scenes were terribly choreographed. One involved a pressure hose that somehow knocked the muscle-bound Lundgren over (and yes, he does a slow-motion fall/yell when it hits him). There was no cohesion between scenes--meaning you were never quite sure why they were going anywhere, but it was probably for another fight. <br /> <br />The \\"Druglord,\\" who makes that cut simply because drugs involved, rather than for any criminal acumen, intelligence, or convincing scariness, makes deals with the local gangs (and apparently the Hispanics boycotted this movie, because that was DEFINITELY a white guy pretending to be Hispanic) to distribute his beer/drugs. Between the \\"local gangs\\" and the shirts the Yakuza henchmen were wearing, the scenes with the bad guys was some of the most unintentionally funny I've ever seen. The evil second-in-command was uncannily like Oddjob from the Bond movies, minus the deadly hat. <br /> <br />This movie SUCKS, but it sucks so badly and by 2005 is so dated, it's hysterically funny. For the women, Dolph Lundgren spends a good part of the movie without his shirt, wearing a tank-top, or stripped down to (short, tight) boxers. Which is honestly why I spent a Saturday afternoon watching a one-star movie: eye candy, and my God, was it stupidly funny.
0307276902|4.0|This book offers information about the drug culture that is important for people at risk of drug abuse to read in order to avoid James' misery. However, I feel the only two reasons James gave up drugs and alcohol was One, to avoid death, and Two to defy those that said he needed God. His inventory is truly awful, and I shudder when I remember what he \\"confessed\\".  He threw the Bible away because he wouldn't do what it says, I know he would agree. But that doesn't remove the fact that the Bible is true. Proverbs 1:7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and discpline. Proverbs 2:12-15 Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways, who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. 2 Peter 2:10 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority.<br /><br />Poor James, his only god is Me, Myself and I.
0723284075|5.0|I bought this set for my niece who lives in KS.  She will undoubtedly grow to love these stories.  Using Amazon was a much cheaper option instead of purchasing in Australia and posting to KS.  Also the price was far cheaper too <br /> <br />Very happy all round
B00006EXL5|5.0|Ok, a quite new band. Not know of a few years ago (which to some is frowned upon, but who wants to explain to them we all need to start somewhere..?)Its the better album of the two in my opinon and I love the songs and power in it. Definitley more reccomendable than the second album. Absolutley love it. <br />Can't wait for the next album late 2006 MCR!
076790382X|4.0|I've read books about the USA written by people who have lived here their whole lives, and by people who immigrated, but Bill Bryson's perspective as an American who has been gone 20 years is truly fascinating.  He points out things that I never would have thought about, like the difficulties of going to an American hardware store when you only know the British words for things.  Who knew that two countries that share a common language and (for the most part) a common culture could be so different?<br /><br />Bryson's writing is funny at times, and makes me angry at times, but is always thought provoking.  I do think the fact that he's only lived in small-town Iowa and New Hampshire slanted his perspecive somewhat; when reading, one has to keep in mind that many of the generalizations Bryson makes about America do not apply to cities with populations over 100,000.  If he had moved to Manhattan this would be a very different book indeed!<br /><br />That said, as someone who was raised in the US herself, lived abroad for a time, and then returned, I really enjoyed reading Bryson's observations.  Most importantly, this book made me laugh out loud, quite a bit in fact.  For that reason alone, I will definitely be reading more of Bryson's books in the future!
B00003CX96|4.0|As a native of Bloomington, Indiana, I can completely relate with the 'cutters' of this film. Although they were actually called 'stoners'. I'm proud to say I've made the 63 foot dive off the infamous Rooftop rock (in an abandoned quarry just outside of Bloomington). In all, great movie, really encompasses the time period. Watch it.

B00005MP58|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Jane Austen novel and so I had to give the BBC/A&E mini-series a whirl.  I have always loved this series because it remains true to the novel and the actors' portrayals of the characters are precise and wonderful.  Jennifer Ehle did a wonderful job playing Elizabeth Bennett.  She is just as I'd imagined the intelligent and grounded Elizabeth to be when I pictured the heroine in my head.  But the actor that really captivated me was Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  He was so on the mark in his portrayal of the arrogant, taciturn and reluctantly besotted Darcy that I cannot picture another actor outdoing his performance.  This is the work that made me look at Colin Firth's career more closely.  The rest of the series is wonderful with the Bennett family -- the hilarious fortune-hunting mother, the sarcastic father, the sensible and beautiful Jane, and the silly younger sister Lydia.  The other characters were fun to watch coming to life.  The period costumes and the scenery of the British countryside are second to none.  Absolutely gorgeous!  As for the actual DVD, I agree with the people who say that the special A&E DVD edition isn't very good.  The picture quality left a lot to desire and the bonus features aren't any better.  That is why I give this DVD four stars instead of five.  Five stars for the series itself and two stars for the DVD.  But you'd want to have this in your collection if you love this series as much as I do.
0307236722|5.0|I have only one word for this book, excellent!!! And I really mean it. It is so complete and the recipies are so easy to follow, you will find an answer to every question you may have about the preparation of each thing, so I need to say again Thank you Martha Stewart!!! You are my \\"guru\\".
0312995423|2.0|Dan Brown has failed to live up to his standard in this one. The storyline is weak, the coincidences too choreographed, the characters too diabolical ... Overall, the story is great in parts but the key and critical areas are seriously flawed:<br /><br />- TRANSLATR is melting down and there is no emergency response method triggered? Only 3 people know about the condition? Apparently fire codes don't apply to a $2BB investment.<br /><br />- Chatrukian's body short circuits TRANSLATR, and there is no automatic shut-off? Heck, if my toaster overheats, the MCG trips off!<br /><br />- The \\"Virtual Reality' view of system security shields 'thinning' as attackers approach the database is extremely childish. Shrek was more believable.<br /><br />If you like combinations of cliched images threaded together with verbose verbiage, this one is for you.
B000003AEB|5.0|I bought this CD in 1993 when the original version came out.  It had 19 tracks, not 18 or 13.  The real track 18 is \\"Gz Up, Hoes Down\\" and Track 19 is \\"Pump, Pump.\\"  I didn't even realize that later releases had tracks removed until I started looking for the album art for my iPod.   <br /> <br />This album is a classic.  if you want to buy it try to get the original with NINETEEN TRACKS.  Don't allow yourself to miss Snoop in his full artistic form.  This is definitely one of the Top Ten CD of All Time.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|I think I've figured out the formula behind Enya's songs.  First take out a mad libs, write \\"light\\", \\"love\\", \\"dark\\", \\"flower\\", \\"sea\\", and \\"stars\\" in the blank spots.  Add some wispy and haunting ballads, rinse, and repeat.  <br /> <br />I almost fell asleep listening to this CD.
B000005S31|4.0|An album that has been overviewed by many and didn't even receive a remastered edition on CD in the US, ''Coney Island Baby'' is doubtless one of the most pleasant Reed albums for fans or even casual listeners, in pair with some of his hyped releases, even if it's not groundbreaking and probably can't be put among his all-times' top5 records. The collection is full of sweet love songs, devotional ballads in which Reed celebrates the natural joy he was experiencing at that time, plus some unavoidable songs about drugs and the results are touching. The opener, ''Crazy Feeling'', is a simple, highly enjoyable composition that makes everybody smile and want to dance when no one's watching. The title track is one of Reed's classics, with top lyrics, cool spoken-sung verses and an exuberant second half where Reed celebrates the glory of love. ''Charley's Girl'', the smoothy ''Kicks'' and the nice but unnecessary re-recording of VU's classic ''She's My Best friend'' are equally enjoyable, and the album as a whole is a very nice, sweet experience. You won't want to skip any track.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Their earlier work was alot better. When I say \\"alot\\" I really do mean ALOT. The one thing that ruined this for me was Daron. He sounds like some emo kid, which I don't care to hear. I mean..I really tried to love this cd, but I just can't. I'm not saying this cd is horrible, some of the songs are actually good..it's just not there.<br /><br />Some might say \\"Well, they need to sound different\\". The problem is, they were different when they first started out. Listen to \\"Toxicity\\" and tell me that doesn't sound different than anything that's out right now.<br /><br />If you're are new to SOAD, then buy \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Steal This Album\\" for 16$. 2 Great cds. Otherwise, borrow this from a friend before buying it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Everyone knows Radiohead and their legendary music. This CD is no exception. With slow but somehow catchy \\"No Suprises\\" to the hard rocking \\"Electioneering\\" this CD has it all. I admit, I wasn't a big fan at first but than I finally sat down and listened to them for real. Gee, I was suprised. I would definetly consider the band Radiohead revolutionary. Anybody who has a real taste for music should give them a chance.    1.Airbag- An interesting first track. A unique blend of vocals and actual music. Maybe not a big time favorite but that doesn't mean it's a bad song    2.Paranoid Android- I admit, usually a track like this would turn me away, but I still thoroughly enjoy this song. Thom Yorke's voice is interesting in a good way    3.Subterranean Homesick Alien- This song wasn't very attractive the first time, but it had grown on me. You may have to give it more than a couple tries      4.Exit Music (For A Film)- This song, especially towards the second half, is so beautiful. Definitely a chill-inducer    5.Let Down- I really enjoy this track. It has a nice melodious song with the vocals and the music. Pretty cathcy    6.Karma Police- One of the best songs ever created.     7.Fitter Happier- You know how this one goes.    8.Electioneering- I'm usually not a fan of anything with electric guitar solos but this is an exception. Yorke belts out.    9.Climbing Up The Walls- I used to dislike this song but now, after listening to it for a couple years, I love it so much I came on here solely to update this review and say how brilliant it is.    10. No Suprises- The first song I ever fell in love with on this CD, suprisingly. It has a slow,calm, almost electronic beat but for some reason it's also quite catchy    11. Lucky- A song that also took some time to accept. As I said before, this isn't a personal favorite but I don't shine it    12.The Tourist- So good. Too good.    Personal Favorites- Paranoid Android Electioneering, No Surprises, and Karma Police, The Tourist, Climbing Up the Walls    Overall- This CD has a lot of flavor and indivduality but you must respect Radiohead for that. Try giving this album a second chance if you don't like it the first time, though you probably will.
0765315246|5.0|At the age of 75, on his birthday, John Perry entered the ranks of the Colonial Defense Forces.  He'd planned to do that with his wife, but she died unexpectedly one morning while preparing breakfast.  Lost and not knowing what to do, John follows through with the plan.  After all, according to everything he's heard, the CDF turns back the clock for all its conscripts.  However, getting a new body (a green one that falls just short of superhero) is just the beginning of the changes and shocks that John is in for.  He discovers that the universe is a HUGE place, and most of it is waiting to kill (and/or eat) CDF troops.<br /><br />This is John Scalzi's first book, but the follow-up to this novel, GHOST BRIGADES, is due out in February '06.<br /><br />OLD MAN'S WAR smacks entirely of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile SF novels with a vengeance.  However, the homage isn't just for the teen readers out there, it's also for all of the people who grew up on Heinlein's books.  The story is told, as many of Heinlein's were, in first person, and moves along at a quick pace, introducing technology, social ramifications, and potential science discoveries along the way.  Scalzi does a good job of putting the reader in John Perry's head, dealing with the things he has to deal with, with his friends, in training, and on the firing line.  The narrative is loose, yet driven.<br /><br />Overall, the background of the other races was painted a little too quickly.  However, in war soldiers often don't get the chance to truly know their enemies' motives and personal life, and it would have been interesting to see more of the military corps at work and find out who they're getting their tech from.  But that's probably why Scalzi is writing more books set in this interesting universe.<br /><br />OLD MAN'S WAR is an utterly delightful read.  Readers shouldn't expect anything that will change their lives or live with them forever, but a few hours of reading spent with this story will bring enjoyable rewards.  Fans of Joe Haldeman, John Ringo, David Drake, and Robert A. Heinlein will love this one.ring enjoyable rewards.  Fans of Joe Haldeman, John Ringo, David Drake, and Robert A. Heinlein will love this one.
0553213105|5.0|One of the all time best love stories about a young, feisty women in the 18th century, coping with everything from a mother bent on marriage to a seemingly snotty neighbor's friend.<br /><br />Elizabeth is the second oldest of five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, living in England during the 1800s. And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding  a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?<br /><br />I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and  realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.<br /><br />Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple years<br /><br />Overall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile. It truly is a great and classic love story so I would encourage everyone to show their support to Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy by reading this enchanting book.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have never seen the play or even listened to the broadway score before I went and saw this movie.  I don't know what it is that draws me to this movie, but theres a power there that I cannot escape.  I don't know if it's the memorable characters, the songs or their lifestyle that I identify with, but Im in complete awe everytime I listen to the soundtrack or watch the movie.  I saw this movie twice in the theater and I can't wait for the DVD to come out to watch the documentary of Jonathan Larson.  I also own the broadway album which I love since I've seen the film. My goal is to see the broadway show when they come down to my neck of the woods!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I have quite a few favorites on this CD. The first one being \\"Is This It.\\" This song is hard to describe. It's catchy because...Julian's voice and the music seem to go so well together. Next being \\"Someday.\\" Once again, Julian's voice matches the music so well. It's also a lot clearer. Another is \\"When it Started\\". I didn't like this song at first but the second time it really stuck on me. Has a slightly more upbeat pace that's fun (if you can) to sing along with.  Now for my favortie song on the CD and off it. \\"Hard to Explain\\" is a song I have been listening to for so long but somehow it never gets old.  Its chorus is catchy and I love this song completly.    Recommended- Younger kids probably wouldn't enjoy some of the electronic beats so... 12-Up.    Overall- The Strokes are one of my favorite bands and they really do know how to make good music and refuse to stop. I encourage every to give this CD a chance. It's catchy and fun and you'll never get tired of it.
B000ASATYO|5.0|I just got through watching the Director's Cut of \\"The Frighteners.\\"  I have to say first off that this is one of my favorite films of all time.  I don't particularly like horror films (I don't like to be scared) and so when this movie came out at the theater my sister tried to get me to see it and I refused because I thought it would scare me. <br /> <br />Needless to say when it came out on VHS she talked me into watching it and I regretted not going with her to see it in the theater.  The story is unique and well told. <br /> <br />I have to admit that there are some small gaps in the plot that may leave questions in your mind if you watch the original release (especially if you watch it more than once because you always catch more the second time around), but I never found it enough to be that distracting.  Part of this comes from them trying to cut the film down to less than two hours.  The Director's Cut answers a lot of these questions and I watched the entire thing.  It was definitely worth buying and I enjoyed it.  All the behind the scenes stuff was fantastic.  <br /> <br />I could go on about the story, but I'm more of a Visual Effects person and so I think that for me, that's also why I like this movie so much.  At the time the effects that they used were revolutionary.  Many of the effects, such as the ghost crawling under the carpet in the beginning utilized proprietary code that was written specifically for this movie.  Also the compositing was awesome.  There were only a couple of spots in the movie where I could tell that the lighting wasn't quite right, and that was out of well over five hundred visual effects shots.  To keep this in perspective, this movie was being filmed around the same time the first \\"Toy Story\\" was released, so that was the level of computer generated imagery that they had to work with.  I think that they had fewer errors in their work than \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" that was just released.  I saw more incorrect lighting and bad animation in \\"Narnia\\" than in \\"The Frighteners.\\"  It just goes to show you that advanced technology does not always make a better movie. <br /> <br />Also, the release of this movie was pushed up by four months, which caused them to rush with wrapping up production.  The DVD is also well worth buying if you're at all interested in film making, visual effects or any similar field.  The documentary has a ton of behind-the-scenes footage, a tour of the early WETA computer and props department, and three full compositing breakdowns that show how they put the special effects together. <br /> <br />I wouldn't say that you should buy this movie if you haven't seen it because everyone's tastes are different, but I would definitely borrow or rent it so you can decide whether you want it or not.  Before the Director's cut was released, the original release on DVD was selling on eBay for thirty dollars or more because it was out-of-print and people were desparate to find it.  I wound up paying nearly twenty for a used copy.  Obviously this movie has a big cult following at any rate and that makes me happy, because I think that this film has been overlooked and underrated.  It is definitely on my list of best movies of all time.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|Sorry folks I can't believe the high ratings for this CD. I am/was a Strokes fan loved their live shows but this CD is unlistenable a real disapointment. <br /> <br />I always give a CD several listens before making a judgement and in this case more listens did not make it any more appealing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002KAT|5.0|I decided to write this to clarify that this music is on the art side not the entertainment side. Unfortunately, our culture has taken to the habit of calling entertainers artists. This creates confusion when we come across a genuine work of art in the pop/rock genre. This work is among a tiny group of pop/rock albums that are works of art. Some of the reviews here are applying pop sensibilities to a work of art and the result is absolutely silly.
B00026W82U|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm in a love affair with the acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies, or maybe it's the fact that The Kings of Convenience love jazz as much as I do.  Whatever it is, this is hands-down my favorite album of all time.  It starts off with a tongue in cheek ode to Simon and Garfunkel that prefectly hits its mark.  They follow it with the bossa nova infused \\"Misread\\" and just beautiful \\"Cayman Islands\\".  I could go through this album and tell you how I love every song, but I won't bore you to death.  I will just say that there is not a song on here I ever skip.  My favorite moment of the album comes in song 11(\\"Gold In The Air Of Summer\\").  A fantastic instrumental bridges crescendos to a held out note from a horn, and then the bottom drops out and the scandanavian songsters go acapella.  Their harmonies sound amazing throughout; but acapella, my God.  Although more sonically dense then i usually like my relazed acoustic music, this album jsut does everything right.  I hope these guys will make it out to Pennsylvania sometime, because I would give my right arm to see them live. <br /> <br />Best Songs -  <br />\\"Gold In The Air Of Summer\\", \\"Stay Out Of Trouble\\", \\"Love Is No Big Truth\\"
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Do not listen to the pessimistic reviews of WT: Silent Force. Sharon CAN sing! Granted she is not Celine Dion in a powerful voice, but she is not that horrible garbage that comes out of Britney Spears either. Her voice suits the music perfectly. It has such a haunting quality that attracted me right away. But her singing can be sweet and heart-touching as well. Some don't like the slow songs, but they are just as fine as the other songs. Those that harp over that simply want the grunge rock growling and so on. That just isn't Within Temptation to me. I heard one of their earlier songs with the growling male alongside Sharon's soaring melodies and it sounded absolutely rediculous! Over all, the heavy rock, powerful choir, and Sharon's voice create a unique sound that I love. And I'm sure you'll love it too! <br /> <br />1. \\"Intro\\" 4/5 - A powerful entrance with choir and Sharon's voice! Great way to start off <br />2. \\"See Who I Am\\" 5/5 - BOOM! This song explodes powerfully and never ceases from full throttle! Simply awesome and great way to start the album. <br />3. \\"Jillian\\" 5/5 - Like others have said, the choir's singing in the background is addictive. This song keeps the album running strong! <br />4. \\"Stand My Ground\\" 4/5 - Starts off sweet sounded then you find yourself drawn into the dark mood and soaring voice of Sharon. A bit of a slow down, but still a great song! <br />5. \\"Pale\\" 3/5 - Major slow down with this song (but your racing heart needs a break by now) but pretty good with it's haunting melody.  <br />6. \\"Forsaken\\" 5/5 - Another explosive song with an unceasing power of choir and lead singer in tandem with rocking guitars! <br />7. \\"Angel\\" 4/5 - What starts off as sounding like a sweet ballad of love turns into a vengeful slap to the face! Amazing change of mood and tempo. <br />8. \\"Memories\\" 4/5 - A slow down again, but worth it. A heart-touching melody that is sad in a way, but reminds you to remember the good times with that loved one. A very moving song! <br />9. \\"Aquarius\\" 3/5 - Sharon doesn't hold back in this song! A dark song of need and hunger with choir and singer raising the roof with their voices. <br />10. \\"It's The Fear\\" 5/5 - A strong song that inspires the feelings of fear and dread like the name implies. Another great song! <br />11. \\"Somewhere\\" 4/5 - Sharon could sing this song a cappella and it still would be moving. Another wonderful ballad. <br />12. \\"A Dangerous Mind\\" 5/5 - Just when you think the album is pretty much done, WT hits you with one of the most intense songs on the entire CD! I can only describe this song as amazing! I would have bought this album for just this song alone! <br />13. \\"The Swan Song\\" 3/5 - Starts off with a Celtic feeling to it with the instruments. A nice slow song that is a fitting end to a diverse and great album! <br /> <br />Overall This is a wonderful album I don't regret buying and I highly recommend it to anyone that's interested. A definite must buy!
B00004XQP4|5.0|I was blown away by this cd. I had heard it was underrated but not like this. This album is a perfect expample of Green Day's ability not to care about anything, like being accused of not being \\"punk\\" enough. Every track is very diverse from each other, and songs like  Warning, Misery, Hold On, Jackass, Minority and Macy's Day Parade prove that accoustic guitars can rock just as hard as an electric. Every song is great, no filler tracks here. I guess that the fans didn't take to the album well because it was too much of a change, too soon. One time, in my Language Arts class, I had to write a paper about what songs inspired us, and I chose Green Day's Hold On (off this album) because it is so great. My favorite songs: all of them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must tell you. I had never seen Firefly or heard anything about it until I saw Serenity in theaters. I was instantly in love. This show supports some of the greatest characters I have ever seen in a TV show. Packed with action and humor, trust all of these reviews when we say this TV DVD is the best choice you could make this year!
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I wasn't expecting much considering the last couple albums were not great, but this album was everything I could hope for in a new branch of korn.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I feel sorry for their adopted kids.  Think about it, they don't get their good looks, but they inherit their knowledge.  Pitt has and actual IQ of 91 and Jolie is so crazy her father even thinks she's nuts.  It's sad how fate has such a sick sense of humor.
044651652X|5.0|Waller takes the lonely plains of the midwest and creates a magical landscape where two lost souls connect with such passion. His characters are very well developed, and the story itself is simply beautiful - yet heartbreaking. Admittedly, Waller lays it on a bit thick at times, but this is a romance novel, so that should be expected. By the end of the novel, I was left with such a sense of sadness for these two lovers.
B00014NE62|5.0|It is difficult to speak of a classic and this film is one. E.M. Forster is also an English writer who has tact and some natural nobility. He makes radiant any subject he touches. And this subject is delicate if not difficult. It was when the book came out and it still was when the film came out. Nowadays it has lost its smell of sulphur and hell and in spite of all the tricksters and mud-throwers around it smells of love and it carries a strong appeal for those who just have a mind.<br /><br />We cannot avoid thinking of Lady Chatterley's Lover but we are no longer dealing with a woman but with a man, with straight love but with gay love and it is necessary to give a general idea of the story for any commentary to make sense. It starts at Cambridge when two young men fall in love, Clive declaring his love to the other and this other, Maurice, being repulsed at first and then apologizing and accepting his attraction. The point is that the one who declared his love first is the aristocrat whereas the other is from a stock exchange family. And that's the latter's first loss. He is cleanly and immediately kicked out of Cambridge because he missed a few classes to spend the afternoon with Clive and refuses to apologize to the Dean.<br /><br />But another of their university mates, Viscount Risley, managed to get in some kind of fix in an East End pub one night when he buys some quick pleasure from a cadet in a back alley. He is \\"captured\\" by the police and dragged to court. This Viscount is a Parliamentary Private Secretary and is at the start of a political career. He is abandoned by every one, including Clive, and the judge condemns him lightly as for the prison term but ruins his political career forever with the clear mention that \\"instead of setting an example to the people\\", he looked for favours from people who were his \\"inferiors\\" and he used his advantageous superiority in education to do so.<br /><br />This reveals the deeply social segregational attitude of England then. The social difference made such a relationship unacceptable to justice with a strong emphasis on this social  barrier that the culprit dared cross.<br /><br />That makes Clive change his position entirely. He decides to drop Maurice, apart from a platonic friendship and to marry a girl who is full of love but not too subtle on the real emotions of her husband. This rebuff from Clive sends Maurice to hell and he tries to find a way out with doctors and even a hypnotist who comes up with the fair advice to move to a country like France where homosexuality is accepted. And his conclusion is final: \\"England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.\\"<br /><br />But in the meantime Maurice falls in love with Clive's gamekeeper, Alec. In fact it seems the gamekeeper smelled the possible emotional opening in Maurice and Maurice did not rebuff him and then Alec moved forward and Maurice let him do so. The love is strong but Maurice is afraid of some blackmail, and yet he goes on as far as possible before Alec leaves England for Argentina. But Maurice will find out the ship leaves without Alec and he will run back to Clive's place and will subodorate that Alec is waiting for him in the boathouse and sure enough here he is.<br /><br />The first element is that E.M. Forster's novel was one essential milestone on the slow and long road that led England to two fundamental mental reforms. The first one has to do with gay love and England was not the first country to move on such a subject after WW2 but in fact they moved rather fast though they still have some way to go. But the second mental reform is far from being complete. It is social segregation. In 1910-1913 when the action takes place that social segregation is absolute: the relation, between the aristocracy and the lower classes were absolutely not acceptable in any way, particularly of course emotionally, sentimentally or sexually. D.H. Lawrence had proved it with his above-quoted novel for women and E.M. Forster proved it with this here novel and film.<br /><br />The arguments emphasized by the judge are absolutely univocal: a member of the nobility could not in any way have any kind of an affair with someone from a lower social station. The fact that at the same time the Anglican church and the society as a whole condemned gay love and gay sex as immoral and un-natural if not anti-natural, does not in anyway alleviate the horror of that social discrimination in people's sentimental, emotional and sexual private lives. And at the same time it is this very fact that this social discrimination is a lot more powerful than the moral condemnation that gives Maurice and Alec a possible choice, a possible chance.<br /><br />Alec could miss his ship because he wanted to stay with Maurice, that was his free choice, and Maurice could run after him blindly because he wanted Alec to stay and be part of his life, and that was also his free choice, and that is in a way possible for them both because Maurice is working at the Stock Exchange, in a brokerage house and he is not in anyway part of the nobility and aristocracy. That's their chance and Alec could become in a way or another some employee of Maurice's and then the rest was discretion and love. And eventually they could move to another country.<br /><br />But this film, like Lady Chatterley's Lover, should be shown to all teenagers and discussed with them for them to come to the feeling, the empathy that social segregation is absurd. You love someone for so many reasons that any segregation has no sense, and you can love someone in so many ways, sex being one of the ways and in no way obligatory or necessary, that any segregation is idiotic. No one should question who other people love nor how they love the people they love, not to mention the people they want to marry.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnd E.M.

B000031XCR|5.0|I had to buy this album, I thought that it would be better to buy this first and then explore the rest of her catalogue, I was blown away by the quality of this album, the songs are amazing, her voice is superior and the production is top-notch.<br /><br />All the classics are here, Titanic theme \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and 1999 smash hit and my personal favourite \\"That's The Way It Is\\". With such a long running time your immediate reaction may be, 'Oh, no I'm just going to be listening to the same type of song over and over again!!', don't frustrate yourself, relax, this album has more than just her stereotypical adult-contemporary stuff, it has rock and even crossover-genre music, more than enough to satisfy you. Celine's voice has become iconic and many people only know her because of a certain song called \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", however Celine is more than that, she is a true artist, spreading messages through the medium of song. She doesn't sing about one-night stands, girl-fights, public humiliation, sex and the other 'manufactured' topics that many artists sing about, she sings about life and love, remaining respectable and mature at the same time. There is nothing cringe-worthy or novelty about her work, it comes from the heart, and that's deep. I love every song on this album, for me they are all masterpieces in their own right and really need no in-depth analysis. Just appreciate Celine's music for what it is, true heart-spoken ethereal bliss.
B00008YJH5|2.0|- Barely any melody <br />- Poor attempts at harmonizing (except Gigantic and Where is My Mind) <br />- sub-par rhythm section <br />- Sounds worse than a live album. Sounds like my band practicing but with a bigger budget. <br /> <br />I tried to like the pixies. I tried, really hard too. I'm musically open minded and like similar artists like Superchunk, The Wrens, Smashing Pumpkins etc. ...i just can't ...like this except for a few songs. <br /> <br />Thank god I downloaded this, or i'd be selling it now.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Director:  Bryan Singer <br />Cast:  Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Bryne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito, Suzy Amis, Dan Hedaya. <br />Running Time:  106 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and a substantial amount of strong language. <br /> <br />\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is, quite simply, a masterpiece of cinematic intrigue and suspense. At various points throughout its runtime, it is almost disarmingly comic, action-packed and insightful, yet at any given point when the film seems to be conforming to the clichs of its genre, the director is merely toying with the viewer and laying the foundations for one of cinema's most memorable climaxes.  \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.\\" So says Kevin Spacey's Verbal Kint to his interrogator Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a US Customs Officer investigating the quayside slaughter of dozens of Argentinian sailors in what looks like the bloody aftermath of a major drugs deal. Mysteriously, Kint has been granted immunity in exchange for evidence, but the story he weaves in Kujan's office just doesn't seem to add up. Just how reliable is Kint's take on events leading up to the massacre, the genesis of which occurred some six weeks earlier when five ex-cons were bizarrely rounded up for an identity parade at a New York police station? Kint, one of the five, and, hampered by physical deformities, definitely the sickliest, appears to be the only survivor. He also appears to be the only witness to the death of the alleged ringleader of the group, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a notoriously corrupt ex-cop. But Kujan has a hard time believing that Keaton is really dead. He knows his form, and had not for one moment bought Keaton's recent line that his criminal days were behind him. Besides, Kint's evasive, slithering persona does not inspire confidence that what he's telling approximates to anything like the truth.  Looming over everything; however, is the unseen presence of Keyser Soze, a near-mythical Turkish crime-lord who embodies the elusive cunning of the devil to whom Kint alludes. Soze appears to be pulling all the strings, yet it's by no means clear that he's not simply a figment of the paranoid imagination of a collective criminal mind. <br /> <br />Spacey and Byrne, a study in contrasts both physical and temperamental, bring actorly gravitas to Bryan Singer's stylish and eloquent crime film. Spacey (who won Best Supporting Actor for the role) seems to shrink within himself as Kint, carrying his wounded, twisted body with the caution of a dog who's expecting a kicking; yet his ever watchful presence betrays a canny awareness that suggests he's not necessarily the weak link he may at first sight appear. Byrne, physically imposing and craggy-featured, is evidently a far more dangerous proposition than Spacey, yet the existential angst that grips him is characterized by a troubled conscience that makes him easily the most complex of the group. Director Bryan Singer and his screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie will be forever thankful for the inspiration that conjured Keyser Soze, for without him \\"The Usual Suspects\\" would simply be a routine, if gripping thriller, if it existed in any form at all. With him, Singer and McQuarrie have crafted something of a genre classic, complete with a breathtaking climactic twist that's right up there with \\"The Crying Game\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense\\" in the gobsmacking movie surprise stakes.  One of the better, most intelligent films of the middle of the decade.
B00006LLNU|5.0|As a newly converted post - rock devotee, I was scrounging the internet for the best the genre has to offer. I came across this, and I am glad I did. <br /> <br />When this album came, I was blown away by the packaging - everything about the album is tranlucent - the booklet, the CD cover, the back - even the gentle ( ) mark is only inscribed on the cd with a clear gloss. No liner notes whatsoever. Truly honest music. <br /> <br />I popped it in, turned off the lights, and WOW. From the first mellow chord, the music will sink into you. None of the music is imposing. It is all open to interperetation. It takes you through the hills and valleys of your emotions. It is the search for, the love, and the wrath of God. Not at all what I expected, but so much better. <br /> <br />I will admit, the vocals are taking a little while to get used to. They are apparently just jibberish - not icelandic, not english, but rather randomly compiled sounds and syllables. But as I get more used to it, the more I realize how emotional and beutiful it is. On their website, they have dubbed it \\"Hopelandic\\". Although it isn't now, it will probably end up being one of my favorite parts of the album. <br /> <br />As an inspiring Psychologist, I was blown away by the theraputic nature of this album. I've made sense of more emotional conflicts by listening to this album than I have when I tried to combat it with hours of logic. <br /> <br />Just like the packaging suggests, you can see through this album. It doesn't force any message on you or try to convert you to any religion. It doesn't have limits. It's just like a beautiful car you can take anywhere. Each listen is a different experience. It all depends on what you put behind it. <br /> <br />Get this album now.
0684824906|5.0|I thought I had a pretty good familiarity with Abe Lincoln, who is, of course, widely regarded as one of our very best Presidents.  Certainly I have read much about Mr. Lincoln, including David Donald's excellent \\"Lincoln,\\" published in 1996.  It was with some hesitation, therefore, that I cracked opened the most recently published book on this remarkable man, \\"Team of Rivals,\\" by Doris Goodwin (October 1995), given to me by a good friend.  Did I really want to read yet another Lincoln book, consisting of over 700 pages?  Hasn't it all been said before? <br /> <br />Well, I read the book within the space of just one week, and it blew me away.  This, in my opinion, is the finest book on that heroic President ever written.  Ms. Goodwin, by focusing on his inner life and his relationships with his hand-picked Presidential cabinet, along with friends, foes, generals and politicos, lovingly surfaced for us readers all the characteristics that made Mr. Lincoln the most noble man - and finest President - of the last two centuries.   <br /> <br />The battles of the Civil War are lightly dealt with; for that, we can read Shelby Foote, Bruce Catton and the like.  But to truly understand Mr. Lincoln - the man - and how he led the nation, I cannot think of a better book.  Frequently alone and often vilified by radical Republicans, on one side, and conservative Democrats, on the other, he carefully navigated a middle course that accomplished the greatest good for the greatest number.  And, if he'd not been assassinated by the crazed actor Booth, he might have saved the country from so much post-War misery and anguish.   <br /> <br />Lincoln was a complex - and often contradictory - figure.  Lacking a formal education, and not terribly erudite, he was wiser than virtually anyone around him.  Lacking little political experience until his surprise election to the Presidency in 1860, he was one of the shrewdest politicos of the 19th century.  Often dour and introspective, he exhibited a wide-ranging sense of humor, and could charm his enemies as well as his friends - and got  them to go willingly (and sometimes reluctantly) where he wanted to take them.  He was firm and in control at all times, yet never had to overpower or steam-roll his associates or often-conniving and obstreperous cabinet members; and he never held a grudge.  Abe was humble and yet exceedingly confident, and knew that he would ultimately bring the Union together, while at the same time winning emancipation for America's slaves.  <br />  <br />Ms. Goodwin brings out all of these remarkable qualities in an eminently readable fashion.  We cry with Abe during the tragedies in his life, including the death of his and Mary's beloved son, Willie, and the early defeats and frustrations of the Civil War.  We laugh with him in his casual conversations and legendary story-telling, and exult with him in his victories.  Our tears stem from the love we develop, as the story unfolds, for this most human of all presidents.  There is little doubt, in my mind at least, that Abe Lincoln was not only the greatest President of our United States, but also one of the finest men that ever lived.  As so aptly put by his Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, upon Lincoln's death, \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\"  Indeed, he does. <br /> <br />Get this book and read it; it's a tour de force. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|this is one of the best films of 2005 if not the best.  keira knightley is outstanding as elizabeth bennet in this latest recreationg of the jane austen classis pride and prejudice.  this is a beautiful intrepretation of the novel that truly captures the comedy and romance of the story.  this film is wonderful in every way!!  i highly reccomend seeing this film.  it's fantastic!
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the Batman comic book series and in my mind is the best in a series of recent adaptations of the Caped Crusader.  (Keep in mind, however, that I only found the Michael Keaton Batman and Val Kilmer's Batman Forever mildly diverting while I found Batman Returns and Batman and Robin to be virtually unwatchable).<br /><br />The basic story of the film is explaining how Bruce Wayne (played surprisingly well by Christian Bale) became Batman.  The story is familiar - Bruce Wayne's parents are cut down in the course of a crime and Bruce devotes his life to justice.  However, what makes Batman Begins superior to the previous entries is that is shows how the path to justice could easily have veered into vengance and vigilantism.  Indeed, early in the film Bruce is confronted by Ra's al-Ghul, a Bhutan-based martial arts master who has taken the second, darker path.<br /><br />The viewer needs to keep in mind that this film falls outside of the timeline of the previous four Batman adaptations; thus, for example, the killer of the Wayne parents is different in this film than it is in the Keaton Batman series.  That said, the story is well told and flows logically; by the end of the film the main questions of how Bruce Wayne became Batman will be answered.<br /><br />The dichotomy between vengence and justice plays throughout the film, which is dark in nature but not in its ultimate message.  That said, Batman Begins is a film that takes itself seriously and is not a film that has been punched up with a witty sidekick or other comic relief.  That the film is not overwhelmed by its seriousness is a tribute to both the director and a superb cast of both main and supporting actors.  The only moment when the film starts to veer out of the control of director Christopher Nolan is an overly long car chase sequence.  That said, this film flies by (no pun intended) for a movie that clocks in at 140 minutes.<br /><br />The cast is very strong and includes Morgan Freeman as gadget man Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Sergant Gordon, Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Rutger Hower as Wayne Enterprises CEO Earle, and Ken Wantanabe as Ra's Al Ghul.  Katie Holmes shows that she is more than Mrs. Tom Cruise with a well-rounded performance as love interest Rachael Dawes.  Given the star power in the supporting cast, I'm a bit surprised that Christian Bale, a relative unknown, got cast in the title role.  I was pleasantly surprised by his range in this role, which is likely to vault him into super-stardom.<br /><br />Special effects in this film are nothing remarkable, though the shots in Iceland (which plays Bhutan in this film) are beautiful cinematography.  The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding and reflects the dark and serious nature of the film instead of veering into a comic book sensibility.<br /><br />The single-disk DVD is extremely basic - English and French soundtracks and English, French, and Spanish subtitles.  Other than that the only feature is a trailer.  If you are someone who likes DVDs that are tricked out with commentaries and other bonus features then you should probably look at the two-disk Deluxe edition.<br /><br />That said, if you want to see one of 2005's best films and a new standard for the Batman series, this is the film to watch.n Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Sergant Gordon, Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Rutger Hower as Wayne Enterprises CEO Earle, and Ken Wantanabe as Ra's Al Ghul.

B00026W82U|4.0|...like they love to make the sense of intimacy stronger than you'd like to admit at first, they wipe off all what stands for separation between tunes - rhythm.<br /><br />All these small minimalistic guitar tappings with hammer onoff makes the main melody melt into the soft voice of our very Kings. This album is also a bit of a classical Convenience-art, aftercoming albums influenced by this creates follow-ups, but nothing can be ripped off in this state of acoustic music: really tempting, close, working out the intimacy a hundred procent.<br /><br />What could be judged whatsoever might be the distance from trying to explore - a couple of the songs are mainly floating by like streams hidden troughout the track setting. Good job, though!! Recommendation for spring / summer =)

B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie was very good.  I think it deserves a lot of attention from the awards for best movie and actor.  I hope many see this film, it has taken on new territory.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...<br /><br />You know, I didn't go see this movie in the theater because everything that I had heard about it led me to believe that it was essentially the Ally McBeal Halloween Special. I wish that I hadn't listened to the haters and actually gone to see this movie on the big screen, because I ended up enjoying it on DVD. My hesitance to see the movie came primarily from the fact that I knew that about half of the movie took place in a courtroom. But what seems like a completely unworkable concept, a courtroom drama with a demon, actually ends up being a fairly effective and creepy horror movie. The Ghoulie Guru Jury finds the Exorcism of Emily Rose Not Guilty of being a bad movie.<br /><br />The only parts that don't work in this movie are the courtroom scenes. I don't like courtroom dramas, and this one has all the clich&eacute;d moments. The impassioned speeches from the defense, the surprise witnesses, the whole bit. I don't like movies where you spend 90 minutes waiting for the verdict to be passed down by the jury. But, if you can get through the courtroom scenes, there are some great moments in this movie. I can't help but think that this movie would have been so much scarier if it had been linear. Most of the scariest scenes are told in flashback, which takes away all their venom. I already know that the priest survives the scary exorcism scenes because he's the one telling the story. It's the same thing that crippled the Exorcist prequel. We all know that Father Merrin survives, so why should we be scared? However, if they had told the story linearly, then the whole structure would have been even stranger. You would have had 45 minutes of a scary movie and then 45 minutes of a courtroom drama. As it is, mixing the two up seems to be the only way to really make this movie work.<br /><br />In the end, I wound up liking this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I also think it's a better demonic possession movie than either of the Exorcist prequels. The scenes of Emily when she's possessed are almost as scary as some of the better moments from the original Exorcist. I also like the fact that the movie grounded the idea of demonic possession in medical fact, a bit like the old 70's movie THE ENTITY. It's not a perfect horror movie, because the courtroom scenes really do drag the thing to a grinding halt every time, but this is a solid rental for fans of the genre and might be worth adding to your collection if you can't get enough of the demon possession movies.r of the Exorcist prequels.

B000002MI4|4.0|Elvis Costello (Declan MacManus) has done his fair share of collaborations in the past decade. From the Grammy-award winning project with Burt Bacharach in 1998 to 2001's subdued \\"For the Stars\\" with Anne-Sophie von Otter Costello has branched out from his rock roots in diverse directions. \\"The Juliet Letters\\" from 1993 was the first in a long line of such collaborations. Costello and the Brodsky Quartet were brought together by mutual appreciation (Costello went to Brodsky Quartet concerts while the Brodsky Quartet attended Costello concerts). And Costello's now ex-wife Cait O'Riordan provided the epistolary theme for the project. She spotted a newspaper article about a professor that responded to letters addressed to \\"Juliet Capulet\\". Costello then presented the article to the quartet for inspiration. The group of five ended up writing all of the music and words (though much of the music is credited to \\"MacManus\\"). The results fall somewhere between classical song cycles and Beatle-inspired \\"string rock\\" (a la \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"). Feelings of melancholy and anger pervade most of the songs. The strings punctuate these feelings perfectly. Fans of Costello's rock music probably won't find much to appreciate here. But the album contains many of the same classic Costello themes and vocal styles utilized in his rock.<br /><br />Like a Richardson novel, letters provide the basis for the project. Failed and frustrated relationships abound. \\"Thank you for the flowers / I threw them on the fire / And I burned the photographs that you had enclosed / GOD they were ugly children\\" Costello sings venemously on the driving \\"I Almost Had a Weakness\\". After all, nothing seeps loneliness more than an unanswered love letter. But more than love gets the treatment here. Other songs include a suicide note (\\"Dear Sweet Filthy World\\"), a letter from a soldier to a stranger (\\"I Thought I'd Write to Juliet\\"), a bizarre experiment in selective exhumation (\\"Damnation's Cellar\\"), a reflection on separation (\\"Why?\\"), and a letter full of hope in the face of despair (\\"The Birds Will Still Be Singing\\"). Many songs explore the sad one-sided nature of letter writing. And no song responds to any other song. This fills the songs that deal with ineffable questions with an almost desparing isolation. But not everything is doom and gloom. \\"This Offer is Unrepeatable\\" picks up the mood with a humorously exaggerated letter from a scam artist (and it more than a little resembles the Tom Waits' classic \\"Step Right Up\\"). The final song injects some hope into the stark themes in the manner of \\"Old Man River\\": \\"Banish all dismay / Extinguish every sorrow / If I'm lost or I'm forgiven / The birds will still be singing\\". So in the end, things aren't as bad as they seem. The world goes on regardless of our ephemeral concerns. And as long as the world goes on hope exists.<br /><br />This CD contains a lot of very beautiful and moving music. Two violins, a viola, a violincello, and voice provide all of the instrumentation. Costello branched out into something very different here. And not all of his fans appreciated it. Regardless, in retrospect \\"The Juliet Letters\\" pointed to the future. This year Costello will tour orchestra halls. Not only that, he also wrote a full orchestral score (\\"Il Sogno\\"). Strings appear more frequently in his recent music. And year by year he seems to embrace \\"classical\\" music more intensely. Still, he hasn't abandoned rock and pop (as \\"When I Was Cruel\\" and \\"The Delivery Man\\" testify). Though this early collaboration remains somewhat underappreciated, it nonetheless fully showcases Elvis Costello's diverse, adaptable, and broad musical scope.

It was not a bad movie, and had some interesting moments, but mostly I found the characters to be one dimensional, and I was apathitic to all of them.  There was no spark in Big Fish. <br />Good special effects and good acting, but the story kind of held everything back.

B000BYA4JM|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna movie and one of my favorite 80's movies because it is so funny and Madonna plays such a unique character.      Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a street-wise ex-con with white hair and a good left hook.     Nikki meets up with Louden Trott (played by Griffin Dunne) who was assigned to pick her up after she was released from prison and take her to the bus station. Mr. Worthington (Bibi Besch) doesn't want Nikki anywhere near his daughter Wendy's (Haviland Morris) wedding to Louden because he was the one who set her up to go to the big house!    Nikki convinces Louden to stop at the mall because after all her mom thinks she's been shopping for the past four years so it wouldn't be very nice to come home empty handed. But Nikki has ulterior motives because she wants to \\"cleah my name\\" and prove to everyone that she was set up.    It's now a race to see if Nikki can con Louden into helping her. Along the way they fall in love. But Louden is an uptight boy from Scarsdale who has reservations about a kooky girl from Philly.     But, Nikki gets to Louden's wedding and stops the preacher in mid-sentence so that she can tell everyone that Mr. Worthington set her up. She also informs everyone that Louden is really in love with her, and this time he has the backbone to fight for her. Wendy doesn't mind though, she has her hot UPS driver to keep her company.     Louden and Nikki take their bus trip together back to Philly as Madonna's third '87 hit plays, \\"Who's That Girl.\\"      Madonna's acting was wonderful, and she sounded so funny and looked very sexy. But the poor thing was crucified for this picture, unrightfully so.
B000BHN7DE|5.0|I just got this today from UK Amazon (cheaper than on here) and I was stunned that it came in a \\"book\\"-like package. The package is amazing and beautiful with the lyrics inside on the pages. The CDs are in sleeves in the front and back of the package. <br /> <br />But what really counts is the tracks and amazing remixes on the remix CD. By the way, the description on here is wrong for the special edition. There is no DVD included in the packaging: just Disc 1 (with all her hits and 4 new songs and a megamix) and the remix disc. There will be a DVD being released of her Live at Last tour in March, so look for that.  <br /> <br />All of her singles are here (except for Boom and Love is a Crime, though they are on the remix disc) as well as 4 new songs. The title track and new single, Pieces of a Dream, which is amazing and a pure Anastacia rock ballad. There's also I Belong to You, with Italian singer Eros, another ballad and In Your Eyes (ballad) as well as her contribution to the Fantastic 4 soundtrack with Ben Moody, Everything Burns. The club megamix is a almost-12 minute dance tour de force, including her biggest hits, totally remixed. It is amazing. <br /> <br />The remix disc is really good too, including some rare remixes of her biggest hits as well as to Love is a Crime and Boom. It's an amazing addition to have to this greatest hits set. <br /> <br />It really sucks that she isn't more known in the US. Most of my friends don't know who she is. I hope that whenever she releases her fourth studio album, she works harder to try and break the US. I really hope she can get successful here in the US. <br /> <br />So buy this awesome greatest hits package! You won't regret it.

0143036556|4.0|Can the past help to keep the future? In Collapse (a sequel to Guns, Germs and Steel), Jared Diamond set out to examine why societies failed or succeeded. As a UCLA professor of geology, he focuses on unwise environmental choices using a five-points framework: the affect of people on their environment, the impact of climate change, the harm by hostile neighbors, the loss from decreased support from friendly neighbors, and the response of society to its problems.<br /><br />Diamond starts with Montana where irresponsible mining and unfettered logging damaged its natural beauty and where debates over government regulations embody differences between rich and poor. Then, Diamond reviews the failures of past societies such as Easter Island from deforestation, Pitcairn Islands from lack of trade, the Anasazi from climate change, and the Maya from overpopulation. He compares the lost civilizations of the Vikings of Iceland and the Norse of Greenland and to the unbeaten Inuit. He briefly mentions two past successes: Tikopia Island in New Guinea and the Tokugawa rule in Japan.<br /><br />In modern societies, Diamond starts with Rwanda where according to one Rwandan those who did not have shoes massacred those who did. Then, how Haiti and The Dominican Republic, two societies on the same island, have very different outcomes. And of course, China as a Third World dragon aspiring for a First World standard of living. He ends with the fragility of Australian environment.<br /><br />Why did they take down the last trees on Easter Island? Diamond answers with the failures to anticipate and to perceive combined with bad rational behavior. There lies the weakness of the book: while Diamond reviews environmental factors, his answers are in politics, economics and business. Successful societies had political leaders who cared about the long term. In Montana, shifting from agriculture to tourism smacks of Adam Smith's mysterious hand. A difference in two oil companies strategies made one field a failure and the second a showcase for success.<br /><br />Despite the despair permeating his observations (the first section on Montana was so depressive I almost stopped reading), Diamond's optimism lies with awareness. Yet, despite global awareness to the dangers of fossil fuels, 2005 was another record year for car sales in America. Jared Diamond asserts public pressure is the key to successful strategies, but (in my opinion) green strategies won't work without the appropriate economics incentives.nd the second a showcase for success.

B00005JOIF|5.0|...at least, that's the premise of Spielberg's latest film, Munich.<br /><br />I went with with a friend to see the movie yesterday afternoon, in Palo Alto.<br /><br />The film opens with the terrorist attack upon the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. Palestinean terrorists seize a number of Israeli athletes, some of whom are killed in the initial attack, others who are killed at the airport at the attempted getaway.<br /><br />It's the aftermath that the movie portrays. Israeli leadership calls itself to action, and sends an off-the-books assassination squad after those responsible for the attack. Their activities are restricted to terrorists located in Europe.<br /><br />  Ephraim: We have 11 Palestinian names, each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays the leader of the squad (Avner). He and his team proceed down the path of righteous retribution, with the best of intentions. But, they question their way down the path more and more as time goes along.<br /><br />  Carl: It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin.<br /><br />  Avner: Think of yourself as something else then.<br /><br />The men are to only hit the men responsible for the attacks, and avoid collateral damage, and they take this seriously, panicking when children or newlyweds stumble into the line of fire. They can also sense that, mostly off-screen, the terrorist organization they hunt is retaliating.<br /><br />In the end, when their hunt is called off, Bana finds himself a changed man. A family man, even more important to him than being an Israeli, he comes home to his wife and child, and cannot shake the sense of paranoia that has become a part of him, due to the task he'd had, and he questions the success his handlers tell him he's achieved. Terrorism has continued, actually gotten worse, with new leaders springing up in place of the fallen.<br /><br />It's an ambivalent ending...no answers are given. Why should there be? We, out here in the real world clearly don't have them.<br /><br />It's a well-executed film. Spielberg's brought his A-game to this project. In many ways, the film feels minimalist, but that's because of the squad's single-minded purpose. The film was shot on location in Paris (near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge), Hungary, Malta, and New York City, with a good effort put into making the scenery have the feel of the mid-1970s. The cast is superb, with Eric Bana leading the way. The violence is graphic, brutal, and believable.<br /><br />It's a film designed to make you think. I'd recommend y'all go see it, and think about it.e? We, out here in the real world clearly don't have them. <br /> <br />It's a well-executed film. Spielberg's brought his A-game to this project. In many ways, the film feels minimalist, but that's because of the squad's single-minded purpose.

B0002XDODU|5.0|Absolutely great! Every track on this CD is awesome. It's just \\"geil\\"! The lyrics and the music are \\"krass\\".Now in German: Ich hoffe, jeder kauft sich dieses Album und lernt dazu noch deutsch, dann versteht man die Texte!Und die hauen richtig rein! So, let's rock & roll! <br /> <br />
0156027321|4.0|The book didn't change my beliefs and it didn't make me ponder my existence on earth.  But, the book entertained me.  I took the book for what it was... a story about a boy on a life raft with some animals with a twist.  If you're looking for a fast read and some entertainment take this book for a spin.
B0000026WD|3.0|I loved Michael Jackson's first three albums.  Please do not hate me for giving this three stars. I like Michael Jackson a lot. I think he is an amazing talent even if he looks a little \\"Strange\\" these days.  Anyways, about this album...while it did have a big impact on the radio, mtv and sales it really is pretty subpar compared to his 1st three classics. \\"Black Or White\\" Had a cool video but even Michael himself said it was a \\"Throwaway track\\" from \\"Bad\\" and it even sounds like one.  There are some classic songs on here like \\"In The Closet\\", \\"Remember The Time\\", \\"Will You Be There\\" and \\"Heal The World\\" but this album just doesn't flow as well as his 1st three ones did. I felt like I've heard this before somewhere.  If you haven't bought any of Michael Jackson's albums yet get his 1st three because they are his best.
0684824906|3.0|A great piece of scholarly research, but at nearly 800 pages, Ms. Kerns over-reached, particularly in trying to weave the stories of Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, William H. Seward, and Edward Bates into a biography of Abraham Lincoln.  The emphasis in this book is on parlor politics and Lincoln's management style, but the sections dealing greatest event in U.S. history -- the Civil War -- do not deliver the impact they deserve.  When it comes to recently published biographies of U.S. presidents, I much prefer the style of David McCullough's \\"1776,\\" which focused on a single, dramatic year in the life of its charismatic subject, George Washington. Surely the story of Abe Lincoln could have been delivered in a more vivid manner.  As it is, \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a sure-cure for insomnia.  Recommended for die-hard history buffs.  Others beware.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|I have been told that I have a very old soul - much older than my actual age.  A part of why I'm told that is the fact that I love \\"Old Time Movies\\" as I call them.  I enjoy many movies being made in Hollywood today but there's just something special about an old fasioned black and white movie where you know that it's going to be family friendly.<br /><br />Two of Hollywood's best from the 1930's and 1940's star in \\"Bringing Up Baby\\": Cary Grant and Katerine Hepburn.  Cary Grant plays an uptight paleantologist that only wants the $1,000,000 donation to his museum.  Katherine Hepburn is the neice of the woman that has the $1,000,000 to donate.  How they meet and their resulting 'relationship' is pure comedey at it's best.  Screwball comedy is a term often used to describe this movie and it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />I mentioned in the title that this passed the test.  The test I'm referring to is the 'wife test'.  I enjoy 'old time movies' but my wife rarely finds that she likes one enough to watch again and again.  This movie is one of those rare movies.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I liked their first cd, didn't like the second, love this one.   It's the Strokes,  just the Strokes Plus.  I'm most impressed with the lyrics.  The music is tight and compliments everything nicely.   Also, the recording quality is much better than previous ones.   It seems like on a lot of new recordings (not just the Strokes - new White Stripes is a good example) the highs are totally stripped out.  The recording quality on this album seems better.
0316666343|4.0|A very good book but heartbreaking as well. I still can't understand how the girl came back to earth for a few hours but all in all a very good read.
B00004XOWM|1.0|What has been said about how bad Limp Bizkit is and how they totally destroyed rap-metal, nu-metal and mostly American mainstream music has already been said. Fred Durst must be the biggest jerk in music. He knows that everybody hates him, so he openly calls out other people in rock music who obviously have a lot more talent then he does. Fred Durst will rot in music hell (if there is one) along with Britney Spears and N-SYNC. But in case you are just getting into music, I have the legend of 2000, a time when music took the biggest downfall ever since hair metal... <br /> <br />In late 2000, I was 14 years old. If you were cool, you must have had Limp Bizkit's \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" and Eminem's \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". Both albums and artists sucked. I will tell you right now. But, if you were a white suburban 14 year old, you must of had these albums and must of listened to it non-stop to be cool. You also had to wear baggy jeans with your boxers hanging out, a long wallet chain and your headphones under your ears. It was just the fad. I was tempted to do this because everybody in my school was doing it. But, I was just getting into descent rock music and skipped this one because after hearing and seeing these songs on MTV and the radio, I realized how bad they really were. <br /> <br />Now, it's 5 years later and everybody who was buying and listening to Limp Bizkit realize how they helped destroy nu-metal and rap-metal. Hell, nu-metal was descent before that (System of a Down, Helmet, Faith No More) but everybody saw how Limp Bizkit made a hell of a lot of cash and copied them. Limp Bizkit destroyed nu-metal by themselves, but they started they started the destruction of rap-metal. After them, everybody was and still are a rap-metal group... and they all suck. Anthrax and Rage Against the Machine are the only rap-metal groups that count. If you confuse Rage with Limp Bizkit, then you should be destroyed. Rage Against the Machine were one of the most talented group of musicians from the 1990's. Tom Morello was 10 times a better player then Wes Borland and Zack de la Rocha's lyrics actually meant something, besides what Fred Durst says: \\"F--- this motherf---ing f---er f--- this up the motherf---ing f---.\\"  <br /> <br />That was cool in 2000, but now in 2006 people know that American mainstream music, nu-metal and rap-metal are dead and buried. The only talent left in mainstream music is the Foo Fighters, and even though I aint a fan, they have actual talent and I respect them for having such a huge fanbase and a huge influence. But now every nu-metal band is an Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam rip-off (Creed, Nickelback, Staind, Puddle of Mudd) and they all suck. And I can't even start how many bands ripped off Rage Against the Machine and are nowhere near them. Fred Durst said that he wanted to be like RATM. I got a few words of wisdom for you Fred, \\"You suck and you will never be Rage Against the Machine\\". If you want great rap-metal, pick up anything by Rage Against the Machine or Anthrax. Just avoid everything else labeled rap-metal. <br /> <br />You want a review of the CD? Just take a look at every other review for any other Limp Bizkit album and there you go. For the people who said Limp Bizkit's old albums like Three Dollar Bill Y'all and Significant Other were good... get a life and stop watching MTV. Hell, can they can be worse than Korn? At least Korn got off to a descent start. Unlike Limp Bizkit, they never had talent and never will... Thank God it is all over because they just released a Greatest Hits album!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas present for a friend who swears the movie is one of his favorite movies.  He did not have the uncut version.  After watching the uncut version, he affirms that the uncut version helps to explain more of Donnie Darko the person.
0749439483|3.0|With sections on e-mail etiquette, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, communication theory, paginating a publication and running meetings, authors Lyn Smith and Pamela Mounter attempt to cover a lot of territory in the field of internal communication. Unfortunately, they end up being overly general and diffuse. In addition, they are oriented toward the United Kingdom, and their language and some of their corporate examples assume that the reader is familiar with events there. So, this book may not be terribly useful for American readers or for those who already have experience in internal corporate communication. We recommend it to anyone who needs a primer on why internal communication is increasingly important in the corporate world.
0553801503|2.0|This is a preliminary review since I have not completed the book yet.  I'm currently about 350 pages into it and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!  Who does that remind you of?  Right now, I'm praying something significant occurs becuse I switched to George RR Martin after finally giving up on Robert Jordan.  Up until this point, everything has been great.  The first 350 pages of this book have me worried though.    What is this, some sort of fantasy soap opera? Why so much focus of Brienne?  Why so much on Cersei?  I'd care if they were doing something, but they are not.  How about Jon, Bran, and the woman with the dragons?  Heck, I don't remember her name and she hasn't even appeared in this book yet.    More to follow when I'm finished...    1/18/2006 update:  On page 352 Cersei pulls at her hair.  Uh oh... who else does that Robert Jordan fans?    1/20/2006:  I read the review by GCT \\"g8t\\" today.  Hey GCT - what do you call a 700+ page book of nothing?  I call it Robert Jordenesque.  BTW - I'm in the mid-400's now.  I skipped forward to the end and noticed a one page notice explaining why so many of the characters weren't mentioned (Danny, Tyrion, Jon, etc).  Something about the book being too long.  I didn't read the whole thing because it was too much of a spoiler.      The point is this, if you enjoy 100's of pages about Cersei plotting to get Tommen's new bride deflowed by someone else, read this soap opera.  Apparently, if you want to read about the \\"real\\" characters and \\"real\\" action, then you have to wait for the next book.    Finally, I would argue that Martin has begun repeating himself.  How many times do we have to read about someone \\"breaking their fast\\".  Just about every chapter includes mention of someone eating their breakfast.  It is either that or rape.  Someone is being raped, has been raped, heard about a rape, wants to be raped, etc.  Not that that is anything wrong with lots of breakfast and an occasional rape.  Maybe Martin will go all out in his nextbook and have someone actually raped while breaking their fast!  That would be groundbreaking work!    2/1/2006:  Well... I'm somewhere in the mid 600's now. What difference does it make????  Nothing is happening.  There was a battle that occurred somewhere.  I'd tell you about it but it took place \\"off camera\\".  Ahhhhh!!!!      Is Martin out of his mind?  Are his publishers out of their mind?  Why write a book an exclude all the main characters?  Heck, maybe Tolkein should have written a book and left the hobbits out!  Just about the same thing.      I think it is well known that this book was behind schedule.  It makes me wonder if Martin was forced to put whatever he had together just to get something on the shelves.  My guess is that the \\"good\\" stuff was incomplete, so they had to throw all the filler into one book just to publish something.      This book does Robert Jordan proud.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Wish I could have been there live.  This is an excellent show. You can tell the players in this group are still very close and respect each other.  It is very evident the Eagles still love performing, each in his own unique way. I would buy it again.  The music is fantastic, along with the vocals and some comedic twists along the way.
B0006J28KU|5.0|The best cop drama ever in my opinion.And the first on screen collaboration of two great screen legends.This epic is one of the best films of 1995.<br /><br />The film in a little words is about two groups the bad guys run by Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and the cops run by (Vincent Hanna)Al Pacino.And there eventual showdown at who is the best.We follow Neil McCauley and his crew one on their jobs.There 3 cops killed by the new guy in his crew.He is noticed by robbery homicide Lt. Vincent Hanna and his fellow officers on how good this crew is and how to take them down.Threw the film we see how these two men and how they deal with mixing personal and busniness.In the end who will win in this battle of the cops and robbers.<br /><br />The film is the most realistic cop film ive seen.And Michael Mann behind the camera elevates the material very high than other people.One of the creators of Miami Vice and another great cop film Mahunter.Here using all his talents makes a griping film.There are no scenes in this film were you feel that this couldn't happened or that looks fake.The film is true accomplishment of film.This film could have been nominated for some Oscars but was overlooked for some other films that were good.But come on you coudnt put this in Babes place.And if not this than Leaving Las Vegas.Which they also overlooked that year in Best Picture.They didn't even nominate Heat for cinematography or even sound.That just makes me sad.<br /><br />The film for its epic feel has a epic cast.Containing two greats Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.Who give great performances as they always do.But you just have to smile seeing these two guys talking to each other in the restaurant scene.But there not they good actors in this film.The supporting actors could easily be leading in a film.Like Val Kilmer or Ashley Judd.Playing a couple in the film.Val Kilmer a talented actor and to tell the truth doesn't get much recognition for his work in most of his films.Judd was stillon the rise of becoming a star when the film was released.John Voight another great member of the cast whose character is suppose to be like real criminal now actor who recently passed away Eddie Bunker.Bunker had played in Resevoir Dogs and in Steve Buscemi's Animal Factory.Also Ted Levine,Tom Sizemore,Diane Venora,Danny Trejo,Dennis Haysbert,Natalie Portman,William Fichtner to round up this phenomenal cast.And so many more like Tom Noonan and Wes Studi.Interesting fact about the cast .The love interest that Robert De Niro has in the film was originally going to be played by famous Chinese actress Gong Li.But couldn't because of scheduling conflicts.But now is in the cast of Mann's new film Miami Vice.Also Val Kilmer part was given to Keanu Reaves originaly.In my opinion better Kilmer than Reeves even though I don't dislike his acting as much as others do.<br /><br />The DVD has a audio commentary by Michael Mann.Which is good track with very good information on the film.Also the behinds the scenes on the second disc are good.The one were Michael Mann talks about the development of the script over 20 years is intresting.Also how he had a friend that was a cop and was inspiration for the script.One of the behind the scenes is were they look at the locations of the film which is a bit boring.The deleted scenes that are about eleven are ok.There isn't something from the deleted scenes that would add a bit more to the film.Most of the scenes would drag the film to a longer state.The film is already great.But you cant say the deleted scenes are terrible though.<br /><br />This a great epic.One of the best cop and robber films.This should belong in every DVD collection.Anybody who is a Pacino or Robert De Niro fan pick this up.This DVD dosent deserve second thoughts.
B000002L9J|5.0|In the mid-1980's rock was dominated by hair metal. Luckily, the Smiths emerged and became a popular act in their homeland of the U.K.. In America they developed a cult following. This is thier masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is pure-guitar pop, complete with Morrisey's unique moaning of his beautiful lyrics. Once you listen to it, you'll agree it's one of the best alternative albums ever, if not the best. Highlights include the title track, \\"Cemetry Gates\\", \\"The Boy With A Thorn in His Side\\", and the great \\"There Is  A Light That Never Goes Out\\". Get this.
0780622553|4.0|I recently saw this movie again for the first time and enjoyed it anew.  Worth a pickup. <br /> <br />However, my point in writing this is to address the complaints about the movie not being Widescreen. <br /> <br />There are two ways that studios can make a Fullscreen version of a movie.  The first is to take the movie in its standard \\"widescreen\\" aspect ratio and span back and forth to follow the action.  This is \\"Pan and Scan\\".  There is another method, however. <br /> <br />Most people are unaware that movies are often filmed at \\"fullscreen\\" ratio.  When a movie is filmed this way, the parts that the director doesn't want to include in the movie are covered over (referred to as \\"matted out\\") when the film is projected so that the unwanted elements are excluded.  The film captures everything, but the \\"widescreen\\" ratio is what the director wants the audience to see. <br /> <br />Occasionally, a studio will create a fullscreen version of movie by simply removing the matte.  More often than not, this will reveal things that the director never intended to be seen, such as boom mics and light rigs. <br /> <br />In the case of Dark City, New Line utilized this second method: they removed the matte off of the film and showed all of what was captured on film.  But it must be noted: THE FULLSCREEN VERSION IS NOT WHAT PROYAS WANTED US TO SEE. <br /> <br />Yes, the Widescreen version is simply the Fullscreen version with bars on the top and bottom.  But the Widescreen version is how the movie was projected in the theatre and exactly how Proyas wanted the movie to be seen. <br /> <br />To be honest, kudos to New Line for including both versions of the film so that people can choose the version they wish to watch without having to purchase the other separately.  But, hopefully, we will soon reach a time that people will no longer need a Fullscreen version.
0393320928|4.0|A good friend of mine turned me onto Feynman a couple of years ago with \\"Surely You Must Be Joking\\".  I just finished this one over the New Year holiday.  It's a great book! <br /> <br />I love Feynman and I love both of the two books I've read.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star book, in my opinion, is that I could swear some of the material in this book was also contained in \\"Surely You Must Be Joking\\".  I could be wrong about that, though.  They could simply be additional stories taken from the same time-frame in Feynman's life.  The first half of this book, however, seemed to be either the same or very similar as the other book.  With so many Feynman books on the shelves today, I wonder if this isn't a problem with many of the others as well. <br /> <br />The second half of this book is what really blew me away.  For the most part, the second half of this book deals with Feynman's role researching the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  Feynman's insights into beauracracy and the analogies to corporate America are spot on.  And with the 20th anniversary of the disaster almost upon us, the material seemed somewhat timely as well.
B000002HGD|4.0|I originally gave this album a five-star review, but I have changed my mind. The reason I am changing the review is because of two songs: \\"Into the Blue\\" and \\"When It's Cold I'd Like to Die\\". These songs are dreadfully boring. Trip-hop can be boring too but if it is done really well, it can at least grab your attention. However, these songs can actually put a listener to sleep. Had Moby left these two songs out and kept the other eleven, Everything is Wrong would be on par with his Play album. Seriously. \\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\\" is also a slow song, but at least it is gorgeous and captivating. The album is half fast, half slow, with four of the six fast songs being techno and the other two being hardcore punk. The fast techno songs are nearly perfect: \\"Feeling So Real\\", \\"Everytime You Touch Me\\", \\"Bring Back My Happiness\\", and \\"Anthem\\". I have no complaints about these songs whatsoever and \\"Feeling So Real\\" and \\"Bring Back My Happiness\\" rank with the greatest techno songs of all time in my opinion. The two hardcore songs, \\"What Love\\" and \\"All That I Need Is to Be Loved\\" are an acquired taste and are not for everybody's enjoyment, but I'll take those two over \\"Into the Blue\\" and \\"When It's Cold I'd Like to Die\\" any day. Two sub-par songs can definitely hurt an album if they are both four minutes or longer each and such is the case here. Still, the good moments on Everything is Wrong are great.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I devoured all the Firefly episodes and was anxious to see this movie.  I found it great for fans and for first time viewers.  It gave a quick background and then got right into the story.  I don't want to give anything away about the movie, so I will just say that the story is excellent and still leaves room for more movies or episodes that I would gladly purchase at any price!    Long Live Firefly!
B000BTC5LW|1.0|In 2010 DVDs will probably be as outdated as VCRs are.  I hope they are kidding with a 2010 release date for Pulse. What is the hold up? Legal battles with Rodger? Did David lose the master recordings? I would personal throw all my Pink Floyd DVDs, and videos in the bin and set fire to them if it meant an earlier release date for Pulse. <br /> <br />Enough is enough!    <br /> <br />1 star is the rating for the length of time it has taken for Pulse to be released on DVD not for the concert itself.  Live at Pompei and London 66 - 67 were released on DVD and they are worth one viewing and then straight into the bin.  Cmon!  If you think I am going to wait 4 more years for Pulse on DVD, guess again Pink Floyd.
B00005JLT5|5.0|not only has he made another unbelievably excellent holocaust film, but he it bears his indefinably quirky stamp.  While the basics of the film have been covered in the reviews, what struck me was that this protagonist is not some superhuman hero type, but merely a highly talented man trying to survive - he avoids fighting, relies on his elite contacts, and ventures out only when he can't avoid it.  Lots of his time is spent in solitude, waiting fearfully and introspecting.  This made him a kind of everyman, with whom I for one could identify far more than some otherwordly figure like Martin Gray, whose story of survivaly is as intimidating as it is fantastic.  This film reveals how most of us would have gone about trying to survive:  it required pluck and courage, but also luck and avoidance of danger.  The acting is also perfect.<br /><br />Also, the extra of Polanski speaking aobut his childhood - and how he survived a near-identical situation, is incredibly moving and fascinating.  This film is perhaps his most important, for himself.  One wonders what his career would have been like had he stayed in Hollywood.  I must say that, given the repertoire of films he has done since then, such as this or Tess, his first-rate talent was not diminished.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is one of the first films I will show to my children when they are ready to learn about the holocaust.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|sure the book is better and as history it stinks, but you know in hollywood they change history to suit their needs all the time. so don't think this will help your book report or your history class report,do your work and you'll be fine. now if it's good old movie magic and blood and thunder epic storytelling you want look no farther. with great cgi f/x and fine acting from brad pitt, eric banna, brian cox, and the great peter o'toole this is a fun but dark epic. this isn't for the kids though as it is rated r for a very good reason. so put the kids to bed and pop some popcorn and watch some old time movie making at it's best.

B00097A5I6|3.0|This is certainly an enjoyable listen. I own all the major Oasis releases and like them all. However, the recordings that find there way into the CD player far more often when I am in that Britpop mood, are those by the band called Ocean Color Scene. A band that deserves to be at least as huge as Oasis. Mechanical Wonder and North Atlantic Drift are truelly deserving of 5 stars, and most of their rest at least a 4. So fans, give them a try, you will like it.

B000068TPN|5.0|I was soooo glad to see how well amazon viewers reviewed We Were Soldiers.  Many critics slammed the movie when it came out for being too flag-waving and unrealistic, as well as chastising Mel Gibson for being over-the-top in his role as Hal Moore.  What they failed to understand was that the battle actually happened, and Col Hal Moore served as a technical supervisor for the film.  In the special features he specifically states that their only concern was to \\"get it right\\".  As for being \\"flag-waving\\", I have yet to discern how that is a criticism of an American war movie.  We are shocked and horrified by the events depicted on screen, and the fact that they actually happened makes them even more awful, but this movie shows us the spirit of the \\"American fighting man\\" at its best.  Lastly, I cannot fault Mel Gibson for attempting to capture the full range of emotion of one of the finest battlefield commanders in American history.  I personally think he does a terrific job, as nobody does \\"epic\\" quite as well as Mel.             <br />     Numerous Vietnam veterans have reviewed this film to testify to its realism and accuracy.  To me, that's all that needs to be said.  I bought We Were Soldiers earlier this year, have watched it probably 20 times, show it to every one of my friends who hasn't seen it yet, and it hits me harder each time.  When the battle is over and we are finally allowed to reflect on what happened, it is almost impossible not to tear up.  So kudos to Randall Wallace for having the guts to make this film and for being unabashed in his patriotism, and a heartfelt thank you to all Vietnam veterans for your courageous service.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This movie was funny, what really drew me in was the commercials with the ballroom blitz playing. That made it so much funnier. This is a great movie for someone looking for something completely insane. If you are looking for a Jackie Chan movie(Which i like) this isnt that kind of movie. This movie relies on pure comedy, and some cool effects.<br /><br />I would reccomend for anybody wanting a laugh
B000BJS4SU|2.0|I would never try to pass as a John Mayer fan, because I dislike him. I dislike his songwriting, I dislike his voice, I dislike the fact that he looks like he's falling asleep at all times... he just  does nothing for me. However, you hear a man duet with a legend like BB King, and you wonder. Unlike on modern duet CDs by Ray Charles and Herbie Hancock (the latter of which features Mayer as well), BB King's newest, simply titled \\"80\\", features him as easily the youngest musician backing the blues legend up. Only Sheryl Crow seems equally out of place. Even so, Crow and Mayer shine under BB's direction, so it led me to wonder when \\"TRY!\\" came out, might John Mayer be more talented than we expect? The answer is probably one of personal taste, but there are some things we, the musical community, need to just accept:    1) He's a good guitarist. His guitar playing may be wholly unmoving and derivative, but he knows what he's doing with the instrument. Even before this album, the man was clearly more proficient than mealy-mouthed stoner-jam peers like Dave Matthews and Jack Johnson. Saying his guitar playing is boring or overdone  or anything of that nature is fine, but saying he can't play guitar is ignorant. He can, and probably as well or better than you. However, if technique were all there was to being good, Yngwie Malmsteen would be moving music.    2)He has a weak voice. Not like Neil Young or Bob Dylan has a weak voice, but his voice is meant for sappy pop schlock. When he sings, that's all you can hear. I think this is most clear on tracks like \\"Who did you think i was?\\" where he tries to emote more. It's not his fault that his voice can't do anything more, but it's true nonetheless. I've seen the argument that it's not about the voice, it's about his prowess at the guitar, and it's true that vocals are not what make the music, but when a song is written, it needs to balance to be good. Frank Sinatra couldn't have fronted Metallica, and John Mayer, for all his attempts, shouldn't front a blues outfit.    3) This is really not a well-recorded live show. It's not the worst I've heard, and it certainly sheds a certain amount of the glossy pop-produced image he's gained, but still, you're John Mayer, spend a couple extra bucks and get a decent sound crew.    4) He tried. This is the most fitting title for a CD ever. Everything screams \\"TRY!\\" He tried to expand his musical repertoire. He tried to show that he has chops. He tried to put emotion into his music (and let's be honest, from the first, it was hard to believe a man who sounded like mayer was running through his highschool \\"screaming at the top of [his] lungs\\"). It's honest music, if mediocre. It still sounds like john mayer. It will -always- sound like John Mayer, because it is. This is going to hone his fan base. It's not going to expand it dramatically, nor will it ostracise teenyboppers looking for new mayer to swoon over. It will, however, bring him a step closer to finding a fan base that actually cares about his music without caring that they're listening to something wimpier (or in some cases, more musically proficient) than they normally would. This is, as Mayer writes, an attempt to \\"try to be myself again\\". You can tell listening to this that this is the best he can do, and even if it wasn't radio friendly, this would be what he wanted to put out. That's noble. Even if it's also bad.
0679601686|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I was one of those people who thought King Kong was a mistake for director Peter Jackson.  Fresh from his monumental success and Academy Awards with his work on The Lord of the Rings, I wasn't confident that he would make an equally, much less surpassively, good film.  I was proven wrong.<br /><br />Running at a horrendously intimidating 187 minutes, I had my fears that there would be parts where cinematographic drags would consume my interest in the film, especially since there were several such moments in Fellowship of the Ring which Jackson also directed.  However, I was pleased to find that dragging moments were limited and the whopping runtime was put to good use... so take care of your bladders prior to watching.<br /><br />I have heard many complaints regarding the first third of the film which takes place in depression-era New York city.  It is in this third where the titular beast is nowhere to be seen, but we are introduced to all the other main characters.  I have argued many times that a film is not without it's characters and so far in his blockbuster career, Peter Jackson has not disappointed in characterization.  It keeps the audience in the hearts and minds of everything that happens onscreen and therefore maintains an engaging atmosphere.  All in all, you care about all the fuss and you watch and wait, with interest, for the next scene to unfold.  Therefore, in spite of the gargantuan runtime, I was riveted to the screen.<br /><br />Carl Denham (Jack Black... yes, Jack Black) is a struggling filmmaker whose career has been so far almost successful.  When he learns his latest film is about to be scrapped, he escapes with his film and crew to continue production.  He then learns his lead actress has quit and runs into an out-of-luck vaudeville entertainer, Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), who he manages to recruit.  He convinces his cast and ship crew that they will be heading for Singapore to film.  In reality, he is heading for the mysterious Skull Island whose location he had acquired just as mysteriously.  However, his production woes continue as his script is unfinished.  He then takes popular theater writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to continue the script while the ship sails for Skull Island.  Upon reaching the island, they encounter murderous natives who wish to offer Ann to the gigantic beast they worship, Kong.<br /><br />George Lucas once said that special effects are there to aid the telling of a story and should not be the emphasis of a film.  Whether or not Lucas himself adheres to this philosophy is debatable, but it is clear that Jackson does.  There is not one scene, real or digitally created, in this movie that does not have meaning.  There is the scene of a shared sunset between Ann and Kong with volumes of depth.  It is this scene, to this reviewer, that escalated the film from ordinary blockbuster to movie greatness.<br /><br />Yes, there have been previous King Kong films.  But where they fail is where Peter Jackson's take shines.  There is an actual relationship between Kong and Ann, we actually understand why Ann cares so much for him.  While Kong would try to impress her with roars and beating his chest, Ann would perform her vaudeville antics (to Kong's.. and ultimately the audience's delight).  It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong.  Ann perhaps realizes that she is Kong's only friend, and hence his entire world.<br /><br />It is the relationship between Ann and Kong that Jackson decided to concentrate his full filmmaking abilities and rightfully so.  Yes, there is another sort-of love story between Ann and Jack Driscoll but not one that would outshine the focus of the film.<br /><br />As for the other actors, they were top-notch.  I have heard others say Jack Black was frightfully miscast but I think otherwise.  His over-the-top acting fits perfectly for Carl, a filmmaker with so much passion for his film that he continually tries to sell it to everyone just so they \\"get it\\".<br /><br />King Kong, I would have to say, is one of the best films of the year.  Entirely engaging and a delightful and sometimes frightening adventure, it is one with definite heart.  From vaudeville opening to heart-wrenching denoument, Jackson has made a film that beats on it's chest and roars.ontinually tries to sell it to everyone just so they \\"get it\\". <br /> <br />King Kong, I would have to say, is one of the best films of the year.

My only problem with it and i am sorry to say, Shia Labeouf's voice just didnt work. You get use to it after a while but it just doesnt work for the character. Sorry Shia...
0393317552|1.0|This book makes the point that geography is important, and that also living in large communities and cities is also important. This is true. <br /> <br />What Jared has missed is natural selection... that 5,000 years of living in a more complex social environment has meant that the Europeans advanced genetically as their environment advanced. The europeans who survived, were the more intelligent, the more social, more politically machaivellian and the more immune ones.  <br /> <br />It is a chicken-and-egg situation. Jared refuse to aknowledge that other racial groups (such as africans) stopped evolving because their culture and environment stayed the same and didn't drive change.  <br /> <br />Or, to put it another way, Africans today are just as stupid as europeans were 5,000 years ago. But European society kept changing and this has forced people to advance too.  <br /> <br />This book is politically correct half-truths and polemic that is tedious to read and fails to follow through to its logical conclusions.  <br />

B00005JO17|3.0|I remember the old fables and fairy tales... never cry \\"wolf!\\" and never cry \\"the sky is falling!\\"  Unless of course it really is happening...<br /><br />Chicken Little (Zach Braff) brought the town of Oakey Oaks into chaos one day when a piece of the sky fell on his head.  The resulting panic wreaked havoc on the town and later, his father Buck Cluck (Gerry Marshall), deduced that an acorn fell on his son's head, not a \\"piece of the sky\\".  This made Chicken Little the laughing stock of the town.<br /><br />A year later, his reputation still unchanged, Chicken Little tries to forget the ordeal he went through and to move on with his life.  This chicken really is as little as his name implies but he has ingenuity and resourcefulness as his allies as he goes through the big world around him.  He is seldom without his best friends at his side, fellow outcasts from the schoolyard: Fish Out Of Water (who has a diver's helmet on... only with the water inside it), Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) who has the moniker \\"ugly duckling\\" and is obsessed with teen duck fashion magazines, and Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) a gargantuan piglet always on the edge of panic.<br /><br />Things seem to be going well at one point for the fiesty Chicken Little until a piece of the sky falls on him once again...<br /><br />The film's use of CGI has proven one thing... Disney can make a film look as good as anything Pixar can put out.  The detail and charming design of the characters and Oakey Oaks itself is a marvel to behold.  But it isn't the great effects that made us fall in love with Pixar's characters, it's the heart behind it all.  Here Disney does well, as it does with all it's animated films, but just not with as much impact as it's Pixar-produced movies.  But with that nitpick aside, I fell in love with the film.<br /><br />The film put what might the mouse house has on it's magical fingertips without the Lucas-made Pixar powers to help it and it used all it's tried and tested formulas to concoct a gorgeously colorful world and in effect an entertaining film that shouldn't disappoint.<br /><br />Oakey Oaks itself has a lot of entertaining things to look at, almost pretty much a distraction from what the audience should be paying attention to.  When Chicken Little and his father were having an important character-establishing discussion while driving home from his school, the background shenanigans going on outside the car took most of my attention, often with laughs.  But what I missed was important.  Buck Cluck just doesn't believe in his son and wouldn't support him in his dreams.<br /><br />Like any good fable, Chicken Little has a moral story.  Chicken Little went beyond his physical capabilities and his past to acheive a goal that no one believed he could accomplish, including his father.  Buck Cluck should always listen to his son, and more importantly, believe in him and support whatever goal he sets out to win.<br /><br />The characters are well-designed and obviously ready for the Disney barrage of marketing.  Zach Braff's voice for the titular character seemed a little off-place at first but somehow it all fit in as the film rolled on (I would now prefer him over the original candidate, Holly Hunter).  Joan Cusack was almost instantly recognizable.  Patrick Stewart has a surprising (and short) role as the school teacher (\\"Baa!\\") but the best cameo of all is Adam West (yes, the original TV Batman) using all his cheesy line-delivery in a bulked-up finale to the film.<br /><br />In the end, it seemed Disney had an idea, went with it, and mixed up a film with spectacular visuals and just enough heart to rise above mediocrity.

055380457X|3.0|This book is OK but I must admit I haven't finished it yet. While some chapters are quite engaging and contain good informaton, there are some that seem to be thrown in for filler and are almost entirely unrelated to Google. There is no real inside dirt as the information has been gathered from sources other than Google and its founders. It's, as I said, OK.  <br /> <br />If I had my time over again I wouldn't buy the hardcover. Certainly not at the 30 odd Australian dollars I paid for it. Until something better comes along, it might be worth buying the paperback.

And when you mix the music and the movie together it`s really a damn good job.  <br />This composer has really worked hard to get this soundtrack the way it is, and the theme for the pirates are just amasing. Enyone hwo dosen`t like this soundtrack is C-R-A-I-S-Y! And I meen it too. You just have to love it when you hear it.  <br />
0553212478|4.0|I grew up seeing Frankensteins on windows and as costumes during the Halloween season, but never did I know, until now, that Frankenstein in the novel is the man who created this abomination from body parts and some electricity, and this plot makes for an intriguing novel...certainly different than the popular images/movies of Frankenstein, and perhaps even better.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein grows up thirsty for knowledge and with a penchant for the dark arts.  He is studying at a university when he creates the monster that everyone knows today as Frankenstein, although in reality he is never named.  The creature stands at eight-feet-tall and is grotesque in form.  Horrified, Victor runs away, and soon the creature leaves the building to wander the earth.  The creature is never far from Victor's tormented mind.<br /><br />Later, as the naive creature is repeatedly scorned and shunned by humans, he murders Victor's beloved friends and family, beginning with his brother William.  Victor is guilt-ridden because the accused is innocent, and he knows that his own creation was the one who strangled the boy.  Victor's health deteoriates so he retreats to the mountains, only to come face to face with the creature.  There, he learns of the monster's isolation from humanity and its yearn for companionship, but Victor never really does anything about it, which leads only to more tragedy.<br /><br />The storyline is amazing; Shelley wrote this when she was only a teenager.  Yes, the language is a bit too flowery at parts; for example, the monster has extensive, absurd vocabulary and conversations that I find a bit laughable, but flowery language was not unusual in the 19th century.  I could definitely picture in my mind Victor's emaciated self (the mad scientist look), the monster's anger --he should be like Adam of the Bible but he is not--, and all Victor's beloved die off, one by one.  Great classic read, if you can get past the verbose writings :)
B000089RVX|3.0|it's a good cd, with some good songs, but each song is very similar to eachother, kind of like the strings in a guitar.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Admittedly, i did not fall in love with every song in this album, and personally, I prefer The Bends to OK Computer, but there are undeniably emotion-grabbing lyrics and melodies in nearly every song.  Karma Police is one of my all-time favorite songs and this album is the best display of their ability to mix esoteric harmonics with catchy guitar rock and soul-searching ballads (what other album can combine songs like Airbag, Electioneering, and No Surprises).  It is one of the best albums I've ever listened to for sure.
B000AP04FG|3.0|John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) unbeknownst to each other, are assassins who have entered into a marriage of convenience. The twist is that neither of them knows of the secret life of the other. This complicated their lives (imagine the lies that each must tell the other) but also puts a strain on their marriage. Their day lives are vastly more exciting than their very polite and very perfunctory after-hours existence.<br /><br />This tension and complexity makes the first half of the movie fun and unpredictable. But as soon as the assassins learn of each others' identity, the movie bogs down into a standard shoot-em-up with lots of acrobatics, close calls, impossible escapes, big guns and loud explosions.<br /><br />The extras include somewhat interesting material about problems encountered during shooting, including a couple of \\"mistakes\\" (Pitt running into the wrong section of a breakaway fence) that made it into the film.<br /><br />Still, the writing in the second half could have been less predictable. Too bad. The first half had so much going for it.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Perfect Strangers was Deep Purple's reunion album from 1984, with the classic Mk II lineup.<br /><br />It was the perfect reply to Led Zeppelin's In Through The Outdoor of 1979. Perfect Strangers could be one of their best works. If not, it's certainly their most rounded, at least until 2005`s Rapture of the Deep. It's a rock album from start to finish, and really, they never sounded so good together. Anchoring the album are 2 songs, \\"Knockin' At Your Back Door\\", and the title track. Both are rooted firmly in the Purple hard rock plan. They're extensive, hulking groaners that allow Ritchie Blackmore the freedom to play his guitar. Jon Lord's organ adds the glue that holds the band together, giving us something to pay attention to while there are breaks in the action. The organ is most powerful on \\"Mean Streak\\". It's a throwback to the primitive energy of their olden days. But it's also here that we see exactly what Deep Purple really is: a rhythm band. Bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice keep the whole thing grooving, while Lord's keys and Blackmore's guitar insert accents of zing. Gillian's voice sits atop all this, telling a story of a intoxicated girlfriend. On \\"Hungry Daze\\" we hear influences acquired during the band's time off. Gillian's voice, at times, sounds like his stint with Black Sabbath. Blackmore adds guitar work that reminds me of Rainbow. The next track is \\"Not Responsible\\" Gillian's \\"funk you\\" anthem, where he explains that he'll do anything he wants, and accept no responsibility for his actions.<br /><br />Perfect Strangers was a atypical album for Deep Purple. Never had the band sounded so cohesive. Never had they managed such a consistent sound over an entire album. Perhaps that's why they called the album Perfect Strangers. Maybe they were five musicians, so diverse that they were strangers to each other in fact. Infinitely different people, that complimented each other perfectly. A piece of pure magic in my opinion.<br /><br />Highlights: Knockin' At Your Back Door, Under The Gun, Perfect Strangers, Gypsy's Kiss and Wasted Sunsets.<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure you get the Polydor version of this disc and not the 1999 Mercury/Universal version re-master, it just seems to breath better in my humble opinion.ack Door, Under The Gun, Perfect Strangers, Gypsy's Kiss and Wasted Sunsets.

B000002N1E|5.0|This is one of those Prince recordings where everything worked. There is not a song here that can't stand on its own. It's amazing throughout--which is why it's so hard to find. Overall, this is by far the Prince cd to own, definitely a must buy!
B000667FN8|5.0|This album has a lot of depth to it. Like the songs 'Welcome To My Life' what mostly every teen goes through these days, 'Crazy' the truth about what's going on in the world, 'Untitled' talks about drunk driving and really opens your eyes to that topic and makes you think, 'Shut Up' proving that you can say what you want and it's not going to get to you, and my personal favorite 'Me Against The World' talking about being yourself. There's the debate out there about what's \\"Punk\\" Does it really honestly matter? This CD is great. Sure Simple Plan's music is a but more poppyish, but that really doesn't matter. Honestly does the genre, or the way it sounds matter? Sure it's different from their debut album 'No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls' but that's what made me love it. The guitars, the drums, the lead vocals of Pierre Bouvier, and the back-up vocals of David Desrosiers and Sebastien Lefebvre make this album outstanding. I bought it the day it came out and listened to it as soon as I could. The only words I could utter was 'Wow', and to this day I still utter that word, because honestly I could never get tired of listening to it, and this really is one of the best albums i've ever heard.

0553213105|5.0|Books i dont think ever get better than this. I recently saw the movie that came out in november and i immeditaly fell in love with the story.  I love how this book shows a true romance story. In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it. However the words that are used can be quite hard to understand sometimes without having been exposed to words ,and phrases that are said differently, before. Over all it has become one of my favorite books and Jane Austen did a exceptionally good job at writing this.
B000001DTM|4.0|After the release of the \\"Rattle And Hum\\" album, I don't think anybody including the band could have imagined this was next. Talk about entering the 90's with a bang. \\"Achtung Baby\\" not only changed the musical course of the group for the next decade, it's argueably their best album, which is saying alot. Amazing tracks like \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Mysterious Ways\\", are the best known, but my favorites are the rockin' opener \\"Zoo Station\\", \\"So Cruel\\", and \\"The Fly\\". This is truly one of the great front-to-back albums, and I believe a great example of a risk paying off big-time. I can honestly say that I love every album of theirs, but if they ever topped \\"The Joshua Tree\\", it was with this disc right here. I'll probably listen to it \\"Until The End Of The World\\".
B00005JOFO|5.0|A beautifully crafted film with excellent performances from the whole cast, especially Ledger.  A tragic love story as well, and I'm impressed with how closely the screenplay follows the short story--which I also recommend.  I never looked at my watch the whole time I was in the theatre--and believe me, that's getting tougher to do these days with all the mediocre movies that come out. <br />
0307276902|1.0|When I read this book and having some familiarity with addiction, I was astounded at the untruths and far-out exaggerations contained in this self-professed victim's fairy taleThe outlandish performance at the dentist's,his unlikely physical state on the plane,his tough-guy posture,his being left off the hook for serious infractions. He might be a rich-boy alcoholic but a heroin addict he's not,simply because his behavior does not fit the role.Like others,he has exploited this society's infatuation with drugs to make an easy buck. For an authentic ,yet humble read,throw this junk away and find a copy of Three-Dog Nightmare. Guaranteed,it's the real deal!

B00092ZMDY|3.0|Don't get me wrong - this is a good DVD, and contains all of the Eagles hits, BUT (1) Glenn Frey's voice has gone.  He's too old to hit these notes now.  (2) Lead guitarist Don Felder is missing, having been kicked out by Henley & Frey a few years back (3) the arrangements are dodgy - they have replaced Felder with a fiddler and a horrible horns section.  Take my advice and buy the Hell Freezes Over DVD instead.  It was recorded in 1994, and the Eagles are all together and sound much better.  OK, HFO doesn't include many of the classics like Lyin' Eyes and Peaceful, easy feeling, but it's still a much better collection of songs, including the unreleased acoustic \\"Heart of the Matter\\" and the anti-PC \\"Get over it\\".  It's time the Eagles retired.  I'd hate for them to become a laughing stock like the Rolling Stones.
0694526088|5.0|I'm in the process of opening up a new business, and with this book on cd in hand - I have both my inspiration, and guidelines on not just how to do it - but how to *think* through the process of what I'm embarking upon. I wont beat the dead horse about what people have outlined - there's some awesome reviews here - and part of the reason I bought this in the first place. But what I personally found most interesting about this book on cd is the straightforward, no b.s. approach to evidence and support of just what makes great companies tick - and how they got there in the first place. Mr Collins even goes so far to provide many examples of this same exact strategy he's discovered being used successfully in companies - in anything from sports, small business, and even personal lives. This isn't so much a book on how to run a business, as it is a how to run your life and mind, and quite simply focus with passion on everything you do. From an outsider's perspective, those words at first seem obvious. But listening to the stories detailed throughout this book - it truly is inspiring to hear what works, and what doesnt in truly great individuals and lives who have made a difference, and have had fulfilling lives as well despite living 'below the radar' and understanding humility is something which comes naturally when you lead by your passions, not for everyone else's. A HIGHLY recommended read (or listen), and I can say this is one of the few books of this type which I will NOT be reselling - GO FIND YOUR OWN COPY!!! ;-)

B00005JOII|5.0|Woody Allen in his latest movie, the devastatingly entertaining Match Point, he explores the whims of misfortune, the vagaries of right and wrong. The movie is an extraordinarily bleak look at the moral morass of betrayal, illicit sex, hypocrisy, and crime. What a tangled web of secrets and lies that we weave, at least one would think so after watching this beautifully acted and marvelously paced movie.     Relying on several crucial characters, some great London locations and precise storytelling, without a shot or line of dialogue wasted, Allen has created a perfect chamber piece, an intense and elegant look at sexual infidelity, and the price one ultimately pays for having deceptively good or even bad luck; it's all just a fortuitous role of the dice, the unforeseen luck of the game in Match Point.     How much is one willing to give up one's exclusive lifestyle for love? Chris Wilson (a phenomenal Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is presented this question as he steadily becomes involved with the wealthy Hewett family. Chris has just been offered a job as tennis pro at a prominent English club when he befriends one of his clients, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). After a friendly practice session, Tom discovers that Chris is an opera lover and is invited to share an evening out with his rich family.     Chris soon charms Tom's mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), his father Alec (Brian Cox) and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and after obtaining a job in Alec's company, steadily becomes accustomed to his newfound life of privilege. The lovely and sweet Chloe makes it known that she's rather enamored of Chris and they soon embark on a romantic relationship.     But Chris is almost instantaneously attracted to Tom's sexy American girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Chris soon becomes infatuated with Nola and, despite continuing his relationship with Chloe, eventually persuades her to sleep with him. Nola initially scoffs at his later advances, and later she breaks up with Tom and also leaves London, but a chance meeting a few years later with Chris re-ignites the same old passions.      Chris is now forced to carry on a clandestine affair with Nola, to juggle the demands of his high-powered job and also continue in his duties to the Hewett family. He cares for his wife and enjoys the lifestyle the family affords him, but Chloe is constantly on at him to get her pregnant, yet he really does love Nola. Circumstances ultimately force him to make a difficult choice between maintaining his financial security and giving it all up for true love.     While this story isn't anything new - the tribulations of infidelity have been told time and again in various forms - what makes Match Point so great is Allen's tightly focused direction. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the story is very well laid out and planned, and builds very slowly, keeping the viewer guessing, so one never really knows where the story is heading.     Kudos should also go to Allen that he can imbue such finely wrought performances out his sexy ensemble of young actors. Rhys-Meyers and Johansson play Chris and Nola as somewhat downtrodden by their adopted upper-class family. Both are kindred spirits from the wrong side of the tracks, and while Chris unhesitatingly buys into the wealth and prestige, Nola is somewhat cynical and diffident towards Hewett family.     Scarlet Johansson gives a fiercely sexy, dynamic, and feverishly sensual performance as Nola. Provocative, saucy, edgy, and vulnerable, she's a mass of conflicting emotions. She's hesitant to become involved with Chris again, but when she does, she throws care to the wind, and becomes a desperate, needy and chaotic emotional mess.     Emily Mortimer is also terrific Chloe. Given perhaps the harder role to play, Ms. Mortimer imbues Chloe with a whiney sweetness. Chloe is obviously a product of her class; she's good-natured, and kindly but also a bit snottish. She's pleased to fall in love with a man not of her class andthinks herself blessed by his ostensible affection.    But Match Point ultimately belongs to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers who is a revelation as Chris. As the loving son in-law and the dutiful husband, Meyers infuses Chris with a serene faade, but there's always an abundance of cunning desires. He's the working class outsider who will resort to any lengths to fit in, but his persistently good nature holds a passive aggressive streak that is ultimately deceptive.     Match Point is suffused with a glow of bittersweet romance and ruefulness among the elite, English upper class, and Allen has more than nailed their grandiloquence and aristocratic pretensions.  Maybe that explains why Allen's work as writer and director seems here to be more engaged and energetic than it has in years. Indeed, if it weren't for the distinctive graphic style of the credits and the scratchy records on the soundtrack, most viewers probably wouldn't even realize that they're watching a Woody Allen movie, it's all so dark and morally bankrupt.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This album is very impressive. To say that one does not like the Strokes' \\"new sound\\" is to admit a total ignorance to the real nature of this album. The guitar work is very impressive and seems sometimes even to draw from the metal tradition (most notably on Razorblade). Vision of Division is a masterpiece, with great guitar layering and a solo in the middle that is incredible. But the Strokes have retained their sense of minimalism, and though it is used more sparingly, \\"Ask Me Anything\\" and \\"On the Other Side\\" employ the technique quite well. <br />     I have always felt that as a vocalist, Casablanca is only satisfactory. On this album, however, he utilizes his range more fully and the effect is more compelling than his oft-monotonous performance on \\"Is This It\\". <br />     Unfortunately, this album is doomed to be underrated. A combination of hipster naysaying (\\"Man, the Strokes just aren't what they used to be!\\") and a hit single that is as close to mediocre as the album comes (\\"Juicebox\\") has clipped the wings of this very innovative and enjoyable record.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|1. How do you do 9/10 i like the use of the lords prayer and other relgious songs in it. pretty uninspiring title..and i don't like the message. being a christian, but i like the way it sounds. <br />2.

B000002UUX|5.0|This is classic metal here. The 2nd best thrash album ever, slightly below Slayer's 'Reign in Blood'. I'd say that Judas Priest's 'Painkiller' is better but it isn't really thrash (it's NWOBHM style mixed with speed/thrash). It got out in 1990 and it is the 1st album with the \\"classic\\" Megadeth lineup which is going to break in 1998, it looks like this:    Dave Mustaine - Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitars  Marty Friedman - Lead Guitars  Nick Menza - Drums   David Ellefson - Bass     Marty Friedman is IMO the best guitarist this band ever had. Don't get me wrong, Chris Poland & Jeff Young were great but Marty was slightly better. Nick is also better than Chuck Behler & Gar Samuelson (RIP). I'm also starting to get sick of people bashing Mustaine's voice, so he may not be Rob Halford but still his voice is great. If you wanna bash some vocalist bash Chris Martin, he sucks ass, Mustaine doesn't. This album is also the last real thrash metal album they had, all the later albums are going to be more pop/metal than thrash but they still kick ass, except for 'Risk' which just sucked and anything, they made in that era, although they tried to make a return to form with 'The System Has Failed' in 2004, But I'll be fair, they kinda succeed there. Okay back onto the album, the best song here is the opening track, 'Holy Wars... The Punsihment Due', it is BY FAR Megadeth's best song ever! One of the best songs of all-time. The riffs are great the story also, and my favorite part is the solo in the end, worths alone the price of the album. The title track, 'Tornado of Souls', 'Take No Prisoners' and 'Hangar 18' are other highlights. 'Hangar' is probably my 2nd favorite (next to Holy Wars), it has 11 kick ass solos on it and it runs only about 5 mins. All the songs here are great but those I mentioned I like at best.   This is easily Megadeth's best release, it's their heaviest and thrashiest. It's one of the few albums on the site which have over 200 reviews with a 5 star average and truly deserves it. 'Peace Sells' comes very close 2nd.    A classic album. You must buy!!
1592400876|2.0|The embarrassing grammatical mistakes within Lynne Truss' book have already been well documented (starting with the missing hyphen on the front cover subtitle,) but it is two other things that cause me to mark-down this volume as a two-star book.<br /><br />First: the prose is hopelessly hyperactive. Truss seems so determined to prove that our glorious language can convey personality that her energetic prose becomes simply wearisome. Truss adopts the tone of a ham-actor so caught up in showing off her technique (breath control, pauses, frantic gesturing,) that she literally breaks the illusion and loses the plot. What is it with her use of commas? Why so many? She waves them around like an Oscar Wilde stage dame waves a fan during an attack of the vapours.<br /><br />Second, and worse, is her insidious snobbery about the whole business of grammar. Sure; grammar is a tool that helps create clarity. But having treated us to her breathless personality she unfortunately makes us  privy to her unmitigated snobbery. Pity the poor kid who misses an apostrophe off a sign at her local supermarket. You can practically hear Truss sneering at the lad. Her zero-tolerance seems directed as much at people as at their grammatical slips.<br /><br />I don't find the book humorous so much as sarcastic. Clearly a lot of readers are happy to be taken into Lynne's world of grammarian snobbery. I'm not one of them. [[ASIN:0205313426 The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition]] keeps things simple, clear and baggage-free. Eats Shoots & Leaves is a diatribe rather than a user-guide. There are better more entertaining books if you want entertainment (how about [[ASIN:1400034779 The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Book 1)]]?) and if you seek a grammar guide, then there are far more succinct and user-friendly volumes available.

B000002NJS|5.0|After a four year break, Madonna releases her seventh studio album, \\"Ray Of Light\\". Her best was still yet to come because 2000's \\"Music\\" is the best Madonna album in my opinion. Despite this,  Ray Of Light is very lyrically based and stranger and more complex than any of her other albums. This album is very diverse at it features, brilliant climaxes, mixed influences and is an alternation between many different genres of music (pop, dance, techno, alternative, world etc.)<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Drowned World / Subtitite For Love\\", which was the albums third single in the UK, peaking at #10. It starts out with simple long synthesiser notes, and soon explodes into a loud dance track as Madonna sings for the final time: 'The face of you / My substitute for love....' The second song, Swim, is better than the first. It has a dreamy beat and a very serious subject matter, and is one of my favourites of this album. \\"Ray Of Light\\" is a track I didn't like at first, but I love it now. Like the first two tracks, it starts out very simple (this time with a guitar), and then leads into a fun dance track. \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" is another song that grew on me. It is a dark song with an excellent climax, but the albums peak is the weird, dark., and complex \\"Skin\\". It reminded me of Dannii Minogues \\"Everything Changes Underwater\\" (which you have never heard of, I know) but that is a different review. It is a very techno-based song, but also features some Latin influences and it is the longest song on the album, lasting for nearly 6-and-a-half minutes.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is the albums fourth and final single. It is a reflection on Madonna's childhood, and a great dance song. \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is a common fan-favourite, but I personally think it seems to drag on a bit. \\"Shanti / Ashtangi\\" is the albums lowpoint, and most fans will agree. It is just a little boring and repeatative, although it is very complex - there are many little things to listen out for, which will not keep you bored. \\"Frozen\\" is my second favourite song and the albums first single. It got to #2 in the UK, and was very very successful throughout all of Europe and America. \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" is a song than many fans love. I think compared to most Madonna songs, it is good but not great. \\"To Have And Not To Hold\\" is a dark techno song. It is very dreamy and atmospheric. \\"Little Star\\" is a song I didn't really like at first, but I love it now. It iwas written for Madonna daughter. \\"Mer Girl\\" is another of my favourites. It is the albums most inaccessble, and closes the album beatifully.<br /><br />9.5 / 10<br /><br />Althogh most this album isn't very, let's just say it was unlike all pop music in 1998, Madonna had again changed the mainstram, and Ray Of Light sold 14 million copies worldwide.t for, which will not keep you bored. \\"Frozen\\" is my second favourite song and the albums first single.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Although I missed twenty minutes of the movie, it was a very interesting to watch. I didn't get up to get any popcorn or even use the bathroom. This movie got me interested in the relationship between two men out in the wilderness because of their jobs. They found instant attraction with one another. However, their love is tested when they leave Brokeback Mountain and resume normal lives through marriage, work and children. Ennis is traumatized by the death of a man who was dragged by his genitals to instill fear in young men and boys about homosexuality which paralyzes him from giving the love that Jack wants from him.  <br />Jack, who is married with a son and living the American dream, lives in utopia. He wants to have a real relationship with Ennis but it can never happen. Society forbids homosexuality and Ennis builds a wall around himself that prevents him from emotional expression. <br />It was shocking for Ennis' wife to discover her husband kissing his friend. I can imagine how she feels. No woman wants to know that her husband is cheating on her, especially with a man.  <br />This was a great movie to watch. It was hard for men to keep their sexuality a secret during that period. Although times have changed, there are still some men that choose to hide their sexuality from their families for fear of shame and embarassment.
B000002U9E|5.0|\\"Hounds Of Love\\", as you know, is Kate's fifth album. As you also know, it is split into two sections. The first section consists of five songs which are quite accessible compared to Kate's previous/future works, and four of them were released as singles. The second section is entited \\"The Nith Wave\\", which features some of Kate's best and original songs.<br /><br />The CD begins with the classic \\"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\\". It is probably Kate's second famous song (behind Wuthering Heights). It peaked at #2 in the UK and is a very dreamy song with a great video. Next,, is the catchy, Hounds Of Love, which I believe is another classic. It only got to #18 in the UK, but I believe it is better than the previous track. \\"The Big Sky\\" is next, and was the albums fourth and final single. It is another catchy, accessible song, and is another song I absolutealy love. \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\" is the only song from the first five tracks which was not released as a single. It is a dark song with a very serious subject matter. Track 5 is another single and only got to #20 in the UK. I say only because is it the albums second single, and compared to the success of the first single, it was not very successful at all. It is another classic though, and a fan-favourite with a great album.<br /><br />The second section \\"The Ninth Wave\\" is my favourite section as a whole as the first five tracks are great individually but kind of blur when played together. \\"And Dream Of Sheep\\" to me sounds very Tori Amos inspired, and she covered at one of her concerts recently. Although it it not one of my favourites on the album, it is a very beautiful and dreamy ballad and one of Kate's finest songs lyrically, in my opinion. \\"Under Ice\\" is a track that I thought was only so-so at first but it has somehow became my third favourite on this album. It is haunting and dark (I love the lyric and the way Kate sings lines like 'the river is overflowing') She really is a genious.  \\"Waking The Witch\\", which alternaties between the slow first two minutes or so and the fast bit that follows, which is a debate whether a certain witch really is a witch. \\"Watching You Without Me\\" is very inaccessible which many fans quote as being one of the lowpoints of the album but I disagree.<br /><br />\\"Jig Of Life\\", for me, is Kate's best song, with \\"The Dreaming\\", which is also a masterpiece. I love absloutely everything about it! \\"Hello Earth\\" is another standout (okay, there are many standouts). It is another alternation between a slow ballad to a choir singing long notes. Very strange indeed. The album finishes with the loiud, pleasent, short, happy \\"The Morning Fog\\", and finishes the album on a high.<br /><br />10 / 10<br /><br />I still think \\"The Dreaming\\" is Kate Bush's best album, and one of my top-5 favourites of all time, \\"Hounds Of Love\\" is a close second. I strongly recommend this album to any intelligent music fan.

0786856297|1.0|The engaging and well-crafted main storyline in this novel earns it one star. The underlying message loses four stars. Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father. She still loves him but purposefully marries a slob, using him as a cover for her son. Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother. I can forgive his short-sightedness - he is a kid. Unfortunately, the author of this book is not.

B00006JU7T|4.0|One of the more underrated performances of Al Pacino's gifted early career, SERPICO was filmed in between THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER, PART TWO, and was quickly followed by another incredible performance in DOG DAY AFTERNOON.<br /><br />Pacino plays frank Serpico, a New York cop who couldn't be bought. Based on the biography SERPICO by Peter Maas, Producer Martin Stegman and Director Sidney Lumet capture perfectly the gritty realities of Frank Serpico's tenure with New York's Finest, when for a time it seemed that Serpico was alone in his refusal to take graft and his resistance to the system that allowed it to flourish. Other cops hated him. These qualities nearly cost Serpico his life, as he went to the New York Times to expose police corruption.<br /><br />The film is an artifact of its era (the early Seventies) and maintains a steady but not frenetic pace. SERPICO's visual and stylistic influence can be clearly seen in such TV cop dramas as the old KOJAK, and today's LAW & ORDER and NYPD BLUE.<br /><br />Pacino embodies Serpico's mix of innocence, frustration and impotent rage at the machine even more effectively than Maas's book does. He also plays out Serpico's rather unconventional Sixties lifestyle to the hilt, a lifestyle that made Serpico a pariah amongst his fellows. Watch carefully: The \\"be-in\\" party scene beautifully foreshadows Pacino's performance as SCARFACE Tony Montana in the Club Babylon ten years later, and Pacino's depiction of Serpico's assumption of disguises (as a junkie, a deliveryman, and a Hasidic rabbi) are moments of humor in what is overall a rather grim biopic.<br /><br />Serpico was eventually shot in the face by a pusher while on narcotics detail, and lay unattended and bleeding profusely while his fellow cops went after the perpetrator. Although he survived, he left the force and retired overseas, having spurred the Knapp Commission to investigate police corruption.<br /><br />The DVD has merely obligatory special features. Martin Bregman's retrospective is so monotone that it induces sleep, and Lumet's commentary is too short and insubstantial to keep the viewer's attention. Fortunately, Pacino does a phenomenal job, and that, after all is the centerpiece of this DVD.one that it induces sleep, and Lumet's commentary is too short and insubstantial to keep the viewer's attention.

0393317552|4.0|THE BIG QUESTION [Jameson Thottam] <br /> <br />OK let's get philosophical shall we? Why are we here? Is there life after death? How did it all begin? These can be described as the A-list questions for humanity since we developed enough intelligence to stop sitting around picking fleas off each and think about such things. A slightly less fundamental question (a B-list question!) but one which probably has much more bearing on our everyday lives and our interaction with other people from different cultures, is `How did we get from clever apes to where we are today?' And as a follow up- `Why did a one section of humanity manage to impose itself over the rest?'  <br /> <br />This is what Jared Diamond attempts to answer in this fascinating book. On the front of my edition it states that this is `A Short History Of Everybody For The Last 13,000 years' and this is exactly right.  <br /> <br />HOW DID WE GET HERE? [Jameson L Thottam] <br /> <br />Diamond starts by looking at the modern world and asking how is it that Eurasian civilization came to dominate the native American, African or Polynesian civilizations sometimes as in the case of the Spanish in central and south America defying all the odds. In order to answer this we have to look at the possibility that Eurasian peoples themselves are in some way superior to other `racial' denominations around the world. This argument would state that Eurasians are cleverer, more ingenious more inventive and have the potential to be better organised that other inferior `races' in the world. This is a very dangerous argument to accept, as it would justify racism, and persecution of less developed societies. In fact this is exactly what happened when European explorers and settlers came face to face with the native populations and the Americas and Africa, leading to violent subjugation and slavery.  <br /> <br />Diamond quickly and rightly dismisses this false premise and argues that in many cases once native populations have been introduced to new technologies they have been better at exploiting and developing these than the Eurasian originators. Once we have dismissed the idea that there is fundamental difference in the inherent abilities of different racial groups we are still left with the question why is that the Eurasian people developed in to the most advanced technological society in human history while some human populations were still living a stone age existence.  <br /> <br />Diamond begins to answer this question by taking us back 13,000 years, a point in human development were there were no clear cut differences in different peoples around the world. From this starting point he looks at the four main reasons why this subsequent uneven development took place.  <br /> <br />HUNTERS AGAINST FARMERS [Jameson Thottam] <br /> <br />It is evident from looking at history that there seems to have been a steady developmental progression from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities based on stable food production. Indeed it is safe to say that there as never been an advanced complex civilisation that has sustained itself by the hunter gathering lifestyle.  <br /> <br />It would seem to be a natural development for all ancient societies to have developed in this way and yet we find that early people in Mesopotamia developed farming thousands of years before peoples in the Americas and in some parts of the world hunter-gatherer groups still survive. Diamond goes on to make the point that in order for hunters to become farmers they need to be able to domesticate crops and animals for food production. Geographical difference climatic differences and the very orientation of the Eurasian continent on a east west axis as opposed to a north south axis of the Americas and Africa all conspire to make these development considerably easier in Eurasia. These factors coupled with a natural abundance of plant and animals species that easily lend themselves to domestication provide Eurasia witha massive advantage. By contrast Africa, America and Australasia have few if any suitable plant or animal candidates for domestication.  <br /> <br />BIGGER IS BETTER [James Thottam] <br /> <br />Diamond argues that as a consequence of stable food production primitive societies were able to increase their populations and settle in bigger permanent communities. These early settlements quickly developed into larges towns and cities. A further consequence of larger communities and stable food production was the greater possibility of certain individuals to concentrate on specialist tasks rather than simply on food production. This gave rise to technological advancement. As the lager population units expanded and came across others such as themselves trade became necessary.  <br /> <br />The increase in population also made society more potentially violent which then necessitated the imposition of rules or laws leading to a elite growing up to enforce those laws. This increase in complexity also made the societies better able to wage war and gather resources.  <br /> <br />GERMS [Jameson Thottam] <br /> <br />Despite Europe's early advantage over other peoples in other continents we should not imagine that the first European explorer to reach America post 1492 and sub-Saharan Africa a few hundred years later entered sparsely populated continents with only stone age hunter gatherer to oppose them. This is far from the truth; both in America and Western Africa powerful well organised civilisations had developed numbering in the tens of millions. Technologically they might not have been quite as advanced but technology itself cannot explain how for instance a handful of Conquistadors could within a matter of a few years subjugate a powerful warlike empire such as the Incas and Aztecs. An explanation as to how this could have happened can be gained by considering the role of germs and disease.  <br /> <br />The development of cities and the proximity with which people wereliving with each other and their farms animals proved to be the perfect breeding ground for new nasty diseases that could never have arisen while a hunter-gatherer lifestyle was followed. Gradually the Eurasian population developed limited resistance to various killers such as smallpox and influenza, unfortunately when contaminated explorers came across the pristine populations in the Americas the natives had no protection and one of the biggest tragedies in human history took place with millions dying from the effects of European diseases.  <br /> <br />TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES [Jameson Thottam] <br /> <br />One final aspect is to consider the circumstances in which technology developed at such pace in Europe. Diamond quite rightly points out that the early technological advancements did not actually take place in Europe but in Asia. These advances quickly spread again due to many optimal conditions both geographical and cultural that existed. Differences in cultures and their ability to accept change did also have a part to play but this was not an overwhelming factor. In many cases due to the landscape or climate technological advances were not needed or sought for and in many cases the raw materials were not there to begin with.  <br /> <br />OVERALL [Jameson Thottam] <br /> <br />I found this book compelling both in it's arguments, which are both authoritatively and eloquently made by Diamond but also by his writing style which is very easy to follow and at no time make this vast subject overbearing.  <br /> <br />Obviously generalisation have to be made, exceptions to the rules are mentioned and lack of reliable data especially when it comes to the dating of early discoveries and civilisation, are not forgotten but at no time while reading the book did I feel that the author was stretching the evidence merely to back his own theory.  <br /> <br />About the Author [James Thottam] <br />Diamond is an anthropologist who has worked for many years in the treacherous areas of New Guinea and he often uses his experiences there to justify or better explain a point. However in writing this book he show an incredible understanding of many other scientific discipline from geology to medicine and he backs this up with a insightful view of history.  <br /> <br />The Research [Jameson Thottam] <br />The research carried out for this book must have been extensive to say the least. He uses some incredible examples from the historical records to add weight to his central premise; his style is so persuasive that you find yourself wandering why you had never thought of it in these terms before. It is the sign of a very talented writer (often lacking in a scientist) that such complicated and disparate scientific disciplines can be made to seem easy to grasp and logical to understand. It doesn't surprise me in the least that this book won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction and the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc Science Book Prize.  <br /> <br />The Audience [Jameson Thottam] <br />Who should read this book? Anyone interested in history, biology, anthropology or almost any other `ology' you care to mention. It is a very readable book and provided you have any interest in any of the subject covered you will be fascinated by it.  <br /> <br />In the end I'm not sure if he has answered the original question completely to my satisfaction but that would be a lot to ask, but importantly he never claims that what he is saying is the only interpretation of the facts just a reasonably good theory. I would say that his arguments are compelling and that he as done as much as anyone in the field of science to produce a unified explanation as to why we are the way we are today.  <br /> <br />The overall message of the book is that the course of history is far more complex than the history books would lead us to believe. The activities of men and women play only a limited part in explaining why history has been shaped the way it has. Human history is justas much depended on chance events, evolutionary biology, and climactic change as it is on human action. In the long term this realisation might act to make us more humble and give more consideration to our own minor place in the larger scheme of things.  <br /> <br />This book is a brilliant piece of popular science and should be read by anyone who has ever considered his her place in the modern world. You will not be overawed and you might actually end up a little wiser.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam
B00005V4O5|5.0|With `Remedy Lane', Pain of Salvation discarded doubts and worries that they could not make another album as good as `The Perfect Element'. As with many others, I would have enjoyed a second part to `The Perfect Element', but in some ways a new direction keeps the music fresh and interesting. With such a unique sound in the first place it would be a shame for the band to simply re-create a winning formula.<br /><br />While the general sound to the album is undeniably PoS, with Gildenlow's vocals still as diverse and emotional as ever and the unique mix-matching of prog sub-genres, `Remedy Lane' is a different direction for the band, one focusing much more on the emotions created by music as opposed to a concept. This is not to say Gildenlow has deserted the concept, there is one dealing with human relationships and the feelings attached to it, but it is much looser when compared to the weighted concepts of `The Perfect Element' and especially the latest release `Be'. With less emphasis on concepts PoS come up with arguably their finest array of musicianship, matching the seemingly unmatchable exhibit of TPE.<br /><br />The album is split into three main chapters, with the moody `Of Two Beginnings' working as an introduction. Chapter one includes some of PoS finest work to date, and is possibly my favourite of the three chapters (although that does change all too often). `Ending Theme' is a typical tragic PoS song, Gildenlow's vocal delivery is superb here, with a real sense of frustration and anguish as he bursts out the chorus lines. `Fandango' is a great example of what makes PoS so unique and compelling, for anyone new to the band, I'd check this out, after a few listens the odd melody and time changes really work, one of the `quirkier' songs of the album. `A Trace of Blood' is simply stunning, at just over 8 minutes it's very progressive in style and structure, recalling the kind of writing of the old prog gods such as Rush and Yes. Despite sounding relatively `upbeat', the lyrics deal with a stillborn child, adding yet another emotional dimension.<br /><br />Chapter two contains one of my favourite PoS ballads, `Undertow' is a melancholic piece full of emotional guitar playing and of course a huge vocal delivery by Gildenlow to cap it off. `Rope Ends', like `A Trace of Blood' is hard hitting in the lyric and music department and is the heaviest song on the album, full of disorientating guitar and drum arrangements, a fine jazz middle section and some poignant lyrics on considering suicide.<br /><br />Chapter three for me has two extremely fine moments, the first coming in the infectious `Waking Every God' which has a superb chorus with great vocal harmonising. The closing track is at times my favourite, twisting and turning through its 10 minute duration, showcasing some fine melancholic passages and great hard/soft contrasts.<br /><br />For anyone looking for something new and fresh in their progressive collection, this is certainly worth a try. For those already familiar with PoS, just not this album, what are you waiting for honey?vely `upbeat', the lyrics deal with a stillborn child, adding yet another emotional dimension.  <br /> <br />Chapter two contains one of my favourite PoS ballads, `Undertow' is a melancholic piece full of emotional guitar playing and of course a huge vocal delivery by Gildenlow to cap it off. `Rope Ends', like `A Trace of Blood' is hard hitting in the lyric and music department and is the heaviest song on the album, full of disorientating guitar and drum arrangements, a fine jazz middle section and some poignant lyrics on considering suicide.  <br /> <br />Chapter three for me has two extremely fine moments, the first coming in the infectious `Waking Every God' which has a superb chorus with great vocal harmonising.

B000005RFL|5.0|If one were to ask what Black Sabbath's golden era was, most ivory-tower music historians and co-called \\"experts\\" would probably say it was the band's first four albums. If you were to ask anyone (critic, or fan) what was Sabbath's best offering, \\"Paranoid,\\" (1970) or perhaps the self-titled debut, (1970) or even \\"Master of Reality\\" (1971) would be your answer. For this fan, however, I'm going to have to go with the band's fifth album \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" (1974) as being my personal favorite album by the legendary British metal band.<br /><br />In terms of creativity, musicianship, and songwriting, the iron was still hot by the time Sabbath recorded \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\\" Key elements that so defined the band's first four albums are still in place; blues-based, sluggish riffs, a gloomy outlook, and gothic trappings abound, but this time the band try to expand their sound by introducing synthesizers and orchestration into their formula (courtesy of Rick Wakeman of YES). Like any of the band's first six albums, Sabbath is as focused and tight as ever.<br /><br />In all honesty, the first six albums are all classics, all flawless; you could really argue any of the first six releases as being the band's best album. I tend to give the nod to \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" because I think it showcases Iommi's best riffs and the added synths work really well encompassed into the band's bluesy/sluggish signature sound.<br /><br />On \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" like any classic Sabbath or early Ozzy solo work, we see Ozzy in his prime. Long before Ozzy Osbourne became a parody of himself, being known to most as an oafish buffoon on a reality show as opposed to an icon, he really was genuinely chilling. Geezer Butler (bass) and Bill Ward's (drums) bone-crunching rhythm section are as intimidating and intense as ever.<br /><br />The opening title track \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" stands as one of the band's greatest songs. From the second the needle hits the groove of the record, or you press play on your CD player, your senses are almost overwhelmed by a riff that is simultaneously intense, gripping and infectious. As the song grinds along, it goes from angry, lean and mean, to a melodic, almost bittersweet, to a full-throttle attack. After the overwhelming \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" the listener is offered a reprieve with the laid-back yet fully captivating \\"A National Acrobat.\\" The beautiful melancholy acoustic \\"Fluff\\" is perhaps Iommi's all-time greatest instrumental and serves as a sharp contrast to the rest of the album. The band's experimentation makes itself known with the hard-hitting \\"Sabbra Cadabra,\\" as synthesizers and piano come out of left-field, throwing the listener a welcome curveball. One of the band's bleakest songs, \\"Killing Yourself\\" is kind of like a heavy-metal version of John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero.\\" The gloomy-as-could-be synth-heavy \\"Who are you\\" enters prog-rock country.

074322454X|4.0|This is a truly fine chronicle of one rifle company of the renowned and celebrated 101st Airborne Division during the second world war.  It traces E Company from basic training to the German surrender, and even includes an Afterword that traces the postwar careers of some of the Company's notable personages.<br /><br />This is a very insightful story.  The one thing I took away from the book is that the 101st really was an elite unit the fighting qualities of which have not been exaggerated with time.  The 101st routinely outfought more powerfully-armed German units through teamwork, leadership, and elan.  Remember that airborne units were light infantry, without much armor or artillery support.  The Germans, by contrast, had been digging in to prepare for the Allied invasion for years, and had the benefit of all of these things.  Nonetheless, the 101st, and other fine Allied units like it, roundly trounced the Germans all the way to the Rhine and beyond.  Author Ambrose's thesis is that despite the fact that the Wehrmacht was a fine army with crack soldiers, in the final analysis free men make better soldiers than do the products of totalitarian states like Nazi Germany.  In \\"Band of Brothers\\" he makes a pretty good case that this is so.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" has some fascinating anecdotes of war.  My favorite is the discussion of the 101st capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest, and of Hermann Goering's palatial estate in Southern Germany.  Our troops helped themselves to the best cognac and champaigne that Goering had been able to steal and stockpile.  Well, good for them!  The discussion of Lt. Sobel (later Captain), the first Commanding Officer of Easy Co., was also fascinating.  The reader comes away conflicted about Sobel, who remains an enigmatic figure; a strange combination of poor leadership and effective training skills.<br /><br />This is a very insightful story, and even allowing for a touch of understandable enthusiasm by the author for Easy Co., the reader comes away with tremendous respect for the fighting capabilities of, and the personal sacrifices made by, the soldiers of the 101st Airborne and other Allied units in that terrible conflict.Co., the reader comes away with tremendous respect for the fighting capabilities of, and the personal sacrifices made by, the soldiers of the 101st Airborne and other Allied units in that terrible conflict.
0553801503|5.0|In order to fully appreciate the 4th book of George R. R. Martin's fantasy saga, one must look back to the previous installments and observe the multi-faceted growth of the characters and the masterful twisting of the plot that the author has unbelievably thickened and enriched so much so that its metaphors come alive in our eyes, jump out of the page as dire omens and portents that we believe, not only through our \\"fantasy reader senses\\" (which to a certain extent we fortify with a cache of 'suspended disbelief from the real world'), but also through to our instinctual fears and superstitions, passed down from generations through blood, stories and other traditions.  <br /> <br />It is frighteningly easy to drown oneself in G. R. R. Martin's terrible world. We are drawn to its suffering like flies to honey, as it tickles in us a morbid fascination for the macabre. There are no stark black nor white characters in his saga. Often everyone's mettle is tested, and from the fires of battle (whether in field or in court), all characters that Martin has turned his delicate mind on would unfailingly emerge as glittering gems--brighter, darker, multi-faceted--but all would stand to attract attention in their own way.

The character development, the acting and the writing were all impeccable<br /><br />I cannot recommend this DVD set enough.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|Let me just say that Eli Roth is really becoming a great horror movie writer and director right before are eyes. He just keeps improving. This is based on some college guys back packing there way through Europe. There looking to have great fun with Drugs and a lot of sex. Well that leads them to Slovokia where they are dazeled by the local women who then gain there trust to only drug them later. They find them selves in some abonded factory only to live out there worst nightmare. There a lot of T&A in the begining I feel so that when all the torture and gore hit you have a happy place to go to. It has a pretty simple story line but it works for this film. It also leaves you with that horrible feeling that a good horror film should do. Even though this was a R film it's a strong one. To wrap it up lots of T&A and Some real heart pounding Gore. Check this one out!

I read the Foundation series years ago and never read the prelude.  Since reading this I am reading the series again.  It is fascinating and as always Asminov touches on truths.  Anyone interested in Astronomy or any type of science for that matter must read this book and of course the whole series.  <br />Amazon delivered the item as scheduled and it was in excellent condition.
0060989157|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.   <br /> <br />From the very start, all four members of Motley Cre tell their own story of their lives and the life of the band.  This book is filled with tons and tons of awesome storys from the road and everyone is either funny as hell, cool, or personal which makes this book so good.  I read this book three times because there is so much in it and for everyone who likes hard rock or heavy metal, it is required reading, hands down.  <br /> <br />This book is easily the best rock and roll book ever written and should be on everyones list.  There is nothing to complain about either.  You do not have to like the band or the music to love it and that may be why its so good.  Read it and you will thank me.

B000003TA4|5.0|Having just read the journals of Kurt Cobain, I feel I have a new perspective on this phenomenal album, Kurt, and the group as a whole.  Kurt was extremely intelligent, caring, sensitive, a hard worker, and determined to secure his place in punk rock history.  And he did just that with his albums, Nevermind and In Utero.  <br /> <br />If you are a Nirvana fan but haven't bought the book, I would STRONGLY encourage you to!!  It is mesmerizing to see the actual hand-written pages photocopied from Kurt's Mead notebooks.  Many of the songs from Nevermind are scratched out in the notebook as he penned the lyrics.  Words are scribbled out and re-written.  Notes about what should be happening on the drums or guitar are jotted in the margins.  And even songs that never made it onto an album are handwritten on notebook paper. <br /> <br />On one sheet of notebook paper, you can see where Kurt scribbled out the song layout for the album, Nevermind.  Beside each song, he wrote what mood the song portrayed.  It is obvious that he tried to balance the album with happy, sad, and mad.  And to the right of this list is a messy hand drawing of the album cover, dollar bill on a hook, baby swimming, etc.  According to his hand drawing, he initially wanted the words Verse Chrous Verse to appear on the album cover, but scratched it out and wrote Nevermind in it's place. <br /> <br />So with that being said, I will further say that Nevermind is one of the two best (In Utero being the other) albums to be produced in rock history.  Kurt Cobain was a musical genius.  What this group did with the barest essentials of musical equipment is nothing short of amazing.  The words of each song scream out of the speakers with force and adrenaline and you can feel the mood through every guitar run.    <br /> <br />It is safe to say that no REAL rock fan's album collection is complete without at least a few Nirvana selections.  Nevermind would be a fabulous start if you haven't yet added their music to your collection!
B000AARKOO|2.0|KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an impossible story with a confusing time-line. Balian (Orlando Bloom, PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN) is the unlikely hero of Jerusalem during the dark days of the early Christian crusades. Visited by his (up to that point) unknown father (Liam Neeson, KINSEY) shortly after the death of his wife and child, Balian learns that he is the son of a noble Templar Knight.<br /><br />Immediately thrown into their midsts, he learns swordplay \\"in the name of God.\\" His quest, he soon learns, is to protect those within the walls of Jerusalem, even from themselves. When war breaks out amongst a group of Muslim warriors (something that's set up rather slip-shoddily by Brendan Gleeson, COLD MOUNTAIN) and the Christian army gets slaughtered out on the nearby plains, Balian becomes the protector of the city, knighting every able-bodied man willing and able to carry a sword or shoot a bow.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, 1982) gives us an overly-righteous Gladiator flick that has plenty of action but very little substance.<br /><br />The main issues are with historical accuracies (which were apparently thrown to the wind!), character development (shallow!), and a time-line that was impossible to follow.<br /><br />So many things were inaccurate that it's difficult to know where to start. Costumes, the activities of women of the times, the non-punished actions of those who cast-out blasphemy, etc., all made this film completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The characters, many of whom come and go in quick succession, are so underdeveloped that most viewers (at least I didn't) might not give a rat's a$$ what happens to them.<br /><br />And the time-line. There are no text notifications on the screen to let us know how much time has passed. Balian digs wells with friends and fellow citizens, travels far and wide, sails around the hub of the world, returns to his blacksmith shop, and we have no idea-NO IDEA!-how much time has passed.<br /><br />I will say that the action/battle scenes were fairly impressive, but many of these types of combat sequences are becoming passe and even cliche-ish. So nothing new can be credited in this department either.<br /><br />I'm a pretty big fan of Ridley Scott's work, too (I all but gushed over the aforementioned GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER, as well as ALIEN, MATCHSTICK MEN, and BLACK HAWK DOWN), but this most certainly isn't up to his normally high standards in my humble opinion./>I will say that the action/battle scenes were fairly impressive, but many of these types of combat sequences are becoming passe and even cliche-ish.

B000059H99|5.0|It finally happened--my fiancee consented and agreed to watch Rocky with me. <br /> <br />Being female, she was quite hesitant to watch it. After all, Rocky is Sylvester Stallone in one of his most famous \\"macho\\" roles. It is a movie about boxing. A guy movie for sure, right? She thought she was in for two hours of torture. <br /> <br />But it was not to be so: just like I said she would, she actually liked Rocky. She liked it alot. <br /> <br />That's because (as she pointed out after the movie) Rocky isn't a movie about boxing. Not really. It is about a man who has been a disappointment to himself in life, who gets a second chance--the chance of a lifetime--and makes good. It is a movie about redemption. It is a movie about the American Dream. <br /> <br />It is a classic film (Best Picture winner, in fact), and is compelling to human beings of either gender. So, ladies, be not afraid to see this film. Gentlemen, be not afraid to show it to your girlfriends/fiancees/wives. Quite likely they will be surprised by how much they'll enjoy it.

Don't tell me you don't even find this a little laughable.  Hell, maybe it's the dry humour that we English all supposedly have.    Don't get me wrong, I think America is great.  Long live our alliance!  Long live the superpowers!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I don't know why people are putting this DVD down.Ok I know metallica has a therapist but man it takes alot to do what they do. One of the best scenes is when Lars meets Dave Mustaine. It's pretty deep and it's something that they both had to get off their sholders. Being a fan of Megadeth and Metallica man it was something I and all metal fans were probably waiting for.This documentry gets pretty deep. From James going to rehab, to Jason playing with a diffrent band, to Metallica on the verge of breaking up, to metallica findig a new bassit to tour and the release of St. Anger. But that album was their worst. But after watching this, it looks like they rushed that album to come out. Some other interesting stuff on here is Jason and Metallica telling their side of why they decided to go their own ways. And James and Lars are also going at it alot. I almost feel bad for Kirk because he's stuck in the middle. It might make you look at metallica diffent. You might hate them, you might like them more, you might even respect them, but one thing is for sure is that you have to give them credit for opening up and releasing this.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|The film itself is very well made and pleasing to watch.  Buy it today, by all means.   <br /> <br />My extreme distaste is to the fact that in the book this is based on, the British actually fight (and beat) an American ship in the war of 1812 (which the poor Brits had to fight at the same time as the Napoleonic war).  What's the matter with you Americans?  Can't you stand to see a little defeat on the big screen with some great historics to go with it?  You won the damn war in the end, anyway!  In most historical films the British are portrayed as evil and tyrannical (Braveheart, The Patriot), or else just bumbling, and ultra-posh.  What a load of Hollywood Hogwash!  It's like in \\"The Last Samurai\\", where you just have to have some American heroe gloating over victory. <br /> <br />Free your minds people!  (Take no offence, please.  I think Americans are great!)
0380002930|5.0|Not to be overly ga-ga about this book, but it is very well done.  I read it aloud to my kids (over several weeks), but it is certainly appropriate and rewarding for adults.  I was never \\"assigned\\" this book in school and would have missed it entirely but for an Amazon.com recommendation.  I'm glad I found it.  Adams accomplished something here, building a heroic and sometime pulse-pounding tale upon the short and otherwise timid lives of rabbits.  The plot twists and turns are excellent, and ending the book required us (my kids and me) to say goodbye to some great characters. There are plenty of summaries of this book on this page and elsewhere, so I'll skip that - but trust me on this one.  It's good.
B000AARKOO|1.0|Everything has to be so politically correct these days, it makes me sick.  This film over-emphasises the atrocites commited by the christians, and doesn't even touch on the Muslim crimes.  Oh, the things they did!  History is history.  There's no changing it, and it's absolutely fascinating, so they might as well give the truth. <br /> <br />The film itself is not bad at all; good acting, thrilling battle sequences etc. <br /> <br />The battle in which Raynald and his army perish, (I forget the name, where's my book on it!) is completely cut out, and it is suggested that the Christians were weak from heat and mal-nutrition.  The battle itself would have mad a breathtaking movie sequence; with the christians sallying around what the believed was the \\"true cross\\" for a last stand.  And the mass beheading of surviving christians (not by soldiers but by willing Muslim fanatics; not expertised swordsmen, so the grisly process took hours) was also cut, strangely enough... <br /> <br />Considering that Muslim fundamentalists still declare \\"Jihad\\" freely today anyway, we might as well learn about it's origins!
B0000TB050|4.0|Great concert, but I preferred the Chicago Vertigo tour video. However, you can't go wrong with U2.
B000BMSU68|3.0|I first saw \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" in 1991, and I've LOVED it ever since.  I was so thrilled to see that Paramount was giving this classic film an upgraded DVD Special Edition.  Upon seeing it however, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed.  The extras, although enjoyable, are sorely lacking what they could and SHOULD be.  Most of the film's major stars (and sometimes even minor ones like Kristy Swanson and Richard Edson) provide some updated interviews that are fun to watch.  But, the bonus material and interviews featuring Mia Sara are all from 1986!  She obviously CAN'T be that busy these days, so doesn't it make sense that an updated interview with her could have been included? <br /> <br />Also, the shooting script for this movie contains MANY deleted scenes and dialogue, some of which were a GREAT read and are bound to have been filmed.  Ferris going through the house looking for money in some STRANGE places (all while the Pink Floyd tune \\"Money\\" was playing), as well as Cameron's dad seeing his 1961 Ferarri being driven through Chicago's streets by the two parking garage employees would have been GREAT to see.  However, the ONLY deleted scene we get here is a behind-the-scenes version of the waiter at Chez Qui telling the trio that the food they were eating was pancreas (which of course was referred to later by Ferris in the taxi).  No true special edition DVD should be without a deleted scenes section.  VERY disappointing. <br /> <br />Next, this edition (like the original) does NOT include a theatrical trailer.  It's rare for even a bare bones DVD not to include at least one trailer, but nearly UNHEARD of for a special edition!  It's bound to still exist, and I can't beleive that it's THAT hard to find that they could not have dug it up for this \\"special\\" edition. <br /> <br />Finally, the original DVD, while lacking a trailer, DID include a GREAT feature-length commentary track by writer/director John Hughes.  However, that commentary track is NOT included here!  That was either a severe oversight or a downright mean move by Paramount.  How hard would it have been to reproduce it here?  In effect, its omission forces anyone who bought the original DVD and wants to upgrade to the special edition to keep the original instead of selling or trading it, all because they want to retain the commentary.  Paramount should have at least made it possible that owning this new DVD would provide the most complete \\"Ferris\\" experience presently possible by itself, but without the original's commentary it doesn't. <br /> <br />In summary, if you bought the original DVD, then I advise you to keep it and just rent this new version to give the special features a look.  Save the rest of what you would otherwise spend on this to put towards something more worthwhile.  If you have NOT bought the original DVD however, then this would be a worthwhile purchase to own the extras that were not present on the original.  But, do rent the original to give a listen to that AWESOME commentary track by John Hughes. <br /> <br />
055357342X|5.0|I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  The twists and turns in this book made for some heavy duty thinking to keep up with everything that is going on in the world of Westeroes.  I absolutely love fiesty Arya!  She has grit and fire and passion.  I can't wait to see where her story goes.  Jon Snow is da man!  As Lord Commander I hope he lives longer than the rest of his brothers.  <br /> <br />I want to know more about Rickon - what happened to him?  What is Bran going to learn to help him \\"fly\\"?  I hope the author answers these questions soon!  I think Sansa and Catelyn were a little too whiney for me in this book. <br /> <br />I am beginning to really like Jaime - he is the anti-hero hero of this book as is Tyrion.  I love Tyrion's humor and brains.  If only, if only, he was not born a dwarf he would have been a King! The cliff hanger ending is superb.
B00006CXSS|1.0|Only one star for quite nice special effects. Spielberg and Hanks have done some patriotic, most unrealistic and pathetic \\"thing\\", far more pathetic than Saving Private Ryan. I hope you know that neither the US- nor the german soldiers were like shown in this sorry effort. Save your money, go buy some books about the topic instead. That way you can learn better about the liberation of old-europe and Germany at the end of WWII.
0553579908|5.0|This book built upon A Game of Thrones, for a wonderful second helping.  There was more of everything that made the first book so great:  intrigue, humor, sacrifice, honor, duty and more dashes of magic and dragons thrown in. I didn't think it was possible to have a second book live up to the first, but I was wrong!  Definitely a must read.
B000007VCO|5.0|It's really the best of show.  I prefer it over the other 2 SANTANA albums somewhat similar to this, Love Devotion Surrender and Illuminations.  There's a purity and calm in this one that's difficult to find on any other album, even a SANTANA one.  Somehow this album captures something that is beyond the usual Mexican/San Francisco/rock/Mexican music flavored music that SANTANA is famous for.  Instead it is more a musical spiritual journey yet completely on the money, not, as I mentioned, sorta odd like the other two somewhat similar SANTANA albums.<br /><br />This is more of a jazz/spiritual music/easy on the Eastern music/gentle SANTANA thing that totally works.  chrisbct@hotmail.com
0553573403|5.0|After reading several rave reviews I didn't know what I would find between the covers of George RR Martin's book.  This book is more like a fictional world that has dashes of fantasy thrown in.  It is fast paced, well writtn, full of well-fleshed out characters and a gripping story.  This book was definitely worth the read.  Between the covers you will find intrigue, politics, humor, heart break, love, sacrifice, honor, magic and dragons.

0743457900|5.0|I've read all of John Le Carre's novels with mostly enjoyment. His understanding of how his country's intelligence worked-or didn't is profound. Some of this may derive from his own stint in the service himself. David Cornwell, writing as Le Carre, served 3 years in Her Majesty's Secret Services. Much of his writing, particularly these early novels, concern the struggle between the West and Communism as it relates to spycraft.<br /><br />Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, a continuance of the Smiley's People trilogy, gives the reader an unsparing glimpse as to what damage a traitor amongst ones own ranks can do.<br /><br />The Setting: Great Britain. George Smiley is in retirement, after the death of Control, and the swift changes that took place immediately after. Smiley, along with others is fired. His marriage to the Lady Ann is on the rocks.<br /><br />Peter Guillam arrives unexepectedly and appears highly upset. His request: That Smiley come with him to meet with Oliver Lacon, the Minister and listen to a few things concerning a former \\"student\\" of Smiley's Ricky Tarr.<br /><br />The interview with Tarr proves instructive to Smiley, who immediately recognizes what the others are after-a mole within the ranks. Le Carre is at his best here as he leads the readers through the eyes of George Smiley, down the trail of footprints left by the traitor. And through the echoes of his wife, Smiley begins to sense the magnitude of what he is after.<br /><br />What results is a nightmarish excursion in discovering that someone deep inside the Circus' hallowed precincts, is in fact, a double agent.<br /><br />Le Carre is adept at plumbing the petty jealousy, territorial fights, and other darker parts of the human experience. His writing is crisp, eloquent in a subtle and highly readable manner. He rarely ever lets himself off the hook by painting his heroes and villains in less than unsparing color.<br /><br />This is one of John Le Carre's best in many ways. The rich and evocative plot line never flags, the characters are completely human, and his deft unfolding of the investigation are both absorbing and thought provoking.<br /><br />The ending is both sad, and though in one sense, justice is served in an unexpected way, it's as with most things in life.. bittersweet and any true closure will never be realized.<br /><br />Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, published in 1974 is still as relevant today as it was then. Though the Cold War may be officially over, the same mechanisms that drove the antagonists in this book, are present today.The rich and evocative plot line never flags, the characters are completely human, and his deft unfolding of the investigation are both absorbing and thought provoking.  <br /> <br />The ending is both sad, and though in one sense, justice is served in an unexpected way, it's as with most things in life.. bittersweet and any true closure will never be realized.  <br /> <br />Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, published in 1974 is still as relevant today as it was then.

B000000P17|4.0|It's just a cover album of punk songs. When it was released it wasnt supposed to sell millions it was just to tied the fans over for a while(I.E. LIES).  You  Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory is a great song to begin with and duff does a great job with it. attitude is awesome. I dont like I don't care about you very much but the only song on this album that i really hate is Look at Your Game Girl written by charles manson. cough cough publicity stunt. overall for what it is , this cd is really good.
0307276902|4.0|As a physician and recovering drug addict, maybe I can add something to this overall discussion.  [Previous discussion up till now (1-16-06)].   <br /> <br />One, once a drug and alcohol addict (a redundancy, since alcohol is a drug), always an addict.  You can say you're recovering, but never recovered. <br /> <br />Two, no dentist worth his salt would ever perform the kind of procedure Mr. Frey describes without anaesthesia.  It would be malpractice to do so. Local anaesthesia is not contraindicated in drug addiction;  there is no reason not to give it, as it doesn't make you high, and therefore is of no danger.  <br /> <br />Three, the rehab center discussed in the book is not named specifically, but those of us in the know recognize it as Hazelden. <br /> <br />Four, lying is part and parcel of addiction; we become so used to lying that it becomes second nature.  That is part of the benefit of 12-step programs; they teach us to be honest, something we have not done since we crossed that invisible line between \\"normal\\" drinking and alcoholic drinking.  <br /> <br />Five, the religious part of the programs discussed can be ignored, or not mentioned.  There are other programs (SOS, SMART recovery, etc.) which do not use the concept of God in them. (Why Hazelden does not at least mention them is beyond me, though the 12-step programs have the best success rate.)(If you can call 1-20% best). Although the majority of AA's believe in God, or at least some Diety, there are those of us who are athiests who are in AA; we just use some concept of a Higher Power (e.g., the organization of AA itself) to refer to.   <br /> <br />Six, are rich people immune to addiction?  Should they be denied recover just because of their money?   <br /> <br />Seven, the people commenting above (in the other discussions) are for the most part (90% statistically) all \\"normals\\", they have no concept of what it means to be an alcoholic/addict.  (Deep down, whether they admit it or not, they really think that the alcoholic/addict suffers from a weakness of will, not a real disease).  As people who can \\"take it or leave it\\", they have no concept of the craving, the sell-your-mother-to get-a-fix (or a drink) mind set of the person in the throes of addiction.  Therefore, they can no more understand the underlying truth behind the lies than they can conceive how they can crave a drug, just as we cannot conceive of how they can just put a drink down and walk away.   <br /> <br />Or how we will lie, and think it's the truth, if we aren't properly treated.
1932100385|4.0|I grew up in a small Chinese village, and vividly remember the faces of all the old-age people when I was a child. I have been back to the same village a few times in the last few years, have seen the difference between now and the time before the economic boom. Now people have much better life, and they are eating much \\"better\\", yet the villagers are dying much younger, with all kind of modern health problems: heart problems, all kind of cancers, etc. What I am saying is not scientifically based, yet I want to say it: I think the life span of Chinese villagers is shorter now than 20 years ago, when they were much poorer, consuming mostly \\"raw\\" stuff. This early deaths of the people in my home town puzzled me and my wife a great deal, and we have been wondering: why? why they are all dying so young when they are all enjoying a much \\"better\\" life? <br /> <br />I bought the book, and will read it with great interest. I am working in the field of medicine that treats cancer patients, and I always wonder why there are so many cancer patients in the States?, and I was surprised that the Chinese villagers are now having all kinds of cancers, and having the diseases unheard of during my child years. <br /> <br />I will try to share with you my persepctive after I read the book. <br /> <br />Kevin in California
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Alright, I'll be the first to admit that Enya isn't breaking any new ground with this CD.<br /><br />You know what I say to that?  Good!<br /><br />Sometimes you don't want someone to \\"break new ground.\\"  In fact, I'm getting to hate that phrase.  When I bought Amarantine, I thought to myself, \\"I hope this is filled with the same magic as A Day Without Rain, or Watermark, or any of them.\\"  I didn't want to pop it into the deck and hear some big change of style, that's for sure.<br /><br />So when the CD began playing, and those beautiful, lush, choral chords washed in, I was thrilled.  This CD is Enya through and through, unmistakable and unduplicated.  The songs are all new, yet they are at once as familiar as being home with your loved ones.<br /><br />I don't know, nor do I care, how she and her producer manage to get it right every time.  I'm just glad they do.<br /><br />If you're an Enya lover, or at least have an appreciation for her soothing, otherworldly music, then you will not be at all disappointed by this offering.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a very funny and very well made movie. In fact, it is my # 3 favorite computer animated movie of all time topped only by Shrek  and Ice Age. It is all about a clownfish named Marlin who has lost his son, Nemo, the second protagonist next to him, and is looking all over the ocean to find him, facing lots of danger and lots of different sea animals, including three sharks(who are definitely the coolest with one exception)and some sea turtles and most importantly, a reef fish named Dory who has short term memory loss (POOR GIRL! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!)Anyway, there are lots of funny lines and/or scenes, as well as a really cool white and black-striped fish named Gill(Nemo was cute, but Gill is my # 1 favorite in this movie and is the only one who tops the sharks. In fact, Gill has been my favorite since the start in this movie in the same way Dragon has when it comes to Shrek and Diego the Saber-Tooth has when it comes to Ice Age)Anyway, this is a very funny and very touching movie and if you like computer animation or nature, this is for you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This WWII miniseries follows the 101st airborne from training through the war's end. It has some of the greatest scenes of battle ever filmed, along with a feel for the bonding that a group of soldier's develop over time. Gritty and unsanitized it shows why these men made up what is known as America's Greatest Generation, and reminds you of their sacrifice. Thank You veteran's from a proud nation.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is the only album that has ever made me go \\"Wow!\\".  The first real album that I bought (I already had The Essential Bob Dylan, which is a great starting point for would be fans).  So of course, I had heard \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" before.  I already knew what to expect.  After that, I was taken in so many directions that today's rather mediocre junk never even attempts to.  Highway 61 Revisited never takes the foot off of the pedal, and that's what makes it so great.

B000002UA9|4.0|The covers are average to above average(except for \\"Twist and Shout\\", which is a great Lennon vocal).  What makes Please Please Me work is the early Beatles classics that are on display.  \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" is one of the best album openers out there.  It works extremely well.  Even though Lennon/McCartney had yet to really show their songwriting chaps, they penned some fun, energetic songs.  \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" really stand out on the album.  Just a sample of what was to come on later albums.

B0000C8AVE|5.0|Freewheelin' was VERY hard to get into at first.  I had already bought everything from Dylan's electric period, and had only heard songs here and there from the folk period.  Two things struck me immediately:  Masters of War was by far one of Dylan's most venomous song.  I winced at some of the lines on it (\\"Even Jesus could never forgive what you do\\" comes to mind).  The second was upon listening to A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.  It was incredibly moving, for some reason that I still can't put my finger on.  Dylan's poetry at it's best.  The album also has some funnier songs, and despite \\"Masters\\", \\"Blowing in the Wind\\", and \\"Hard Rain\\", it's actually pretty upbeat.  If you don't like it at first (I'm a huge Dylan fan and I couldn't get into it until three listens), try it a few more times.  Odds are it'll grow on you more and more each time.
1573225517|5.0|My wife convinced me to read High Fidelity.  I'm glad she did.<br /><br />Nick Hornby poses the question (I'm paraphrasing here folks): \\"Does one listen to depressing music because one is depressed or is one depressed because one keeps listening to depressing music?\\" I found this question (and my subsequent answer) life changing.<br /><br />I recommend anyone infatuated with artists such as Elliott Smith, The Cure, Morrissy, Nick Drake, Sandy Denny, and so on and so forth, read Hornby's book, and then take stock of your life. I still listen to some of that stuff but not the way I used to.  I even went out and bought a bunch of old Rolling Stones, Humble Pie, and other assorted \\"fun\\" records.  I stopped taking what I was listening to so darn seriously - it just ISN'T that important folks!  I'm much happier, I get along better with others and I'm a better communicator.  I believe I owe some of these positive changes to the recognition of myself in Rob's character.  One of two novels (To Kill A Mockingbird being the other) that has actually influenced my life.  Thanks Nick!
B000002UAC|5.0|Of the first half of the Beatles' albums (pre-Rubber Soul era), I think this album is the fastest and funnest (that's not a word) of them.  It's incredibly short (though no Beatles album, except for the White Album or Abbey Road qualifies as long), but this tightness is what makes it work.

That is because it is clear from the start of this 2005 bio-pic that this is the love story of Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) and June (Reese Witherspoon).  In the last act of the film my wife expressed surprise that the couple were not married yet and I told her that this film was going to be over as soon as she finally said \\"yes.\\"  I was close on that score, because the film includes an important grace note and fade out that says it all.  But even if you knew nothing about their legendary love it would be clear from the opening scenes of this movie when a young J.R. Cash and his brother Jack are listening to young June Carter singing on the radio.<br /><br />What I liked about \\"Walk the Line\\" was that even knowing the key threads of the story, all of which are cinematic commonplaces, the screenplay by writer Gill Dennis and director James Mangold delivers memorable scenes.  One thread is how Cash became the Man in Black, and when he blows his audition in front of Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the legendary head of Sun Records in Memphis gives him a slim second chance with a dead on speech as to how Cash needs to be singing songs.  Cash happens to have been inspired by a film about a prison in California to write a song, and he starts to sing it and changes before our eyes and ears.  Cash and his father, Ray (Robert Patrick), have been at odds since a childhood tragedy and we wait for the moment when the son will finally tell the father off.  But when it comes Cash is still living in a glass house and the tables do not get turned.<br /><br />\\"Walk the Line\\" saves the best for last.  The famous concert at Folsom Prison is the first of two significant payoffs, as it represents Cash finally embodying his songs and not simply singing them.  The connection between Cash and his audience changed then and he finally became a man.  But that was not enough for June who has been refusing all of his proposals.  When his family could do nothing to save Cash from his drug addiction, it is June and her family who step in, however she makes it clear that she will sing with him but she will not marry him.  Now, most of us remember the lady as June Carter Cash, so we know that she is going to say yes.  What is important is that it clearly will take something special for her to consent, and this film comes up with a moment worthy of their relationship and out anticipation.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing and what is key is not that they imitate Johnny and June but that they capture their hearts, which is a good thing in a romance, even when it also happens to be a bio-pic.  During the final credits we finally hear the real Johnny and June singing as they take their curtain call.  But when their voices fade away and we return to the plaintive guitar pickin' of T-Bone Burnett our thoughts return to Lynne's lovely elegy:<br /><br />\\"Now were starting over it's the place that we are<br /><br />You look more than pretty underneath all the stars<br /><br />Love, love is a burning thing<br /><br />Oh how I still love to hear you sing<br /><br />And everything we ever heard about heaven is true<br /><br />Today's the day that Johnny met June<br /><br />Today's the day that Johnny met June.\\"bles do not get turned. <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" saves the best for last.

Told from several character's points of view, this story keeps you turning the pages.  The topic is very interesting and the writing is great.  I was shellshocked at the end-I cried and I never do that when reading a book!!!!!
0767817664|5.0|This is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s.  It's an updated version on an old theme:  Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire.<br /><br />Chris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge.  Amanda Bearse (\\"Married with Children\\") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge's desires.  And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy.<br /><br />No one really believes Charley's rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire.  Charley's geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn't believe him; nor does Amy.<br /><br />Desperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host \\"Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer.\\"  Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley's \\"savior\\" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money.<br /><br />Roddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) \\"convince\\" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley's suspicions are true.<br /><br />Dandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved.  He is immediately infatuated with the young girl.<br /><br />But first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends.<br /><br />The special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative.  The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland's direction makes it work.  (Holland's other works include \\"Child's Play,\\" \\"The Temp,\\" and \\"Thinner\\").<br /><br />The DVD transfer is sharp and clean.  The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1).  Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround.<br /><br />The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  Sub-titles are available in several languages:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  The disc is also close-captioned for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />Specs:  Running time:  116 mins.<br />Copyright 1985 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.<br />Copyright 1998 Layout and Design Columbia TriStar Home Video
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book.  Even if the facts aren't all 100% accurate it opens the mind of the reader into what it may be like to be heavily chemically dependent.  I would still recommend this book to anyone.  I am going to read My Friend Leonard next without hesitation.
0375703861|4.0|Written with verve and permeated with a subtle irony always catching its target, \\"White teeth\\" is maybe the best debut work I've ever read. Zadie Smith is wonderful in drawing her characters, in painting their peculiarities in a sarcastic way, but never passing the line of the caricature. In few words she's able to stay suspended on the verge of a precipice, never loosing her perfect balance.<br /><br />[...]
0618526412|5.0|This book BEATIFULL, FUNNY and DRAMATIC all at the same time. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AY74OG|5.0|This is a good movie - my kids really enjoy it and I think it's pretty funny, too!
0300108834|4.0|An excellent, sweeping, review of world history written in a fashion that young people can understand and appreciate. <br /> <br />Most, if not all, kids will learn about world history in school piece by piece and when they do they will probably get bogged down in details like \\"How much corn did the Incas grow?\\", \\"What is the average rainfall in Egypt?\\" type \\"testable\\" minutiae that turns people off from history because they think that to know history they have to know which country grew the most apples in the 18th century. <br /> <br />But this book presents history in an interesting manner that shows the impact of individual people, and sweeps you from one time and place to the next one while referring back to what you already read so you can fit it all together in your mind. <br /> <br />I bought my copy so my three kids can \\"find\\" it on my bookshelf sometime down the road and think they've discovered a secret treasure their boring old man doesn't know about.
B00005JNX0|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  My son loves the movie and so do we.  It will make you laugh and your kids will want to watch it over and over again.  Definitely worth owning.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to buy this album, given the Amazon review above.   Even listening to the samples, I felt the darkness and gloom of this album, and at the time, it didn't really appeal to me.   However, being a huge Beck fan, wanting to collect anything and everything Beck, I eventually received \\"Sea Change\\" as a present.   Let me tell you, every single song on this album is absolutely brilliant.   After a few complete listens, the melodies and lyrics that seemed so dark will permeate in your mind!  You'll find yourself going back and listening to it over and over again!    If you don't feel like buying a \\"bummed-out, depressing Beck album\\" - buy it anyway, because the sheer beauty of the album will outshine any gloom you might initially feel.   This is probably my new favorite of all of Beck's albums.   If you're a fan of \\"Mutations\\" (my former favorite), then you'll love \\"Sea Change\\".
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Love is a terrible thing, Not a cruel terrible but a hard heavy terrible.  Love has very good times and it has the worst, so seldom a balance of the two.  And in this movie you feel deep in your stomach, the same ache Ennis and Jack felt because you yourself have felt it once in your life, or may one day.
B000003TAW|5.0|The Blue Album. Ah. so many memories. the first time i heard this album was the first great dork rock album I had ever heard. Weezer put out one of the strongest debuts of the past 20 years with the Blue Album, and almost immediately got large amounts of critical acclaim and steadfast fans. For me, the ultimate weezer album will always be Pinkerton, but they are definitely known best by this album. <br /> <br />It starts off with a kick with My Name Is Jonas. It is actually one of the weaker songs on the album, but it is a decent intro. No One Else is my favorite song on the album. It is a slow but catchy song about wanting a girl who is completely devoted to the singer, Rivers Cuomo. The World Has Turned and Left Me Here is a slow, depressing, but spectacular song about feeling left behind in the world, a feeling we have all felt at some point. The next song is one that everyone knows, Buddy Holly. It is an anthemic and poppy song, and just generally a fun one. One of the best on the album. Next is the Sweater Song. ok, so here's the thing. I hate this song. Everyone knows it, everyone loves it, but something about it just grates on me. So we just wont talk about that song.  <br /> <br />Surf Wax America is a fun, summery song that I always like to put on driving on a nice day. Say It Ain't So is a big slow song, and is definitely one of my favorites. In My Garage, though, is my favorite on the album. It is another song about feeling alone in the world, and hiding in a place where you can feel safe. Such a great song. Holiday, while being a good song, is another low point. Only In Dreams, however, is a great closer, beautifully written and wonderfully performed. The end of that song always leaves me happy, reminding me of the first time i ended this album. One of the more influential albums in life for me <br /> <br />in the end, this band is expert at pop arrangements, catchy songs, and universal lyrics. we all have some things in us that respond to weezer's songs, and for me, this album will remind me of all the good times i had in the past 10 years or so. highly recommended for anyone interested in indie, dork rock, or just weezer in general
0140187650|5.0|Hannah Arendt's EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM:A REPORT ON THE BANALITY OF EVIL is an important book for those who want to know why terrible evil can exist among \\"decent\\" people.  What is frightening is that  Arendt makes clear that mass murders in Eastern Europe were done in compliance with existing law.  Miss Arendt has done a masterful job in attempting to explain these events and the disturbing question, \\"why.\\"    Miss Arendt gives a brief summary of Adolf Eichmann's life and career.  She also gives the background of the German bureaucracy and the tragic willingness of  \\"normal\\" people to submit to the law and bueaucratic  procedures that led to concentration camps and mass murder.    One of the most disturbing sections of the book begins on page 117 in which Miss Arendt gives a horrifying example that mass murders in German occupied Europe were done with the sanction of the victims.  She explains that leaders of Jewish councils cooperated with German authorties in a triage effort in herding victims to the concentration camps.  This section reveals what happens when \\"decent\\" people exert serious efforts to prove that they can obey the law even if the law means their own destruction.  These comments are followed by similiar remarks on page 137 whereby Miss Arendt remarks, ...the odd notion, indeed very common in Germany, that to be law-abiding means not merely to obey the laws but to act as though one were the legislator of the laws that one obeys. Hence the conviction that nothing less than going beyond the call of duty will do.\\"  These remarks partailly explain the subtitle of the book, A REPORT ON THE BANALITY OF EVIL.    Yet, as depressing as this book is, Miss Arendt cites examples of rare courage in German occupied Europe during World War II.  Miss Arendt cites the Danes who in effect said that they would no longer comply with German law, and a few Danes openly resisted efforts to arrest and convey Jews to concentration camps.  This is an important part of the bookin that it explains what can occur when petty minded bureaucrats meet with open defiance based on principle.  Miss Arendt reveals what many thought was \\"toughness\\" was merely,... \\"a ruthless desire to comform at any price...\\"      Miss Arendt does not give anyone, Germans nor allies, a free pass in this book.  She explains in the last section of the book that, under international law, the \\"allies\\" committed acts of deliberate violence against civilians.  These remarks are in line with A.J.P. Taylor's remark, \\"Though none were innocent, all were guilty.\\"      Those who complain that Hannah Arendt excuses Eichmann need to read this book more carefully.  Miss Arendt explains that \\" a nobody\\" like Adolf Eichmann became a \\"paper shuffling\\" bureaucratic who never shot or directly killed any of his victims.  What these critics need to understand is that men who rise to powerful positions do so only because \\"normal\\" people support such men and fall over themselves to prove they can obey the law.  \\"Normal\\" people refuse to question basic issues of morality and good versus evil.  Too many people accept the dangerous notion that morality is whatever is defined by political leaders and their laws.  Such evil leaders only get power and keep it because of mass support and the notion that somehow thoughtlessness is a virtue.    This reviewer highly recommends this book.  When the question is asked why terrible, tragic events occured during the interwar years and during World War II, Hannah Arendt's EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM provides insight and some of the answers.
0385507755|5.0|I thought the book was very interesting. James has gone through some serious stuff. I think any one with an addiction should read this book. It will give u the strenght to get through it, Because you can. In this book James makes that very clear.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|The look of this film is a bit darker is definitely has more of a goth look than the previous Batman film. I do not think this movie was as good as the original Batman film, it's still better than the  next 2 Batman films. Batman though is also once again upstaged by the Villains, who are played by Danny Devito as the Penguin, and MIchelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. <br />   <br /> I really liked the Michelle's Pfeiffer performance as the Catwoman, she tranformed the character from a campy sexy villain, into a tragic kind of psychotic but still sexy character. Devito did the best he could do from what he was given, but to me Burton changed the character too much for my taste. The Score by Danny Elfman is also worht mentioning, it is dark and moody kind of the like the movie although it's still not as good as his score for Edward Scissorhands. In the end this was a good film and it was also the last Batman fim directed by Burton.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|It's a really nice film. Nicely made with some brilliant child actors.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|I wish I could give this film 4 star and half, because that's what it really deserves. I think is a great film, altough is not a perfect film, it is the best of the Burton/Schumacher era of Batman movies. THe film is visually stunning. The sets and fx were all top notch for their days. Tim Burton also adds his his usual goth look to this film. THe performance by Nicholson as the JOker was really good, he was the perfect actor to play the JOker. Keaton does okay as Batman, although I feel he is upstaged by the JOker in this film. The rest of the cast also do quite well.<br /><br />  IN the end this was a great, entertaining Batman film, although it was not very faithful to the comics, it did make people forget about the campy 1960's Adam West Batman.
B000AM6MKU|5.0|THE GIFT BOX SNOW GLOBE & TOY TRAIN WERE VERY NICE! <br />MY GRANDSON LOVED IT ! VERY NICE CHRISTMAS STORY SHOULD BE  <br />AROUND FOR A LONG TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION !
B000B5XOXY|2.0|This was the Begining of the decline for Batman. What can I say, the Batman films changed a lot, from dark gothic and moody, to well campy. The I'm not gonna blame the actors for this film, I think most of them did the best they could with the material the were given. I actually kind of thought that Jim Carrey as the riddler was kind of fun, but that's the only positive thing about this film. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw an episode of the early 90's Batman the animated series, you'll realize how much more serious and interesting those episodes were than this movie. Damn I miss that show. But I do not miss Mr Schumacher directing Batman, in fact I am glad he is no longer directing them.  Once again the actors did the best they could with what they had, let's take a look at Tommy lee JOnes, he is a really godd academy award winning actor, but the two face character was really downplayed in this movie. The riddler was funny but not funny enough to save this. Oh and the bat suits, well what can I say about them that hasn't already been said before. Im not gonna say much more other than I though this film was awful. <br />
B00003CWPL|4.0|If you like happy endings for your movies this film may not be for you. <br />If you like predictable plots with a start, middle and end this film may not be for you. <br />If you think films in black and white are too old fashioned for you this film may not be for you. <br />If you need characters you can empathize with this film may not be for you. <br />But if you're a horror (not slasher) fan, and especially a fan of the unique vision of Mr. Lynch, then this is as good (and dark) as it gets.
0811826848|5.0|There really isn't much to say about this book other than the fact that it is the best Beatles book out there.  It is told by The Beatles, and has so many fantastic photos that are so awesome.  It goes through the span of The Beatles career year through year, and describes many great stories, and gives some background information to some of their songs which is cool.  It is so cool though, because you really get to see how wise and intellegant the members of The Beatles were.  You really don't need any other Beatles book than this one, so buy it!
0307236722|4.0|great book, the only recommendation is for it to be  spiral bound so it is easier to follow recipes and cook.
0793518326|5.0|This book is fantastic!  It really has every song, for really every intrument! I can spend hours with this book because it has so much great stuff in it. I play bass, and I am having so much fun learning the bass to the songs. I also know very basic guitar, and this book is able to teach me new chords which is fantastic. But really, if you are a Beatles fan, and are a musician wanting to learn how to play some of their songs, this book is fantastic. This book really just blows me away!
0792163710|5.0|Before you go ahead and trash a bonafide classic American western try this first: actually watch the movie from the beginning! This movie doesn't deserve to get it's star rating lowered from somebody who actually admitted in their 'review' that they only watched the last two minutes of the movie! Be a little bit more responsible before you start dishing out your 1 stars.
6305078564|3.0|I was so looking forward to receiving the special edition of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  I have it on VHS and just love it.  But the DVD is a huge disappointment.  I don't know what was done, but the colors are nearly washed out.  The outdoor scenes look as though they were very over-exposed, and the sound is terrible.  I was just heartsick about it and returned the copy to Amazon. <br /> <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The VHS was great, the DVD will be spectacular. Now the problem -when can you puchase it? Hmmmmmmmmm. After checking reliable sites worldwide (including all international Amazon sites), the releases date varies from as early as 1-31-2006 to 5-26-2006 (the majority seem to say mid February). <br />So, 2010? Nope. That's an Amazon default when they don't know the release date. It will be out this year, but keeps getting pushed back due to authoring and quality issues. Nevertheless, when all is finished, it will be THE DVD release of 2006. Way too long in the making agreed, but it will be worth the wait. <br />As of this point, I'm going with February 24th; we'll see if I'm right...................
B000BTJDG2|4.0|Spooky, Creepy, Scary, Suspense are words that describe The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  Based on a true story this film \\"scares the stuffin\\" out of you the old fashioned way . . . with suspense.  It proves that a film need not be a slasher movie to be frightening.  Nor does a film need to be stupid.  This film, set as a courtroom drama, delivers its emotional punch while presenting the viewer with a thought provoking subject, the conflict between religion and science.  The film also manages to treat religion in a respectful manner without forcing viewers to believe.  The director does a wonderful job of completing a task that at the first seems impossible.<br /><br />The film has its problems.  It probably isn't gory enough for teens raised on slasher films.  It probably is too frightening for the youngest viewers.  Its title probably will discourage thoughtful viewers who shy away from horror flicks.  It doesn't leave the viewer with a \\"feel good' ending, appreciated by those who go to the movies for light escapism.<br /><br />In short, it is a good film, but might be overlooked by people conditioned toward formula films.  It attempts to be a horror film for thinking persons.  Is there a market for such a production?  Only time will tell.
B000059XUP|2.0|Well, i rented this from the video store, and i am awfully glad i used a coupon to do so! this movie could have been so much better.<br /><br />Summary: Single dad Ashe and his son Danny witness a murder. Following their bosses orders to not leave any witnesses, the thigs murder the two, then throw their bodies in the harbor. Ashe comes back to avenge his and his sn's death. He's helped by Sarah, who i think is supposed to be the orginal Sarah from the orginal movie. Eventually, Ashe goes up against Judah, the very odd drug lord.<br /><br />What i liked: Well..not a lot honestly. The look was pretty cool, and the first part had me watching. Sybil, the blind girl, was interesting. And i liked the moments with the little girl, Grace. I was glad to see Sarah was in this.<br /><br />What i didnt like: the story just didnt grab me after a while. to be honest, it seemed like the screenplay writer was a bit confused as to what to do between Ashe and Sarah. you could tell had Ashe not be doomed to go back to the dead, there might have been a relationship. But that just wouldn't have fit. The bad guys were pathetic, except for Kali, she was pretty good. Even Judah. It seemed they tried to make him almost godlike, and that dosn't work very well.<br /><br />Sarah: she was weaker then i thought she'd be. I mean, if thats the Sarah from the orginal, then they changed her.<br /><br />Its worth a look, since it's the second movie, but i wouldn't buy it. Rent it from the video store
0743454529|2.0|I gave this writing two stars, which would undoubtedly surprise anyone who had talked with me while reading the first 90% of the book.  Prior to starting the book, I had read the short dust jacket intro and I felt pretty clear on where I stood, morally speaking, on the issue of compulsive organ/tissue donation, not to mention the \\"creation\\" of one child to save the life of another.  As I read the book, however, I found it to be so well-written and so thought-provoking that I found myself reaching deeper and deeper into myself to understand just exactly what and why I believe what I told myself at the beginning.  The twists and turns were intriguing, and I really felt as if I was IN that place, watching this hearbreaking situation.  That, in my admittedly humble opinion, is the hallmark of a FABULOUS book and I was looking forward to reading more of this author's works.<br /><br />The last several chapters, however, were (as previously stated) simply unforgivable.  Previous reviewers have pretty well described the ending.  Gratuitous, capricious, unnecessary.....to this I will add one more adjective.  Deflating.  The ending made a mockery of all the \\"struggle\\" that both characters and reader had gone through and ruined whatever appeal the book had originally held.  It was truly disturbing, not just for the plot line, but that a great book could be so throughly ruined.  I will not read another of this author's works.
0618526412|1.0|This is the most boring book I have ever read. I kept hoping something would happen and nothing ever did. I only cared about two of the characters out of about 5 featured and I was shocked to find that nothing ever really brought them together. I wasn't expecting a John Grisham thriller here, but I did expect to at least enjoy reading the book or even have something to think about after I was finished. By the time the last 20 pages came, I found myself just skimming to get to the end so that I could say I finished it and that my opinion was valid. All I thought about was how many hours I wasted reading it. Sorry, but it was that bad!!!
B00008WT5E|5.0|Powerage is AC/DC's most underrated album of the Bon Scott era (1974- February 19th 1980) and is at the same time there best album in terms of studio recording. After capturing the world's attention in 77 with the thundering guitars in Let There Be Rock, Malcolm and Angus turned down the marshal amps and channel the raw aggression into Riff Raff giving you a 50's era feel.  <br /> <br />This is a must for any AC/DC fan. I recommend this Album along with Flick of the Switch because both capture the band before and after the Hype of the Mutt era (79-81) and prove that AC/DC is the best in there field of music without heavy promotion.
B000003TAL|5.0|This was my first album of its kind, and my introduction to Sonic Youth in general.  It's amazing, it's beautiful, it's comforting, it's disturbing, it's hard, it's soft.  It's cathartic.   <br /> <br />I don't know if I can recommend this more highly. It's a shame that Amazon.com's rating system only goes up to five stars.  They should have a special six star option reserved for albums like Loveless, Disintegration, OK Computer, Closer, Funeral, Nowhere, and, of course, Daydream Nation.
B000065BPB|5.0|After using assorted earbud headphones (from the one's that ship with iPods to high dollar units), these headphones are the best I have heard and a steal at $100.   While not quite as portable as earbud setup, well worth the extra weight in your laptop bag. <br /> <br />The over the ear design provides exceptional bass (and all frequencies) sound.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This film harkens back to the old days of horror films which were loaded with blood and good old-fashioned terror.  Many of today's horror films have left out much of the blood, but that is not the case with \\"Saw\\". <br /> <br />Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves in a very dirty and unkept bathroom, each chained at opposite ends of the bathroom  to a pipe.  There is a dead man in the middle of the bathroom, lying in a pool of blood and clutching a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other.  After overcoming their initial shock, Lawrence and Adam decide that they must work together in order to get out alive. They begin to search the bathroom for anything that might help them escape, but the only items they find are two hacksaws that prove to be worthless in cutting through the chains that are holding each man to their respective pipes.  Each man discovers that they have a small cassette tape in their pockets.  After retrieving the cassette player from the dead man, Lawrence discovers that in order to survive, he must kill Adam before the clock on the wall reaches 6:00. Also, Lawrence finds out that his wife and daughter have been taken hostage, and they will be killed if Lawrence fails to kill Adam.  This sets off a desperate race against the clock to try to escape, as well as finding out the identity of their captor.  Will Lawrence and Adam survive?  Will Lawrence kill Adam? <br /> <br />This movie is very good.  The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.  A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.  The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.  Watch this movie and try to guess what will happen next.
B000035P7X|5.0|If you dig Bob Dylans music, or are into good rock documentaries, than you will most surely like DONT LOOK BACK. Although not very in depth in the sense that NO DIRECTION HOME, the most recent offering is... this one instead just follows a young Bob Dylan through his 1964 European tour. You get to watch the man at fun and at work, galavanting around Europe with the likes of Joan Baez and Donovan. Its all in a very stylish black and white, and is very fun to watch.<br /><br />The way Bob Dylan gives the subtle F*** YOU to every single reporter that crosses his path, is entertainment enough. But you get him arguing with unruly fans, acoustic battling with Donovan, and just amazing the crowd onstage.<br /><br />D.A PENNEMAKER gets down and deep into the crazy touring life of Bob Dylan in the sixties. Also, we get a sense of the rock and roll business, through up close dealings with John Hammond, Dylans manger at the time. The movie is a good time, if you are into rock docs, you gotta see this one!
0385335482|5.0|I just couldn't stop reading this book.  This book has a really nice tempo and you can't just stop reading.  It reminded me of my age of 20s.  I was just like her when it comes to shopping.  I shared a lot of things with Becky, yes, shopping on bargen actually is a saving!!
B0000691TJ|5.0|Perhaps the fact that the newest member of THE RAMONES at the time, RICHIE RAMONE was a crazy, uppaced drummer, or perhaps it was the fact that DEE DEE RAMONE had a slew of inspired compositions to put out, but 1984's TOO TOUGH TO DIE is nothing short of a punk rock/hard rock masterpiece.<br />RICHIE RAMONE replaced MARKY RAMONE and added a whole new intensity and speed to the groups sound. In fact, it was sort of a problem for the band in the mid eighties, because the speed of the drumming was knocking twenty minutes or so off of their live set time. However the sound was pisser. I really like blaring this album in the car- It rocks like a bomb! TOMMY RAMONE, the original drummer, produced this one, and really proved his skills behind the boards, as this is probably the best production job ever done on a RAMONES record. Full sound, everything is mixed perfectly. There is a touch of electronica on songs like CHASING THE NIGHT and HOWLING AT THE MOON, but they don't hurt the integrity at all. Those songs still rock, but the angrier, grittier tracks are what makes this album shine, MAMAS BOY, the title track, DURANGO 95... damn they're all good. DEE DEE sings on ENDLESS VACATION, and also on alternate versions of most of his songs, that are included on the umpteen bonus tracks included on this release. Well worth a peek.
0307276902|5.0|Interestingly, the details of this story that have been called into question have little to do with the main message and that is about struggling with adddiction.  This is eye opening and has helped thousands of people whether they have been the addicts or those who love and hate the addicts. <br />I'm not sure how many of you can recall with unquestionable accuracy the events that happened ten years ago when you were strung out on drugs and alcohol.  I'd also question how many of you can recall with accuracy the events of last Thursday when you had no drugs or alcohol. People overreact to minor faults or failures and lose the greater gift.  This book is fabulous and written with a wonderfully engaging style.  Take the gifts and leave the rest. <br />
B000002LHT|5.0|Definately in MY top five RAMONE picks. BRAIN DRAIN was the last album to officially include member DEE DEE RAMONE on bass, and perhaps has some of his best licks. This bit was released in 1989 and was the first album on the Chrysalis label.<br /><br />During the eighties THE RAMONES became more of a rock and roll outfit when it came to studio recordings. You get louder guitars, and a richer sound than you will hear on the classic seventies punk recordings of the band. The best songs on this disc are DEE DEE compositions, the opening I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES is a very cool rocker. PET SEMETARY also a rockin' song. DEE DEE had a hell of a lot of problems, but the man could pen a great song. Hell, he even wrote most of the songs for the band AFTER he left for the next few albums. However, BRAIN DRAIN is his swan song. The same year he would also release a solo album of rap songs- I have never found that piece, but I would really like to! HA HA!<br /><br />BRAIN DRAIN also features lots of other great songs like DONT BUST MY CHOPS and JOEY RAMONE favorites CAN'T GET YOU OUTTA MY MIND and MERRY CHRISTMAS (I DONT WANNA FIGHT TONIGHT). Then the icing on the cake is a sweet sweet cover of Gong Show ChucK Barris' PALISADES PARK which really cooks. Take a ride on the Shoop-de-shoop! DIG THIS ALBUM! One of THE RAMONES best for sure!
B000003BF1|3.0|Why is the original order of songs scrambled on this re-release?

0385507755|1.0|It has come to light that portions of this book, labeled as a memoir, are untrue and never happened.  The integrity of the author appears to be compromised.  Mr. Frey: perhaps you should take some time to familiarize yourself with the definition of what a non-fiction book should be; maybe you should even publish your next work under the \\"fiction\\" category.

1400031087|1.0|In an effort to draw more attention to the discrepencies in James frey's book, Million Little Pieces, I ask that you consider the comments of folks who are famailiar with the non legal aspects of the subject matter. I am taking the time to broaden the discussion because the legal details are not the most serious matter regarding this book. <br /> <br />Respecting the anonymity of the authors, I post these comments from another website: <br /> <br />Ok, why has no one investigated whether Frey was actually at Hazelden ? I was there, and I don't recognize the place from his description. Being able to call anyone you want with a free phone when detoxing ? Not a chance ? People screaming all night in detox ? Not according to a counselor I spoke with who worked there for twenty years. Says he never heard anyone scream in detox there in twenty years... Going with his counselor to a crack house ?No, no way in hell would anyone at Hazelden have let Frey do that. This guy was never there. His book is a total sham and someone needs to get to the bottom of the Hazelden problem. <br /> <br />And this: <br /> <br />I am wondering whether Frey was ever at Hazelden. There are a couple of scenes in which Frey said he had to clean his counselor's toilets.. he gets into a fight with another patient who says he isn't doing a good job cleaning. But I talked to someone who has been on staff at Hazelden for 20 years. Turns out patients have never had to clean toilets.. a professional cleaning service does. So those scenes with the macho guys duking it out over the toilets goes out the window... I have talked to people who were in rehab there and they say the prison gang-like cliques Frey describes is a load of b.s. I think it's possible that Frey himself was never at Hazelden. <br /> <br />Finally,for your consideration, I submit this: <br /> <br />This post is getting closer to the whole truth. <br /> <br />Have you read both of Frey's books? <br /> <br />What if someoone told you thathis decription of Hazeldon doesn't jive with anything that exists in reality? <br /> <br />Screaming in the detox center? Really..... <br /> <br />Dental surgery without anesthesia? Sure... <br /> <br />Counseler supported raids on abandoned houses full of crack depraved degenerates? My, my. <br /> <br />Even a physical desciption that frankly doesn't reflect the layout of the rehab he claims to have stayed at? <br /> <br />That's pretty scary. <br /> <br />What if Leonard doesn't exist? <br /> <br />What if Lilly didn't exist? <br /> <br />What if, as the Smoking Gun implies, Frey never spent even one night in jail? <br /> <br />In light of his scathing attack on the traditonal approach to recovery, an approach that millions of truly addicted folks owe their very survival to, wouldn't it be a service to research the whole book before some poor, newly recovering person buys into this \\"memoir\\" and ends up dead? <br /> <br />Willpower kept him sober? This is the central and deadly theme of this book,plying on the wallets of the disenfranchised, the hopeless, the addicted. <br /> <br />Is it a crime? <br /> <br />I would welcome a deeper investigation into this book. It might save someone's life to realize that this biography is full of fictitious storytelling and, possibly, very dangerous advice to a very vulnerable audience with alot to lose.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I think this CD is great. It has one of their most famous songs, <br />Sultans of Swing. Also, Down to the Waterline, Lions, & the rest <br />are good. The only bad song on this CD is In the Gallery. I also <br />own this record on LP and it's excellent. This CD is a must have classic. One of the best of the late 70's.
B000002GWJ|5.0|This is my favorite Tom Waits album, by far!  This and Foreign Affair are the epitome of the greatest poetry vinyl has ever seen.  Tom beats Dylan by a few, and blows Springsteen out of the water with this masterpiece!  Listen to \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" for the gentleness of the beast (and what imagery!), \\"$29.00\\" for it's blase approach to a savage world, and Wrong Side of the Road for it's solution to a hopeless life (and what an ending!).  This is the tightest band you'll ever hear, and if you like jazz/beat/blues music you definitely should check this out!  It's in the top ten of my all time favorite albums for sure!   <br /> <br />The Eagles have covered Tom's work ('Ol 55), Manhattan Transfer covered \\"Foreign Affair\\", and Springsteen has covered his \\"Jersey Girl\\". Artists love Tom.   <br /> <br />After Blue Valentine Tom started going a different direction, one that didn't impress me.  Some like his later work (SwordfishTrombones and later) sounded like alot of banging on pots and pans if you want my opinion!  I'll take Blue Valentines and Foreign Affair ANY TIME compared to his later stuff.  <br /> <br />I found out that a friend of mine loved the song \\"Foreign Affair\\" by Manhattan Transfer, and I gave him the original on the CD by Waits and it blew him away!  He couldn't believe that a \\"beat poet\\" like Tom could write such exquisite lyrics!  And I agree, Tom is the best poet/musician ever recorded, and \\"Foreign Affair\\" is the best of that genre I've ever heard.  Don't believe me, check it out for yourself!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I think this is their essential CD, not stupid Brothers in Arms. <br />Brothers in Arms is good for MTV. This is a much better record. <br />This one has 5 terrific songs. But the best songs are Industrial <br />Disease, & It Never Rains. But still, I think the greatest song <br />of all time must be Hey Jude by The Beatles, and will always be. <br />Telegraph Road is a great song but a little too long. My favorite <br />record along with On Every Street. <br />
B00005JLEJ|5.0|While I would not quite rate \\"Kagemusha\\" itself a 5-star movie, the DVD itself (in terms of presentation, transfer and content) clearly rates it. <br /> <br />An excellent transfer and crisp, spare sound draw you into the melancholy world of Kagemusha.  Make no mistake, this is not one of Kurosawa's happy films.  But his use of color, sound and character are heart-breaking and wonderful. <br /> <br />The background material puts you right into the darkened mind of Kurosawa when he created the film.  Documentary includes interviews with Coppola and Lucas, who were influenced by Kurosawa.  The extra content also helps you understand and appreciate what can be a difficult film at times.  It's like a key to unlock a great wooden door. <br /> <br />I own several of the other Criterion Kurosawa editions and this is as good or better than anything to date.   <br /> <br />
0440418569|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is the final book in Philip Pullman's `His Dark Materials' trilogy. The series is breathtaking in its scope and audacity. There are parallel's to JRR Tolkien's Lord Of the Rings in that the first book introduces us to the characters, the action in the second takes place in the shadow of the impending war, while the final book deals with the war itself. The children can be seen as Hobbits re-interpreted. There is something deeper here than what appears to the casual reader, however. Lyra Silvertongue is Ulyssean both in her adventures in multiple worlds, as well as in her uncanny ability to deceive with an unerring choice of the right words at the right time, when it serves her purpose. This then is a truly epic work. It is said that Tolkien wanted to create a mythology for the British Isles. Pullman has his sights set on no less than a new humanistic Christian theology. The action is a framework to expound these ideas. And these are not for the faint of heart! In this book you will learn the nature of life, of death and the soul. Heaven and Hell are described. Tellingly, Pullman advocates a Republic rather than a Kingdom of Heaven. Like Odysseus, Lyra visits the underworld which is more the early Greek kind than Christian. Harpies are thrown in gratis. You will learn the true nature of angels. There is an effort to achieve a synthesis of science and religion, which may appeal to many readers. Certainly this is a thinking person's theology. An excursion into evolution on an alien planet (where some of the action plays out) merits discussion in Richard Dawkin's scholarly volume of evolutionary biology `The Ancestor's Tale'. This is high praise, because Dawkins unsparingly criticizes flawed logic wherever he sees it. He seems respectful of Pullman's ideas. The concept in question, by the way, is how a biological wheel might evolve. Intrigued? What has this to do with Lyra (the central character, identified as a modern Eve) and the fantasy genre to which these books belong? Nothing, possibly, or a lot. This is a book about EVERYTHING (with apologies to Seinfeld, i.e. the show about nothing) and if you are a thinker these books are for you. You will find a wealth of radical concepts to work through. Children will look back on these books for decades, as new life experiences prompt them to re-examine various ideas. And so if you have read the first two books you will need no special encouragement to read this one. It does not disappoint and all questions are finally answered.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I boughtthe firefly DVD's bacause I was bored one day, and then I fell in love.  This movie is one of the most imaginitive things I have EVER seen.  This action/comedy is WOW!  But if you get the movie you should also get the show \\"Firefly\\" because it mores the movie much more fun and easy to understand
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|The Adam Sandler Sports Movie...whether he's cracking golf balls hockey-style, or cracking heads on the football field, there is little new or wrong with The Longest Yard.  It has all the signature Sandler movie cliches, but with the strong supporting cast, I think was worth 2 hours of my time.<br /><br />Chris Rock makes the movie, period.  His comic relief pokes fun at a movie that already makes fun of itself, adding credibility on some weird level.<br /><br />There are also some of the largest human beings I have ever seen on film in this one.  \\"Turley\\" makes The Rock look like a preschooler.<br /><br />A good watch, very entertaining...really, I don't think I have seen a completely BAD sports movie.  Except Major League 3, which stunk on so many levels I can't even begin to cover it here. Guaranteed you'll enjoy this one, or your rental money back, just go to Blockbuster and tell 'em I sent ya.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best thing I have ever seen on TV (along with \\"Band of Brothers\\", but I'm a soldier and a little partial)  Firefly is funny, well written, action packed. and a LOT of fun.  Both firefly and serinity got great reviews by all the critics.  There is a reson.  It is the same reason no one has given it less than five stars here.  It is that good.
0553269631|5.0|This book came to me in a odd way. It was mentioned in the movie \\"A love song for Bobby Long\\". Never thought it was a real book. But googling for the title (just out of curiosity) I found it. Got very curious after having read a couple of reviews and bought it. It cost me a sleepless night. I couldn't put it down and read it in one breath. It has such an impact that it leaves one breathless. What an astounding story it is. It boggles my mind how such a young woman in 1940 (she was 23 at the time the book was published) could come up with such a novel.<br /><br />My question is also: what has changed in the meantime, as to the social circumstances of the poor? Nothing whatsoever. It's frustrating that I cannot come up with anything original to add in this review, as far too many 5 star reviewers have already done that. It comes down to  a repitition of words like:<br /><br />astounding, remarkable, extraordinary, impressive, beautiful and bittersweet: ALL TRUE.<br /><br />People who are looking for a plot, are looking for easy reading and have a totally dream-like idea of how life can be.<br /><br />Wake up people and experience truth. Take up the book again after a couple of years, and see if it will make sense by then.<br /><br />If you read this book, you will be totally shaken by this story of beauty and darkness.<br /><br />Carson Mccullers is a genius to have written this story at such a young age.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|I can't believe everyone I see whining aobut hte gore or not enough there is no pleasing everyone and this is definetley not for all tastes. I also read someone say this had a typical Hollywood ending I say hogwash to that a typical ending would be to try and be sneaky and clever and just end up being stupid aka the Skeleton Key, Darkness. I love the carnage has all my favorites chainsaws, wrenches, Claws, shears and even a blowtorch. Way better than Saw which is also a great film.
0307276902|1.0|James Frey was not the \\"Criminal\\" he portrays as his real life (Memoir-Schem-oir!)  He was a boring frat boy who drank a little too much.  His rich daddy could pay for rehab.  He stole the \\"Criminal\\" \\"Bad-Boy\\" aspect of AMLP (which runs through the entire book) from the writings of a real criminal and junkie, Eddie Little, who wrote Another Day In Paradise.  This book should be re-named as \\"A Million Pieces of Eddie Little\\" because that's what the book really is.  James Frey was living in LA in 1997 and 1998, trying to become a screenwriter, while Eddie Little's column, \\"Outlaw LA\\", was being published in the LA Weekly.  James Frey - after reading this column - 'married' his own hum-drum rehab experience with the real, gritty experiences and life of Eddie Little (now deceased - died of a drug overdose / stopped heart).  Frey even 'stole' Little's staccato way of writing a scene or a sentence.  The proof is there - in the \\"Outlaw LA\\" columns by Eddie Little, and in Another Day In Paradise.  The American public -- an Oprah - have be been duped!! Fooled by a lying no-so-hard-core addict, James Frey.   It's hard to `get into' this book when you know 80% or more of it is all fabricated lies, and stolen scenes (from Eddie Little's life).
B00005JOFO|5.0|From the moment the first credits appear on the screen a hush comes over the house. The audience is totally immersed in the film from beginning to end. No cat calls or ohhhs or ahhhhh no snickering just very attentive and interested. America is growing up! The story is very touching and will probably make many men look at thier passing thoughts of other men more closely than before and make them understand the stigma of homosexuality is not what they had believed. Go see this movie! You will totaly enjoy it coming out with a new view of the world.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|The current version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" starring Keira Knightley is a travesty. Do not see it in a theater, buy it, rent it, or watch it on television. It was a waste of time and electricity to make, and will be a waste of your time to see.     There was a full-length version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" filmed in 1995, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, that remains not only unsurpassed but unequaled. It is perfectly adapted, cast, directed, acted, costumed, filmed, and scored. It preserves not only Jane Austen's intent, but the dialogue she wrote. Buy it and watch it instead.     When she starred in the 1995 film, Miss Ehle did not have the blandly \\"beautiful\\" features or skeletal body of a model. She was, nevertheless, captivating as Elizabeth Bennet. The beauty--spiritual, intellectual, and physical--of the character she portrays increases in our esteem as we get to know her, just as it does in Darcy's. Elizabeth, as written by Austen and portrayed by Jennifer Ehle, was a mature and fascinating young woman, not a giggly,  petulant teenager with an eating disorder.     Keira Knightley looks desperately in need of nourishment, and the \\"lollipop-head\\" figure does not work for the character she is playing. It's hard to believe that a girl of Elizabeth Bennet's time, place, and social class could have grown up so emaciated, unless she had a tapeworm.      And, finally, there are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" for its \\"realistic\\" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Just F**cking Open your ears and flush the toilet that is in your head.
1400032717|5.0|This book, especially the second time through, is very sad.  The author is very sensitive to the subtleties of emotion.  By filtering a series of events through the lens of someone with an emotional handicap, he has managed to make the story even more poignant.  However, it is not so complex that you have to have an English degree to study it.  Great for book clubs!
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I dont like to write reviews about movies.  However in this case I will make an exception. This movie was a jumbled mass of complete garbage.  I have read all of the original brothers grimm stories and they are in itself dark enough in their original form to hold up a modern movie. But dont expect any continuity of plot from any one grimm story.  Dont expect that any one point in the movie really makes sense.  At times the story is so dark people dying left and right and the main characters are marveling at the special effects.  Half of the time I was wondering if one of the brothers was retarded or mentally impaired.  Usually if a movie is this bad I would walk away and start washing the dishes or something.  However this was so bad that I just stood there in shock.
B0000041LO|4.0|No doubt that Haydn is one of the greatest composers of all times both in terms of quality and quantity of his diverse compositions.I have always found his piano sonatas very witty and enjoyable having listened to Jando and Richter.I was completely floored by one of the Haydn's Piano trios featured in the Stern,Rose and Istomin recording of the Schubert Piano Trios-Perky,springy,Bouncy playing keeping the listener constantly guessing.It is with great expectation that I bought this complete set of Haydn Piano Trios by the REPUTED Beaux Arts Trio.Listening to the First 2 CDs of this set was a bit of a let down.I find their playing totally bland and Lifeless-Yes,they are pretty but lacking in perky,quirky humour that Haydn is justly known for.They sound like Rameau's compositions!I find that the individuality and personality of Haydn is totally absent. <br />I know that the Beaux Arts Trio has a Big Reputation but I need to say this.I found their Beethoven Trios a Trifle Bland as well.The Stern Rose Istomin Excel in that recording as well!Ditto for their Schubert Piano Trios.Just what is the Difference?I find the Stern Rose Istomin Trio play with Fresh Abandon whereas the Beaux Arts Trio seem to be too Studious,a little too serious!This robs a little bit of spontaneity and LIVING IN THE MOMENT vitality.(More so for Franz Joseph Haydn!) <br />Yes,This may be the only complete recording of the wonderful Haydn Piano Trios,but I would strongly advise that you collect the individual performances by different groups after due listening.
B000777J2S|1.0|After cruising many of the respected top of 2005 lists I came across this record and a few others of a similar style.  My conclusion, this is by far one of the worst albums that I have ever heard, ever.  I listened to all the tracks on this CD and thought it was some kind of cruel joke.    What in the world are people thinking when they rank all of these weak, weak records as top picks?  Antony and the Johnsons, Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart?  What is this stuff?  Have people gone totally insane that they now think rehashed hippie folk sounds like the most awesomest thing in the world?    Apparently all you need to win critical acclaim these days is play an acoustic guitar, sing in some weird falsetto, and whine about how horrible your existence is.
0790737345|2.0|The only reason I borrowed this film was because it featured my two favorite TV cops--Frantz and Braugher. The movie looks lovely (except for Cage's mopey eyes) and the soundtrack is great, so do what I did--go to the options, where you can turn on the subtitles, turn off the sound, and just listen to the music. As a silent film, it actually works pretty well. <br />But once is pretty much enough.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|I listen to a lot of music, a lot, and when I started seeing this on DJ lists and reviews I took the leap of faith and checked it out.  For the life of me I can't figure out why this is on the #1 slot of so many people.  This put me to sleep after ten minutes.  It just did absolutely nothing for me.    Maybe I'm too particular about the type of music I like but there are so many better things to spend your money on than weak music like this.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Critics and movie civilians alike either love or hate Rent.  I have found no middle ground.  I fall into the former column.  I became obsessed with this musical ever since I saw Adam Pascal on Rosie 10 years ago.  The music was moving (I still maintain that One Song Glory is so much better than Roger's final song) and the story was both heart-warming, yet tragic.  I was thrilled to see a more modern musical to appeal to the younger masses.  I believe Rent introduced the art of the musical to a lot of Generation X and Y, at a time when kids are engrossed in video games and the internet.   <br />I have seen Rent on stage and was thrilled to hear that they would be releasing a movie.  For 10 years, we had several scares (Justin Timberlake!) and I honestly cannot imagine how the casting and directing could have been better.  Having missed the original cast on stage, I was excited that I would get to experience the performers who first gave these characters life and dimension.  I was a little apprehensive about Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms at first (althought I loved Tracie in Wonderfalls).  They had big shoes to fill.  Not only do they fill the shoes, but they dance away in them.  Rosario lacks the vocal strength and enthusiasm of Daphne Rubin-Vega, but she holds her own (musically, and especially choreographically) with the seasoned cast and is surprisingly impressive.  The movie lacks a certain energy and character chemistry that was present on stage, however I was still moved by the performances and teary-eyed towards the end of the movie.   <br />Many critics stated that the cast seems too old (as if no one in their 30s and 40s deals with love, poverty, and grief).  Other critics complain that the movie and its theme appears dated (well, the movie is set in 1989).  I didn't realize that homelessness and AIDs were \\"dated\\" causes.  I'll make sure to pass that on to an HIV+ homeless person.  Ignore the critics.  Buy the movie and make your own decision.  But don't stop there.  To get the full Rent experience, go see the musical on stage and bring a friend (someone has to hold your tissues as you applaud).
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I love checking in on the reviews for this album from time to time. Seeing the vicious verbal wars going on gives me a good laugh. I actually wrote a prior review that was meant to directly inform a prospective buyer of what they would be getting. But now it's my turn for my 2 cents on the drama continually unfolding on this page. <br /> <br />First of all, I do not watch MTV, I never have watched MTV, I never will watch MTV, and I wouldn't even know that anything regarding Avenged Sevenfold ever crossed paths with MTV if it weren't for these reviews. My personal favorite style of music is progressive metal, which most of you have likely never had the pleasure of listening to. Dream Theater, Kamelot, etc. And I wouldn't bother to venture outside it, except that by some odd chance (a Madden NFL soundtrack, to be exact) I stumbled upon Avenged Sevenfold. Being so utterly stunned that a quality song had made the mainstream playlist of Madden, I went out to buy the album. And there was that lovely cover art... it seems reminiscient of many over-the-top 80s metal bands (Metallica, or Iron Maiden). But, like those bands, there is a lot more to Avenged Sevenfold than morbid, cheesy cover art (or their stage names, which everyone seems to take WAY too seriously). <br /> <br />So, I took a listen to the album. Yes, the singer's voice is kinda whiny. I wish it wasn't, but at least it's not unbearable. I've never found the sole important quality of music to be vocals. And then I hear people ripping on them for being un-metal 'cuz they don't sound like Slayer, Sepultra, Opeth, and the like... it's really quite ridiculous because those people clearly have get nothing more out of music than an outlet for their testosterone. Not to insult Slayer or Opeth (I have great respect for those bands), but there's a lot more to metal than that particular niche, which they give a very good name to. <br /> <br />Here's the key to this band: they are energizing, heavy (but fun), and generallyentertaining to listen to, even if some of the lyrics are depressing. I personally love the drumming, and the guitar notes are quite well written: they can be quite fast, but there is more emphasis on songwriting than anything else, unlike many other metal bands. I compare it to the difference between Dream Theater and Spiral Architect (if any of you have heard of them)... the latter has all the technical chops in the world, yet the former bests them with a combination of technicality and songwriting- basically putting a soul into the music. Avenged Sevenfold has that soul. <br /> <br />A lot of people are ripping on this band, but it is mainly because they don't like this style of metal. Maybe there are some teenie boppers out there that thinks they're cool for listening to this music, but that has nothing to do with the music itself.  Aside from some unusual vocals, this band seems to get everything right. And as a previous reviewer pointed out, everyone would have expected the singer to quit after his vocal chord surgery. But his passion for the music drove him on against the adversity. And that passion really shines through on this album.
B000002G0P|5.0|I am a fan of Extreme, no doubt about it, and was very surprise not many people even know about them except for \\"More Than Words\\". For that fact, people I've talked to thought Extreme was just some poppy acoustic sounding band, only good for singing some soppy love songs, like some bands I wouldn't mention. :p<br /><br />I have the great privildge to watch them live years ago ,you heard me, LIVE!!! at a concert in England, not too long after the release of this III Sides to Every Story ablum. Man, It was amazing, and I can still remember how memerised I was with Nuno guitar playing...listening to him is one thing, seeing him on stage was completely mind blowing!!! The whole thing was just amazing!<br /><br />The only other band which I also have the pleasure to watch \\"live\\", which I feel has the same effect for me is Incubus. But not as dramatic as Extreme, they are absolutely one of best for all time!<br /><br />You want music? Listen to these guys, way way better than many of today's similar sounding bands.<br /><br />Shame that they were not being recognised for what they were,and what they made, but hey, we do! So, Rock On, and keep Extreme's music alive!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show has everything. If your looking for romance just check out Meredith and Dr. Sheperd, or Christina and Dr. Burke, If you want conflict, Check out Dr. Sheperd and Dr. sheperd . And if your into medical dramas it has lots of that too. This show is GREAT and all the characters are likeable ( well almost all, not crazy bout the Ms. Dr. Sheperd) If you havent seen it yet then buying season one is definetely worth the money, and if you have seen it, well you already know you HAVE to own these DVDs and watch it all over again.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|This three hour movie feels more like two hours which is a good thing. I was asked to go to this movie and so i did. This movie can be divided into three segments and each consisting of about one hour. The first and most boring segment is pre Island scene where the film maker is looking for a woman to play in his film. This segment was too long and quite boring. The second segment is when they arrive on \\" Skull \\" Island and meet up with savages who look like they are either on drugs or suffer from seizures ( you take your pick ). The third scene is when Donkey Kong is captured and brought to N.Y. Therein these three scenes there are some details that should be mentioned. King Kong really likes this lady and the lady kinda likes this ugly, hairy beast of an animal. She doesn't have good taste I guess. The men are attacked by silly animals and spiders while enroute to saving this lady.  Oh, the special effects were not that special at all. I think they bit off more than they could chew. To be honest it was really bad special effects and obviously computer generated. This movie better make more money if it is going to recoup the lost investments in lousy computer special effects..
0143036556|5.0|A debate between two camps continues to rage. One side thinks that the modern world continues to careen toward a non-sustainable future and impending doom. The other group thinks that \\"environmentalists\\" exaggerate their claims about a coming ecological crash. As usual the sides remain somewhat unproductively polarized with neither giving an inch to the other. This book's title exposes where Jared Diamond's sympathies stand, but he also takes some surprisingly neutral views. For one, he claims that some contemporary businesses have in fact successfully taken environmental concerns into consideration, and that these concerns have made them money and boosted their respect globally. Diamond doesn't believe that big business and environmental groups necessarily remain indissoluble enemies. And he goes further by suggesting that environmentalists should unabashedly praise those companies that have suceeded in balancing economics with ecology. \\"Collapse\\", though admittedly more slanted towards the environmental side of the continuum, nonetheless tries to narrow the gap between the two aforementioned camps.<br /><br />\\"Collapse\\" takes the reader on a dizzying historical and global tour. The chapters weave in and out of modern, ancient, and medieval worlds. Along the way Diamond extrapolates which behaviors have threatened (or arguably are currently threatening) a significant inexorable decline in a particular society's population. By juxtaposing past and present societies he hopes to reveal the simularities between societies that no longer exist and the trends of the world today. The book surreptitously asks  whether our current world is threatened by a global collapse.<br /><br />Diamond uses a \\"five-point framework\\" to analyze various societies. These comprise certain behaviors and characterstics, namely, environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and a society's responses to its environmental problems. With these tools in hand, Diamond travels to Montana, Easter Island, the Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the ancient and medieval Anasazi cultures in North America, the Maya, Norse Greenland, New Guinea, Tikopia, Tokugawa-era Japan, Rwanda, Hispaniola, China, and Australia. Each of these societies, both past and present, receive analysis in terms of the five point framework. For example, the Greenland Norse collapsed, according to Diamond, due to all five factors. Whereas Easter Island collapsed only due to three. But Diamond also discusses past successes such as Tikopia and Tokugawa Japan. These two societies managed to control their resources and avoid the others' fate. And those fates included horrifying ends in wars, mass starvation, and sometimes cannabalism.<br /><br />The discussion of Norse Greenland receives three full length chapters (which at times seems a little too lengthy). Why? In a talk that Diamond gave for the Long Now Foundation in 2005 (downloadable from the Foundation's website), he claimed that he wanted to show that collapse doesn't only happen to non-europeans. Some skeptics may claim that collapse only happens to so-called \\"primitives\\". But the Norse Greelanders were medieval Europeans who desperately tried to hold on to their European Christian roots in Greenland, but they all ended up dying sometime in the 15th century. The reasons why remain somewhat mysterious, though archeologists have found evidence of starvation and cannabalism at the long abandoned sites. By contrast, the Greenland Inuit long outlasted the Norse.<br /><br />Diamond thinks that societies also need to re-evaluate their values to survive in different climates. In addition, when the elite begin isolating themselves that often spells trouble for a society. Diamond sees this happening in our world today (in \\"gated\\" communities and private funding for personal amenities) as well as evidence for all of the above listed five points. He argues that our current course appears unsustainable unless we take action. In the end, he does leave room for hope (as evidenced by the societies that \\"saved\\" themselves and peoples).<br /><br />Diamond also addresses the refutations often leveled against the environmental side of the spectrum. One-liners such as \\"technology will save us\\" or \\"the environment must be balanced against the economy\\" receive their own refutations. Finally, he presents justifications for his comparative method of juxtaposing and extrapolating the problems of past societies onto our own.<br /><br />Diamond never argues that the contemporary world will inevitably collapse. He does admit to seeing many danger signs. In the end, whether or not readers agree with Diamond's conclusions, the book does a good job of presenting collapse as at least one of the possible outcomes of a society's actions. Much of the modern world doesn't seem to accept or even to realize this possibility. At the very least governments and citizens need to be aware that irresponsible actions could lead to a collapse. Infinite progress and expansion isn't a given. Though this book could have included much more information (along with analyses of many more now extinct societies), it provides a good foundation for thinking and debate on this increasingly important subject. And though it has its flaws \\"Collapse\\" nonetheless represents a book that environmental skeptics will have to contend with.room for hope (as evidenced by the societies that \\"saved\\" themselves and peoples).

B000BB1MI2|1.0|Sometimes a great actor needs to know when he cannot save a film; especially if he is part of the problem. Whether this was Burton's skewed vision or Depp's worst decision since Private Resort, this movie bored me to sleep. Depp's deadpan reprisal of Gene Wilders brilliantly warm and touching performance left me feeling like the novocaine would never wear off. I can't even remeber the last time I turned off a movie half way through. This movie can only be appreciated by adolescent youth who have never seen the original and have no frame of reference for how badly Burton butchered this timeless classic. Tim, Tim, Tim...Corpse Bride, Chocolate Factory, Big Fish, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks? Get a clue and get back on track. Remember Edward Scissorhands; it was his last great movie. Let us hope that he does a better job with Robert Ripley's life story.

B00009UW0N|4.0|This review would probably be best read by those who've already seen the film.<br /><br />Just so you don't think I'm a complete idiot, I will admit to this film's merrits: It's music score is on of the most chilling ones ever composed before. It makes exellent use of shadows and dark places and closed-in spaces, and the chase scene at the end is certainly terrifying. If you're not already afraid of the dark, this movie just might make you be. Still, this film has definete flaws, and it surprises me no one eles has ever seemed to notice this before.<br /><br />First of all, the characters aren't very well developed. Let me ask you this: without re-checking, either by looking up imbd.com or by re-watching the film, can you recall just by memory any of the names of Laurie's friends? Did they have any really distinctive personality traits? Yes I know this sort of thing of having 2-dimentional characters who you can barely tell apart was true in almost all slasher films from this one up until SCREAM (that is, with the exception of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films,) but then other slashers aren't made out to be such flawless masterpieces like this one.<br /><br />Then there's the gaps in logic. Again, I'm well aware this was a problem most other slashers throughout the 1980s had, but because almost nobody ever aknowleges Halloween's faults, I just thought it was time someone did.<br /><br />1.How DOES Micheal know how to drive if he's been locked up since he was six? When the question is brought up, Dr. Loomis simply says,\\"Maybe someone gave him lessons.\\" Like who? Another inmate, who just decided one day to give lessons to a seemingly unresponsive boy, and without being able to take him outside the halls of the institution, and would only be able to describe the steps of driving a car without being able to show him? Somehow I kind of doubt that.<br /><br />2.Exactly how is it that Micheal is able to survive getting stabbed in the neck, shot six times and falling one story to the ground? He's a guy who escaped from the loony bin, he hasn't been brought back from the dead, and he sure as hell ain't the terminator. And no, he's NOT \\"the boogeyman\\".<br /><br />3.After seeing Micheal come back to life after stabbing him in the neck, Laurie stabs him in the chest with a knife. When Michael falls down again, Laurie turns her back on him and sits down for a rest. Um, HELLO??? This is the same killer who survived getting stabbed in the neck, REMEMBER? How about either making sure he's dead by, say, stabbing him through the eye and into the head (let's see the \\"boogeyman\\" get back up after THAT,) or just getting the hell out of there. All you people who love to point out the dumb things characters do in horror movies, you've got one of movie history's biggest Idiot Moments right here.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this film is still scary and easy enough to enjoy, all I'm saying is it's not quite perfect.ling one story to the ground?

B000BKVQTS|2.0|this movie was a waste of time to see...it lacked a plot and was confusing whether it was supposed to be funny or scary...it was just a wierd random genre.  don't be mislead by the big names like matt damon...this movie sucked...the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it was slightly funny and in that way it was entertaining.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw a few random episodes of Firefly on the Sci-Fi channel, after the series was cancelled, and was impressed.  I thought the series was pretty good.  I watched it without really having any sense of the universe or the characters, and wasn't all that in to it.  Then I saw the movie, Serenity, and loved it.  Without a doubt, the best sci-fi movie since the original Star Wars.  So I went out and bought the Firefly DVDs, and found that watching them in order is a whole different experience. <br /> <br />The characters in this series are outstanding.  They are deep, funny, and REAL in ways that almost no TV series can match.  The dialogue is witty, to the point of making me do a double-take, because that sarcastic quip didn't register right away.. it was delivered so naturally and in-character that you'd miss it if you weren't paying attention.  But if you DO pay attention, you're laughing a full 30 seconds later.  And maybe rewinding to catch it again. <br /> <br />The serious parts are equally compelling.  The action is fast, furious, and, since you care about the characters, intense.  The special-effects never give you pause--they pull you in like everything else in the series.  Dramatic scenes are somber and poignant, and carry real weight.  The fact that the seriousness is occasionally broken by humor only gives the story more momentum.  Each episode leaves me wanting more.. and that is not a common occurance. <br /> <br />
B000BKJ78U|2.0|If you prefer the \\"Special Editions\\" or if you don't care one way or the other, then this is a great package because it doesn't contain the unnecessary extra features disc and is therefore cheaper. <br /> <br />If you can't stand the \\"Special Editions\\" then don't get this.  I was very disappointed to realize that these are not the classic versions. <br /> <br />If you are offended by a discussion of why the \\"Special Editions\\" have limited appeal then stop reading now. <br /> <br />George Lucas owes everything he has to the success of one film: Star Wars (1977).  Without the success of that movie, Lucas wouldn't have been able to collaborate with Steven Spielberg on Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and outside of the Raiders and Star Wars franchises, Lucas is best known for American Graffiti and Willow.   <br /> <br />Star Wars was so far above other movies of the era that it deserves a special place in history.  It's not the best movie ever made and it certainly lacks the whiz-bang special effects that are possible today, but by the standards of the mid 70's it was like nothing else.  I'm not fanatical about the movie; I don't own a jedi robe nor can I recite every line of the script.  However, for me, and for a significant number of the fans that made the original movie a success back in the 70's, it is very hard to watch the new-and-improved version.  It's like walking into the Louvre and discovering that the Mona Lisa has been altered so that we can see her beautiful teeth.   <br /> <br />The worst part is that it is a betrayal of Lucas' most ardent fans.  The people that loved the original the most are the very same fans that hate the altered version the most... the people that made him rich now have to remain outside the gates. <br /> <br />If nothing else, the original has historical value.  Don't believe me?  Go to Blockbuster and rent a sampling of movies from 1977 and compare Star Wars to its contemporaries.  As a favor to his fans, and to history, Lucas should be release a \\"classic\\" version of Star Wars as it was in 1977. <br /> <br />The Empire Strikes Back doesn't have the same historical significance, but it is widely considered the best of the 6 films, so again, in deference to those who care, Lucas should release a \\"classic\\" version of this film too.   <br /> <br />The Return of the Jedi has no historical significance and is eschewed by most fans of the series, so I don't care one way or the other... in fact it will be a rare event for me to ever watch that silly movie again. <br /> <br />Now, we certainly have the technology to make the Mona Lisa a better portrait... but why would we want to do that?  We could make the first Super Bowl much better; we could add fans to fill the empty seats, we could make the score a lot closer, we could add Reggie White to the Packers and Tony Gonzales to the Chiefs.  We could replace Pete Roselle with a more muscular, digitized Roselle with the voice of John Facenda and give him new lines - have him name the Lombardi Trophy right there.  Imagine if the NFL came out with the \\"Special Edition\\" of Super Bowl I (which, btw, wasn't called the \\"Super Bowl\\", nor was it called \\"I\\").  Now imagine that the \\"Special Edition\\" was the only version available!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The main reaction I've seen when people see this movie for the first time is confusion, at least for the first two-thirds.  If you don't get what's going on right away, keep watching and stop questioning.  Have no worries--this is an epic sci-fi blockbuster that never got the attention it deserves. <br /> <br />If you've seen the show Firefly, you know the characters.  If you haven't, part of the fun lies in learning about what motivates them, and their individual idiosyncrasies.  Humor breaks up some of the more serious scenes, but to good effect.  The dialog is solid.  Any of the particularly cheesy dialog is handled, by way of self-referential jabs.  Also, the opposition is properly fearsome, and if you stick with the movie and listen to the dialog, very realistically motivated. <br /> <br />The action scenes in Serenity are some of the best, and some of the most tightly choerographed that I've ever seen.  The fighting styles of the two main protagonists (Mal and River) are completely unique, and both are extremely engaging.  Further, the one major space combat scene is particularly engaging. <br /> <br />So.. watch this movie just past Miranda.  Then review it!
B0009MAO46|3.0|We picked this up for our 3 year old because it's the only version easily available any more which is a shame. For the privilege of paying an extra $10-15 more for this \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" you get not a single new feature that would be of interest to any kid. Even the added \\"deleted\\" scenes are just in storyboard fun - wow, that's exciting to a kid. NOT. Just like the interviews with the film-maker, actors, etc. Great for adult movie buffs but for kids, it's a real snooze. <br /> <br />So, for some adults looking to build out their collection or who have a real interest in what the guys behind the film think of their accomplishment, sure, go ahead and get it. For anyone with a young kid who likes the movie, you are probably better off searching the bargain bins for the original release or looking for it used and saving a ton of cash. There's nothing on this new version that your kids will ever miss not having.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Whenever I buy a new CD I try not to judge how I like it the first time around because I know I could be very disappointed. This newest CD took about 5 or 6 listens before I decided that overall I do like it, although I think there are some major let-downs. For example, Rob Halford's voice, much defended on the JP website as still \\"having it\\",  sounds to me a little more strained than the average rabid JP fan would admit. This was reinforced to me when I saw them perform during the AOR tour -- Rob had to grab a railing and bend forward just to hit notes that really weren't that high. The songs themselves are a little more mature than in the past (then again, these guys are well into their fifties). At first I didn't like the song \\"Revolution\\" because I thought it was a little too rap-influenced, but I read in an interview where it was about the time when people in higher power such as Enron execs will get their just dues one day, so now I think it's pretty cool. \\"Judas Is Rising\\" is just kind of obnoxious and loud, like they are trying to still \\"shock\\" people with the anti-Christ thing that Jesus' betrayor should actually be considered \\"rising\\" --  whatever, guys.  \\"Deal with the Devil\\" is kind of their Smoke on the Water, telling the story of how they have rocked on (for over 30 years) despite the odds against them during their \\"living -in -a -car-down- by-the-river-and-eating-steel-mill- fumes -for-lunch\\" days. The songs I like best on here are \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Hellrider\\" which are true rockers despite just being a little better than average as far as JP songs go. As ever, the musicianship is great, with Scott Travis double- kicking his way around in a way that makes more than a sufficient base for the killer guitar work that is easily Glenn and KK's best since their Pain Killer days.
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein has made a name for themselves in metal. They are one of the few metal groups who have been consistent with putting out stellar albums since their debut, HERZELEID. Rammstein first got together in the early 90s, and word is that due to this formation, their wives and girlfriends left them and this inspired the creation of this massive metal monster. Rammstein employ the use of massive, crunchy guitars, pummeling rhythms, crisp keyboard flourishes, and the most threatening vocalist in Till Lindemann. The way he rolls his 'r's and sings his German phrases should give you reason enough to shiver. Guitarists Richard Kruspe and Paul Landers slice monstrous riffs through the pulsing rhythm section of bassist Oliver Riedel and drummer Christoph Schneider, all the while keyboardist Doktor \\"Christian\\" Lorenz provides bleeps and blips to flourish these metal nuggets. It all comes together to make one hell of a debut album.    \\"Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen\\" (\\"Do You Want To See The Bed In Flames\\") kickstarts the album off with a sinister keyboard intro before bursting into a full-on wall-of-guitars and crushing rhythms, while Lindemann threatens his prey. \\"Der Meister\\" (\\"The Master\\") continues the onslaught, with an apocalyptic vision, and \\"Weisses Fleisch\\" (\\"White Flesh\\") hits you head on with its shards of metal guitar and pounding drums, and accounts a dark tale of sex. \\"Seamann\\" (\\"Sailor\\") briefly escapes the metal crunch, but its lulling intro and verses are offset by an explosive and anthemic chorus. Lindemann really proves himself well on all these tracks, and he's a definite first-rate metal singer.     Other tracks that hit hard include the groove-oriented crunch of \\"Du Reichst So Gut\\" (\\"You Smell So Good\\"); the slow stomp of the massive \\"Das Alte Leid\\" (\\"The Old Pain\\"); the dark tale of yearning to marry a dead corpse in \\"Heirate Mich\\" (\\"Marry Me\\"); and, of course, \\"Rammstein\\", which was featured on the sinister Lost Highway soundtrack, and really exposed Rammstein to an audience (the video for this track will blow your mind). The title track, (translation \\"Heartache\\"), also blends hard-hitting guitars with pleading but impassioned vocals. Rammstein truly make a headbanger's dream come true all over this debut.    So while subsequent releases like SEHNSUCHT brought them further exposure, Rammstein have always proven themselves to be excellent musicians and, along with their insane live shows (yes, Lindemann really sets himself on fire and it's completely crazy!), they prove to be very entertaining in more ways than one. If you're a fan of harder rock, I highly recommend that you immerse yourself in the top-notch metallic monster that HERZELEID breathes life into...and you'll be banging your head to this pulverizing collection.

If I had to do it again and I only wanted to buy one album, I probably would have purchased a \\"greatest hits\\" type of album.
B000063Y8F|3.0|I gave up on garlic presses years ago. I could never find one that combines the features I want: durability, ease of use, and ease of cleaning. After reading all these reviews, I decided to test the theory that you get what you pay for; I ordered the Rosle Garlic Press for Christmas.  <br /> <br />It definitely looks cool and seems to be made of sturdy components. Unfortunately, it made an ugly snapping noise on the very first clove I crushed with it. One of the rivits that connects the two handles had broken and the cage that holds the garlic became badly twisted in the process.  <br /> <br />What a shock! No doubt this was due to a manufacturing defect. However, one thing that is unusual about the Rosle is that its strong, cool looking stainless steel handles do not meet when the press is closed. Could this cause excessive stress on the connecting rivits?  <br /> <br />Amazon's excellent customer service sent a replacement unit immediately. It is working well and we are satisfied with it, but our experience leads us to be very careful when operating it. We don't want this one to fail,  transforming into a shiny but expensive and useless metal sculpture!  <br /> <br />If and when we ever need to replace it, we will think carefully about spending so much on a garlic press that appears only to look more durable than its less stylish -- and less costly -- competition.
B0000CAXID|5.0|On October 17, 1994, Dave Grohl headed to a Seattle studio with the intent of recording just another demo tape.    This was something he had been in the habit of doing for the past 4 years as a way to kill time when he was on break from his \\"other\\" band, NIRVANA.  The only difference was, this time for Grohl, the break was permanent.    NIRVANA's magical reign on top of the rock and music world had abruptly ended with the death of Kurt Cobain, the band's frontman, earlier that year.  For months, Grohl had been devastated, unable to bring himself to think about music again.    But now, here he was.  With his old friend and long time personal producer Barrett Jones by his side, he returned to Robert Lang's Studios, where NIRVANA's final recording session had taken place that January.  For the next 6 days, Grohl and Jones, with (a little) help from Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, recorded approximately 15 songs that Grohl had been working on while he had been a member of NIRVANA.  A demo tape of this work then was circulated amongst Grohl's friends and peers within the industry.    The buzz was off-the-charts.      Everyone that heard the tape begged Grohl for more, and were shocked to find out he had been doing this for years on his own.  Suddenly, the guy who had been \\"lucky enough to not be the next drummer replaced by Kurt\\" had people yelling at him to start his own band.    After some time, Grohl obliged, and to appease the hype, decided that by January of 1995, he would release twelve songs off the demo tape as the self-titled release of his not-yet-existent-band, the Foo Fighters, and then rushed off to recruit bandmates before that.  But that is another story.  The album/demotape itself?    Hands-down, this is the best Foo Fighters album ever released.      While some may argue it lacks the emotion and personal feel of the band's sophomore release, I respond that this release was spurred on by death (as opposed to separation/divorce in the other album's case) and consequentially has more raw feeling to it than anything that would ever follow.  It was also the result of four years of tinkering, refining, and creative development by one person, which makes it much more focused (as opposed to two years of work and 3-4 other people in the 2nd album's case, making it much less focused).    This is a very cryptic, lyrically abstract album, a popular trend by the standards of 1994 but a dying technique in today's mainstream music as the average music listener is sadly becoming dumber and dumber.  As a result artists need to dumb their lyrical content down to connect with their audience.  Fortunately, Grohl has penned a guide to his songs' lyrical content, and that was of great assistance in this review.  However, it is quite obvious in the guide that he is purposely silent on some songs because for years, this album has been rightfully been rumored to be about Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.    The album starts off with a soft melody, that quickly jumps into a fast-paced, feel-good NIRVANA-esque song entitled \\"This Is A Call.\\"  Grohl pounds the drums with joy, but pounds the guitar and bass with equal aggression.  According to Dave, this song is a \\"shout-out\\" to everyone he ever knew, and is somewhat of a \\"thank you.\\"  The only issue I have is towards the end, where a melody appears that bears an inverted resemblance to the main riff of NIRVANA's \\"Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter.\\"    With only a millisecond of recovery time after the first song ends, we immediately are hit with a furious attack of drums, and a \\"very negative song about violation/deprivation,\\" also known as \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" kicks off, which ends on a very climactic, repetitive, yet strongly effective note.  We are introduced to Grohl's anger for the first time, and to this day it is rumored that this song was written about Courtney Love, whom he felt had abused his friend Kurt when he was alive and even now when he was dead, and also about how he would prove himself to be better than her in the end.  Oh, how right he was...    The aggression tones down with \\"Big Me,\\" arguably the most popular song off this album.  It's a sweet, sappy love song about trying to work out issues in a relationship, and most people will remember it for the Mentos allusion in the video.  The guitar work is what it needs to be, and Dave's multi-layered vocals are excellent, but his drumming on this track tends to sound too strong and out of place.  Love songs like these tend to sound more suitable with William Goldsmith and later Taylor Hawkins on the drums.    \\"Alone + Easy Target\\" is a song that Grohl had actually practiced instrumentally with NIRVANA in 1991 during soundchecks before shows, and the NIRVANA-esque feel is there again.  This could be a song written about constantly having to prove himself to Cobain but then watching him do the same with his wife.  This theme seems to continue in \\"Good Grief,\\" which talks about \\"the thought of being ousted,\\" a probable reference to Cobain's reportedly maddening control-freak nature.    \\"Floaty\\" is the only song Grohl claims has ever had effects used on his voice, due to his \\"amazing insecurity about it,\\" but it really makes the song shine.  The title, lyrics, and the feel of the song all seem to scream out \\"spacy.\\"  It is absolutely unclear what the song could be about.  In my opinion, this is the most \\"relaxing shoutfest\\" I've ever heard, particularly during the chorus.    \\"Weenie Beenie\\" may be the most pointless song on the album, but we have to keep in mind that this was a demo tape, and Grohl was a former member of NIRVANA, a Sonic-Youth-inspired band with a penchant for experimentation.  On this track, Grohl uses an interesting technique of muffling his voice nearly-completely so that the lyrics are unintelligible (fans have since deciphered the words to this song) and putting a very, VERY grungy riff for the verse and the chorus.  The song is really funny to listen to the first time, but its repeat value is very low.    Grohl claims that \\"Oh, George\\" is also pointless.  Perhaps he feels so because of its sound being something like a cross between \\"Big Me\\" and \\"Exhausted,\\" another song on the album, but it's a very reflective song which is my favorite vocal performance by Dave on the entire album.  The lyrics seem to about leaving the music world on \\"the train\\" and then coming back after having \\"waited for his turn.\\"    This is followed by \\"For All The Cows,\\" yet another triumphant bash to Courtney Love and other \\"cash cows.\\"  It makes a mockery out of their desire to advance in society and become \\"upper class,\\" when at the same time they cannot forfeit their despicable habits more synonymous with less \\"rich\\" people.  It follows the soft-loud formula of \\"This Is A Call,\\" but also features some longer playful strumming in the verse by Grohl, while the chorus goes all-out in aggression, and we finally get an excellent solo that rocks up the verse melody.    Greg Dulli drops by for \\"X-Static,\\" and we are treated to a grungy, brooding session of melancholy by Grohl, who says songs like this are \\"the only way he can express grief or happiness.\\"  The meaning of the apparently defeatist lyrics is strongly unclear.  A depressing musical landscape is painted by Grohl.  Although this song does not have a fast drumming part, Grohl seems to relish the relief provided by Dulli and bangs the drums with intense fervor for a slower song such as this.    Dave then turns his attention to record industry politics with \\"Wattershed,\\" and attacks how labels trap idealistic punk bands with their clauses and tricks in contracts, which essentially leads to the bands selling their souls.  The song is as aggressive as \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" which shows how passionate Grohl is about his love for punk and how it is painful to see it in this state.    The album concludes with \\"Exhausted,\\" a song that is very sad and is primarily instrumental, but features another excellent vocal performance by Grohl.  The meaning of the lyrics are unclear.  There is a long feedback section of the song, which features intermittent drumming by Grohl at the same time, and creates a similar feel to the \\"relaxing rockfest\\" vibe that \\"Floaty\\" gave off, except in this case it's much more depressing.    Is this album perfect?  Of course not.  It's very raw, unpolished, and sounds like...well, a demo tape.  But despite all of its flaws, it is 99% a compendium of one man's years of private work, and it is sometimes soft, sometimes loud, sometimes angry, sometimes happy, and sometimes depressing.  The best part is that thanks to the abstract lyrics, the listener can make the album be about basically whatever he or she wants it to be and thanks to the emotional range, is suitable for any sort of mood.  Although some of the lyrics may be more obvious than others, this is the true gift of the record and why even today, it towers over anything else Grohl has done since.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|Legendary music gets its first release...blah blah, you know the hype, and this is certainly particularly exciting coming as it does just after the Monk/ Coltrane at Carnegie Hall release. First, I don't think it's as good as the 'A Love Supreme' deluxe edition, which was frankly astounding, and it's not the Holy Grail either. The packaging and liner notes (with contributions from Ashley Khan and Ravi Coltrane) are all immaculate and beautifully designed, just as they were for the 'ALS' deluxe.  <br /> <br />However, there is one major drawback: as these were radio broadcasts with the restricted time limit of 45 minutes, both discs manage to incorporate only one complete and one incomplete piece each.  So, just a few minutes after Coltrane has soared back into 'Afro-Blue' and 'My  Favorite Things' after ferociously powerful McCoy Tyner solos, he is cut off by the radio DJ bidding us goodnight. I've always found that the greatest parts of Coltrane's soprano explorations are after Tyner has had his say and Trane comes back in to really hit the stratosphere- then come back down in a beautiful, graceful shower of notes.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, there are many positives (how could there not be?), not least Elvin Jones' massive drumming and Tyner, reaching into the heart of his soul with his churning, powerful, graceful, passionate, epic solos. And Coltrane himself, driving forward like an unstoppable force of nature; Jones comments that it was like he was \\"sitting on a mountain of ideas, and they would flake off every three of four seconds.\\"   <br /> <br />This is particularly apparent in the heart of the collection, 'One Down, One Up,' a 27-minute work comparable to 'Chasin' the Trane', but even more extreme. Jimmy Garrison's bass solo opens the track (in fact, DJ Alan Grant later informs us that the piece had been going on for 35 minutes before the broadcast started- that's 62 minutes in total!), before Trane comes in with the dark modal theme  on sax with Tyner'scrashing left hand chords behind him...and then goes! 20 minutes in and he's lost none of his energy, frantically spilling out ideas over Jones' drums in a frenzied duet. At times, his tone approximates that of an electric instrument; sometimes he finds a phrase and repeats it for a few seconds, but then he's off again into yet more territory uncharted by music before or since... <br /> <br />There's hardly a moment of repose in the whole set, apart from the graceful openings of 'Afro-Blue' and 'MFT', and the beautiful ballad 'Song of Praise' (which soon turns into another full-blown workout, however).  If there is such a thing as 'cosmic music', then this is it. So, despite the flaws in sound quality (there are several noticeable dropouts on the title track) and completness, this is yet another must-own masterpiece for the Coltrane completist. <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I love this soundtrack and everytime I listen to it, I'm instantly brought back to Brokeback Mountain. I am usually not too big of a fan of country music, but this this particular score is very soft and easy on the ears. I love the songs as well, especially \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Devil's Right Hand\\". I'm disappointed the score didn't win a Golden Globe. It definitely deserves a good listening. It's very soothing and I can't stop listening to it. I think this and the Walk the Line soundtrack are two of the best ones to be released in 2005.It's really beautiful and matches the sweeping landscapes of BBM.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is not necessarily a review of album.It is really the end of this crap put out by metalheads and people who arent over 1990's. aka including socialist metalhead. Face it Soundgarden and Rage against Machine were great bands. Patricularly, Rage was not just a innovative musical movement but of social change as well. Even alternative stuff like Battle OF LA was great. And yes, Soundgarden was great band too. I do prefer Badmoterfinger over Superunknown are both great albums and are considered masterpieces by todays standards of music. Thir earlier stuff and Down on the Upside is good too. Audioslave is not a great band but they are far from bad. Chris Cornell is good singer. He doesnt have greatest voice but easily beats todays crop...cough cough nickelback, good charlotte, emo, well basically any numetal band that has come along in the last 6-7 years. Anyway, the album is number of goods particularly in the first half like show me how to live, gasoline, and like a stone. The last half somewhat trails off but a solid offering from Rage + lead singer of soundgarden. 4 stars is the rating. <br />By the way, i know im going to be blasted for writing this review.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|Especially in the first hour or so I felt like I instead got the wrong DVD and was watching a drama that was seriously boring, for I do find most dramas boring. The lead actress whines and whines throughout this movie and it really got annoying, not to mention that the storyline never became too good and the ending was so typical. The whole movie was pretty typical and never was I jolted out of my seat or even surprised for one moment. This movie was dull- possibly because the storyline I feel is very familiar to other films I have seen- which it is.  <br />The acting itself is not too strong and the whole movie feels just like a combination of a bunch of other films I have seen. The whole story is boring and not bold at all or fresh in idea. I very much disliked this film and I highly recommend another horror film. This movie is just not worth watching to me. My friends only thought it was okay and it was just that- average and nothing special. Try looking for another horror movie first before trying this one is my best advice.

B0006A9FKA|1.0|After all the great reviews, I decided to buy this movie.  Well, it was a big fat waste of ten bucks. If you've seen the preview of this movie, then you've seen all of the best parts in the entire thing.  It's not funny.  It really is not funny.  And all of the characters are completely stupid.  About three quarters of the movie I turned it off.  Just watch the preview, and you'll have seen all of the good parts.
0684824906|5.0|To my knowledge (and I admit that I may be wrong), this is the first biography of Lincoln to focus almost exclusively on his extremely astute political mastery and manipulation. The fact that he was willing to assemble his cabinet from some of his rivals for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination alone shows that he was a man quite sure of his vision, and of where he wanted to take the country. He used the cabinet as his sounding board, and often deferred to their collecrtive advice even when it contradicted his own inclinations. This is a side of Lincoln most histories don't cover, and I found it fascinating. In additon, the book was written in a quite lucid style, and never got bogged down with minutia. Although there is a running report of the ongoing Civil War, the battles are not recounted in any detail, which would only have increased the length of the book, without adding anything of substance to it. For Lincoln appreciators, this book is a must read, for a decidedly different view of the Great Emancipator!
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Ann weeps buckets for poor Kong, while dozens die trying to save her; blondes in New York who aren't Ann are callously tossed aside in a manner that makes you laugh, except it isn't funny; the bones of his previous \\"brides\\" indicate they were ripped limb-from-limb.  But, you know, poor Kong.  <br /> <br />The \\"ick\\" factor was remarkably high, especially the bugs and the pink snake things. <br /> <br />And pretty much every scene was too long.  EVERYTHING seemed to go on and on and on.  And they spent so much time with the minor characters that you cared about them and that made it harder as they kept on getting knocked off. <br /> <br />I thought the cgi was good and realistic (there is such a variance it's amazing to me...the Hulk never looked real for one minute, Kong looks good).  And the acting was pretty good, including Jack Black (after all the character is meant to be broad).  <br /> <br />The trouble with everything taking so long is that you start to lose that essential suspension of belief.  Early on I'm thinking that ship is too small to take Kong back to NY.  The ship takes quite a pounding on the rocks, but then all is well without going to a drydock.  How do the villagers live exactly on all that bare rock?  The ape moves in true ape fashion (on all fours) but then is carrying Ann in its front feet and she doesn't get mashed to a pulp?  How come Ann doesn't get hypothermia (not to mention goose-bumps) being out in all that cold weather in her sleeveless dress for a long damn time, not to mention the wind at the top of the Empire State Building.  I know I'm nit-picking, but a movie has to have some logic (or at least live within the boundaries of its own particular story logic).   <br /> <br />Sorry, I think Peter Jackson is capable of better.  Oh and by the way, do the women in his life have no influence?  Stop making movies so damn long with no intermission, ie: bathroom break!
B00005JOFO|5.0|A new standard is set not a gay-themed film, but a film about two people who TRUELY love each other so much, that one love is part of the other and they cannot separate... Unfortunately because of the the time period 1962 and country they live they must live separate lives.         One in a million is an individual fortunate to find real love for another. A beautiful film because this is a masterpiece of cinematography and one forgets it is 1962; but timeless with bucolic scences, mountains, sheep and with a score which adds a great deal of the emotional underlining of the pair of Ennis and Jack. Love of these two for each other is transformational that their logic and commonsense for time and space are forgotten for the love of the other. This is the best love story I have ever seen. A film about a \\"love that will never grow old\\"; about life unfulilled and separation,secrets and finally totemism of smells of clothes of the beloved, rememberence and and finally deep loneliness of remembered brief moments of true Lover's happiness. Cries of deep emotion like \\"surgical cutting\\" of the beloved and never to find that true love again. Most humans need someone to love and they find an unauthentic love.      We are always searching for that one true inseparable love but we never find it. Some give up and just \\"have a marriage without love\\", they think they are in true love, but it is not a deep enduring love. Some just give up into past love and what could have been, or fantasy love. I had a deeply felt emotional connection with this film directed by the genius of director Ang Lee. I will never forget this film; it is part of me and my loveless life fovever brokeback. [...]

B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a new standard for film not being a gay film but about two people,two human beings,who find one true love only and no other.Two people who love each other so much one is a part of the other. Even though they must marry and settle down with kids and wives, they still feel a part of the other. It will never leave them. Though they only meet once a month or less still their love is all they have. It is a transformational story about love,rememberence and finally a totem of a shirt and jacket of the beloved which must be felt and smelled so that the one you love is still a part of you. It is about loneliness of memories of wonderful good-byes with a smile looking back waiting for the next meeting (a beautiful ending of the film). Until finally...  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  The cinematogaphy is a masterpiece of bucolic landscapes and <br /> a beautiful scorce which adds a great deal of the emotional underlining of the two Ennis and Jack. A masterpiece of direction by Ang Lee who through his art \\"paints a portrait of a love that will not die\\", a love who is a part of you and cannot live without even if all you have are beautiful and sad memories and a shirt and jacket.I don't care if this film wins an oscar or two-- it is a new standard in film making when it does not mater who you love just truely love them. It will remain a great film one of the top 100 films ever made. It remains a part of my life.

I didn't even look at the page numbers, I just kept reading completely lost in this world.  I read Shade's Children by Nix which was incredible, so I figured I would read this one... Wow, no other way to put it, just so intensely wow.  I connected completely with Sabriel, I felt her emotions I saw what she saw, I felt what she felt.

0307276902|2.0|I started reading this book before the revelation that Mr Frey \\"embellished\\" (aka LIED) throughout his \\"memoir\\" and while I agree that the story is well-written, Mr Frey has lost all of his credibility. After the first 10 pages or so, \\"Million Little Pieces\\" reads like the script for a \\"Lifetime\\" or \\"Oxygen\\" channel movie. Mr Frey's \\"I'm a Victim\\" shtick may play well on Oprah, but the sympathy factor is running pretty low elsewhere. The characters he meets in rehab, whether real or fictional, give us no reason to care about them.  Note to Mr Frey: Grow up and get a life.

0393327655|2.0|Sam Harris' book is mostly shrill polemics.  I am somewhat disappointed.  Although I disagree with atheism on many grounds, I like a good book to challenge my position or at least, written in an engaging, yet, philosophically honest way.  Harris' book is engaging, yet it is wrought with many logical problems.  By now, I imagine many people who are against religion are hitting their no votes (maybe I'll be surprised and they'll hit \\"yes\\"), but honest and rigorous dialogue is much better for all world views.  I found this book to be the other side of the coin of the very idea he at times seem to attack.<br /><br />There are so many problems that a small review cannot cover it all, so I'll just show a couple of examples. His assertion that \\"Religious moderation is a product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance\\" is truly a lack of understanding of religious history.  There has always been \\"religious moderates\\" and I'm not sure exactly how to classify a religious moderate.  He spends so much time attacking religious moderates, that a clear definitions escapes or at the very least, is shallow.  He claims religious moderation is because of two thousands years of knowledge and many of the things he sights, can be in part  the result of religious inquiry (after all, concern for human rights was a Christian idea  that revolutionized the Roman world).<br /><br />Also he preaches the virtues of science to be able to answer spiritual and ethical questions.  This I think is an intriguing, yet, faulting position.  One of the strongest arguments against \\"Creation Science\\" is that often, they confuse \\"How\\" a mechanism works, by always asking \\"Why.\\"  Science is an interpretation of data, both forensic and observable.  Applying scientific discoveries to answer ethical and spiritual questions goes beyond science to metaphysics.  I would hope Harris would know this since he has a degree in Philosophy.  Maybe he should read Shelly's \\"Frankenstein.\\"<br /><br />He holds reason and condemns faith, but misunderstands both.  Many have come to faith (of all world views) through reason, while others have accepted (again, it involves all world views) out of \\"unjustified belief.\\"  There have been philosophers, scientists, and artists who were both atheists and theists (and others in-between) coming to those conclusions, they would assert, using reason.<br /><br />His ability as a translator of, or understanding of, the philogy of words is absolutely neglected.  He neither understands the history of the Hebrew translations of Isaiah 7:14 nor the Greek Septuagint and its history.  He also makes convenient arguments if something goes against his presentation.  For example, he call Stalin's and Mao's communism a \\"political religion\\" and blames the results of Hitler's Nazism on Christian anti-Semitism while conveniently neglecting to inform the reader that liberal Christianity had taken hold of Germany in the mid to late 1800's, resulting in a state that more atheistic than theistic and conservative Christian like Bonhoeffer opposed anti-Semitism and Nazism.  Also, Hitler was greatly influence by Nietzsche, himself an atheists (although, Hitler would pervert Nietzsche teachings as well).<br /><br />This book is riddled with Straw Men, Absolute Negatives, and faulty premises (he argues against things miracles without arguing against miracles is one example).<br /><br />Lastly, however, he does call people to be critical, and while he gives secular ideas a pass most often (but not always), many people involved in religious traditions need to apply sound reasoning principles.  If one is looking for rigouros books supporting atheism, try Smith's \\"Case Against God\\" or Johnson's \\"Atheist's Debater Handbook\\", while I'm a Theists, these books are musc better prepared and argued.t misunderstands both.

0425173895|5.0|It'd be difficult to review this book without the temptation to spoil the plot, but I'll do my best not to. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd must be one of Agatha Christie's most stunning pieces of work. Like many of her Hercule Poirot's mysteries, this book is written from a first-person angle. Only, this time, it isn't Hastings with the pen.<br /><br />In a small village, the narrator, a doctor, joins forces with the already retired Poirot to solve the murder of a wealthy man.  A prior death, an odd friendship and a blackmailer are just some of the issues that Poirot have to piece together that eventually leads to a stunning conclusion.<br /><br />While many have branded Christie as cheating for the way this book was written, there's no doubt that the facts were indeed laid out clearly for the readers. Perhaps the plot twist is just a little to shocking to bear, but this doesn't stop this book for being totally enjoyable. A legend of a detective story, this is, and one that you must read if you're a fan of whodunnit.

0553804367|3.0|No need to leave this lying around on the coffee table to impress your guests, like many did with the first book: you should actually read Stephen Hawking's new book because you will learn quite a lot from it.<br /><br />He keeps his promise to strip things down to the essentials, though some may argue that he goes too far in that regard.  In the part where Edwin Hubble discovers how to measure the distance to other galaxies, proving that they are in fact separate, distant galaxies, Hawking does not get into the details of how Hubble used the discovery of variable Cepheid stars to accomplish this.  And in the part where he talks about paired particles and their curious interaction with black holes, he perhaps modestly does not identify the name of this phenomenon: Hawking radiation.<br /><br />This is a good three-evening read for most educated laymen. A science popularizer like Timothy Ferris actually writes meatier books than this.  But there is a certain undeniable appeal to having this greatest living cosmologist (so we're told by those who know) spell things out for us personally.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|Call me old-fashioned, but a good story needs three components:  a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Leave out any one of the three, and the recipient of the story--even though he or she may be impressed by the authenticity, grit, and determination of the components portrayed--walks away from the experience with feelings of ho-hum indifference, at best.<br /><br />Such is the case with director Sam Mendes' JARHEAD (\\"High and tight, Soldier, high and tight!\\").  This movie depicting a Marine Corps unit's adventures during the 1991 Gulf War has a solid beginning, when we are introduced to several characters as they crawl and grunt through basic training before deployment to Arabia; and it has a middle, the subsequent \\"waiting game\\" the soldiers must endure prior to conflict--waiting that entails boredom, hydration, fighting amongst themselves, hydration, lamenting when their wives or girlfriends in the States dump them, hydration, going desert bonkers, and more hydration.  And then. . .nothing.  The unit marches through a barren wasteland, punctuated by burning oil wells belching hellfire into the sky, yet never encounters an enemy to engage.  Before a shot can be fired, the war is over; the unit gets shipped back home.<br /><br />There's no ending.  Granted, there is an \\"ending,\\" but nothing to make us wonder, understand, or even give a darn why we were subjected to the antics of this bunch of soldiers--other than an underhanded agenda to gig the Marine Corps (duly noted by the narrating character).<br /><br />JARHEAD is a well-made, very visual, often intense film.  Lead character Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a gritty, sometimes over-the-top performance, and he's complimented very aptly by Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, and several other young actors.  Jamie Foxx gets tapped on the shoulder to portray the stereotypical staff sergeant who yells and barks and admonishes and punishes and so on.  Mendes shows us the dirt, grime, sweat, comedy, drama, fear, insecurity, and immaturity of a group of males little more than boys out in the desert, augmented by an absolutely fantastic musical score; but he doesn't give the viewer an ending to match the story so diligently put in place.  It's dry.  I'll have a bottled water.<br /><br />--D.

The original film brilliantly alternated between dreamlike and nightmarish meditations on the nature of war, but I always wanted to see the epic breadth and depth this story deserved. For our sins, Coppola finally gave it to us, and we should thank him.
B00004W52U|5.0|In my mind there are three things that go in to making good punk music; originality, energy, and lyrics. This band perfects all three. In terms of having an original sound, they took ska-punk to a whole new level, with a unique metallic distortion, and raw lead vocals by Jesse Michaels. In my opinion, the best kind of energy in punk is fast and fun, and listening to this music, i almost cry in sadness that i wasn't able to skank and mosh to it at one of their legendary concerts in the late 80s. As for lyrics, well the LP usually comes with an insert containing all the lyrics, and they are simply genius. Some punk bands have political lyrics that are just dry and boring, but their passion for music in general comes through in brilliant comments on most social and political issues of their, and our time. You can definitely tell by any song on this album that they had more fun playing it then anyone ever did listening to it, and with this band that's saying something huge. This is the only album out there that makes me want to organize a political or social movement now, and have fun doing it. And if all you wanna do in life is sit around with friends listening to good music, its good for that to.
0802130208|2.0|Well, after reading a host of rave reviews I decided to give this book a whirl.  Supposedly a comedy, I cannot recall laughing once during it, and with a wholly predictable story it failed to delilver.  The only saving grace is a good ending, but the build up to it was oh so dreary.
B000089RVX|5.0|I got this CD when it was new in 2003.  I've been addicted to Amy Lee's music ever since.  I also have their follow-up album \\"Anywhere but Home\\" and eagerly await their next release, which should be in March 2006.  If the music were clothes, I'd have worn them out by now :-D
B0007GAERG|5.0|Five Huge Stars!! Mariah just gets better and better and the voice is AMAZING. Forget the personal stuff, to me she's \\"The Singer\\". Casting off her influences long ago (like Whitney, for example, and the late octave jumper Minnie Riperton) she has created her own personal sound and her own corner of the music world. Her longevity has made her into one of the TOP SELLING singers in all of recorded music history and that can never be denied. She's successful because she hangs in and deals from the heart with a rangy voice that is PURE MAGIC. Snoop, Jermaine, Nelly and Twista pump up the volume on four great collaborations. This fabulous CD brought home 3 Grammys in 2006 in the R&B category.      I like to put this CD on and let it cycle from \\"It's Like That\\" to \\"One and Only\\",  but I keep breaking the cycle and going back to Grammy-winning song \\"We Belong Together\\", the  'Piece D'Resistance', over and over. Also, I love \\"Mine Again\\": a soaring, beautiful ballad that is destined to be a favorite of  'Quiet Storm' format radio shows across the nation. \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" are likewise excellent. Mariah is the Real Deal and Elvis would be proud to share the #1's record with her. We love you, Mimi. Five Tuneful Stars!!  (This review is based on an ITunes Music Store download of the CD).
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've been their die-hard fan for 9 years (since Ultra) and know/have *all* their b-sides & albums. But I can safely say that Playing the angel is one of their best ever! Isn't it great to see your favourite band release yet-another TOP album, after *26* years of existence? Many of todays bands vanish after 4-5 or so years... DM proved again that they are the true godfathers of electro-music. This album is hard, groovy, melancholic, it's dramatic and dirty - it's DM! Many of the songs are growers or have some hidden surprise element, which is great, as you will have to take some time to truly enjoy the songs. There are no fillers here! Some don't like Martin songs, but I find them as a true avantgarde and masterpieces in their own way. <br /> <br />I will, however, take one song as an example of pure DM genius: Sinner in me. That song is nasty, but the last 1:30 minutes are just insane!! <br /> <br />Playing the angel is their second peak after Violator and no one, absolutely no one thought that was possible after all these years and departure of Alan! Bravo!!
B000286RNY|5.0|I caught this one on cable just a few nights ago and I have to admit I laughed my you know what off.  I think my teenaged son laughed harder than I did.  This is like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Meets the Mighty Ducks.  A former soccer great called Golden Leg Funghad his career ruined after a gangster caused him to break his legendary leg.  years later, Fung meets a Kung Fu Master named Sing whose steel leg can do wonders on a soccer ball.  Sing is a Bruce Lee look-alike and even wears the yellow jump suit that Lee wore in Game of Death.  Fung reunites Sing with his former Shaolin brothers and puts their remarkable Kung Fu skills to work on the soccer field.  The brothers all have names which are clues to their Kung Fu Skills such as Iron Head, Lighting Hands, Iron Shirt Tin, and hooking leg.<br /><br />Together they form one outrageous teams complimented by Matrix like special effects as  balls are kicked and scream like rockets, trailing fire and tearing up the field as they fly towards the opponents goal.  Or Hooking Leg demonstrates the most incredible degree of hook ever seen as his kicks turn 90 degrees.  Fung sets them up for a run in a bis soccer tournament and a show down with the team of the mob leader who caused his injury years earlier.  His team is called the dastardly \\"Team Evil\\" just in case their black uniforms and scowls didn't tip you off.<br /><br />The formula works like any of those American films such as Mighty Ducks, Bad News Bears or the like.  Shaolin Soccer is like watching a live action cartoon with the wild, slap-stick action and special effects.  The cast is hilarious with brilliant one-liners and facial expressions.  The film is dubbed in English.  Star Steven Chow directed the film and Chow also directed the highly successful Kung Fu Hustle that came out in 2005.
076790382X|3.0|First I have to mention that I am not a U.S. Citizen, and I did read the German version of Bill Bryson's book. <br />After six years of living in the U.S. it's easy reading, and depending what subject you're on, it can be fun. <br />A lot of topics are covered by a view that I doubt can be shared by many, because the \\"facts\\" stated seem to be valid for \\"his little American corner of the country\\" only. <br />Though he often makes jokes about himself, he at the same time  manages to sound superior over the \\"average American\\". <br />You do tend to wonder quite often why he didn't move back to England, if most things here are so horribly wrong and ridiculous. <br />A tendency to spread political views (left) gives the a last bitter taste to this book. <br />It's good writing, just don't put too much thought into what's being written, or you won't enjoy it.
0446677450|1.0|What a waste of time. This book is suggested by Quixstar/Amway types, need I say more. Kiosaki does not give any relevant information at all. This book will be viewed as great by people that mindlessly go about reading and are not too astute on business and the economy. His one sentence advice (buy low sell high type stuff) is thoughtless and he seems like a shady type.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Horrible film, full of cheap shots and horrible special FX.  I rented it and wish I had saved the four dollars.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother even reading the synopsis on the back, you may get lured in by the pretty packaging and wind up cursing the names of the director, actors and producers far into the night and maybe even the next day.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At times this feels more like a classic film than a TV series.  The characters are wonderful, the score is really too good for TV in some spots, and there are moments when you feel like you're in something that should be winning Oscars.  The attention to detail on character development, as well as the great dialogue have earned 'Firefly' its deserved place as a top seller.    <br />   This well-acted, well-written series is almost as good as the current hit \\"Lost,\\" (it's certainly funnier and more endearing) and could be as successful if only someone would get with the program and renew it.  Thankfully, the fans have spoken and are continuing to spread the word, lending out their DVD sets and buying more as gifts.  Don't judge this one as a Sci Fi, but a story about people that you will come to love.  It touches almost everyone and is sure to make a fan out of you. <br /> <br />Be sure to pick up the Firefly Box set (you will probably watch it all in one sitting - most people are hooked after the first 2 episodes or so) and then view Serenity for an even *more* exciting, action packed story that will have you laughing and crying all over again. <br />  It's just possible that millions of intelligent fans can undo Fox's idiocy and get this show back on the air *somewhere.*    It happened for Family Guy, which is nowhere near the quality of Firefly.      <br />     <br />   No kidding, this is one of the best shows you'll ever have the privilege to see.   A month ago, I had never seen a single episode, and now it is my favorite TV series ever.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br />This video first came to my attention when someone on NPR provided an analysis of the movie comparing it to the Reagan Presidency.  That alone should show that there are multiple possible interpretations for this movie.  Of course, the 900 plus reviews on Amazon might be another clue as well. <br /> <br />As you watch the movie, several possibilities come to mind.  Donnie Darko is insane.  Donnie Darko is going to somehow save the world.  Donnie Darko's friends are pulling the most elaborate practical joke on him and this is facilitated by the psychotropic drugs that are proscribed for him. In the end, all of these are wrong.  <br /> <br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" is about self-determination. On one hand, it offers hope that we do have control over our destinies and we are not just machines that God has set in motion to follow His plan. One the other hand, it offers the idea that by choosing his own immolation, Donnie will have made the world a better place. <br /> <br />Of course, Donnie did this because he believes it will save the life of his girlfriend.  In the end, even that is unknowable.  Does she simply die at the hands of her estranged father vice being run over?  Do enough of the memories from the alternate future remain to discredit the child molester/motivational speaker that Donnie unmasks?  In the end, this movie is disturbing in that it not only has characters that are extremely likable yet bizarrely antisocial but its lack of answers on really any issues other than the possibility of time travel and free choice. <br /> <br />Many of the reviewers have painted this as an anti-\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  Frank the giant rabbit is organizing and directing Donnie's life.  Frank Capra the director and Frank the giant rabbit.  Yet, in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" it was possible to know the result of one's choices.  In \\"Donnie Darko\\", one does not even know if choice is a possibility until the very end. The final results of thosechoices remain unfathomable.   <br /> <br />This is an excellent story and needs to be watched at least twice to get all the subtle points.  For example, who is the overweight Asian girl and why does she have a crush on Donnie?  While the main story comes together at the end with a revealing series of scenes, it is far better than a \\"gimmick\\" movie that is of no interest once the viewer learns the \\"real\\" secret. <br />
B00004SCX6|4.0|Of the 4 studio albums she's made to date, I think this is the \\"worst\\" studio-album made, although i love it, as a britneyfan. <br /> <br /> 01.

0440241588|4.0|This reviewer is not a Grisham fan, and prefers accuracy in technological and military matters ... but this Grisham book deserves praise. <br /> <br />The positive: Above all, it is a delightful travel guide to Bologna, Italy. Reading it, one wants to visit Bologna. Also, a good thriller, a fun story, except for the few things that keep it from five stars... Some of those things are not in the \\"sin\\" category, because Grisham humbly and delightfully admits his total lack of expertise in the Author's Note at the end. And indeed, he has no idea how satellite orbits work, nor does he appreciate that the Defense Intelligence Agency is not run by a major. <br />The weak part: After the first twenty-thirty pages I was ready to throw this into the thrashbin, as I am sure other readers have been tempted. The \\"humorous\\" or \\"weird\\" approach in writing about the White House, the CIA, etc. is just sophomoric. Not that they don't deserve the implied ctritique - but the general approach is like that of Alfred P. Newman (of \\"Mad\\" magazine fame), not that of a major author... <br />But dear reader, bear with the pretty bad beginning. After that, the style recovers, and therefore the story becomes highly readable, and indeed, by the time we are in Northern Italy, very enjoyable. <br />I will refuse to use terms like a \\"good read\\", as I find that to be bad English. But it is a very enjoyable story, and leaves you with a good feeling at the end, like many Hollywood movies of the '40s and '50s. In fact, this would make a great movie. <br />Now, the fact that Grisham is sort of \\"anti-establishment\\" - well, I gues that sells books... <br />Buy it, read it, survive the first few dozen pages and you'll not be sorry...
B00000J2PH|5.0|If you are a child of the 60's and 70's, this is a CD for you.  King has a great voice and listening to this CD brought me back to my days as a peace loving flower child!
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman has achieved a rare feat with American Gods. It is a realistic work of fantasy fiction, which has lost none of its style in the process. In it he sets out to tell a story about the Gods; so, very naturally, he writes about people; people in their mass consciousness. A war between the gods is taking places. It is a war behind the curtain, and in the minds of the people. Ever worshipped your high speed connection? Well, think again. \\"The Fat Kid,\\" is a living, breathing god. He's there because the people have knelt down (literally in this case) and worshipped him. Just as they worship many creations of modern society, and forgotten the gods that they brought here, in their minds, when they're ancestors came to this land from their respective countries many years ago. The gods, old and new, fight in a very real and very satisfying way. That, however, would not be nearly as enthralling if it weren't for the brilliant characters and places that the author brings to the table in this book, and enriches with several subplots, and unifies in his commentary on America and their gods.<br /><br />Mr. Wednesday is the most fascinating character in the book, as a sly, aging conman, who is more then he seems. He begins his role as a mysterious stranger who hires a fresh out of jail, and freshly widowed, Shadow, as an errand boy of sorts. This results in Shadow's introductions to Mr. Wednesday's sometimes quirky, and often times horrifying associates, who all just so happen to be gods. Shadow, the main character, is a \\"static character\\" of sorts, but nonetheless enthralls the reader and manages to make them care about his outcome. A more extroverted main character unlikely would have harmonized as well with the feeling and focus of this book. This is a story about gods, so when Shadow finds himself mixed up with these characters they usually have the most to say.<br /><br />The common bond that all the characters in this story share is the land. In actuality, the land is the main character of American Gods. It is only right then that it has been fully realized. The book is America through a looking glass. As he did in Neverwhere, Gaiman shows his ability to take familiar places, and make them both wondrous and terrifying at the same time. He creates a unique, but still very familiar, America. The exciting part is that much of the action takes place in real places. Places that seem unreal, and are suitable backdrops for a mythical battle, yet you can visit nonetheless. You could go visit the world's largest Carousel, which the gods use as the portal to their meeting place, or go to the Fat Man's Squeeze, in which Shadow races through, heading to his destination, and the climatic end of the novel. If you want to know how to get to them, you need only read this book. It is a road map to such places, real, imaginary, and somewhere in between.<br /><br />Though Neil Gaiman has taken many ideas from Harlan Ellison's collection of short stories (Deathbird Stories), this book is entirely his own. He succeeds in creating his own take on Ellison's medley of stories commentating on modern gods, and intertwining it with a complex, twisting plot, that refuses to take back seat to the Gods. The changes and events that Shadow goes through after the passing of his wife, his relationship with the other characters that goes deeper then he knows, the small town murder mystery that Shadow plays a part in solving, are all as interesting as the war of the gods, and effect the outcome as well. This is Gaiman's best work to date, and it should be ranked on any list of the greatest fantasy fictions.racter of American Gods. It is only right then that it has been fully realized.

B00000J7J4|5.0|I've listened to Carlos Santana since I was a teenager (now in my 50\\"s).  He sounds as good or better than he did back in the day!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya's music progresses slowly, which in her case is a good thing.  The tracks on this CD are just as heavenly and ephemeral as those on any of her previous efforts.  It is funny with Enya- you expect that voice and those same atmospheres with every CD and in one sense you might fear that it will be \\"just more of the same\\" or even feel trite in some way; but it never is.  She stays true to form yet evolves just enough to always keep it beautiful and interesting.  This is another top notch effort from her.  I strongly recommend it.
B000002JEV|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin at it finest moments, pure raw to the bone bluesy rock n' roll live on the BBC. Very well done every track is good and sounds just as great or greater than the studio versions. You got the likes of:) <br />You Shook Me <br />I Can't Quit You Baby <br />Communication Breakdown <br />Dazed and Confused <br />Black Dog <br />Thank You <br /> heck, just take a gander, try them out yourself, you'll see what I mean, just awesome. This should be in every Zep fans collection, you'll wish you were behind the booth at the BBC, watching them pour it out, LIVE!
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Again a collection of relatively short songs passing through many rock sub-genres, Elvis Costello's second LP is as good as its predecessor, and it seems that his melodic sonse is even getting better. The main difference between both efforts is that the cuts here sound much more like parts of a unity, actually like `'songs taken from Costello's 2nd album'', which they are -  an important Leitmotiv here being a very clever use of synthesizers and keyboards, sometimes sounding like a weird electronic Hammond (!). Although his songs are more traditionally melodic, there is a weird sophisti-trash aura in the air that allows his second masterpiece to be as funny as solid, simultaneously difficult and easy. Plenty of hits and songs deserving-to-be-hits, it's a total classic among fans. Sngles include `'Radio, Radio'' and `'Pump It Up'', and best cuts include `'This Year's Girl'', infectious `'The Beat'' and shiny uptempo `'Lipstick Vogue'' with its crazy bass, weird synth noise and fine drum treatment.
B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison, the least respected Beatle, the shy Beatle, the quiet Beatle, bulls**t. And this album proves it,even when you least expect it, it bights you right back. This 1970's remastered 30th anniversary edition All Things Must Pass, superb. This album lets John and Paul know \\"hey guess what, I can write too\\". It also has some of your best musicians playing along side the likes of Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon, Billy Preston (the fifth Beatle), Gary Wright (dream weaver), Ringo Starr, hell even a very young Phil Collins, and so many more. Well anyways, the title track, good, of course My Sweet Lord, awesome, Isn't It A Pity, I Dig Love, the timeless What Is Life, Wah-Wah, and a double whammy one electric Beware of Darkness, and acoustic version, which I liked even better, very raw. This album should be in every Beatle fan collection, and I would also recommend the Concert For Bangladesh, best benefit concert by anyone.
B00000GUZP|3.0|Back then, everybody thought that an album produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers and performed by Debbie Harry on vocals would be an instant hit. Unfortunatelly it's just another record where the songs are simply too ordinary to let the project take off. Half of them co-written by Debbie, half by Rodgers, there is something strange in the air. Her vocals sound no more passionate then they did on 'The Hunter' (!), and the production is just average, with nothing here ressembling the energy of 'Good Times', 'We Are Family', 'Modern Love' or 'Upside Down'. First single ''The Jam Was Moving'' is almost catchy and still danceable, but it leaves the expectation that the second one finally delivers a portion of the album's best. What happens is that following 7'' release, the anemic ''Backfired'', is embarassing even for, say, a non-album demo B-side. ''Jump Jump'' is surely more fun than that, and was indeed released as a promo-only single, but after the disc flopped it seems that Chrysalis didn't want to release anything else out of this mess. It's not the worse of Debbie's solo albums, but unlike humbly trashy 'Rockbird', 'KooKoo' tries too hard to be the classic hit it has never been. For Debbie's huge fans or completists of either Harry or Rodger's work. 2,5 stars.
B00006LLOG|5.0|This album is the top of my list as one of my favorites, and it should be in everyone who likes classic rock, or even a Velvet Underground's collection. David Bowie and Mick Ronson (thunder thighs) help ol Lou Reed with this gem, and proves to be very sucessful with the timeless Walk on the Wild Side. It also includes others that are just as good as far as quality music goes like, Vicious, Andy's Chest (warhol maybe?!@#), Perfect Day, Hangin Round, one of favorites right here love the lyrics, \\"wore dentures clamp tightly to her nose\\", and even Satellite Love. I seriously think the creators of Rocky Horror Picture Show got their idea for the make-up job on Tim Curry, from this front cover indeed. This album is just freaky-fantastic.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Early 80s synth-pop was not supposed to be more than nice fun and therefore allowed many cool albums to appear where the star was not responsible for the songwriting, for the instrumentation, the production, not even the project's concept. It didn't matter, and a cool team was able to make a fine record by mixing everybody's efforts. Madonna's debut album, even if it's not groundbreaking, helped a lot to popularize synth-pop and post-punk new wave and is besides one of the most clever pop albums of that period. All the tracks are catchy and funny, with a very nice flexible use of synths that didn't sound mechanical at all, and a light, soft-rock rhythm guitar combined with Madonna's cool vocal treatment of the songs. It is doubtless her most solid and collest album to date, practically free of her signature fillers not even the hardcore fans really enjoy. Two top ten hits here (opener `'Lucky Star'', cute `'Borderline'') and maybe her biggest hit ever, the infectious party favourite `'Holiday'' are among the best cuts. Her first single, trashy sexy dance hit `'Everybody'' is naturally there, and the best track is the moving forgotten pop gem `'Burning up''. Commercially unreleased `'Physical Attraction'', `'Think Of Me'' and `'I Know It'' are equally funny and well produced, just in pair with the rest. Put your prejudices to the side. The best material from the `queen of pop' influenced one zillion acts (and I'm only counting the fine ones) and, like it or not, changed the directions of dance pop forever.
B00013RC8O|5.0|An open plea to the execs at DaimlerChrysler:    It is certainly a well-known fact that your corporate vision statement is to hide future vehicles in plain sight. With that said, it would be a no-brainer to offer the production version of the Dodge Challenger in a limited run Vanishing Point Edition.    These cars should be positioned above what will obviously be the SRT8 high performance model and be powered by an all aluminum supercharged, intercooled, DOHC version of the 6.1 Hemi with cold air induction and factory cat-back dual exhausts pumping out at least 550 horsepower (I know...I know...they would outpower the current almighty Viper configured this way!) bolted to either a 6 speed manual or manu-matic transmission. Stage III handling suspension, brake and tire package with driver adjustable ride settings (Normal, Touring & Track), 15\\" vented brake discs at all 4 corners gripped by 6 piston calipers and Y rated (186 mph) 19\\" front and 20\\" rear tires should also be included.    Premium leather and walnut trimmed interior also should be part of the package along with a walnut steering wheel and pistol grip shifter (Reminiscent of and paying homage to the 1970 original) bearing a signed and numbered gold or platinum plaque on the center console from the Last American Hero himself, Barry Newman.    For this I would gladly pay a premium over a \\"standard\\" Challenger!  :-D    Oh, by the way, the movie itself is classic fantastic!
B00004VXF2|4.0|Ok. This album is worth for what it represents in the history of pop/rock or whatever genre you want and in Lou's carrer. It also marks an invasion of a conceptual, protest manifestation of an artist inside of the music industry world. It's a piece of art, and a part of a much wider conceptual happening: a PROJECT. It begins by its conception, its recording, the cover art designing, and the fact that you did buy it, listened to it and jumped out of your seat by screaming: WTF IS THIS CRAP??? It's all part of the project. So this is NOT a pop music record in the traditional sense of the expression. It is much wider art, and inspired a lot of discussions many people had with friends about artistic integrity. I don't really know one single person who REALLY enjoys listening to it frequently, and think again that the CD release is bizarre since the''grace'' of it was the ''eternal'' 4th side... and the fact that it was a double album of noise/riffs, released in THAT moment. Since it's not exaclty the most audible record in the world, the grace of owning it is more symbolic. Reed simply decided to provoke everybody by recording an album full of pure NOISE. Check the back cover and the credits: it's f**** full of bizarre technic specifications and descriptions that should lead the fans to buy this double album until they see that Lou is simply slapping them on the face and protesting against the music industry and the hitmaking rules of mainstream. Nowadays it's even being used in art museum exhibitions and all - with people picking it as a double CD! - and the project goes on.

B0000033IS|5.0|For the last 20 years, Aretha's recording carreer has suffered a little bit from the poor material she was given to record and the trendy producers who worked with her in the studios, and the sparkle of her brillant, powerfull song interpretations was relegated to the live performances. But there was a time when the songs she recorded were excellent, and the central piece of that period is this album. A set of ONLY very good songs that allowed her to make use of her incredible souful voice in all possible ways, it's a classic from start to finish. Title track `' I Never Loved A Man (The Way Of Love You)'' is so f*** good it would make Kozmic Blues' era Janis Joplin hide that album from the world after Aretha publicly showed the right way to do it. Her biggest hit, girl-power classic `'Respect'' speaks for itself; `'Do Right Man - Do Right Woman'' is another classic and Aretha's own co-composition (!) `'Dr. Feelgood'' is so solid I must ask myself why oh why does she ask silly people to write hits for her if she's capable of that. Ballad `'Baby Baby Baby'' is touching and funkier `'Save Me'' is infectious, one of the central tracks of this amazing genre-defining album. Aretha's treatment of the songs, between gospel and R&B, is so strong that she makes everything she sings her very own, so who cares if another signature hit, `'(You Make me Fell Like A) Natural Woman)'' is a Carole King-penned track?. Lady Soul is a power to be reconed with.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Director:  Brian De Palma <br />Cast:  Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, William Katt, Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, P.J. Soles, Priscilla Pointer. <br />Running Time:  98 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, some gore, and language. <br /> <br />Nowadays, we have literal truck loads of books on how to deal with our tormented teenage daughters. We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film \\"Carrie\\" already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film; to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in a brilliant performance) is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother (played by the over-the-top Piper Laurie) is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens (played by Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles), who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period, incredibly late, finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out and of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing.  <br /> <br />With her the onset of her menstrual cycle, her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately, no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell, her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody, fiery apocalypse as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course. \\"Carrie\\" is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed.   <br /> <br />\\"Carrie\\" is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian De Palma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but De Palma does it.   King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. De Palma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre \\"Danse Macabre\\")  As is the case in most De Palma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a De Palma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and De Palma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after \\"Obsession\\" was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for \\"Dressed to Kill\\", \\"Blow Out\\" and \\"Body Double\\" are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. \\"Carrie\\" is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in \\"Sisters\\", \\"Obsession\\", \\"Blow Out\\" and \\"Raising Cain\\".  But it is the performances that make \\"Carrie\\" stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for \\"Aliens\\").  She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way.  \\"Carrie\\" is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. \\"Carrie\\" is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror.
B00006JJ2Y|3.0|'If you all expected that Metal Machine Music would have been the last surprise, just swallow it', Reed must have thought back then. He just strikes again by releasing a double album of live versions where, instead of performing (singing) his songs along with the very nice instrumental treatment they received from the band, he decided to simply speak most of the time. He criticises everything and everybody here, with no character/persona construction and no poses: it's simple Lou Read-himself, the man, and the many opinions he wants to share with you, like it or not. It's a really enjoyable experience for fans. The record gives the impression that you're there, in front of the man, sometimes laughing from his harsh words, sometimes wishing he would REALLY do your favourite song, sometimes imagining you're going back home to hear the definitive versions of the studio albums. But meanwhile you're travelling through the cover pictures and if it's your thing you'll like to spend this time inside of Lou's world. For casual listeners it can be a disappointment though. Begin elsewhere and then come check it later.
B00003CWPL|5.0|One could spend hours attempting to explain and/or intellectualize this film, but the effort would be wasted. One must react emotionally to this film. It's a nightmare. It's horrific. It's down right uncomfortable, but the viewer can still grasp onto shards of beauty.<br /><br />Without question, Lynch has created a virtually flawless piece of cinematography. All the scenes could be a painting, a photograph. Everything has a place, even if the place is without concrete definition. This is abstraction twisted within reality. Maybe, that is the definition of surrealism.<br /><br />This film certainly is a masterpiece - a definition of cinematic art.<br /><br />The soundtrack is incredible. It's subtle but intensely powerful. It can't be overlooked. It will affect you and how you react to each scene. Everything has its place.<br /><br />With that stated, the acting is captivating in a minimalist way. Every actor/actress is flawless.<br /><br />I've said enough. Enjoy the nightmare that is \\"Eraserhead.\\"
B000025XKM|5.0|I wish I had heard of Nick Drake before the VW commercial. This man is stellar. <br /> <br />After you listen to this CD a few times you will find that almost all other music sounds cliche and ham-handed. <br /> <br />
B00004Y6NK|4.0|Lot's of negative reviews of this album, and while I hear the point, I have to disagree. Then again, I'm working with a bit more data: I saw the tour that supported this album, and saw then and there what August and Behind the Sun did for EC. <br /> <br />Let me preface by saying I've been a musician for 30 some odd years, and and EC fan for about that long. I know many of his solos note-for-note. While I've appreciated the various incarnations of his lineups and sounds, August actually stands out as a high point. The reasons are manifold: funkier sidemen with better chops (East and Phillenganes), an interesting production style that is a mix of slick and edgy. This is not the same old laid back or rockin' blues, nor is it the country-tinged mid-late 70's vibe. <br /> <br />But back to the live show: the '87 tour was just 4 guys. No backing vocalists. No rhythm guitarists. No nothing...just guitar, bass, keys, drums. Everyone sang backing vocals. Everyone played their butts off. All the classics (White Room, Crossroads, Badge, etc), along with Miss You, Holy Mother, and Run from the August album. This stripped down lineup put EC in a different place musically, and made it so he could do what he did in the 90's. Without August, there is no Journeyman.  <br /> <br />At any rate, I think Miss You, Run, Tearin' Us Apart, Hung Up on Your Love, etc are as good as many other Clapton tracks (especially the first two).
B00005JKES|1.0|Of releasing a series on DVD without including the pilot episode that is. The original crime is discovered in the pilot, the rest of the series is about that crime. Why not release the entire series all at once in a nice box set including the pilot episode and maybe Fire Walk with me.
0312263511|4.0|Eugene Cernan was the last man to walk on the moon. When he stepped back into his spacecraft, Apollo 17, in December of 1972, another human would not venture to the moon, much less feel its surface for the remainder of the 20th century, and most likely well into the 21st century.<br /><br />Cernan tells the story of how he became an astronaut, his three fights into space, and finally his culminating achievement - his 3-day stay on the surface of the moon. It is an intriguing story, which gives insights into the many perils of space exploration, the stringent qualifications and training of the astronauts, the tremendous personal and professional sacrifices made, and finally the unique toughts and feelings of one who has actually cavorted and explored the moon's alien surface. As an amateur sky-watcher, I already had a keen interest in space travel and moon exploration, but I think anyone with even a passing interest in space or science would find this book interesting and a good read.<br /><br />I learned some things from Cernan's book. I was surprised at the amount of in-fighting that went on between the astronauts in regards to their pecking order for spaceflights, and the clashing of their (well-deserved) egos. I also learned about the many close-calls that several space flights experienced that were buried by NASA and were never made public. I also appreciated the conflicts and tension that being an astronaut had on one's marriage. Cernan and many other astronauts suffered through the sorrows of divorce because of the immense time away, and training that NASA expected of their heros.<br /><br />While not a gripping page-turner, this book is still an entertaining and informational book about NASA and our race to get to the moon before the Russians. The reader will gain personal insights into the people inside of the space suits, and will get to experience first-hand the experience of walking on the moon. Recommended.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig/>
B0000942QM|5.0|I had the original import back in the '80s. I had lost the CD due to a break-up. I had longed for the haunting and mesmerising vocals from the girls. I was astonished when I found the ressurection of the album (no matter how it is mixed). Duel is probably my favorite song of all times and takes me back to a time when my cares were minimal and life was simple. This is a 5-star+. I urge anyone who is considering this CD to break down and get it. You will not be disappointed.
0446310786|5.0|The book is about Jem and Scout live with their father, Atticus, who is a lawyer. The book takes place in the segregated south in a little town. Atticus is asked to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, on charges of rape and assault. <br />My teacher recommended To Kill a Mockingbird screenplay to me. I liked the cover because its country looking, and I like country. The book was interesting.  <br />I recommend this book for people who like books set in the country and who are interested in discussion about race. Also, people who like suspense will enjoy this book and some who know about court a little. I feel this way because it's what I thought. The ending was good, but there was a little sad part at the end. I was dissatisfied because something happened that shouldn't have.   <br />
0786890762|5.0|Angie Linton's review wants to know what universe this book is set in.  She is caught up in the dates and times of the book.  At no time in the book are dates given, so we don't know if the book ended in 2004 or 2096, and it makes little difference.  perhaps she needs to move on since she hated both this and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".<br /><br />This book is engaging, warm, sweet and touching.  I loved every second of this book and found it very hard to put down or get out of my head.  Ahearn has a natural wit and sensitivity and I found the story completely believeable and charming.  You won't regret spending time with this lovely story!
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Let me get the \\"good\\" things about this film out of the way: The super-wide angle aerial shots of NYC were beautiful. The crate with the Sumatran Rat Monkey set off a knowing smile (remember Dead Alive?). The bugs were extremely creepy. Naomi with headlights on. As for the rest? Not very good. How in the HELL did they drag Kong's monkey ass onto that relatively tiny ship they arrived in? There's NO WAY they had enough chloroform to keep the ape knocked out for the time it would take to get back to NYC. And what the hell was Naomi Watts THINKING following Kong up the skyscraper? She had the look of a woman who was desperate for attention - even if it was from a giant monkey - and was going to Stand By Her Ape. The scene of the men running with the dinosaurs was intense and highly kinetic, but downright laughable as there was no real palpable danger to be felt. It's a shame the studio likely forced him to deliver a PG-13, because what was needed was GORE and LOTS OF IT. I fully expected Kong to tear that dino's head completely in half, but no. I hate to say it, but the 1976 remake was more satisfying in that regard. I would have had a semblance of respect for this version if Naomi had decided to follow Kong by closing her eyes and falling backward, tumbling to her death. Wouldn't that have been a more emotional wallop? Right, like THAT'S going to happen. I totally agree with those saying her slow-motion, backlit walking toward Kong is among the worst moments in cinema - just absurd, and unintentionally hilarious. Why didn't Naomi talk to Kong? All she does is dance, juggle, and scream. Not having any rapport with him makes her look crazed. Even Jessica Lange knew to try and charm him that way. If there had been more BLOOD, more CARNAGE, and more DEATH I would have liked this more. But no - there's box office receipts to collect, and thus had to be watered down.
B00005JO1G|5.0|I have seen this movie twice so far, and was enthralled for every second each time.  I never agree with the hyperbolic ravings of critics, but I have to say that Gene Shalit's comment (to be found on the cover of the collector's edition DVD) that \\"Jarhead is more than a movie - it's an experience\\" couldn't be more true.  A word of advice before I start talking about the movie, SEE IT IN THE THEATRES, not at home.    Jarhead made me feel like no other movie ever has - it drops you in among the soldiers and you feel genuinely surrounded by them.  This is no doubt due to the unique perspective from which the story is told.  Through Swofford's first-hand account of his and his unit's experiences during the Gulf War, you see a very different side of what you would normally witness in movies dealing with war.    You hear Marine Corps jargon being bandied around, you witness initiation tricks/rituals, see enlistees in training/drills, and witness how Swofford and his buddies evolved from enlistees into Scout Snipers.  The training Jamie Foxx's Staff Sgt. Sikes puts Swofford and his buddies through is especially interesting and sometimes funny to watch.  The football in the NBC suits followed by the \\"FIELD F___!!!\\" had me in stitches.  That is part of what makes this movie's funniness unique - it is the Marines' own brand of humor - you hear them insulting each other via spouses, girlfriends, or simply due to appearance.  A dark form of humor emerges from frustrated, bored and angry mental state that many of the men appear to experience - who sometimes lose it completely.  At one point, Swofford pushes the barrel of his loaded M16-A2 into a friend's face and then, screaming, holds it up to his own face, begging to be shot.  In another scene, Swofford's buddy Troy breaks down when he is told not to take the shot on a target - his would-be first kill after months of waiting, training and sweating in the Saudi desert.    This movie is at times funny (very much so) as well as shocking, sad and mesmerising.  The cinematography is breathtaking, especially the scenes after the fire wells have been set alight by the retreating Iraqis.    While Jake Gyllenhaal is great as Anthony Swofford, Jamie Foxx, in my opnion, steals the show.  A man of multiple and admirable talents, Foxx portrays his character effortlessly.  Jamie Foxx is hilarious at times, while as serious as can be at others.  His charater's articulateness and Foxx's expression of emotion portrays Foxx's Staff Sgt. Sikes as an intelligent man and a true altruist, \\"I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps; ooh-rah.\\"    As many will know, this is not an action movie, and that is what makes it so great.  (Spoiler in following sentence) The only action we witness is that of friendly fire, and all other hostilities are simply distant off-screen noises (except for a brief scene in which mortars fired by an invisible enemy land around Swofford's unit's position).  As mentioned before, I would strongly urge you to see this movie in the theatres as opposed to DVD.  (Spoiler in following sentence)  There are certain scenes which will just not be the same on your TV: the scene where one of Swofford's buddies exclaims \\"Hey, the oil fields\\" and the camera jostles over the shoulder of a soldier to reveal plooms of infernos topped with thick black smoke in the distance, or when, on patrol, two USAF bombers roar (and I mean roar - it was defeaning and the ground in the theatre literally shook) overhead, bombing the Marine units in friendly fire.    The music is also phenomenal in this movie.  I have ordered the soundtrack but it hasn't arrived yet, so I can't comment specifically - but I can say that Thomas Newman's score was truly noticable in the movie, and complemented it perfectly; he's a true genius.    No doubt this movie will overshadowed at the Oscars by Gyllenhaal's lesser movie of '05, which is certain to sweep everything for obvious reasons, but it's the Oscars - since when do the deserving win (think Lord of the Rings)?    I can't express how great this movie was, on so many levels.  It showed a different side of war, and dropped you right in with the men on the ground in doing so.  It showed the bonds that developed between the soldiers, and the camaradeie that held them together.  Jamie Foxx is - as always - outstanding, and deserves Best Supporting Actor for his performance.  My love of this movie may have led to this review to be a bunch of unstructured and unexplained praise, but I can't begin to express how great an experience Jarhead was.    And, an afterthought; ignore any idiot - critic or not - who says that this movie is 'gung-ho' or 'pro-war propaganda' etc.  I'm a proudly staunch Democrat when I say that this is Swofford's PERSONAL ACCOUNT of the Gulf War; he's presenting the views and actions of his fellow-soldiers in this movie - not exploring or discussing broader political themes.  Swofford has recorded his personal account of the war, and that of the members his unit - it would've been amoral to let an attempted political commentary overshadow the movie, and that is precisely what he didn't do.  This movie is not discussing politics, or the Middle East, it's a personal record of a war, and anyone who states otherwise has missed the point completely.    I want to applaud Anthony Swofford for recording his experiences so vividly and humorously, and Sam Mendes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast for portraying Swofford's account so well (on all levels), and Thomas Newman for adding a layer of atmosphere that would've been lacking, had he not been part of this masterpiece.
0307276902|1.0|I was such a fan on this book until I found out that he lied. And then he had the audacity to claim that the \\"essential truth\\" was intact. Unbelievable. Readers deserve much more than \\"essential truth.\\" If I had wanted to read a fiction book, I would read a fiction book! But I assumed that, since it was billed as non-fiction, it would be non-fiction, or as close to it as possible. But changing a few hours in prisons to months is inexcusable. <br />The author didn't deserve to get rich off of this, and if he relapses because of the scandal, it's only what he deserves. Assuming that he actually was addicted. <br />The tone of the book-his voice-makes it seem so real. He said \\"I tried to write an honest book.\\" What hokum.  <br />He betrayed his readers. Oprah should have called him on it. The publisher should give refunds for this drivel. And he should be ashamed of himself.
B00009ATIX|5.0|For some strange reason this movie resonates well with me, I've been inclined to watch it several times. Fundamentally its a tragic love story with a happy ending. The special effects are fantastic, especially Solaris itself and certain pieces of the soundtrack shouldn't be missed in this life. In order to appreciate the deeper aspects this movie, you need to be well versed in Zen buddhism, quantum physics, comparative religion, psychology and appreciate art, poetry, and science fiction in general. Although, overall it can be a little heavy but better than the original ponderous Russian version.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Back in the summer of 2001, Hironobu Sakaguchi released the first movie to bear the final fantasy moniker.  It was a film that had a quality storyline, brilliant direction that segued from subtlety, to using scenes that involved symbolism in their imagery to communicate emotion, as well as scenes of subtlety and scenes of flat out action.  But it was also an animated film released to the western world, with preconceptions that all animated fare is for children.  It also lacked any real references to past final fantasy titles, so the video game crowd avoided it.  Video Game films also have a rather poor history so the general movie going audience avoided it.  Which left a rather small portion of the movie going audience that were open minded or adventurous enough to view this film.  Sadly, this film performed poorly at the box office.  The ramifications of this poor performance resulted in Hironobu Sakaguchi eventually leaving square to form his own company, and now Tetsuya Nomura throws in his cinematic attempt into the film making industry.  So how does Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children stack up? <br /> <br />One would be correct in stating that Advent Children deftly avoids all the mistakes that Spirits Within Made.  Its marketing and advertising has been in full blitz for the past few years, making sure the gaming audience knows full well about this product.  It is also a direct continuation of Final Fantasy VII, the Final Fantasy game that while being slightly simpler and having a story of lesser mature impact then past Final Fantasy titles before it, managed to introduce the mainstream gaming audience to RPG's with its THEN groundbreaking cinema's and uncanny Hollywood direction.  So the target audience is getting a film that they can immediately identify with and access immediately, this is all well and good.  But while Advent Children succeeds where spirits within failed, it also retroactively stumbles where Spirits Within succeeded. <br /> <br />Spirits within had a labyrinthine tale of faith, hope, meaning, loss.  It was a well told tale that had just enough substance too it to make you think if you bothered to try.  It also had stellar direction, and a deft hand at storytelling that rarely missed a beat or lead you down a path that didn't have meaning to the overall tale.  Advent Children on the other hand, feels like it was written by an eight year old.  The film starts out interestingly enough, with a disease ravaging the planet known as geostigma.  The story implies that geostigma is fatal, and remarkably painful.  This is where the storytelling and direction initially fall apart.  Rarely is geostigma shown to be horrid or frightening.  The most affecting scene would be the films main character, Cloud Strife, having a seizure in his arm before passing out in a peaceful looking slumber.  He is in no way debilitated by the disease, as the film shows him early on fighting with uncanny ability.  Nor is it ever shown to have any major symptoms.  A deft storyteller would attempt to make the audience feel the characters afflicted by showing gruesome deaths or other frightening ailments.  We never see any such signs, thus resulting in whatever emotional pathos we might have felt being rendered unfeelable.  <br /> <br />The film also makes many more storytelling missteps.  Cloud is also suffering from a sort of Survivors guilt, as in the original story of FFVII he saw his love interest murdered before his eyes, and feels it is his fault and wants forgiveness.  He mopes and pontificates throughout most of the film, and while I wont spoil how, the resolution of this inner conflict comes with a verbal exchange that lasts less then 15 seconds.  It feels as though both the script writer and director were both tired of this plot thread, and decided to dispose of it immediately rather then have it play out to any real conclusion.   <br /> <br />Sadly, the story devolves into the use of Deus Ex Machina for the resolution of its major crisis points conflicts, with the use of a spirit from one one FFVII's deceased characters showing up frequently towards the end, taking on solid form to help out in a battle, resurrecting a slain character, as well as treating injuries and tending to sick children in full physical form.   How a character that has been dead for two years do so much, I'm not sure.  The film starts off with simple spectral visitations, then loses control and has said character resolve all dramatic points to result in a happy ending instead of one with some dramatic meaning.   <br /> <br />Ive gone on length about the story, and Advent Children is a film that seems to pride itself on its action scenes.  These too are seemingly lacking any real care or thought.  The character of Tifa has an early scene where she battles one of the three new villains, in a contest of physical and martial ability.  This scene makes constant use of slow motion, and camera pans.  The action will constantly slow down as the two characters charge or prepare to deliver a blow, then speeds up to the point where the blow and several followups are all delivered in less then a seconds time.  The animation quality in this scene is atrocious, and feels more like a slide show interspersed with scenes that are played out in fast forward.  And whenever both combatants animate, its done in the fast forward sense, or is done with motion blurs.  The slow motion blurs imitate The matrix films use of bullet time, but they don't use it anywhere near as effectively.  The overall effect is ameteurish and silly looking.  And the scene itself has numerous moments where still shots of the characters move using the blur effect, which is as undescribably awful to watch as it is laughable.   <br /> <br />Following combat scenes are also similarly disjointed and bordering on nonsensical.  Cloud Runs along tree's at a vertical angle as if he is spiderman, and hovers in the air for a considerable passage of time while deflecting assaults from an attacker.  There are numerous influences in the film making, most notably from Hong Kong cinema such as Wuxia (Fantasy type martial arts films, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero would both be considered Wuxia) and John Woo's Hong Kong work are all referenced, but it is never imitated effectively, but rather it seems as though the director (Nomura be thy name) watched various trailers from some top ranked HK films and Japanese anime, and tried to emulate the brief moments of genious without any idea of the substance behind it.  There is a scene late in the film that unashamedly imitated Iron Monkey's final fight scene, with combatants leaping from structure to narrow structure, and catching companions who are in danger of falling and hurling them to safer footing or to a better attack position.  But where iron monkey used this dynamic sparingly, Advent Children takes things into the absurd with each character seemingly taking turns throwing and being thrown.   <br /> <br />Aurally the film is a mixed bag, I respect composer Uematsu as a composer, but he's done better.  This is mostly due to the fact that almost 1/3 of the tracks in AC are remixes from the game.  Nobuo Uematsu is a composer that has had his works performed in live symphonies, wasting such a talent by just using a large amount of remixes is a waste of his talents.  By and large the new works from Uematsu just do not stand out very much.  One gets the impression of a half hearted work ethic out of Uematsu this time around, which is understandable considering his having left square, and his work on AC was either due to a fat paycheque or contractual obligations.  There are a few instances of flash and his typical charisma, but they are few and far between.   <br /> <br />Seeing all the high ratings for Advent Children, one can only assume that people out there must really like the game of Final Fantasy VII, or be unfamiliar with much of Hong Kong Cinema, and easily impressed by theimitation of its flash, without the substance.  The story is trite and shallow, the dialogue is laughable and has a childs feel.  In one scene where a group of children are kidnapped, the character of Tifa (who is now clouds love interest) takes time out worrying about the fate of the children and nags cloud about why he doesn't respond to her phone calls, and why he spends so much time alone.  I had to replay the scene multiple times because not only is she nagging at him about everything under the sun, going on a mile a minute, but some of the dialogue was so trite I laughed at how silly the film was getting, when it was trying to be poignant and meaningful.   <br /> <br />I don't think Im asking too much for action scenes to have some semblance of direction, for animation to have a consistent quality to it, for the story to be able to have some semblance of depth and logic, Advent Children lacks any of this.  There are some moments of entertainment to be had, as the background characters of the Turks (think of an organized secret police of a large company) are amusing and have some great lines and scenes.  But they all come in too late, and do too little to save this disaster.  I've always found Tetsuya Nomura to be an inferior director and storyteller to Hironobu Sakaguchi, but his work in past video games easily surpasses his attempt to create a motion picture.  Advent Children is less a film and more of one mans Final Fantasy VII fanfiction brought to life.  I don't mind being the odd reviewer out by recommending this film be avoided at all costs.
B000AP04FG|1.0|They're both good looking and neither can really act.  When you throw in one of the worst screenplays over the last two decades, it's a recipe for, \\"Give me my money back!!\\"<br /><br />Everybody knows the storyline, but it doesn't make any sense why Mr. or Mrs. Smith demolish an entire house trying to kill eachother when all they had to do was own up to the fact that they were both hired for the same job by different agencies.  If these two are even remotely competent assassins, why do they miss on 98% of the shots they take at eachother in this confined space?  The neighbors call the cops and there isn't any semblance of destruction on the outside of the house?<br /><br />From this point forward, every cliche and predictable element comes to life right before your eyes. The horrible one liners when they're being fired upon from every possible angle, the tongue and cheek jokes when they're actually outracing four BMW's in a silver Astrostar Mini Van, the fact they're cornered inside of an aluminum tool shed at a department store and nobody blows it up while they're dressing their wounds?<br /><br />it's not good when you're praying for a grenade to be launched into a aluminum tool shed...it means the actors, the director and the screenwriters aren't doing their job.  They're just wasting everyone's money with two pretty faces and nothing more.<br /><br />They didn't even get Jolie into any kind of a skin tight, flesh colored suit, for cryin' out loud.  This film is/was as awful as 'Eurotrip'.
6305428557|4.0|I am superised to see some people rated this film so low. Well, even \\"Shawshank's redemption\\" has been rated one star by some peple, what you can say? There are always some people different.<br /><br />This comedy is sweet and funny, and one of my favorite. Actually Hugh Grant's acting is as same as his normal style, nothing exciting. But the whole movie is still great.
B00006JDS4|3.0|As a woman, I honestly don't know how to rate this movie. I gave it only 3 stars because, even though it was well done, I found it to be truly shocking in it's portrayal of female degradation. If this movie was meant to shock, it did a really good job. If you take the chance I strongly recommend an adult only audience.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to bore you with the story line as it's in all the other reviews. What I will tell you is this movie stirred up a plethora of emotions in me; some I didn't even know existed. I was stupefied, horrified, angered, and it scared the hell out of me, all at the same time. The degradation, humiliation, and assault endured by the key character in this movie are beyond comprehension. The revenge she takes on her assailants is equally disturbing.  <br /> <br />On the flip-side of the coin (human psychological instead of physical male/female), if I were to review this movie solely on the message behind it all, from my perception any way, I would probably give it 5 stars. Survival and revenge...inherently human characteristics...and...whether you admit it or not, we all have them! You have to stand in awe of the absolute strength of the key character's resolve to survive and exact revenge. It speaks volumes about us and our ability to endure. While I don't advocate ever taking the law into one's own hands, this movie certainly made me think about my own breaking point and capabilities <br />
0790737345|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. There are powerful choices made in this film, choices about love, mortality, immortality, sacrifices for love, and how precious life is when it's combined with the truest force of love.<br /><br />I really don't want to give away the storyline of this film (DVD) because it's an incredible experience. And isn't that what movies are supposed to be?<br /><br />Deserves 10 stars for the screenplay, acting, directing and cinematography.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you'll definitely want to, and I'll bet you'll love it!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence and Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE
B00005JNQA|2.0|It is interesting that the African crisis that is the subject of the Interpreter must be a fictional dictator in a fictional sub-saharan country. There are so many real African dictators and ethnic wars to choose from, to do so would have underlied the fact that the UN rarely does anything substantial about these situations. Pollack's reverence for the physical UN, clearly in evidence in the DVD extras, may have a lot to do with the story looking like something that passed through a bureaucratic approval process. High on the unintentional hilarity scale is the moment where the headquarters are described as a place \\"where things get done.\\"  <br /> <br />The telling Africa crisis for the UN was not the made-up Matobo but the very real Rwanda genocide in 1994. Anybody familiar with the international effort there won't be easily convinced by \\"the Interpreter\\" that anything major gets resolved in that building, by all those diplomats in all of those suits. Will the villain get sent to the Hague for ten years of checkers with Milosevic? <br /> <br />Kidman and Penn, the latter whose mere involvement kind of gives away the theme of the movie, have this interesting lack of chemistry. All of their scenes together feel like a bad first date, which could have really worked for the movie but for the very last scene. Kidman hasn't had any interesting work since \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" where the strained chemistry with her co-star was used brilliantly. The little \\"I believe in the UN\\" speeches that Kidman gives are absurd and little insulting. Penn gets very little to work with in telling his background tragedies. The two actors are probably too high-profile to convincingly embody characters whose careers rely at least partially on anonymity. <br />     <br />I won't give away the movie here, but it's notable that the most violent (and well-staged) event in \\"the Interpreter\\" resembles recent scenes in Europe and Asia - but not the United States. While such things are possible here, themakers of this film try to prop up the role of the UN by whitewashing some very recent history. In short, watching this movie really shouldn't convince you of the importance of the UN, with its big rooms, clumsy podiums and 1950's era furniture. Go rent \\"Grizzly Man\\" instead. <br />
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Damian Marley  -  Welcome to Jamrock  2005<br /><br />Universal /Tuff Gong/Ghetto Youth International<br /><br />Living up to the expectation of being the youngest son of a modern day legend can't be easy. But Damian Marley hasn't just stepped out of his father Bob Marley's shadow. He's strolled to his rightful place center stage, into the spotlight. On his third and most impressive release, Welcome to Jamrock, he's taken the roots rebel music of his pops and added the sounds of today.<br /><br /> Jamrock is a flavorful amalgam of r & b, hip-hop, dancehall and dub laid over some of the truest reggae our generation has to offer. Always one to keep his feet on the ground, Damian's songs are a reflection of the good and bad sides of life. With the ability to juggle topics effortlessly, the subject matter ranges from the social and economic hardships of Jamaican street life to spiritually passionate love songs, \\"The Youngest Veteran\\" always keeps it real. The diverse sounds of Jamrock are a testament to Marley's ability as a leader of the new old school in front of the mic and behind the sound boards. 11 out of the 14 tracks are co-produced by Damian and brother Stephen (who also appears on much of the album).Speaking of guest appearances, Jamrock's peppered with them. \\"Khaki Suit\\" finds Jr. Gong kicking it with the legendary duo of reggae music's elder statesmen Bounty Killer and Eek-a-Mouse. Hip hop's street-wise disciple Nas lends his masterfully aggressive flows on the politically charged \\"Road to Zion\\". And the unlikely pairing of Damian and R&B bad boy (turned reality TV star) Bobby Brown on \\"Beautiful\\" comes off much better than one might think. Acknowledging his roots (and family tree) Jr. pays homage to the elder Marley on two tracks \\"Pimpa's Paradise\\" (featuring a lyrically proficient Black thought of  The Roots) is a revamped and reworked version of his father's reggae classic and \\"Move!\\" borrows the beat and chorus from \\"Exodus\\". Although the true depth may be lost to some, this summer's instant classic and title track, \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\", is included on an album sure to be a classic itself. All that said, the centerpiece (and album opener) is \\"Confrontation\\", Mr. Marley's fiery flow, lyrical ferocity and sincerity are undeniable.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is every song on Jamrock jumps off. So the next time the mediocre DJ at your local watering hole plays the title track, approach the booth and let'em know Jr. Gong isn't a one hit wonder. Just keep in mind, \\"Rasta rolls Right\\".be lost to some, this summer's instant classic and title track, \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\", is included on an album sure to be a classic itself.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|After listening to the cd and reading the reviews, I just have one question. Why did they switch producers? I can understand wanting to \\"expand\\" their sound and experiment more, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Beatles went from 'Twist and Shout' to 'Revolution #9' all under the hand of George Martin. The former Stroke's producer seemed to understand them much better than the new producer(90% of the new record). With that said, I have nothing against the new producer, Sugar Ray, or pop music in general. I just wouldn't eat a pixie stick if I was craving a hamburger. The Strokes are still one of the most exciting bands in rock music. I won't go on and bore you with more rhetoric(positive or negative) as it's all been said before countless times on this website. When it comes down to it, I think the Strokes made a wrong turn, I just hope they can find their way back to Avenue B.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought this DVD set just for one reason, PINK FLOYD ! And I was absolutely in awe of their performance, and Wish You Were Here even gave me goosebumps! The backstage rehearsals were also very good and I would seriously suggest buying this DVD set just for the Floyd section. But there is more to this DVD than just Pink Floyd. There are also very good performances by U2, Paul McCartney, Will Smith, Black Eyed Peas, Green Day and many more. In short there is something for everyone. Lovers of rock, pop, hip hop, rap will all like this DVD alike.
B000000OAL|4.0|Although not yet sounding entirely like they would eventually,this Queen album launched them in America with KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE getting burned on FM radio.Wonderful songs such as LIAR,JESUS & MY FAIRY KING show Freddie's voice and Brian's guitar playing at their best.The influence of Led Zep and Pink Floyd resonates throughout.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|Don't waste money on this.  I like the suspense/horror films (top 2 would be The Exorcist then The Ring), and I like Jennifer Connelly but this one is just a flop.  First off, I was amazed at how slow it starts, the first 50 minutes are set up. I'm like.... come on..!!   Once the plot takes shape, its totaly predictable and weak.  It has no intensity.  AND... This movie should NOT be unrated.  It should be rated pg-13, there is no nudity, violence or 'foul' language... o.k. they may say the 's-word' like once... big deal.  The only positive thing about this movie is the way this part of Jersey is portrayed.  Its meant to appear gloomy, impersonable, and industrial.. and it does.
B000002J0P|5.0|Lately I've been purchasing a lot of music from the '65-73 era of music; examples include David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Yes, The Who, and even Mulatu Astatke, a very talented Ethipian jazz artist. (And yes, I already owned all of The Beatles albums.) <br /> <br />For whatever reason, it has taken a few listens of Electric Ladyland, Fragile, Tommy, Ziggy Stardust, etc. to really get into the music. That first listen never really blew me away; there were always 3 or 4 songs that I really loved and 7-9 songs that I didn't, before eventually getting into them and appreciating the majority of the album. <br /> <br />Continuing on my search for excellent late-60's era music, I skimmed over a few reviews of Crosby, Stills, and Nash's self-titled debut album and decided to purchase the cd. Yesterday I was fortunate enough to find the cd used for $8 at a local record store. I popped the cd in my car for the short 20 minute drive back to campus, and ended up driving around Tallahassee for 40 minutes to listen to the entire thing. <br /> <br />This album is excellent. Period. There are only a handful of albums that have had that INITIAL impact like this one had on me; others are Bowie's Hunky Dory, The Beatles' Revolver and Abbey road, The Who Sell Out, The Pixies Doolittle just to give you an idea. <br /> <br />Even though it is easy to characterize this cd as folk/rock, it is not folky music. There are tinges of psychedelia spread throughout the entire album and the harmonies between the three are amazing. The melodies are memorable, and quite a few of the songs are extremely calming and soothing. My personal favorite is Wooden Ships. <br /> <br />The production is fantastic and sounds beautifully organic. It has that untampered with 1969 production that leaves everything to the musicians, and puts a minumum on studio effects. <br /> <br />I usually don't do reviews, as evidence of the fact that this is my first and only review on amazon and the fact that I'm a pretty lazy guynaturally. However, this album is worth it. <br /> <br />I can't say enough about Crosby, Stills, and Nash. I've had the cd for one day and it's already in my top 5.  <br /> <br />Purchase this album. Purchase it again. And purchase it a third time if need be. It is amazing and you will not be disappointed.
B00000G3PL|5.0|It's wonderful to have all the movies together and be able to watch from the first hysterical movie all the way to the last.
B000002GYR|4.0|I admittedly was not previosuly a Tom Waits fan, mostly because I had never really been exposed to much of his music.  None of the music friends I hung with seemed to ever be playing any Tom Waits music.  Well, consider that period of my life gone for good.  Absolutely love his \\"Closing Time\\" record.  There is hardly a weak link on the entire CD.  I have been playing it late in the afternoon on my nice Tivoli system in my office for several days running.  I simply love the texture and feel of his singing on these melodies.  And from their feedback, several of my co-workers seem to enjoy it as well!  Now looking forward to purchasing my next Tom Waits CD . . . .
B000002OOY|5.0|I love dinosaurs, and I love the way in which they have been recreated in this luxurious and colorful movie. And certainly, John Williams' music couldn't be bettered! This music really speaks of a great sense of wonder, awe and fear. Wonder about the marvellous beauty of Nature and all of its creatures, in this instance the magnificent, pluriform and colorful animals called dinosaurs. Awe in front of the beauty of creation in all of its unfathomable, intricate beauty and detail (epitomized in the movie by 'chaotician' Ian Malcolm), and at the same time awe in front of the might and powers of human science and technology, being able to bring back to life the dinosaurs, already extinct for 65 million years (if one does not count in birds, which to some paleontologists ARE to be considered dinosaurs). Fear in the face of the unknown powers which may have been unleashed by this same science and technology (Jurassic Park as Faustian Tale; the dinosaurs as modern day Frankenstein monsters); the essential element of unpredictability (epitomized by the character Dennis Nedry).<br />The 'Theme from Jurassic Park' epitomizes this wonder and awe in a truly magnificent way! It's rich, sweeping, purely harmonic orchestrations are really sweet. The same with 'Journey to the Island', telling as it were: that which you are about to see will blow you out of your shoes!<br />The fear for the unknown dangers of technology (and inpredictability) can be heard especially in a cue like 'Dennis Steals the Embryo', with its eery electronic instrumentations. But the fear is already smolderingly apparent in the music for 'Hatching Baby Raptor'. And then there are cues which just underscore action sequences of humans on the run for dinosaurs (i.e. science & technology) run amock, such as the wonderful, highly charged (pun not intended) 'High-Wire Stunts', and later of course the fast and furious music for the finale: 'Eye to Eye' (Ellie and Muldoon trying not to become food for the raptors while trying to reinstal electricity) and 'T-Rex Rescue and Finale' (more running from the raptors, trying to reinstal the safety systems via computer - - being cornered by the raptors in the main hall - - ultimately rescued by T-rex, killing the raptors), with all of its magnificent piercing brass, thundering percussion and ringing flutes. Magnificent!<br />Thank you John Williams for this first class brain candy!ng to reinstal electricity) and 'T-Rex Rescue and Finale' (more running from the raptors, trying to reinstal the safety systems via computer - - being cornered by the raptors in the main hall - - ultimately rescued by T-rex, killing the raptors), with all of its magnificent piercing brass, thundering percussion and ringing flutes.

B00005JLEU|5.0|As an avid Anime viewer, I rent many titles for myself and my kids since we all love anime. I've watched many anime films over the years and this one was the best. The colors, the animation was spectacular. <br />Do yourself a favor and just rent it. Never mind what the few haters out there think. Think for yourself.
0684833395|5.0|While reading Catch 22 I wondered when Heller realized that he'd struck literary gold.  Was it during the writing process or later after the book received critical acclaim?  Although Heller wrote numerous other books, I defy any average Joe to name any except for the \\"sequel\\" to Catch 22 (called Closing Time) and the often considered \\"sacrilegious\\" posthumous Portrait of An Artist As An Old Man.  Nonetheless Heller ended up writing one of the most endearing, hilarious and poignant American novels ever. <br /> <br />Catch 22 follows the exploits of a WWII American bomber pilot named Yossarian.  We follow Yossarian through numerous missions and extra-curricular events in around his air force base and various locations throughout Europe.  Yossarian is a wise cracking paranoid fellow who often finds himself in the most absurd of situations that end up being revealing slices of life.  It's political satire at its best and one of the book's many strengths is the ability to change the reader's reality so that the absurd seems commonplace. <br /> <br />Catch 22 has many things going for it.  \\"Laugh out loud hilarity\\" is a phrase I've often heard others (and myself) use to describe Catch 22.  One of the funniest books ever, it gets better with each read...Yossarian and his cronies are loveable characters that you will come to care about root for to survive.  Besides being hilarious the book has many touching and horrifying moments as it deals with monstrosities and casualties of war.  To top it off, Catch 22 is more relevant as a military satire due to current world events. <br /> <br />Amongst my group of peers (mid to late 20 somethings), Catch 22 seems to be the most common \\"all time favorite book\\" and I would have to say it's top 3 for me as well.  It has a message, it's delivered in an entertaining way, the writing is more than serviceable, the characters are memorable and it has introduced a phrase into the American colloquium.  These are just many of the reasons why the book was a \\"classic\\" shortly into after it was published. <br /> <br />Everyone should read this book although its length and prose could be a challenge for the uninitiated or inexperienced.  Although some of the material is adult in nature, the book is appropriate for mature high school students. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A cornerstone of American culture, this novel is not to be missed.  A genre defining novel that will make you feel like you accomplished something important upon its completion... <br />
B000BP86OG|3.0|In late 2003, radio rock was lacking at best and nonexistant at worst; the only worthwhile group showing was Evanescence. Enter the Darkness, and \\"Permission to Land\\". I saw the video once, heard the song, downloaded the album and bought it just as soon as I was done listening. The flippance, the energy, the hearkening back to 80s glam rock; it was perfect, and it was just what the top 40 needed. <br /> <br />Fast forward two years, and we have \\"One Way Ticket to Hell and Back\\". I had expected their sound to change, at least somewhat (otherwise, they'd run the risk of being a gimmick band), but the new effort lacks a lot of the energy and fun of the first. Sure, a good bit of sarcastic remains, in both lyrics and titles, but just lacks that certain something that makes the previous Darkness album one that gets better with every listen. <br /> <br />1. One Way Ticket: Not a bad song. A good way to start out the album, but already I was feeling something had changed. <br /> <br />2. Knockers: I honestly don't remember hearing this song. That tells you something; it told me that this wasn't going to be a repeat of \\"Permission to Land\\" by a longshot. <br /> <br />3. Is It Just Me?: Okay fare. Somewhat catchy, but nothing really memroable. <br /> <br />4. Dinner Lady Arms: Same as above. <br /> <br />5. Seemed Like A Good Idea At the Time: Same as above. By this point, I was really depressed. <br /> <br />6. Hazel Eyes: Here's where the album starts to pick up. A sea chanty-styled tune that's both fun and catchy. Definitely the best song on the album. <br /> <br />7. Bald: A song about male-patterned baldness? Why didn't they do more like this? More songs like \\"Bald\\" would have made this outing really enjoyable, and perhaps even better than the first. It's funny, it's fun, and I for one can really relate... <br /> <br />8. Girlfriend: Again, more of that sarcasm comes back. \\"I love you/So what?\\" Classic! <br /> <br />9. English Country Garden: A very weird song, but a good listen. <br /> <br />10. Blind Man: Poetic, and the backing vocals remind me of Queen, as mentioned in the main reviews. It would have been a welcome addition, had the rest of the album been better. <br /> <br />That being said, I'm not counting the Darkness out yet. I'll eagerly await their third album, and then I'll make my judgment: worthwhile rockers, or one-hit wonders.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I agree w/some of the others - someone is taking this movie WAY too seriously.  This is a great, fun, entertaining roller coaster of a movie!  It's my favorite DVD and anytime I'm channel surfing, if this is on cable I will stop and watch it from wherever it is in the story!
B000002H33|5.0|Pallies, Metallica's Master of Puppets is one of metal's greatest moments. Songs like Sanitarium, the title cut and Battery are all classics. Even the instrumental Orion showcased the late great Cliff Burton whom was a better bass player pallies than that joke they have now! Buy now!
B00004U8JV|2.0|I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better.
B0006J28KU|5.0|two of my fav actors are in the same damn movie. oh yeah!<br /><br />but beside the good acting by them both. heat is full of drama and violence the whole way through.pacino plays the cop out to get De Niro and his crew of robbers.<br /><br />  the best the best part in this movie is the bank shoot out. and dearly noted this was before the bank shoot out in california.. this is a great film.

1592400876|5.0|This was a delightful, quick read. Lynne Truss takes on the tendency of email and other rapid-response technologies to send our written communications into a world of Joycean incoherence. It's a chatty thing, with lots of diversions and asides, such as the contributions of Aldo Manuzio to the wonderful world of typesetting and punctuation. This book makes a great gift for people who love books qua books and reading qua reading.  <br /> <br />Truss have a very pleasant sense of play. For example, in a section dealing with particular punctuation rules, she loves to display those rules she's writing about within the selfsame section. Truss is clever and lively and charming. Bookworms, give it a try. You'll like it.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Great mini-album CD remaster, the back of the CD is even black!  The concert is very tight and Bruce's guitar playing and band are in great form!  Each CD is a mini LP recreation, I especially liked how the lyrics were printed on the inside of the cover jsut like you were opening the album.  As for the concert, prepare to be impressed by Bruces band and guitar playing.
