B00CIFK316|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a book whose ten stories forever live on in the annals of British, Classic, and Mystery books alke. There is nothing to complain of here, excepting the bizzare display of the British pound (monetary) symbol, which looks honestly like a comic strip character swearing. The formatting otherwise is excellent.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is listed under adolescents and aimed toward a fifth grade audience.  The only major mistake I think was made in its publishing.  It is a book for everyone and perhaps more importantly the parents of those growing up.  We are the ones who guide are children to become who they are.  The book should be mandatory reading for the parents and not just there children.  Be an a good example and role model and you will never do wrong.
B009LDCZ7I|3.0|As far as I am concerned, Homeland is one of the best shows out there right now. Superb writing, directing, acting, and above all, casting. The director has been able to capitalize on the idiosyncrasy and weirdness of Danes and Lewis characters to bring out an emotional weight and complexity that  carry the series forward and make it irresistible for COINTELPRO aficionados and dabblers in psychological warfare.<br /><br />That's why I find the fundamental dishonesty and deceptiveness that epitomize the show  rather jarring.  The entire Series 2 is based on a terrorist pact between Al Qaeda and Hezbollah which plan and execute a large scale terrorist event in the US. That this does not make sense is obvious to anyone who reads the daily news - Hezbollah and Iran are waging a deadly war against Al Qaeda outfits in Syria, and Shias/Sunnis are vicious competitors in Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi and, of course, Lebanon (where the plot takes place in the first couple of installments). The show's obvious intent is to demonize Moslems across the board,Persians and Arabs alike. Christian Arabs are not above suspicion either - a terrorist tailor, Bassel, has a Maronite (i.e., Christian) name (Bassel/Basil). A CIA director (Saul Solomon) when asked how to look for suspects instructs: \\"Look for the dark skinned ones!\\".<br /><br />It does not come as a surprise that the show is co-written & co-directed by an Israeli who takes advantage of political ignorance, opportunism and pro-Israel bias that permeates the network (Showtime). In a nutshell, the show also epitomizes Israel's relentless attempts to mold American understanding of the Middle East conflict through media agitprop and lobbying outfits such as AIPAC and WINEP by creating a  narrative where Persians and Arabs (US citizen or not) are to be distrusted as a matter of principle. Ever seen an Israeli bad guy on TV? How about Arabs?  The real life picture is more complicated. Israel has caused US much grief by pushing, through its neocon proxies, the country into the pointless Iraq war, by doing it's best to  scuttle each and every US-led peace initiative in the Middle East and by trying to force us into bombing/boycotting Iran. The most sophisticated spying network in the US is probably that of Mossad yet we hear not a peep about this outfit in the series; nor are there any references to the de facto ethnic cleansing in Israel which keeps fueling the conflict.<br /><br />Despite excellent acting and directing, this show therefore works to undermine peace while serving as an enabler of those who are trying their best to destroy it. It is a simulacrum of the real world, a fantasy that gleefully  fans disinformation, anger and ignorance to benefit an agenda designed to undermine (to use Rush's term) the 'low information voter's' grip on reality. By providing us with good time it also disconnects us from the real world.rough its neocon proxies, the country into the pointless Iraq war, by doing it's best to  scuttle each and every US-led peace initiative in the Middle East and by trying to force us into bombing/boycotting Iran.

B0059XTV7Q|5.0|Stunning Film! Oscar Nominated for best Costume Design and Won a Golden Globe for best SONG.  Madonna Co-wrote and directed this film and it is beautiful. The store intertwines 2 lives past and present.  This film should have gotten more acknowledgements but sadly I think that the movie business hasn't fully accepted Madonna. This is a must have for any collection.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple, cheap, effective, software works great. I have had it a few weeks and don't use it a lot, but I've watched three or four movies through it (through Netflix) and I've shown a few Youtube videos to my wife and kids and everything operated fine. My daughter spent part of her time out of school this week to do a marathon viewing of One Tree Hill and she reported it worked great for her as well.<br /><br />I do not use it beyond that and at this time, I don't plan to. I can report that I've had few if any issues at all. Sometimes it loads a little slower than I'd like but I can blame my ISP's spotty cable internet for that. Still, it's a tremendous bargain compared to Apple TV (and I have an iPad, an iPhone and I am writing this review on an iMac, so I am not an Apple hater). My daughter has a windows phone and couldn't find an app for it, though she does have an Android-based B&N Nook HD+ that runs it just fine.<br /><br />EDIT: After several months, I've taken to watching HBO Go through it and it works well, too. Its memory of where you stopped watching is a little spottier than it is through Netflix, but shows play great through it. I am disappointed that Showtime doesn't offer support for it through an Apple app. I've read you can \\"cast\\" from your computer if you log into Showtime Anytime, but my computer stays on a desk in another room and I have no idea how to set this up and don't care to work to figure it out. Still keeping it at 5 stars because it's very good for what it is and the device can't be blamed for Showtime's lack of support.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If u have a lot of time on it hands then this is a fun game. But don't start cause u can not stop once u do.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|I find aliens terrifying. The very idea of being attacked, abducted, or suffering our planet to be invaded by something from another planet we know nothing about makes my skin crawl. So, naturally, I love torturing myself by watching lots of alien movies.<br /><br />The Darkest Hour is one such alien movie, though there really is not anything scary about it. The main characters are all 20-somethings from America who are unfortunate enough to be in Moscow when aliens invade Earth. We never get to see much of the aliens because they remain invisible for most of the movie; however, peril still abounds as it quickly becomes apparent none of the characters are safe from harm, and the aliens prove skilled at killing humans. There are a few jumpy moments and a good deal of suspense, but nothing overt (i.e. no gore, no gross-looking alien mutants, etc.).<br /><br />Despite some gaping plot holes and a script that calls on a number of tired cliches, The Darkest Hour remains entertaining. This is in part because the aliens aren't the slimy, tentacle-covered nasties we see in most films, in part because the acting is generally good, but mostly it's because the film takes place in Moscow. Russian stereotypes abound, and in one epic scene a modern day partisan arrives on horseback with a band of Kalashnikov-wielding, RPG-toting rebels to save the day. Hell yes!<br /><br />If you're like me and \\"alien invasion\\" and \\"Moscow\\" are the only buzzwords you need to hear to be willing to give a movie a chance, it's probably worth it to you to check out The Darkest Hour. However, be warned that you'll be expected to suspend your disbelief and overlook plot holes quite often during this film. It's action entertainment that tip-toes along two lines: \\"not really believable\\" and \\"over-the-top.\\"
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|Good book. Very well written. Easy to read. Wasn't wow'ed by any individual idea but was impressed with the aggregation of the set of ideas that make a very compelling case for allowing/enabling people to work remotely.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show got me right after watching the &#34;Pilot.&#34; Not only is the show interesting but keeps you at the edge of your seat waiting for the next weapon and proof and exposure! Great story line and selection of actors!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not quite as compelling as first two books, but I still enjoyed the book. I would have liked to see more character development for Four and Tris, and that is the reason to couldn't give it 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but HATE that you get timed out after a set amount of moves.  Then, if you fail to pass the level after a certain amount of tries, it locks you out of the game unless you BUY lives. RIP-OFF! It needs to have an unlimited attempt mode for those who aren't hard core.
B00FLDG5BE|3.0|I didn't notice an audio/video sync problem as some other reviewers mentioned but I did notice the video interference/noise.  It didn't bother me a whole lot but, it's kind of inexcusable in this day and age. I've seen cell phone video's with better picture quality. As for content Eric Clapton isn't the reason for buying this disc, not a big fan of his. I bought it for Sonny Landreth, Robert Randolph, John Mayer, The Allman Brothers, Albert Lee, Derek Trucks, Warren Hanes, Jeff Beck, Keith Urban and a few others.  No Joe Bonamassa or Susan Tedeschi...what a shame. I would have rather seen them than Kurt Rosenwinkle, Doyle Bramhall II, Quinn Sullivan  and Blake Mills. I don't know why they even have Citizen Cope on there, He's just terrible. Any of the other three Crossroads dvd's are far better in content especially 2010.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You absolutely need to read this wonderfully sad and beautiful book. Be sure to have tissues. I have said all that is needed.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Not your normal zombie drivel, this movie focuses on the hunt for the cure or rather, the antibody for the uninfected.  I am not a zombie movie fan as the constant almost comic growls and gore thing doesn't interest me.  World War Z doesn't fixate on the blood-gushing gore and almost avoids that totally. Lots of suspense, action, and depth of characters.  Recommended for the sci-fi, action fans who don't get into the blood-gushing, plot-avoidance of most zombie flicks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really holds true to so many feelings, love anger, sadness,and hope. Made me cry. Makes u live each day like it's your last.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Compared to the other four this one was rather slow. But by his own omission the author had a difficult time writing it. But I am looking forward to the next ne.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Can't put it down! I'm going to be sooooo depressed when I finish all the challenges. Definitely one of the best games yet.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This game is AMAZING....... you should really get it. The description might seem boring, just a little monster jumping around and shooting big monsters, but it's not. There are ALOT of world's u can jump in and discover. I will give u five reasons to get the game:<br />1) there's a free version, so if u don't want to spend 99&cent; because u think u won't it get that<br />2) it's rated 4 and a half stars<br />3)it's really really fun<br />4)there r lots of awards to earn<br />5) it gets harder as u get better, so u don't get bored.<br />If u don't get this version, get the free version and try it out. FYI, the free version only has the original mode, so u might not want to get it if you are going to have it long time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think its a great game the graphics r good and the weapons r sweet and the infared is a cool thing so all in all its a great game

B00ENYCQX8|2.0|This is a PERFECT ereader for your .mobi, .epub, and etc. needs but on my Kindle Fire HD it's saying something about my directory and SD card. I'm not sure but it's broken for me.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|the game is one of my faves, however I turned it on last night to finish the last bit of it and it starts  me over at the beginning. I was way to far to start over. I really wanted to see the end. so I'm kinda bummed bout that. wish I wudda created an account at big fish's website. if the game wasn't so darn good I wouldn't even care.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|I am a 54 yr old woman and I was introduced to Robert Glasper's music listening to WCLK in Atlanta and I was truly mesmerized. I then introduced his music to my 24 yr old daughter and she was blown away. She knows Im definitely a jazz enthusiast so she then introduced me to his older CDs n  WOW!!!! So we both became huge fans of his music. We go to every show when he comes to the ATL. This second Black Radio cd is awesome n so much more diverse - We played the cd all day during Thanksgiving because we had to continually hear it over n over so we could be immersed in this journey. He is the truth!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Speechless... absolutely speechless. I have read a lot of books in my life but very few of them have touched me like this one has. This book is about way more than the title indicates. It's about love, sacrifice, loss, devotion, corruption, and the many flaws of human beings. I would strongly insist that you read this book because you will come out on the other side with a new perspective on life.

B00G32OER4|3.0|I'm sorry, but I've seen scarier hauntings in the t.v. shows &#34;The Haunting&#34;, &#34;Paranormal Witness&#34; and &#34;When Ghosts Attack.&#34;  Why in the world did this get an &#34;R&#34; rating????  It wasn't like The Exorcist which had some really horrific scenes.  It could have easily been a PG-13.  The way so many kids are desensitized by movies and video games, I doubt if anyone over 13 would even be mildly scared.  The only interesting part was the fact that it was based on a true story.  But then so are the hauntings depicted in the 3 t.v. shows I named above.  I was really disappointed
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is awesome. Her drawings while simple capture the essence of expressions perfectly and she has the ability all great comedians posses of looking at human nature and making everyday occurrences funny. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|Saw this in theaters and although it's highly centered around one animal, Tilikum, which makes sense with the treatment of him and the lack of respect to the animal by Sea World, I wish there was more content as a whole involving these beautiful creatures. - From Washington state and have experienced them in the wild multiple times.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Such a fantastic read! Tangled was a sexy, humorous story that I couldn't put down. I loved every second, I had a huge grin on my face and found myself laughing out loud!<br /><br />Drew Evans is charming, arrogant, and flirty - a sexy player. There were times I really wanted to not like him and be mad at him but I just couldn't – I loved him to darn much! I loved his first person POV and the way the story was told going back and forth between present and past. It was entertaining and enlightening. I loved Kate and her tenacity and that she doesn’t take any crap. Drew and Kate had a big love-hate thing going on at the beginning that made their chemistry off the charts and gave a whole new meaning to verbal foreplay. So much sexual tension and then bam! they were hot! hot! hot! together. They're playful and have a wonderful connection – I kept thinking awwww and that’s so sweet. Love them!<br /><br />I enjoyed the overall development of the story, great build up and pace. I loved the humor interlaced with the seriousness as well. Loved the guy talk with his friends and all the incite that was shared. The other characters were great too but Drew’s niece Mackenzie was priceless. I loved the Thanksgiving scene!<br /><br />The ending really got to me. My poor heart, I could feel the tension. All I could think was poor Kate and poor, crazy Drew! I was on the edge of my seat with tears in my eyes, I couldn't read fast enough. Loved the growth and change in Drew. He and Kate are perfect. Loved this story!<br /><br />If you want a highly entertaining, sexy read with the perfect mix of drama, this is it. 5 stars!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Got this for my husband, who is a mechanical engineer.  A good nerdy little puzzle for him to work on.<br />He'll love it!
B005R32L66|1.0|It didn't work at all on my BlackBerry Q10 once I installed it.  On the first open, the app just froze: I never even got to configure the settings or even sign-in.  The &#34;waiting-circle&#34; just kept circling.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I thought this was a very fun book. I loved that it is a different take on the whole superhero thing. A world where everyone with super powers is a villain? How is a regular guy supposed to survive, let alone take these super powered freaks down? If you are a fan of Brandon Sanderson then you are sure to like this book.
0307887448|5.0|Born in 1980 and growing up on video games, this book was just awesome. I read it in 2 days, just couldn't put it down.
B00C8S9VKM|2.0|It was a collection of facts; I would have preferred more humor.  The section on the Federal Reserve was very short on facts and did little or nothing to explain the stock market crash to me.  Most of it is about Babe Ruth and Lindbergh - they were very complete pictures of two human beings and the world of baseball and the start of aviation.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the GREATEST Christmas movie ever made! Definitely worth buying and watching. Whether you get it on dvd or blu-ray it doesn't matter.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I enjoyed this film despite the fact it was criticized adversely by film critics. The plot is complex and requires the viewer to follow five different stories that are related in the past, present, and future.  The separate stories are not presented in chronological sequence of time; they are conveyed as events unfold in their respective time; which is the present time of each. The stories are tied across time to the end of the film.<br /><br />Life is three doors; the past, the present, and future. No matter which door opens or closes; another closes and opens perceptually as time has no beginning and no ending along the course of the human epoch.
B000FC146C|3.0|It was a good read, but got a little slow in places.  I wouldn't want to read it again.  The movie was more entertaining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun to play. Glad that it finally became available for download on Kindle..  five stars of fun for old and young.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is a fun game for this movie wish it was better<br />I like the game because of the robots.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It's a great app and I use it everyday, it's worth the dollar. I don't see any ads plus its only a dollar. I can draw and make blemishes on parts or crop things out of the picture.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game itself is fun, but the pay to play features are more than annoying. I have reached level 55 without giving in to paying. It appears this level may not be possible to complete without sending money. I am not willing to pay money for options to complete each level. I would have not even started this knowing what I do now. In the future, I will avoid pay to play games and simply pay for the full rights to better games up front. I find it helpful to discuss game versions with family and friends before spending my game budget.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my son loves the game I can barley get him off of it. But now he is quite for me.

I am very pleased.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love it it is awesome and It is much better then the other real steel app but they need to make another real steel movie.
B005QUQP76|2.0|I had trouble with this mouse. Might have been just might setup, I'll never be sure, but the mouse would occasionally just &#34;disconnect.&#34; The LED light would go out and the mouse would stop responding. Unplugging and replugging the mouse would bring it back online. My backup mouse for my gaming PC did not have this problem, nor does the Logitech G602 I bought to replace the Corsair mouse. Generally I love Corsair products, but maybe mine was just a lemon.

B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Excellent story about a heroic airline pilot who nearly saves all his passengers and crew after an emergency landing.  Turns out he has a bit of drinking and drug problem which eventually comes to haunt him during the course of the investigation even though his inebriated state during the landing did not contribute to any additional loss of life.  As usual, a well acted role by Denzel Washington along with a fairly riveting plot makes for an entertaining movie.

B000URWYTS|5.0|A very captivating novel. That gives you a glimps of the life Frank Lloyd Wright lead. A great read. Those who love his work will enjoy.
0399157573|1.0|I quit reading Patricia Cornwell's books when she started mouthing off about her politics. Who cares? Just shut up and write. The last book of hers I read was a few years ago and the first three chapters were spent ranting and raving about George Bush and conservatives. I took it back to the library. Apparently, these authors don't get that a large majority of people buying their books don't think the way they do - and they don't care. It's their little bully pulpit. I also think her books are getting boring.
B006RXQ3T6|5.0|Way ahead of it's time.  The HD visuals are spectacular.  Great acting and great writing in this classic movie.  Amazing.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Gerard Butler is fabulous.  Payback to corrupt officials and lazy prosecutors is very painful in this film.  Butler is a true star
B00498XRPE|5.0|An iconic sci fi drama/thriller driven by the brilliant directing of Ridley Scott.  An amazing cast who work so incredibly together making the terror of their unwelcome guest so intimate.  Production department miracle most notably in the opening scene as the camera slowly shows the audience the intricacy of the ship.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very addictive and fun game! You'll get into the game very quickly! Even though I've never seen the movies I thoroughly enjoy the game!
B00BHU261S|4.0|Anthony Hopkins portrayal is spot on from what I had seen in Hitchcock interviews and tv intros.  Opposite the brilliant Helen Mirren, an intimate look inside the eclectic and unrelenting genius of one of the worlds greatest filmmakers.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I'm watching this movie for the second time, and I still laugh out loud.  I freely admit to being a die hard Trekkie when I was a kid, and this movie brings it all back... except funny this time.
0736092269|4.0|Great book.  Very descriptive and easy to follow.  I have a friend whose just finished her PTA program and she explained this was a great reference.  Plus, it has been reviewed as a must have.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|This just replaces &#34;Princess Bride&#34; as my new favorite. Not sure why I haven't heard of the movie earlier. Great story, cute acting, good moral story.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|An absolutely amazing dark and gritty portrayal of the one of the best superheroes of all time.  The Nolan brothers are brilliant, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, and the impeccable Gary Oldman.  Great actors combined with great writing and some of the most entertaining action sequences seen in some time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellant reading  would recommend this for anyone who likes a good love story.  Well written  Keep up the good work
B003MAS9S0|4.0|Great sci fi super hero movie before it became box office gold to pursue the superhero genre.  One of the greatest opening scenes with Magneto being separated from his parents which sets him off.  Excellent flick.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game - good combination of puzzles and hidden object.  Never tried a game like this before but have enjoyed it.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|There is nothing more to say than I watch this movie many times a year and enjoyed the HD version even more.  Felt like a new movie again and looked spectacular.

As Chuck pointed out in the afterword, the novel followed the short story and then came Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter and David Fincher and the rest, as the clich&eacute; goes, is history--a cult following that spawned a movement unique in literary history.<br /><br />The story follows an unnamed (and unreliable) Narrator, the enigmatic Tyler Durden and the eccentric Marla Singer through a series of seemingly unconnected yet interrelated vignettes that are fast paced, intriguing, deceptive, inviting, hallucinatory, hilarious and shocking--such that a common idea, that of organized fights, is presented in a manner and in a voice we've never experienced before, which makes \\"Fight Club\\" un-put-downable.<br /><br />The Narrator suffers from insomnia and, as a solution, visits support groups because it is there that he feels people listen--they aren't just awaiting their time to speak--and he is able to let go of his inner demons, his low self esteem, his feeling of inadequacy, the monotony of his life, the shortcomings of his stature at work and with his family. Importantly, it is only when he began visiting the support groups that he was able to sleep. Then another \\"faker\\" named Marla Singer enters the scene. She appears at the same support groups, (even to testicular cancer). The Narrator cannot sleep while he knows another person like him visits the support groups, and he negotiates with Marla to split their visits.<br /><br />Later on, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a mysterious man with extremist ideas, on a nude beach, (which is one of the few contrarian aspects of the film, where the introduction occurs in an airplane). After an explosion destroys the Narrator's condo, he asks Tyler if he can move in with him, and Tyler agrees, but utters the most famous line of the story: \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\\"<br /><br />This is when the story takes off, as the Narrator's and Tyler's first fight leads to the establishment of Fight Club, with requisite rules including (1) you don't talk about fight club; (2) you don't talk about fight club; (3) when someone says stop, or goes limp, the fight is over; (4) only two guys to a fight; (5) one fight at a time; (6) they fight without shirts or shoes; (7) the fights go on as long as they have to; (8) if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Marla notices that the Narrator has stopped attending the support groups and calls him while under the influence of pills, which she took in an effort to overdose. Tyler returns to the house, picks up the phone to Marla's drug-induced rambling, and rescues her. The relationship between the Narrator, Tyler and Marla is cryptic, with Tyler and Marla never in the room at the same time as the Narrator, but it is her unique views on life that make her unforgettable:<br /><br />Marla looks down at me doing by Prince Charming routine with her shoes and she says, \\"I let myself in. I didn't think anyone was home. Your front door doesn't lock.\\"<br /><br />I don't say anything.<br /><br />\\"You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip in on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.\\"<br /><br />As the fight clubs spread around the US, Tyler organizes its members into an organization he calls Project Mayhem, which proceeds with a series of pranks and destruction against corporate interests. Slowly, the Narrator realizes, and dislikes, the results of Project Mayhem, culminating in an argument on a highway with the Mechanicwhereby, upon swerving out of the way of oncoming traffic, the mechanic declares to the Narrator, \\"You had a near-life experience,\\" and it is here we understand why the Narrator (and Tyler) act as they do.<br /><br />The reason that Fight Club resonates after all these years, (and I suspect will do so in perpetuity), is that most humans have inherent hopes and desires and goals, but we arrive at a time in our lives when we realize, (or fear), the ascent has halted, (particularly applicable for Americans, particularly true for Gen Xers the novel was originally geared toward, but no doubt relevant for millenials presently).<br /><br />The dream isn't attainable, whatever it was, for whatever reason.<br /><br />\\"Remember this,\\" Tyler said.<br /><br />\\"The people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on. We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and taxi drivers and we know everything about you. We process your insurance claims and credit card charges. We control every part of your life. We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't. And we're just learning this fact,\\" Tyler said.<br /><br />\\"So don't f*** with us.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line: Mr. Palahniuk noted that he wanted to provide men an outlet to rationalize their lives; women have \\"The Joy Luck Club,\\" after all. And in \\"Fight Club,\\" which some folks mistakenly believe is about a bunch of thirty-year old white collar dudes brawling in the basements of bars, he provides a paradigm that suggests it's OK not to conform. It's OK not to be the next Bill Gates. It's OK to live within your means. It's OK not to go shopping on Black Friday. It's OK to be frustrated. Because it is only when you realize your weaknesses aren't really faults, but can instead be a source of strength, that you can rise above, believe in yourself, and move forward. Until then, you're fighting the tide, its pushing back upon you, wave after wave, and you don't understand why you're losing--in a phrase, remember what truly matters in this 80-year journey, because when you take a step back, and think, you realize that your life is ending, one minute at a time.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|love this movie.  it's not for everyone.  many, many people just won't get it.  a person must have a developed to  certain level of personal and spiritual growth before he/she can grasp the concepts in this movie.  no insult.  we're all at different levels. movie relate the infinite continuum of time.  the concept is time is an illusion.  there's no beginning. no end. everything is happening and has happened and will happen.  it all happens now.  no future. no past. just the present. it's always the present. confused?<br /><br />if you truly appreciate the matrix -not just the cool fight scenes and special effects, then you'll likely appreciate this movie.  if you grasp the depth of the statement in the matrix then you can connect with this movie.  when you consider that most people enjoy reality tv shows then you may understand how come this movie frustrates most people.<br /><br />i own very few movies.  i own matrix series -most watched movies by far- and i own cloud atlas.  like the matrix, watch it several times and you'll glean new insights.  cheers.  we're one. we're love.  be love.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|Burkeman pulls from Buddhism, stoicism, cognitive behavioral therapy, and doubts on the concept of the self.  The mixture is uneven, but particularly in the first five chapters does pull from cutting edge research that matches up with ancient theories of psychology and mind.  The framing is against the positive-thinking movement is only pronounced in the introduction.  This is not Brightsided and readers looking for that should go to the book by that title. The chapter on memento more and Dia De Las Meurtos was a little more slight than I thought it should be so it cost the book a star.  The book is a quick read and gernally insightfully.

B000FC1I5Y|4.0|Frankenstein is similar to Bram Stokers Dracula in that a large portion is written in the form of letters from one character to another leaving the reader in the characters head. Not that it's ineffective in getting you to relate to the protagonist. Still a good story and stands apart from the films. Always meant to read this but never got around to it until now. It didn't disappoint

B003G4W49C|4.0|I don't read much science fiction but I really enjoyed this book. The pages flew by and I didn't see the twist at the end coming. I found the kid/man MC believable and true to life. And reading it in 2013, when things like the internet and tablets are a part of our everyday lives gave this book a currency that is sometimes missing in this genre.
B00GME9AJK|3.0|Interesting - but abruptly ends.<br /><br />I can't comment on how the movie aligns with actual events but it kept my interest. Abruptly ends without getting into to a lot of Jobs' true innovation in personal computing (ipad, iphone).
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Only the second Marian Keyes book I've read, this has long been recommended to me and I can see why. Keyes approaches the subject matter - a woman in complete denial about the extent of her drug problem - with humour and compassion. While Rachel's denial (and reveal) can sometimes be frustrating, I stayed up late into the night finishing this book. Recommend.

B004EPYZOO|4.0|&#34;Drive Angry&#34; (2011) is a cartoony thriller with supernatural elements<br />about a guy named Milton (Nicholas Cage) who escapes the underworld in<br />order to save his infant granddaughter who's been taken captive by a<br />band of satanists headed by Jonah King (Billy Burke). On Milton's trail<br />is a mysterious man called The Accountant (William Fichtner) and it's<br />unclear if he's friend or foe. Milton hooks up with an energetic young<br />woman, Piper (Amber Heard), and the chase is on.<br /><br />This is an over-the-top action thriller to the max -- a comic book come<br />to life. It's meant to entertain and not to be taken seriously. It's<br />also really funny, like the fat slob who immediately takes out his cell<br />phone to take a picture of the half-naked brunette beaten-up by Piper.<br /><br />Speaking of Heard, she's a little thin for my tastes but appealing<br />nevertheless and the filmmakers definitely take advantage of her<br />beauty, yet not in a crude way (although there are a couple of smutty<br />scenes featuring other women).<br /><br />The characters are of the redneck trash variety, including the two<br />protagonists. I point this out because some might be turned off by<br />their unwholesomeness. Despite their gruff exterior, however, you start<br />to see their humanity, particularly as the story progresses. Milton's a<br />literal lost soul, but he goes all-out to save his baby granddaughter,<br />which is certainly Christ-like. Piper's not quite as lost, but she's<br />just a product of her spiritually-bereft environment. She's also<br />dynamic and bold, albeit foul. As the yarn unfolds these characters<br />connect in a father-daughter fashion and their love and respect near<br />the end is almost moving.<br /><br />At the end of the day &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is about as forgettable as most<br />Syfy flicks, except that it has a much bigger budget and therefore a<br />slicker look. Regardless, it does its job; it entertains. It's similar<br />to the Ghost Rider movies, but without the supernatural overtness of<br />Ghost Rider, e.g. a flaming skeleton who rides a flame cycle, although<br />it has some of this, mostly at the climax.<br /><br />The film was shot in Louisiana and runs 104 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B-ains.

B002RI9HT8|3.0|Amazing story covering lots, lots of social issues.  I found it hard to read as it didn't flow due to changing of viewpoints written from each character.  Great read, though, to discuss with someone.  Sadly, 6 people in my Discussion group gave up after a couple of chapters and I had no one to discuss it wit!  It would make a great movie.
B00BATG18K|4.0|Although I liked this book the story was choppy and way to long.  I know the author took 8 years to write the story and it feels that way.  There are pauses in the story line that feel like she stopped writing for a while and then forgot where she left off.  Overall a very good story but it dragged on at times.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found it a great ride.  Exciting, engaging, and a compelling read. It wasn't always he easiest place to return to. The injustice, claustrophobic tone, and sadness of seeing characters you came to care about distressingly coming to hard ends sometimes affected me....but that emotional attachment is how you know the saga is a gem
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much, especially the in-trial dialog. But, when I was finished, I felt it left too many unanswered questions. Also, I realize that not all stories have happy endings, but this one struck as being quite peculiar.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|very addicting and fun. i have been playing it for two weeks and do not want to put it down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|But when I did, I could not stop thinking about it.  My parents always classify Mr King as just an author of horror stories.  But he does more, he also shows the dark side of humanity.  Which, I find, is far more frightening than any monster under the bed (or clown in the sewer).  The true horror he depicts is what we, as humans, are capable of doing to each other.  I'm glad he throws all the supernatural stuff in his stories, otherwise I probably wouldn't sleep at night.

B00EA8UEZ4|1.0|I am sorry but this book just didn't measure up.to anything  .  Gary's first book was a revelation and helped a lot to understand concepts of the course.  The second one was a bit disappointing as I was turned off by the attacks on other course people. You know &#34;walk the walk&#34;.  This was not written in one sitting, there was plenty of time edit those attacks out.<br />This one had about 1/8th of useful information. I really don't care if his masters are real or just a format for his writing. It is the message that counts. This book was all about his travels, his divorce and remarriage, restaurants and people he met. Seriously ??  How is this helpful?<br />He mentions lessons or rough times but not what they were or how he worked through them, which would be much more helpful.One cannot help but get the feeling of victim-hood coming through like with the second book.<br />Even the conspiracy about 9/11. Anyone can go on the internet and it abounds in conspiracy offerings about 9/11.  And the purpose of writing about this?  Or about HIS next life?  Readers of Course writers are looking for guidance and hopefully explanation of issues they wrestle  with.  Even if one sentence makes something clearer, it is worth the effort of reading.<br /><br />It is hard to write a review without it being viewed as an attack......but these are my thoughts.

B00F35B8F8|1.0|Poorly written and the plot is outrageous. Has nothing to do with the original characters. I won't spoil it but it makes absolutely no sense if you are at all acquainted with the original series and the movies made from it. This is a film made for the I-just-like-to-watch-things-explode-for-two-hours set of people. Which is fine under any other title. I resent them using these characters to sell tickets for gratuitous drama, violence, and a nonsensical plot. So disappointed.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Nice, fast and you can get flash to run on it. (UI is similar to chrome).<br />Try it, if you want flash there isn't much else out there.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is really addictive (as in, I almost missed my stop on the train because I was so absorbed with a puzzle, several times).  I'm impatient, so I did look up cheats every once in a while. I'll warn you that you have to do the puzzles in a certain order sometimes, or you'll get stuck.  But it really was a brain teaser worth working on.  Good mental exercise.  And the graphics are phenomenal, even on my little Kindle Fire.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The clarity on this Blu-ray is one of the best I have in my collection.  The special features and extras are also amazing.  I would always love more, but have to say that what I got with this purchase was more than I've received in some of my other recent film purchases, so I'm really happy with that.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|While it's not my favorite release by AFI, I find it enjoyable.  Is this a punk or hardcore record?  Of course not, even the band will tell you this is far removed from anything resembling either of those.  However, if you're looking for a heavily 80s influenced alternative rock album (that leans heavily toward pop on a few tracks) then that's exactly what this is, and it succeeds at what it's aiming for.  Does this reach the same musical heights that &#34;Black Sails in the Sunset&#34; and &#34;Sing the Sorrow&#34; do?  No, not quite, but it's a fine album in its own right.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Great extras came with the Blu-ray.  I also used the download to put the movie on my iPad and other devices.  I was happy with all that came with the movie, and the quality was excellent!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|this is a book we will keep to read again.  it is fascinating and timely.  one of us couldn't put  it down.  the  characters are  as interesting as  the plot.  it is also  a  reminder that  we have a long way to go as far as social justice and equality are  concerned.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is well written.  I get involved with the characters.  Nothing better exists on TV or cable.  Watch and you will be captivated me.
B00DEFW998|4.0|this is a lovely cd, with nice fusion of  styles and traditions.  includes music from Norah Jones, Shankar's half-sister.  some of it is very  Indian, which style  may not appeal to everyone.  wonderful, famous musicians, in addition  to Shankar,  accompany the voices. &#34;traces of you&#34; probably refers to Ravi Shankar, the late father of both  women.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I choose this rating because I liked the book so much.<br />I like this book so much because it was funny when Greg's pants fall and Manny called Greg a ploopy  and Roderick needs to go to military academy instead of Greg and when Greg's dad says he doesn't have to go any more that is what is so touching. For me it was the best book I have ever read or heard.<br />My name I  Tayo-Orisadare Pelumi and I am only a kid and as u can see I like to type and I am 10 years old<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />PELUMI
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app rocks !!!! My kindle showed that all my internal storage was used.But I deleted all but a few of my books and apps. It really started to piss me off. But the I got the Clean Master app and it removed and clean over half of my internal storage and gives me the option to move an app to my sd card to save space. Love It!!!!
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|This is just another worthy addiction to the Black Radio line of albums. He started off with the original Black Radio. He came with a remix EP as an appetizer full of leftovers and remixes. Now? He has some familiar faces mixed with more unfamiliar ones to demonstrate how his jazz infused sound and approach is only adding the landscape of R&B.<br /><br />If you like your R&B sounding like &#34;R&B&#34; music, then this album is definitely for you.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I truly enjoy this game.  The quests and goals are endless and captivating.  I would like to recommend it to all who love castleville type games.
1881273156|5.0|Thank you for this info and the details of this book .Love the details and ideas shared in this book !
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a good game and its really fun. The reason I gave it four stars is because you have to have a facebook account for some of the features
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|It is hard to compare SG-1 Alatantis to the first SG-1, but it is a great show. I always enjoy watch SG-1 Altantis

147676459X|5.0|Perhaps even more hilarious than her blog, this collection of short stories had me and my husband laughing uproariously and referencing stories for days.
0062225790|5.0|It very honestly provides information that helps to understand how his lifestory influenced Dawkins to become the man/scientist he is today.  Granted few of us could have experienced the unusual circumstances of his early years, but there is also something in his adaptation to those circumstances that only an inherent &#34;special quality&#34; in him would lead to the lifepath he chose.  The backstory of an incredibly intelligent man is an inspirational read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Makes you think and remember details. Very addictive. Took me awhile to get off some of the floors, but I was able to do so on all but one of the levels. Had to Google the answer for that one. What I liked was that each floor was a little different in how the puzzles had to be solved. Just a tip! Don't be in a hurry to Google the answer. Be patient and take the time to figure it out. There was one floor where I couldn't solve the thing all evening, but the next morning I figured out right away.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Appears the update issue has been fixed via the new Amazon appstore app update. Only took forever but at least I can update the app once again.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|In keeping with Disney tradition, plenty of humor for both children and adults.  This was a well though out &#34;prequel&#34;, my family loves it!
B004V9MU86|4.0|Was unsure initially about the story being told by death knowing what happens ahead of time, but the truly beautiful soul Leisel is really the story in a time of such despicable amoral behaviour.
1480569372|5.0|Why did I read Steelheart?<br /><br />I'm really not all that interested in superheroes. I'm one of the few who doesn't really enjoy the Marvel movies, besides the occasional eye candy. At first glance this book doesn't quite seem like something I would enjoy. However, since Steelheart was written by Brandon Sanderson I figured I may as well give it a chance. If you haven't read anything by Sanderson you should really change that as soon as possible. He is such a fantastic writer. I also love that this isn't really your typical superhero story. The people who would normally be the heroes are the bad guys and the heroes are normal people.<br /><br />Why do I love Steelheart so much?<br /><br />This book was fantastic! I have read a lot of books in my lifetime. Shocking, I know. As a result I have begun to find it difficult to really love what I'm reading. I guess my problem is that I know what I am looking for in a book and if it just isn't there then I'm not a fan. This book has almost everything I am looking for and I suspect that the few issues I found with Steelheart will be resolved in the next two books.<br /><br />Let's get down to business as to why this book is so fantastic!<br /><br />First of all the characterization is incredibly well done. I've found that, especially in a Young Adult novel, it's rare to get to know so many characters so well in such a short amount of time. I loved the characters in this tale, especially Cody, and it got to the point where I felt as if I knew the lot of them and could predict what they might say or do. I can't recall a lot of books where I felt this way so if you have any recommendations please let me know! The one exception was Tia. I knew very little about her besides that she was very smart and worked as the Reckoners librarian. I'm really hoping that as the series progresses we will have the opportunity to get to know her better.<br /><br />In addition to the excellent characterization I was really pleased with the amount of detail that was provided. I think a lot of writers struggle with providing just the right amount of detail in their stories. Some authors leave way too much up to the reader's imagination while others spend pages upon pages describing one aspect. In my opinion Sanderson got very close to providing exactly the right amount of detail, however, I am left wanting to know more.  I want to know more about Calamity and how these powers came to be. In addition to that I also want to see more of the world outside of Newcago. I suspect that I'm left with these questions so that I'll read the upcoming books.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed reading Steelheart so much so that I found myself thinking about it when I wasn't reading. In fact I'm still thinking about these characters and this world.<br /><br />Will I read Firefight?<br /><br />You better believe I will! I cannot wait to learn more about these characters and this world!ount of detail that was provided. I think a lot of writers struggle with providing just the right amount of detail in their stories.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had sooooooo much fun playing this game its very realistic and the horses movement is very spot on I HIGHLY reccomend this game for anyone there are so many different horsed from regular to zebras to unicorns no violence but all fun!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little gadget does a great job of streaming supported apps. At this point in time, however, not enough apps are supported. Also, I am surprised that you cannot cast a web page from the Google Nexus 7, only from laptops. Works very well at what it does so far, and travels well.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It takes commitment to keep up with the 6 stories interwoven in this book, and all of them are not equally compelling. I rushed through some passages and savored others. In the end, the unity of thought and the singular feat of imagination required to envision this composite of souls won me over. In short, it was worth the time and effort necessary to complete it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie and it is everything that Amazon said it would be.  I like the fact that it comes with a digital copy and I can watch it from my Kindle, computer, or smartphone.  The video quality is very good too!  This is a feel good movie and will make you laugh and sing along with it!
B003E8AF5U|5.0|It's entirely different from Oracular Spectacular. BUT that doesn't mean it's bad. It has great tracks if your into some spacey rock. Every album form MGMT is different so don't go into it thinking it's going to sound like &#34;Kids.&#34;
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I receive the Lost Souls: Enchanted Paintings Full edition from G5 for Thanksgiving and have really enjoyed playing it.  The graphics are really good.  It has very easy controls and allows you to zoom in to make it easier to find objects.  It is one of the better hidden object games that I have played in a while.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|What's not to love about Dexter? I now have the complete series. If you can overlook all of the cursing, the stories are fantastic. Plus, and this is a great plus, it has closed captions
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I love all the HexLogic puzzles.  They are entertaining and challenging.  You can start easy and then change the difficulty, so can you can re-do the puzzles in a harder difficulty.  I would recommend these to anyone who likes to do strategy puzzles.  HexLogic never disappoints!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Loved the show.  The musical numbers were great.  Actors really shined.  Sorry it was cancelled.  Hoping some other network will pick it up.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Not up to the standards of the directors previous efforts.  Somewhat formulaic and without any noteworthy storylines or dramatic impact.
B001QXZ81G|1.0|I bough this film one my favorite when my youth and I can nor see because is not for USA and latino american and I paid US$15.00 to return this film and NVER have notice of this return one to be useful,I do not recommended.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham's long and popular output over many decades has rarely been so well plotted and written.  His skills in delivering Southern legal system's nuances have been well served, not overly complex, just satisfyingly textured to make plot turns with driving interest.  Again, his characters fascinate without exaggeration, with two possible exceptions.  The judge in the case and the suicide victim are strange as lead characters that keep the plot flowing.  But in both cases they keep the reader fascinated.  This is one of Grisham's best works -- not as exciting as some, to be sure, but consistently involving with a final deep emotionally satisfying end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|hi! I hats writing game reviews but the app keeps asking me to do it. this game is fun and it frustrates the daylight's out of me. that's all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazingly descriptive writer. She makes you feel like you're there with the tributes in the arena and fighting the Capitol. Excellent book!!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book is a little sparse on details on some actions.  I did not buy the book to read about the domestic problems.  The wife's insertions were good for their marriage but not the read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great strategic game for your destruction of mankind, without harming a soul. Many different ways to destroy mankind, which makes it that much more challenging.
B00632HWOG|1.0|If I could change I would.  The old Yahoo was fine and easy to use.  The New SUCKS and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Why they had to change it is beyond my ability to understand.  You cannot go back to the old system, I have tried.  It is seemingly designed to be a change from the old system, but not a friendly change.  There should be a rating for less than one star.  One star means there is some social redeeming value to it.  The new yahoo deserves no stars.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|After you first play this game you can't stop it's so addictive  that you can only stop playing when your fingers hurt
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has too many messages to list here, but there's love, angst, determination, manipulation, all of it. Baz Lurhman's first project was a total winner. I watch this film at least once a year if not once a month!
B00B19DW0E|5.0|Good, classic, Action Flick by John Carpenter with the notorious bad man Snake Plisken forced to  be a hero against his desire. Movie as shown on other options was hard to view because the movie mainly takes place at night and with low quality you missed a lot of the picture. But the high Def brought it out even if if was dark night scenes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Read it in a day. Fell in love with the characters and wanted them all to win. Now I know why they made the movie.
B00002SWEM|5.0|What a fantastic documentary - musical. It's so interesting to see how each of these people started out and came together and created such a following. It's also neat to see ole Cuba (the way it REALLY is there) and how these poor people live. One of the few movies I've ever purchased.
B00G5G7FL0|5.0|I have watched every disney animated film put out by the main Disney animation studios and all the Pixar films.  This is by far the best &#34;musical&#34; film since The Lion King.  The reason I say musical, is that I believe Wreck It Ralph was also an amazin film, but did not have the musical, classic Disney feel to it.<br /><br />This is truly Disney at it's finest.  A catchy soundtrack, fun characters, especially Olaf the Snowman who stole many of the scenes he was in.  This is the first Disney soundtrack that I found myself humming to in a long time.  I actually just bought it on iTunes which is very rare for me.  Disney somehow continues to manage to put out a quality product after all these years, especially, when you think storylines are just getting rehashed over and over again.  I must admit, the marketing for this film had me confused as to the actual plot or story of the film, and I was really worried this would be a flop.  What a surprise I was in for.<br /><br />It is also nice to not have a movie with a main &#34;villain&#34; and actually instead have it being more about a journey between two sisters.  This is a speical bond that sisters have and brothers have with each other, and to have this as a theme is quite refreshing.<br /><br />Disney is truly heading into their second renaissance with Lasseter at the helm.  I believe Disney Animation is now surpassing Pixar on a regular basis, or at least two years running.  Wreck It Ralph was far superior to Brave, and Frozen crushes Monster's Inc.  The streak of films of Bolt (much better than expected), The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck It Ralph, and now Frozen is one of the hottest streaks Disney Animation has been on in a long time, but truly the last two of Wreck It Ralph and Frozen are destined to become classics for all time.<br /><br />Bravo Disney!
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Gave me nonsense to laugh about. Even little kids know it is not real and very silly. I have seen it a number of times.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Christmas vacation is a classic. My family and I have been watching it each christmas for years now and it has become a tradition for us. I can recite almost all the lines by heart and it always brings a smile to our faces to see it each year!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is awesome i love it great app. Me and my cousins can play it for hours then go outside and actually ride horses. :)))
140006922X|5.0|I have always been interested in the historical Jesus, without the religion-altered embellishments. This book is so interesting. Most recommended for Christians and non- Christians alike.<br />  wonder what Christianity would've been like if they'd stuck to what Jesus intended?????
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|This is a gift for Christmas.  I haven't played it yet.  I hope is will be fine when opened.  Every thing seems to be fine.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the best game ever! I really enjoy This game. If you play it you love it.It also has those girls who are the pony girls. I would give it a 100 star rateing. GET IT NOW
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This was an extremely fun read. The entire story just weaves together so beautifully that I found it hard to put it down. The characters are all extremely well written and the flashback chapters weave flawlessly into the main narrative that at times I was sad for them to end and the main story to begin again. I would recommend this book to anyone into low fantasy.
0891419063|5.0|You can't love what these men went through in the Pacific nor in Europe, for that matter.  If you put yourself in the story, right next to the guy who is telling the story and feel what he is feeling, you will realize that this stuff should never happen again.
B000MF4O82|5.0|This is an unusual movie, which I consider succeeds on all levels, delivering great entertainment value, with an element of being thought provoking.<br /><br />First of all, it is only loosely based on Heinlein's book.<br /><br />On one level, it's a science fiction war epic: the battle between humanity and bugs invading from outer space.<br /><br />It succeeds on this level with gripping action scenes and remarkable special effects.<br /><br />On another level, it's satirical: exploring the concept of a totalitarian regime.<br /><br />It succeeds on this level as well.<br /><br />Add to these the themes of romance, unrequited love and parent-teen angst.<br /><br />All of these are intermingled skilfully to produce an entertaining yet thought provoking movie, with glossy production values and a satirical edge.<br /><br />Well worth viewing.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|What can I say!? It's the Doctor!<br /><br />Can't wait for the new season to begin?  This is your short term fix.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Fun filled family entertainment and appropriate for all ages.  The Goonies is a classic that I was happy to add to my collection
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game. One of the most strategic strategy games out there a little creepy at times but always fun
B00G70WLJA|4.0|Entertaining like the rest of the X-Men movies.  It gets a bit off the Wolverine story line however so die hard X-Men comic fans may be a little disappointed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's really fun and enjoyable . It gets harder after awhile but still stays super fun. Also it is free which adds to the game. So keep running my friends.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The show is fast paced, the plot complex, and the characters well-defined....the perfect recipe for keeping me interested! Can't wait to see the next episode. It's like a great novel, a pager-turner that keeps you in its grip!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mcpe just the wait 4 updates!!! I h8 the wait!! If u could add own personal skins it would make my day! Also wtf about no horses but only hay!!!!!!<br />  Sincerely,<br />  Unhappy customers
B005ES0ZKS|5.0|I love crocs. They always bring the best to market. The crocs feels comfy and it is light and solid.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|because i'm can relate to this movie, denzel is the best actor for this part. he played a great great performance.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|As usual, Depp is incredible!!  It's actually several story lines in one film, which confused some of my friends, but I just told them, &#34;It's a guy flick!!  Women will just not 'get' tis film&#34;, and they usually don't!!  Still, a great movie!!
0393974650|4.0|This is not the story you know or think you know. It is a much more opaque tale, told farther away from the action than you might imagine. The result is somehow fresh and wondrous.
0780626966|5.0|I got this for my Brother for his birthday. He is a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan and was very, very pleased with this collectors box. We were both pleased to see New Nightmare instead of Freddy VS Jason. The interactive menu was surprisingly very fun and the videos and information it provided on the movies (interviews, rare clips, etc.) was fantastic.
0380730405|4.0|In my early 20s, I was much like our heroine, terribly insecure and nervous about what people were saying and thinking behind my back. I remember one time I was at my boyfriend's parents' house and his grandpa took me aside to tell me no one wanted me here and I wasn't welcomed. This was 10 minutes before we were all to leave for dinner. I spent dinner in a complete fog, nearly crying every 5 minutes. Now that I'm 37, I would have probably played the whole think differently. I would have excused myself from dinner feigning a headache, gone home, called up my boyfriend later to talk about what his grandpa said and maybe would have had the common sense to realize that grandpa was in the early stages of Alzheimer's and mistook me for his first wife.<br /><br />But in our teenage years and 20s, everything seemed so different and scary. And there it is, the scenery for our heroine, a world where she feels out of place and unwelcome at every turn. How different this story would be if she had a strong, supportive family member or friend who could encourage her and have her back. Or if she realized her husband could be that person. But what a different story it would make. There are a several instances in which various women in this story comment about themselves or others that they should have been born a man. Is it because men, especially in this age, are armed with the courage and confidence to meet their challenges and difficulties head on?<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is a superbly crafted story, but also a lesson for younger women; you have more strength, ability and fortitude than you realize.
0812973992|5.0|This novel is tender, thrilling, and totally engaging. I learned from these characters and situations and weaved through McCann's plot lines with pleasure.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|3D disk is defective and stops playing about 3/4rds through.  It is defective.  I cannot exchange it now, since I did not discover it until after 30 days of purchase.  For this much money, they should test their disks better.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Overall, it's a great game but I kind of wish it had more characters.Namely other characters from the other lantern corps besides Hal Jordan and Sinestro.
1567184855|4.0|Very fascinating study of patient experiences. It makes one think about our purpose here and what our past life purposes may have been.  Very introspective.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun. Any horse lover will enjoy it a lot. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It is really fun except when you beet the wall of flesh it doesn't give you through hammer/ I give this a 5/5
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was an amazing book and i cant wait to read Reached and see what happens with her and Ky!(:
0439023521|3.0|Lots of rapid developments in the plot, which hold interest. The book suffers from the repetition and overly simple thinking of Young Adult books. Remember, a synonym for &#34;young adults&#34; is &#34;old children&#34; and a childish need for repetition and flat presentation mingles with adolescent self-involvement and hunger for a sense of the accomplishment of uniqueness.<br /><br />Collins presents a brutal world, then pulls her punches when it comes to how her characters fare in it. SPOILER ALERT: the main characters kill by accident, to rescue someone else, to end a person's suffering -- they never have to face the main dilemma in the games: would you kill a person to win? This keeping skirts clean is quite typical of &#34;old children- young adults&#34; books. Not that there isn't some gruesome stuff in HG, just that the main characters stay pure and idealistic in a way that life would never permit.<br /><br />I doubt that I'll read the rest of the trilogy, but I would probably read the second book if I happened to find a free copy lying around somewhere.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I love these old world stories. They have so much drama! The character of Emma was a humorous one. This book is much the same as Sense and sensibility.
1402720602|5.0|I'm a lutherie student, just starting out, and this book has been indispensable as a reference for me as I work through my classical guitar building class.<br /><br />I also have the Cumpiano book which is equally amazing but the thing I really appreciate about this text is the quality of the photos.  You can almost literally go off and do a build just following the photos alone.  Ok so maybe not quite but truly the pictures with the associated text is amazing.<br /><br />Aside from covering an end to end build of a guitar the most valuable things have been<br />- The detailed coverage of building templates and forms, including a solera.<br />- Alternate perspective on various build steps from other texts.  In particular neck carving and construction.<br />- Again the quality of photos and text<br />- Thoughts on tools and shop setup<br /><br />What I'm most disappointed with is:<br />- The finishing section is very weak.  Nice overview of lacquer and French polish but I in no way feel like I could attempt these techniques with just this book.<br />- Not a lot of commentary on guitar design and theory.  For instance minimal comments on specific tone qualities of woods, or how guitar geometry impacts final tone quality.  Almost nothing on tuning your top or how brace layout and geometry impacts tone.  You will need to supplement with other books (of which there are many).<br />- This book is traditional in it's approach.  No coverage of fretboard binding, inlays, sound ports, or other modern techniques and ideas.<br /><br />Personally I think some of the techniques presented complicate the build process.  For instance shaping your top braces before gluing them down.  However there are many ways to skin this cat each with it's own trade offs so I appreciate the different perspective and insight so I can consider and/or try other methods to assess what works best for me.<br /><br />This book paired with Cumpiano has been a powerful combination and helping me build a solid foundation.  I highly recommend this book!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|WOW this is a very fun game to play.Every time MY nieces come over they always ask to play this wonderful game. It's actually better than temple run.
0896898288|5.0|Been wanting to get this book for a long time.  Now must put it to good use (by making quilt blocks).
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Amazingly addictive and fun. I recommend for people who like bejeweled games. My experience with this game was amazing! Try it<br />for yourself.
B00GWEPPE4|4.0|Nice to catch up with the Governor and see how other groups are faring.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game rescued me from Candy Crush.  I love the logic exercise of the thing even as I am cursing that darn raindrop to heck and back.  I appreciate the fall back ability to pay to resolve the puzzle thereby rewarding previous brilliance by rescuing you from current idiocy.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I like her new album.<br />She is just ART and POP together.<br />Es un CD en el que realmente arriesga y eso es lo bueno.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A great improvement over the first in the re-boot series.  Good character development and action.  I'm rating this above Iron Man 3.
0393038912|5.0|A true breakthrough in analyzing human history!<br /><br />So far in our historical analysis, most historians have argued that clever cultures won, or inventions. But the author puts an entirely new dimension into the debate: geography. He never says it is the ONLY factor, but he can prove quite well that in most cases it was THE decisive factor.<br /><br />Eurasia had many more plants which could be transformed into crops and edible plants easily. It had animals which could be domesticated, and allowed a food surplus and thus specialised people to exist. Also through domesticated animals Europeans had germs and thus resistances against sicknesses, while the Indians in many areas died 90% of them through germs coming originally from the domesticated animals.<br /><br />It is a VERY complex theory one can not describe in a few words here. It is not simple and easy, but still compelling as the author unfolds the theory. Yes, it is very different form every theory you heard, but give it a chance! It is a great read, a compelling theory and a new perspective!<br /><br />Highly recommended as one of the best books I ever read!
B00CL0J99K|3.0|There is a great twist (no spoiler) but overall the villain was not that great.  Tony was in retreat most of the movie which made for a slower pace than the first two in the series.  I give the studio credit for going in a different direction and trying something new to keep things fresh but they still missed the mark.  There was simply more action and more humor in the first two films.
B00G32OMF8|3.0|After being truly moved by the first two films in the trilogy, I have to say that this one left me disappointed. The acting was excellent, as in the other two, however, I thought the content just wasn't up to par  with the others. Perhaps it was because of the  darker theme.  I get the fact that at this point in their relationship, things probably wouldn't always be a bed of roses, but I just didn't enjoy the bickering. That said, I'm not sorry I watched it. After all, the three films were an amazing and unique undertaking, and I would recommend them to anyone.
0792839730|4.0|Great film, all star cast, well written and acted. Good plot based on historical events. Could not ask for a better WWII movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG!!! Minion Rush is the BEST game ever! Everybody says it's for kids but that's such a lie. I absolutely love this game! YEEEEEESSSSS HOOONEEEY!!!!
B000127LW2|5.0|This is one of the more interesting Star Trek spin-offs. Because they are on their own and because of this the story has to have a lot of story and cast development. Plus this group of actors really jelled into great onscreen interactions.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband. Watch for the foreshadowing. The real question is, who is Tyler Durden?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a great series high lighting John Adams life prior to the revolution through his death. He was a hidden part of our history to some point. This production was done by Tom Hanks production company. The writing is first rate and the acting and production quality is first rate. You will enjoy this if you like history at all.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|I really liked the first movie and I was a little worried this one was going to pale in comparison. Luckily, all my fears were put to rest, since I found a movie that is funny, has a bunch of other elements incorporated in the story, and leaves you feeling good. In the first movie, the conversion of Gru from villain to good guy was the focus of the plot. The challenge now was to determine how to carry the story forward.<br /><br />I have to give high marks for the ideas used to create the plot in this one. Gru is dealing with going from being a villain to making jelly and jam. In this setting, a villain is developing some scary threats and he is offered an opportunity to help the good guys. When you add elements of romance to this story, and some fascinating characters, the stage is set for a truly fun film.<br /><br />There are other aspects that make this movie great. I loved the fact that the minions get a more prominent role here. These guys are fantastic! The addition of Lucy, an employee of the anti-villain league that rocks Gru's world, is a welcome one. Kristen Wiig does an outstanding job with the voice acting, matching up well with the great Steve Carell.<br /><br />Overall this is an enjoyable movie for the whole family. Just sit down and get ready to have a great time.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|Great app but it crashed the kindle fire. It wouldn't turn back on after being turned off. Had to uninstall it.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Before you think I'm weird, little Derek is my Tom's<br />name. You could name Tom again, feed him, play with him and tuck him to sleep. This game is a good influence for taking care of loved ones. But don't take it seriously!
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Was  a great read, one of John Grisham's better books, A great sequel to the first book.  The characters came back to life as they were in the original
0553582011|5.0|I couldn't wait to get my copy, but when I did I realized it was worth every minute! Great book, I expected nothing less. Arrived fast and in great shape.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Best of all the X-men movies so far. Excellent writing, decent acting, and a fair bit of fidelity to the comic book origins.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I got this for my Doctor Who obsessed 7 year old girl. She is crazy about this thing. She takes it everywhere and loves how accurate it is to the one on the show. The sounds are exactly like the one the 10th Doctor has, the pen and &#34;invisible ink&#34; marker work well and she loves writing &#34;secret messages&#34;. The only thing that we don't like about this toy is that the pen and marker nibs don't stay on the end of the screwdriver very well. If any pressure is applied (like when you write) it pops right off. My daughter has found that she can still use them if she holds it really close to the tip to write, but it is still a little frustrating. All in all though, she loves the toy and has already spent hours &#34;fighting aliens and saving Earth&#34;. Lol as a fellow fan, I also think it is pretty awesome and have played with it a little myself. I would recommend this toy to others! :)
B008M721MS|1.0|only works on kindle fire hd and I'm not upgrading from my kindle fire for this app, so I guess I'm SOL unless I can find a different way to download it. its all part of the corporate push to make us spend more money. suck it, amazon.
B002DOSBMK|3.0|This is not a reflection on Mr. Salvatore's writing.  I just found this series too be too dark for me.  He is an excellent writer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app!!! &quot;Die Bitch has eraticated the world&quot; This game is too fun. I hope they add to it.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It is fun but locks the screen too often. reboot clears it but it is annoying. I hope they fix it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I know it sounds kinda crazy saying that I hate boks now because of this book but im sorry she totally messed it up.I hope your ready for some pretty boring reading and a tissue box.I have to admit I wanted the ending to be more like a fairytale..wasnt planning it to be the smell of death .-.<br />  She also made it very confusing she had tobias point of view I realy hated t because I think beatris was really a uniqe character...tobias also started to annoy me .-. just some of the things he said and also did<br />************************************************  SPOILER ALERT: there is alot of death and depression in this book if you like to read those kinds of things I suppose you could read it if you want.<br />if u dont really like death so much then I would not recomend this book I wouldnt even recomen it by its self I jusr wish she would have picked a differnt kind of path of how she went.I found that I didnt like reading tobias mind I think she could have made his own book also the chapters were confusing,I sometimes didnt know if it was beatris or tobias talking.<br />************************************************  I guess to me this book was a big let down now I dont wanna read any seirs because I was so dissapointed and depressed of how the book came to an end .-.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|A very suspenseful, action packed and intriguing film.  Well acted.  Second time seeing this film and it was as good as the first time we saw it.  Highly recommended film.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Was alittle confusing at first. Had to read then reread. Would like to use when emailing. Still trying to figure out how to use.
B008G12ERC|5.0|It's Muse...'nuff said.  This is their latest album, kind of a mix between Ultravox, U2 and Queen...you either like them or you don't!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Interesting and fun movie about revenge and magic. Was interesting to see the story come together with one surprise after another.
B00ANJJFUY|5.0|These gorgeous purple mary jane crocs are everything I expected them to be. The fit is perfect. The comfort is amazing. I adore the colour. I call these my Happy Shoes.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I found &amp;started playing this game 3-4 weeks ago &amp; have really enjoyed it. I advanced through the levels &amp; had about 5 scenes I was working out of. I opened the game about 3 days ago &amp; found that everything had been erased &amp; my game completely started over. If this had not happened I would've given 5 stars.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin brings us the enlightenment of the genius of Lincoln, in his empathetic management of people who he recognizes as having the talents and strengths that he needs to guide the country back to reconstruction and the political genius to bring disparate individuals to a single path to success. The book brought me to appreciate what Lincoln achieved and to realize the great loss for a truly unified country that could have been achieved so much better and with a more acceptable resolution for the reconstruction by the South.  I will be reading Goodwin's book on the Roosevelts hoping that it has the same enlightenment of their ingenuity.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|This 2nd part of the trilogy is literally disappointing in comparison to both the 1st book and everything else that Ken Follet (whom we've always admired and enjoyed for many years) has written.  The intricate story line spanning the same families on different continents throughout World War II is interesting, but far too simplistic. Hope Century Trilogy 3 will be better!
B0031RG846|4.0|Very nice detail. Will be giving it to my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She should love it for her collection.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Being a HARRY POTTER fanatic (and a grandma of 5) I was very excited at the prospect of reading her first &#34;Adult&#34; novel. But actually, in my opinion, the incredible Harry Potter journey (so intricately and brilliantly woven from Book 1 to Book 7) is definitely not just for children, but most certainly also for any discerning adult. The Casual Vacancy - though well written and quite clever - was not riveting. It was &#34;dark&#34; and not very enjoyable. Such a pity!  I have always been convinced that J.K. Rowlings is a pure genius, and she can deliver far better than this book.
B0088TG252|3.0|The world’s most-wanted double, no, triple agent just turned himself in. An ambitious CIA safe house watcher is tasked with keeping him safe until relief arrives. That’s no easy mission when he can’t trust anyone- not even himself.<br />Safe House: No one is Safe<br /><br />A shepherd needs to bring in a sheep that may be a wolf instead.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays counter-intelligence-super-spy Tobin Frost who has been selling secrets to every side for years. Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) stars opposite as the promotion-hungry CIA agent stuck in the dead-end job of watching over safe houses. In most movies, safe houses are places police and the FBI use to hide key witnesses that are unsafe anywhere else. In this arena, the safe house is an extraction point where individuals of interest are stored, interrogated and/or tortured if need be.<br /><br />This is a familiar role for Washington who taps in to his Alonzo from Training Day style to create a character that appears wholly evil, but possible a misunderstood shepherd in sheep’s clothing. It’s a solid film that creates an paranoid atmosphere of who’s out to get me and friend or foe at every turn. I give the movie extra credit for a nice turn that’s not a twist. You know what to expect: worthy interactions between characters, a few tightly done and suspenseful action sequences and a small moral question of how intelligently the intelligence branch of our government operates. Worth renting, but I wouldn’t add I to my collection at full price. I’m no movie critic; I’m just critiquing a movie.
B001AQO3QA|1.0|I was very excited about this set at the price until the second film, Aliens, would not play. Amazon issued me a new set and again it would not play. After some research I realized that this is an all region import, from where I do not know, but all region discs are notorious for having playback problems in many North America players. I am sending mine back for a refund and you should be very careful to be sure any discs you buy say region 1 or A in North America. Too bad too because there are a lot of extras, although the transfers on the other films are not so good but then again it's not an official north american release and not subject to the same standards.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|A really good movie if you ignore who made and who is in it.<br /><br />I’m kicking myself for being talked out of seeing this in theaters. I had no idea what it was about and was nervous because it was an M Night Shyamalan movie. What’s that got to do with anything? Well, Shyamalan is best known for The Sixth Sense (1999) which gave us a bend on the surprise ending no one saw coming. It’s a formula he repeated in movies like Signs (2002) and Lady in the Water (2006). Movies, where everything fits together, at the end, and you get to see all the little points along the way add up to a big finish. In my opinion Unbreakable (2000) is a classic and gives us the realest depiction of a super-hero without using a comic-based format, but includes every motif and clich&eacute;. See, movies like The Village (2004) and The Happening (2008) left many with questions about his continued ability to deliver at his highest potential. After all, Devil (2010) was another won’t-tell-you-the-plot-until-you-see-it and the curious pay off wasn’t as revealing as it could have been. Let’s just say we didn’t see the Saw [a reference to the 2004 horror flick] in this movie.<br /><br />Will Smith presents another problem for potential movie-goers as his star power and box-office draw was super-high then. And so you expect another blockbuster- another big movie and wow, his son Jaden Smith co-stars, well, really stars. (The Karate Kid 2010 wasn’t as good as the original, but was way better than any of its sequels so….) I’m saying expectations may have been too high and perhaps another mysterious movie with a surprise ending may not be the best formula to run with.<br /><br />Proper Plots<br /><br />Let’s cover what the movie is really about and get down for the set up. It’s far into the future and Earth has been lost to the self-inflicted wounds of environmental pollution. We flee to the stars and find ourselves in a war with aliens. Will Smith plays General Kitai Raige and during a space voyage, their transport is crippled and it’s up to not-yet-a-space-ranger Jaden (as Cypher Raige) to cross the dangerous landscape to reach help. Is Will Smith in the movie? Yes, and it’s not a goofy hologram or ghost, but the movie is the debut of a young action hero in the making. I can dig it. And I also see what the second problem is. You wanted Will Smith to be bounding over those rocks, facing peril and outlined against wondrous vistas. And maybe you wanted some kind of big message at the end or some sort of moral statement with all kinds of pretentious and righteous writer wit. No, you get the story of a father standing by and letting his son brave a new and hostile world. That’s true- for both the Raige and Smith families, for After Earth and Hollywood.<br /><br />After the… Earth summary<br /><br />Certainly it’s no spoiler to tell you -there is no big-surprise ending or twist and the movie flows and unfolds as expected. Yes, you can relax without worrying if M Night is going to ruin it in the last five minutes. If you have a family that might enjoy and sci-fi tale, this is a solid movie. If you expect…the expected movie from Will Smith + Shyamalan you will be, like many = disappointed. Me, I enjoyed it.uring a space voyage, their transport is crippled and it’s up to not-yet-a-space-ranger Jaden (as Cypher Raige) to cross the dangerous landscape to reach help.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google if by far the best search engine on the internet.  I use it to find everything on the web!
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Three friends discover an energy force that endows them with super-human abilities and changes their friendship. One is seduced by that power and embraces the idea that he is the apex predator. He is at the top of the food chain and feels no guilt for his actions, no matter how they may impact others further down the chain.<br />Chronicle movie poster<br /><br />What if you suddenly became a god?<br /><br />Director Josh Trank uses the hand-held camera technique to document the lives of three high school seniors as they become young gods after discovering an (alien?) force. There’s not much more to the movie than that plot summary so really, if you’ve ever wondered what if you gained super powers…and what would you do? The trick is to show us something that is so ordinary that it’s special and thanks to good writing by Max Landis and Trank, we get that. I’m not suggesting this is a greatly written movie, I’m suggesting that it has been written to steer us in a certain way that retains realism and believability.<br /><br />Blair Witch showed us how effective documentary styled filming can be and Cloverfield showed us how it can be used to bring on the cheese. You always have that nagging voice in the back of your mind- asking about tape and battery time and you wonder if someone would really, really be filming this much. In this case it works well and the camera slides into normalcy and you forget its first-person and just watch the onscreen action. The special effects are well done and seem even more realistic when combined with the lo-fi camera grain.<br /><br />Back to the writing. It’s important to note that what’s been written out is just as important as what’s been written in. There’s the clich&eacute; of the trio. We have a loner (Dane DeHaan), Mr Popularity (Michael B Jordan) and a too-cool-for-my-own-life pseudo-intellectual (Alex Russel). The reason they work well together is because each posses the qualities another lacks and it keeps them focused on group concerns: exploring their new powers and getting stronger.<br /><br />In younger days, I and my friends would play ‘Adventure’ which was basically Dungeons & Dragons without the paper and dice. We would build scenarios and talk our way through our actions and create a story in real time. You do or say this and this is what happens after. You react and do that and here’s what happens next. In the earliest games, we spent our time exacting revenge on those that wronged us and getting the girl we wanted. Eventually thoughts about our real non-life seemed unimportant and we began to think about being super-heroes and fighting other beings with powers and becoming worldly beacons of justice. Really, we did.<br /><br />Chronicle could follow that same ambition process, but we are narrowly focused on this trio and the early days of their enhancement. High School life is still most important, and should be because that is all the characters know. We don’t get answers for where the energy source came from and do not explore any of the hinted at tangents -like the world and government reaction to some of the incredible events the trio is at the center of. There’s a built in break for using the hand-held documentary style because you can say: if it wasn’t filmed by this guy then we can’t show it to you. That’s broken up in some nice shots where surveillance camera footage is spliced in at key moments.<br /><br />Of course in any movie, you can criticize the actions of the main characters and figure you could have done better in their position. One character needs cash and so he robs the local (presumed) drug dealing a-holes. That’s not enough so he robs a gas station. At first I thought with those powers why isn’t he making tons of cash or if you’re going to rob something, rob an ATM or bank…but these are simple characters acting on impulse. This is a simple movie trying to explore what some would do if they suddenly became infusedwith super-human powers. Sometimes we come back with complex answers when in truth; it might all be as simple as this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the ending had a much bigger climax than I expected.

B008C20TDG|4.0|Great info. Makes much more sense and feels more right. I've gone grain free before reading this, so I had a head start. Lots of visceral fat lost already. Going ahead with the rest of the program to see if my skin sensitivity is related to dairy.
B004LRNYJW|5.0|This movie is the remake of the Swedish &#34;Let the right one in.&#34; This is a great improvement on the original and really shows some great acting.  Must see for the people who want a little more to their creepy flick!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love heros of order chaos because I just<br />Love it is so great to play this game with my friends
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and frustration for all ages!  Love it!  Glad it finally was made available for Kindle.  Now I'll never get anything done!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly. I wish there is more supported apps (e.g. NetFlix does not work in my country). This way, I could only use it for YouTube.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I couldn't live without my Facebook, and all my Oregon Duck Fans, friends, and family. Communication is the key to daily fun.
B002MFULQO|5.0|I am so glad that the documents are being declassified finally and we can see the truth of this assassination. I hope you will make another movie, with more of the facts that are coming out, or even a series so that the younger people can see what really went on.
B004SBX112|5.0|I have so much fun playing the Angry Birds Seasons and all the Angry Bird games by Rovio, purchased at Amazon Apps.  Hours of fun are always included.
B009178OQA|5.0|i think this is a great movie to watch if you need some inspiration or you are doing some soul searching in life.  what jiro says in the opening just about sums it all up.  he is good at what he does because he is in love with it. i forget the other quote from the fish monger in the purple vest, but, he says some very meaningful things as well. i know that is vague, i plan to watch this again. very powerful.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great read! Seen thru the eyes of characters that keeps one at the edge of their seat! What will happen when this event does happen in real life!?
006202406X|4.0|I can't believe so many people are hating on this book. My main criticism would be that the first half was slow. Otherwise, it picked up in the second half and I couldn't put it down. I loved that Roth switched points of view between Tris and Tobias. It was helpful to get into each of their heads. And I loved how it ended. I love that Roth was brave enough to tell the real story, and not the fake fairy tale people wanted. It's a tale about war and children. War + children = not-such-a-Cinderella-ending. I thought it was beautifully done. Bravo, Ms. Roth, for being brave... and dauntless!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is awesome. Has so many armies. Also lots of armor but I could turn it in to a five star game. Very cool game get it.
B008Y7J91M|2.0|Boring.  You could guess the end within the first 15 minutes of the movie.  Same old . .  Well I won't tell you in case you plan on watching it.  Seems to me that there are many more good movies out there worth watching.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is a awsome game i love it.  it is so awsome i will play it everyday  on my kindle fire
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Tried to watch on tivo amazon instant video.  2 hours of downloading and still would not start.  Do not use tivo amazon instant video
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love the graphics and game play but both times I tried to buy crowns in the game it glitched. I was charged both times but did not get any of the crowns I bought. Luckily the wonderful customer service of Amazon reimbursed me the money from the first purchase and after sending a screenshot of my receipt Zynga finally gave me the crowns I bought. I would have given it five stars had this problem not happened twice in a row (or at all). I just hope this never happens again or I will just have to stop paying real money when I play entirely.
B000KJU182|5.0|Fine print of this marvelous Ustinov adaptation of a gripping Melville novella of great moral concern: with evil and especially with the death penalty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm always getting bored of the same old games I play every day this game is not like that. This game has NOTHING WRONG WITH IT, it's all GOOD, BEST GAME EVER and I'm NOT KIDDING I'M ALMOST 13 so BELIVE ME
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|More action in this movie than the whole of WW II. Loved it. Heroes were fun and full of surprizes.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The best show on TV is now available in a Meth barrel with a Pollos Hermanos Apron and a pog slammer.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Just outstanding. The story is clear, the actors are giving it their all, and the action is just great. Jennifer Lawrence made everything feel real.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game, but my friend has it on Xbox, and she can actually spawn creepers. I mean, we can't even go to the nether, OR have dogs/cats. Like I said, I love the game, but need that update.<br /><br />  Thanks!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great action. I love the pure good and evil of the story. A repeat watch will be necessary because I might have missed something.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Loved it!!  Once again Grisham delivers.  Well written and slow to deliver his secrets.  Sycamore Row will not disappoint new or established readers.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great action and suspense. You sit at the edge of your seat throughout the film. Acting was just fantastic. What a great story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just loved! Loved the end, how things turned out not being perfect but honest the way I thought would be.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was pretty good.Hated that everything always happens to Tris. You can almost predict what is going to happen though.
0553801473|4.0|Please stay alive long enough to finish the series, George RR Martin!!!  I want more main characters to die lol
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was pretty good. Better than the movie of course, but who really cares. You can almost predict what is going to happen though.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Some really gaping plot holes does not stop this movie from being enjoyable.  I sincerely hope they make a sequel.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It was pretty good. Better than the movie of course, but who really cares. You can almost predict what is going to happen though.
B00009YXHN|4.0|I actually like the 3rd movie better (Beyond Re-Animator), but this one's pretty good.  I hope Stuart Gordon finally gets around to making a 4th one.
B00EPH8SBM|1.0|The movie did not convey what the play did, especially the comedic aspect.  Very disappointing for such a wonderful story.
B00AG297GK|1.0|I liked Borat. I don't think I laughed once in 83 minutes. Not funny, just stupid cliches, with a few irrelevant turds thrown in. Disappointing movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Sometimes the puzzle rotates off the screen and you can only get it back by restarting the game. You lose all of your progress. If they fix that it is a 5 star game
B004UID2LC|5.0|Both myself and my. Husband have enjoyed hours of entertainment using this application.  Great for any tablet. Really reliable.  Thank you.
B00CCEHR80|4.0|Best of the Garcia Live releases so far.  We can only hope they stay on this tack with lots of exciting tracks from good to great shows.
B0084AYLK8|2.0|A significant portion of Chapter 20 is missing in the version that I downloaded; the missing section is significant in terms of plot, as well as being quite large (the majority of the chapter).
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|My favorite detective, Agent Pendergast, once again proved his mental acuity. I LOVED THIS STORY! I have been a Corrie Swanson fan since \\"Still Life With Crows\\", and greatly enjoyed her adventures as well. Delightful read, more please!
B005MRXS78|4.0|Is working fine, people comments that it was not good, so far I put my Sony VR3000 and it pan and tilt smoothly.
1608955702|4.0|I learned quite a bit of lighting from this book. Two of the biggest were actually understanding how guide numbers work which I've never seen explained as well as it was in this book. The second is how they put in a ton of sample images showing how just a slight change in photographer or subject can take an image from blah to outstanding and with very simple lighting set ups as well. Happy I received this book to review if only for learning guide numbers.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|We'll written, Stephen King has improved with age and really enjoying his last few books and looking forward to future books.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun cute and so far easy game<br />Something I can play just to relax or with my son<br />Fun fun fun
1401227821|5.0|Adam Hughes never disappoints. This book captures his early work to some of his more recent work and you can literally see his growth as an artist the further you get into the book. I love reading how an artist came up with a concept or how the piece was created and in this book you get a nice description to go along with the artwork from the artist himself.
B0091VYG86|4.0|Fun Movie.  Loved Pleasantville and glad you give us great movies on PRIME.  Only wish is that once on PRIME stays on prime instead of only for a limited amount of time but I understand you have to rotate them in order to give us new ones also.  I am amazed if I have not been on my ROKU to pull up Amazon Prime for a few weeks how many new movies you have posted since the last time.  Way to go Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the first game I have ever played. I thought they were a stupid waste of time. I have always blocked all games from showing up on my Facebook wall. Never played Farmville, Words with Friends, etc. For some reason, this game caught my attention &amp; I had to see what all the hype was about. I am now addicted!! Love the challenge! How long till you get Pet Rescue for Kindle?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Hate the death but love the entire series. All good things must come to an end, right! Still love the writer just not sure why it ended this way.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Beautiful voices alone and together.  In person is the best way to enjoy them but this is great if one cannot see them live.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Fantastic writing, fun to read. I love when I feel like the characters become my people. I enjoy the way Lauren writes and have gone on to read her other books as well.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Wasted purchase.  I usually like her humor but it doesn't translate well in written form. Like her much better on tv.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is fun helps pass the time. Wish I could move things around more though kinda make it my own.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Great read..70 pages to go.  Interesting fast paced plot twist and turns.  Hard to put down.  At 771 pages a hefty book, perfect for my Kindle.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I'v's been playing game for a year now off an on. I really do enjoy it..it should have the option of using pearls or sand dollars to purchase the treasure chests.I'm at level 37 an gill has not shown up yet. But for what it is it is a great game.To be able to hear the voices of the characters would be pretty cool.And yes I do spend some real money,but it is something I enjoy playing.I've not had any trouble with app. I purchased a new kindle fire hdx from a first generation kindle an Disney transferred my account no problem.
B001AH6ZWY|2.0|The movie is a blatant religious film. The original plot is interesting while the acting and central theme are pointless and boring. You won't really get any deep messages from this film.<br /><br />I haven't read the book, but from the description it is much better than this film.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|When I updated the app, I found a problem.  Zoe was telling me about the dream set when the arrow pointed at nothing and none of the buttons worked. Then when I managed to get out, I couldn't be able to complete the quest, therefore not  able to complete another quest.
B00EPFEY44|1.0|The sound is terrible.  Three is so much background noise that you can barely hear Mr.Bocelli singing. Also, it's only part of the concert. I was very disappointed to say the least.  That is the way both the CD and DVD  is.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is a must read if you are interested in your health and not totally brainwashed from sitting under the food pyramid.  Science, not speculation, is used to sort out the failure of our standard western diet.  Every health problem I have is attributable to the inclusion of modern, GMO wheat in most of our foodstuffs.  It's hard news to take, but there's a bright side.  Once you adjust to wheatless, you are no longer witless, no longer hungry all the time, no longer scratching the ecsema, no longer haunted by depression or crankiness, no longer borderline diabetic.  It's not all deprivation, either.  I just made a fabulous low-sugar pumpkin pie with ground walnut crust for Thanksgiving and enjoyed it with no resulting heartburn or gut distress!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting and frustrating!  Great game, fun way to pass time (especially on a slow day @ work.  Just when you thing you've got it solved, it tricks yahoo!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Would recommend to anyone who asked.  I meshed great with the shining. I liked rose the hat.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|While I enjoyed the book,I didn't feel that there was anything that was particularly new or insightful about Aslan's take on the &#34;Historical Jesus.&#34;  The book relied on selectively choosing which parts of the 'new' and 'old' testaments that 'truth' and which ones were 'clear fabrications.'  I understand the need to make such decisions in order to form a coherent story, but I found the method to be a little jarring.  I also found some of the arguments to be a little hollow with respect to the temple leaders.  The modern day equivalent would be to paint all pastors or religious leaders with the same brush that one would use to paint notorious televangelist.  While I'm sure there were some clear examples of excess, I am also sure that there were some devout leaders who followed the torah &#34;correctly.&#34;<br /><br />I think my biggest problem with the book was that while the author goes to great lengths to show how the Historical Jesus was part of a larger movement and was part of a revolutionary time, there is no cogent argument for why all the other zealots have been forgotten to time with the exception of John the Baptist and Jesus.  To compare Jesus with all of his (forgotten) contemporaries and not try to explain why he is remembered and they are not was disappointing to me.  To me, that was the most disappointing part of the book and why I walk away with an overall dissatisfied impression of the book.  If Jesus was one of a 100 (or 1000) other people who were crucified for sedition why is he still relevant enough to write a book about today?
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish u can  download mods because I really like pixlemon and Tnt mod so I wish they update that
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Interesting story with well developed characters and settings but the main character's voice is laborious. The author seems obsessed with painting a detailed vision of each  scene's images, feelings, reference points from a character's past, smells, tastes and air texture.<br /><br /> Found myself feeling frustrated at the pace or skipping lots of passages.<br /><br />There's a lot of story within a story with many characters painstakingly relaying stories to explain plot developments.<br /><br />Overall like it but would like it better about 150 pages shorter.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I can not connect with my friends on this game.I really want too connect with my friends.please fix thank you.
B008ULRY78|5.0|Must love gore & badass fight scenes, but also - pretty damn good character development. Probably my favorite movie of 2011!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I would have rated it five, however I was disappointed that they wrote off two main characters in one season.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I'd like to say I hated this movie - that as a grown woman I found it trite. However, it won me over. Is it silly and a bit immature and totally predictable? Yes. But it's still adorable and my 10 year old daughter loved it. (The language is a bit much for a 10 year old - but I don't mind that as much as when movies have overt sexuality and this has nothing but a kiss)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome because it is like you can operate the robot how you want.Plus you think it is awesome to.<br /><br />  THE END
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book was much less interesting that the first two. I breezed through book one and two and struggled to finish this one. As usual, the third in the series was a bit of a disappointment.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This one really makes you think.  Perfect for those days when you need to get the brain cell juices flowing
006202406X|1.0|I was so furious with the end of this book, I didn't even finish it. It made me feel like reading and loving this series was a waste of time. Roth slaps her fans in the face with such a cold move. I also think she doomed the movie Divergent to fail. I was so excited to see her story come to life, but I'll avoid it now that I know what comes in Allegiant.<br /><br />While I don't necessarily recommend readers avoid this book, don't spend money on it. Let Roth know there are consequences for making poor, selfish plot choices.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|This game is awesome! You get to defeat beasts and monsters with a growing army! And even though I haven't played it for long, it.... is...... AWESOME!!!! Just try it out for yourself.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Second in the &#34;new&#34; series.  Will have to wait until another movie comes out that has a different feel.  ha
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've never used this as a backpack.<br /><br />I got this to store and transport camera gear. I already have lots of camera bags, but wanted something a little larger. Most of my lenses and camera bodies are stored on shevles at home, but during a long distance move, this bag came in handy to transport and protect several my extra lenses.<br /><br />For the price, this is a bargain. I have a couple of LowePro backpacks, one of which is about the same size as this Amazon one. Back in the mid- to late-90s, I paid over a hundred bucks for it!!! Well, I guess we can thank China's emergence as America's manufacturing centre for lower cost products. LOL.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Quality science fiction movie.  It was over too quickly.  made me watch it again.  I enjoyed it both times.  Thank you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simply a stellar dramatic series.  Downton Abbey is a diverse character drama that just gets better and better.  It's worth your time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's better than the hidden object games on Facebook.  I'm completely addicted. I could play this game for hours. It's well worth the money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely addictive. Progressively challenging puzzles with very cute graphics. Intense enough that you don't get bored. I would highly recommend this if you need to pass time waiting for an appointment or on a long flight.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|I was surprised at how well this works. Have to pay to see the future, however if you meditate, let your subconscious guide your hand you get answers..maybe not the ones you want to hear. But answers.
B0055B7K7A|4.0|A little slow moving, but entertaining. A few iconic moments and one-liners that you will repeat later. Enjoyable and wholesome.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app you should get it! And it will upgrade by it's self! I it so fun get it plz!
B0090EKRKU|3.0|Kinda slow moving and unsatisfying for an adult audience. The kids might like it more.  I just couldn't get into it. Sorry.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I found her books as a fluke after reading the Hunger Games. I was already in the mindset for this kind of story but was enthralled by how REAL she presented her characters and her breakdown of human imperfection in the factions. I had never read a book quite like this and I have enjoyed every minute of them. I hope she continues with her unique writing style--- I look forward to reading many more by her!!!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|It definitely entertains.  Cute. Gets the job done. On my list of favorties.  Very clever spoof on the whole &#34;Star Trek&#34; thing.  Trekkies should really love it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent series about World War II buddies. Some strong language and one shot of nude woman lovemaking. Not quite the same as the book.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It's a cable.  What can you say? It is what it is. Decent quality. Gets the job done. Good price.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I thought Ms. Gabaldon could not keep coming up with more adventures...but she has!  Can't wait to read the rest...
B0083B3KOQ|2.0|I never could actually get this to perform the file conversions for which I loaded it.  Maybe it was me, but I do a lot on computers and tablets.  Perhaps its not user-friendly enough??  Oh well.  Sorry.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Enchanting, Sublime, Perfect. Give this album to everyone you know this holiday season. Recorded flawlessly, play it on good speakers in a quiet room.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is my main reader. Easy to navigate with all the basic features you need and some neat additional ones. Highlighting, freehand drawing and text annotations are useful and easy to use. File mangement is intuitive and helpful. It is my most vaualbe Kindle app.
B008PZZFHA|2.0|I knew it would be toilet humor before I watched it, but it was worse than I thought!  UGGGHHHH!  This will never become a classic.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This one works well.  It is a great utility app to have on board for file management.  It's not as easy and functional as having a computer to connect to via USB, but it is an effective &#34;second best&#34;.
B008602KQI|5.0|Exciting and fun movie!  Loved the characters and the story line.  Can't wait for the sequel.  Don't miss this one.
1250038820|4.0|A great read. Brandon Statton gets criticized for his photo work, but he's doing something right if he's gotten this far. Yes, some of the photos aren't too great, and some of the photos seem to be included merely for the fashion of the individual, but most portraits stop and make you think about the strangers on the streets of NY.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A beautifully conceived story and eloquently written. Unfortunately, the author struggles to bring the story to an end. It's good, but could have been great, if the ending had been shorter and tighter.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|Awesome soundtrack to an awesome movie! No complaints.<br />It is stuffed with extra tracks and alternate versions of the main scores.
0385537131|5.0|This one is one of the good Grisham books.  I have read all of his books and, of course, liked some better than others.  But this one is right up there along with The Firm, a The Pelican Brief, and The Rainmaker.
B00AG475K8|5.0|Best of the John Hughes movies! Have seen this several times and am thrilled to own it. Soundtrack is awesome as well.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Hate it.. Never works. I think this piece is defective.. Brings down internet at home..  Never worked, my other wireless streaming devices work like charm.. so the issue is not my wireless etc, the issue is with this device.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Love all things Doctor.  Delve deeper in to better effects and cheesier plot.  Still makes me cry, even to this day.
0316069434|4.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints. Harry Bosch remains one of my favorite characters -- smart, intuitive, compassionate yet tough. As he works his way through the clues in a 20 year old cold case that started in the L. A. Riots, he puts pieces of the puzzle together and carries the reader along for the ride. The title pertains to both a 'black box' card index file kept by a fellow investigator, and also Harry's search for the moment (in airplane and other accidents) when the 'black box' is discovered and typically explains the reasons for the crash. The ending of the book is rather too pat -- like &#34;why was she there at the right moment&#34; and &#34;how did he know that would happen'. Otherwise it's a fun read and an afternoon of reading well spent.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|A really fast paced mystery with lots of twists. The depiction of soviet Russia is chilling. Looking forward to the other books.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|this was a good movie. the suspense was great. can't tell the movie though. just watch it. no problems. good movie
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This was such a good movie. It's sub-titled but not fast, you can easily follow. The movie takes place in East Berlin before the fall of the wall in the final throws of the communist regime. It follows the lives of a playwright, an up and coming stage actress and a man who has been a product of communism. All 3 of these main characters go through a transformation and the results become a metamorphosis for them. It shows what too much government can leak into a life and the dangers that occur.
B00G9TR60I|4.0|A great love story. I saw it a long time ago and I loved it them. How was the time to own it. Holly is great. So is John.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|...awesome I am having a blast with this game. Great to play when you only have a little time to kill
0380789035|5.0|Great read.  Very well written with believable characters and unexpected plot twists.  I've read a lot of this sort of thing, but there really isn't anything quite like this sort of thing
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product has great features and is comparable with the apple tv.  The price is definitely competitive at 35 dollars!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is amazing it feels like you are really into it and the war AMAZING!!!! I woke recommend this app to anyone with the extra money!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I enjoy mystery and also this game has a challange in some of the phases of the game. Looking forward the the next challanging game.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|After reading Tuesdays with Morrie and Have a Little Faith, felt disappointed.  Perhaps this fable was just too unbelievable.  Everyone you write about in your nonfiction are people I would want to invite over for a cup of tea around the kitchen table.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This version of Planet of the Apes brought the story into the current century. The special effects were very good. I loved it and can't wait for the sequel.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This will change completely the way you view life and death.  I've read a lot about reincarnation, and reincarnated lives, but never the extent that goes on &#34;in between.&#34;  Highly recommended reading. I'm going to be buying the rest of his books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is an ok app, doesn't have as close to as many features as pc but we all knew that so it doesn't really matter. My main gripe with this is you can't play multiplayer with 2 second gen kindles. My friend algae an iPhone and we can play together, but one of my other friends with the same kindle fire as me cant connect to the servers made. The funniest part is that I can't connect to multiplayer servers I make either. So if u want to play multiplayer, just play with some who doesn't have a kindle.
1592402690|5.0|this book told me a lot of what transpired in the studio and how they came up with many effects.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|great stars. good plot, keeps you actively engaged so you can't forget it. I think about it all the time.
B008EKOIN8|3.0|Some interesting insights on things like the role of cooking techniques in the development of society. Mostly, however, it's just too self-indulgent and long. Needed a ruthless editor.
B00992CF6W|4.0|please 4j studio's please put a mo creatures mods. And I am tired of waging for new updates 0.7.0 came out a long time ago make a new updates. like put in saddels and put in horses. and jungle booms and one more thing. put<br /> villages too becaues their are blacksmiths. buttsagington out
B0081336FO|5.0|Brilliant modern re-imagining of Conan Doyle's Holmes and Watson, with ever-so-clever twists on the original plots and their titles. Superb!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This series of books is the most poorly written material I've ever read.  It's entertaining though for what it is...and by now everyone knows what it is, and certainly a fast read.  You gotta read it just to say you did ;)
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good but not as good as I'd hoped. Washington is as watchable as ever, but it sometimes comes across as a grandstanding opportunity for that actor.
B008MM9630|4.0|I really like this game. it is a cute game for people of any age. I love it and so does my 7 year old.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I rate Dragon Story 5 stars because I have gotten other people addicted, just like me! It is really fun. I like it because there are many types of dragons that each have their own profile to read about them, which is my favorite part. For example, Fruitful dragons love giving, and Air dragons&acute; profile talks about air dragons controlling their famous winds. Most of the dragons cost gold, but water, air, fire, and forest cost D.S. coins, which are easier to obtain than gold is. You  can use the basic dragons to breed dragon hybrids, and you can buy habitats with coins, or upgraded habitats with gold. You can breed and evolve dragons that are composed of the types Mythic, Fire, Water, Forest, Rainbow, Royal, Magic, Light, Night, Tropic, Stone, Metal, Air, Gemstone, and Diamond. Many of these types are obtainable by spending gold but a few are not. Any dragon you can purchase with gold can also be bred. My favorite dragon is my Diamond dragon because that is the rarest dragon type, even though hybrids are more rare. I think Dragon Story is  one of the best free games in the Kindle Fire app store.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|This is a very interesting set.  Not only was it remastered for a much crisper picture than the original series ever had they also enhanced it with some modern CG.  Personally I feel that the modern CG was very well done and does not detract from the original series, rather it is going with what the original creators would have done if they had had the technology and budget to do so.  My father who has enjoyed Star Trek since it aired for the first time also agreed with my opinion on this.  Still, knowing how precious the original series is to many Trekkies I know that many of them will not enjoy that it has been &#34;tampered&#34; with.  So, if you're a purist about Star Trek than this is probably not for you.  But if you're not, this is kind of nice, although nothing is not done subtly in terms of added modern CG effects.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing love it highly recommended for kids and adults alike. frustrating sometimes but always fun to play
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I have friends who absolutely swear by Evernote.  They always cite how much they love how it crosses over well from all of their devices.  Personally I much prefer Color Note.  Maybe this is because I only ever used it on my Kindle Fire, but I just don't get why they all like it so much.  It seems pretty average for this type of app.
B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|This was the worst book I have read in a while.  I was so very disappointed in Preston and Child.  All the other Pendergast novels have been riveting and this one is apparently written for young people ... but when I say that I realize that I am disparaging young people in a way that I don't really see them or believe.  The characters in this book are shallow.  The young girl (20 year old) acts like a two year old having fits and is not at all the type of person that would be associated with Pendergast.  What happened to Pendergast's ward that had supposedly tossed her baby off the ship?  What happened to that story line?  A better question is what happened to these authors?  Did they misuse their finances in such a bad way that they had to churn out this rubbish to make a dollar?  I will never just automatically buy one of their books again without &#34;trying&#34; it first ... which I did this time and every other time a new book has appeared in the past.  Shame on Preston and Child!
B000URWYTS|4.0|A good novel.  The author understands the historical setting and creates her story within that context.  Enjoyable fiction that appreciates history.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|It was a little too wordy and the choice of words were not always readily available even in the Kindle dictionary.
B009ME47H2|4.0|Works well on Kindle Fire HD, but would be better with a little more microphone gain. Recording volume is low when recording teacher lectures and I sit on front row. I also have not found a way to move the recording from the Kindle Fire HD to my computer yet. There may not be a way.
B00846REIS|5.0|very exciting,easy read. wonderful characters and story line<br /> Highly recommended for others to read. can't wait for next one to read
B00F88U4J6|1.0|Moon+ Reader will not open on Kindle Fire HD. It may be a great program for other Kindles, but not the HD.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|My son's favorite show. He loves the characters and the songs. It has a good message about moderation. Just a really fun movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and pretty easy to play. Only thing that stinks is having to wait for energy to refill. But fun anyway.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|insightfull topics that helps on understanding issues on life. I keep watching it all the time and I do recommend for those curious about way things happen.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I can't remember the last time when I was so fascinated by a book. This is one of those novels that you simply can't stop reading.<br /><br />I even woke up a couple hours early to finish it!!<br /><br />If you like the shining or even if you don't know what the shining is you will enjoy this novel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. Great love story and a great story about death. Would recommend to everyone especially those who are fighting cancer or have a loved one who is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite pass times. This game may look BORING but this is the most addicting games I've ever played.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The whole series is great and really interesting-I really love the story builds up during the three books and turns into a huge rebellion
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent, gripping book. Enjoyed it more and more as it progressed. I just wanted it to go on and on. A true John Grisham.
0743270754|5.0|Ms. Goodwin does it again.  She brings historical figures to life and presents history in a highly readable fashion.  For those interest in an important historical era, pick it up and read it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Simply  the best game I have played on my Kindle!  I truly wish it would never end. Great puzzles that were not completely impossible, but tough enough to make you very satisfied and delighted with yourself when you figure them out.  I also liked not having to jump around a lot of locations trying to find items to use in other locations.  It's all right before you - leaving your brain free to focus on the puzzle at hand.  I hope to see many more games of this genre.  I am a huge Must fan and this ideed does compare!
0316055433|3.0|I am aware of the positive reviews the book has received from a variety of reviewers.  However, it is seldom, after reading a book that I have the sense I have just wasted my time.  The book is overly long.  The characters demand no sympathy for their problems--most of which they bring to themselves.  The principle character, for whom we seem expected to hold great sympathy because he lost his mother tragically when he was quite young, and that sympathy is supposed to last well into a troubled adulthood is not sympathetic.  The main character strikes one as quite stupid for being unable to solve the simplest of problems, that is, returning a painting to a museum.<br /> I would not recommend spending the time to read an inconsequential book with no point to it.  But, if you enjoy drugs, alcohol, thievery, and nonsensical violence, by all means waste a few hours of your time.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|My favorite of Austen's books.  The characters are believable and more realistically portrayed than in some other films.  I was disappointed that so much of the story was left out of the movie though.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham rarely disappoints and this one was really a good story...I'm sure the movie won't be long in coming, it's the type that lends itself very well to the screen.  Easy to read.  I'm happy.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|good reading<br /><br />very good but very much like all his books, easy reading.  do recommend it.  good lawyers book for all
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a movie that you will watch time and time again.  For anyone that is from the Vietnam era it will bring back memories and the music is awesome.  Great talent, loved this movie.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|In the booklet the Pilot does not have an Episode number but it is actually Episode 1 - renumbering the remaining episodes in  chronological order gives you a total of  7 Episodes - otherwise the set is awesome -  this comment, of course concerns the  first  season -
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! Its fun to collect animals and decorate your village. Also Scrat is the funniest when hes fighting off those pirana fish.
0385528787|5.0|amazing last book to atwood's trilogy. answered many questions we had about the game, the pills, zeb, adam one, the pigoons, the crakers, and it was nice to see the &#34;long term&#34; run of the group living in a post-apoc world. no spoilers, but the ending is satisfying but still allows you to wonder just enough. jimmy is especially odd in this book but that's to be expected. all your favorite characters from the other books - that had survived - are back.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|love this game it's worth getting and  AMAZING  it has amazing guns and misson.  it gots assault rifles  shotguns pistols
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Great movie, one of the only Japanamation movies i've seen and liked a lot, Hence why I bought it, its only took years to write a review.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The movies and TV show are great, but the book is even better.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a wonderful book when he penned Sherlock Holmes.
B002N44XSG|4.0|This is a good book. I enjoy how there are several short stories in one. I recommend this book for children interested Greek mythology but still  want a sort of easy, quick read.
B00D2ZF24O|2.0|Didn't like the movie.  I bought the movie more for Will Smith than his son -- bad mistake on my part.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I related very strongly with this book. I too lost a beautiful daughter and the writers exceptional understanding of gut wrenching grief and behaviors astounded me.<br /><br />I loved this book and I can't wait to download the next.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Loved the movie.  It had a lot of twists and turns along with a bit of comedy.  Bought it on the recommendation of another person.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|Incredible story.  This book was referred to in &#34;The Thirteenth Tale&#34; and I read it out of couriousity.  Sure glad I did....great story.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and now my kids love watching it. This is no Technicolor candyland, this is Baum's books come to life. My children love it as much as I did.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|This version is heart just like pc and xbox version but my only complaint is that it needs more multiplayer
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is very addicting fun game to play.  I wish that it wold give you more than 5 chances to play before you have to wait for new life.  why not think about changing this feature in the game; I believe lots of people would like that.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|this is a great live album plus you get a dvd with a lot of special features plus you get to see Lzzy peform live.

B00BGV0Y26|5.0|a great second album by one of the best up & coming bands around today Lzzy Hale has one of the best voices ever
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|this is a great game....not just ur run of the mill flash game but a true battle with evil I recommend you get. this game now...........
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Love  this game!<br />I love the graphics. It's better than the rebar frontline commando<br />U have to download this game now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not so fun and I don't get why my friends like it. It is so boring and I once fell asleep
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This was such a boring book  people should get interest in this kind of book. Who would read this kind of book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this app for how well it works. if I uninstall something it makes sure that the folders from that app are not left behind cluttering up, and taking up space. the memory booster is pretty good too. I use this constantly om my kindle fire
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I get what I need whenever I cannot find it somewhere else from Amazon. So now I just go to Amazon first. Usually that is where I will find what I am looking for and at a great price.
0670014893|3.0|I had the pleasure to consume A Delicate Truth in audio CD format read by John Le Carre himself. He is as masterful a reader as he is a writer. His command of the different accents of the characters and their personalities greatly enhanced the overall experience. His writing is nothing but excellent, with superb dialogue that perfectly informs the reader of their personalities.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. The underlying premise of the plot is that uncovering and exposing the truth behind Wildlife would drive the protagonist, Toby Bell, and the supporting characters to take big risks to their careers and lives is simply not believable. They are long-serving professionals in the diplomatic corps and undoubtedly highly familiar already with the accompanying cynicism, hypocrisy and expediency that is standard operating procedure.<br /><br />I actually think this novel would be far better as a comedy of manners with homage to Oscar Wilde and with a simple change to the outcome of Wildlife. You have the bumbling self-important bureaucrat, Kit Probyn, the arrogant but stupid minister, the secret admiring boss, a love interest, and of course, the main character,Toby, who is befuddled from his various conflicting loyalties. These comments won’t make sense until you’ve read the novel, so I’d be interested in your post-reading comments.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|think it is a fun game based off of a great movie making it a  great product to add to that I think the game has a different perspective of the movie and masks everyone like the movie more because of the different angles of perspective
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Love all Michael Connolly books.  superior writing, keep them coming, Love, love love, this book and Harry Bosch.  Great! Great!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Finally this is on the kindle fire. It's an alright game. It's fun but for the unlocks you need to hang the console game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun stuff<br />Hope you enjoy as well. Lots of projects to keep you busy. Side games are fun too. Enjoy!!!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Great game with a dynamic story, well thought out hero system, and a fun collection of new troops, towers, enemies, and graphics!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The film is interesting, but I felt the story telling was weak.  There were several plot points in the film that could have been better developed to make the film have a strong impact.  As it stands, I find it an average action/sci fi film, despite having some good acting talent on the cast they were not able to pull this film out of a middling rating.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really love this game. It's fun and I really enjoy it. When I have free time this is always the game I go to.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Not loud enough for me. I used it once and never did again. Maybe I need to give it another try, but my dogs do a better job at waking me in the morning....lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story to get your mind off. There is love, hope ,family,friends ,hate, action, skills, drama, fantasy and much more!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|really haven't used this much. Honestly don't know why, just haven't. should go back and check it out there maybe games on there that I just didn't see,
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It doesn't play anything and won't show up when I watch a video!So annoying. All that it says is &quot;vtube is bot responding&quot;
B00FN811SY|5.0|Outstanding product, easy to use and to follow.  I love reading the bible using this library.  Could not ask for anything better than this.  Jehovah always gives us what we need at the proper time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thinks it's a cool game downloaded it to my phone and my tablet so now I can try and beat my records
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Probably the best series ever on TV. Great stories, acting and an ending that didn't disappoint (unlike Dexter's bummer cop out). Worst thing was having to iron the apron before using!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A most difficult book to put down, and yet one must eventually come to the last word.  What a writer!  Characters that bleed reality, introspection that sings.  Ahhhh....
B003WUYRGI|4.0|The only thing that time of a good time of the one that I have been in a half years ago when I have to
B00F91SCXC|1.0|This movie was like watching someone play a repetitive kill-a-zombie video game. The plot was see-through and throw-away -- essentially just a thin excuse to jump from location to location and come up with new ways to kill more zombies. Just awful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app its great I play it all the time everywhere I go I highly reccomend this app
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I really liked this movie, and I'm not typically a fan of Superman. Given this, it may be that fans that prefer the extra-perfect-all-american-boyscout version of past movies, and cartoons (I haven't read most of his comics to compare) could be disappointed with the characterization of their hero; it's just slightly grittier.<br /><br />I also love the characterization of Lois Lane, and I hope others appreciate this version, who's very convincing as someone who would be a successful investigative journalist.<br /><br />The effects are right up there with contemporary blockbuster movies, though I'm almost feeling urban/skyscraper destruction is getting cliche after this and other recent movies, like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and Avengers.<br /><br />The splicing of flashback into ongoing action took some getting used to; and it seemed particularly heavy in the earlier parts of the movie, but I do believe it was an efficient way to get the background info necessary to empathize with the characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is a very fun game and I would recommend to anyone who loves to be challenged.  It is a great game and very addicting.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|the musical score on this was fantastic and I didn't even realize how significant a role in telling the store it was while I watch the movie in Dolby - later as I lay in bed and replayed the story and movie back in my head it struck me just how influential the score adds to the immersion and suspension of disbelief so to get deep into the stories emotional tensions.  I liked the characters a lot including the captain and eventually Noomi Rapace's character - thought the makeup job on the old man was atrocious.  Why didn't they just hire a real old actor? dumb!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I love Denzel Washington movies but was very disappointed in Flight. The trailer clips and TV ads gave you the impression that it is about an airplane crash.  Instead, it was about alcohol abuse.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The reel steel game is really good and is a really good kid and/or family game. It's good for kids who like to play really fun realistic game's
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I was certainly expecting more to this book then it delivered. If it was a movie or play I would have dosed off a few times as this book just had nothing to really offer.  The legal aspect / education just did not produce enough mental stimulation to make up for the dull plot and characters.<br /><br />I like JG but this was really dumbed down and boring.
B002VBV1S6|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Clever, engaging and now on my list of &#34; I have to read all this author's works&#34;.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love period pieces and the costuming is so authentic and beautiful.  It is always interesting to see a lifestyle<br />different from one's own and it hasn't been all that long ago.  But, it shows the rich have their own problems<br />too.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Movie didn't wow me; I expected more from our director. Re-upping a 'classic' you take that choice. Got to me safely and quickly.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|This movie is action-packed from just after the beginning to the end.  It reminded me of the Die Hard series.  Jamie<br />Foxx makes a good President and Channing Tatum is almost as good as Bruce Willis but needs some seasoning.<br />The daughter of Tatum's character was excellent and I hope to see her in other things.  I liked that there was a<br />touch of humor to it also.  A fun ride. A lot of violence in it, though, and not for young kids.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is not a pop album.  For hard, shock rap lovers it really does not get any better than this.  Eminem's history aside: the lyricism, funny puns, and emotional spirit in this album are amazing.<br /><br />Something tells me he's been building this album for ten years now.  Whenever he had an amazing line or verse, he'd say 'that's to good for the RE-UP' or something.  I feel like he was saving his best and most creative verses for this album.  Either that or he hired a giant group of writers; because there is surely no way we thought of all of them in one year by himself.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|If you like Zombie Movies and Apocalypse Movies then this is for you. A little quirky but aren't they all?? After all its &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|Fun for the whole family. My six year loves this movie and the Belt toy that came with it, too.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book can't wait to finish and start on the 3rd one in the series after it. Easy reading teen fiction.
B00GX59QO2|1.0|Don't waste your time and money. Cheap sequel to a surprisingly original movie. All the characters were majorly dumbed-down. The bad guys' dialogue was particularly awful and the whole thing was downright painful (or I should say the whole first third - I had to turn it off).
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good actors.  The scenery is great.  It is full of suspense.  To  me it is definitely not just a teen flick.
B003JCZLRS|5.0|Great 1st book for an excellent series. I read the Master and Commander novel in a month and got obsessed with the series, i ended up reading the rest of the books (21 in all) in less than a year. Highly recommended.
B0018STVHQ|5.0|The characters are fully developed.  You understand each characters motivation even if they sicken you.  It gives you another twist to this historical era.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite movies. I like it because it does such a nice hob of portraying the backstory with basically no words. It does have an upbeat ending and moves well. Children of all ages should love it. Watch it with someone you love.
B000K3M1VI|3.0|I didn't like the story.  You do not know Sophie's story until the end.  The book was much more interesting.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|There was such a beautiful, poetic flow to this book. It took me into the time period bringing it to life around me. Making me understand why those involved acted as they did. Greta is serious heroine who faces up to what is without a whiny poor me attitude that is is prevalent in many modern novels. I would compare it to the film, Life is Beautiful, not because they are the same, but both authors find goodness in times that are not good. Two thumbs up for The Luck of the Weissensteiners.
B00FW67GS6|5.0|Really good CD.  Glad I got it.  Love these guys together.  Good dance music.  If you like the blues, you'll like this CD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best minecraft for the kindle fire HD in my opion. It has times when it acts up, but a good restart thr tablet will do the trick. Once again YOUR  MONEY WILL NOT BE WASTED
B000FCKIFU|2.0|I'm still struggling to finish this. I like everything Baldacci writes, even liked the first Camel Club I read, but this...is the most boring, ludicrous thing I've read in a long time. I keep feeling he is praising radical Islam and trying to make me &#34;understand&#34; them. Maybe when I finally get to the end, it will make more sense, but this is the last Camel Club &#34;adventure&#34; I will waste money and time on. Nothing against my own gender, but it has a very feminine feel to the narrative and if Oliver Stone is such a bad a#$, why does he schlep around, all droopy and weird? Just not my cup of tea.  .
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|Uninstalled it right away.  It just was not easy or intuitive to use.  I'll try it again something in the future to see if they made it any better.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Amazing app~~the information is excellent, as is the display.  I like that it is somewhat interactive, you can go back in time as well as forward. Great price too!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|So far so good, overclocks easily, handles everything I throw at it, runs cool even under an intense gaming load.
B000GPIPSS|1.0|I received the wrong DVD.  I was supposed to receive Dracula , but I received Lady in White instead.  I sent the Lady in White DVD back ,and would like to receive the Dracula DVD.  The Bones bundle 1-7, and season 8 was very enjoyable.  I enjoyed watching the Bones season 1-8.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|vTube is difficult to operate on the Kindle Fire but if you don't have any other choice, I'd recommend this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it lets the kids mind wonder i love it......i hope we all get this app.j j ncncc s  nbnbncjbfjeufhrfgrvyebcjdjdjdjbdfhdudhfdj
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|If you like being creative, it's fun<br />Can get expansive if you buy crowns.  Wish the could be earned faster.  Can earn gold coins quickly.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|It was an enjoyable film. Glad I watched it. 4 stars only because 5 is for &#34;i will buy that so I can watch it over and over&#34; and this film is not in that category for me. Well worth watching though.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was actually a very goof book but (1) the teenagers were using words that teenagers wouldn't use. (2) the ending was very expected and stopped very abruptly.  But over all it was very good.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|We were disappointed in this movie.  We have loved every Pixar movie (Cars being one of our favorites) up until we saw this one.  Our kids found it boring.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is totally worth your money! This game is a good game that takes up your time. I am very happy with this game
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Definitely a page turner.  Reminds us that we all have secrets that are hard to share, but how liberating it can be once we finally do share or have them revealed for us.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is perfect to create a little distraction in your day. Each level is a puzzle to solve with either skill or luck
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game. Simple, graphics are good, and kids can play it too if you don't mind robot violence.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I love this app I us it weekly it has been a great tool to keep my Knott tight and function like I intended.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|The best classic sci fi movie many wonderful  actors and future movie built off it I love the background sets
B00AJHDUQA|5.0|Nothing but absurd fun and silliness....with a touch of horror and sci-fi as well, this movie entertains me everytime I see it.  Wished some distributor would pick up the sequel to this one according to Wikipedia, would love to see more KILLER KLOWNS!!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This is another great novel in the cousin's series. Very enjoyable. I love how each noble in the series tells the same time period but from different perspectives.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Works as expected.  Nice power indicator (blue bar) makes it easy to find in the dark.  Should come with a longer cord like a 1 meter cord.  1ft. is quite short.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The writing was really good. The cast still fresh. Mark Harmon still good looking. Miss Sasha Alexander a lot though.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Entertaining and a different kind of context, but not really exceptional. Jennifer Lawrence was very good. I didn't read the books but the content seemed sparse.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|This is one of the best books I read in last time. Even if the heroine is not og the people I could like - because she is like a piece of wood, just drifting with the flow, but HOW it's written! So realistic, so exact in every detail! I don't like Hannah, I don't commiserate with her, but I love the book for incredible bright picture of what a person without life spark or will for struggle for herself can be like. But it's not only this. The book teaches us responsibility and compassion. Sorry, if I exprress myself clumsy, but I read better than I write or speak
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device, hbo go just came to it, much cheaper than the Apple TV. I like how I can stream from the Chrome web browser. If you have Google Chrome open, all you need to do is press Ctrl + O, and you can open any file in the web browser.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Part 3 wraps everything up nicely. Whereas Hangover 2 just used the same formula and did it again in Bangkok, Hangover 3 takes elements from the formula and goes a different direction. There is no waking up after a crazy party. In the end it comes together nicely. It isn't absolutely hilarious, but a good fun watch.
B008QOH1NG|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my son.  He loves this group.  Stryker was one of the first Christian groups that I introduced him to.  He will love this dvd.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Couldn't make sense of it  ,much too hard to understand how to play it ,didn't enjoy it at all ,no fun
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Saw this as a young girl.  I love this movie.  I sing all the songs and appreciate all the costumes.  It is a great movie!
0525951652|5.0|It describes and follows so closely the history of that period, and incorporates the characters as if they were really telling the story.It also provided me some additional insights to historical events I had not discovered before.  It is a book one finds hard to put down until the very end. Cannot wait for &#34;Edge of Eternity&#34; to be released in hardback
B007SYWFRM|4.0|A good game you can always check back to. I also like that this game is based off of the movie.
0156012197|5.0|for adults and children. It is a must read book for all! There are lessons to be learned in all walks of life!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Good, I guess, but needs work. At first I loved it, then it got boring. For one,there's no levels!!! Quests suck, they are too hard to do. I do like the animals but the newest update needs a &quot;how to&quot;guide. Bad and good. Get it, if you don't like it, get rid of it. By Faye Girl
B000002BE9|5.0|Always looking for her music! Its a trat to my ears and soul. As long as she makes music I will buy it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this game, but if you live in a place without wireless network, it sucks. And once you start the game,it gets realllllly addictive. However, I really like it,too. It's fun,and both me and my mom have it and like it a lot. You do have to buy pearls, though, if you want to actually get somewhere in the game. Otherwise it is a fantastic game.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Fiona<br />Apple is a great artist! I think that the front cover is kinda odd but her music is great!
B009178OQA|4.0|I go to Tokyo a lot and this was very interesting. Not sure if I would spend teh money to eat here!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love love love love love this music! I just want to listen to it all the time  Get it for some good music!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5 year old has fun playing it.  It has kept her entertained without needing to purchase any in-game upgrades.
B00DY76Z32|4.0|The movie was entertaining from beginning to end and had some good twists and turns.  The characters worked well together and banter was enjoyable.  Not the best SciFi action flick but worth the money.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing it in the theater. Was thrilled when Amazon had it on sale for $5!!! Touching, life affirming story of a callous, cynical gangsta and a parapalegic. I like that is is also based on a true-ish story. I think the movie would appeal to anyone with a heart.
1878424319|5.0|Great book that would benefit anyone!  Easy to read yet quite thought provoking. Thoroughly enjoyed and have given as a gift as well!  If applied, these four agreements will change your perspective on life in a very positive manner!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|In-line with the HBO series.  Recommended read the book;because of more stories about the characters.  Non stop pages of action
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my son and I have enjoyed this game very much I would like to see for the xbox or other consoles
140006922X|5.0|Gives a realistic view of the danger Jesus was constantly living.  People do not realize that being a messiah in those times was much more life-risking than being Mexican in Arizona or black in Mississippi.  Puts the Savior in context of his times, and gives an excellent over-all picture of the Holy Land.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Went to see this with my brother when it came out, I wasn't really expecting it to be a good movie but wow was I wrong. Guillermo Del Toro really knows how to direct an action-packed film! I can't wait for Pacific Rim 2 to come out, Del Toro already confirmed that a sequel was in the works!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Cud not put down. Lee Child is really superb story teller. Great Reading.Must read for the peoples interested in mystery and thrillers .
B008JFUNWS|1.0|It felt like I was watching a movie made for straight to DVD. It's a shame really, I enjoyed the books and I was looking forward to seeing the rest being made into films. The Lightning Thief may not have been as accurate as the book but it was definitely a lot better than Sea of Monsters. Just goes to show how important Chris Columbus was to the project as a director. I mean he did one hell of a job directing the first two Harry Potter films. Too bad he was only the producer in this one. Could've been WAY better.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Variety of puzzle games, which are nice but....<br /><br />No zoom feature, mission complete banner obnoxiously dances on screen, and last but not the least, in fact the worst is the dialogue, an average of 20 taps between scenes. One counted 53 and another over 60 taps, dialogue really isn't important and not worth reading.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author really made me feel the effort and the anxiety that each Seal<br />Goes through not only on each mission but on his overall life.<br />When the book was complete, I wanted to  give the Seals a standing<br />Ovation .<br />Anyone that is interested in the actual history of that moment must read<br />This book.<br />God bless ALL of the Special Forces of our military.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Would recommend it to everyone. Storyline compelling and filled with the usual intrigue. Cannot wait for the next pendergast novel.
B009NUV0E8|1.0|All of the Bonds got a lot of respect in remastering for Bluray. Except this one. What and the flying ****! This is one of the best Bond films ever made and it just gets crapped on. Not quite as bad as Predator: Ultimate Edition but getting close. I really have a hard time believing any story as to how this happened. Each and every other Bond film looks good to great to perfect. Why this one gets the ugly stick know one will ever know at this point but we can point to corporate greed first and foremost. I mean, it's like a friggin cable broadcast in HD at times. A few shots are decent and overall it is better than the DVD but don't buy this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to see what all the young people were reading,then an older gentleman highly recommended the Hunger. I loved the book even though it was not like any book I had read before.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy the stationary version but it`s all challenging. I recommend it if you love puzzles and want to challenge your brain.
B0007VNCQ6|5.0|This game is still very popular with the grandkids even after several years.  They love to get it out and play with it.  The little critters are all very cute and the game itself is fun for the little ones.  Even the teens like to play it.  It's sturdy and well made and will last for my grandchildrens children.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is good so far but just got through the tutorial!  I am hoping it is this good throughout the whole game.@
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this Castleville version. It's much better than the original version on Facebook. I really like playing this game and will continue too play.
0804161380|5.0|this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!
B00BMGUIJE|4.0|4.5 stars great addition to the collection. Not really sure where to put the poles to hold up the smoke but I guess just about anywhere is fine. Awesome pose, worth it.
B008FOB124|5.0|this cd is one of my fav DCD cd's now. if you havent bought this yet, do! you will not be disappointed
B00D3Y1C8Y|4.0|Just awesome. If you're a collector and love Zoro then it's hard to pass this one up because it's a much more interesting pose than the usual ones. Figuarts is great for the collectors who still like good quality but don't want to pay a extraordinary price. There are no extra detachable parts for this particular product though. Also, the plugs don't always fit or it won't bend to the right places (something I've noticed in my other figurines too). Not a big deal but if you're nit picky it can bother you. 4.5 stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love games great game great for kids if like temple run way way way better 100times better mom loves it
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I loved the game, but I had to delete it and 're download it to play it again. I had to start from the beginning again, but I think it was worth it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am such a huge fan if TWD! I Love being able to watch it any time I want to!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly additive and loads of fun. My daughter threatens to find a Candy Crush Rehab Center and send me to it.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This novel has as much suspense, courtroom drama, and character development as the first book in the series plus another surprise  ending that I should have anticipated.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Wonderful story about a child's experience on a magical train that took him on a journey to the North Pole, where he met Santa and received the first present...one of the sleigh bells that can only be heard by true believers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|.....<br />....I love this game needs to let us play longer. More lives I tell ya. Bring on the gifts
B0042U94UQ|5.0|A modern classic for kids. So funny. My 5 year old loved it and has watched it about 15 times.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|A lame excuse for a death metal album; musically it's like shrapnel in the ears. It holds no bearing on anything this band has done in the past and, hopefully their next album will be marketed at a lower price for the rip off that this one has been.<br />Honestly, since this album has been released, MA's live shows don't include ANY tracks from this album.<br /><br />Morbid Antel should keep surfing the wave of their former glory because that's obviously all they are capable of doing -- keeping their sound back in the 90's.
1594200823|5.0|This book inspired me to transform my eating habits.  Michael Pollan does an excellent job of describing the effect of our industrial food system.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|This movie does a wonderful job of leaving clues, the obvious is purposeful misdirection, and it will make you want to discuss it, as the ending deliberately poses questions for the viewer to think about.  This movie shows that Affleck is a gifted director, one of my all time favorite movies.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|As a 'stand-alone&#34; film, this is entertaining and a wonderful display of acting with long dialogues that describe life as we know it.  But I highly recommend seeing all 3 films, which then approach 5 stars as a group. In addition to terrific acting, each shows areas of Europe as a background.  An amazing expression of life, aging and the change in priorities and meanings.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like this app a lot. But it is of course a little slow and monotonous. I have other game that are far more interesting.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I love the experiment approach! A unique way to help you change how you see your world. Easy to understand and entertaining to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has gotten better than temple run. I like it more then  temple run because it fun they should make subway surfer 2 ,I am sure it would beat temple run 2!!!!
B00CNB31U0|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen. The characters are classic and the show stays true to the legendary characters while the actors make each of them into their own unique personalities. They evolve and grow from episode to episode, season to season, increasing their depth and complexity, and it's amazing to me how the writers and actors accomplish this. Another essential ingredient contributing to my enjoyment is the humor. I believe it is the most important component to the show's longevity. It balances the darkness inherent to the legendary magic and warfare while also deepening interest and audience investment in the individual characters. I'm looking forward to the sixth season and wondering what will happen to the dragons. As ancient and superintelligent as they are, even they evolve, grow and age. The scenery and effects are amazing and appropriate to the story - not phony or over-the-top. The entire production is top notch because it draws you into the world to experience the whole epic story.
B004I744AS|3.0|How much can you really say about a dictionary? Not a bad app but I don't really need it and when I do need to look something up it's simple enough to just go google it. So even though it's not a bad app, it's not really.... something you need.. You know?
B00GX59QO2|4.0|I just saw this last night and i must say i liked this one better than the first i mean such a great cast of actors top notch ones and the blend between comedy and non stop action made this movie worth the time if you seen the first see this one its good.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|Boring, boring boring. Gets old really fast. Not all that much to do and can be the slightest bit frustrating at times. Got rid of it soon after first playing.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|this is a great album and so many cool hip songs just like the first one this has timeless songs and Justin is such a great singer who never stops with the hits can't wait for any other albums in the future. get it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Much better than trying to use facebook on my kindles web browser. You can't play any of your facebook games on it (which you probably figured anyways) and you can't sort the order of things in your news feed, so that makes it a tad bit annoying when things you saw earlier are suddenly popping back up at the top again, all out of order, but for what it is this is a good app and I use it pretty often without issue.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|but i do know good freebies and this freebie is good i've used it atleast once or twice a week since the download on my kindle fire (1st gen), and i can declare it's faster.why not give it a try.IT IS FREE'
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Great app I love it its fun and easy  awesome  and I really reccomend it for people that like challenges
1582701709|5.0|Live by it - it works!<br /><br />Don't let naysayers cloud your judgement.  Rhonda isn't the first to preach thinking positive, however the format and stories of this book put it in great perspective and it is easy to read and digest.  It is harder then you think to think positively on a consistent basis, but when you get off course you just need to pull yourself back in.  Once you understand this and pay attention to things around you, you will be startled to hear over and over again how people who wanted something (doesn't have to be monetary)believed in it, and got it.  Even people who may not have read this book, but have the inherent gift to believe have achieved great things.  As the lyrics of one of my favorite songs goes, &#34;Deja, deja, deja vu, believe it and it will come true&#34;…. The co-author of this song has achieved unbelievable success by believing and thinking positive and it is his way of telling others his &#34;secret&#34; of success.<br /><br />Without going into details I will say that I got one of my wishes.  It did not play out they way I asked, but actually better than I could have dreamed.  I am now married to someone who I had known all my life and is the perfect fit for me.  We never thought (without the other ever knowing) we'd be together but then a serendipitous event changed our lives forever!<br /><br />I reread parts of this book randomly and have almost always marveled that whatever page I open to fits what I am thinking.  I have lent this book out to numerous family and friends and in doing so I have had to purchase 3 copies as 2 never made it back to me.  I trust for all the right reasons!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Good graphics, great for helping to keep my eye to hand coordination. And it lets me win once in a while.  :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow, better than I expected.  I saw the review for this in People and it sounded interesting.  It started out slowly, but gained momentum as Liane wove the individual stories together.  As I got into the book I found it hard to put down and did not guess the ending. A worthwhile read and I will look into her other books.
B00009L1TA|5.0|great movie. no one seems to know of this flic, but after seeing it they all agree.... good one, suspense to the very end.
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|I finally got around to reading this novel. Not entirely what I expected after all of the hype.  Interesting story but choppy and a bit hard to follow.  I will watch the movie and see if that is any better.  I am a huge reader, I just never got around to this until now.  Well, now I now!
B005T87QCI|1.0|The free game is much better this was just a waste of my money if it was possible there would be 0 stars
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you like Facebook this will keep you up to date! And you can get all your messages, photos, etc.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Engrossing read. Hard to put down. I would definitely recommend this. It's a long book, but that was fine, because I didn't want the story to end.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a simple calculator that does what it is supposed too with no cuz. The keys are big enough for fat fingers! That matters.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|An easy to use interface. I would like to see a broader selection under discover but otherwise very happy with this one.
0385349947|5.0|very to the point and inspirational! many new topics that really make you think about you career differently! great job sheryl!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent story line and good acting.  The characters continue to develop as the story unfolds.  Something for everyone: romance, intrigue, suspense, villains and good guys as well as petty completion.
B0000640SA|5.0|For being used. It came in great shape. Love this movie. See the movie in forward and the other puzzles on disk tow were well worth the price.
1444737112|5.0|Anyone who knows anything about me knows that I'm bats about cats, so, why it took me so long to discover this wonderful story is a mystery and a great shame.  A friend who regularly saw Bob at Covent Garden recommended the book and I read it non-stop all evening (well, until 2 am actually).  I was enthralled.<br /><br />The story is so well-known that there is no point in recapping it.  Suffice to say that the jury's still out on whether the street-musician saved the streetcat from possible doom or the streetcat saved the street-musician from skid row.  You need to read for yourself and decide.<br /><br />It's an exceptional story, heart-warming and moving.  More than once, I had tears in my eyes while reading.  It doesn't profess to be a literary masterpiece, just an honest, well-told story that will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Highly recommended - and not just for cat lovers &#62;^.^&#60;.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Loved Season 2 even more. Could not stop watching. These two characters are amazing and what you see if not what you get.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Been a fan ever since the clockwork series. Filled with action, fantasy and romance with a HUGE twist! Definitely one of my favorite books!!! Couldn't pick up the second book fast enough! I've completely fallen for bad ass character, Jace, could totally be best friends with Clary and Simon, and can't get over Isabell's kick butt personality. I recommend this book for anyone who loves action and fantasy genres, or anyone who has read the clockwork angel series! You will love this book!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing Spider, it's challenging, fun and you can spend hours trying to win against the computer. Try it, I know you will like it.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Though I came late to this trilogy, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I bought the trilogy and read all three books. I couldn't stop, I became completely hooked.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Loved it! Compelling story, beautifully shot and the Superman ain't bad to look at.  I absolutely adored Christopher Reeve as the man in the cape, so I knew going into the move it was going to take a lot to impress me.  This movie delivered.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book pulls heart strings for sure especially when u r extremely emotional like myself. I cried through half the book while I read this in the hours of the morning. This book is truly enticing and enriching. It tells you life goes on and everyone makes their own legacy one step at a time.
B000HT34RA|5.0|Although I 've never been a big fan of John Mayall, partly because of his vocals, I must, of course, admit that &#34;A Hard Road&#34; is an important and interesting album; characterized by fine songwriting with a solid foundation in the blues. For me though, it is especially Peter Green's presence that makes the album so special - like Clapton’s was on the first Bluesbreakers album.<br /><br />Green's guitar playing is asd impressive as on the first Fleetwood Mac albums and several songs could easily be mistaken for early Fleetwood Mac - especially when Green is allowed to take the lead vocal.<br /><br />On the original album, which here is supplemented with 14 fine bonus tracks, it's songs like &#34;A Hard Road&#34;, &#34;The Same Way&#34; and &#34;Top of the Hill&#34; that may stick with you.  Also the two sublime instrumentals &#34;The Stumble&#34; and &#34;The Supernatural&#34; give the album weight.<br /><br />Generally you get some fine and well played white blues, as it is known from Mayall and his band, which in this case consiste of Peter Green, Aynsley Dunbar and John McVie.<br /><br />Among the bonus tracks there are also a variety of goodies to find. The catchy single &#34;Looking Back&#34; is one of the most commercial songs Mayall has released , and the number is both well arranged and played with a twinkle in the eye.<br /><br />&#34;Alabama Blues&#34; is a nice little Peter Green thing which  originally was first released in 1971 on the &#34;Thru ' the Years&#34; album.<br /><br />An great EP released with Paul Butterfield is included in its full length, and especially &#34;Ridin 'on the L & N&#34; is a treat.<br /><br />Another very fine single from January 1967 &#34;Sitting in the Rain &#34; / &#34;Out of Reach &#34; is worth noting. &#34;Sitting in the Rain&#34; is a stripped-down blues song, much in the style of Fleetwood Mac's ”Leaving Town Blues&#34;, while &#34;Out of Reach&#34; is a pure Peter Green blues ballad .<br /><br />Finally , there are four BBC studio recordings which sound surprisingly great.<br /><br />A very recommendable release, for everybody who has even just the slightest interest in the blues.ere are four BBC studio recordings which sound surprisingly great.<br /><br />A very recommendable release, for everybody who has even just the slightest interest in the blues.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Previews to this seemed like it sucked. But it has a decent plot and story line/special fx are good. So watch it.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book is amazing. I've learned so much about giving more, and incorporating it into my life... And guess what, this knowledge works! I've been getting a lot more from people by giving more. Terrific read. I had to read it for my Business class, but turns out I loved it!
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Good movie for adults or kids. Kept my wife and I entertained on our flight. I thought it was going to be cheesy because its a animation but not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so cool and I really enjoy playing this app 5star rating for you guys keep making fun games like this hope I gave you a good report
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|After playing this game, I bought Fire Maple's other two games!<br /><br />This is reminiscent of Myst (without the horrible frustration). I feel like I've found a real gem, here.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Exactly what i needed. Good sound quality at an affordable price. Ideal for interviews and recording in controlled settings. If you are gonna do exteriors or some kind of moving during the recording, you might have some issues with the long cable
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|I was disappointed in this book. I found it to be somewhat juvenile in the way the story was laid out. It seems to be trying to bring up some interesting questions which might cause the reader to reconsider their views on life and society, but it misses the mark in doing so, in my opinion. I felt neither challenged nor intrigued by it. Also the conclusion of the book seemed listless and desperately wanting for direction. I did enjoy the first part of the book, up until just after the training began. After that, it seemed like the author lost interest in the story her/himself and it seemed to meander. I'm giving it three stars though because I did like the style of writing.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is a great 2D version of minecraft with a twist. Magic and spells and a friend called skeletron are a couple of features I enjoy, buy the game to find out who skeleton is...
B00DR590OM|1.0|So bad it is unusable. Tried to make it work on Panasonic FZ 200 and Canon S 95. Eventually gave up.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I've played THIS game and it's very boring. The colors are pretty but it's just boring and needs more work
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't usually care for books told in first person narrative, but these books are an exception, in that they are exceptional. What an amazingly great story. Suzanne Collins is a treasure.
B005X8N9T8|1.0|If you are in the United States, Do Not Buy This! It Is An Import!<br />DVD's will not play on your standard DVD Player.<br />I am not sure why the description doesn't say this product is a Region 2 set
B002JWD6AS|2.0|Not my favorite book about werewolves, I felt the charters lacked appeal, and chemistry.  Maybe because it is a YA book / but I have found other YA books I enjoyed and felt better connection with the charters.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Different from the one on<br />Facebook, seems easier, but still fun to play since I can't play on Facebook on my Kindle
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|I wanted to love this book... However I just barely liked it.  I enjoyed the twist on Cinderella fairy tale.... However, her true identity is given away to the reader way to early, and if frustrates me that she didn't get it sooner so the big reveal to her at the end is a bit anti climatic. I get why the ending was left as it was so you will read book two ... And three...<br /><br />I'm not sure which plot was to be the main focus - the plague that is wiping out the country with no cure, or well  a cure that could turn their lives into slavery, or the true identity of Cinder and what she could possibly do for the Earthen people and Lunars...if they ever get to know who she truly is .  With a mix if forbidden love if he can get past her being cyborg,  and her horrible step family....<br /><br />Maybe book two will be better and clearing this up...
B00C76076C|5.0|One of our favorites. We have been waiting for this movie to be released again to add to our Disney collection.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|This is one of those movies of the current model:  It is extremely expensive and worth 5% of it.  The story and dialogue were rather stupid and devoid of any emotion whatsoever.  It reimagined everything we came to know about superman since his big summer movie debut in... 1978? It spoke badly of krypton and its people, which doesn't say much about Superman's stock. Hollywood; you can't build a new franchise on eye-candy - and that eye-candy could have been better served with a competent presentation.
6305428042|5.0|My favorite Halloween movie of all time- a great Disney production, with a nice trio of actresses playing the 3 witches- I would suggest this is suitable for ages 9 and up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is quite unusual since it really puts your mind in deep thinking mode as you figure out how to get from one room to another. it isn't at all easy. Great game for people with analytical minds.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great story and I like how the Marvel movies tie together. Captain America is an awesome soldier fighting for his friends and country.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I like this version of the &#34;Dash&#34; games easier to play.  In the Android version, at least when you click on items you don't have to go back and re-click them again because they didn't register the first time.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson always delivers and this book is no exception. I liked all the characters and their interactions and even though I usually don't like reading first person perspectives, I found that I really liked the way this story worked from that perspective.<br />The basic concept of the book that absolute power corrupts absolutely and that when average people are given superpowers, they don't fight for good,They become self indulgent, power hunger warmongers. Someone has to set things right and that's where David, the main character and the Reckoners, a gang of rebels dedicated to ending the reign of the Epics (Super humans) comes in.<br />The story moves along quickly, setting up a basic backdrop of David's story and then moving right into the non-stop action. I highly recommend reading it if you like Sanderson's work and I personally am looking forward to the sequel due out next fall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The title of the review says it all. It's fun, super addictive and can be frustratingly challenging. A puzzle game well worth playing!
0375869026|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books for myself and my students.  I read it to them daily and they often asked when I was going to read it again.  They fell in love with it too.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Perfection as usual.......This is the first Opeth album I ever heard and that was all she wrote..Loved it.  A very accessible yet complex album
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tinnitus that keeps me awake unless I have background sounds- this app is great for creating your own personal mix. It's super easy to use with lovely graphics. Love it!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I finished it in 3 nights. I can't wait to start the next next 2 following.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|An incredible story about a courageous young woman and how she turns a tragic accident into something positive, giving God the glory.  I have recommended this bio to many of my students and every one of them have thought it was super.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Lots of fun. Takes a lot to keep up sometimes, if you don t take the time to keep up. Remember to leave space in your storage to save up to feed the troll.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game and that I can get it for free.<br />My grandkids play and love it and have their own competitive games using this application.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is by far the best open world sandbox creation game on the Appstore. The 2d graphics allow for a very retro minecraft experience, but it's also packed with way more features than minecraft pe and the boss battles and NPCs give the game a very dynamic structure that gives it some feeling of progression.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you've ever wanted to kill the world's population, this is for you.<br />You're given the choice of several pathogens- bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, prions, etc.<br />Every one needs a different strategy, and there are three levels for each.<br />There's so much to play with here, you just have to try it to know how exceptional this game is.<br />There's even a zombie virus!<br />Try it- you can't go wrong with this game!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game! Some people think it is gross. So why are you still reading this.You should be getting this app right now.Now get it!I give this app 5 stars.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Scary but funny at the same time.  I do find this somewhat similar to Olympus Has Fallen.  But still good!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I cannot add anything more to what has been said already. Incredible album, and after listening to it, it became such a part of my life, and expressed so eloquently my feelings about such. I bought it based on Kenny Loggins heritage and a You-Tube video, and fell in love with all immediately, including Georgia's voice. Note: I am a former musician, privileged to have &#34;warmed up&#34; the crowd for may greats in my time. Now I'm simply waiting for their next!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I can now play on my kindle! It's much better than playing on my phone. I can continue my addiction :-)  Fun but frustrating game!!
B001G1ACVY|4.0|I Love him  He has great talent.  I like the jazzy, sazzy, pop, funk style.  I pop his CD in on a regular basis.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush, I'm addicted. Love mixing the stripes with the color chocolate balls.. this game is really fun and all the levels are crazy, i wanna finish just to get to the next one.
B00821PCJS|4.0|very good story, pretty good acting, I have been waiting for a dystopian alien invasion show for a long time!!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Love the guy reading the book. 'Listening'- is a great way to revisit this classic. My husband and I are enjoying it together
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was hesitant to watch such a potentially violent movie, but in fact was \\"tastefully\\" done while keeping with the movies overall theme about...i won't spoil the plot or moral portrayed...turned out worth my time and am looking forward to the sequeal.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I like smart fantasy shows, and this one has it all!  Mystery, action, surprises, suspense... great acting and a compelling story that makes you think, I can't say it any better than some of the reviews I read before I watched this series, only that I loved it and I wish there was more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|We just absolutely love Minecraft. It's worth the higher price than other apps. We have been playing it (me and my 3 boys 5-11 yrs old) for about a year & a half now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Having made a point of reading this book before seeing the movie, I find that I enjoyed the book so much that I really don't care if I see it or not.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a SciFi that is delves into the futture, the past, and the minds of our children. If you are an adult, do you remember dow your mind worked as a child? Orson Scott Card remembered when he wrote Enders, and that is one of the best parts of the story.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Keep up the good work<br />This a lot better than the older deer Hunter the money isn't as hard to earn and the prices are not super high anymore so the game is now enjoyable and fun thanks
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It's very useful. It's easy to read and is a great dictionary. You should use it. Ta ta! :) :D
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is such a good game. I enjoy playing it. One of my favorite games of all time. So much fun
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Was just as funny as the first one!  Loved the minions and el macho!!!  And loved to see how gru handles the girls growing up...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is fun. If you like fast paced games about dodging and running  this is for you. There are like no glitches or things messed up ever.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is everywhere and, like it or not (I'm starting to get really sick of it for a myriad of reasons from Mark Zukerberg to the ridiculous stock opening and plummeting…), everyone seems to have a Facebook account/page.  This is a great app, easy interface and easy to navigate.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I bought this book to read on a flight I was taking in five days.  Here it is three days till my flight and I just finished it.  Could not put it down.  Had me hooked in the first couple of pages and never let go!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Awesome!  C'mON, It's James Bond and he perpetually kicks ass with his ingenuity and well-honed spy craft…I love it that he always gets the hottie and that good always trumps evil.  Daniel Craig is particularly good in this film and he sizing up nicely as the newest Bond among a host of fine 007 actors.  Lots of action, taught plot, well acted all around - Skyfall is a no brainer - get it, rent it, enjoy it.  It rocks!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Even when things appear to be hopeless, there are unknown wonders waiting just around the corner.  This movie is absolutely charming and leaves the viewer with a sense of hope and optimism, qualities sorely lacking in these current times.  There are many surprising and unexpected gems in this film and I highly recommend it!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Fine App, works well for this ever increasingly popular social networking service. Not buggy at all, good interface.  No problems as of yet and no problems equals a 5 star rating from this guy.
B008JFUORW|5.0|Just what I wanted to cheer me up! Not as funny as the first ones, but still enjoyable and entertaining.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great, timeless, classic game of strategy that is well-rendered here and easy to navigate.  Well done.  Highly recommend to the beginner and avid enthusiast alike.
B004OA6KIS|5.0|True scientists must have integrity or they cannot be called scientific. Science is the only endeavor where honesty is a must, else truth is lost. Richard P. Feynman was one of our most honest scientists. What a loss his death has made for humanity.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's Adobe and you need it if you are going to be working with pdf's...it has become essential software in the numerous areas and fields.  All I can say is, you need this to be current so get it and employ it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Slow to start, but becomes impossible to put down. A deep look into what is to be human, told in a unique perspective.  Deep, thoughtful, beautiful this story will stay with me forever.
B004GJYROG|5.0|My boys love this movie. I have a 2 and a 10 yr old and they can't seem to get enough of it. I always find my self watching as well. The VHS tape finally broke so I ended up buying the disc.
0385349947|5.0|This is a well-written, well-researched book. I enjoyed reading Sheryl's observations and experiences about women in the workplace and could relate to many topics. I will be recommending this book to my male and female colleagues.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|I grew up watching this series and loving it. Since discovering the series on Amazon Prime I have introduced it to my 10 and 7 year olds. They absolutely love it and want to watch it way more the tween junk TV! Yes, it is over-acted, the sets and costumes are really low budget but the stories are solid and. Loyalty, honesty , respect and being a science geek are rewarded while treachery, lying and lust for power are punished. Awesome series!
B0061S073A|5.0|My children are loving having all their apps easily accessible. I enjoy that my youngest can not &#34;accidentally&#34; rearrange my apps on my tablet and they can even use YouTube now without the fear of inappropriate videos being displayed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|After frequently coming across Paulo Coelho’s famous quote from The Alchemist, “When you want something, the entire universe conspires in helping you to achieve it” I decided to read The Alchemist. This novel is a simple tale of a shepherd boy Santiago and his journey in discovering himself and seeking his ideals. This entire tale is a wondrous journey that inspires you to realize your dreams. And to always follow your heart and never compromise in your journey to attain your life’s purpose. If our efforts are sincere, we will always have help to achieve or goals. Precisely written, this book will certainly re-confirm your faith in your ideals.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|If you appreciate good films don't bother.  We quit watching the triple X movie in the first few minutes.  The nudity and sexual content was totally unnecessary and a cause for anyone, who views sex as more than merely animal lust, to toss it in the trash.
B002S0KBUY|5.0|A beautifully written novel, My Sister’s Keeper is a moving and thought-provoking story of the Fitzgerald family and their struggle for hope and survival amidst situations rooted in tragedy.<br /> Brian and Sara Fitzgerald is a regular American couple. Brian is a firefighter, while Sara, a civil attorney, gives up her career to bring up their children, 4-yr old son, Jesse and 2-yr old daughter, Kate. Their life is plunged into darkness when Kate is diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, a very rare form of blood cancer. Kate is immediately put on chemotherapy, but her only hope for survival is to have a bone marrow transplant. The first choice for a donor is Kate’s brother, but unfortunately Jesse turns out not to be a match. Highly skeptical as to when they will find another donor, Brian and Sara decide to have another baby….and this is how Anna Fitzgerald comes into their world, with the sole purpose to save her sister’s life. Anna is specifically ‘designed’ with the right set of genes so that she is a perfect genetic match/donor for her sister. Immediately after Anna’s birth, her cord blood is transplanted into Kate, but it does not stop here. Over the next several years, Anna is subjected to several surgical procedures to save her sister.<br /> When Anna turns thirteen years, Kate suffers from massive kidney failure and as always it is decided that Anna has to donate one of her kidney’s to Kate, as it is her final chance to survive. Meanwhile, Anna has taken some pretty important decisions of her own. Too scared to admit it to her family, Anna approaches a lawyer to sue her parents for the rights to her body. She refuses to donate her kidney, despite being aware that it might be the cause of her sister’s death. What follows is a series of tumultuous events and intense court sessions, which threatens to tear their family apart.<br /> The author raises some ethical, moral, and mostly unanswerable questions about how anyone can make a life-or-death decision about a terminally ill loved one. What are the complications of putting one person in pain or in danger for the well-being of another? As parents, how far would Brian and Sara go to keep Kate alive? Do they unknowingly begin to favor one child over the rest, just because she is sick? And do parents solely have the right to decide what is right/wrong for their children.<br /> I can assure you that after reading this book you will see your family in a new light. And especially if you have a sister you will just want to hug her and never let go.  So I would recommend this novel to everyone, but make sure to have a box of tissues handy. You will be shedding more than a few tears.r-death decision about a terminally ill loved one. What are the complications of putting one person in pain or in danger for the well-being of another?

1433502445|5.0|Enough has been written about the ESV transalation, so I won't add to that. The binding and paper of this are really first class and now 4years later it looks as good as ever and I am sure it will go the distance.
B002R88G5E|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a sweeping tale of love, loss and the revival of hope. This story takes us to the war ravaged land of Afghanistan, where two generations of women struggle to find their identities and survive amidst death and loss. The characters of Mariam and Laila will stay with you long after you finish reading. From foe to friend, an unlikely friendship blossoms between the two women as they stand by each other through thick and thin. The book is also in a way a celebration of the immense will of women who steadfastly carry on despite the burdens and sorrows that life has to offer.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|Graphics were nice when I first opened the game. After that I was lost. No kind of instruction to at least get me started so that I could at least start my way to figuring it out.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|Watchers by Dean Koontz was a fantastic read! It is a tale of how much havoc can be caused by the disastrous effects of science that goes wrong. Two genetically engineering creatures have escaped into the world and the book outlines the course of these two creatures and their encounters with the human world. The central human characters, Travis and Nora are likable whose simple love story will put a smile on your face. But the real heroes turn out to be Einstein and the Outsider – one immensely smart and the other simply terrifying – symbolizing the contrasting effects of science.
B009PHRIAE|5.0|Much of this music is a total treat, clear and joyous. Br&uuml;ggen is a master of both his instrument and his repetoire.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I awaited Karan Johar’s fourth directorial attempt eagerly as it was a subject drastically different from his earlier attempts. Though ‘My Name is Khan’ deals with sensitive topics such as terrorism and religious identities, what appealed to me most was the unusual and touching love story between Rizwan and Mandira. These characters were brilliantly portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol respectively. Two romantic songs - ‘Sajdaa’ and ‘Tere Naina’ stand out for their mellifluous tones. My Name is Khan reflects on the message that faith does not determine a person’s character and it is only actions that determine a person’s worth. A must watch for SRK and Kajol fans!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Not his usual great writing, seems a bit boring at times. I found I could put this book down and return to it later, not like some of his other books, where I had to keep reading and couldn't put down.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|this set has so much detail that I have never known about the movie itself.a must have if you want all the extras and the music box is solid and very well detailed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game cannot get it to download......it starts but never finishes.  I don't understand why it does not finish.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|We watched them win on Sing off and are delighted to see they are still recording. Their performances have a new take on the current standards which are always solid and easy to listen to.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love how it will keep my five year old daughter buisy. but there is to much blood for kids under the age of six. otherwise it is fantastic.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|This app is good  but not a cool! one.  What I don't like is that you can't play with real people. Not two or three players can play. This is a good app. If you don't know what I mean then your just crazy.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book told the story of Danny Torrance's life after &#34;The Shining&#34;. It wasn't as gripping as some of King's early novels, but it was more introspective.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Compelling story that grabs the reader from the first page, beautiful, lyrical prose.  Donna Tartt at her best.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!!!! I have been dreaming of getting this game and now it's on the Amazon Appstore!!! Don't mistake it as a rip off of minecraft cause it's nothing like minecraft. But it is still a great game.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It's hard to believe that one man could have survived all that exposure to death and live to write about it.<br />Chris Kyle was a very special person.<br />I'm a vet, US Air Force medic, 1968 to 1972
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Good movie about a marine who had &#34;the back&#34; of Native Americans that helped the USA win WWII in the Pacific.
B000NMW6J8|1.0|Plot: Guy professor who teaches classes on US \\"home grown\\" terrorists groups. The groups that we were taught about in the 90s . . . Americans . . . for generations . . . wanting to destroy government, not foreigners wanting to invade and destroy us. He not teaches classes about this group because we learn his wife, a former FBI agent, was killed by a bomb. So some people move in next door. One thing leads to another. The guy suspects that his neighbors are terrorists. So you have to decide . . . are they? Or is the guy crazy because of what happened to his wife and what he thinks about all the time given his profession?<br /><br />Comments: This is a liberals dream come true movie. It shows \\"rednecks\\" who value their guns killing government agents. It talks about \\"Christians\\" who are violent. Etc. And the movie makes you think that they are everywhere and just evil and out to get you. It creates all the suspicions about the people that liberals despise. The problem here is the groups stereotyped in this movie are not the enemy. It is about as fake as the setting. You see a sprawling green campus that is supposed to be George Washington University. GWU is in downtown DC and is lined by city sidewalks. But the camera spans and shows the US Capitol building. Fake. Reston Mall? More fakery in this movie. The drama built up was kinda cheap. You have bright lights shown on the actors' scared faces. You have screaming background music (not an actor screaming but the music) while someone is thumbing through a newspaper or book and sees someone. It is just absurd. The only reason I even gave this movie one star other than I had to select at least one was the ending. It was kinda shocking and clever. But again it played into this \\"they are everywhere . . . beware of EVERYONE\\" motif. It is just wrong and irresponsible
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I didn't see the ending coming, but that's par for the course with Flynn's books.  Love to read her work!
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|Saw them live on this tour, second row, right in front of Alex !!!!!!!  Great live concert and great live cd/DVD !!!
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|The movie was just plain not good. Save your money. Wait for it to come to prime instant video and watch for free.
B00F2HW220|5.0|Love all of Arjen's music. Always great melodies, both lyrically and musically, with many talented musicians and vocalists. Buy it, you'll love it !!!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The casting was perfect. Everyone in the movie did an excellent job. We`ve seen it 4 or 5 times already.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A poignant, heartfelt, gripping story of two women, generations apart, who share a story of life and finding a way to trust again.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is such an awesome game. Fun and so easy to learn, you'll be playing it in minutes! I bring them everywhere!
0553384775|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!  It was shocking and sad... sometimes inspiring and entertaining.  Hope the movie does the book justice.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I heard people talk about this show, but I never seemed to be around to see it, so when searching around with my brand new membership and saw it, I played the episode. Then I watched the full 3 seasons over the next week!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very entertaining game but it took way too long for the creators to make it available on the Kindle
B000ZLFALS|5.0|One of the best musicals i've ever seen. Brilliantly done to the Beattles music during such a pivotal point in american history. Absolutely Beautiful Movie!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found this book impossible to put down. Well written and believable.  Made me think twice about what the average German citizen must have gone through to live.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Heart breaking and inspirational at the same time.  Amazing story of the incredible strength and survival of one little girl.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a brain challenge which I find difficult as I have cognitive problems as  result of my me having MS.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Good movie with many constructive life lessons and good moral messages.  The movie is more intricate than it may first appear. I liked it even more the third time.
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|This movie is an incredible tribute to the men and women who served in the Vietnam war.  This film is very well put together and evokes a strong emotion response.  If you haven't seen it, you need to.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|What a meandering mess. Tartt starts off with a compelling story and then squanders it, much as her characters do, in a repetitive circle of substance abuse and mental masturbation. In that way, it's very similar to her first book, &#34;The Secret History.&#34; which deviated from an interesting murder mystery of sorts to simply waste time for pages on end in ruminations that had nothing to do with character development or plot. I know some will strongly disagree with me, saying I've missed the point, but to me, there is no point. Great writing can transcend any plot and take on a life of its own. And early on, there are glimmers of this potential. But in the end, it's not enough to inspire me to read even one more page than I already have.
B000XVK30S|5.0|Really funny movie that you can watch the whole family.  It's kind of hard to find clean movies that do not have the same plot over and over this movie has great cinematography.  The set designs are pretty cool and a great Halloween type movie that is not overly scary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|im a little ashamed at how much I actually LOVE this game. I played it once on Facebook to see what the hype was all about, and thought it was stupid...downloaded it on my kindle yesterday (thanksgiving day 2013) and am bowing my head in shame for already spending 5 bucks on lives bc I couldn't wait for them to refill. lol! I cant stop playing candy crush!
B0017XD3OY|5.0|just like the lone person alive in the world movies! i just like end of the world movies with a few lone surviveors.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I enjoyed the music they played on the talk show, &#34;Katie&#34;. I also, loved the idea of<br />A group of Dads getting together and by<br />Bonding thru MUSIC!!!! What a get example for the kids, using their brains to<br />Do something not only positive, but also<br />just plain old FUN!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to Candy Crush. I love it. Thank you for making available on the kindle fire. I can't wait to get more lives to play, I hate it when I run out.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's so easy for my 83 yr.young, going on 30 years Mom to use. She can't &#34;BREAK&#34;<br />Any device, as she feels she might, by<br />Looking up any information she wants or<br />Needs. To hear her say,&#34;JUST GOGGLE IT&#34;, is still a strange sentence to hear her<br />Say, but slowly, we're getting her up to date with the technology my sons and I<br />Enjoy by using Goggle search.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I downloaded this game to my kindle fire and I am not disappointed keep up the good work and expand on the packs. I can't way to see what u have planned for future packs.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Nice action packed movie! Love Mark Wahlberg! Good story-line. Kept my attention. Ending was great action! Loved bad guy getting playback in the end!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great start to an epic saga, and I can't wait to read more. Picking up the next installment tomorrow so I can find out what happens next. So many sub plots going on that mysteriously weave together to make one huge story.
B009ZE27US|5.0|This game is amazing to play and freak  your friends out  of  this world  and apropreit for any age and is so amazing I got more  of the apps.I suggest that you get this app
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|if you listen to the critics they are fUll of beans this is a movie made for kiddies and cartoon nuts. being a cartoon nut I liked it
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderfully refreshing and entertaining.  I feel like a part of their community.  The entire family can watch without fear of violence or profanity.  Wonderful!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|There is only one James T Kirk and he is here in this collection. Really Paramount, William Shatner was nice enough to write the book to take Star Trex forward instead of trying to rewrite it. He even provided the template for replacing him as the title character. As it is the cartoon was better then the current movies. This collection is proof.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this wondering what the fuss was about. Five minutes into the first episode I was addicted. Fantastic show, can't wait for the new season.
B005D6O13S|1.0|The shoe was marked 10M, but indeed the size was more like 7. I liked the color. It was returned.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a great show, I like the people I like this period of time. I have watched every season three or four times..written great. I did not like when the daughter died and I really miss Matthew..but<br />branson is coming around.....

B00AATV046|5.0|Bought this movie for the wife as a birthday gift, she really loves it as I do, we are not big movie buyers, but had to have this one and it shipped fast
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had to always been playing this app so much I REALLY Love it so much I REALLY hope everyone likes it.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|The Way of Kings pulls you in and doesn't let you go, not for an instant, not even during the occasional 50 page dry spells of plot inactivity. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, unlike Sanderson's other works (Mistborn, Warbreaker), it is the characters that make this novel interesting, rather than the world-building, plot, and magic system. Never have I come across a high-fantasy protagonist as grittily REAL as Kaladin.<br /><br />Sanderson's best work yet. I'm eager for Words of Radiance.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|not suitable topic for children - I don't even know what the game is but it is not suitable for any child
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Simple and fun as hell. I would recommend this game to everyone. Great graphics as well as realism. Keep up the good work
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is awesome free and fun for age 5-39<br /><br />You should get this game it is the best way to get in acton
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Got a little boring at times with all the freaky dreams but I loved the ending. She ended up with the guy I wanted her too
B000WZOMRA|5.0|Its a good, clean movie!  Its amazing how much people dressed up back then when it was made.<br />They use the word Jezebel they way its supposed to be used.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever all disk so also do I do so d disks smack six<br />Disks disk socks walls Walla also  so also a walls
B00DJZ06DO|2.0|How do you make a sequel to a series that basically ended in the apocalypse? Well, apparently you &#34;retell&#34; the entire story, move a few key plot points around, render the beautifully poetic message of the original finale moot and then go about explaining what exactly happened AFTER the world (sort of) ended.<br /><br />You Can Not Redo is what became of the White family after Breaking Bad ended. It's what Holden Caulfield grew up to be after he quit sulking and just got a degree in business. It's completely, utterly pointless, and it may as well be fan fiction for all I care.<br /><br />With the original (though somewhat reimagined) plot of Eva being successfully retold by the first two movies, 3.3 is essentially where the rehashing ends, and the full blown sequel begins. Granted this sequel is only applicable to the rebuild of the series, since &#34;remixing&#34; the original story arc and disregarding &#34;The End of Evangelion&#34; is necessary in order to keep things going, but for the most part the idea is the same: the world as we know it has ended, and humanity is once again left with the burden of forging ahead. It's here that we not only get a new version of what EXACTLY happened to the show's characters after 3rd impact (partially) occurred, but what became of the world itself. The ambiguity of the original conclusion has been replaced with a gigantic, meticulous mess that the viewer is left to watch get cleaned up.<br /><br />So here we are. 3rd impact was a botched, poorly implemented apocalyptus interruptus that put the fate of the entire world in the hands of a seriously angsty 14 year old boy. We knew that. What we didn't know however was that Shinji's decision to pull Armageddon out of the oven when it was only halfway baked has resulted in a desolate shell of a planet that's even worse off than it was before. A place where most of NERV has defected to battle their former employer, Eva units act as airships, nobody likes Shinji and Asuka has an eye patch. Also this all occurs 15 years in the future. Cool? Cool.<br /><br />Why exactly any of this needs to be told to us is beyond me, not so much because I don't like the plot of the sequel itself (which I don't), but because we simply don't NEED a sequel in the first place. At all. The entire point of the original series was to dissect what it means to find your place in the world when you have so much baggage you don't even know how to love yourself. It was a deep, mech driven self help exercise that also happened to be really fun to watch. And it ended on a pitch perfect note.<br /><br />This, on the other hand...I don't even know what this is. It's an interesting &#34;what if&#34; at best, which I guess is more than I can say about the first two movies, but that doesn't change the fact that the whole thing is a convoluted waste of everyone's time.<br /><br />All that said i'm giving 3.0 a star for the animation, since that aspect of the film is definitely well done, and with the impending release of 4.4 maybe Anno will finally be able to move on with his life life and do something new. I just hope we let him.curs 15 years in the future. Cool? Cool.

B004LROUW2|5.0|This is a truly fascinating novel. I can't put it down. Even thought it's long it's well worth the investment in time.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good movie.  Even though the action was often not believable, it was fun to watch.  Our teenage boys enjoyed the action.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show. Of course it doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you haven't been following it all along. Which is why I kind of like to buy the seasons from Amazon instead of watching them in realtime. That way you don't miss a beat, and plus, no commercials! Unless you've seen ALL the previous episodes, you don't know what they may or may not be talking about.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Great action and scenery.  My boys, age 12 an 13, loved the action.  My husband and I also liked the movie enough to watch it with them.  Sometimes my husband and I found it difficult to follow the plot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|a fun interactive game. I enjoy getting to take care of horses. the graphics are very good. can be slow at times, but still very intricate.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game with smooth graphics for an awesome price! Multiplayer is misleading as to you actually can only play via Bluetooth and not online, so that's a bummer! But the new sealed campaign and the ability to create your own decks is a huge upgrade from previous years. Overall I love this game though and it doesn't make my kindle fire HD heat up at all and I play for hours!
0716703440|5.0|This is what you must refer to in order to understand the the theory and the issues. It is organized and presented in a way that allows you to dip your toes in the theory before diving into the details.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Each level brings a new and exciting challenge. I would recommend this game to Rhodes who like to be challenge.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|Good songs, but a few that are soo hip hop with crap lyrics.  Highlights are Artpop, Applause,  Do What You Want, Mary Jane Holland.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Happy, this one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. And i totally love the you tube video. Pharrell is a phenom and he records on others' sound tracks but this one hits the charts. And of course you can't beat it on Despicable Me.
B00942Y35S|2.0|I did not watch the entire movie.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  too slow and predictable.  maybe the ending was a surprise, but I doubt it.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|My grandson could not put it down!  He is in third grade, and has already begun the second book.  Now he loves to read  &#34;chapter books&#34; and does it with ease.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This game is a real mind teaser and challenging to play. Learn how to use the hint magnifying glass and it will become easier. The game features absolutely beautiful graphics. The music is also gentle and calming. You can actually touch and move items in the scenes and they pop up and look almost 3D as the graphics are so good. As you collect clues you move to the fireplace and enter the code and pass through the fireplace into a world of wonder and amazement. You have to break the spell of an evil sorceress to save the people of Mosaika.<br /><br />On your journey it is important to make journal entries into the book. Touch everything to see if the book records any notes. You will need them as you progress through the new world. Some of the entries are codes that may be difficult to remember if you don't write them down. Also collect as many tools as you can find. If you flip up the magnifying glass you can get a hint. That keeps you from going crazy trying to figure out the solution to the entrance of various buildings for example.<br /><br />I really liked this maze game as it makes you think to solve the mysteries of the new world. It is a lot of fun for me and I liked play it a lot. I recommend it and as it is a FAOTD it is a great deal today. It is well worth the price of the game if you like these types of mystery and find the object games.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game. Easy to learn, fast paced. You can grow your city faster in this game than most without  having to purchase anything. Also a plus for this game is it keeps making you money when you are not actively playing.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|the message that this movie tries to put forth is marvelous. it is really about karma and how tightly we are all connected.
B006B7LQ90|5.0|Great book! gets right to the heart of the message. Easy to read and understand. One of the best marketing books I have read since I started my EMBA program. I am in my third of four semesters and the book was recommended by the Marketing professor and I found the book resonating well with what I have learned in my program so far.
B0013F1D02|5.0|whimsical fun enchanting cute. it's about true love. maybe it's me but i find that there is often hidden meaning in movies. this is one such movie.
0060574216|2.0|A nice fairy tail written to please all. Women are giving and gettting back little, they are social. Men are huntrs gatherers. If they could just communicate. All partial truths that assume that people are rational, and have common sense, which is not universally true. What about irrational, self centered people ( good portion of the population) that can not think of the other side at all, how would they even think about changing their communicatin style. What about inabilty to make decisions, depression, not knowing what one wantes but blaming the other for everything that is wrong in their life (also a good portion of the population). What about mid-life crisis that makes people in many instances irrational....Oh no... those things don't exist. If only men and women could speak the same language...
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I'll be adding this one to the collection later, funny movie, though I thought Jennifer Aniston was funnier in Horrible Bosses. Sudakis and the guy playing his son made this movie. Seemed to run slow then picked up and the outtakes at the end weren't bad either would definitely watch this again
B000002IR7|5.0|One of the  Hottest recordings  ever made.  It's  an Up Beat Delightful beat that elates your persona.  A Classic  by Booker T. & The MG's.  I have  all of them.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|created a lot more space. its very affective. I would recommend. this application to anyylone and everyone. I will continue to use this app.
B000050HTO|3.0|This  one is Not the best  but  I like Dylan  so I play it.  Doesn't  have  the 'kick'  as  his prior  deliveries  but  I'm not disappointed.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Good production values. I am glad I didn't read the book beforehand,it let me enjoy the movie on its own merit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm a guy and thought &#34;oh god what does my wife want to watch now?&#34;  But it's a great story with lots of sub plots, keeps moving, and the set is really well done. Not what I would have expected from a British TV series
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Hooked me as much or more than Angry Birds did. I finished it and am going back to make sure I didn't miss anything.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The extra features are great to watch, very interesting, other films just put extras cuz they have to.<br />Great behind the scenes part.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really missed the train on the whole Hunger Games \\"fad\\", until I enrolled in Prime and used the lending library. Boy, was I kicking myself! The three books are awesome, and the two films to date are exceptional. This final <sigh> book is suspenseful and keeps you guessing until the very end. Better late than never, but I am so sorry this is the end of the story line. At least I can look forward to the last movie!
B00DW36G32|1.0|Lame story line. And I'm being kind. A commonly overly used plot hopefully made believable/watchable with two high priced actors.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was not as good as the first and second by far but I loved the ending. I feel more could've been written.
B009IU6BIS|4.0|Always funny after all these years. This movie has become an annual event in our household. Entertaining. A reason for being a movie, correct.
0380018179|5.0|Thorn Birds review<br />A rather controversial subject...But life in itself is controversial.  The passion, love , warmth and tenderness of this story is truly worth the read....no matter what is your belief!  Great book, great price.  Thanks again Amazon....
B0065GC0BA|4.0|An easy to read book and well written. The character of Louisa Clark developed delightfully and you could relate to her.However the same can not be said for Will Traynor. I felt a bit ambivalent about his character. I am not sure whether the author wanted the reader to feel detached from his character, considering the ending. However it may be that the author wanted to create the feeling that he was depressed and felt helpless in his situation. I was wondering why his parents did not actively seek to treat his obvious depression. It should have been the first thing that they considered, especially seeing that he had attempted suicide previously. The parents appeared remote and had consigned him to an annexe, only visiting him infrequently. Was he an embarassment? Also what were they thinking employing an inexperienced carer to be his companion? Louisa did the best that she could, but how much easier would it have been if she knew what resources were avaiable and how to source them. She only had a computer at the library to obtain her information! I would really hope that this did not happen in real life!<br />I have a feeling that maybe the author wanted us to discuss depression and the plight of the disabled as much as suicide, which is a plus.
630463949X|4.0|The case had a little wear but the DVD was pristine. Double sided disk with a 5.1 version on one side and a stereo version on the other. Arrived on time and undamaged. For Fleetwood Mac fans this is an excellent concert. Shortly after this concert Christine McVie left the band so this is that last chance to see the band intact. Also Tusk was performed with the UCLA Marching Band - any other way just doesn't get the job done. I read other reviews that complained about Stevie Nicks voice but I thought her voice was fine. Lindsey Buckingham's voice especially on Go Your Own Way is getting a little raw. Of course his guitar work is still amazing. I have been a Fleetwood Mac fan since the 70's and was very pleased with this DVD. One slight irritation was the mix on Tusk - the Marching Band didn't come through as clearly as the album bversion. It seemed to me that they were not directly miked. All of Fleetwood Mac sounded great so the lack of direct miking on the Marching Band was noticable.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|It was love at first sight.  This is the best summation of my reaction to finally getting a chance to see Guillermo del Toro's new sci-fi tent pole production, Pacific Rim.  Pure, unadulterated love.<br /><br />You see, for me cinematic science fiction has definitely been heading in the wrong direction these last few decades.  As someone who grew up reading (and loving!) the great science fiction masters of yesteryear - authors such as Asimov, Bradbury, Hubbard, Saberhagan, and so many more - I have developed a distinctive taste for science fiction that doesn't just ask the great science fiction motivator question of \\"what if...?\\", but also provides a smart yet thrillingly imaginative answer to that question.  I admit that is a tall order to fill, yet somehow the old masters managed to fulfill that order time and again.  Strangely, Hollywood, despite its billions of dollars and army of scriptwriters, has been largely unable to do so.<br /><br />Instead, we have been force-fed a diet of either cartoonish and superficial science fiction along the lines of the $380 million dollar after school special that was James Cameron's Avatar, or we lurch to the other end of the spectrum and wind up being forced to suffer through an insipid lecture on the latest socioeconomic hobbyhorse that is taking Tinsel Town by storm, one merely disguised as science fiction by the misappropriation of that genre's robots/ray guns/spaceships/what-have-you so as to make the Marxist poison go down easier (I'm looking at you, WALL-E).  Whichever way Hollywood lurches with this stuff the end result has been the same for me:  it just isn't fun anymore.  Schoolyard silly?  Yes!  Tedious?  Absolutely!  But fun?  Er...no.  Nor truly imaginative, for that matter.  I swear, if I see one more jungle planet, or one more garbage dump planet, I'm going to get on a spaceship and leave for good....<br /><br />I think this is why I so readily fell in love with Pacific Rim.  This movie represents a return to science fiction fundamentals, to a time where the all important \\"what if...?\\" wasn't asked by a tedious professor of feminist studies,  but by a practiced storyteller with an active imagination.  In this case, the question is a classic one right out of the black and white glory days of sci-fi monster movies: \\"what if Earth was invaded by giant monsters?  And what if they only way to defeat those monsters was to 'create monsters of our own'?\\"  Now that is the question to ask!<br /><br />And from there the movie is off and running.  Indeed, \\"running\\" might be the perfect word as the movie immediately wows you with an eye-popping battle between a towering \\"Category 3\\" Kaiju (Japanese for \\"strange creature\\") and an equally towering Jaeger mech (no, not a 'robot') piloted by two human \\"ranger\\" pilots linked by a mental \\"drift\\", something that helps to better distribute the mental load of managing such a mighty weapon.  What results is the type of giant monster vs. giant mech battle scene that I have yearned to see since I watched Voltron as a kid.  It is just...awesome!  So awesome in fact that it almost brought a tear of nostalgia to my Gen X'er eye.<br /><br />I won't tell you what happens during that battle as it involves a pretty important plot point, but suffice to say that this battle will mark a turning point in mankind's eight year struggle against an alien invasion that originates from a multi-dimensional \\"rift\\" in the Pacific seabed.  For after this battle mankind's Jaeger offensive would begin to fail, leaving major cities along the Pacific Rim (hence the name of the movie) vulnerable to destruction from the claws and teeth of ever more powerful Kaiju.  Things get so bad in fact that mankind is ultimately forced to a last ditch defensive strategy involving the construction of massive \\"Anti-Kaiju Walls\\" to protect coastal cities, something that politicians assure the world will work where the Jaegers have failed...despite the fact that a Kaiju is soon seen to effortlessly smash his way through such a wall (clearly the same government contractors who have built the Obamacare website must have built these walls).  Of course, the Earth's only real hope still lies with the now abandoned Jaeger program, which is now exiled to Hong Kong with its last handful of functional Jaegers.  The question is:  can they turn the tide so late in the game, and with fewer resources than ever?  Classic underdog movie incoming!<br /><br />What results is an old school sci-fi actioner that keeps you on the edge of your seat as one frightful sea monster after another requires whacking with the massive metal hands - and rockets, plasma cannons, swords...amongst other weapons - of the last four mechs in existence.  These battles are truly eye-catching spectacles, particularly due to how Del Toro brings so much color to them.  The mid-movie battle in Hong Kong is particularly striking as it manages to catch a Blade Runner visual vibe with all the neon lighting and LCD displays in that city, something Del Toro uses to great visual effect.  But even the battles that take place out on stormy seas are wonderful to behold in all their detail.  I was particularly impressed by how Del Toro managed to avoid the oft chaotic battles that plague Michael Bay's dreadful Transformer movies where visual FX computers seem to haphazardly vomit pixels onto the screen.  While there are a few moments where Pacific Rim's battles can get a bit busy, it is never as muddled or confused as a typical Transformer's mash-up.  Instead, the audience gets to feel every blow and see almost every punch, leading to visceral fights that I couldn't help but to become emotionally invested in, especially after coming to appreciate how nasty the Kaiju are by nature.  I also enjoyed how Del Toro always seemed to position the camera in just the right way so as to convey the awesome size and power of these clashing behemoths.<br /><br />The great visual effects aren't limited to battles, either.  This movie just has a great visual style to it.  For example, I particularly enjoyed how Del Toro conjured up the ghost of World War II  by providing glimpses of propaganda posters throughout the film.<br />Even the Jaegers displayed the type of artwork on their chassis' that was often seen on the nosecones of B-24 bombers.  The weather was also used to good effect as most of the battles took place during dark and stormy nights...yes, yes, I have heard that this has something to do with covering up the limitations of CGI (1998's Godzilla used a similar technique), but I still found it to be an effective way to reinforce the apocalyptic tones of the film.  Lastly, the Jaeger cockpits were also nicely realized with their mechanical contraptions that translate human movements into mechanical ballets of death.  Listening to the actors grunt and groan with effort in their mechanical harnesses as they maneuvered their Jaegers in battle, just as modern fighter pilots groan against the punishing effects of \\"pulling G's\\"in a jet, made the battles all the more believable.<br /><br />Speaking of actors: unlike many contemporary sci-fi films of recent years, Pacific Rim's weight is borne not so much by its massive CGI metal shoulders but by its excellent cast.  Our protagonist, Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot recalled to active duty, is competently played by Charlie Hunnam.  Nonetheless, it is his co-stars that really steal the show.  Idris Elba delivers a home run performance with his cold-as-a-steely-Jaeger performance as Becket's commander, Stacker Pentecost, a man determined to save the world even if the world has long since given up on saving itself.  Becket's new co-pilot, Mako Mori, played by Rinko Kikuchi, is likewise a stunner, but this time in the \\"Lord, she's hot!\\" sort of way.  Rounding out the excellent cast are two mad scientists:  the professorial mathematician Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, played by Burn Gorman, and Dr. Newton Geiszler, the Kaiju specialist with rock star aspirations, energetically played by Charlie Day.  These two scientists basically go all Abbot and Costello during the film as they seek to find the solution to the Kaiju problem, but they do so with great comedic effect.  Add in Ron Perlman as a Kaiju black marketeer by the name of Hannibal Chau (I think this is one of his finest roles since Hellboy), and Ellen McLain, famed voice actress of GlaDOS from the game Portal (Del Toro is a gamer like most Gen Xers), as Gypsy Danger's AI, and you can't ask for a better cast than what is featured in Pacific Rim.<br /><br />The icing on the cake for me was Del Toro's use of religious, particularly Roman Catholic, symbolism.  As anybody who has watched this director's previous works understands, Del Toro always finds a way to bring a deeper spiritual meaning to his films and Pacific Rim is no exception, something that truly surprised me as I didn't think a giant mech/monster movie could have much spirituality in it!  Nonetheless, Del Toro found a way to bring in a few such references.  For example, our protagonist, Raleigh Becket, bears the surname of a great Catholic saint who opposed great power with mere faith, a fitting analogy for a man who is tasked with slaying monsters.  Of course, Becket's commander has the surname Pentecost...need anything else be said about this motivating Holy Ghost of mankind's resistance against the Kaiju?  Then we have the lesser character of Ops Officer Tendo Choi (played by Clifton Collins, Jr.) who wears a rosary around his wrist at all times.  Lastly, and most powerfully, we have a final scene where the American Jaeger 'Gypsy Danger' descends into the alien's hellish universe for one last sacrifice - the Christological symbolism is both visually and metaphorically striking.  Well done, Del Toro!<br /><br />Lastly, I found the music to be suitably rousing.  Somehow Del Toro combined the musical elements of rock, military marches, and Saturday afternoon cartoons into one pleasing theme!<br /><br />So, What's Not to Like?<br /><br />I have to be honest: there isn't a lot to not like about this film as long as you approach as what is is: a piece of  monster-bashing science fiction designed for some nostalgic fun.  Any flaws are really minor.  For example, after the opening fight sequence, the movie takes a rather lengthy pause as it sets up the story and introduces the major characters.  Fair enough - the time is put to good use - but I found myself getting antsy for the next fight scene.<br /><br /> I also thought the final fight scene was a bit underwhelming.  It takes place underwater at the Rift, something I thought had the potential to be wonderfully imaginative.  Sadly, with the exception of a few passing fish, the battle might have well taken place on land as there are few uses of the unique conditions I imagine fighting three thousand feet under the sea would entail.  And speaking of the final battle, Pacific Rim lazily falls back on the tired, old science fiction solution to every problem:  firing a proton torpedo into a thermal exhaust shaft two meters wide.  Same idea going on here.<br /><br />Another slight disappointment for me was the lack of detail concerning the 8+ year old war against the Kaiju, as well as the nitty gritty details surround the construction and maintenance of the Jaegers.  Del Toro has created a fascinating setting and I would have loved to been able to explore it in greater detail beyond the quick 10-minute intro at the start of the film.  Let's hope a few sequels rectify this flaw!<br /><br />Concluding Thoughts<br /><br />One of the things I found interesting about Pacific Rim was the generally downbeat reaction from the critics.  In many ways it reminded me of the confused and befuddled reaction many critics had to the rock solid mil sci-fi that is Battle: Los Angles.  Like then, I can only surmise that we are dealing with a systemic problem:  that we have a generation of critics that have been lulledto sleep by years of cartoonish science fiction along the lines of Avatar, Star Wars: Episodes 1-3, and countless other recent endeavors.  When confronted by a style of science fiction that is not only more soberly militaristic, but also lacks a Will Smith cracking jokes every few minutes (this was an actual criticism of Battle:LA from a prominent critic), I think most critics just fall off their bikes without their training wheels.<br /><br />But I think there is a deeper problem here, a generational 'rift', if you will.  Pacific Rim is, first and foremost, a Mecha movie.  Now, if you have never heard that term before it is probably due to the fact that you are NOT a Gen X'er.  Indeed, I find it a fun exercise to go through reviews of Pacific Rim and count the number of times Jaegers are referred to as \\"robots\\", a sure sign of a critic out of his depth (one recent review asked if this movie was based on The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers....*facepalm*).  Mechs have been popularized by countless amounts of Japanese manga and anime, such as Gundam and Voltron, not to mention lots of games as well (MechWarrior and Strike Suit Zero, for example), so we Gen X'ers have grown up with this stuff and completely understand what Del Toro is doing (again, a fellow Gen X'er).  With that in mind I think it is fair to say that Gen X'ers will/do enjoy this movie far more than Baby Boomers whom seem downright confused by the concept of walking tanks piloted by human Rangers!<br /><br />Whatever the reason for the disconnect between the critics and the fans, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a solidly entertaining piece of cinematic science fiction that will please both Gen X'ers who have longed to see mechs brought to the big screen, and, needless to say, those who are just looking for some entertaining monster science fiction in the vein of Godzilla or Gamera.  Succinctly: long after the likes of cartoonish and and politically correct sci-fi moves like Avatar are forgotten, people will still be watching Pacific Rim and its monster on mech mayhem.<br /><br />Old school science fiction has returned, and Del Toro gets the credit for putting the fun back into the genre.

0307271080|4.0|&#34;Americanah&#34; is a new novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Over the past fifteen years novels written by Americans from third world nations designed to enchant us but also to make a foreign culture less &#34;foreign&#34; and, ultimately, to make the Globe a little smaller. Ma Jian, Barbara Kingsolver, Rilla Askew, Paul Glaser,  Khaled Hosseini, are just a few of these authors and indeed they have helped to change the world. &#34;Americanah will as well.<br /><br />We are first given a taste of what it is to be an African professional in Princeton, New Jersey, and then we are taken to modern Nigeria, a city that is controlled by conflict, organized crime and supported by the oppression of the working class. The history of Africa is one that could take decades of study at which to become a scholar, but this book (not as good as &#34;The Poisonwood Bible&#34; but still very good) is an excellent way to get your feet wet. Not only does this book demand attention for the country of  Nigeria, but it demands attention to the Global problem of the maltreatment of women.<br /><br />Set atop of this all is a remarkable and fascinating plot that involves the love between two people in their youth and their reuinion fifteen years later as he works his way up the corrupt corporate ladder of business in Bigeria and she has created a name for herself as a respected Blogger in America with a substantial following. Both the character and the author have a remarkable skill at describing characters and Adichie places these deep characters in various situations, some of which are ludicrous and pave toward situations that are impossible and reactionary: indeed we are tested along with the charters regarding ethics, morality and love.<br /><br />There is no need to spoil the intrictae plot- just that you know there is one- but to know that this wonderful writer makes any plot believable through her deft skill at characterization. She introduces us to thoughts and situations that Nigerian women encounter that we would otherwise never have known. This is a work of fiction but it's a good example of how fiction is the best way to tell a true story.<br /><br />So why only four stars and not ive? Because if one is reminded of &#34;The Poisonwood Bible&#34; and &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; (both of which deserve ive stars) then to say this is just as good is just unfair. If we are to say that &#34;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&#34; is THE definiative American novel then even &#34;Stuart Little&#34; or &#34;To Kill A Mockinbird&#34; fail to compare. Not everything can be flawless.<br /><br />Americanah is a work of art and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is an artist. This is a wonderfully entertaining and exciting way to open your eyes about our changing world.gerian women encounter that we would otherwise never have known.

They are also easy to make, the ingredients are relatively easy to find (you do need to go to an Arab store for Sumac and Zaatar for example...but as I see it, that's part of the adventure!).  The results are wonderful: the food looks and tastes deliciously...the flavors are simple and yet blend wonderfully to create something &#34;wow&#34;!!!  I shared the Cauliflower fritters with friends and they were quite impressed at the work of my hands!! ;) (and I'm just a beginner cooking &#34;aficionada&#34; -I let them believe I know how to cook of course - but I love eating well and prefer cooking than eating out...I want to know what's in my food!!).

0385738781|3.0|Alright, I finally finished this series. And I’m disappointed. Not so much in the plot but in the characters.<br /><br />Plot: So the plot is pretty  good. The whole reason for the maze is revealed and wow, it is crazy!! I adored that the information was given to the reader right away. The reader isn’t being dragged through the book just waiting for information. The plot moves fast and so much is going on that as the reader you are excited!! As I read through this story, I couldn’t wait to see how it ended. All the connections where made through out the story, and it only awed me more of how well this story is written. It keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Love/Friendship: This is the part the bugged me the most. First off, the main character acts like a girl. Thomas is very emotional for a guy. In the sequel, I forgave him for it since he just learn a few things and was hurt. In this story, he was just a jerk. He never gave her a chance. He always used everything and any excuse against her and honestly I got tired of him throwing it in her face every few pages. He worried about her but he didn’t trust her. Seriously dude? Stop being butthurt about things and get over it. It was all a game. And the way he held it over her head really made me dislike him. Especially cause he fell for another girl with no real base for his feelings. It was like insta-love with the second chick. I did not like that at all. Seriously, he acts worse than a girl who is pmsing. Usually at the end of the book, I adore the hero. Not me. At the end of the book I was glad to be done with it because Thomas annoyed me. And I don’t like him.<br /><br />Ending: There are a few other plot twist that happens to characters that I’m not happy about. And why it is that authors have to kill off important people on the last book! HUH? WHYYYY??? This character didn’t even get the chance to redeem their self cause of the chaos yet they sacrifice everything….SMH (Dude, I’m so done with series books…)<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay book. I really like the plot but the love interest/ending really threw me off and I didn’t like the characters actions or decisions. And since the movie is coming out soon, I’m not even sure I want to watch the movie. Honestly, if this is the way it is going to end…then no. Just no. If you do decide to read this, then be prepared for some major changes.one with series books…)<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay book.

B00GME9AJK|3.0|The big surprise here is something I thought I'd never say - Ashton Kutcher is amazing and propels this limp 2 hour snooze fest into an engaging and believable broad-strokes sketch of Apple and Jobs. Kutcher gets the mannerisms and body language nailed so uncannily that at times you can almost feel you're watching Steve Jobs and not the guy from Punk'd.<br /><br />But tremendous and Oscar-worthy acting aside, the script takes the safe detour though any material that's controversial and edgy and skims over major parts of the Jobs story, including the rebuilding of Apple, his health and eventual death. Even his child whom he fails to acknowledge for over half the movie mysteriously shows up in the very next scene as a teenager on his couch with no explanation whatsoever.<br /><br />By neutering all the controversy, what could have been The Film to watch about this iconic character becomes a made-for-TV special adding very little that you probably don't already know. Still, it's so extraordinarily uncanny to watch Kutcher of all people to pull off the performance that's it worth viewing for that alone.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games, based on a series of books by Suzanne Collins is a gripping story that is made even better by Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Set in a dystopian future, the United States that we know suffered through a civil war and is now broken up into a number of districts, all working tirelessly and in abject poverty to support the capital city and their opulent lifestyle. To ensure the districts remember their loss in the war, two children are randomly picked from each district and are transported to the Capitol. The children are trained and put on display as instant celebrities for the consumption of the coddled public of the Capital City. Once ready, they compete in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death with each other, with the sole survivor named champion.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a very entertaining movie made all the better by the performances of the cast, most especially Jennifer Lawrence. She gives a dynamic, compelling performance that should not be missed!

This is a movie for people who enjoy sitting back and being entertained by fancy camera work, a story that has a plausible plot, smart dialog (Jon and Erich Hoeber), astute direction (Dean Parisot), and most of all a cast of some of cinema’s finest actors who look like they are having such a great time you don’t want the at times rather silly movie to end.<br /><br />The plot, twisted and turned now and then just to keep us glued, is simple that of a retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. The team includes John Malkovich (absolutely hilarious role for him), Mary-Louise Parker (often stealing the show), Helen Mirren (gorgeous as ever and having the time of her life knocking off just about everybody who gets in her way). The other folks who are on varying sides of the law (nobody really plays by the rules) include Anthony Hopkins (in stellar form), Catherine Zeta-Jones, David Thewlis, Brian Cox, Byung-hun Lee (in a brilliantly choreographed martial arts role and the physique to match), Neal McDonough, and Tim Pigott-Smith among others.<br /><br />No, it is not deep, but it is silly and funny and entertaining and an exceptionally good time. This cast deserves an ensemble award! Grady Harp, November 13
B00G3HSF7O|3.0|Elysium's premise is that the poor and destitute live on Earth in slums, enslaved in terrible jobs while the rich live on a Halo-like planet where they never get sick or old but spend their days looking down on Earth like a universal trashcan while counting their money. Unfortunately, there's only one security guard on the whole of Elysium and Earth immigrants keep trying to fly in illegally, knowing there's no ICE enforcement. Jodie Foster dons a Christine Lagarde outfit and Bond villain accent to defend their Utopia in the sky by getting her spies to shoot down these ships - from Earth - using shoulder-mounted rocket launchers.<br /><br />After some intro title cards explaining all this (a bad start) and some twaddle about young Matt's child sweetheart (oh dear), the plot eventually kicks off when Matt Damon gets himself radiated in an industrial accident that had no reason to include radiation. Severely weakened with 5 days to live, for little reason they strap a half-ton exoskeleton to his bones that somehow makes him stronger. William Fichtner is the evil boss who put profit above safety in Matt's factory but conveniently enough also programmed all of Elysium's computers and can hack them so he's ripe for both some kind of comeuppance and fixing this social inequality issue using a hack.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jodie Foster has a particularly evil henchmen who fires exploding self-guiding ninja stars that can hit anybody but Matt Damon. His accent is so strong, nobody within 1000 miles of the US is going to have a clue what he's talking about but that's ok since most of the time it's about how much he wants to find Matt. There is literally no other type of security on Elysium - not even one mall cop so this all becomes a showdown between Damon and the Heavily Accented Bad Guy. Fichtner meanwhile has the hack that's now in Damon's head and if only Matt can get to some computer on Elysium in time and hope the USB cable fits, everything will be ok.<br /><br />District 9 was great, Elysium not so much. Apart from the simplistic political messages scattered with a heavy hand, it suffers from occasionally risible dialog, 5th grade plot logic and a severe lack of characterization or plotting. There's just a lack of any complexity to keep the pace moving after about an hour and while the CG effects are very impressive they can't stop this short film starting to drag by the final act. It's a shame since I the sci-fi arena has been bare recently but I even though Elysium is mildly enjoyable if you switch your brain off, you're not likely to view a second time.ct 9 was great, Elysium not so much.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is very simple will be a good game for the kids. I could see myself playing it as well. Thanks
B0017QSZW6|4.0|Most excellent series....Just keeps getting better and better. The Characters, Locations and Settings seem realistic and true to life. Looking forward to Season 3...
0307341569|4.0|Gillian Flynn stumped me again.  I did NOT see that coming!  Her plots are complicated and I rarely know where she is going.  Even when I think I have it figured out, I find out I was only half right.  She keeps me turning pages no matter how tired I am.  I did not care for Gone Girl but liked Sharp Objects and this one.  However, I think I've had enough darkness, and I mean VERY dark, to last me awhile.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It's really really really good and fun but sum times it glitches but it's still good and fun.buy it or not
B001V7YJMG|4.0|So this is a pretty good arthouse horror film. I can see why a lot of people liked it. I certainly do. Great cinematography and lighting, awesome acting from the young cast, and a wonderful twist on boy-meets-girl.<br /><br />This movie is creepy in all the right places. It also makes you want to cheer whenever the little boy starts learning to stand up for himself against his Nazi-like bullies at his middle school. It'll make you cry, and laugh, and go &#34;Whoa!&#34;<br /><br />My only gripe about this is that there are parts when the movie almost makes you go &#34;Whoa!&#34; but instead, you're like, &#34;Huh?&#34; I won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say that there are moments where logic goes out the window so that the filmmakers can make you witness a cool effect or feel awed by a really clever scene. Instead though, if you take a moment to reflect on how that would have looked in real life, you'll kinda laugh...and it'll be AT the filmmakers, not with. Not to mention that if you really think about the character of the boy by the end of the movie, you'll realize some very disturbing things.<br /><br />Anyway, that's a small, small complaint when compared with the remaining 95% of the movie that just kicks so much arthouse ass! Maybe it's supposed to be flashy and cool and noirish. I mean, I have no problem with that. Cuz that would make the world of this movie that much more interesting. It's almost like the filmmakers are turning all kinds of conventions and ideas about sympathetic characters and &#34;good guys vs bad guys&#34; and children on its head before smashing them down into the concrete.<br /><br />There's a lot of symbols in this movie about fragile round objects. Eggs that break, apples that get eaten, big round spreading blood stains. I wonder what it all means. I probably need to watch this movie again.<br /><br />Also, they should make a sequel.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I watched this film as a kid when it was called &#34;Warriors of the Wind&#34;. This version is much better.<br /><br />I always saw Nausicaa as quite the hero in my young mind. Her courage, ability to be one with nature, and desire to save her people at any cost was very touching to me.<br />I also appreciated the Valley people having common sense and doing what they could to mount a resistance against their enemies. THANK-YOU! For once, peasants who don't run around stupidly and just get shot.<br />As for the villains...I thought the Queen was pretty conniving, but her second in command was the kind of weasel you'd just like to thump.<br /><br />The voice dubbing was pretty good, held emotion, and was in sync with their lips. The animation is smooth.<br /><br />It did have a funny part, when three old soldiers take a tank for a spin. But mostly, it's a serious show, and it honestly still makes me cry at the end. (But don't worry, it ends well.)<br /><br />A bit of a warning here for parents: some of the bugs are scary to look at, there is blood, it gets pretty gory when a large creature melts, and there's one point with Nausicaa opens her shirt and shows some cleavage as she lets her little pet Tito jump in to keep him safe from harm. So, just a friendly word of warning.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I purchased this video, Because my son is going to go nuts over it. I will do anything for you!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones is a captivating dramatic series. Intricate interwoven story lines, plot and intrigue with complex characters. While it is categorized as &#34;fantasy&#34; with dragons, witches, warlocks, giants, etc., the quest to rule the iron throne is an epic war story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun to play but is very addictive. Should have a help feature to explain how to complete certain more difficult levels.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is a great TV series and its isn't just about what it looks like on the surface.  Sure its about a motorcycle club and their ongoing saga of making a living.  But it has a lot of what I call a Family Storyline.  I got hooked on the first episode and I am now watching Season 6.  A lot of it is pretty darn violent but if you must just close your eyes and don't give up.  I am so glad I took the leap.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Its ok I was expecting more, but I guess for a third in a series it is better than some trilogies.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|It has 3 different size and hardness of stylus. It's great not only for m y Kindle, but my iPhone also.  I'm sure if I took like an hour and played with it I'd find more to my liking. Instead of taking two or three stylus where ever I go this is the one and only. I think I need to add another one to give to my husband. Even though he don't seem to think that he needs one I feel different.
B00FTGYNUS|5.0|I have been to several of Pink's concerts and went to this particular one back in March and am going again next week in Philly! She is amazing and no concert can compare. I will watch it over and over just like the others. BEST PERFORMER EVER!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chomecast is fantastic. I take it along on business trips and watch streaming video content from Amazon's video library, and Netflix's video library.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Makes all the difference - easy to clip on and off underwater and below about 10 feet makes a whole heap of difference
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Didnt really appreciate this album until going to his concert but listening to it again I would give it a 5/5. Wish his version of &#34;Too Much&#34; from Jimmy Falon was on here...so much more passion
B009D0LBRO|3.0|Great game but why does it have ads? Paid apps should be ad free! Fiesta Run has no ads so I'd recommend buying that instead.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  The story line is ever changing with constant new twists.  Some of the characters are terrific.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|AWESOME GRPHICS AND REALISTIC MOVEMENTS OF THE CRITTERS...<br />ONLY PROBLEM IS... THE LOCATION OF THE HEART IN SOME ANIMALS IS WAY OFF!
1492267589|5.0|Siddhartha is one of my favorite books, and periodically I give it to a special someone as a gift.  This Christmas I am giving copies to my sister and my son.  It is my &#34;go-to&#34; book -- the one I can pick up anytime I need a little grounding and a reminder of what's really important in life.  We all need books like this, and Siddhartha is mine.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it good but wish u could buy keys it was fun though i love the game a lot fun fun
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Fantastic album. Completely worth buying. Buy this then buy the rest of their music. Go see them in concert. You will not regret it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator.  The buttons are big and easy to read.  The kids love to just punch in the numbers testing it out.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|I have played this game on Xbox and Kindle Fire, and I thought that the Xbox 360 version was a little bit better, neither of them were great, but they do deserve a spot in the top 10, not 1st paid...
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Excellent book for those wanting to be good leaders in the future. There is so much research and case studies.
0805066691|5.0|I think of this book as the primer for Native American History.  I have many books on the subject but the one I love the most is Dee Brown's Wounded Knee.  He writes with such an apparent fondness for the culture, while providing objective, well-documented and historically accurate information.  My husband and I take driving trips every summer and I always bring this book along and read aloud as we drive.  It enhances our appreciation of our country's history and of these people who fought so hard to survive and to maintain their freedom and culture.
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|I can't seem to download the app and after a few tries it makes me buy the app again. I don't understand this and hope it gets fixed in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's getting so hard it's not much fun to play. I play it now when I have nothing else to do
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I love playing it. Graphics look good and game play is a ton of fun. Features a lot of unlockable characters as well. There are a few minor loading problems, Such as a match starting before the game has fully loaded. Also, I wish they'd give you better cards for each area you defeat, Heck sometimes they don't even give you cards at all. I mean at least give us something for all that hard work.<br /><br />Still, It's a free game and it's a ton of fun. I'd highly recommend.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is boss if u love hunting like katniss Everdeen. and peeta (from the hunger games and catching fire) you'll love this game
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|May be turning prudish in my age, but damn if you took out the sexual content there may be two or three chapters of content.  Its all clothes ripping and mattress pounding.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is wonderful, so easy to use, great interface! It makes shopping on eBay a million times easier!  So simple.  A+++++
1439190275|5.0|This book explains the Atkins plan very well.  It describes each step of the plan through to maintenance for life.  It is essential to do the plan correctly.  Answers most every question, you can think of.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Always wanted to own this. Now that the sequel has come out I<br />wanted to own the original.  Sort of a mini-set in my mind.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Pretty much the exact same game when compared to the version of Fruit Ninja I played on my iPod touch years ago or even the version I have for my Kinect. I can see why people hate it so much because so little has changed over the years.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had low expectations of this show, but I am completely sucked in!  Even my husband who is very picky about what he watches love it.  Well done, USA!
030758836X|2.0|Everyone raves about this book.  I admit that I couldn't put it down.  It is suspenseful and well written.  However,  by the end of the book I found that all of my good feelings toward my fellow man had diminished  and I had to recover from the focus of my mind on such delusional and dark characters.  So this book is not for everyone.
B003WFKJRE|5.0|I decided to risk duplication and get this, hoping in faith that the original tapes would make a difference to the remastered sound quality.  Just did a side-by-side comparison with Act 1 Walkure and very pleased.  The voices are three dimensional and well positioned, floating above the orchestra but not too high as to be disconnected. In the Vorspiel, a slight recession of the winds and brass wrt to the string is detected, but its still realistic, and in fact is more accurately reflective of a live audience experience than many studio based recordings.  The dilemma that presents itself now is that the individual disc covers of the other Krauss edition of this Ring are simply gorgeous, and it would be a mite sad to parth with them.  Oh well, I guess its a happy problem to have !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoyed this game to see how fast I could figure out the correct route.  Very entertaining.  Helps keep the mind sharp.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The minions are hard to control at times and sometimes they don't respond at all. It can get annoying and frustrating, but when it's working right the game is pretty fun.
B00F2362IE|2.0|Worth 3 dollars? I don't think so. Controls are awkward and so are the some-what too close camera angels. The game play is just not satisfying at all. What's even more of a rip off is that you don't even have all the turtles unlocked at the jump. You have to do some serious grinding, many days worth, in order to get the last 3 of them (which cost like 2800 coins each).<br /><br />I know if I pay 3 dollars for app. I'd want far more depth than what is offered in this. I'd also want a majority of the characters unlocked at the start of it as well. They really need to fix this because it ruins the app in my opinion. Only reason I downloaded it was because it was part of a free app promotion. Aside from that, I would not recommend it at all.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A moving story that grips you from the beginning.  Hosseini makes you love and cry for his characters again, just as he did in The Kite Runner.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|The songs are Rise Against best! By far the best. The Best. La Mejor. El Mejor. Muy bueno CD. Its a must have for Rise Against
B00B9HTK1S|4.0|I had to read this book a very long time ago. Needless to say, because I &#34;had&#34; to read it back then, I really didn't enjoy it. However, many moons later, I hooked up with this book (now an eBook) and WOW!  I couldn't put this book down.  I couldn't wait to have a few minutes to myself so I could starting reading it again. It is definately a &#34;who-dun-it&#34; to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I am so glad I decided to give this book another shot. I wasn't disappointed.
B003XFVSTG|2.0|Even with Nicole looking so.... good... I couldn't stay with it.  Corny and over the top.  My adult daughter and her roommate watched the entire thing and loved it.  Chicks only is my advice.
B0000252YK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Ozzy albums.  It was removed from the US catalog, and I needed an update from Cassette lol.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Love playing the Angry Birds games but 3 dollars is a bit steep for this one. I mean 2 dollars more for &#34;HD&#34; graphics, Come on. I think 2 dollars, not 3, is more than fair for an app like this. Aside from that, It's still an enjoyable game and those who like the other Angry Birds games will like the originality in this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved that the majority of the story took place outside of the courtroom.  There is plenty of courtroom drama for those that enjoy that, but the story development outside the courtroom walls was extraordinary.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|great book.  Had it in hardcover,  massive tome.  To heavy to read in bed.  Switched to kindle.  Will purchase the
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Great Acting by entire cast; funny, and intriguing plot.  Novel approach to hear Shakespeare's language in modern setting.  Interesting how after a while you get used to hearing and understanding this &#34;strange&#34; language.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|My grandson was 5 at the time.  We all felt very bad for Ralph.  We have enough crappy, bigoted people in society... they're not necessary in cartoons as well.  The negative was too long to support the short happy ending.
B00F2362IE|5.0|My grandson loves this. Good eye hand game and he likes the turtles. Good for kids and I know some adults like it to.
B00CM7FLZ8|2.0|First off, All missions are free. You simply have to beat them level by level in order to unlock them. If you don't wish to do this then you can buy each mission pack individually. That being said, Don't complain that it's not all unlocked at the start. Why would you want to skip to the later levels in the first place? Just play it through like a normal person.<br /><br />Now as for the game itself, It's ok. You are given X amount of enemies a level and you have to shoot them to finish the level. Avoid and using obstacles to help you do so. Pretty generic game play but I have no problem with it as a whole. I like the numerous skins they have but aside from a visual look, They offer nothing. I wish they had made it so each skin gives you better stats, Something to make it worth buying.<br /><br />Overall, It's an ok game. I played over 20 levels before I deleted it. I just couldn't get into it. It's not bad but it just doesn't have that long term value. It's just something you'll play for a bit and quickly get sick of.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|&#34;A life of leisure, and a pirate's treasure, don't' make much for tragedy.&#34; Is a Bruce Springsteen song. I think it applies here. Susan and Derek have both achieved significant levels and success and awards in their life. However, the music is getting blander. This album has none of the intensity that Susan's solo albums have. It is also missing the world music matched with the blues experimentation of the Derek Trucks Band. The first effort by TTB wandered a bit, but it has a slow early 70s style easy blues feel. This is just boring.  Most of the time you are wishing they would do something interesting, gone are Derek's soaring guitar leads, matched with Susan's aching vocals.  You are better to find some of Susan's guest appearances with the Allman Brothers, now that burns.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I had this movie many years ago and almost never found it again. If you can't find it on Amazon, it may not exist. Anyway, I love Barbra Streisands singing and she's a good actress also. This movie was a good combo of her work.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I have watched this series on and off for a while and thought it was time to fill in the gaps by seeing all of them in sequence and I am really glad I did. It all now makes sense and now I also have this really hot cast on DVD to watch any time I want! HOT GUYS and pretty girls in the cast and well written and acted.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  In my opinion, however, it was a little too long.  I think it could have been done just as well in a somewhat shorter version.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Everybody I think likes this. Young and old alike. Frustrates me but I keep on trying. Get it,you can't go wrong
B00E25RD68|3.0|Great story but the movie is highly overrated(imo). I'm going to get locked in a room for 15 years for this..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's fun and you don't have to have wireless to play it. The object of the game is to collect coins and different power ups by avoiding obstacles and the inspector and his dog.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a sad and disappointing ending.  While not as good as the first two books, I still enjoyed it up until the end.  I do not think that was necessary and it is very depressing.  No more Roth books for me.
B008NYWYUY|5.0|This movie is magical! My 3 year old daughter loves this movie. She watches it over and over again, and it makes me happy she's watching this and not some garbage Teletubbies cr&p.
B009HEMJCW|3.0|Its a cute modern day fairy tale.  There are definitely gaps in the story line and I cannot tell if they're in America or England.  But its an enjoyable film if you don't try and figure out why they left huge gaps in the character development.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Grandson played it all the time,now not so much. Great for hand eye coordination though. Good for kids learning<br />Kids have fun and learn.
B000OLRH10|5.0|one of the best movies about this country ,its diamonds,oil,and what man will do to get what they wont ....... never did like diamonds any way and this is just one of the reasons why !!!!!!! i THINK PEOPLE SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE ONE TIME AND THEN SET BACK AND THINK ..BUT THAT JUST ME
B00499NHLC|5.0|Witty scripts and great actors! Love the show! I don't generally like &#34;reinventions&#34; of classics but this one is definitely well done.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Unexpected turns make changes in this book. I recommend this book to everyone on this o wonderful planet we live on.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Zombies!  Guns!  People!  Kind of a great combination.  The producers still manage to keep the show interesting, which is pretty hard given that there are mainly 3 combinations of interactions: people killing zombies, zombies killing people, or people killing people.  Kudos to the producers for making the show last till a 3rd season!
1250029465|5.0|What a great little book!  A family friend was kind enough to pass &#34;A Street Cat Named Bob&#34; for me to read.  What a delightful true story that will warm your heart; a definite feel-good book for sure.<br /><br />The story is about the author who has struggled with drug addiction for many years and struggles with life as well.  James's family life was compromised especially with his mother because of his addiction to drugs.  Not being able to deal with this, James decides to leave Australia for London to live on his own.  He struggles to survive on the streets of London, living from hand to mouth earning money playing his guitar.  He finds an injured orange tabby cat (Bob) near his flat and scrounges enough money to have him treated for his injuries. They bond and &#34;Bob&#34; becomes James's soul-mate and the driving force to turn his life around.  Over time, Bob brings James to deal with his drug addiction and gives him a positive direction in life.<br /><br />The story is written well with lots of emotion.  Bob is an exceptional cat that you will fall in love with.  If you are a cat lover like me, you will especially enjoy this story.  Be certain to check out more on youtube, facebook and twitter.<br /><br />This book would make a wonderful gift or stocking stuffer this Christmas too!
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|They love to play this game action packed for kids. Good for hand eye coordination.good game and good buy for you.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Most solid POP album I've heard in a few years. When an album has 4-5 good songs on it and 2-3 sound like a right on singles , buy it. It is rare when you have so much well produced well executed songs on one CD. Very, very rare.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series in years.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite TV shows. love the drama, suspense, and gore.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Great movie! A must see movie! Washington at his best. I love the plot line of the film. Great cast.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show!  Zombies!! Guns!! People killing zombies with guns!! Zombies killin people with Nyum Nyums!!! People killing people because they are bad people.  Sounds like real life minus the zombies!!
0061692042|5.0|Outstanding writing that completely explores the main character and puts you in his being. The development of Ford's secondary characters is also gripping and well done. This is a rare novel that changes the reader and makes one feel that he actually knows the character. There is great depth to the character development that is almost painful in its truth.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I watch it all the time. It's funny and true to life. If you girls want to watch a good one,this is it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Addictive little game, playing it every day.  I'm taking the time to post this review so I can get &quot;free&quot; monies in-game...  Need I say more?
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I love zombie movies but his was just mediocre.  The plot was very predictable and the acting lacked passion.  Worth seeing, but not great.
1577312082|5.0|This book cuts to the deepest core of human existence. It talks from the place of truth that is at the foundation of what it is to be, planting seeds in that same vacancy that is shared for all humans, to sprout out individually in each reader/listener at his/her own pace, and place of being. I believe anyone who listens to this book could get something out of it. There is no way to know for sure what each person would get out of it, but being only mildly interested in &#34;understanding&#34; is a great indicator of finding it well worth it. I find the title to be a bit too long. I would just call it &#34;The Power&#34;. Too much focus on any single entity is limiting, and seems to disregard the existence of other factions in existence. The book does speak about the power of living in the present moment. More specifically, it talks about the importance of &#34;living&#34;, which just so happens to be in the moment, at any given moment, whether one chooses it or not. This book is not meant to be an effort of scrunching your brain to understand any concepts. On the contrary, it flows from deep within and brings a sense of peace that I believe a part of all people desires. Again, all it requires is a bit of willingness to understand, and skepticism is welcome. Its source may even be identified in the course of listening. Eckhart's voice is enchanting and drawing, and the character and soul of the book as conveyed through his voice probably conveys the heart of the matter much more strongly than simply reading it. But I find this would be a rich resource in any shape it takes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is super fun and addictive. Easy for all ages. It's hard to put down once you start. I love the graphics and the sound effects, especially the ones the minions make:)
B00EALTWAE|5.0|As viewed on a 46\\" LCD screen, this blu-ray edition by Shout Factory is a stunning improvement-<br />in image clarity, color and sound-over the region 2 DVD edition of the film, by MGM.<br />The rich color palette of the comic book/animation sequences must be seen to be believed.<br />Even the Shout Factory DVD copy of the film-which is included in this product-<br />is clearly superior to the Region 2 DVD.<br />The aspect ratio of the film is 2,35:1. There are optional English HOH subtitles for the film,<br />but the words of the songs are not transcribed. (They are transcribed in the Region 2 DVD).<br />The following extras-included in both discs-are not subtitled for the hard of hearing people:<br />** Baseball, Tanks and Bad Tattoos-an interview with actress Lori Petty.<br />** Too Hip For Spielberg-an interview with director Rachel Talalay.<br />** Creative Chaos:Designing the World of Tank Girl-an interview with production designer Catherine Hardwicke.<br />** Vintage \\"Making-of Tank Girl\\" Featurette.<br />Please look up my review of the film itself, at amazon.co.uk
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very nice graphics, lots of fun.  Not a cheap playing game, plays like a high end game from one of the major game companies.
0440242401|4.0|This was almost 5-stars for me. I love Kinsella's writing style, and how she weaves themes like family responsibility, getting what you want, and can women be both successful and liked as bosses, into her highly entertaining novels.<br />My gripes were minor. I didn't quite buy into Lexi's (forgotten) transformation from hapless girl-next-door into bitch boss from hell, but I adored how she 'wakes up' to her new life and is so impressed by it, she thinks she's done seriously good deeds in a former life: &#34;I must have been Gandhi&#34;! And, although it's not unusual in a book of this type to guess which guy she'll end up with, a certain style of shoe worn by Mr. Wrong did seem to give the game away incredibly early :)<br />I would have loved Mr Nasty at work to have got his just desserts, and, as a keen runner myself, I was bemused that Lexi's husband, who does the London Marathon every year, never went for a single training run in the whole book.<br />But really, these points are picky. Lexi is a highly likeable heroine. I truly did enjoy this and strongly recommend it to fans or those new to Kinsella's work.
0345803485|4.0|Read all three books in series because a friend said they were good.  Strong sexual content.  Good story line which keeps you reading.  Before buying I would recommend looking at some of the actual content.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|To everyone:<br />  What a great read!  Loved it!  Way to go Patricia!!!!!<br /><br />Another for the girls of our book club!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book kept my interest.  I would recommend!<br />At first I didn't think the book would keep my interest.<br />Honestly I didn't want the book to end!<br />I will be reading more books by Christina Baker Kline.
B003QSLDTA|4.0|Classic film that I loved sharing with my nine-year old daughter.  Jamie Lee Curtis is fabulous in this role, and it was apparently made before Lindsay Lohan went to the dark side.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game is fun, except you can't progress unless you pay money for more chips. Not something I'm interested in doing.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Enjoyed this series of books --waited to purchase -thinking it would not be that good.<br />After reading the first book --enjoyed very much-enough to purchase the whole series of books.
0345803493|4.0|Purchased all three books after a friend said how good they were.  I didn't realize how detailed they were until I read them.  The books do have a good story line that makes you want to read the next one.  I however would never think about recommending them to someone unless they truly get a glance at some of the writing.  Very strong sexual content.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Even if you don't get the paid option the free version alone is worth it. You get up to 64 pieces on multiple free pics with no rotation if you don't pay
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addiction I can't seem to put this down once I have started. Dinners have been burnt due to this game haha. Gets the half brain ticking
B0028R3NCU|1.0|Stopped working after a few months, like someone else said. Multiple microsd cards and multiple computers - same problem. It's in the trash, and I'll be buying something a bit more durable next time.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Lots of action and guns. Better then the first movie. Stunts galore. See it see it and what is a movie without marshal arts
B004EF65QA|5.0|I love period masterpiece theater.  This was so well done and I enjoyed it very much.  Watch it, you will love it too

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love it so much! it is not like the other games!worth your money!!! in a good way! not like others! !!!!! I have almost all games! !! love toca boca!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the most addictive games I have ever played. I would recommend this game to parents who have kids who always want to play on their phones.
B005HF1CMI|5.0|It was so good.  Every episode led to the ending of a wonderful series.  The final episode was the best, but I can't imagine not seeing all of them because each is like a puzzle piece.  I wish there were more to watch!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|This belt makes carrying a camera a breeze. It is very well made and feels secure while walking, climbing or carrying camera most anywhere I need to go using this system.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I can just smell the southern atmosphere of the small town setting-- trees, cornbread and smothered okra.  I feel like I know the characters created by the author.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The consle version is cool,but this is the same level,especially with the costumes you can unlock for the console version
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|horrible. how could they even do this? If I could give it zero stars I would. its not even all that fun. and it might make kids laugh when someone in real life dies. or even find a way to kill someone when they grow up. Not for kids whatsoever. don't get it. It is bad for kids and bad for old people like me. So remember, not good not good not good for the following reasons<br /><br />1. Not good for kids<br /><br />2. Not very fun<br /><br />3. not something u would enjoy watching.<br />that is why. desturbing app is not for anyone.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|I got this for my Xbox 360 console so I could plug my PS2 Steering Wheel in my Xbox 360. Does not work at all. Very upsetting because the info on this said it would work for a PS2 Steering wheel! Dont waste you money on this, its not worth it. The instructions for setting it up are very poor too, they make no sence at all!
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Finding Her Feet by Jams N. Roses is a rollercoaster ride of very strong emotions perfectly stylised by the pen of the author. The author could so easily have become bogged down in the mire that is Amanda's sorry life, but instead, he has uplifted this story to a level I have not before encountered.<br />Amanda thinks she has killed her twin sister and lives with the guilt in a home now broken with misery and blame - the blame laying on the shoulders of Amanda's older sister Michelle. Their mother hates Michelle for the death of Samantha and drives her away. Without Michelle to look up to, Amanda slides down into a pit of guilt fuelled by drugs, sex and life on the harsh streets of England's rough towns. It is here the author excels at depicting the cold reality of what so many teenagers go through, usually ending up as a footnote on an obscure page in a newspaper - yet another statistic.<br />But ever so slowly, Amanda finds her feet and drags her soul out of the mess and into the light of a loving relationship, but there will always be that guilt, a heavy anvil she must drag along wherever she goes.<br />Can Amanda make amends with Michelle, seek solace with her parents once more and find peace in a world adept at inflicting cruelty on teenagers unaware of the dangers lurking within every person they meet.<br />This FIVE STAR drama for adults only is so highly recommended I cannot stress enough the need for every parent to read this book before sending their teenage children out into a world attuned to destroying them with such ease.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Charlize Theron is more beautiful that I would have believed possible, and does bat-s*** crazy very well.  Kristen Stewart does lots of the Kristen Stewart look and Chris Hemsworth - it seemed like a downgrade from Thor.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funny and entertaining the movie is fast moving. Acting is good throughout and the script moves very well. Great ending as well.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love this movie. I wasn't expecting something so mature and serious from Miyazaki. I though it was going to be fun and light like his other movies.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|A little bit of false advertising on Google's part with regards to streaming from a smartphone.  The commercials make it look like you can stream anything from an iPhone but this is not the case.  The iPhone app only allows streaming of, wait for it, Netflix and YouTube.  Yay!  Yet another way to stream content to your TV from those two apps, just in case you don't have a Roku, Apple TV, Smart TV, Smart DVD player, or any one of the huge number of devices which already exist for these two services.<br /><br />I have an iMac and this does allow streaming of content from the Chrome browser.  For example, I'm able to stream foreign television which is kind of cool and I can watch Monday Night Football by streaming.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that I have to use an old fashioned computer to stream from a browser but hopefully Google will add the ability to stream from an iPhone or Android browser in the near future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the most fun and addictive games I've played. I'm a bartender, and most of my co-workers and countless numbers of patrons told me &quot;You have to play this!&quot;, in which I responded &quot;I don't have time for that!&quot;. Well, one day I found some extra time, and I havnt stopped playing!  I have it on my Kindle and my iPod touch,just in case of emergencies! I do like that Kindle Fire HD version the best! I recommend to anyone who can find that &quot;extra&quot; time!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome and a beast game. also keep better updates coming and I bet your game will get more rates. I like how dirt kicks up when you go and we want more car up grades please
B00932A2MC|5.0|Innocent escapism - love it.  It was really respectful to veterans too.  I'm someone who watches moveis once - but I rented this twice and enjoyed it both times.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Laugh out loud funny! This was a sexy, easy read after some heavier stuff.  Smart heroine; sexy hero!!  Still smiling!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Me and my wife love this movie. My wife loves the animation and I like the story and the subtle dark tones it carries.
B00BATG18K|4.0|My husband reads and chooses all the e-books.  Although he just started to read Tan's book, he is in no hurry to finish it .  So far he likes it and gives it four stars, but will hold his final verdict until done before Christmas.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is such a page turner! A great follow up to A Time To Kill.  I enjoyed the story line, the characters, and the pace.  John Grisham has done it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so great and is so fun!!! I think you should add Redstone and let me play on multiplayer but it is still so awesome!!!! :D
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I could never get this game to work correctly kept locking up hated it So I would purchase this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had this game for over 2 years, and still not tired of it. Fun for the whole family. Get it right now!:)
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|As it turns out, all those glowing reviews have got it right. This show takes its concept and executes it brilliantly.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Good graphics, enjoy the story. Nice blend of fun little puzzles and hidden object scenes and an ongoing story that made for a fun several hours. There's a helpful map that indicates where you are and where there's an available action. Comes in handy without being too helpful. Didn't need the hints much with the map.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I no longer use this since it is just super inconvenient.  I purchased this due to the low price point and thought it would save me from transferring downloaded items to a flash drive to watch.  Since it came with free netflix time...it was basically free.<br /><br />Since you can't control playback...you have to go back and forth to your computer constantly to pause of fast forward or whatever.  So you won't want to get this if your computer is in another room.  You can ONLY use certain file types with this.  It won't work with things like VLC player so make sure the file types you have will play n chrome.  (Drag and drop them into the browser). I believe .avi is the file type that doesn't work with this.  It's one of the two popular file types...I can't remember since it has been so long since I've bothered using this.  Far easier to just load a flash drive with a bunch of stuff.<br /><br />Really just a waste.  Get a roku if you need to play netflix on your tv...that's way more convenient.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|One of the best albums they released in years! Probably since Dogs of War in the early 90's. They still rock.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Absolutely love everything John Grisham does.  Sycamore Row is right up there with A Time to Kill, A Great book!
B000FCKGPC|1.0|So far I am 50% of the way through - This one I can put down and not read for a few days...  A lot of characters being &#34;developed&#34;, maybe for the next book.  But so far, me no like-ee.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Action-packed, never got bored, some parts got a little confusing, but a great movie all in all. It was very entertaining
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Liked it and I am quite ready for series of Avenger movies with more special effects.  I'd like to see the characters get more comfortable with each other.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app won't even install on my kindle. It is not worth it. From reading all the other reviews, it is obviously has lots of problems.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read<br /><br />So unique and interesting<br /><br />This is a book that will teach you<br /><br />Buy it
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|the package says that I comes with a free download of the song &#34;God Made You Beautiful&#34; but I see no website address or access code... anyone know how to download it?
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Very cute movie and true to the spirit of the original show. I loved the songs and it was a pleasant watch. Good for kids or bronies! It arrived fast and in described condition. Can't wait to watch it again.
0316044695|5.0|This is a very gripping true story of the heroism of a group of trapped SEALs and of one SEAL who made it out alive to tell the story.<br />You will not want to put it down until you read it tot he end.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|The special effects and features were very good.  I like the point of view of the movie but the story made feel sorry for Superman.  He had to kill the last of his own people for almost the same reason why Krypton failed as society.  Zod was a product of Kryptonian breeding nothing could change his goal set or programing.  It was inbred in Zod to save  and or rebuild Krypton from everything including itself and death no matter what. This version of Krypton exploited and ruined it's environment, abandoned the freedom of natural childbirth, and became too complacent in it's folly of control until it was too late.  Clark had to conceal his powers while watching his father die.  It's bad enough when you really can't do anything but it hurt more to watch when we knew Clark could save his father.  It also made me wonder how many more Kryptonian criminals were freed from prison with the destruction of Krypton to find their way to earth and repeat this process again for Cal.  I really hope he can find some comfort and peace on earth.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|She's such an adorable doll, and she's worth adding to any collection. She's a shorter doll like Howleen, and has smaller feet, so she can't share shoes with other dolls. Her hair is a little bit frizzy, but it's nothing a little conditioner can't fix.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Only 720P.<br />Using WIN 7, No joy trying to get connectivity via direct Ethernet connection and wifi on same local network.<br />chromecast still in beta to play media through Google Chrome.<br />That said, not too painful for $35,  Premature release of product, hopefully will improve with time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|all ive done is trust in Jesus my great deliverer my strong defender the son of God<br />if you you love Jesus he will protect you where ever you go hes the redeemer
B00C5R8364|4.0|Always moving.  Lots of action.  Good ending.  Plausible story line about al Queda.  I was very sorry when the story ended.
1451696191|5.0|I adore this book - and the film.<br /><br />I was in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia when I first saw the film and felt as though my life was changed. I love Charlie and the other characters. I ordered this book online - it did take awhile to be delivered. As soon as I received the book, I read it front to back in a few days - stopping on the side of the road when on a road trip, not joining in conversations with friends - and felt as though I once again was transformed.<br /><br />This film and book are wonderful - even for people like me who are older than the target demographic. The oft-quoted music and literature are one of the great things about this grand book.<br /><br />Would also be excellent for teens and school students.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|I just love David Arnold's Music. It amazes me ,,he writes music to match the movie and does it so well. He is an Excellent Composer .
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I read this adorable book in a day (Thanksgiving Day 2013).  So refreshing.  Allie's insights into human nature are razor sharp and complemented brilliantly by her wit and her whimsical drawings.  She had me laughing the whole drive back from NYC.  This holiday, I am thankful for Allie Brosh!!
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Terrible customer support! Don't make purchases in this app, you don't get your items!<br />And they have the nerve to tell our if you send too many emails your standing drops. Who Cares! Their standing is dropping. They need to take care of customers. DELETE!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|have played on my computer and iphone.  love having it available for my kindle fire.  works fantastic. way to go amazon.  other facebook games would be appreciated.
B00821OX98|5.0|great show to be able to watch with you had more british tv detective shows and comedys plus i love all british television you need more and offer to split the fee of 79.00 into installments it s gonna break me to come up with i even left netflix for you
0385341008|5.0|Loved this sweet story, and I learned a bit about WWII.  I bought 6 used copies as stocking stuffers. Everyone I have recommended this book to, has loved it!
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Designed to dig deep in your pocketbook.  Fun game, but in order to progress, you need better rarer cards that of course cost money - as designed, I'm sure.
B00CNBS40M|5.0|xmas gift that the kid wanted. price was better than i found anywhere else and it showed up quick as can be
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is hours of fun and easy to learn. The game can be addictive but I'm happy to finally have it on my kindle.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|the entire series of these apps are outstanding.  cant wait for the next one.  gabysoft has found w niche that is one of a kind.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very addictive game. I would like to say it is hours of fun. The unlockable content is worth the effort.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Because you can read and imagine all the character's thoughts and his emotions and not limited to discovering it simply through dialogue.  Good story.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A classic that I can watch anytime with my kids. Some slightly scary moments for the kids, some great nostalgia for me.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was a very good book and I can see it becoming a follow-up movie.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because nothing could be better than &#34;a Time To Kill&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Simple game, good time pass , enjoyed everything about this game . Would definitely recommend to give it a try
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have enjoyed the story line, the culture, and the beautiful scenery.  Good history lesson regarding the life style of that era.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|Attempts WAY too hard to be conversational with frequent interjections, parenthetical comments and obscure literary references.  Reading this book/article feels like having a conversation with that person who will never let you get a word in edgewise.<br /><br />I know the author values interconnection, sharing and the Creative Commons license. I don't know any more about HTML5 than I already did.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Loved the first one and this one didn't disappoint.  The cast is great and I love the little laughs you get throughout the movie.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|It is worth every Penny.  It does all the things it says it does. they are very comfortable and durable. I have been using them for more than a year, LOTS of hours and they are like new. The signal might not be as good as they say but you will be fine as long as you stay on the same room.<br /><br />What I most like about turtle beach is that they have replacement for every piece of the headset. I lost la tapa of the batteries, and I bought four more from the webpage.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Hilariously funny with the right amount of action.  Loved the 1st one and this one didn't disappoint! A must see.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This book gives you  a great deal of detail about the game on the field & information  about  how a team not overloaded with  high priced superstars can compete. I am a Baltimore resident & have seen the Orioles go from a talented competitive team to a mediocre at best team by relying on overpriced free agents some of whom are mentioned in this book.  In the process they let a lot of talent go because the suit didn't fit i.e. Jamie Moyer. etc. Very well  researched & written & spawned an excellent movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for adults and children! My 3 &amp; 4 year old can't get enough minion action! Updating is a little tricky but worth it when you get new areas! Looking forward to be new areas!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I loved reading this book!  I found myself laughing out loud throughout this hilarious yet touching story of a woman trying to figure it out!!  Go Bridget!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a bit slow at times, but the plot was enjoyable overall. Can't wait to see Catching Fire this weekend!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good fun with a reasonable amount of free play to let the player get accustomed to the ball movement and strategy for each level.
1451666179|5.0|Was a hilarious read! Thank you Allie for adding new material for the book - was great to read the old classics and have new laughs as well. :)
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|big watch really nice I liked the exterior build quality, works great, nice looking, is not heavy, high quality, not as expensive as other high-end brands.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Pretty inspirational book. Makes me want to strap on my Vibrams and train in those again. Got to say, it's slightly sensationalized, but I guess it works. Great, fast read. Couldn't put it down and finished in 3 days. Well worth reading if you need some inspiration to start running.
0199580154|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1JODNIHEIDT4H]]<br /><br />A CUP HALF EMPTY, OR HALF FULL?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />In the compilation and editing of this scholarly two-volume work, published by the Oxford University Press, the learned editors state that their central objective is to prepare a commentary on the United Nations which tells its story `as faithfully as possible.'<br /><br />Referencing the subtitle, the Commentary is the joint product of the work of no less than seventy-four authors, approximately two-thirds of whom, interestingly, hail from German universities and institutions, with much of the team effort ably coordinated by Assistant Editor Nikolai Wessendorf.<br /><br />If you as a lawyer, academic, journalist or researcher ever find yourself in some kind of controversy, dispute, debacle or debate regarding the U.N. and/or the Charter of that body, this is the work of reference to which to turn.<br /><br />As most people would agree, the aim of the UN is to promulgate and maintain world peace. On any number of occasions it appears to have failed in that attempt (as the `cup half-empty' brigade would noisily remind you) - largely because of the limitations of its charter. But that in no way diminishes its value.  Indeed the world community of nations would be diminished without it.  But here we take the relentlessly optimistic `cup half-full' view, which we believe this formidable work of reference engenders.<br /><br />Copiously footnoted and indexed, it is indeed a mine of reference resources for scholars and researchers and certainly specialists in the field of international law.  Volume I, for example provides over 100 pages of Tables of Cases and Tables of Instruments -- and with some thirteen pages of abbreviations, you're unlikely to be confused by a UN-generated acronym ever again.<br /><br />From this point on, the books follow the charter itself, its drafting history, reforms and interpretation -- and following that, the Statute of the International Court of Justice. One might have thought that interpreting the Charter would not present that much difficulty, for it does set out the principles of the organisation with a force and clarity which is almost touching. It is the way in which these principles are applied in the grim reality of conflict which causes the problems and the dissent.<br /><br />Note, for example, the declaration in San Francisco of June 26 1945 with which the Charter begins: WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women... and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.'<br />It goes on from there, and you can't argue with any of that, can you - except that, unfortunately for world peace - so many individuals and nations can and do.<br />Nonetheless, the UN remains and idea and an ideal to which, let's hope, more nations will aspire in the fullness of time.<br /><br />From high flying legal eagles and academics to humble students commencing their studies in international affairs, these erudite, authoritative, yet easily navigable volumes should be deemed indispensable.d interpretation -- and following that, the Statute of the International Court of Justice.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game and you can't beat free. Glad it finally became available<br />for the Kindle Fire HD. There wasn't another game to take it's place.
B007ACAJB6|5.0|Ain't noboby can do it like ZZTOP. Its the best of the best. Seen them live 11 times and it is always the best
0756686970|5.0|My boys LOVE this book!! They are 4 and 6, they love to look at the pictures of the characters! They look at it almost everyday!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Friend turned me onto this books and it was not that bad and it opens up your imagination! ! ! !
B008JFURII|5.0|I love this movie - saw it in the theatre and love it so much had to have it.  Great movie
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Another masterful trip into the black comedy of RED. Great chemistry between the characters. I love the childish-but-lethal persona of John Malkovich's character and the never-bat-an-eyelid yet homey killer of Helen Mirren.<br /><br />I'm also always a sucker for location movies especially as they jump from one spot to another (like Ocean's Twelve) and in this sense RED2 delivers.<br /><br />The story line is actually intriguing if a little far fetched but what the heck - we're not supposed to believe it. Just enjoy it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|First point and click adventure.  It was very fun, great way to spend a couple hours.  The puzzles weren't too over the top but there was some challenge.  All in all, well worth 5 stars.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It stops working about in a week smh it wasn't a good idea to get it plus it won't let you log in
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I really wanted to like this after all the fantastic reviews.  I couldn't get through the first half.  It plot was meandering and the characters not engaging.  Not recommended.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie it was really cute. Will buy this for the kids for they can watch it again.
B00EABEHF4|3.0|I have an older, physical copy from the library here...this Kindle version seems very condensed. It's somewhat disappointing as I don't want to haul around a physical book while traveling.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|When Emeli Sande's &#34;Next to Me&#34; started playing on the radio I immediately loved the song. I like all the songs on the CD and have lots of favorites. Similar artists would definitely be Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis and Adele who are all faves of mine.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Best acting chops in the biz. These 2 guys are an incredible matchup.<br /> Thank you BBC America.  So excited  for season 3, can't  wait. Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock (but then again; Cumberbach is the best anything ;) !!!!!!!
B00A757EFW|1.0|not interested, it wasn't really a fun game to play.<br />I found this game to be not enough of a challenge for me to play.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|My wife wanted to see the movie because she herd it was good. It was not bad, and since I have not seen a Bond movie for awhile<br />I can only rate it to the past old James Bond movies which I thought were purity good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Friend turned me onto this books and it was not that bad and it opens up your imagination! ! ! !
B009NF54ZE|4.0|A good hidden object, and matching game. It could use a zoom feature to make searching easier, but still fun without being too long.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I've given these to all my pregnant friends. Babies don't lose their pacifiers because they are holding onto the toy. Super durable. You need to order two so that when one is in the washing machine they have the other one!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|&#60;I am not an audiophile, nor can I give educational info about frequency numbers and/or audio terms and definitions. I do know that amplifiers (or amps) are used to get the full benefit of most high-end headphones or speakers&#62;<br /><br />This is a great, and cheap solution to increasing sound levels for my Zune HD, but can be used for any audio device that uses a standard 3.5mm headphone port. By default, the Zune HD outputs some low level volumes, especially when used on external speakers (such as my car audio and mobile AUX capable speakers). I decided to get the FiiO E6 because it's at the sweet spot between the older E5 (that only has I think 1 available EQ setting) and the newer E10 (that's just way too much for what I really need it for).<br /><br />The E6 has three EQ settings: a bass boost option (red led), bass/treble boost (blue led), and a lower level EQ for a quieter listening experience (not positive about this, but the third option does sound like it lowers all sound level frequencies).<br /><br />The unit comes with a mini-usb to usb cable for charging and use while charging. It also has a clip (x2 in case one breaks) that you can use to clip the device to a pant pocket or shirt or tie. It also includes two 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable; one that has two straight plugs, and one that has two 90-degree angled plugs. I like that they include these two options for versatile usage.<br /><br />The E6 after a full discharge, takes about 30-45 minutes to charge via USB 2.0 port. If you have a wall outlet power adapter, it can take a shorter time. The led light on the clear corner turns from red to off when fully charged. After a full charge you get up to 10 hours of play before you'll need to recharge.<br /><br />Overall, I've found so much use in this little device. I've owned the E6 for about a month and a half now and I love it.<br /><br />(UPDATE: March 2016) This things still kicking.  Even after accidentally washing it... Twice... Same amped volume output. Hoping the next Fiio I get can be so lucky.lume output. Hoping the next Fiio I get can be so lucky.
B00F35BV64|5.0|J.J. Abrams' re-imagined Star Trek continues its journey into the future with great adventure and spirit.  As a fan of all of the various Star Trek TV shows and movies, I love where this rebooted version of the Star Trek universe is going.  Abrams breathed new life into this saga with his first film a few years ago, and he has done a fine job in bringing audiences a sequel.<br /><br />The cast is first rate and brings a high level of intensity in their performances in keeping with an action-driven plotline.  It's fun to watch this new generation of actors bring these characters to life again, and I enjoyed seeing their interaction continue to evolve under Abrams direction.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, and the others have made their mark again, and I look forward to what is hopefully a long succession of new stories with these fine actors in the lead.<br /><br />Movies and storytelling must continue to evolve, and that is exactly what Abrams has done in bringing Star Trek back to the big screen.  The pacing is faster than the older films, and there are some differences in tone, but I like the new version.  This is an exciting adventure story on a big stage told with courage and imagination.  The starships are big technological marvels as always, but it is the people in them that drive the story.  This is a fabulous, fun next step in the journey, and I can't wait for more.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|OK movie -- best part was the airline crash - on your seat suspense.<br /><br />The acting was over the top.<br /><br />Rating this only one star because the director and productor used the olded cliche in the book - the Perry mason defense; where the person on trial stands-up at the last minute and confesses.<br /><br />This crappy ending has been the part of the movies for 70+ years and is is stupid - was hoping that the writers would be smart enought to figure some other way of ending but it looks like they just reused the same old legal drama that nobody in their right mind would find convincing
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friend asked me to read this book and I can say I really enjoyed the reading of this book.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|Not my favorite album by her but its not so horrible. I miss the Katy Perry who actually plays the guitar! Teenage dream was a nice blend of her talents this is just pop crap Katy has been eaten by the pop monster. Her lyrics could be deeper and some songs probably should not have made the final cut of this album. She needs to get back to the guitar playing girl she came out as because that's always been her.
B000IDEORY|5.0|The dancing alone is captivating and one can appreciate what a professional dancer has to endure with a non-dancing student.<br />Patrick Swayze danced his heart out and the acting was believable and felt by those of us watching and wondering what the end was going to be, tragic or uplifting.<br />Great fun movie with very touching moments throughout. the entire film.
0786891416|5.0|I love the TV show and equally love the books.  I buy all the books he releases now and Tivo all the shows.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most funnest game I have ever played for a while.<br />This game never gets old because you never know how many or what kind of game your going to play.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Thank you amazon! Was only on Apple but now everyone can enjoy it. I love this game and so will you.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The picture of the detective doesn't match since is a woman running the agency, but that was the only odd thing I found.<br />The graphic are good. You can zoom in and find the hidden objects. You have 2 mode, relax and time. I play the relax mode. You earned hits points along the way, so you will not be stuck. This is a really enjoyable game.
1451666179|4.0|So awesome. I was worried it wouldn't be as high quality as her blog, but she did great! One or two of them were not very exciting (which is why I took off a star), but out of almost 20 chapters? I say that is pretty good. I have reread it and bought 4 more copies for family Christmas presents. Who doesn't love the simple dog and helper dog? And a second part to the Depression chapter? YES! Her drawings are just as comical as on her blog. Highly Recommend.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|So many dynamics going on at the same time, the abused wife, the grieving widower and new start-up's that life can throw anyone's way, given the circumstances.<br />Really depicted the insanity of jealousy and the obsession that these sick, toxic relationships are like and the damage it inflicts on the victims that are innocent and yet trapped until they reach a breaking point.<br />&#34;Battered wives syndrome&#34; shown perfectly and the message of escape and moving on, no matter what the future has in store for the<br />people that are in these situations.<br />Nicholas Sparks involved himself in this movie and it came out perfectly, as he did write the book.<br />Very entertaining, touches the audience, moving and inspiring and touches the soul.
B00FVZJYK6|1.0|the download is terrible can someone help me with this purchase<br />the video was fuzzy and the audio levers were up than down.<br />1. return my money<br />2. or give me a better version

B00FHDA6KE|5.0|Love James Arthur's voice.  It's unique.  Also, I've watched him since his appearance on X-Factor UK.  Been a fan ever since.  I hope he succeeds internationally.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS SHOW!, I HOPE THEY DO NOT TAKE IT OFF. LIKE<br />THEY DID THE CSI SHOWS, WHEN THEY TAKE THIS & THE REG. SCI OFF,<br />THERE WILL BE NOTHING ON THAT'S GOOD!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|a really good movie with Denzel! Very entertaining ,a lot of action and real acting! Don't miss this one folks!
B001ROZIA0|5.0|Classic scenario of everyone attempting to find the perfect &#34;match&#34; for the one that got left behind.<br />Great acting, by the seasoned actors, and a cute, fun movie about starting over and in this movie everyone was playing an active role in finding a solution to a broken heart.<br />Enjoyable light entertainment and just too cute not to see it and enjoy the turmoil.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I read about 3 to 4 novels a week and over the years, these two authors remain among my favorites.  They never disappoint.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a fun app. I like dinosaurs and to build up my park. A little time consuming but why am I playing a app... to pass time.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Saw this on PBS when they did a Jane Austen marathon of remakes.  None of the Emmas before get every detail of the book, but I Romola Garai did a great job here.  She captures the goodnatured, yet naive, heart of Emma.  My teenage daughter didn't enjoy the Gweneth Paltrow version because she thought her a spoiled snob.  She loved this version, and was thrilled to see that Jonny Lee Miller plays Mr. Knightley.
