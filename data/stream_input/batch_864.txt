B0009UC7QQ|4.0|In another of my retro reviews,I thought I would return to one of Jim Carrey's best performances in The Truman Show.<br />By now everyone knows the story of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey) and his life which is viewed by people worldwide 24/7/365.There has been a live feed of him since his birth and the audience has viewed him at most every waking and sleeping moment he has had.He lives in a carefully controlled micro and macro environment.Everyone from his parents to his closest friends to his teachers are all fake;fake in the sense that they are all actors portraying certain parts in Truman's life.The entire city he lives in(Seahaven)is in a protective bubble and everything from the weather to the traffic to the changing of the days is controlled from the outside.Controlling every last detail of this vast project,and ultimately Truman's life,is Christof(Ed Harris).Beside's the enormous responsibility of Trumans' life,he has the TV network and it's ratings to figure into the overall equation.It is quite the balancing act.<br />Now at age 30 Truman starts to suspect something is just not right.He sees a man that he swears is his \\"father\\" who is suddenly whisked away.A set light drops from the sky onto the road in front of his house.He is detecting patterns in everything from his neighbours,to traffic to his place of employment.His curiosity and testing of his suspicions start to throw the perfectly choreographed world Christof has created off the comfortable perch it has been on for so long;and he and his staff are having a hard time keeping up trying to predict what he will do next.<br />Truman knows he MUST get away from the city by any means he can.He must escape and by escaping hopefully find the answers he seeks.In the films climax it is a battle of wills as Truman sails his boat away from the city with Christof conjuring a massive storm threatening to kill Truman.He almost succeeds but Truman barely scrapes through and sails his boat to the edge of the domed world.Truman walks out along a ledge and up a staircase to a doorway through which he escapes and into the \\"real\\" world.<br />Carrey does such a good job of portraying just the right emotions at just the right time;such as when he faces down his own wife and his best friend knowing what they must think of him for raising doubts,but all the while deep inside knowing something is not right and that he must carry on no matter what.<br />The movie works on so many levels simultaneaously;as reality TV to the extreme;an experiment in psychology and physiology;a micro and macro study of human development in a controlled environment with controlled stimuli;it even has it's theological threads as Christof literally plays God over Truman's entire life with even part of his name,Christ,emphasizing that fact.Truman is in a very real sense Christofs' Adam!<br />Whatever level(s)you view this film on it still remains one heck of an entertaining film with a unique and different vision and story to tell.I think it is one of if not THE best performance by Jim Carrey to date,in a more serious vein.This role really challenges an actor to have a great depth and understanding of the part in order to properly emote at just the right moment and still staying true to the core of the character.Jim Carrey made it look effortless and I commend him for his talent and ability in that regard.<br />The DVD picture is crisp and clear and is available in D-2.0 and D-5.1 surround sound.Special features on this DVD include:A two part doc on the making of the Truman Show,one on the visual effects of the movie,four deleted scenes,photo gallery,two trailers, and two TV spots.<br />This is a movie that is a win-win all the way around.Jim Carrey gives a career cementing performance with this role while Ed Harris follows a close second with his portrayal of Christof.Director Peter Weir walked quite the tightrope with this script but managed to reach the other side unscathed;quite the feat considering the depth of the material he had to handle.It has been about eleven years now since its' inital release and it still holds up excellently.<br />This is a definite must have movie!It has been about eleven years now since its' inital release and it still holds up excellently.  This is a definite must have movie!
B001ESYAJY|2.0|Back in the Sean Connery heyday of James Bond films, there were a number of reasons the entire world breathlessly awaited the release of another 007 movie. Of course, the superspy genre was new and exciting, and James Bond launched a cultural tsunami rivaled at the time only by The Beatles. But, together with the amazingly unique (for the time) films themselves and Connery's iconic portrayal of Bond were the extremely-cool artwork of the film posters and the John Barry soundtracks. These scores were almost as anxiously awaited as the films themselves, and for good reason; nothing has ever been recorded since that equals the pure, unmitigated thrill of hearing Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service or, to an only slightly lesser degree, Diamonds Are Forever. Barry even did great work with films as listless as The Man With The Golden Gun, Moonraker,  A View To A Kill and The Living Daylights. Subsequent contributions by Bill Conti, Marvin Hamlisch, Michael Kamen and George Martin absolutely pale in comparison. They just don't bring any sparkle to the films they accompany, most of which were largely forgettable to begin with.    Which brings us to the curious era of David Arnold, self-professed admirer of John Barry's work (good) and electronic music (not so good). When Arnold is on his game, such as in Tomorrow Never Dies, he is stellar. When he gets into his electronica thing (Die Another Day), he is not. His work on Casino Royale was quite good, if on a par with many other decent action film scores (Barry's work was unique in the world of film, blending the cool of his 7-piece combo days with the visceral jab of a full orchestra). \\"You Know My Name\\" was a terrific song for the title sequences in CR, and Arnold employed it as a recurring theme to good effect. His work here on QOS is good as well, if not quite up to CR's finest moments. Overall, QOS is a serviceable music score that works well within the framework of the movie itaccompanies.    So, what about the main theme song for Quantum of Solace (the film's title is not confusing in the least, as it simply means a small bit of satisfaction, or vengeance, for the hell Bond endured in CR), \\"Another Way To Die\\"? It starts off genre spy-cool, then gets upended by the excesses of Jack White and Alicia Keys. If these two had remained true to the disciplines of the basic elements of the song, we might have been given a song almost as good as Gladys Knight's Goldfinger-bookend \\"Licence To Kill\\", Tina Turner's Shirley Bassey-like \\"Goldeneye\\", Garbage's nod to John Barry \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" or Sheryl Crow's ultra-chic Perry Mason Theme tribute, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (or, from that film, K.D. Lang's superb \\"Surrender\\"). Sadly, Alicia Keys is off-key throughout the song, and by by midway into the track, Keys starts howling and vamping inexplicably, like she just finished off a few dozen martinis. That section - the middle part of the song - is so undone by Keys that it takes us completely out of the song, and her continued off-key caterwauling (\\"bang bang!!) ultimately ruins what could have been a decent entry into the pantheon. White and Keys have only Madonna and Rita Coolidge's mega-stinker \\"All Time High\\" to thank for saving \\"Another Way To Die\\" from being the worst Bond film theme song of all time. Had Alicia Keys been removed from the vocal mix, it could have been so, so different.
B001N3OCV6|1.0|You will notice that this soundtrack contains a track credited to Philip Glass (used in the scene showing Dr. Manhattan's history).  What is not mentioned is that Philip Glass wrote this music for another movie, Koyaanisqatsi, in 1982.  I was disappointed and saddened that Watchmen used the music from Koyaanisqatsi to boost the dramatic impact of one of its scenes.  It cheapened this beautiful music and dishonored the memory of the film it was written for.  This unfortunate choice added to the overall unoriginality of Watchmen and made me sorry that so many moviegoers seeing it are unaware of the true source of the music.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|The story-line is so totally paint-by-numbers, one feels that if the producer / director should stay home, any administrative assistant could finish the movie. The wasting of Hugh Jackman, who starts off the movie with a ridiculous slapstick fight sequence is bad enough, but when Nicole Kidman, so brilliant in Cold Mountain, is forced into sophomoric dialogue amidst a dull and boring plot, you can see why Russel Crowe bolted on this loser.<br />Yes, the rolling landscapes are nice, but National Geographic i wasn't looking for.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|Chris Cornell's voice sounds great on this album and the club sound is ok for a while, but every song?  Where are the guitars?  His beautiful voice is constantly covered by the \\"choir\\" and the funky beats in the background.  He doesn't need all that.  People that can't sing use that to cover up their crappy voices.  His lyrics used to be about trouble and problems and things we could all relate to.  They were crazy sometimes and you had to sit down and really think about what he was trying to say.  Now he seems to be focused on girls being mean.  The album is very disappointing.

B001FBSMF8|3.0|Just a week after U2 puzzled fans with their new, experimental album, here comes Chris Cornell with a bigger bombshell for his own brand of followers: An album lacking a band and produced by Top 40 guru Timbaland. \\"Scream\\" was reportedly born out of a conversation between Cornell and his Parisian club-owning brother in law who suggested Cornell remix some of his previous solo material for club play. The name Timbaland came up, some phone calls were made and both Cornell and the Justin Timberlake hitmaker decided to record a full album. The result is a muddled yet creative record that will confuse some and ignite interest in others.     As the album cover suggests, Cornell here smashes the old rock mold, leaving behind the scorching sonic assaults of Soundgarden and Audioslave in exchange for Timbaland's arsenal of beats and sound effects. \\"Scream\\" is a hybrid, no other word for it. This isn't exactly Timberlake pop, it's more of a bizarre fusion of Cornell's signature vocal style and music sensibilities with Timbaland's own bag of tricks. Some of it works, some of it comes across as forced or muddled, like the scientists came close to making a mess with their chemical mixtures.     There are shades of funk, rock/pop and R&B through-out the album, as if Cornell really wanted to just play around with his voice everywhere he could with this kind of album. The opening track, \\"Part Of Me,\\" is a bouncing dance number where Cornell's voice surprisingly fits well, proving at least, that his vocal range is not limited. \\"Time\\" and \\"Sweet Revenge\\" have an almost sci-fi feel with lyrics that shouldn't disappoint, they are more to Cornell's classic structure. \\"Get Up\\" is a repetitive number with effects out of Madonna's \\"Ray Of Light\\" album.     \\"Ground Zero\\" is one of the strongest tracks in the album, a soul-tinged number that shows off Cornell's skillfull ability to sing bluesy music. This is one of the closest tracks to classic Cornell. \\"Never Far Away\\" has a wonderful melody that works because it sticks to Cornell's more natural talents, it could have been a Soundgarden ballad if live instruments and a heavier guitar were added. But here it works as breezy pop mixed with the kind of poetic, visionary lyrics Cornell has always written. \\"Take Me Alive\\" is probably the best track on the album, a Middle Eastern-styled song with trippy lyrics and an edgier, darker feel that makes it stand out from the rest of the track listing.    After \\"Take Me Alive\\" it all basically goes downhill. \\"Long Gone\\" is typical Timbaland, a Top 40 single meant to make girls blush while \\"Scream\\" suffers from ridiculous lyrics. The other songs sound like pure filler, like hastily slapped together numbers to finish off the record.     \\"Scream\\" will be a tough sell for the diehard grungers and Audioslave fanatics, but for the open listeners there are some good things in this album. It is rarely boring and the toned down instrumentals allow Cornell's voice to shine. In a strange way, \\"Scream\\" still shames most modern pop hitting the airwaves these days because it takes risks and combines two artists no one would ever imagine working together. It is a hybrid of the kind we rarely get to see. As an object of curiosity it is worth checking out. It isn't a masterpiece, but no one can deny Cornell has cojones.

1416955070|1.0|I don't know how this book has gotten so many rave reviews.  I picked it up after reading Twilight, thinking that maybe it would have something to offer since it got such great reviews.  However, this book was definitely not what I was looking for.  I don't know how anyone could describe this book as \\"sexy\\" or as being in the romance category because I found it to be anything but.  There is no romance at all, so if that's what you're after, this is not the book for you.  And the ending...well, if you make it there, be prepared to be sorely disappointed.
0679736646|4.0|Is it a good book or a great book?  Some say that \\"Ubik\\", published a few years after Philip K. Dick's classic period, is a genuine and final return to form, a true last burst of lunatic genius before the drugs and disappointments ate it up for good.  Others call \\"Ubik\\" the desperate attempt of a rapidly fading talent to cash in one last time by cynically copying the inspiration that had already deserted it.  Let's see if we can take a fresh look at it, unencumbered by the past.<br /><br />It's going to be a tangled project.  At some point in this book itself, the very characters find themselves firmly entangled in the past, so what hope do we have?  What's more, parts of this book show that PKD was indeed seeking to repeat his former glories, with limited success.<br /><br />For example, in his previous work he was very good at throwing in bizarre details for no particular reason; apteryx-shaped buildings, wood-burning automobiles.  The oddities in \\"Ubik,\\" however, feel forced.  Take the outfits the characters wear in this story.  Outrageous styles of clothing can be a cheap way for sf authors to say \\"Hey, look!  We're in the future!\\"  So PKD does them one better; this stuff makes no sense at all.  One minor character strolls into the scene wearing \\"fuchsia pedal-pushers, pink yakfur slippers, a snakeskin sleeveless blouse, and a ribbon in his waist-length dyed white hair.\\"  Everyone in this story wears something equally chaotic.  Gets kind of old after a while.<br /><br />Which is ironic; for about two-thirds of its length, \\"Ubik\\" gives us characters who find themselves and the entire world growing older at an astonishingly rapid pace.  A fresh cup of coffee turns cold and moldy, new cigarettes crumble at the merest touch, and worst of all, people die and immediately mummify like they've been underground for decades.  That's not even the weirdest thing; objects revert, too.  Hi-tech entertainment centers turn into cabinet-style radios, automatic elevators turn into wrought-iron cages with human operators, and eventually everyone finds themselves in 1939 Des Moines, Iowa.<br /><br />How does this happen?  Well, I'm not about to give the whole game away, but it might help to know who these characters are.  They're called inertials, and they render mental powers ineffective.  With them around, telepaths can't read minds, precognitives can't foretell the future, and so on.  They are all employees of a man named Glen Runciter, and they all get caught in a bomb blast that kills their employer.  Now, who do you suppose would want to destroy a bunch of people who suppress mental powers?  Figure that's the party responsible?  Well, yes and no - this is PKD, remember.<br /><br />Then, despite his death, messages from Runciter to his employees start popping up in the oddest places - in bathroom wall graffiti, on traffic tickets, even in skywriting.  Many of these messages advise the Runciter people to find something called Ubik.  Why?  For the moment, suffice to say that \\"ubik\\" is short for \\"ubiquity\\", Latin for \\"the state of being everywhere\\".<br /><br />In short, this is a puzzle novel - one of those stories in which the characters have something to figure out, and when they do the story is over.  A darned good example of the species, too.  When you can make your reader feel how terrifying it is for these characters to find themselves thrust into something utterly strange, especially when they start to disappear one by one, it's an amazing accomplishment.  PKD pulled that off beautifully at times.  With \\"Ubik\\", not quite.<br /><br />It's a good story, and sometimes a great one, partly because by the time he wrote it, PKD had found a way to make us care about the people he invented.  Take Joe Chip, Runciter's second in command.  He's a loser.  In a world where you have to insert a coin to take a shower or open your front door, Joe can't even get out of his apartment.  In a crisis, though, he steps up and works his tail off to save hisfriends.  When it looks like he won't be able to, you can really feel his despair.  That's the sort of excellence that some critics used to claim could not be found in low-class pulp forms like sf.<br /><br />PKD also handled the setting with aplomb.  Let me remind you that this is an sf novel set largely in 1939, a revolutionary notion for the day.  What's more, PKD doesn't even wink at you while writing about that time and place.  The details ring true, and are all the more threatening for that.<br /><br />The problem, I think, is that this time PKD couldn't seem to let well enough alone.  It's sufficiently wrenching that these people find themselves in an alien yet human environment that kills them by degrees, one by one.  Then the author had to reach for the strangest explanation he could come up with.  It's so weird, it's actually kind of a yawn.<br /><br />May I suggest in my arrogance that \\"Ubik\\" would have been a lot more powerful if PKD had revealed the big secret about halfway through, say, instead of at the end.  Then he could have shown us how these people contend with their true environment, instead of how they try to figure it out.  PKD was no Nabokov - he loved his characters far too much to make them jump through hoops like this.<br /><br />The details, the setting, the characters and the plot are quite involving enough to make \\"Ubik\\" an excellent read.  And I do not in the least agree that his career after this was just a way for him to mark time until his death.  \\"Ubik\\" takes its place at the low end of his best work - better was to come.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Knock off the comparisons and just read the darn thing.an really feel his despair.

0385504209|5.0|On May 19, 2006, Sony Pictures released a movie version of Dan Brown's Book The Da Vinci Code. Its release was but the cinematic aftermath of a book whose success announced the defeat of American orthodox Christianity. For the America of the early 20th century is a decidedly and callously post-Christian culture. And as if a wealth of leading social indicators were not enough to confirm our retrograde post-Christianity - our 50% divorce rate, the widespread practice of abortifacient medications and medical procedures, the coarseness and vulgar evil of our popular culture, our abysmally low rates of Church attendance -confirmation of our no-longer-even-nominal Christianity is furnished by the commercial success of the best-selling DaVinci Code and its virulent anti-Christianity.<br /><br />Justice demands that one makes neither more nor less of something than ought be made of it. As a work of literature, The Da Vinci Code is neither brilliant nor groundbreaking, neither new nor original; it is a popular novel marked by the kind of literary depth for which \\"shallowness\\" is too charitable a term. But as a symptom of spiritual illness, as a demonstration of the terminally diseased soul of American religiousity, and as damning evidence of the evacuation of large swaths of the American population from orthodox Christianity into titillated heresy, The Da Vinci Code is exemplary.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code's doctrines are abhorrent to the tradition of Catholic and Christian orthodoxy. In its denial of the celibacy of Christ - and its concomitant portrayal of Catholicism and orthodox Christianity as a brilliant coverup of the truth about Jesus - the book grinds several axes: against the Catholic hierarchy and priesthood, against the Bible and its authority, but also and even more dangerously against Christ's divinity. Its sources for these doctrines are hairbrained, dubious, extra-Biblical, and anti-Traditional. But that quartet of adjectives can fit most, if not all, films produced in Hollywood about the Christian religion.<br /><br />For in a sense, however, neither the book's contents, nor its contemporary success, should come as any great surprise. The distinction between the Jesus of history and Christ of faith, first posited by the school of Higher Biblical Criticism in Germany in the 19th century, paved the way for the kind of skepticism sown ubiquitously broadcast in the 20th century. The movement of theological Modernism, once vilified and now cautiously accepted in the Catholic Church (still, in some circles, vigorously opposed), also prepared the ground for the late 20th century's apostasies and dissents in the Roman Church.<br /><br />So it is not surprising that some crackpot, leftist, and anti-Catholic writer cooked this story up. What is surprising is the number of people calling themselves Christians and Catholics who read and believed Dan Brown. One hundred years ago, the book would have been placed on the Catholic Index Librorum Prohibtorum, roundly condemned from every Catholic and orthodox Protestant pulpit in America, and been met with disgust from the pews. So diluted and diffuse is the orthodox consensus these days, that churchgoers pass copies of the book to one another.<br /><br />The New Testament teaches that there will be a falling away from orthodox faith before the end of time: \\"For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear\\" (2 Timothy 4:3). This is known as the Great Apostasy. It was the opinion of the deceased writer and ex-Jesuit Malachi Martin that we are in the midst of this dreaded and long foretold event.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is what it is: an anti-Christian and anti-Catholic book of mediocre literary quality. Read it, if you will. But should you agree with its ideas, do not try to pretend that you are a Christian. You are not.<br /><br />The five stars are for the anti-intellectual, illogical example of diseased thinking and corrupt history which this book represents.<br /><br />{Adapted from a review I wrote to Philadelphia's Bulletin}lectual, illogical example of diseased thinking and corrupt history which this book represents.    {Adapted from a review I wrote to Philadelphia's Bulletin}
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|I should preface my review by admitting I have never read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' [[ASIN:0930289234 1987 graphic novel]] upon which this movie is based, and from my understanding, quite faithfully, at least until the end. Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional filmmaking despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300]]. His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]].<br /><br />Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.<br /><br />More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 Taxi Driver]], he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's [[ASIN:B0009MAP9A The Times They Are A-Changin']] over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.<br /><br />Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us.character's ambivalence about being a superhero.

031606792X|2.0|This book didn't have the same flow as the previous three and although good in it's own right it wasn't good for the series. After book three I SO wanted Bella to end up with Jake, for he was the guy that truly made her laugh and smile and gave her true happiness; he was her soul mate while Edward was more of an obsession - and a toxic one at that. Jake was also closer to Bella's age (I always considered Edward a bit of a letch, for while he was 17 physically, he was actually 100 ..... ewwww!) Instead the book has Bella & Edward marrying right away and instead of a love story and a consummation of passions we get shades of Rosemary's baby. (Ewww again). I have to say that this book broke the charm of the series for me, for it cannot be unread. Call me disappointed. PS.. In fairness the end of the book was summed up nicely and imaginatively, just not the way I'd hoped.
B001GQACGE|5.0|Beyonce is a great artist. I love the cd concept. How one CD is all up beat music and the other is slow, relaxed music. I guess i Wish the cd's had more songs, but it was a great idea and a great cd duo.
0307269752|4.0|This novel starts rather slow with a lot of corporate details that don't seem to add to the plot, however, stick with it, and I promise it will be worth your effort. The story revolves around a very rich Swedish family with all its extremely dark secrets and takes place in the cold and distant land of Sweden, which seems to match the personalities of the characters in the book. The people are character-rich, complex, liberal, and if I dare say, quite culturally unfamiliar to most of us Americans. I used to live in Sweden, and the book does a great job of describing much of how people think and act in an underlying way. Besides the both exciting and disturbing storyline, the book also depicts the breakdown of Sweden's social system, which is highly regarded all over the world, but shows the realities of when it doesn't work. The author, Stieg Larsson, was a journalist and was mostly known for his struggle against racism and right-wing extremism. Unfortunately, he only created 3 books in the series before he died suddenly of a heart attack a few years back. I look forward to the next book in the series!
B001DHXT1G|1.0|Bought this bluray and its perfect except for the dvd bonus where I'm asked to input the serial code in order for computer / ipod playback.    apparently there was an error and i cannot register hence the dvd-rom was useless, emailed amazon and till now its been more than a month there is not reply from them!!!    I'm terribly disappointed by the service provided by amazon!!
0399152717|5.0|Book came in the condition expected and on time. I have yet to have a baqd experience with Amazon
0061689246|5.0|It is brilliant. Only a few books that I can read from start to finish and not get bored!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I thought that this item was great. This was definitely worth the price, which wasn't that high to begin with. The holder that they have this in is absolutely great.
B00007GZQI|3.0|While not a great or even a good movie within itself, \\"Magic Christian\\" is a great late sixties period piece that stretches the dark humor of the excesses of greed.  The somewhat Monty Python-like humor makes the movie lightly entertaining at times.  The cameo appearances give the film greater interest and a sense of history, although twisted to say the least.  The soundtrack is probably the most intriguing part of \\"Magic Christian\\" with input from Paul McCartney through the band Badfinger and a nice contribution from Thunderclap Newman.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|Ta-Dah being the Scissor Sisters 2006 release and their 2nd studio album and contained such hits as \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\",  \\"Land of a Thousand Words\\" and \\"She's My Man\\". The booklet has very few photos, all the lyrics included and for each track we get to know whom plays what on the track. Elton John co-wrote some of the songs and played piano on them. 4/5.
006145785X|5.0|Standard economic theory states that people will always behave rationally - they will seek out the lowest price, the best value for them, etc. The problem if course is that people aren't completely rational, and we have a surprisingly hard time determining the true value of something. Dan Arielly is one of the pioneers in the field of behavioral economics - the study of how people make economic decisions. He calls his book \\"predictably irrational\\" because while people's decisions are often irrational, Arielly has managed to find patterns and show how certain circumstances cause people to make decisions in a certain way.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|We've come to expect nothing but \\"outstanding\\" from Bob Dylan and he continues to deliver above our expectations. This is another example of his versatility and sustaining power in the field of music.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I heard quite a bit of this cd before it came out, the only reason why I bought it is because I have been a fan of Chris Cornell for many years. But this cd is a big disappointment, every song sounds the same. I would love to hear these songs the way they were written( I hope Cornell releases them that way) ,without all this electro crap going on.    I commend him on trying something new but after the first song he should have known to scrap it.  Timbaland ruined what could have possibly been one of the best rock cd's of 2009.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|This girl can really sing.   I have liked her from the first time she opened her mouth on that horrible talent show.   Jennifer Hudson has almost a retro soul sound, her voice has alot of emotion and soul.   The material they gave her is too pop, too commercial.   They do her a dis-service having her sing w/ the young talents of today.  She is way out of their realm.   She needs to be produced by Angie Stone, Maxwell, the real soul artists of modern R&B.   That said, a couple of the songs are kind of catchy.   While her voice sounds good, the music didnt hold my attention on some of the tracks.   Its worth having in your collection.   I hope as Jennifer Hudson gets more comfortable they will allow her to use that voice to bring back the sounds from \\"back in the day\\" to modern music.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Like another reviewer mentioned, I remember them opening for U2 and honestly didn't pay too much attention to them till I heard the song \\"Closer\\" which I absolutely love.  The album is great.  Very different from what's out now and definetely one of the best of the year.
0618918248|1.0|The pros and cons of Richard Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\" have been more than plentiful. My biggest surprise was not in reading the book but seeing how many positive reviews have come forth.  So, I will not add mine except to state that I'm glad I only paid 50 cents for this book which I found at the Goodwill Store. And, that may have been too much.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Didn't much care for the movie.  The Twilight book was 1,000 times better.  But the soundtrack is great.  With the exception of The Collective Soul and Perry Farrell tracks, I love every song on the album.  I wish they would've put in the Radiohead song (15 steps) that was played in the end credits, but other than that, A very pleasant surprise indeed.
0810970686|5.0|My two oldest boys, ages 6 and 8, LOVE this series of books. They both have filled out their Do-It-Yourself books. My 8 year old read the book twice during winter break! Now my 6 year old is begging to borrow it!  The only negative is it makes fun of Moms! :)
0930289234|5.0|Do not even entertain the idea of paying to view WATCHMEN, the movie,  without reading the Graphic Novel first. The book is a primer for the film.  Seeing the film first would leave one saying, \\"What was that, all about?\\" The book is quite engrossing, and may take some of you, a second read. Who are the WATCHMEN? That I can not tell you. But what I will tell you, is that it is, by far, one of the most unique books, you will ever read.
0307454894|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I felt no real connection to the characters. I kept thinking that something got lost in translation when they made the book into English language. Perhaps the film will be much better at showing this story.  I cannot recommend this read.
B000002KAT|5.0|I first discovered Van when I was a kid. But I uncovered Astral Weeks when I was 18.  Man, it took my breath away!  It is beautiful, that is the only description.  The arrangements, the lyrics, the feelings! Now yrs later and it still lifts my spirit and makes me feel like spring.  It's a classic and if you don't know this Van, don't delay get it.  It will amaze you.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|John Mayer obviously suffers from some of split-personality disorder, but so what. This BD, absolutely stunning looking and sounding, shows us his acoustic stuff (set 1), his trio material (set 2) and his more pop-oriented band at the end. AT well over 2 hours, you certainly get you money's worth. You may not like all of it, but will absolutely like a lot if you appreciate exquisite guitar playing. You may criticize his frequent SRV, EC, BBK and JH guitar impersonations, but he openly recognizes them as key influences in his music, and he can surely play like the best. He will be a great artist once his finds a final, more personal, place.
0618918248|1.0|Considering the intentionally ambiguous title, I knew (and expected) the author would appeal to the intellectual thought process in order to make his arguments. For this very reason I was excited to read this book. Almost immediately the author asserts Einstein and Hawking are pantheists. This is most certainly not true. The following is a quote from Einstein:    \\"I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangements of the books, but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.\\"    These are the words of a deist, not a pantheist.  Nothing is more disappointing than reading a book in hopes of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, all to discover a clear agenda of atheist conversion, even if it means misleading the reader with untrue statements.
0375413405|5.0|Having been a very good home cook for over thirty years, and owning Julia's \\"Menu Cookbook,\\" plus just reading \\"My Life in France,\\" I bought and read from cover to cover, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume One.\\" I have already learned a thing or two after all these years of cooking and have tried several recipes. It's a great read and so far the recipes all work, just like she promised. Worth it also, is to rent some of the DVD's, \\"The French Chef\\" to watch The Master in action! I can understand now why this amazing woman, chef and author took the nation by storm in the 1960's!
B000002I99|1.0|One of the big thrills of the original vinyl album was hearing Vincent Price's narration to Black Widow.  Price was essential to nailing down the creepy feeling to the whole album.  Lugubriously, this audio is missing from the mp3 album download.  I feel cheated.
B000LXHK22|5.0|If you like Russell Crowe you might like this also. I love southern France and know right where this was filmed. The director Ridley Scott has a property about 6 miles away. So it is very true to site shooting. Crow was good but I liked the girl who was hard working. Good movie and little romance.
031606792X|4.0|I am a senior citizen and I found this series to be quite wonderful.  It was romantic without being graphic, and was able to hold my interest.  I loved all the books in this series.  I was surprised with the turn this last book took, but it was ok.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Chris Cornell from the beginning of his career, and now my admaration is greater than every.  No one can dispute that he has one of the greatest vocals ever, from Temple of the Dog to Soundgarden and even through Audioslave.  His solo albums, however, seem to be brilliant creative exersizes rather than going for the hits.  Starting with Euphoria Morning, we see Chris take a new direction with songs like \\"Steel Rain\\" and \\"Disappearing One\\".  Then on Carry On, he took another turn again, which totally revolutionized the way that people look at his music.  Finally, Scream pushes his creativity farther than ever before and creates an album that you would never expect Cornell to pull off.    Honestly, when I heard that he was making an album with Timbaland, I was not excited at all.  Actually I was a little dissappointed because I love Timbaland, and I couldnt imagine Cornell blending with his style.  Now, after listening to the album from start to finish about 5 times, I realize that Scream is just an acquired taste.  The song selections that they play on the radio from this album do not give justice to the magnificence of the album if you listen to it completely through.    If you are a fan of Timbaland, you will love this album.  If your a fan of Cornell, and your willing to let the man be creative, you will love this album.  If you love the songs you hear on the radio from this album, buy it right now, because when you listen to it as a whole, it becomes 10 times better.

B001DDBCUU|2.0|the SATC movie finds us once again watching Miranda, Samantha and of course Carrie mentally and physically abusing the men in their lives.  We can only shake our heads in disgust as Samantha dumps the man who stood beside her through chemo and infidelity, Miranda kicks to the curb Steve who dared to stray after six months of Miranda's lack of physical interest and Carrie....well what can we say about Carrie?  In the latest update on her life she becomes actually physically abusive to poor Big after he has some minor qualms about the Carrie-orchestrated wedding circus.  Come on, Carrie of all people should understand wedding qualms after the mental abuse she heaped on Aidan, but oh no.  She physically attacks him in a city street reducing him to cowering in his car as she pummels away.        The rest of the movie is once again the girls doing what they do best-namely rallying around when one of their own screws up their lives.  Poor Carrie remains in a blue funk until the site of Charlotte publicly soiling herself restores her good humor.      Tell me again why these women are role models?
B0018M6J90|5.0|Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is a delightful book. The movie brings it to life. The story is quirky, funny and imaginative. The casting is excellent; the characters are cast in exactly the right roles. Highly recommended.
B000002IAS|5.0|Although Eric Clapton is credited in the title, this is not a Clapton-centric album like the John Mayall album where he is billed similarly.  After the disastrous Blind Faith tour, Clapton was ready to disappear into a band, and the warmup act on that tour, Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, was it.    The dominant presence here by far is Delaney Bramlett.  He's the bandleader, and is clearly in control.  The music is a high-energy, feelgood blend of soul, blues, and rock.  The band is some of the best of the Wrecking Crew/Plantation musicians from Los Angeles.  Bear in mind that all but Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, and D&B themselves did Joe Cocker's \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" tour just three months after making this record.    This is terrific ensemble playing, really the only time Clapton has immersed himself in that (Cream really doesn't fit the description).  There are no guitar pyrotechnics here.  Rather, guitars played by EC, Dave Mason, and Delaney Bramlett weave in and out much like Keith Richards/Brian Jones and Richards/Ronnie Wood.  Solos, when taken, are short and to the point.    Delaney is a forceful if not particularly melodic singer, and Rita Coolidge's smoky voice does a lot to round out Bonnie Bramlett's voice, which can be thin at times.  This outfit probably thought it was the best band in the world, and played like it wanted to prove it.    The presence of George Harrison on this record is uncertain.  Some sources claim he played on this date (the entire album comes from December 7, 1969, although other shows were recorded); others dispute this.  Delaney Bramlett does not include George in the band introductions, though.  Although some say George purposely performed anonymously, there are videos from a TV broadcast of a different concert that show Bramlett clearly introducing him.  Even so, if George is on the album, he's pretty much undetectable in the mix.  Clapton, Mason, and Bramlett are all easy to hear, although it's often difficult to tell who is who.    If you like energetic, vocal and horn-driven soul with just a touch of guitar flourishes, this album is a fine investment.
0060855924|5.0|There's not a whole lot I can say plot-wise that hasn't already been discussed - The Discworld is a flat world on the back of a giant turtle (The Great A'Tuin) and sandwiched between in a kind of pachyderm filling are the four elephants that keep things steady.<br />The story itself is, unlike later Discworld stories, divided into a number of parts, each dealing with a different section of the adventures of Rincewind the inept wizard (who wears a pointy hat with the word \\"Wizzard\\" on it - even though he knows only one Spell, and it's debatable as to whether he learned it or the Spell learned him) and the first ever tourist Twoflower.<br />They balance each other out, with Rincewind's natural cynicism and pessimistic attitude continually being buffered by Twoflower's naive yet hopeful outlook on practically everything, as the pair find themselves encountering imaginary dragons, barbarian heroes, trolls, thieves, assassins, and even Death himself.  Of course, the Luggage (made of Sapient Pearwood and roaming around on hundreds of legs...) is disturbing yet endearing as well.<br />This is a book that I enjoy reading and re-reading when I cannot bring myself to start something new - hence the title of my review.  I admit the first read through was a little jarring - Pratchett is not just another fantasy author.  At first the story seems a little silly, a little borrowed, a fraction absurd (and it is meant to be), however one needs to look a lot deeper into the story, past the outer layers of comedy, to find that this book is actually telling a story deeper than the genre usually allows.<br />A fine first Discworld book, a favourite old read of mine, and definitely one worth picking up, whether you're a newcomer to the Disc or a seasoned traveller.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is HANDS DOWN one of the greatest cd's I've EVER heard.  The first cut I heard was Obstacle 2...I'd never heard anything like it...I don't have a musical vocabulary, but I knew right away that this was incredibly deep, substantial music making, so unlike the trash one hears on most radio stations.  This song takes what I'd call musical \\"risks\\"...I mean, either you're gonna LOVE it, or you're gonna think they are nuts. I, for one, LOVE it.  I have always liked alternative music, since the late 70s, early 80s...I'm so glad that there are still intelligent, passionate musicians who can make you forget your problems for 70+ minutes.  As other's have noted, there isn't a bad song here, nothing to skip, or fast forward to, but many songs to \\"repeat\\".  The cream of the crop to me, are Untitled...moody, dark and brooding; PDA comes at you at a frantic pace, never lets go; Hands Away is sad in a good way, the way Depeche Mode could pull off.  Very simple guitar work which becomes more complicated and revelatory as the song continues; The New...I don't know what to say.  I'm out of words.  This cd is a revelation.  \\"Antics\\" and \\"Interpol\\" are also amazing pieces of musical genius.   Don't hesitate.
031606792X|4.0|Having read through the first books of the series in a relatively short period of time (4 months), I read this one when it came out and felt that the writing was a little different. I can't really put my finger on what it was. But still, it kept me intrigued start to finish. Even with the slightly different tone. If you read it for what it is intended to be, and not try to read too deeply, it is overall a great book.     Although I bought the book at the store instead of online, Amazon is a great resource. I usually compare prices (surfsets makes finding a deal easier) and Amazon is often competitive.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This is an old-fashioned epic romantic melodrama with Baz Luhrmann's usual over-the-top touch. Translation: it's not subtle and the storytelling relies on tried-and-true cliches and formulas. The movie is an homage to classics like African Queen. Some have called this kind of moviemaking 'paint by numbers.' However, that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. The movie is too long by about 20 minutes, but I enjoyed the comedic light touch of the first half, the developing romantic relationship between Kidman and Jackman, and the melodrama of the second half. You either like this kind of stuff or you don't, and you know who you are. And let's face it, watching Hugh Jackman for 2 hrs 40 mins is not tough duty. The only accent I had trouble with at times was the Aboriginal accent of the little boy, Nullah. You might want to flip on the subtitles first time through.
B00138J83S|1.0|I am very disappointed that you can't get Here Comes the Sun on MP3 separately.  This is the song my kids and I loved from this movie.  Why not let the kids have it?  They aren't going to listen to the instrumental soundtracks and why should I be forced to purchase an entire CD for just one great song??
B000P0I4O4|1.0|Just when I thought some movies couldn't get any worse, along came this sorry example of a movie.  Why on earth would Morgan Freeman sign up for junk is beyond me.  Don't buy.  Don't rent it.  Don't even borrow it.  It's that bad.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|...in this case it feels more like jumping out of the life boat to see how long you can float the ocean without drowning.  For the listener, or at least this listener, it was about track 3 before I felt I was drowning.  I have been a huge fan of Cornell's work since the Soundgarden days, having seen him live 4 times and now going to see him in May.  My only hope is that he plays more of his solo/'Garden stuff than this new material.  I must give him props for wanting to expand his music, but to that I say YOU HAVE AN AMAZING TALENT, MR. CORNELL.  YOU COULD RELEASE AN ALBUM OF YOU SINGING WHILE PLAYING AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH NOTHING ELSE AND IT WOULD SOUND FANTASTIC. In fact, that's a really good idea. With a voice like his, who really needs instruments? Let alone 15 drum machines, synthesizers, vocal-distortion, and millionaire hip-hop producers? That's for those that CAN'T sing and CAN'T write their own music.  You can, Mr. Cornell.  And we will miss you until you do so again.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Being a Chris Cornell/Soundgarden fan since I was a kid, I was really eager to check out this CD.     Now that I did, I´m looking for one of those flashy-erase-your-memory-thingy from Men In Black and make as if I´ve never heard this.    I prefer to remember Chris Cornell in the almost three hours long concert I went to see on 2007, that was increadibly heavy.    They should have called this a Timbaland record, just featuring Chris Cornell. Because thats what this record really is.
B0009X75RO|3.0|Where to begin. The actors I suppose, just to get that out of the way. I hated Renee Zellweger. On the other hand, everyone else was good. But I don't think Lucy Liu should've gotten the billing she did (Christine Baranski [who is a much better singer AND actor than Zellweger] and Taye Diggs were in the film much more than what she was and all she said was five lines). Zellweger definitely can't sing, though I will admit that she was OK on Nowadays. Her vocals are like nails on a chalkboard for me and I can plainly see why she didn't get hardly any of the awards she was nominated for. Which leads into my praise for Jones. Even people who know she has an accent can't tell. Her songs are sung very well and it makes me glad that she sings the majority compared to her costar. Richard Gere, I guess, for me anyway as he was the only one who acted (even Jones looked like she was just smiling and not even emoting when she was on screen), stole the show. The songs are good, I like Jones, Gere, Reilly (who's actually a good actor/singer when he's not making a crappy comedy with Will Ferrell) and Latifah (she's a favorite but it seems a little unfair to compare her to the others as she was already a singer before she got the role). Along with Zellweger, the other major problem I have with this picture is that the songs don't come naturally from the scene (except for All That Jazz, When You're Good To Mama, Razzle Dazzle, Class and the end finale). Unlike other musicals like Sgt. Pepper, The Blues Brothers and Mamma Mia, the people in this film don't burst spontaneously into song. They announce that they're going to go into song, making the story, which flows very nicely, come to a complete halt when a song like Funny Honey, Cell Block Tango, Roxie or I Can't Do It Alone is performed. Roxie comes along and then whoever's singing the song is put upon a stage to sing and we cut back and forth between the performance and the story, proving, at least in my opinion that this musical was never really meant to leave the stage if all they're doing is singing on a stage anyway. I know they're supposed to represent some fantasy world of Roxie's but I highly doubt that anyone would have a fantasy (a seven or eight minute fantasy at that) about the women in the prison singing about how they got there (which in my opinion should've come before Latifah's number to show just how uncomfortable Roxie is in the prison).was never really meant to leave the stage if all they're doing is singing on a stage anyway.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|CHANGELING    I went into this film for only one reason and it had nothing to do with Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, or Angelina Jolie. I watched this for Jeffrey Donovan since I am a huge fan of his especially his show with Bruce Campbell \\"Burn Notice\\", possibly the best show on today. So I was excited to learn that he was in this and had a major role in it as well. Still with that a side every one involved with this film did an excellent job on this film, including to my surprise Jolie. I know that sounds bad but it really isn't but there will be more on that later, really there will be.    I am sure that every one knows that this is a true story film based on some events that happened called the Wineville murders. The film is based on the man who did these things kidnapping and murdering little kids with his nephew in tow, that part is crazy. Any way along the way they take a boy named Walter Collins and naturally his mother goes crazy looking for him. After months of what I can only imagine as some of the worst pain possible his mother gets the news that her son has been found. When brought to the train station to reunite with him she is astonished when the kid turns out not to be hers, of course the LAPD disagrees with every word. From here the film is a chess match between Mama Collins and the police department, and it is one for the ages. When she refuses to believe that the child brought to her is her son the police with a snap of their fingers put her away in a mental hospital. I assure you that it only gets better from their, I promise.     I have to say that J. Michael Straczynski did a wonderful job adapting the real story into a screenplay that ended up being a brilliant film. I know that it is hard to add all those words and events together especially when you were not there at all. Still I feel that this is very close to what happened and that is saying something. Same can be said for Director Clint Eastwood who once again creates another marvelous picture that got snubbed at the Oscars. This man keeps amazing me with the quality of the films he puts out, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed all of his films when he is behind the camera. You can tell the man has been in the business for a while because he knows how to tell a story. Two more guys that scored again are producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard who once again were apart of one of the best films of the year, they are known to do that from time to time. Sure most of there films end all happy and stuff but you have to admit that the films have been entertaining. While the director had a lot to do with making this a good movie a lot of credit needs to go to the DP Tom Stern who made this film look fantastic. With these people behind this film how could it not be good, the look and feel of this film is amazing.     Acting wise this is a brilliant film and that includes the child actors, that is a rarity even on big budget flicks. Donovan naturally is excellent as Captain Jones of the LAPD, his smug portrayal of the real life man is superb. This is now the fourth or fifth film I have seen him in and like all of the others h gives an excellent performance. Jolie is amazing as well and really changed my mind about her, don't get me wrong I never really hated her but she just seemed like she could only pull off less demanding roles. But I am happy to admit that she did a wonderful job in the lead role and pulled off some very tense moments. John Malkovich as one would expect provides one of the films best performances as the overly paranoid [it seem for good reason] preacher who comes to the aid of Miss Walters. Jason Butler Harner provides maybe the best performance next to Donovan as the murderess Gordon Northcott. He pulls off a crazy performance here and his execution scene is unforgettable in my mind. Some have said that he plays it over the top but I really feel like he did a wonderful job with a difficult character.    This was a wonderful film that I think was snubbed by the Academy but what ever, this film is great with out them. I recommend this flick to any and every one that enjoys a good movie. Normally I would say something like this may not be for every body but this time I will say, every body go get this. Everyone in this film and every one that worked on it should be proud, a marvelous piece of film making based on real events.

159448385X|4.0|While I agree with most reviewers, Hosseini does not seem to break any new ground with this heart wrenching tale about the lives of two Afghani women, he did tug at the heartstrings and brought to the forefront the unimaginable strength and poise these women had to have in order to survive the social, political, and religious turmoils they faced in ever changing Afghanistan.  I thought his character development was right to the point, but still seemed thorough enough for you to feel a bond with them, maybe because they are a little predictable (mostly the men) but that's for you to decide.  Anyway, I loved the two main characters, Mariam and Laila, and the way their paths crossed despite their very different upbringings.  I thought it was a beautiful story and it encouraged me to pick up The Kite Runner as well.

You are only sure of today; do not let yourself be cheated out of it.\\" ~Henry Ward Beecher     This is the book that all 10 year old boys dare each other to read. This is the first time I have read this book, I will blame it on laziness rather than lack of courage...     It's the classic tale of good versus evil. A dark carnival comes to town led by Mr. Dark, The Illustrated Man. This is no ordinary carnival. Mr. Dark is out to recruit people to a life of misery in his sideshow traveling tour. Two boys discover his secret and will be forced to decide if they are \\"autumn people\\" or \\"summer people\\". They will discover that sometimes you don't want your wishes to come true.     The book reminds you to enjoy your life regardless of your age or circumstances and that it's important to laugh every once in a while.

1400082773|4.0|\\"The fact that my 15 minutes of fame has extended a little longer than 15 minutes is somewhat surprising to me and completely baffling to my wife.\\" ~Barack Obama    This book currently has a ton of holds at our local library. Everyone wants to know more about the man who will be our next president. He has had a very eventful and meaningful life.     I remember being impressed with Barack Obama when he gave the keynote address at the Democratic Convention in 2004. I didn't know anything about him or his policies at the time but his story touched a chord with me. His grandfather on his mother's side was raised in Kansas and served his country in WWII, his grandfather on his father's side was a domestic servant to the British in Kenya. He stated that his presence on that stage that night was pretty unlikely but that anything was possible in this country of ours. This memoir explains how he got to that point.     The book was published in 1995 shortly after he graduated from Harvard as the first black president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review. The incredible thing is he wrote this book when he was approximately the age that I am now.     The book is broken out into three sections. The first section goes over his origins. It takes you from his birth in Hawaii to his childhood in Indonesia. He then returns to live with his maternal grandparents in Hawaii where he graduates from HS. He goes to college in California, and then he goes to New York where he studies at Columbia University.     The second section outlines his time in Chicago where he worked as a community organizer. There he spends his time trying to improve the lives of the poor African Americans in the south side of Chicago. One has to think that he always had aspirations to be a politician. Who wants to be a community organizer in their early-to-mid-twenties? I wonder when he first started thinking about the possibility of being President.     He tells of a young black kid in Chicago who wanted to be inthe Air Force but decided not to go because he figured he would never be a pilot. He told Barack that the Air Force would never let a black man fly a plane. Barack shot back, \\"Who told you that mess?\\" The kid says, \\"That's just the way it is.\\" Barack responded, \\"Man, that's the wrong attitude. You can do whatever you want if you are willing to work for it.\\" This small account provides a small glimpse into what it really meant for the African American community when he was elected president. Obama proved that anything is truly possible.     The third section is an account of Obama's journey to Africa just before starting at Harvard. He only met his father once for a few short days as a child before he was killed in an accident. Obama is forced to confront the bitter truth of his father's life. His father was a very proud, intelligent and caring man but he could also be a bitter drunk and an abusive husband. Obama's father had a lot of wives and children. He meets brother and sisters that he had never met. I lost count of how many siblings he has. Africa was a trip of self-discovery for Obama. I enjoyed reading not only about his family and their struggles and joys but of his father and grandfather's history.     While I certainly don't agree with some of his policies, Obama may be the most charismatic person that has run for president in my lifetime. Love or hate his policies, you have to respect him as a person. His acceptance speech was a thing of beauty and gave our country hope during these tough economic times. The man has been voted as our leader at one of the most tenuous times in our country's history. He exudes so much confidence and positivity that one can't help but feel he can really help turn things around. The man inspires hope and tells a great story. He talks the talk, but can he walk the walk? Only history will tell. Here's hoping he can.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|WHen I pre-ordered this CD, I told one of my friends that I would listen to Chris Cornell sing Sesame Street songs and be happy. Well, today I got my CD, and my friend commented he would rather hear my daughter's Kelly Clarkson CD. EVery sond on this CD sucks. I like every song by Soundgarden and Audioslave and almost everything from Chris Cornell, but it looks like he has jointed the large group of artists who stopped putting out good material.<br />Advise for Chris: go buy some heroin and get your edge back.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time last night on TV. Boy do i regret having missed this on a big screen !! Like all the other reviewers I totally agree this was a wonderful movie. The sets, costumes, scenery ( the real and simulated Venice was stunning) were amazing. It's all wonderfully lush and full of colors. On Blueray, this movie will knock your socks off.  But what really shows that the film makers knew their stuff was the use of period music.  Not the typical Hans Zimmer 'helicopter chase scene' music ( regardless the subject of the film) but Vivaldi, Handel, Rameau, etc. THIS was the music of the time and the way in which the right piece was synch'd with the right scene shows that the director knew what he was doing. The entire effect is a visual and audio extravaganza  that makes you want to  a) hop a plane to Venice.  b) buy the soundtrack.  c) buy the movie.  d) watch it often.    Five stars easily.
032147404X|3.0|I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn what all the dials on my Canon camera do. It brushes by the subject, but really didn't help me with MY camera. It establishes sound fundamentals of shooting. I do take better pictures from reading it, but I really want to learn what all the terminology means.     The attempted humor neither adds nor takes away from the content.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Iron Man was a great success for Marvel.  It continues the super-hero genre, with great creativity and humor.  I would have never thought that Jon Favreau could take on a Marvel franchise and be so successful.  This new string of Marvel financed movies are turning out to be great adaptations.  You're gonna love Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and your going to love the action and adventure.<br /><br />Iron Man has a lot of great things that will carry it through a big franchise.  Its humor draws a big audience.  It's technological action, with a strong reality wired in, appeases many skeptics and comic bookies alike.  The film has a strong cast which recently went through some changes for the sequel, but I'm sure it will turn out for the better.  Its adaptation from comic to film is very similar to Batman's recent treatment, with a focused concentration on making the character believable.  In any comic book adaptation, I believe you really have to convince the audience that this person would do this.<br /><br />Besides the great film, the Blu-ray carries a lot of great special features.  I enjoy blocks of video and some picture-in-picture but I dislike Universal's attempt at the rewind, click, rewind, click U-Control.  I was very satisfied by Iron Man's behind the scenes peeks.<br /><br />To pump you up for the sequel I would say this movie is definately one of those comic book movies you should own.  Behind the helmet, and outside of the helmet, Robert Downey Jr. does amazing justice to the character. I wanted a little more action, but that's what a sequel is for.  Get ready for Iron Man Vs. Mickey Rourke!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is best known for playing the leading lady in romantic-comedies, but this movie is one of the few that she made that is full drama.    Normally, I would tell you the summary and plot of the movie, but I'm sure there are tons of reviewers who give a very detailed look into the movie.  So instead of that, I'm here to say that if you're ready for a different side of Audrey as an actress, PLEASE buy, rent, borrow, do ANYTHING to see this movie, because this really shows Audrey's incredible, God-give talent.  And if you enjoyed this film, I'm sure you'd love to see another one of her dramas, Wait Until Dark.
B00140PK6O|5.0|\\"Oh,\\" you say, \\"This just looks like yet another British costume drama they show on PBS.\\"    Well, yes it is.  But don't write \\"Cranford\\" off.  Heck, for that matter, don't write any costume drama off.  But \\"Cranford\\" in particular is great TV.  Based upon three books, the story ingeniously weaves in the tales of the denizens of the small village.  The uniformly excellent cast and production values makes this one of the best television miniseries in some time.    Special mention must go to the screenwriters who took the original source material - which is funny and entertaining - and managing to make a tale that has real dramatic heft.   It's no easy feat, especially if you're familiar with the book.  \\"Cranford\\" is one of the most satisfying five hours of television you'll ever watch.
B0016698VO|5.0|How did \\"Accelerate\\" not make more 2008 best-of lists? In fact, why was it omitted from any?! This is - beyond dispute - the best, most cohesive, most LISTENABLE album they've released since \\"Automatic For The People\\", and while it bears little sonic resemblence to that masterpiece, it does demonstrate more than a passing similarity to \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" and \\"Document\\". This can be heard in Peter Buck's muscular guitar work and the thundering drums, certainly, but also in the return of Michael Stipe's cryptically profound and politically charged lyrics. But even more than being the best thing they've released in over 10 years, it's also better than the vast majority of what was released THIS year. Every song is brilliant, from the driving, rollicking opener \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\" to the punchy \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" to the absolutely sublime \\"Until The Day Is Done\\" right through to the tongue-in-cheek punk of \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\". Even the more challenging, less immediate tracks like \\"Houston\\" and \\"Sing For The Submarine\\" are winners, standing head and shoulders above 95% of the junk that passes for rock these days. You can have your Fleet Foxes, Kings Of Leon and Vampire Weekend; I'll take R.E.M. any day.
B001TH16DS|4.0|People just amaze me. I've read over every post here and the only negative comments seem to center around the cost of the set. As I write this, the full season is being sold by Amazon for $78.<br /><br />The reactions are varied but the same: \\"Paramount is ripping us off!\\" \\"$80 for a show this old?\\" \\"I'd pay $80 for the whole series but this is too much for one season!\\" Blah blah blah.<br /><br />Tell me, what three season show can you buy in its entirety on DVD in HD quality for $80? You will never get \\"the whole series for $80\\". Why even suggest it as a negative point? It's infantile.<br /><br />What does the age of the show have to do with the cost? It's a good show of high standard, has a dedicated and large fan base. It's no less of a show deserving of the best treatment than The Sopranos. Now THAT show (13 episodes a season for over $100) is a rip-off. But, what, that's okay? Please.<br /><br />The main reason why none of these arguments holds any water is very simple, maybe too simple to grasp. Blu-Ray is not standard DVD! It is not part of the \\"discount bucket of DVDs for $3 each\\" sales you find in stores. It's a new Hi-Def format that is more costly to produce and therefore more expensive than average standard def DVD. Why do people keep forgetting this? Even if it were a bare bones set, it would still run at least 30% more than standard def.<br /><br />The fact is the set is not bare bones. Follow along with me for a second: for $80, you get every episode of the first season (29 in all) in not one but TWO formats: original version or with updated special effects. Not only that, you also can choose to listen to the new surround sound audio or the mono mix from the original airings. It is, for all intents and purposes, like having two sets of episodes to choose from. Not to mention the entire catalog of behind the scenes featurettes.<br /><br />Finally, all of this is on the more expensive Blu-Ray format - and it is STILL LESS MONEY THAN THE STANDARD DEF FIRST SEASON REMASTERED DVD EDITION!!!!! Yet still people bitch and moan about the price? Show me any Blu-Ray set with this many hours of programming, choices and features for $80. Please. Do it now. I fricking dare you.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you bought the Laserdiscs, VHS, Beta, DVD singles, then the season sets and then finally the remastered editions in the past. None of that has anything to do with the price of this set. It's on a new, higher quality format for less money than earlier sets have been and less money than many current Blu-Ray movie box sets are now.<br /><br />You think Paramount is ripping you off? You won't even stop to consider that the price is lowered because of the saturation of Star Trek sets? The MSRP is $120, but back in the day Voyager season sets were MSRPing for higher.  So, maybe all of your prior purchases did have an effect, but not the one you're complaining about.<br /><br />No, this set is fairly priced to anyone smart enough to consider the whole picture. I'm sorry if you can't afford it, times are tough, I feel it too. But don't bitch about this set on that basis. It's a good value for what they are providing on the format chosen. Again: not standard DVD - if it were you would have a beef. It's not, so you don't. No further bitching will change that.l people bitch and moan about the price?

B001GZ6QEC|1.0|In addition to having a superfluous disk of stock footage of nobodies talking about nothing, this blu-ray suffers from format failure.

B0000UJDLM|1.0|I look at the majority of reviews and wonder if we were watching the same movie?  We try to prescreen our son's movies and am thankful we didn't skip prescreening this innocent looking gem.  Cute plot, cute characters, cute robot...what's not to love?  How come they can use the language they used in a kid's movie and I can't use the same language here in adult reviews?  Hmmmm?  Let me describe as best I can.  They used \\"the B word, the S word, the D word.  They repeatedly used the names of Jesus and God and they weren't using them in prayer if you catch my drift.  I'm disappointed in all the rave reviews (we almost didn't prescreen this one cause of the reviews.) We had only read a few and thought \\"great\\".  Now, delving deeper into the reviews I find the concerned parents who said \\"No\\" to this movie for their kids.  If you don't use this kind of language at home, you may want to bypass on this one.  We found a hidden gem in the movie CJ7.  There was a swear word in it but the child was reprimanded by his father for it \\"Even though we are poor, we don't use that kind of language.\\"  Brief synopsis: poor child finds alien cutie.  Has high hopes the creatures powers will help him defeat the school bully, pass his exam, etc.. That's not how his new friend works.  He does kind things like turning the 1/2 eaten apple from the city dump shiny and new before the child eats it.  It helps him learn to deal w/the bullies and the importance of actually studying for your grades.  The movie is heartwarming. Not for those who don't like magical powers in their movies or for those who don't want to read subtitles. It is a foreign film.  I thought my hyperactive son would be up and running in five minutes when we had to \\"read\\" the movie.  He enjoyed it enough to want to watch it again.

B00005JPY2|5.0|I honestly never heard of the graphic novel until quite recently, within the last 8 months actually. I stopped reading comic books when I was around 11 simply because it was becoming too expensive a hobby for a child of my age and my favirote series(X-men and Spiderman) were starting to diverge and convalute in such ways that I was no longer interested in them. I love \\"comic book films,\\" however, but my favirotes are those that appear more relevant and \\"real,\\" in a sense, such as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight(Iron Man is one of the best examples as well).<br /><br />Having said all that, I bought the graphic novel a few months ago and read it within 4 days and saw every piece of what fans have come to love about it almost immediatelly. It is an honest attempt at making a comic book less \\"comic\\" and more realistic. It is as much a social commentary on the American society as it was through the 60's, 70's, and 80's as any larger political piece that tries to be. It is briliiant in it's texture that thickens the character of every hero, villian, and regular joe that has a small part in the grand scheme of the play. The use of metaphor in things like the \\"Black Freighter\\" comic add more complexity to an already enormous amount in the reimagined history of post-Vietnam American culture. Going into this film not knowing what the graphic novel was can severly hamper your ability to enjoy it.<br /><br />I went with my wife and she has literally no interest in comic books or the films they spawn(but she does eventually come to love ones of quality, such as those I mention here), she had no understanding of what this was going to be beyond my brief description, but she is still talking about this film with me after having seen it over 4 days ago. People tend to get turned off when they see things like the fruity costumes or a \\"big blue guy\\" in previews, but I tried my best to explain that you simply cannot judge this example by its cover. It has somethign for everyone.<br /><br />For faithful lovers of the best selling graphic novel, it is extremelly faithful in almost every regard, except perhaps the key part: the ending. That is not to say that they messed it up, they did not at all, they just changed a few key aspects to be more, I suppose, respresentative of something that could really happen. The few parts that are not extrapolated such as the origin of Veldt's tiger pal(or it's importance or why it even exists), the subplots based around the various \\"pedestrian\\" characters who make up the overlying theme are never really explained or expanded(in most cases, such as in that of the psychaitrist, they are only there for a couple of scenes and their real purpose is not the same as it was in the novel), but the general effect of the ending is still there. They made as few changes as possible, but its literally impossible to make a movie that exactly follows the graphic novel without it being over 4 hours long. It is a long movie even at just over 2 hours and 40 minutes, but it never really feels like it. It was a fast moving picture.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of action, but it does not take the foreground, but what is there is very well done if not obscenelly graphic. The sex and violence in the film is certainly true, almost perfectly so, to the graphic novel, so this is not a film for children under 14-15, if even that young. The music is vry fitting and goes back to the era that the novel refers to. You will hear many classic tunes from the 60's and 70's that simply run perfect as a counter to the action happening in most scenes. The actor's also all do a very good job at the portrayal of their characters, specifically those who took on the role of Silk Specter, Night Owl II, and definatelly Rorschach. Just as in the book, good'ol ink-face is the most interesting and fun of the bunch and you definatelly get the same feeling watching him in action as you did reading about him. He seems to almost jump off the page.<br /><br />This review has already gone on longer than I had hoped, but you can't put into words the way film comes across. If you are a person who can genuinelly observe a film as what it is, what it means to be, and what it is trying to do, then you will love it. If you go in expecting to see Spiderman 4 or think this film is somehow a perfect reproduction of what the Vietnam war/Cold War-era United States was, then you will likewise be disappointed. This film is a good representation of graphic art in its highest form, and I for one hope that more \\"comic book\\" films continue down this path, rather than popularize and glorify what it means to be a \\"hero\\".nger than I had hoped, but you can't put into words the way film comes across.

B000053GTF|5.0|All the way by Celine Dion  February 2009 brought an angels' voice down to the American Airlines Arena in Miami and we took Nadya Ariano to enjoy Celine Dion, one of her favorite artists for her 17th birthday.    Celine Dion told us it had been a long time since she visited Miami, but we had seen her when she came to Sunrise, Florida for we will not miss the opportunity to see this powerful star perform.    The opening act was awesome, for Celine Dion introduced to the Miami audience a friend she made back in Vegas by the name of Gordy Brown, [...] who imitates artists of all walks of life and we were captured by the amazing ability of this young man to sound like the likes of Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley and Tom Jones. The audience applauded and laughing so much that when it came time for him to leave the stage, we had to remind ourselves that the best was yet to come.    And there she was, Celine Dion in rare form, for she is now very athletic in her performance and you can see the influence the years performing in Vegas has had on one of our favorite singers.  Plus, Gloria and Emilio Estefan were there to support her and it was great to see them and her mother was introduced to the audience, as she was traveling at the tender age of 82... to help Celine Dion during her tour! God bless her!!! Celine briefly explained to the audience how she was born to a poor family, the youngest of 14th children. Her parents are Adhemar Dion and Therese Tanguay, both French Canadian. She praised her mother for sacrificing much to see her 14 children mature and how she now lives close to her mother, feeding the ducks in early morning walks she takes with her mom.    So, when we bought All the Way, a Decade of Songs we simply wanted to complete the collection we own of Dion's recordings. The track lists some of our favorites:     1. Power of Love  2. If You asked me to  3. Beauty and the Beast  4. Because you loved me  5. It's all coming back to me now  6. Love can move mountains  7. To love you more  8. My heart will go on  9. I'm your angel  10. That's the way it is  11. If walls could talk  12. The first time  13. All the way  14. Then you look at me  15. I want you to need me  16. Live    I am your angel is a duet performance with R. Kelly and All the Way offers a duet with Frank Sinatra that is simply awesome. During her concert, there is a background where we see Sinatra and Celine sings right along the star. Well, if you like Celine Dion as much as we do, do not miss this enchanting CD.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" is a wonderful, poignant film that asks and does not try to answer tough questions, and leaves the viewer moved beyond words.<br /><br />In late fifties' Germany, Michael, a 15 year-old boy crosses paths with Hanna, an engimatic, thirtyish tram car employee played by Kate Winslet. They quickly begin an affair. The affair is marked by torrid lovemaking, and Hanna's constant request for the boy to read to her. The affair runs the course of a summer, and then Hanna disappears. Years later, as a law student attending a trial for class, Michael is shocked to see that Hanna is on trial along with several other women for being a concentration camp guard.<br /><br />From here, the movie asks those questions that don't have answers, or if they do have answers, they are difficult ones. What is the nature of evil? How do you separate duty and decency? Is there is any secret worth losing your freedom, even your life?<br /><br />The performances here defy description. Kate Winslet continues to confirm that she is one of the best actors of this or any other generation with an astounding, fearless performance that will undoubtedly rank as one of her alltime best. Her Hanna is rife with contradictions, and seems to gain and lose sympathy and humanity with rapidity. Ralph Fiennes continues to build his career at risk of typecasting by often playing emotionally repressed characters, and his adult Michael, whose memories set the film in motion, is heartbreaking in his inability to have any joy or communicate love and affection. And David Kross gives a splendid performance as the young Michael, whos goes through the gamut of emotions as he lives and learns hard lessons through his relationship with Hanna.<br /><br />This film belongs on the top ten list of 2008's films. It is masterful.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I applaud the artists for taking a very interesting and rather large risk.  But, it appears that many of the 5 star ratings are in reference to the size of the risk (or are a demonstration of the author's open-mindedness) as opposed to the quality of the work.    I'll go on record that I am definitely in the Cornell fan camp.    The two extremely distinct styles simply did not come together (enough) to form something new and interesting,  leaving the work sounding contrived.  Among and within the tracks one artist always seems to dominate the other never forming a true collaboration (yes, I know this is technically a Cornell solo recording, but Timbaland's contributions far exceed \\"Production\\" credits).    With all that said, the stretch from Never Far Away through Climbing Up The Walls is listenable if not a little boring.  Timbaland's hand seem far less heavy on these tracks.    The rest just doesn't work and often sounds silly with Cornell as the unknown sixth member of 'NSync.  Watch Out just makes me cringe.

B0001HLVS2|3.0|I agree with critic Richard Leveson:  Russell Crowe does a fine job as Jack Aubrey in \\"Master and Commander,\\" but Paul Bettany was miscast as the brilliant, quixotic, secretive, murderous Steven Maturin.  Strange as it may seem, I believe ideal casting for the role would have been...Billy Crystal.  Only those intimate with the novels may agree with that seemingly offbeat choice, but those who are, will, and the supremely versatile Crystal could have pulled it off.  Also missing, of necessity given the plotting of the film, is the other--with Steven--most interesting character in the series:  Diana Villiers.  Dragging her, and perforce Jack's wife Sophie, into the film would change it fundamentally so having Villiers aboard is a wish beyond reality.  Given those caveats, and from one who has read the entire Aubrey/Maturian series four times and written a book about it, I still applaud the movie as a good, exciting yarn, well told.  Bo

068987474X|5.0|This book was a godsend for me. Having been raised in a single parent household without a father or older brothers, I never understood the male viewpoint. As a result I suffered through several bad relationships and was hanging onto another one when I read this book and was inspired to move on after reading about several scenarios that I could relate to. Now I have a wonderful man who really IS into me. Who really does things like bring me flowers, stop in the middle of his hectic day to call or text me and checks my tires to make sure that I'm driving safely. And despite what many male reviewers have asserted he is no lunatic or sociopath. Just a normal, wonderful, loving guy who is INTO me and wants to make sure that I know it. 8 months into our relationship and we find more and more things to love about one another. Had I not read this book I'd probably still be running on the hamster wheel in that last relationship.  THANK YOU GREG BEHRENHARDT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000687M48|5.0|Everything I was expecting and more. Amy's angelic voice is filled with such passion and depth, she is truly one of the greats today. And Ben Moody's lead guitar is a style that, while reminding you of say maybe Metallica, is still fresh and unique. And what a nice change to not only have the CD, but the DVD on top of it. And not just any DVD mind you, no. This thing has all their great music videos as well clips from a high quality shot concert. This was the best money I've spent for my music collection to date!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|This is the first cd of Chris' solo work that I have purchased....and, despite all of the negative reviews, he shows such range and changing with the music landscape.....a true artist cannot be pigeonholed and he proves it on this cd....it's a masterpiece!  That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!
B001N26GFM|5.0|First of all, Spoiler alert! Dont read if you dont want me to mess up the ending.    First of all I thought the movie was very well written and it kept me emotionally and mentally involved throughout. It is a very thought provoking and an easy movie to watch.... until the end! The character development was done very well. I truely grew to care about each main character in different ways. Both parents and both boys were perfect for their parts. Great character development was a strenght but also a weakness. Since I grew to care about the characters, the ending was too much for me to handle. I hated that last scene!!! I'll never watch this movie EVER again. It tells a VERY IMPORTANT message that needs to be shown. With that said, I only want to experience this message once. I donated the movie to the local library.    GREAT MOVIE TO MAKE YOU THINK BUT NOT FOR FUN ENTERTAINMENT!    Daniel
B000NA2776|5.0|This CD will make you happy and want to act silly.  You cannot be in bad mood and listen to this CD.  If you start in a bad mood, your mood will change... fair warning!!!!  (should be a label)  What a very talented artist, love that he holds nothing back and is not worried about this and that with lyrics.  Sing it loud... Sing it proud.  Awesome CD.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|Chris Cornell's Scream is an excellent album when you take all the expectations of what his album should've been. Set all those expectations aside and listen to this album. It's different which for most people from what reviews I have been reading have failed to realize. Chris felt like he wanted to go in a different direction which in the end it is his decision and it really doesn't matter what we think. Just enjoy the album for what it is something unique and different.
031606792X|2.0|During the first three books Bella is torn between keeping her human life and living forever with Edward. While she consistently swears that she will not miss anything about her human life it is evident through some of her hesitations that she will miss her parents and many of her human friends. She believes that she will have to leave all of these people behind, and rightly so, as she would become something from a horror movie, believed to be pure fantasy by most.  In this final installment, though Bella is able to have her cake and eat it too. She becomes a vampire, but does not have to give up motherhood, her relationship with her father, or other things that would have been terribly difficult to leave behind.  Meyers seems to have become too attached to her characters to allow them to suffer. Bella and Edward even come out of their conflict with the vampire kings with nothing worse than a bad scare. There are no consequences for the choices that Bella has made.   Bella does not even have difficulty controlling her desire for human blood. As a brand new vampire she is able to sit in a room with her father with no desire to kill him, a feat that should be impossible.  While I did not want to see a disastrous ending for Bella and Edward in this final installment of the Twilight Saga I would have liked to see them struggle a bit more, and to not get everything that they ever desired for that is no where near life.   While I recognize that these books are not at all realistic the first three at least had the sense of internal struggle over the choices that must be made, the consequences of these choices, the inevitable loss, and the intensity of human emotion. In the final book, though the relationship between Edward and Bella becomes simply comfortable, rather than burning and passionate, and they escape all consequences for their choices.  Overall this final installment is a rather childish conclusion to a series that had previously been on the edge of more adult themes. The author chose to give her beloved characters perfect, fairy tale endings, giving them several get out of jail free cards and removing any semblance to life as it is experienced by real people.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I too felt sad when I finished this series. Why, because it was over and I missed reading it as soon as the last page was read. So what did I do, I immediately started reading all four books again, but slower so that I could savor them.  I wanted to read them straight through a third time but realized I was actually dealing with an addiction.  It took a few weeks to wean myself. Like a true addict, I could easily fall into it again.  I find it hard to enjoy other books now that Twilight has set such high standards for me. This says a lot, because I am an avid reader.  During my recovery, the only book I could bear to read (lest I forget a moment of the joy of Twilight) was S.M.'s book \\"the Host\\".  It was a great book and helped take the edge of my withdrawal pains.  I am proud to say that I am in recovery, but with the dvd coming out, I am sure I will be off the wagon again soon.      Book 4 was amazing and a wonderful way to tie everything together and show the growth of Bella and Edward.  I only hope that S.M. comes back to tell stories about Nessie and Jacob and the family.      I am 45 and was never able to have my own children so I was thrilled that Bella was spared that agony.  I am also an optimist.  I am ok with happy endings.  They certainly fought hard for every win they had.  I do admit that I have loved books before and when they ended up brutally sad, I felt betrayed and wished I hadn't even read them.  I felt none of that here. It ended beautifully.  Thank you Stephanie Meyers.
0553381687|3.0|Why am I writing a review when 1,500 others have already done so.  Vanity perhaps.  I want to offer a friendly word of warning that others may have neglected.<br /><br />If you are the type of reader who gets hooked into a series and must read on, you may want to pass on this first book, though it is a good read.  Here's why:<br /><br />Each book of this series is less satisfying than the last.  The writing is often superb but the author provides very few satisfying conclusions.  At first I thought that he was building to great moments, but as I finish book four, I realize that he's been purposely stringing me along.<br /><br />Yes, I'm laying a charge against the man.<br /><br />He resorts to other devices that should be beneath a writer of his abilities.  For example, he will write that a central child character has been brutally murdered, only to reveal a hundred pages later that such was not the case.  We learn later that the powerful knight hit the child in the back of her head with \\"the flat\\" of his axe rather than the blade, and so she's fine now.  I call such tricks cheap. And they breed distrust in the storyteller.<br /><br />In subsequent books the author also adopts the point of view of characters who were villains in the first book.  Jaimie, an unrepentant child murderer, becomes a sympathetic hero, not just in his own eyes, but seemingly from the storyteller's perspective, too.  This is unrealistic and somewhat disturbing.<br /><br />And when the author chooses to write a chapter from an obscure character's POV, as he does more frequently in later books, the reader finds himself uninterested in what befalls that protagonist.  Like others who have posted here, I found myself skimming and skipping, which I almost never do.<br /><br />I would have given the first book of the series 4.5 stars before I read three more.  Now I feel it deserves only 3.3.<br /><br />Book one is a nicely written pleasant journey most of the time, but if you succumb to the suspense, as Martin intends, you will likely be frustrated and disappointed yet unable to extricate yourself from the series.<br /><br />By the way, according to Barnes & Noble, the next book, \\"A Dance of Dragons,\\" is not due out until 2013.  This is the book that the author said was really only the second half of an over-long book four, and a book he said would be on the shelves in 2006.inted yet unable to extricate yourself from the series.

B001QB9H10|4.0|This movie has large shoes to fill as the first two redefined action movies.  The action was outstanding.  The story wasn't good at all.  It wasn't until almost the end of the movie when we figured out what was going on plotwise.  Also, Jason statham's attempt at comedy isn't a good one.  We see at the beginning The Transporter fishing.  So many things just kill the character.  I found myself enjoying the movie, but it's nothing great.

His marriage failed and he struggled  with all of the decisions in his life including the marriage. In the end he seemed very shallow and reconciled to her ending her own life. His chracter was detached from  the realities of life in post war Germany.At such a young age he couldnt be held responsible for what went on but could have been  less detached from the cruelties and agony of the concentration camp detainees . Moved me greatly and was very sad.

A great read that works great on the Kindle for iPhone with its short chapters and nice length.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Micky Rourke gives an amazing performance as Randy the Ram Robinson, a washed-up wrestler from the 1980s. The irony is that Mickey Rourke was the actor who had a promising future but slipped along the way. He has made his comeback playing a washed-up wrestler who works part-time in a supermarket deli. The violence might be too much for some of us but it didn't take away from the film itself. In fact, Marisa Tomei plays an exotic dancer/stripper who gives lap dances and whose character Cassidy is also past her prime working at a tawdry nightclub where the Ram visits regularly. The friendship between them is touching since they have so much in common. Tomei deserved her Oscar nomination. On the streets, Tomei's Cassidy looks like everybody else. Ram tries to connect with his estranged daughter, Stephanie, but I found that relationship to need more explanation. Of course, we know that she's been out of his life and she resents him for that but we don't know about her mother and that relationship with Ram. It would have connected the dots. But this film is really about Ram's comeback despite possibly risking his life. Since I live in New Jersey, I found it interesting to see the sights and see New Jersey being portrayed as more than mobsters and crooked politicians for a change.
006135323X|3.0|Excerpt:<br />\\"PREDICTABLY IRRATIONAL by Dan Ariely<br />Excerpted from Chapter 3 - The Cost of Zero Cost<br />Have you ever grabbed for a coupon offering a free! package of coffee beans--even though you don't drink coffee and don't even have a machine with which to brew it? What about all those free! extra helpings you piled on your plate at a buffet, even though your stomach had already started to ache from all the food you had consumed? And what about the worthless free! stuff you've accumulated--the promotional T-shirt from the radio station, the teddy bear that came with the box of Valentine chocolates, the magnetic calendar your insurance agent sends you each year?<br />It's no secret that getting something free feels very good. Zero is not just another price, it turns out. Zero is an emotional hot button--a source of irrational excitement. Would you buy something if it were discounted from 50 cents to 20 cents? Maybe. Would you buy it if it were discounted from 50 cents to two cents? Maybe. Would you grab it if it were discounted from 50 cents to zero? You bet!<br />What is it about zero cost that we find so irresistible? Why does free! make us so happy? After all, free! can lead us into trouble: things that we would never consider purchasing become incredibly appealing as soon as they are free! For instance, have you ever gathered up free pencils, key chains, and note pads at a conference, even though you'd have to carry them home and would only throw most of them away? Have you ever stood in line for a very long time (too long), just to get a free cone of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Or have you bought two of a product that you wouldn't have chosen in the first place, just to get the third one for free?<br />What is it about free! that's so enticing? Why do we have an irrational urge to jump for a free! item, even when it's not what we really want?<br />I believe the answer is this. Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is free! we forget the downside. Free! gives us such an emotional charge<br />that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is. Why? I think it's because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. The real allure of free! is tied to this fear. There's no visible possibility of loss when we choose a free! item (it's free). But suppose we choose the item that's not free. Uh- oh, now there's a risk of having made a poor decision--the possibility of a loss. And so, given the choice, we go for what is free.\\"<br /><br />I would take the free coffee beans. I like coffee. If I didn't have a coffee maker I would give the beans away. I wouldn't stand in line for free ice cream cone. Heck, I wouldn't even drive there unless it was on the way. And I wouldn't buy two of something to get a third one free. Well, maybe something like gold bullion.<br /><br />Most people do according to this deep analysis that comes in Chapter 3 because there is no downside and people are risk-averse. They don't want to make a mistake and you can't make a mistake with free. I rather think that people like free stuff because it's free.<br /><br />Now let's examine the motivations of the author in offering a free excerpt. Maybe he thinks I'll like the excerpt and buy the book. Well then, give me enough to make that decision -- at least an entire chapter. I don't know why Amazon doesn't give the first half of their books to their Kindle customers. Who's going to invest in reading half a book and not finish it if it's any good. They are going to buy the book. On the other hand if the book is not to their liking they are not going to buy it. Amazon doesn't have an interest in selling people books they don't like.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire was a film that came out of nowhere and became a sensation for the all right reasons. After all, the story of Jamal, an Indian muslim orphan from the slums, becomes a contestant on the Indian hit game show version of \\"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?\\" but for not the obvious reasons. He is treated with suspicion by authorities and even the game show host played brilliantly of Anil Kapoor, one of Bollywood's biggest stars. The young man played by three different actors at different stages seamingly blend into one character of Jamal Patel as his brother and another female orphan. With each question, Jamal remembers something to help him answer and that's the brilliance. When he explains his history, he comes across so natural rather than intensive. There is a lot of drama and flashbacks to his life in only 18 years. In only 2 hours, you are transformed into becoming one of his supporters and win or lose. You are rooting for him all the way to get the money and the girl. You laugh, you cry, and you will remember this film for a long time. I'm not much of a fan of Bollywood films but this film is a keeper. I keep telling people to see it at least once and stay to the end.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|This is the first monitor arm I have purchased.  I got it to mount an HP w2007 because the stock base on that monitor only has tilt adjustments.  The freedom to sit back with my feet on the desk and have the monitor hanging in mid-air over my lap while I read a pdf is wonderful.      This item was easy to set up.  It comes assembled with a tool-less clamp base which can be traded out for a screw-through-hole base in case you don't want to mount it to an edge.  The joints are tightened close to what you will need when you adjust your monitor.  It holds the little 20\\" monitor just fine and it seems solid enough to hold something heavier.      As far as size, in my mind I pictured it bigger, but the two joints together can bring the screen all the way from the back of my desk to the front, which is fine.  The swivel (from portrait to landscape) works beautifully and that's largely why I got it.  The cable holders are cheap.  I couldn't keep the one together on the upper arm.  But the lower cable holder does just fine for keeping the cables up and out of the way.  The height adjustment is o.k..  It's a round button to push in and then you adjust the height by moving the monitor up and down and releasing the button at the desired height.  The yaw ( rotate right or left) works just fine at the base of the lower arm, but the yaw near the monitor on the upper arm is odd because it's plane of movement tilts as the arm is raised or lowered.  The pitch works just fine at any angle.  So, it is very easy to adjust closer/further, to the right, to the left, and portrait to landscape, but it is a little more complicated to adjust vertically or fine-tune the yaw of the monitor.      The construction is solid feeling and the hardware looks like it will last well too. I would recommend this as a reasonably cost-conscious way to gain flexibility with their monitor and clear space on their desk if they currently have a monitor with limited adjustments.  It looks good too!
B00008R9KF|4.0|My Beautiful Laundrette is directed by Stephen Frears, the director behind one of my favorite films (Dangerous Liaisons) and several other good ones (High Fidelity, Mary Reilly, and The Queen to name a few). The film features an Oscar-nominated script by Hanif Kureishi and an early, stand-out performance by two-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor, My Left Foot & There Will Be Blood).    The setting is a racially-tense neighborhood in Thatcher-ear London. Omar (Gordon Warnecke) is a young Pakistani who starts working for his uncle washing cars. Omar is soon allowed to run his uncle's shabby, run-down laundrette. It's around this time that Omar encounters childhood friend Johnny (Day-Lewis), a hood who runs with a small group of fascists who enjoy provoking racial violence. Omar hires Johnny to help up him fix up the laundrette with drug money he has stolen from his uncle's associate Salim.     It is soon revealed that Omar and Johnny are gay...And Salim discovers where his drugs went and Omar opens more laundrettes. None of these things will surprise you. They weren't meant to admittedly, but what this entire film seems to be is a rather complicated story told as a standard in a 94-minute timeframe.     The film's script follows a very linear plot. This, juxtaposed with the unnecessary changes in tone, makes the screenplay the weakest element of the film. It's a film that wants to explore themes of social and ethnic classes, as well as sexuality, but it never really says much on the subject. As if Kureishi knew these were important issues but didn't know why. It doesn't work as an exploration of these subjects and it's a rather complex story that had been formatted into a much more simplistic one. It made me question what exactly the screenwriter's intention was.    Beyond that, it's not particularly well-made. It has very dated near-grainy cinematography and some synthesizer music used as the score, which seems inappropriate in some of the scenes.Many films directed by Frears seem very dated due largely in part to his use of cinematography. \\"Mary Reilly\\" looks and feels much older than 1996 (this has nothing to do with its timeframe) and \\"The Queen\\" looks to glossy and done-up (another Miramax film called \\"Casanova\\" suffered the same problem).     If anything, I can see My Beautiful Laundrette causing a stir in 1985 when it was released especially with its depiction of Omar and Johnny's homosexual relationship. This brings me to my next subject...    This is not a gay-themed movie such as Brokeback Mountain. While \\"Brokeback\\" has a central theme of homosexuality and its very plot relies on it, My Beautiful Laundrette does not. It is not about two homosexual men but rather, two men who happen to be homosexual. If all the scenes of Omar and Johnny being intimate were removed from the film, it would have little or no effect on the overall story.    The best, most consistent thing about the film is the subtle, moving performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. This is not Bill the Butcher or Daniel Plainview; this is Day-Lewis in neutral. It's a performance that shows off his range as an actor and his ability to completely immerse himself in a role, big or small. He's one of the few well-known actors who walk on-screen and allow you to instantly identify the character rather than the actor. I can imagine Day-Lewis viewing that as a compliment of the highest order.    My Beautiful Laundrette is not a powerful, profound, or particularly moving film. It is neither a failure nor any real kind of achievement. It does not require an audience nor is it undeserving of one. It's simply there. Neither good nor bad, neither entertaining nor boring, but available...Should you decide to watch it.    B-    Side-Note: Hanif Kureishi did write the screenplay for one of my favorite movies of the last few years, \\"Venus\\" with Peter O'Toole. This is a film that wanted to explore a particular subject (in this case, death, among other things)and succeeded.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|It's good to see an artist who isn't content to do the same thing over and over without taking risks. I don't know if Scream will go down like Sgt.

Good for him.

I knew SOMETHING BLUE was going to be told from Darcy's prosepective and I almost didn't buy it.  I'm SO glad that I did.  It FAR surpassed any expectations I had.  I found myself unable to put it down but still hating Darcy throughout the book.  The ending couldn't have been any better (I won't ruin it for any potential buyers).  I didn't want it to end.  She really does go thru a transformation thru the book and it will inspire you to be a better \\"you\\".

But how is the actual movie? its a great pice of filmaking and a very difficult one to make. the script is a little bit convulted and that is the one thing that prevents this one to be a truly great movie.  The story revolves around an oil searcher at the begining of the century and the journey into madness. sons, brothers, friends, are not what they seem and i belive that, while is a good film it relies 95% on the performance o D.D. Lewis. a sure bet to the oscar (wich he won)  D. Lewis is supported by a very solid cast and the direction takes the best of what it disposes.  as for the visuals on blu-ray, is a huge leap from the DVD while not in the category of demo disc.  if you like movies not that commercial, and you enjoy a great performance, you will, as i, forgive the flaws of the movie and admire the work of a true monster, this one histrionic.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We tried both the rear mounted child seat as well as this seat and found this style to be so much more comfortable to ride with . I am on the small side and always felt unstable with my child on the back of the bike. With this seat I am so much more comfortable riding that we go all the time! You are able to interact with your child much more and can hear what they are saying when they point out things along the way.We don't have the LTD version but I am thinking that I might just invest in it for my husband's bike because we have been so happy with this product!
B001GAPC1K|4.0|So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.    And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.    Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it´s source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.     the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.    I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.    Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, andcount how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.
0385340990|5.0|This book was chosen for a book club that I'm in and I loved it! I travelled thru Europe about ten years ago and now I wish I had stopped to check out the Channel Islands - I guess this gives me an excuse to go back (as if I needed one). It's a great book - very cleverly written via letters with characters whom you'll grow to love.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|I write this review as a fan of good music and an enthusiastic fan of Chris Cornell since i can remember being old enough to buy Cd's with my own money....     PLease note, whenever i use the word YOU in this review I'm referring to anyone who gave this album a 1 star review.  This is not to say that you're not allowed to NOT like this album, every one's entitled to an opinion, but i read all of the 1 star reviews and not one had a compelling point or reason behind them, and you're only entitled to an opinion if you can back it up with a reasonable explanation.  To give an example of my mindset at the time of this writing, an acceptable review would even have been: \\"hi my name is bob and i didn't enjoy this music\\"     I love this album.  For all of you morons who brush this off or say you hate it because it's not soundgarden, I say GOOD, you don't deserve to listen to it. I'm glad you hated it because it's not soundgarden.  If you went in expecting soundgarden, you're an idiot.......and here are some reasons why you're an idiot:     -first, nowhere, anywhere on the packaging does the cd indicate that if you liked soundgarden, then you will love this cd.      -Second, every ounce of press surrounding this album has indicated what type of music was going to be featured on it, so if you say you were looking forward to it and were disappointed upon hearing it- you obviously heard what the album was going to be like, then heard the THREE singles that have gotten radio play since November, and THEN..... you put on your moron blinders that transported your tiny brain back to October 1991 as you anxiously awaited the release of badmotorfinger.    -Third, you probably still only listen to every album you bought between 1989 and  1996 and won't open your ears up to anything really new.  I bet you still wear your \\"Kurt Cobain is dead\\" t shirts and complain about how all new music sucks, and Kurt was murdered... here's a couple facts for you to deal with: soundgarden's over; nirvana is over; Kurt Cobain wasn't even the best songwriter in his own band, he killed himself, and the music world was better for it; pearl jam is not, and hasn't BEEN a good band since the release of \\"Ten\\"; and NO, you shouldn't be wearing a plaid flanel shirt if you're not some sort of lumberjack, or on the cover of super-absorbent napkin products.    Back to the actual matter at hand, Scream.  This music on this album, especially when listened to on the proper system, completely envelops you and owns you from start to end.  Each song flows seemlessly to the next yet each is its own animal, never feeling repetitive or contrived.  Timbaland's beats and cornell's voice were meant to find eachother, and for this reviewer: it is a very, happy marriage.
076790592X|4.0|I thought this book was a bit slow reading, but it was touching and certainly thought provoking. It's a record of conversations between a man and his former college professor who he admired and became friends with when the professor was dying from ALS disease. The professor shared his feelings about a variety of subjects, including how he felt about dying and becoming like a baby again, helpless. It was sort of depressing, but yet had enough good philosophical thoughts to keep me reading. The one I liked best is that he said \\"Love Goes On.\\" When the professor was asked if he worried about being forgotten when he died, his answer was, \\"I don't think I will be. I've got so many people who have been involved with me in close, intimate ways. And love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone.\\" I agree with this because the loved ones I've lost are still alive in my thoughts.
B001ED7C58|4.0|After reading Twilight I was bitten and had to read the rest of the Saga. And heck, SM's playlists are so great, why not try the Twilight movie soundtrack since I plan to watch the movie once its released on DVD? The soundtrack is great and perfect. I've been listening to it every moment I'm in my car for the past 6 weeks while daydreaming about Edward and Bella. Hope I don't get in a car accident, unless Edward can save me!  ENJOY!  -Twilight Addict

B00001OH7P|5.0|This disk features one of the all time great musical line ups.  Bowie created the personna of Ziggy Stardust, with the band The Spiders From Mars, and they played the part perfectly.  Glam costumes and make up created because of David's interest in kabuki theatre and space travel helped create an unusual live show, but the band's musicianship was second to none.  Mick Ronson, later of Ian Hunter Band and Rolling Thunder Review fame, is the perfect sidekick to Bowie's androgeny, and a great guitarist/arranger.  This release is full of great songs from start to finish, with rockers like \\"Moonage Daydream\\" with it's great power guitar chords, and \\"Suffragette City\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", as well as the pop ballads.  In all, this is a classic release from start to finish, an essential disk for any collection.
B0013FNC38|5.0|My first contact with Jason Mr&agrave;z's music happened when I heard \\"I'm yours\\". And that was it. That soft, sexy, relaxed feeling of \\"music made with the heart\\" made me look for the album. Then I fell for \\"A beautiful mess\\", and ever since it became my favorite CD.<br />This are times when everybody would rather burn or copy music, but for me was important to get to know the artist and the rest of his music. The instrument, the lyrics, it`s so worth it!<br />Then you go to his webpage and understand that he is not pretending to be \\"cool\\", he really is. This is music that won't fade out in time. It will last.
B000RGSOR8|4.0|I bought this cd from Amazon and loved it and ended up seeing her in concert and it was great.  Can't wait to check out her new album that comes out in May.  So many phenomenal songs.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Stop reading all reviews and just listen to \\"It's Summertime\\" and \\"Are you a hypnotist?\\". That should give you all you'll need in order to pick this cd up asap if you havent already. Truly one of the great experimental-rock bands with the emphasis on \\"mental\\". This adds to their maturing and amazing songwriting and musical skills that became so evident on Soft Bulletin.  Stevens drum work on Are you a Hypnotist ranks right up there with some of John Bonhams classics like \\"Good Times...\\" and \\"...Levee Breaks\\".  We are all just so glad he's clean and sounding great. Although \\"At War w/ the Mystics\\" lost that pounding drumwork that is heard here.  What musicians and this cd does nothing but puts a big smile on your face the whole way thru. Even throwing away the overplayed and brilliantly layered \\"Do you Realize.\\"  I could gush on for hours.. Just dont pass this one up.  -DD
B0000057D8|3.0|For those who like a baroque sound on Bach, Trevor Pinnock does an excellent job. For a discussion on musical mannerisms, one can find plenty of that on other reviews. My concern on the \\"baroque\\" sound is that it blurs the distinction between Bach and his contemporaries. This particular recording makes it sound a lot like Telemann. That could explain why Bach's contemporaries failed to recognize his greatness (Telemann was the first choice as Thomaskantor while Bach was only third). For those who want a similar set of suites and concertos that highlights the towering genius and driving power of Bach, I recommend the Kehr-Faerber set on VoxBox.
0061673730|5.0|Quite simply, this book changed my life.  After reading it many years ago, I went to college and grad. school, something I'd never even considered before.  That was 15 years ago, and I still read it yearly.  I've also wound up with an odd collection of motorycles over the years and many, many miles around the country.  I credit many successes and insights to this book.    Despite my obvious bias, the book is well written and damn interesting.  It does get tiresome at points, and it does linger too long on some philosophies, but that's part of the ride.  Every trip has times when you just want out of the car, but it's always most rewarding when it's actually taken you somewhere.  I belive this book can.  There is a lot of hype and subculture surrounding this book, some merited and some not, but don't bother reading this or any other book for those reasons.  If you are looking for one man's way to discover self-actualization and his tragic burnout, this is a great read.  If you're looking for scripture, you should find it somewhere else.
B0019M06JS|3.0|I don't understand why Eliane Elias has to repeat herself again. Didn't we hear the \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" enough? I wish she would have added some originality to this song. However, \\"Day by day\\", and \\"A ra\\", are great.
0385333846|4.0|I didn't like \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\" one bit, so I was hesitant to read this. But thanks to this little giveaway table in my building lobby, I found this piece for free just waiting to be plucked. To be honest, what drew me in was that old timey paperback book smell. You just can't beat it.<br /><br />Not what I was expecting. It's an anti-war tale with Billy Pilgrim as its very boring, troubled and certifiably insane protagonist. Billy acquires timetravel powers as a POW right before the firebombing of Dresden during World War One. With these powers, we are shipped around through the here, before and after of all things Billy Pilgrim. He starts off as a quiet outcast and pretty much stays that way throughout the ups and downs of his whirlwind life. Strange and withdrawn, he still manages to survive terrible experiences, make love to a movie star, meet his favorite author and marry into wealth.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and get kidnapped by aliens.<br /><br />When I call Billy insane, which he definitely is, I still do not imply that he doesn't actually have timetravel powers. No, that is never disputed as his future is presented before us in the ways he predicts. But he is surely out of his mind nonetheless. The price of acquiring this super power, maybe? Could be. He's just a lunatic who can surf through time. And that's my kind of book right there.<br /><br />Vonnegut breezes through the piece with an air of sad humor, often narrating in first person, always witty and ironic. His catchphrase of \\"So it goes\\" when dealing with the topic of death or someone dying did eventually become maddeningly tedious and bored me to distraction, but he sometimes found creative anecdotes for which to build up the line, which I welcomed hungrily. A town gets bombed and so it goes. A fly gets swatted...so it goes.<br /><br />It's a thoughtful little novel with a big message, not without many of the author's first-hand accounts of his own time as a prisoner of war alongside the fictional Billy Pilgrim. Some Vonnegut recurring characters pop up for novelty's sake and sometimes because they just need to be there. Some were memorable, others not so much. Either way, aside from Edgar's death being ridiculously anti-climactic when he was being built up into a real character, I have nothing to keep me from recommending this fine book.ng characters pop up for novelty's sake and sometimes because they just need to be there.

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|If you are looking for a film with characters you can empathize with, moral redemption, and a happy ending, this film will leave you unfulfilled.  I must admit that this film caused a serious argument between myself and my SO within a half hour of watching it.      This film is a social commentary about relationships, how people deal with unhappiness, and the constant search for answers in situations where there are NO answers to be found.    Its easy to be seduced by the beautiful scenery, wit, and gag comedy that pops up thru out.  In the midst of this I found myself becoming increasingly unhappy by the choices made by ALL of the women in this film who found convenient reasons to lie, cheat, and deceive.  First they deceive themselves and then everyone else around them....for what?  Is that the question of this film.... What are we searching for and what are we capable of during the search to find and ACHIEVE it?  Secondarily, do we even understand ourselves well enough to define our happiness when we so easily toss away the things we search for once we have them?    If character development is your thing, this could be your film.  If you wish to feel good afterwards, RUN RUN RUN from this film....
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|Let me state right off, that I love Michael Jackson..im really pissed that ive gotten all these unhelpful reviews on a review that refects this collection..it's NOT Ultimate, ive given it four stars, i mean i obviously liked it, but it could have and should have been better.im sad that Michael is gone, but I wrote this review months ago, and it is a fair assessment..nobody who loves MJ's music wouldnt agree with my review..i mean what did you think of his last album Invincible?..I mean it broke my heart it was so bad..ill take the eleven or whatever unhelpfuls, but dont paint me as somebody that does not love Michael Jackson or his music that really is unfair, i mean, grow up..I suppose this is the best one can hope for in relation to the King of Pop.  Look, im a thirty-something, so I love Michael Jackson, I grew up on Thriller, and I have to say that album is very well represented here, my uh ultimate complaint, is what is up with the Demo's?..who wants to hear those?..I mean, the Demo version of PYT is awful and where is Human Nature?, arguably his best song, it's religated to the Bucharest, uh yes Bucharest concert footage.  Im totally perplexed as to why they added the concert DVD, with songs that on the DVD, that are not included in the CD collection, and why Bucharest?..granted it was pure Jackson, with all the shots of girls fainting, odd considering we all know he's gay, and of course all of his posing and strutting and grabbing his body from stem to stern, I really thing he gets off, I mean really gets off, to preforming, it's bizarre.  For the moment, this is the most definative collection of Jacksons catalogue, it's hardly perfect, but it's so Jackson..incomplete and bizarrely arranged.
B001QB9H10|3.0|I would probably give this three and a half stars if I could. I may not have enjoyed it quite as much as the first two movies, but I don't regret that I bought it either. It is basically the same kind of material the first movies contained, just remixed. Remixes are okay but they lack a little originality. That is the only thing missing in this movie. He transports a woman, he did that in the first movie. This is a daughter being kidnapped again as in the first movie, but by a stranger keeping people in control by trying to force her father the EPA rep to sign over dumping toxic waste rights. His friend the French policeman helps him get answers as he did in the second movie. There are couple shirtless fight scenes were Frank shows his nice physigue and fighting style as he did in previous movies. So overall the movie is entertaining with plenty of the same as the first two, just nothing that stands out as new. As for the originality of the exploding bracelets, I have seen them before in multiple forms including around the neck and ankle. I listed one movie below. By the same token people shouldn't ping on Frank because he does things that seem impossible in this movie (breathing through a tire valve underwater and driving a car on two wheels between two semi-trailers, he did impossible things in the first two movies as well. To say any series including Mission Impossible and Bourne Identity didn't rehash some things and do the impossible would be hypocritical, so enjoy this impossible rehash. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B0001Y4M22 Wedlock]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B001IF252M|5.0|I recieved this adapter today. It works well. I bought it due there are no DVI connections on projectors we use at work and in University, so I was unable to show my presentations from Macbook.

For external monitors (Asus 22\\" and LG 20\\") I use my Mini DisplayPort/DVI adapter which also work well.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I think Elisabeth Vincentelli is off her rocker, or maybe I've misunderstood her review above.  It's wonderful music, very relaxing (with maybe the exception of the militia marches in).  My copy is played so much, the CD is almost transparent.  If you're a classical music lover, you'll like this one.  Very well composed and performed.
0783226845|5.0|This is classic Pacino. It's the kind of movie that is hard to watch, not for anything bad, but because my boyfriend will not stop quoting lines the entire time. It's the kind of movie that leaves you to say for years after, \\"... like in Scent of a Woman?\\"
B001R10BMS|3.0|At once the victim of impossible expectations after years of false starts and rumors about Connery's return to Bondage and also a breath of fresh air as the Roger Moore Bond films increasingly floundered, Never Say Never Again was a welcome riposte to the worst excesses of the EON franchise in 1983, but time hasn't been that kind to it. There are certainly some horrible miscalculations, Carrera's cartoonish villainess Fatima Blush (like Faye Dunaway on steroids), Edward Fox's self-parody as M, Pamela Salem's moronic Moneypenny and an embarrassingly over-the-top Rowan Atkinson's horribly unfunny Nigel Small-Fawcett among them, not to mention that problematic and much-despised easy listening score from Michel Legrand.     A famously troubled production, with Cubby Broccoli frightening studios, investors and co-stars away through years of lawsuits and Connery taking against the film's inexperienced producer Jack Schwartzman so violently that he would reportedly hide whenever the actor came anywhere near his office, most of the scars aren't visible in the finished product. Thankfully the worst excesses of the legendary unfilmed but sadly rather silly and OTT script Connery and Len Deighton penned in the early 70s, Warhead (which climaxed with a hang-glider attack on the Statue of Liberty and boasted a villain with his own underwater lair), were also toned down, albeit largely for budget reasons. With only a watered-down version of their radio-controlled sharks remaining, this version is at least a little more grounded than the rampant silliness that had seen the Bonds stray unrecognisably far from their roots in Ian Fleming's novels. Despite uncredited co-writers Ian La Fresnais and Dick Clements pilfering their earlier movie spinoff of Porridge for some of the jokes, the more streamlined screenplay flows better than Thunderball, which was always the clunkiest of Bond scripts in its desperation to throw everything including the kitchen sink into the mix, but it's also less fun. Odder still is the very American feel to the film, with a clean, spare look that's uncomfortably at odds with Connery's previous outings.     On the plus side, Klaus Maria Brandauer is particularly good as Largo, Bernie Casey brings an easy familiarity to his role that makes him one of the best of the many Felix Leiters in Connery's tenure, and Alec McCowen and Max Von Sydow are fine in undemanding parts while Robert Rietty, who voiced Largo in Thunderball as well as numerous other Bond characters over the years, turns up briefly onscreen for a change. It's also thankfully light on the gadgets that got particularly out of control in the EON series during the 80s and the action scenes are for the most part well-handled, with an excellent fight with Pat Roach the standout despite a particularly lame gag ending. Enjoyable but no enduring classic.    After years as only a no-frills edition with just a trailer, this NTSC collectors edition includes a heavily-lawyered three-part documentary on the making of the film, audio commentary by director Irvin Kershner and Bond historian Steven Jay Rubin, trailer and stills gallery.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I love the X-Men. I was a fan of the comics back when I was a kid, so I have an enourmous emphaty for the characters. Altough I've long been over my early younger days infatuation with superheroes the x-men and Batman universe still \\"call out\\" to me, so every time there is a movie or even television series based on both these universes i allways take a peek. Usually I end up dissapointed (aside from BATMAN TAS, Wolverine and The x-men The second Noland BAtman movie and the first two X-Men and Hellboys, there really aren't many sucessfull adaptations of superhero universes onto moving picture), so I have learned to lower my expectations considerably.   X3 is not that bad. It's fun enough to watch and the action is allright. It has it's gripping moments and the actors where well casted. I adctually enjoyed it. But for a comics purist this movie will be maddening and insulting... Hell, I'm not one but I feel there were alot of choices that were pretty exagerated and that kinda got in my nerves. For example,  I remenber the phoenix saga and this has little to do with it. Also the death of all those X-Men was idiotic and unnecessary. Juggernaut has nothing to do with the comics nor he has any relation with Xavier, etc, etc. It's a shame because the first two movies were pretty faithfull to the source carachterswise. For a comics purist this will be a maddenning film...   But If your not a purist and you set your standarts a little low it's fun enough. It's not that terrible. Besides, as enjoyable as the first two X-men movies were, they werent THAT amazing to begin with...

B00133KDM8|4.0|My Winter Storm is apparently her first solo album since moving on from Nightwish.  The album is not bad.  Her voice still just as nice.  Nice to relax to.  Do not compare this album to Nightwish's older albums as the music style is different.

B001PA65VW|5.0|I have been a big fan of The Prodigy for a long time. I have all of their albums, so naturally when I heard a new album was coming out I began to froth. The box has 5, 7' Vinyl records that span the entire album, The CD/DVD combo, the Lost Beats CD, A sticker Sheet, two stencils (one is the album logo, the other is The Prodigy's new logo) and an Invaders Must Die poster. I have listened to the album many times over and each song is absolutely amazing. If you have heard \\"Omen\\" as the single, the album version is different. It comes across a lot harder and heavier, which is awesome. \\"Thunder\\" is a fantastic new song, as well as \\"Take Me to the Hospital\\". The album is fast, upbeat and doesn't let up until the end. The Lost Beats are great as well, none of the songs have a vocal loop, and all seem to flow together as one song. Overall the album is the hardest and best since \\"Fat of The Land\\", If you are a die hard Prodigy fan, or just looking for some good techno. Look no further.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Bob Rock is gone.<br /><br />Okay a few more words. While it is still fun to call them Metallicker for all the tripe they've put out, this is a great metal album, the kind of stuff that they do best.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|As the second in the series, I liked that this movie went deeper into the history behind the characters. Where the first movie does a good job introducing the two species, Evolution goes beyond to explain how these two, vampire & lycan evolved.   My only complaint would be that the ending leaves too many open questions about the fate of our two heroes. And as the third movie centers around the beginning of the war, I suppose we'll have to wait for a fourth to reveal the future.
B0002IQEHI|2.0|Every artist has a bomb in them. This is one of Hitchcock's.     No good purpose is served by pretending to like this movie-seems like the editors and a good chunk of reviewers put metaphorical horse blinders on while watching because an ostensibly \\"great\\" director is overseeing it. It's a dumb movie no matter who is at the helm. The comedy is sub-par, Cary Grant is given inane and foppish dialogue as he tries to woo Eva Marie Saint's character, and the intrigue is nonexistent; you can get much more adventure out of the worst of the James Bond films.    We all look back fondly on the classics in any medium. That said, a critical eye should separate the wheat from the chaff. Finding this glass-jawed lightweight a great timepiece of the 50s memorable lacks discernment. I will give it one thing...the score is superb. It does alot of the work in terms of atmosphere that the visual part of the flick is unable to provide.    Bottom line, if you're on a classic movie tear, save yourself a painful 2+ hours and don't bother with this malarkey. Liberate thyself from the tyranny of blind artist worship for the sake of banal vanity.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Whether you're into sci-fi, action, vampires or forbidden love, this is the movie to watch. Speaking as an fan of action, this movie is visually appealing. The camera work adds to the adreniline on the action sequence. But what really caught my attention was the romeo/juliet thread throughout the movie. In a reversal of natural rolls, Selene is the romeo, the stronger, protective lead in this vampire/human turned lycan relationship. Where as, Michael plays an excellent girlfriend. :)    I choose the unrated extended version for the bonus features. They are really enjoyable.
B0000027I6|2.0|Goes in one ear and straight out the other. Close to unlistenable...if this is the best of Waters on its own, I shudder to think how bad the others must be. This is nakedly derivative. Songs about the corruption of the soul by money and war...hm. I think we've heard this before, Roger. It bears repeating perhaps, but this showcase is poor. Melodies, if you can call them that, cop from previous Floyd works. The lyrics don't save the day either, they seem facile and contrived for the most part. Waters' voice can't reach the manic levels of the decade preceding this release either, robbing the content of urgency.    I agree with every sentiment in this album. I think we monkeys are amusing ourselves to death, but one will not find much of that amusement here. Granted, that's not Waters' goal, but what I'm saying is the style/execution doesn't connect to the listener. Throw that on top of recycled thematic content and it's plain to see that Roger might want to look into a painting career instead of tarnishing his musical legacy with mediocre songwriting.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I can't believe this is actually Stevie's first live concert on DVD. What took them so long? Man! this video is just excellent, the picture quality, the surround sound and how about the supporting cast? The band did a superb job. You felt like you were actually sitting in the audience. I only wish I was there in person. I didn't want the show to end, I know it's not possible, but I wanted him to do all the favorites, which probably would've been a six hour concert or even longer. I had a chance to see him live in NY, but I procrastinated and the show was sold out before I got to the ticket office. This is the next best thing. After over 50 years in the business, Stevie is still a \\"Wonder\\". The best part about this DVD is the price. This is a steal. Well worth the money. I would've paid a lot more, without question.  Buy it today!

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I don't know how this one ever got past my radar, but I'm glad I finally discovered it. It was quite by accident. My mom and I were sitting watching one of her ladies' channels (Oxygen or CO2 or some such silliness), and I remarked how much the story was like Cinderella. (We had missed the beginning, when the narrator, a female descendant of Cinderella's, explained to the Brothers Grimm that this was the real story behind their fairy tale.) Well, it was delightful. It had humor, adventure, romance, villainy, gorgeous sets and costumes, a top-notch cast - pretty much everything. If it hadn't been for Shakespeare In Love and Saving Private Ryan dominating the Oscars in 1999, Ever After probably would have taken some of the statuettes for cinematography, art direction, sets and costumes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's two stars, Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston, did win awards for their acting (not at the Oscars, but at other award ceremonies), which were well deserved because both women are terrific. Ms. Barrymore is the perfect Cinderella (Disney's 1950 animated version notwithstanding), although in this tale she is known as Danielle. And Ms. Huston (The Royal Tenenbaums, Mists Of Avalon) is perfectly mean, in a delectable sort of way, as the step mother. As with the Brothers Grimm version, there is no fairy godmother in the story; but there is Leonardo da Vinci, who, in my opinion, serves a much better purpose: he provides magic without it being unbelievable, and it is Patrick Godfrey (The Count Of Monte Cristo) who does the honors. I mean, pumpkins turning into coaches and mice becoming footmen? What was Charles Perrault, the 18th Century inventor of those fantastic elements, thinking?!<br /><br />Prince Henry, who is smitten by and then pursues Cinderella, is played by newcomer Dougray Scott. (He later starred in Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde and The Ten Commandments.) Scott does an admirable job balancing swashbuckling tendencies with boredom. It is his boredom that Cinderella challenges. She can't believe how complacent he is, considering how much responsibility he will have as the future king of France; and he can't get over how passionate, committed and alive she is. Writers Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant and Rich Parks have done something at which most modern screenwriters fail miserably: they've given us a compelling story about characters that are full of wit and charm, whom we honestly care about, and whose fortunes are in the balance until the very end.<br /><br />Like most classic fairy tales, Cinderella contains a timeless lesson that we never tire of hearing: that virtue wins over circumstances. Even though Cinderella is persecuted by her step mother and one of her step sisters, she overcomes this through perseverance, her concern for other people and her love of life and living. I like this version of the tale far better than Perrault's, which uses magic to rescue Cinderella, and is therefore difficult to relate to real life; and that of the Brothers Grimm, which contains some very grim elements indeed (like the step sisters cutting off parts of their feet in order to fit them into the glass slipper, and birds pecking out their eyes), making it equally unbelievable.<br /><br />Cinderella has been made into countless stage and screen productions, including the 1957 Rogers and Hammerstein TV musical starring Julie Andrews; the 1965 TV musical starring Lesley Ann Warren; and Stephen Sondheim's 1987 stage musical, Into The Woods, starring Bernadette Peters (based on the Grimm version and encompassing other fairy tales as well) - not to mention all the operas and ballets. But this latest version is, in my opinion, one of the best.<br /><br />The director of Ever After, Andy Tennant, has done a remarkable job weaving all the fascinating elements of both story and production together. Even more remarkable is the fact that most of his work has been for television, and this does have a certain made-for-television feel to it. But not only is it far, far better than most made-for-television movies, it out-shines most theatrical films. As a comparison, I think most viewers will find it to be at least one star better than Princess Bride, a film that is similar only in its storybook nature. I actually found myself reminded of First Knight more than any other film; although, again, this one is far better. For a good story that will capture your imagination and heart, and which the whole family can enjoy, Ever After is a charmer.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithmost made-for-television movies, it out-shines most theatrical films.

1603580557|5.0|Dana Meadows was the possessor of a profound and influential mind, and as one of the authors of The Limits to Growth pioneered the systems approach to problem-solving.  This book outlines and describes and gives examples of how to examine and diagnose and understand systems.  A system is an intricately connected set of things, processes, influences, people, etc.  Pretty much every problem that's important to solve involves a system of some kind, and many solutions that attack one prominent and visible feature of a system fail because of the effects of the rest of the system.<br /><br />Perhaps this seems obvious, at least now, but there is much to learn from Ms. Meadows book (edited by a friend after her death).  The examples are well-chosen and range widely enough that there will be at least one you (or the coworker, boss, board member, or other person you want to influence) will understand and be affected by.<br /><br />And, yes, the writing is clear and attractive.  If you're interested in these complex issues, read the book.  And pass it to anyone you know who is about to enter the working world.  We need more systems thinkers.
B000ZNRBK4|3.0|This is a good lens hood for the 18-55 VR.  Unlike many other Nikon lens hoods, this one does not screw on to the unit.  Instead it has a spring action that clamps the hood to the lens.  There are two buttons on opposite side of the hood that you press in to put on and then release to clamp.  It doesn't scratch or pose any damage to your lens and fits snuggly.<br /><br />The hood performs well, but it is on the small side.  As a result, it does not block light as much as I was wanting.  Also, don't expect this hood to protect your lens... if you are worried about that then use a UV filter.<br /><br />The hood performs well and should be purchases if you can get a good deal on it (don't buy at MSRP).  However, don't expect miracles.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Action. Betrayal. Cunning. Danger.  These are but a few words that describe this effort starring Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie (among others).  I can't really add more to the positive things that have been said (or the negative).  I found the movie somewhat enjoyable.  You do find yourself rooting for the 'kid' with all the 'Bull' he has to put up with in his sorry life (see for yourself).  Well filmed, good special effects.  I rate the flick: Four stars (and I actually recommend it - as a 'change of pace')

Although I enjoyed it,the repetition of the lives of the rich and famous who actually did it (found their 'element')kind of bored and tired me.  I think he should have put more emphasis on how everyday people have found their element and I think it doesn't necessarily have to do with profit and fame.  When I finished it,I felt as if he was 'urged' or 'pressed' to publish..  Still,it is worth reading!
B001LF4IA6|2.0|If you have been a Bruce fan from the very beginning, I can't see how you can really like this cd as it's so far removed from the gritty rock n' roll storyteller we grew to know and love.  What we are given here for the most part are slight pop songs that left me wondering how Bruce could have resorted to this. Sure his mega record deal requires him to put out product but couldn't he have shown a bit more restraint?  Beyond the weak songs, the E-Street Band can hardly be heard on this cd as they are overshadowed by the overblown and muddy production.  Perhaps Brendon O'Brien realized the weakness of these songs and tried to cover that up through overproduction.  I can only hope that live concert versions of this material will ease my disappointment.  Suffice it to say that this cd will not stand the test of time like most of Bruce's stuff but instead will be relegated towards the bottom of the collection.
B001DDBCUU|3.0|I loved the show Sex and the City very much.  It was great.  The first season was Ok, the second season very good and the third and fourth seasons were classics.  Fifth and sixth seasons showed wear and tear on the franchise and it was good that they stopped there. Still the show was never, ever bad.  But it is stretching it to give this movie three stars!  The story is very trivial and not true to itself.  The \\"plot complications\\" aren't much of anything at all.  The characters have lost their honesty and pathos and the actors seem uncomfortable and unassured.  Chris Noth and Jason Lewis have an especially hard time acting out their roles.  What happened?  I think the length of a movie and the pacing caused some trouble.  I also think that the desire to keep most things from changing brought problems too.  Even the belief that the characters had very little change for the 5 years between the movie and the show (as told by the movie) seems baseless.  Children don't seem to matter here much either.  The women leave their kids for Mexico in a way I don't think the TV characters would have ever done.  I was glad I saw the movie on DVD and not in the theaters.  I would have been outraged if I had had to sit through this in the theatres.  The show emphasized relationships and a type of reality piled on with lots of compassion.  Every show had a moral attached in some way.  The movie is about fashion, wealth and melodrama.  The incidents in the film are trivial and untrue to the characters.  Disappointing.  Hope the next one is better.

055299703X|5.0|I have given up reading Bill Brysons books in public places these days.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|I love this DVD.  As you would expect, the performance is spectacular.  The lighting, sound quality, video quality, camera work and editing are all excellent.  Dream Theater is a musicians band, so don't expect alot of pyrotechnics, dancing and showmanship, just 5 guys playing their hearts out with the precision of a well oiled machine.  Don't get me wrong, when I say machine, I'm not saying that there is no emotion.  Even a fine sports car has a soul.  My Porsche has a personality of it's own, yet it is built with the kind of precision that only the finest German cars have.    If this DVD were a car, it would be a Ferrari F430.  Fast as hell, with a beauty and grace that tugs at your heart.  Buy this DVD, and play it on your 1080p wide screen at ear piercing volumes...You won't be sorry.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I went into the first listen with an open mind.  I listen to and love all types of music, including pop/RnB and Metal/Hard Rock/Grunge.  My first instinct was how much the album sucked, it just sounded like a generic Timbaland production with uninteresting songs (static harmonic changes, boring melodies, etc) sung by a great sounding voice.  BUT, the more I listen to it (I'm probably around 15 listens now) it gets better each time as the songs slowly reveal themselves to me.  'Get Up' may never be as good as 'Preaching The End Of The World' but I'd say give the album a fair shake.  Now I totally dig it.

068485743X|5.0|This is one of the best books on writing that I've ever read.  It's amazing the amount of information Mr. Lukeman packs into just over 200 pages.  Some of the stuff is instinctive to any decent writer, but some of it is really surprising.
0316017922|4.0|This is simply one of the best books I have read..for the first 200 pages. Unfortunately, the last 150 pages mostly wasted my time.<br /><br />The authors makes a very convincing argument that, while talent and IQ matters, other facts such as number and quality of opportunities, mastery of a skill through practice (10,000 hours), demographics, birthdate, and proper upbringing matters even more.<br /><br />A preeminent success involves a conjunction highly developed skill and being at the right place to utilized that skill at the right time.<br /><br />The author does not disparage talent nor hard work. In fact, he states many times both are neccessary for success. Hard work is a prerequisite for success. Most high achievers have practiced their skill for at least 10,000 hours to attain the mastery. But having mastery in something in a society which offers no opportunity for such skill is a deadbeat path.<br /><br />It is too bad the last 150 pages were fillers. Although the author still writes entertainingly, he mostly meanders through mostly repetitive ideas and themes. To sell books, the publishers require non fiction to be 300+ pages. It is somewhat hard to justify a hardcover book with a sub 200 pages.
0061808121|5.0|This audio book is a wonderful version of the classic novel.  I love the idea of listening to this on a long road trip.  This novel captures life in a small southern time during the time of segregation and the Great Depression and brings to life the quirky personalities one might find in any small, close-knit community, as well as the great and not-so-great qualities of humankind.  Of course, one of the best aspects of the novel is Atticus, a great classic father figure.         As a high school teacher, I find this is a great resource to use when we do whole class readings.  Not only does this save my teacher's voice, but the reading itself is very enjoyable and authentic (Southern accent and all!)  The narrator accurately captures the tone and characterization found in the dialogue, and reads at a slower pace, allowing for students to interpret the meaning of some parts that contain difficult vocabulary words.  The audio CDs are also wonderful to use since I can monitor students during the audio portion, and pause to discuss important scenes and events.  Highly recommended!

0061689246|2.0|I read this book after watching the movie and being disappointed by it.  It was strange, the movie had a great plot and a ton of potential but just kind of fell flat.  As a long time member of 'the book was better' club I decided that the movie makers must have mangled it and got the book.  The book was not better.<br /><br />This was my first Gaiman book, but since I had heard good things I entered with high expectations.  I remember plots.  I remember characters.  I remember little bits of trivia that others forget.  I wish I could give you a detailed review describing specifically where this book went wrong, but for the life of me I cannot remember.  I do remember feeling like I was waiting for the story to pick up and take off right up until the book ended in its blah-like fashion.  Gaiman managed to take what had the potential to be a great story and turned it into a chore.

1582701709|1.0|I generally like to keep my distance from overly hyped propaganda; however, there are indeed times when I break my resolve and ask myself, \\"What have you got to lose?\\" That's the question I asked myself prior to purchasing 'The Secret'. My answer really should have been, \\"Money and time.\\"    I truly believe that the graphic design and the paper stock used in the  printing of this book was worth more than the content of the book itself. The mystique surrounding 'The Secret' made it seem as though the information that it contained was priceless and could not be found anywhere else.    Sadly, that just is NOT the case. The primary premise behind 'The Secret' and its \\"Law of Attraction\\" is that you get what you give. It really is as simple as that. If you put negativity into the world, you're going to receive negativity in return. If you put positivity into the world, you're going to receive positivity in return.     There is a secondary premise as well, and it is all about thinking in a positive manner. This involves changing your thoughts of \\"I cannot\\" to thoughts of \\"I can\\". In fact, there is a quote within the pages of 'The Secret' that sums this premise up brilliantly in about 14 words:     \\"Whether you think that you can, or that you can't, you are usually right.\\" (Henry Ford)    I was really hoping that this book would have something worthwhile between the front and back covers. Needless to say, that was so far beyond being the case [for me]. My money definitely could have been better spent on more beneficial reading materials.    Oh, and on a side note - someone mentioned in a previous review that there are no religious biases within this book. Erm ... did I miss something? There are several references to 'God' throughout the chapters, which leads ME to believe that there are indeed SOME religious biases here.
0930289234|1.0|With the age of television coming out on DVD, have you gone back and watched an episode of the A-Team, MacGyver etc... and found it really really really dated, to the point where it's almost unwatchable?<br /><br />In the 1980's this was edgy stuff. Superheroes that weren't really super. An ending that (spoiler) leaves millions dead.<br /><br />In 2009, I go from Dexter (serial killer) to Grand Theft Auto (killing for fun) to any number of edgy graphic novels/films/video games that, frankly, are far better written than this piece.<br /><br />I doubt very much if the \\"Watchmen\\" was pitched to a comic firm today that it would ever see the light of day. The dialogue is often painful to read, the costumes absurd, the plot ludicrous and characters far exceeded in modern media.<br /><br />If this was 1986, this comic would easily be a \\"buy\\"...in 2009, unless it's a nostalgia trip, save yourself the bother.
0060935464|5.0|In To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee weaves a coming of age story with its own everyday heroes.  Scout and her brother, Jem, learn valuable lessons about life from the colorful characters around them and a society fraught with hard economic times and racial tension.  Set during the depression in rural Alabama, Scout leads us through her world with the innocent eyes of a child.  Not always understanding, but ever seeing.<br /><br />When Scout's father Atticus Finch is chosen to represent an African American man accused of raping a white woman, the stage is set for these children to learn some very valuable lessons about life...and the greatness of their father's integrity.  When things are rough and the family may lose its innocence, a most unlikely hero steps from the shadows to save our young heroine and her brother in their time of need.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird may be a classic for many reasons, but it will remain in this reader's heart for its character, its integrity and its willingness to step outside of the societal norm and see the goodness in people regardless of what the world at large may think or be told to believe.  You would be hard pressed to find a classic book more easily entertaining and heart warming as this one.<br /><br />If you are not a reader, I highly recommend watching the 1962 movie of the same title, with Gregory Peck starring as Atticus Finch.  If it is possible for an actor to capture the spirit of a character and bring that character more readily to life, I have not seen it yet.<br /><br />Enjoy![[ASIN:0060935464 To Kill a Mockingbird]]
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Everyone likes to go on about Cornell's artistic prowess, yet it's not just song and lyric writing that has always made CC's music superb:  His voice could make or break many a song, and Cornell was a master at making his voice an integral part of his music.  The songs on Scream are not in themselves horrible; without the Timbaland influence, many of the songs could be revamped into decent rock tunes.  However, the entire album emphasizes Timbaland's role (the title should read \\"Timbaland's Scream, featuring Chris Cornell\\"), and Chris - Chris's voice - now seems like an afterthought to the music.  When the greatest SINGER in rock history allows his voice to play 2nd (3rd, 4th?) fiddle to the music,  well, it's MUCH WORSE than disappointing.
0385340990|4.0|I bought a copy of this book for my mother who is in FL for the winters as a Valentine's Day present so she and I could read it at the same time and discuss it, we both loved it!  It was a very easy read.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|As a kid in the 1980's (like pretty much everyone on the planet at that time) I was a MJ fan. The first album I ever bought with my own money was Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\". Then I went backwards from there, got my hands on \\"Off The Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\". I lost interest around \\"Dangerous\\", to put it bluntly, because of his exceedingly bizarre physical appearance and \\"Earth Song with a children's choir and angels\\" -type performances.     I still think he's a type of genius, and a brilliant pop songwriter (not to mention lead singer, background singer and dancer), who made pop history together with Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton.    Not much live material exists of MJ's concerts, which is a shame. So I went in with an open mind, anxious, having read all the positive reviews of this DVD. Now, when reading this, keep in mind that it's coming from someone who appreciates the man, not from a \\"hater\\".    In short - I wasn't impressed. First of all, there's obviously quite a lot of lip syncing and playback, especially noticeable on \\"Black Or White\\". You can REALLY easily tell when Jackson is singing live, especially early on in the concert, because his notes fall FLAT, when he's singing live, really often. I've noticed this on a lot of live clips I've seen of him, that he really isn't at his best singing live, I don't know if it's the (enormously physical burden of) dance moves that take their toll, but that's how it is. Still, at least he didn't MURDER a song like Siedah Garrett did during \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", she was so out of tune and off-key that it hurt.     Second - showing the screaming, crying, hysterical, fainting kids over and over again was REALLY unnecessary. Yeah, we get it, MJ's a super star and he has the craziest fans. Would've been ok to show it maybe once. Then again, the cameras managed to get some nice shots once in a while, like the happy hat-wearing girl during \\"Billie Jean\\".     Third - the performance of \\"Human Nature\\"...was just...bizarre. He was barely singing it (I think he messed up the lyrics as well), just making these orgasmic noises and performing a truly strange jerky dance routine in what looked like a golden corset.     Fourth - and sure enough, we got the children's choir and angel imagery as well. He had a bad case of Jesus complex in the 1990's.     Still ... the dancing was as impressive as ever, the moonwalk on \\"Billie Jean\\" still amazingly cool after almost two decades, and some of the performances simply kicked a**, like \\"Smooth Criminal\\".
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Man On Wire documents Philippe Petit's quest to become a tightrope walker beyond comparison. The cinematography is very well done. In addition, we get lots of quality archival color footage and we also get very recent interviews with people who helped Philippe even when they didn't always see eye to eye with him. His girlfriend at the time, who provided Philippe with so much moral support, is also interviewed.<br /><br />Although we don't get much in the way of background about Philippe Petit; we are told he was brought up in a strict household and he's essentially a rebel, going around the streets of Paris juggling balls and doing magic tricks on a unicycle. Philippe is obviously a brave man and he was very strong physically and emotionally as he prepared for the challenge of walking the tightrope between The World Trade Center buildings. Philippe also recruited a crew of friends, including his then-girlfriend; and together they all embarked on their mission to help Philippe prepare for his big goal of walking on a tightrope between what was then called \\"The Twin Towers.\\"<br /><br />We see footage of Philippe walking in a field on a tightrope and he learns how to do it very well rather quickly--good for him! He eventually became so good at this that he could even do it with his eyes closed. Incredible. He then scaled the towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris; and he also walked a tightrope on top of a bridge in the harbor of Sydney, Australia much to the chagrin of the police. It's interesting to note, however, that Philippe gave the police a run for their money without ever committing a serious crime.<br /><br />And then came the preparations for the grand achievement--walking a tightrope between \\"The Twin Towers.\\" Philippe and his friends prepared meticulously back in France by making small scale models of the tops of the two buildings and making numerous drawings of the scenario in order to study it from every possible angle. They didn't leave a thing to chance especially because Philippe's desire to walk that tightrope was so risky in and of itself. They even swayed the tightrope while Philippe practiced so that he could get used to walking on a swaying tightrope when the two buildings if any wind was blowing on the day he was going to do walk that tightrope.<br /><br />One extremely interesting part of the adventure was actually conning their way into the Twin Towers to take pictures from which they could study--and prepare the tightrope the night before so that Philippe can walk early one morning in August of 1974. We see how they got in to study the buildings and how they eventually entered for the big event. I'll let you watch the film to see how they managed all this--on several occasions, too!<br /><br />What happens to Philippe after he starts to cross the tightrope and the police show up? Will he get off the rope right away? Will his accomplishment change his relationships with his friends and his girlfriend? Does he ever do this or anything like it again? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras. There is a retelling of this true story for children entitled The Man Who Walked Between The Towers; and there is another interview with Philippe Petit as well. We even get a featurette about Philippe's experiences in Sydney back in 1973.<br /><br />Man On Wire tells the fascinating tale of a once in a lifetime event--that of a brave man walking a tightrope between \\"The Twin Towers.\\" However, on a broader scale this film is really about the importance of acting now to fulfill our dreams and achieve our goals. Only then can we savor life. The interviews we get are pretty incredible. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys documentaries or films about the importance of living life to the fullest.Philippe's desire to walk that tightrope was so risky in and of itself.

075640407X|5.0|Though this book didn't instantly grab me by the heart as some others have (namely GRRM's Song Of Ice And Fire beginnings and Orson Scott Card's Ender series), once Kvothe begins telling his tale, nothing existed in my mind other than worries about his safety.  The reader becomes so involved in the story that he almost takes parentage for this protagonist.  I can almost guarantee you won't be sorry you read this book.  A new classic.
0930289234|4.0|Great story, great art work, phenominal story.  This graphic novel is exceelent.  I truely enjoyed the read and i'm glad i read it before the movie came out as this will put the storyline in a much better perspective for me.  My only concern is the timeline, the novel is based in the 80's and really calls upon events that would be fairly old to young readers today.  With that said, the story line is exciting and fast paced.  Pick this book up for a good read.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|it is a brave thing to join the armed services to protect and serve our country... I am very thankful to all the men and women who are now serving or have served us in this way... my dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, my brother is now retired from the Air Force and one of his sons is currently in the Marines, soon to head off to Afghanistan... being a Christian, the thought of killing another human being is a very sobering thought... eternity is vividly in the picture... so how should a young person who is walking with God in their life, deal with the questions that toss around in your mind??... Sergeant York wrestled with these things... in this movie, the director did an awesome job of showing a very real relationship between the soldier and his God... and I would recommend this film to share with others who may be facing the same questions, either from their past experiences or from the possibilities that lay ahead in the future... this is one of the favorite films of all time of my husband and I... if you haven't seen it yet, you really should see it
B000YXMMAE|2.0|As someone who thinks the Bends and OK Computer are two of the best albums ever, In Rainbows comes as a huge disappointment. Good tunes are in short supply and the band are trying to make up for this with plenty of textures and busy sounds, much of which sounds insipid and not even experimental anymore.
B000000I0I|4.0|In the 70s when it came out it seemed to resonate with cosmic beauty - now slightly less atavistic, but still has moments of pure illumination, fringed with greatness. It distilled the Zeitgeist of its era.  Sat comfortably with Gawain and the Green Knight, Tao of Physics by Fritjof Capra, films by Fassbinder, Stan Brakhage, Nicholas Roeg, etc.  (Even the pic of Oldfield on the front evokes Jesus Christ Superstar)    I dock one star because Part II is simply not as good.  My record was worn down listening to the magical Part I and the quintessentially English \\"On Horseback.\\"     \\"Et o, ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\\" (thank you, TS Eliot)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I started watching this show in Season 2 and was recommended to watch Season 1 to understand the story line.  This is a terrific show, and it watches like a play without commercials.  The extras (such as interviews with the director, writer, and actors) are extremely interesting, and point out details I would not normally appreciate.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Look, this movie was cook, ok?  But when it gets right down to it, the absurd premise and plot were recycled from nine million other straightforward sci-fi tales, and the action was a far, far cry from the Matrix, Kill Bill, The Killer...I could go on.<br /><br />The &#34;Gun-Kata&#34; was ludicrous.  The only convincing use of it was at the very end when Christian Bale's character finally confronted the &#34;big boss.&#34;  The sword fighting scenes were better, as were the moments when the Bale character evaded armed opponents/stole their weapons/turned their weapons against them--that was inventive and convincing.  But even those moments where the action came alive were all too brief...most scenes of action lasting only a minute or so.<br /><br />After those fleeting scenes of excitement, the film sinks back into the utterly predictable drugged/Utopia/totalitarian-society sci-fi that's as familiar as the classic Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, or more recent fare such as Gattaca.<br /><br />The highlight of the film was certainly Christian Bale.  His performance was so engaging and controlled, he raised the level of an otherwise completely predictable clich&eacute; to something enjoyable.<br /><br />In short, I reccomend this film.  However, it is not the ne plus ultra of Sci-Fi-Action that some reviewers would have us believe.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|I wonder if people aren't afraid to rate it a little lower just because nobody else did. There are some good characters and some great writing, and the first episode was absolutely riveting. But there are also some long, drawn-out boring parts to most of the remaining episodes.     I don't need to see so much angst-ridden family discussion about the main character's disease. I don't need to see the man who's going through chemo vomiting, much less twice. They could have found somebody better to play his wife, I found her to be vaguely annoying, boring and stereotypical.     It's almost like a made-for-TV version of a Quentin Tarantino movie.    But when it's good, it's great.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|Following up modern classics The Seeger Sessions and Magic is no small task, not even for a legend like Bruce Springsteen. Rather than labor over a new set of songs in the studio for years as he's done in the past, Bruce and band quickly recorded Working On a Dream in late 2008. Keeping in mind the keyword here, \\"quickly,\\" Working arrives much different than its back story would suggest. The tunes are solid, the production is full and the set is diverse. Most impressively, this is an album unlike your average modern Boss record in that from time to time is speaks a language not really heard too convincingly on other Springsteen releases. It's a happy, hopeful album that takes a few chances.    Opener \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" for starters, is a head scratcher. Browse through the man's catalog and you'll notice one thing: blisteringly good opening tunes. Singles, usually, the kind you hear at the bar and at the grocery store. Not to imply that \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" a eight-minute song that many reviewers have rightfully likened to Kiss tune \\"I Was Made For Lovin` You,\\" is a bad song, but track two, \\"My Lucky Day,\\" just screams \\"opener!\\" \\"Pete\\" is a doozy of a tune that is sure to grow on fans and reviewers over time. It's a big production of a story song, complete with strings, dramatic swells and, of course, a stuck-in-the-head hook.    Following \\"My Lucky Day\\" (a tune that hits every bit of criteria on the classic Bruce checklist - no different from 2007's \\"Radio Nowhere\\") comes the title track, a super produced, anthem-ready tune you can expect to hear at pretty much every Springsteen full-band show from now to eternity. Strings, once again, swell and flush throughout, making for one of Springsteen's most fully developed compositions of the current decade. The strings and almost over-the-top production will surely put off many of the faithful, but others, especially those who loved Magic or welcomed the new sound of Born In the U.S.A when it was released in 1988, will find much toenjoy here. Okay, what I'm trying to say is this: **Working is not a sequel to Nebraska. It's not an album about lyrics and its approach won't make snobby audiophiles smile in secrecy. This is a pop album - turn to track 11, \\"Surprise, Surprise,\\" for solid proof.    Better yet, turn to track eight, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" a beautiful, simple and short songwriter tune that's equal parts Magic and Seeger. \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\": killer or awkward filler? Different folks will tell you different things - a fact that's likely true for every song included here not called \\"My Lucky Day.\\" Working is Bruce's version of a modern day U2 record in that the production style is the only thing that feels focused and consistent, while the content, though mostly good enough, nods to many different sounds the artist has tackled over the years. It's an album full of well made - albeit semi-cheesy - tunes that will give the most loyal fans much to love and others much to complain and tease about. Style over substance, but, for the most part, it works. (Greg Locke)
B000002H97|4.0|Out of all the Metallica albums I have ever owned, this one is one of my least favorites.<br /><br />There are songs on here that are good - lyrically and musically - but for the most part, I was kind of disappointed. Certainly not their worst album, but they have definitely put out better ones.

B000NIVJHM|4.0|At the Oscars, they were predicting that musicals were going to have a resurgence.  It seemed like time to revisit some of my old favorites and see if they were as good as I remembered them to be. In the case of \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" I'm happy to report the answer is yes.     The story's been told before.  A young girl, Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes to a summer resort and falls for Johnny Castle, the dance instructor (Patrick Swayze). There's a complication, John's partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant by one of the college boys. Baby helps and ends up getting in trouble with her own dad, Dr. Jake Houseman. Johnny accepts responsibility, since the 'cad dad' won't. Johnny's from the bad side of town and the doctor just doesn't want his little girl messing around with a tough guy like him, particularly one who got his dance partner pregnant.      The music's fabulous, including numbers by The Righteous Brothers, Mickey and Sylvia, etc.  The dancing is even better.  This is Swayze at his best.    Well worth the time to watch and they've done a great job bringing this film to DVD, too.    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009

B001M5UDGS|5.0|For all of us Joss Whedon fans, this short made-for-the-internet movie is a hoot!  Having it on DVD with background extras is like ice cream on top of your birthday cake.

B001N44BVQ|4.0|Very good for several reasons:  1) nice juxtaposition between the mundane life of Crowe's character -- Hoffman -- and the brutal, vicious life that DiCaprio is experiencing on the ground in Iraq and Jordan.  It shows the distance from the US, and why we as a people don't fully \\"get\\" what's really going on  2) full of twists and turns that play out to the finish  3) excellent examples of spycraft and the soul-killing calculations that are part of this field -- both technically interesting and dramatically engaging    The violence is rough, and the edition I had contained no special features.  This is one DVD where it would be great to get the \\"making of\\" and other commentary.  Definitely worth seeing.

B00005HGR8|4.0|While this is not one of my favorite Neil Young albums, it is a solid effort. It was a top ten hit on the US album charts and produced his first solo top 40 hit \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" and the minor follow-up hit \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\". It includes probably his most overrated song, the clich&eacute; ridden \\"Southern Man\\", which is really just a remake of his excellent \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\". It was popular primarily because it helped perpetuate anti-southern and anti-Christian stereotypes (the only two groups that it is still politically correct to stereotype). \\"Tell Me Why\\" is a very good song as is \\"After The Gold Rush\\", though Young's vocal limitations are very apparent on this song as he struggles to hit the notes. \\"Till The Morning Comes\\" is good but sounds like a song that he started but could never finish. All-in-all, a good album but not a great one.
B00005JL96|5.0|This was a pretty entertaining \\"kids\\" animated film. It was a little different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good role models.     However, as the film progresses, all those characters (small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring \\"people.\\" There also is a good \\"no one is left behind\\" family message. You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the beginning.    I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie 100 percent devoid of the slightest profanity.    In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly recommended.  As soon as a Blu-Ray high-def version comes out on this movie, I'll buy it!

B0006GVJEE|5.0|This is one of those flms they call \\"guitly pleasures,\\" because it has some very sick messages but is uniquely appealing at the same time. I've watched it many times and bought severarl versions, the last being this one.    It's a very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; There are tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. The little girl Natalie Portman, as \\"Mathilda,\\" does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child.  It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star.  Despite his profession, \\"Leon\\" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. Also, there is a very satisfying ending;  Finally, I like the reat camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.    The bad messages?  Well, not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but  (on this deluxe extended version) she gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her. Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) Finally, we see another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys.  Come on!    In the end, though, it's only a movie, just a fictional story and it's job is to entertain....and in that it succeeds amazingly well. This is greatentertainment in a perverse way, which is why I re-purchased this DVD to get 24 more minutes of the film.
0143036742|5.0|Wow -- this is a tour de force. It's been a long time since I read a novel with serious content that moved along so swiftly and lightly.     On the one hand, \\"Short History\\" is a comedy, a farce. A decaying 80-year-old Ukrainian who's lived in England since the end of WWII marries a 35-year-old buxom bombshell from the home country. She's obviously seeking his money and access to British citizenship. Their relationship is a tug-of-war that often pulls into the fray other Ukranian immigrants, neighbors, and the man's two daughters. The bomshell's broken English curses -- \\"Crap car. Crap husband. Meanie no-good husband.\\" -- are priceless.    On the other hand, the book is a poignant look at how the evils of Stalinism and WWII ruined the lives of tens of millions of people. Pappa and his wife survived the hardships and were able to escape to the West. They built a new life, but the old one never disappeared. As his daughters seek to help him out of his self-created predicament with the bombshell, other bombshells keep landing as stories of the past are retold, and family members try to reconcile with their pasts.     The more deeply you go into the book, the more serious it gets. However, the humor is never absent. And the family drama becomes a sociopolitical drama -- played out across countries, decades, languages, cultures, and family members.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|This is an outstanding collection of Elvis' Gospel music.  Gospel was one of Elvis' early musical influences and loves.  He puts his heart into every performance and of course his voice is unmatched.  The only \\"Grammies\\" he won were for his Gospel recordings.<br /><br />The first three CDs include songs recorded for 1957's \\"Peace in the Valley\\" EP and his three outstanding Gospel albums 1960's \\"His Hand in Mine\\", 1967's \\"How Great Thou Art\\", and 1972's \\"He Touched Me\\" along with some other Gospel songs recorded during the period that were released on other albums. The EP and all three Gospel albums were hits when they were released and all have been certified PLATINUM or MULTI-PLATINUM by the RIAA.  Some of the songs were hits on the singles chart in the US, including \\"Peace in the Valley\\", the classic \\"Crying in the Chapel\\", and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\".<br /><br />The last CD has Gospel songs from his movies, from the 1968 comeback TV special, including the moving \\"If I Can Dream\\" (while it is not technically a Gospel song, it is certainly inspirational), and live concert performances.  There are also a few demo recordings.<br /><br />The songs have all been remastered and sound better than any previous releases.  This collection is a must for Elvis and Gospel music fans!  Highly recommended!
B000053VAZ|5.0|For anybody that may feel they are one of the more awkward ones, this is a good kind of off beat kind of love story. It's a good one, definitely recommend buying this. I can't stop watching it. It's the movie I go to when I can't think of anything else to watch. Never fails to entertain.
B000002UDB|5.0|One of the first albums I owned was a compilation of Beatles' songs which got produced some time after the band split up. The songs which I instantly loved appear on this album. Of the studio albums by The Beatles which I own (Sgt.Pepper and White), this is EASILY the best of them.        An album like \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" is the kind of album that Rolling Stone magazine would list as the greatest album of all time. Personally, I tend to think of that album as having one and a half great songs and a song or two which are good.  \\"White\\" is a popular album amongst fans of the band, but I view it as being stuffed with way too much padding-there's definitely not two cds worth of material on that album...it would be a much stronger album for having, say, 15 songs on it only.       Now, before I can definitely say that Magical Mystery Tour is The Beatles' greatest ever album, I'd have to check out two album which critics who like to be different nominate as the greatest albums of all time: either \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Rubber soul\\". Those albums have their work cut out for them, in any case.       The great tracks on this album are:    I am the walrus: a masterpiece. This song cancels out \\"A day in the life\\" on Sgt.Pepper, I think. The lyrics are fantastically deranged, in John Lennon's inimitable style. The drumming is good in this track, and the recording is composed as if by a lyrebird, or magpie. In other words, bright, shiny sounds are arranged for their accoustic appeal, in the way that the birds above grab pretty, shiny, colourful objects to adorn their nests. Features brass instruments and string instruments.    Magical mystery tour: a slight, but infectious pop song. Very sing-a-longable, my favourite drumming by Ringo Starr, and featuring a good brass section, bass, and a nice gear change in the song. This song cancels out the title track from \\"Sgt.Pepper\\".  Those two songs from Pepper are what I consider to be the \\"one and a half great tracks\\" from that album. It's from here on in that Magical Mystery Tour pulls ahead of Sgt.Pepper as an album.    Hello goodbye: another catchy pop song, with nice beats from Ringo, violins, and a good change of direction for the outro.     Strawberry Fields for ever: a witty song, with lyrics sounding like they were written by someone with heat-stroke! The drumming is really interesting in this song. Good guitar sounds near the end of the song. Use of studio effects. Cello and brass instruments feature. Another one of Lennon's 'trippy' type songs. About a place.     Penny Lane: another song about a place, this time by Paul McCartney. When this song would get played in primary school music classes, I always thought it was about a woman! But careful listening reveals this song to be a Sims like virtual tour/time capsule of a Liverpool street. Very nice brass section, and the lyrics have warmth.     All you need is love: The French loved the introduction to this song so much that they based their national anthem on it! A song with a positive message. Not being a historian of music, this songs seems to me to be an early example of intertextuality. I.e. The Beatles 'cut and paste' part of another song of theirs into this new song. Sort of like 'sampling' as used in hip-hop etc. Good lead guitar and backing vocals. Features violin, brass, and bass, I think.        The songs above are the ones that stand out the most. The best of the rest would be:    Fool on the hill: thoughtful lyrics, featuring piano, flute and brass (the tuba?).       This album gels better for me than albums like White and Sgt.Pepper. Pepper is meant to be a 'concept' album, which sort of implies a sense of unity in the album. That sense of unity is something that I have never discovered in that album. Am sceptical even of the extent to which it is a 'concept' album. This scepticism was confirmed when one of either Lennon or McCartney said as much. I.e. they said that the album was like all their others...a collection of songs, with nospecial effort made to create a sense of unity or whatnot.        \\"White\\" too has an odd-bod collection of songs which gives rise to no sense of unity either. Unlike other reviewers, I find Magical Mystery Tour to have a sense of co-cohesiveness to it. It does not seem overly a collection of unrelated singles to me.        Songs which give rise to this sense of unity to me include:    The fool on the hill    Flying: a bluesy instrumental with some vocalisations and an organ.    Blue Jay Way: presumably about another actual place the band knows about. Another trippy song, with organ and studio effects utilised (tape played backwards in parts, I think). A melody strikes me as familiar in this song, but I can't pin-point it.       These songs 'gel' with others like \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"I am the walrus\\" or other place themed songs like \\"Penny Lane\\".       One song which did have a melody which I could pin-point to other songs was \\"Baby you're a rich man\\". Annie Lennox' \\"Put a little love in your heart\\" seems to draw on a melody from this song.        Lastly, the sense of this album being 'faux' stereo is not as strong as it once was. Probably had this album on cassette years ago, and perhaps that sense of it not being proper stereo was exaggerated. On cd, the effect is more tolerable. However, you will hear drums playing on one side of your speakers or headphone, and the vocals being on one side and sometimes moving to the other speaker mid-song.       That is a minor quibble though. A masterpiece of an album, in my view. How this album doesn't contend for the title of \\"Best ever Beatles album\\" is beyond me. White and Sgt. Pepper have nothing on this album...wonder if titles like Revolver, Rubber Soul or Abbey Road can knock Magical Mystery Tour from its pre-eminent position in my heard.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|$5? I paid $20 to import these from the UK back before they were available here. Well worth it even at that price. They fix a really embarrassing design flaw in PS3 controllers. If Sony is paying attention, they'll either start including these as an optional add-on with the factory controllers, or change the design to make these unnecessary.
B000SJWI1C|4.0|While this is not one of my favorite Neil Young albums, it is a solid effort. It was a top ten hit on the US album charts and produced his first solo top 40 hit \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" and the minor follow-up hit \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\". It includes probably his most overrated song, the clich&eacute; ridden \\"Southern Man\\", which is really just a remake of his excellent \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\". It was popular primarily because it helped perpetuate anti-southern and anti-Christian stereotypes (the only two groups that it is still politically correct to stereotype). \\"Tell Me Why\\" is a very good song as is \\"After The Gold Rush\\", though Young's vocal limitations are very apparent on this song as he struggles to hit the notes. \\"Till The Morning Comes\\" is good but sounds like a song that he started but could never finish. All-in-all, a good album but not a great one.
B0000VD04M|4.0|It's an odd movie, but a well made one. It has that classic black and white movie feel that it strives to achieve while still being on a much more modern topic. I liked it though, an interesting buy. The acting is pretty great in this movie. Johnny Depp has always been good though, so I guess it should be no surprise.
B00005CDNF|5.0|That a studio album by this supergroup could be so chock-full of classics emphasises just how great they were. The version of this album which I have, I bought many years ago here in Australia. It is superior to the current version (which I am forced to review here as there appears to be no separate listing for it on Amazon-must be a deleted version now or something). The reason why my older version is better is because it has more bonus tracks, and those bonus tracks are incomparably better than on the other versions of this album. According to Wikipedia's information on this album, all the versions of this album have the first eleven songs in common. It's after that they diverge. The tracks on my older version are, from the 12th song on: Waterloo, Hasta manana, Honey honey, Ring ring and Nina pretty ballerina.       I'll give my review for the older version, but mention this newer version at the end.       The best tracks:    Mamma mia: an ABBA classic, and what a way to open the album! The piano on this track is great and an unusual instrument features...something like a glockenspiel, I'm guessing. Catchy chorus, nice guitar and drums, bass...and I think I detect violins in there too.    SOS: Another absolute classic. Probably my favourite ABBA song. Has there most memorable piano playing-a moody introduction, with both ends of the piano getting a work-out, for two great melodies...bass on one end, and more mid-range for the other. Nice plaintive singing on this melancholy themed song by the beautiful blonde Agnetha. Great chorus and nice strumming on accoustic guitar.    I do I do I do I do I do: Really nice melding or doubling of the female vocals. Features the saxophone, I think, and piano. Amusing use of bells for this song, given the lyrical hint of the title.     Rock me: One of the men in the band take the vocal lead in this song, which is more rock orientated. Listening to this album, you are reminded (or learn) that ABBA did stray into rock music and weren't just a pure pop band. Like the drum intro for this song, and the hard rock, throaty singing style of the man who sings it-I think it's Benny, but I'm not sure. Electric guitars are used in this song.    Intermezzo no.1: a catchy instrumental, in the 1970s style. Piano and electric guitar features. Good fusion of classical music with a funky, modern sound. Violins and brass instruments also feature.    I've been waiting for you: would not have classed this as an ABBA classic, but reaquainting myself with this song, you realise just how good it is. Has a synthesiser intro, and a lovely vocal performance from Agnetha. This is a pretty song which does have changes in mood. There is some lead electric guitar in this song with a country music flavour, as well as nice accousting guitar strumming.    Tropical loveland: a dreamy song which I only heard infrequently as a child, as  did not have this album. Always captivated by this song. It's a bit of a hidden gem for people who only know the band via compilations.  This song may also feature a glockenspiel type instrument. I like the drum intro to this song. Not sure if a piano accordion type instrument is used here. A really smooth song, with a pinch of reggae flavour to it.    The lesser but not bad songs from the part of the album that is universal to all versions of it are:    Hey hey Helen: nice drum intro then a hard rock type riff, a funky break in the middle and featuring the piano as well.    So long: features a screeching electric guitar intro and solid drumming. A rock song with a brass outro. Empowering lyrics for girls, I suppose.        Of the bonus tracks on my older version, the notable ones are the Eurovision song contest winning \\"Waterloo\\" which is a terrific ABBA song (and has a cool, piano pounding riff), as is their first attempt at winning the Eurovision, I think, \\"Ring ring\\", which Neil Sedaka had a hand in. Another country flavoured electric guitar sound on this one. The drums are thumping in this song (they sound heavier than normal drums)and there is a good drum fill as well.        If it was possible to score the version of the album that I have, I would have put \\"Eleventeen out of ten\\" in my header. Apart from the songs I mentioned above, the song that really helps with giving it eleventeen is \\"Honey honey\\". This song is 110% pure sugar, with an extra table spoon of sugar. It's pure pop, but a masterpiece of the genre. I like the violin intro to the song, it has a vibe of being sung by a teenage girl and is sensual and sexual. When the man sings, it is overtly sexual. Something you tend to forget about the band...occasionally their lyrics and stage performance could be quite raunchy for the image that they had. Did note a reference to \\"The sweetest thing\\" in my jottings for this review. Maybe U2 were influenced by this song?    Lastly, just a note on song styles:    Hasta manana: has a 60s vibe    Man in the middle: one of the men sings this song and it has a funky 70s American sound to it.    Ok, not for the current version of this album:    The remaster is very good, which is not to say that the older version is less than professional...it's not.    There are only two bonus tracks:    Crazy world: one of the men sings this song; it has a Chicago (the band) vibe to it, with maybe a taste of \\"Arthur's theme\\" to it (these songs come to mind listening to Crazy World, but it no doubt preceded those songs). Hmm, maybe this song even reminds me a bit of the theme from \\"The greatest American hero\\" too! A narrative song with a twist. Not bad.    Medley: the 1st and 3rd songs are more towards the rock end of the spectrum. Not of much interest.    Overall, my version of the album is a masterpiece, especially for adding a few of their older hits on it. The current version of this album is still a classic. Of the first eleven songs on this album, I'd say that three of the songs are classics, and four are terrific. Did seem to remember finding \\"Bang-a-boomerang\\" to be cringe-inducing, but listening to this album again for the first time in a long while, it stood up as a decent pop song...just not a great one. Even their bad songs are catchy!    Essential purchase.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|For anybody who's on the fence about this new Elvis gospel box set I'd just like to point out that in comparison to the previous offerings \\"Amazing Grace\\" (1992) and \\"Peace in the valley\\" (1999) this new box set features dramatically improved sound quality and is a must-have if you didn't get last year's individually reissued gospel albums.  It doesn't get any better than this!

B000F1IQNM|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. I found this to be a great movie for old and young alike.
B000002KOO|3.0|I had read a review stating that the mastering was poor on this CD before I purchased it. I usually remaster CDs to my own liking anyway. I found that in the quiet sections of \\"Oh Well\\" there was much surface noise from a record and at the end of track two, there were actually some clicks. I am not sure why Warners would release a CD made from a record or maybe Caimen purchased CDs from a pirate. You can't buy these tracks on Itunes so having the album is great, but I would prefer a CD from the original master tracks.
B0013HA838|5.0|This production of Figaro restores one's faith in opera.  It also illuminates the shift from the \\"Viennese School\\" of Mozart singing and production typical of the 50's and 60's, to a more modern, hard-hitting style of Mozart-as-Theatre, bypassing - thank heaven! - the prevalent ghastly school of opera-as-an-extension-of-the-producer's-ego, which has driven so many of us out of the opera house.<br /><br />The old \\"Viennese School\\" cherished a style which emphasized subtle nuance and magnificently polished singing, perhaps best personified by the work of Elizabeth Schwarzkopf.  Splendid recordings made a whole generation of us cherish such releases as the Giulini Figaro (and Don Giovanni) and the Mozart recordings of Karl Boehm and the early Karajan, where refined singing and polished ensemble were always the rule.  The Solti Figaro, though a bit more energetic, was perhaps the last of these.<br /><br />The new school, which one hopes this magnificent performance may encourage, is certainly ensemble based: the McVickars production shows the results of many hours of rehearsal and much thought.  But at times, it tends to burst out of the somewhat placid, purely musical bounds of the Viennese school: recitatives are interrupted with business, or for emphasis or comic effect - they do not  simply flow on.  Emotional outbursts between the characters, as perhaps most notably an in-the-face confrontation between Figaro and the Count in Act Three, simply overwhelm for a moment the purely musical aspect of a given scene, always to great effect, and always for a reason rooted in the drama and illuminating the situation..<br /><br />It is terrific theatre.  I have never before seen a production of  Figaro where the Countess' pain was so clear and aching, or where the naked brutality and dominance of the Count was so blatant.  Similarly, Rinat Shaham is the most convincingly boyish Cherubino I have ever seen.  Stage business clarifies, over and over, the motivations and situations of the characters, and the singers move, act, and react in a style that reminds one more of top film making than of opera.  This must be seen!<br /><br />A few minor quibbles: why place the action circa 1830?  One guess is that eliminating all the wigs and hoopskirts and swords and knee britches may bring the action a step closer to the audience.  And why, or what, is the last act supposed to represent?  A conservatory?  Perhaps - but if so, why the piano and formal furniture scattered about in what suddenly seems like clutter.  Or is it supposed to be outside the walls of the palace?  If so - again, whence the piano, etc., and the screens?  These questions distract from the music, and at times seem even to puzzle the singers - Erwin Schrott seemed for a moment or two to lose the plot during this most complex and delicate of acts.  But let me emphasize that the first three acts were brilliant, with the sets magnificently enhancing everything that went forward.  Perhaps the fourth act went over better in the theatre: on the small screen, it was confusing.  Acts one and two are performed as one, with brilliant scene transformations, as are acts three and four, most effectively.<br /><br />The singing is uniformly excellent, if not quite aspiring to the highest refinements of the old Viennese school.  One suspects other things - the drama - were paramount.  But then that school rarely rose to these dramatic heights.  Erwin Schrott has a very fine base voice, and looks and acts the part of a young, active, sexy Figaro.  Miah Persson's Susanna is everything a Susanna ought to be and is always \\"on\\" in this very long role.  Dorothea R&ouml;schmann sings wonderfully and her acting illuminates every emotion of the Countess - her humor, her patience, and her pain.  It is magnificent acting.  Gerald Finley is one of the leading singers of our day and is very fine, but - dare one say it? - more perhaps more a Figaro than a Count; he simply does not look like an aristocrat, though he sings like one.  Antonio Pappano conducts with vigor, grace and clarity.<br /><br />For a wonderful \\"Viennese School\\" Figaro, one need look no further than the Glyndbourne production with Gerald Finley (Figaro), Renee Fleming (Countess), and Andreas Schmidt (Count), all under the baton of Bernard Haitink.  This is superb - traditional (the sets are somewhat stylized), graceful, superbly sung.<br /><br />An odd thought: this Figaro is meant to be seen as a whole; I wonder if it would hold its own on purely aural terms, as a CD, well sung though it is?  The Glyndbourne production certainly would - but then it needs less to be seen than to be heard, wonderful as the acting of Finley, and the minor characters, is.  Different emphases in each - and both are magnificent.<br /><br />Do not go to the dreadful Jacobs DVD.  I enjoyed the performance hugely on SACD: passage after passage came to a new life, and it was a joy to hear young voices and such active and perceptive recitative.  But the production which the DVD documents is dreadful, a discouraging example of the worst sort of ego-driven \\"look what I can do\\" production which does nothing to illuminate the drama, and is a constant distraction: ugly, cluttered, egotistical, unnecessary and irrelevant and disrespectful both to the audience and to Mozart. The Drotningholm Figaro, under &Ouml;stman, is the only disappointing production from that generally delightful and successful source.<br /><br />This new DVD is one I shall return to often with gratitude and enjoyment.ducts with vigor, grace and clarity.

B000YJ54DU|4.0|I disagree with those who find this book a mediocre addition to the series.  It shares many of the virtues of its predecessors, including a strong, complex female character.  I don't share other reviewers' ideological objections to the book.  That the Iraq war has produced casualties including brain injuries, that it's been less than a complete success, that privatization of medical care is a not unmixed blessing, and that one can simultaneously embrace the military and its virtues while questioning the Iraq war seem to me thoroughly established as true.
B000002L5J|5.0|Excellent second offering from this guitar virtuoso.  The influence of Stevie Ray Vaughn is hard to miss, but the vocals of Noah Hunt give the KWS Band a distinctive sound.  Somehow, Somewhere, Someway and (Long) Gone are the best of the bunch, but Blue on Black was the radio-friendly hit.  This is what modern electric blues should be.
B000NA2776|4.0|I'm a straight guy, lives in the US and I've always dug the Scissor Sisters.  I don't know any other guy who does who doesn't live in the Castro (SF, US).  That said, I created a Scissor Sisters channel on Pandora and this artist named Mika kept showing up.  Of course that's probably because I gave every song of his a thumbs up.     Finally, since I found Mika to be similar in vocals to Scissor Sisters, I had to buy the album (see RIAA!  We do buy after sampling!).  I love this album and it makes for a good fix in-between Scissor Sister albums.    Fun lyrics, upbeat music and just an explosion of good times like a mix between Queen and Elton and Scissor Sisters.  If you like any of them, you'll enjoy Mika.
0061120081|5.0|Rather than reviewing this timeless classic that has already been read millions of times and will be read millions more, I'm going to share what I got out of my most recent reading.<br /><br />The message I took away this time is respect for all people.  All the Atticus', Scout's, Jem's, Tom Robinson's, Calpurnia's, Mrs. Dubose's, Heck Tate's, Boo Radley's, Mr. Cunningham's, and even the Bob Ewell's.  Atticus was the perfect example of this, getting to know people as individuals and not as a member of a group.  He helped Scout and Jem to see Mrs. Dubose not just as an angry old lady who shouts terrible things to them, but as a woman with an addiction trying her hardest to overcome it (and does).  Scout innocently helped the mob outside the jail (or at least Mr. Cunningham) to view Atticus as a man with children instead of just someone trying to stop them from getting to Tom.<br /><br />In respecting all people, Atticus was respected by almost all (obviously not Bob Ewell), even though they may not agree with his choices.<br /><br />I read it with three of my children.  I got a little nervous about the book choice when I remembered what the trial was about, but knowing the message of the book isn't rooted in the rape, I went for it, sometimes reading it as such, sometimes replacing \\"rape\\" for \\"hurt\\" (because of some of their ages and understanding).  I'm glad we read it.  They enjoyed it and we talked a lot about the messages in it.
B00008QSA5|4.0|There's more than enough great playing here to make this disk well worth the price of purchase. Albert's Shuffle & Stop get things off to a tremendous start. His Holy Modal Majesty (what the hell did that mean?) is a wonderful jam, it must have influenced Duane Allman who was just coming into his own around this same time.   The Stills stuff is not quite as strong as the Bloomfield stuff. It Takes a Lot to Laugh..., a Dylan cover, is pretty good. Season of the Witch is totally re-imagined from the Donovan original. Still haven't decided what I think of it. You Don't Love Me sounds really dated, in my opinion. Man's Temptation & Harvey's Tune are not strong.   Alas, the version I had doesn't include the 4 bonus tracks. I might have enjoyed hearing Albert's Shuffle & Train w/o the horns, which definitely feel like they were plunked down rudely on top of the rest of the mix.
B000059T1V|5.0|This is arguably one of the best Muddy Waters' cd's ever released.  Muddy is confident, cocky, smooth, biting, and just downright the blues master that we love and miss.  It's great to live in an age where one can listen to a clean copy of a concert from 50 years ago.
0061020710|3.0|This was my first meeting with Terry Pratchett, whose books I have been warmly recommended on a number of occasitions, and I must agree with the multitudes of readers out there who claim to have enjoyed it. It is funny and original without being absolutely reformatorily groundbreaking, somewhere in between Douglas Adams, Jerome K. Jerome, and Tolkien. The style may seem a bit untraditional, for example does Pratchett not make use of chapters in his work (often not, anyways), and it can, at times, seem a quite random series of events that are playing out in front of you, and not a tightly woven story with a clear progression through time and space. This, upsetting as it might be, to my mind actually seems rather fitting to the Discworld world, where things are not as we are used to them here on earth.    My guess is, that this is not a book for everyone, but you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't at least think it a bit humourous. For fans of D. Adams and fantasy in general, I think it should be rather much of a hit.
0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion is a highly compelling rebuttal of religious dogma, and blind faith; and is a great read for anyone with a sensible intellect. As you would expect from someone of his background, his claims are well thought out, and he provides numerous real world examples to substantiate his claim that humanity's belief in God is but a figment of our imagination, and psychology. At some points (mostly towards the middle chapters) I found Mr. Dawkins continual presentation of evidence against religion to be bordering on tedious (straw men), but what else should I expect from a scientist attempting to illustrate how religion, and the belief in a supernatural God have become detrimental to our society and intellect.     In the end I found the book to be an highly engaging read, and it has reinvigorated in me a passion I have not experienced since childhood; a wonderful curiosity for the natural world, and all the laws that govern it.    He echoes the message that great secular humanists have been trying to get across to society at large for some time now; That we do not derive our sense of morality from religion, and that the natural order governing our would and universe is possibly even more humbling and inspiring in it's absence.    Mr. Dawkins begs us to use cognitive capabilities we posses, and remember the words of Dr. Carl Sagan;    \\"Extraordinary claims Require Extraordinary evidence.\\"
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Liam Neeson is terrific as a divorced dad with special skills who does not flinch when it comes to rescuing his daughter half a world away.  So called \\"white slavery\\" is very real and Leeson pulls no punches in the single-minded pursuit of dealing the first deadly blow to those who profit from the human trade.<br /><br />This very fast-paced actioner does not rely on gimmicky technology or special effects.  One-to-one human combat (Isreali style?) prevails in tightly choreographed fights that are believable.<br /><br />I saw the Euro version -- probably a few minutes of added intensity.<br /><br />Neeson ought to consider this character as a franchise.  Kinda made me think of a slightly older Bourne.<br /><br /> Recommended.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Very creative third try, and is very succesful in the market due to the I'm Yours single. Rest assured, as much as I enjoy I'm Yours, the song is not the strongest in the album, which is good news to all Mraz' true fans. That means there are many other songs that would get you to sing, to dance, hmm, maybe not so much of stealing things. But it'll definitely steal your heart. Beautiful songs like Details in the Fabric (feat. James Morrison)and Love for a Child offer Mraz' sensitive side. Live High and I'm Yours are so cool, you wish you were chillin' somewhere on the beach. Butterfly is a very sexy piece that'll get you in the mood for some.    Third time is the charm. Can't wait for his fourth. You should definitely make this album yours. I certainly Make it Mine.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Five minutes into the very last track, \\"Watch Out\\", and after a long stretch of silence, there are a few minutes of total brilliance.  The end is a bluesy epilogue to the entire farce of an album.  You hear simple guitar, harmonica and a magnificent voice....this is soulful and beautiful.  These three minutes make this work worthwhile.    The rest of the album is a complete misuse of his incredible voice, which is scarcely heard through the synthetic beats, drowning backing vocals, and repetitive lyrics.    Listen to the end of the last track, you will ache for more of it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a read some reviews and people are saying that this is for advanced levels... Ok, maybe. I am 30 years old, and was very out of shape.  I weighed in at over 200 pounds at a doctor's appointment 2 weeks ago and had to do something about it.  I would get winded carrying the laundry basket up the stairs, seriously it was bad. I am only 2 weeks into this video and already have lost noticeable inches.  I do not own a scale (fear) so I can't tell you how much I have lost, but I can tell you that my clothes are looser, I am getting into my smaller clothes and I feel great! It was difficult for me at first, I could not do all of the jumping jacks, and the jump rope kicked my butt, that was not happening.  I still have to push to get through the crunches, but I can do it.  I feel better now than I have in over a decade.  There is no better workout around, I have tried them all and none of them have kept my attention this long. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

0679721037|4.0|Hersey tells the story of several individuals who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.    What makes the book so fascinating is the very detailed, personal experiences of these people; what they were doing, what they thought when they saw the flash, what their injuries were, what they did in the minutes and hours and months after the bomb hit.    The one thing I didn't like was that it was told in the 3rd person.  I would have liked to have read those individuals accounts in their own words (but of course, translated).    Also, because the various accounts were from people who all had some sort of connection with each other (and why were most of them ministers or doctors), I got the impression I wasn't getting a representative sample.  I also would have liked to have learned more about these individuals views on the war, the bomb, Americans and the aftermath of it all.    Overall, though, a very interesting read.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|OK, I must admit that I'm quite shocked. this is nothing but a hip-hop experiment. Mr. Cornell just abandoned his loyal soungarden-audioslave fan club. except for few sporadic and rare occasions, you won't hear anything that resembles Chris' legendary guitar.<br />Now what should I do with the tickets I just got for his concert next month?!<br />Anyway, I gave this album 2 stars since it is very well produced for Justin Timbaland and co. followers.
B00005R24K|3.0|This movie felt more like an excuse for Sam Raimi to try out film and makeup techniques, rather that try and make a cohesive horror film. There were some pretty impressive effects and camera moves for such a low budget film, and it clearly demonstrated Raimi has a future in the industry, but the film isn't very good otherwise. It was thin on plot and not the least bit frightening, just gore and effects. This has evidently made alot of horror fans happy considering the 5 star ratings, but not even Sam Raimi himself would give this 5 stars. He is surprised that the film has been so well received. Based on the reviews, I was expecting alot more. Despite flashes of brilliance, it is substandard. Raimi did get to show off his range of skills with reverse film, stop motion claymation, frame rate changes and practical effects, but that took center stage over the actual story. I would give the film 2 stars with a bonus star for the creativity and skill shown in a low budget first feature.
1416955070|2.0|I thought this book looked and sounded interesting.  I read a lot of paranormal young adult books and was excited to see if this was a good series.  I listened to this on audio book.  The quality of the audio book was okay.  The lady who read it had kind of a teenage know-it-all twang to her reading that tainted all of the voices for the characters; this may have contributed a little to how little I enjoyed this book.<br /><br />In this book Clary sees some people luring a young man into a storage closet; when she follows them in there she sees that the three youngsters are attacking the young man.  Her friend Simon runs for help but when the police show up; Clary is the only one who can see the group of attackers and the victim.  As if this isn't weird enough Clary's mom suddenly wants them to move out of the city and out to the countryside.  Clary and her mom argue and Clary leaves angry.  When she returns her mom is gone and horrible creatures are in wait for her.  Clary finds out that she can see the true world; which is composed not only of humans but also Downworlders and Shadowhunters.  She ends up in a house full of Shadowhunters and tries to help them find the Mortal Cup in an effort to find her mother.<br /><br />This book was just awkward.  It's kind of done in third person but everyone talks in first person and everything is from Clary's point of view.  It was a weird way to write it; it would have been a more pleasant read had it been written in first person from Clary's point of view.  If this was the only problem of the book then I could live with that.  Unfortunately it gets worse.<br /><br />Most of the characters are pretty stereotypical.  The banter between the characters, especially Jace and Clary, is meant to be witty and funny but comes off as unnatural and overly contrived.  Clary's character is very inconsistent; at times she shows incredibly keen insight and at times she is incredibly dense.  Most of all though Clary stumbles around causing trouble and relies on someone to come and save her.  She is not the type of lead character I enjoy reading about.<br /><br />The unseen magic world is very stereotypical.  The relationships between werewolves and vampires are similar to everything else you've read.  The plot was slow moving and predictable.  I mean I figured out who Clary's father was pretty much right away.  I figured out who Jace's father was mid book; and I was disappointed to find out that I was right.  I don't like it when authors assume their readers are stupid and throw out some many clues that nothings ends up being a surprise.<br /><br />The book ends at an odd spot.  Her and Jace leave to take a ride somewhere to do something important ; then the book ends mid-ride.  That was also irritating.  Overall I thought the book was poorly written, paranormal drivel.  The book tries, oh so very hard to beGothic.  The Gothic clothing and piercings and hair styles are described with such detail it's like the book is trying to force itself to be creepy and Gothic; the effort makes the book feel fake.<br /><br />I usually try to point out some good things about a book too.  I guess the Shadowhunter culture is kind of interesting and the use of tattoos as magic is interesting (although done before).  Strangely enough I thought the plot was similar in a lot of ways to The Signs of the Zodiac by Vicki Pettersson; The Signs of the Zodiac is not a young adult series but many aspects of the plot of the Signs of the Zodiac series are seen here.<br /><br />I won't be reading anymore of this series.  I just can't stomach more of this.  I never understand how some of these books sell so well; they are so many really good young adult urban fantasy books out there.  Check out Holly Black's Modern Fairy Tale series for some truly high quality young adult urban fantasy.n someone to come and save her.  She is not the type of lead character I enjoy reading about.

B000BCE918|5.0|I,m a big fan of the Jurasic Park but I only had it on VHS and DVD is so mugh better and i had looked for it everywhere and my son and I were talking one afternoon and he had told me about Amazon.com so I checked it out and was impressed by evering that I found on the web site I really enjoy my DVD's<br />Thank You,Cyndi Marie Sunderland
B001FBSMF8|4.0|Good pop album. I love the sound, i like the voice of Chris and i didn't miss the guitars.     A good change of direction, good album with several very good songs and very brave. Soundgarden and audioslave are past. Chris look at the future. Scream!!!!
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|Dark and gritty with a tinge of UK garage band punk.  They've returned back to their roots of Fat of the Land.  And although i personally loved Experience, I highly doubt ANYONE will ever go back to that style of sound (oh wells).  But i digress, their signature drum breaks and hard bass lines are back to their original flavor.  I always felt always outnumbered never outgunned was haphazardly slapped together (different sounds ranging from old school punk to vogue), but this album has a nice cohesive feel of wanting to break something..and oh does it feel good.       My only gripe is that this album seems to recycle sounds?  I feel like a couple of the songs were once one big song and then chopped up.
B001DPC4R8|5.0|I really havent listened to a album in so long, just purched a turntable and had to get this classic a listen to , best alone and remembering the past, great band , music, and harmonies are timeless... love it
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Chris can sing the telephone book for me and I'd be in love with his voice just like I was the first time I heard him with Sound Garden.....simply irrisistable and will suck you in....AWESOME!!!
B000P2A256|5.0|Condition of CD was as described.  Delivered within given time frame.  Great price and product.  Thank you!
B000028U0Y|5.0|This CD is just awesome.  If you like Johnny Cash or just live music, you'd definitely enjoy this CD.  After I first got it, I ended up listening to it the whole way through for weeks.
B00008CLOA|3.0|I wanted to import this with iTunes so I could put it on my iPod, but iTunes did not let me? May be due to the fact it is an sacd. Had to buy another one the 20th ann. edition.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|listen to the album 10 times to day at work no lie and i am an international tax attorney and CPA....love it my favorite album all time is his Euphoria Morning album but this one may slip ahead of that one....i am a true fan of Chris's and enjoy all genres as i am a very open minded person...really good album
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Excellent movie, especially for a guilty pleasure. wonderful quality Bluray. worth the price paid. will order again.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Another great disk from Animal Collective! This one shimmers and sparks from the first note until the last as it weaves around the mind's eye. Totally enthralling and beautiful!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Reliable and quality product. This battery maintains its charge for a very long time and delivers the amount of power necessary for about 300 pictures RAW on my Canon 40D (without flash).
B001KL3GWM|4.0|Derek's new disk is very solid with great vocals added to stellar guitar work. Bought the disk on a Tuesday and got to see the band on the following Friday. They played the whole disk and faithfully reproduced each song. Very tight and melodic if not quite as joyous as the previous disk. Trucks truly is the new master of slide guitar!
B000063CPL|5.0|Wow. How old are these guys? This is a great album from a great band. It's hard to believe how little airplay these guys get. There is so much that is amazing here. The new songs from \\"Brave New World\\" are excellent. At least as good as anything they've done. The new songs have a Celtic folk flavor that adds a great deal of depth and heart to Iron Maiden's otherwise outstanding songwriting. Dickenson is in fine voice. Ever the theatrical performer. The instrumentalists are also very, very good. Dave Murray is unbelievable. Smith is his perfect foil. I don't know if Gers is quite as good. But he does have terrific chops and helps write some of their best (newer) songs. Steve Harris is a great bass player. It's all here. Any serious Maiden fan has to have this album. Any serious hard rock fan should be sure to listen to it. Monsters of Metal. One of the best bands of all time (I'm serious).
B000005RQT|5.0|This album brings some of the best moments of the Deep Purple; musics as \\" Child in Time\\" , \\"Speed King\\" e \\"Into the Fire\\" they are classic unquestionable. And this remaster version, with its extras, is wonderful.
B001ILFUDM|3.0|I was disappointed to see this latest restoration of the classic \\"Pinocchio\\" omits a line (a word, really) that Jiminy Cricket speaks during the song, \\"Give a Little Whistle\\":    Jiminy: \\"And if your whistle's weak, yell...\\"  Pinocchio: \\"Jiminy Cricket!\\"  Jiminy: \\"Right! Take the straight and narrow path...\\"    The word \\"right\\" has been dropped on this newest edition of the film -- apparently inadvertently, as it has been present on every previous home video edition and on the original 1940 78rpm soundtrack of the film.  Strange that here it is missing from both the stereo and mono channels on the Blu-Ray.    An earth-shaking omission?  No... but this was supposed to be the definitive home video edition of this film.  It's not.      Disney, who fell asleep at the switch?  Nobody should be doing Q.C. for any of your classic releases who isn't intimately familiar with the films.  Please fix this disc!
B001F12J0C|5.0|All three movies as a group package worked well as a Birthday present and shoping was easy at Amazon.
1899618740|5.0|This is a great little book.  I have a son with Autism and I bought this book hoping that it would stimulate his mind.  He loved it.  He tried to grab the images from the pages with his hand. hehe  My daughter who is 11 also loved this book.  It is very very cool.  Like a portable zoetrope. :D
B001NFNFNU|3.0|The movie content was based on real life.  Excellent theme and presentation. The disc itself had several hangups in coding and it would freeze about five times at major scene changes.  I would have rated it five star if the disc had functioned properly.
0618918248|1.0|Why not write such a book? He's made millions from this book...and found it quite profitable to produce books espousing such untenable viewpoints in this age of Truth.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Beautifully updated both visually and musically. My granddaughter loved it and so did we old fogies, although Pinocchio is my all time favorite.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|I've always loved Chris Cornell, but each of his other solo records seems unfocused, and, really, the same. I had no idea who had produced his latest album, so I went in \\"blind.\\" At first, I thought I had bought the wrong album, but his voice is so distinctive, so I was thrown even further away from my expectations. The first time I heard the record, it was disorienting. The second time allowed me to listen to each song closely, and the third time had me marveling at the seamless production and, yes, laser beam focus. Chris has made a daring record, totally throwing himself well outside his comfort zone, which is where the greatest artists create their greatest works. You have to hop on for the new ride he's taking you on. The melody and lyrics are all there like in his other projects, but now he's collaborated with another iconic artist to create something fresh while being familiar. \\"Take Me Alive\\" will be a hit, actually any song on this album could be, but I think the album has to be listened to from beginning to end, as it is one seamless piece. I think the measure of a true artist is the backlash he or she gets when they go their own way. They're not making fun of you or pushing you(the fan base from his straight rockin' days) away, they're saying, \\"Hey, I think this is cool. If you're into that, still into trusting me as an artist, then follow me.\\" Chris, I've taken the ride, and I love it. I can't wait to hear where you take me next. So everyone, take off the Audioslave and Soundgarden ears and put on a new set for a new sound from two amazing artists living in the 21st century. Great job, Chris and Timbaland.
031606792X|5.0|I'm 21 and in love with these books, despite what I've read in many negative reviews on here. I hardly got anything done while reading this saga, as it's a very suspenseful story (after you've made it about a third of the way through Book 1) and makes the reader genuinely care about the characters, and about what happens to them. I'm now reading the entire thing a second time through. If you've seen the movie and weren't intrigued, by all means please read the book(s), as the movie didn't even come close to doing it justice.
0307120007|2.0|But ok if its for sentimental value.  My son ripped it to shreds the first day.  You're better off with Hello Bee Hello Me if you are looking for something baby can hold himself.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is one epic picture!!! The Blu Ray transfer is superb,lots of great extras!!! A classic film!!! A great 2 disc Blu Ray set!!! Great job Sony Pictures Home Entertainment!!! A+
0739343823|5.0|We took this audio book with us on one of our road trips and what a trip it was! The book was enjoyable, satirical, thrilling, engaging, and a vintage Grisham with twists, turns, and surprises all through! Do not question the plausibility of the plot. Just pop in the CD, sit back, relax, and enjoy!<br /><br />Patrick Lanigan is a fugitive on the run! A lawyer in the past, now living in remote Brazil with $90 million scattered across various banks in the world. He is most wanted by FBI, State of Mississippi, a private sleuth, and a bunch of thugs. Does he get caught? Where did he get the $90 million? Does he get to keep it or lose it? Did he commit a murder that everyone believes he did? Why did he leave behind his wife and young daughter and disappear? Read PARTNER for the answers.<br /><br />While Grisham has proved time and again to be a master story teller, what makes this one stand out is the narration by Frank Muller. He changes his voice in hundred different ways to suit the character, emotion, and situation. He holds the listener's attention all through. Whether you are planning a road trip or a day on the beach, I'd highly recommend you carry this audio book with you!
1904633935|4.0|As far as a collector's edition- this book is perfect! Beautiful illustrations, gold-edged pages, a ribbon for page marking... however, i'm a reader, not a collector.  I purchased this book because it had all of Jane Austen's works and I wanted the convenience of having them all in a single set.  This wasn't the book for me.  First of all, it was HUGE- and made reading it uncomfortable.  In addition, all 6 stories were present, but there was no differentiating them unless you wanted to look at the page numbers.  It seems i'll have to buy each book by itself... oh well.  If it's going to sit pretty on a bookshelf, by all means, purchase this edition.  But if you'll actually want to read it, pass on this collection.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I'll start off with the positives about this movie. The special effects are very good, and the actual Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is edge of the seat stuff! The battleships, planes, army/navy uniforms seem to be correct for the time, also.<br /><br />However, the whole 'love story' part of the movie is a big let down. I've no problem with combining romance into a war movie. If it is done properly, it can help with the character development in the storyline. In this case though the 'romance' aspect was horrendous, unwieldly and unconvincing.<br /><br />Another gripe I have is that the dialogue between the main characters is at best poor, and at times absolutely cringeworthy!! Worse still, it just doesn't ring true for the era!!<br /><br />For me the best part of the movie, was the Doolittle Raid, towards the end of the movie, which was portayed very well. However, a lot of people watching the film, may have never heard of this raid, so would be left scratching their heads at its significance.<br /><br />Five stars for the CGI, zero for the acting. So, two stars, overall, is about right.
0439023483|4.0|It's written in first person and is a tear jerker. It was also a fast read; I was wondering if that would be the case the first chapter in, but by the time the drawing for the Hunger Games came I was hooked and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Strange when you find out what the Hunger Games are - 2 children from each district (all under 18 years of age) forced to battle to the death in a open outside arena for days. The last one standing wins their freedom and a little pocket money. The book is set in the future and reminded me of Running Man or Logan's Run with kids.<br /><br />The main character is a no-fuss tomboy type whose mother has mentally checked out and left her to fend for the family (her father is dead). She sacrifices herself on behalf of her sister whose name was drawn for the games. You get the idea that her younger sister is all that really matters in the end. She has no problem throwing herself to the wolves if it will buy her sister another day.<br /><br />Once she gets to the games things get gruesome and tragic very quick. There is several chapters beforehand that deal with the preparation for the Hunger Games which is treated by the elite as a disgustingly immoral televised survival game.<br /><br />Meanwhile a love triangle develops between the main character and one of the other contestants. The problem is that the other guy in the love triangle is at home watching the game on television, so the only contact the reader has with him is through her memories. This makes it hard to feel much for the guy at home and the triangle seems a tad one sided by the end of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone - it pretty hard not to like on some level.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I saw this film at the theater when it came out and just adored it. For once I could go see a movie without having to see car chases, gratuitous sex, or anything exploding. This is a quiet, thoughtful, lovely film that held my interest from start to finish. It is the tale of Eisenheim the Illusionist whose inexplicable magic shows have the whole city of Vienna abuzz. Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart is the beautiful Sophie who is about to be manouevered into a political marriage to the frightening Crown Prince Leopold. While the movie never explains how Eisenheim performs most of his puzzling tricks, that's not the point. The film muses on the idea of what is real and what is illusory and how do we know the difference. Paul Giamatti as Police Inspector Uhl is our escort through the strange goings-on, and we see the story (or at least some of it) unfold through his skeptical, practical eyes. I won't add any spoilers except to say that the movie has plot twists and surprises up its sleeve that, while they may not shock you, will probably leave you smiling in the end. After seeing this movie three times so far, I can say it's never been the same movie twice for me. With each time I watch it, I find a new nuance to the story (this last time, I was struck by what the movie has to say about aristocracy and democracy). The film is shot in a beautiful sepia-tone that makes it look like an antique postcard, and the music, settings, and acting are all exceptionally well done. I recommend this as a movie to own so you can watch it over and again.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Originally released in 2000, Pitch Black is a low-budget SF/horror movie that became something of a hit, and helped propel lead actor Vin Diesel to action superstar status. A sequel (which I will be reviewing presently), The Chronicles of Riddick, followed four years later and a third movie is currently in pre-production.    Pitch Black opens with a spacecraft passing through the tail of a comet and suffering serious damage. Thrown off-course, it enters the atmosphere of a habitable moon. The pilot, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), almost jettisons the passenger compartment to help save the rest of the ship, but her co-pilot manages to stop her (although he dies in the crash). Of the forty passengers and three crew, there are only ten survivors. A major problem is that one of the survivors is bounty-hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser) and his prisoner, an exceedingly dangerous man named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), who introduces himself as \\"Riddick, escaped convict, murderer.\\" After initially escaping in the aftermath of the crash, Riddick realises he needs the help of the other survivors to escape from the moon and agrees to join forces with them. A great deal of tension in the movie is mined from the unpredictable behaviour of Riddick and the fact that Johns has his own demons and has allowed his obsession with capturing to Riddick to override his humanity. Carolyn also has issues of guilt over nearly killing the other survivors of the crash.    The character study part of the movie is very interesting, although the English survivor Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) is a walking caricature and we don't get to know Australian prospector Shazza very well, despite her being played by well-known genre actress Claudia Black (formerly of Farscape and later StarGate SG-1). The other key characters are Abu al-Walid (Keith David), an Imam on a pilgrimage to New Mecca, and a youngster named Jack (Rhiana Griffith). Al-Walid finds his faith tested as the experience on the planet continues, whilst the impressionable Jack seems to find Riddick 'cool', despite the concerns of Carolyn and Johns.    The focus on the characters is extremely well-done. It's unusual for an action/horror movie to have such well-rounded and believable characters, and the actors all bring their best talents to the job. Diesel is extremely impressive as the anti-hero Riddick, whilst Mitchell makes a rather dislikable character interesting and her gradual move towards redemption believable. As the movie moves into its second half the SF backdrop to the movie becomes clearer: the moon, which is normally permanently exposed to the light of the three suns in the system, is about to pass into the shadow of its gas giant parent planet, at which point a race of vociferous flying creatures who are harmed by light will be released. The horror elements kick in as the characters have to find some way of generating enough light to keep the creatures at bay whilst they make their way across the wasteland to salvation.    These sequences are very tense and handled well. The movie may be low budget, but it makes the most of its resources very well, with the CGI creatures still holding up convincingly a decade later. Even in the middle of these action sequences the director keeps the mutual mistrust and paranoia between the survivors going quite nicely.    Pitch Black (****½) is a genuinely excellent movie, with a well-explored premise and an unusually sophisticated level of characterisation. It also features a highly positive portrayal of Islam, and pretty much all of the actors bring their A-game to the project. The only minor niggles are some stylistic flourishes of the director that are artistically interesting but a bit weird when taken literally (Riddick casually showing up unnoticed in the background of shots as the other characters anxiously search for him at the start of the movie), and the rather one-note writing of the token British character. Otherwise, this is an enjoyable and highly underrated movie.    The film is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).    The sequel is...different.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|Huge HSM fan, loved the movie and the DVD is wonderful.  Love the added scene, wish there were more!
0689861141|5.0|Our preschool kids loved this book and could quote from it. And when the \\"someone turned off the light\\", so did we. We cut the light back on only long enough to finish the book and tuck them into bed. A great way to get little children ready for bedtime!
B001UOVP1S|4.0|This album is what it is.  Timbaland and Chris Cornell.  Both wanted to do something different , both enjoyed making this album, why complain about it.  It does have rhythm and every song is good listen from begining to end it is very good.  Quit whining about how much Chris has changed from soundgarden and Audioslave.  Get over it!!! People move on with other things, too bad you all can't.  All your reviews say is that you don't like Timbaland and R/B or Hip Hop music.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|This film is breathtaking. It takes you places you might not be able to go. With no narration and original fusion music, it's an all encapturing film. The 70 mm lens captures images in a way that puts you right there. I recommend this film to anyone who loves filmography, travel, art and originality. A highly recommended documentary- you won't regret it.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|Not much to say other than the coolest album I own.  Yes it does sound better than any other format.  Get this on Vinyl and you will love it.
0393061310|5.0|I've read this book twice now, the first time was a few years ago. The author successfully, in my opinion, lays out the reasons why societies thrived in some areas and remained static in others. This is no dull history book, it opened my eyes and explained why one civilization was able to become so dominant over others. Explaining how mankind evolved from hunter-gatherers to food producers and why it was only in certain areas where food production took off. Removing from the table racist ideas that were prevalent in the past.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Director/writer John Patrick Shanley measures the quality of mercy in his uncommonly well-crafted 2008 adaptation of his 2004 Broadway hit. One can imagine how well his intimate story must have played onstage as a four-actor chamber piece since the vivid personal interactions raise large questions about morality and organized religion. The title refers to the religious doubt that results when faith is not enough to reconcile suspicion with intellectual certainty. The subject of doubt is a popular priest who could be violating his position of trust and power. The question then becomes whether the severity of an accusation is enough to convict someone of wrongdoing and how the accuser must live with the consequences of raising doubt among others without the burden of proof.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1964, a year after Kennedy's assassination, in a non-segregated Bronx Catholic school. It's a time of great tumult in the church with the Second Vatican sweeping in reforms that prove unsettling to old-school Catholics like Sister Aloysius, the strict school principal who terrorizes the students with her mean-spirited, iron hand tactics. She is offended by ballpoint pens, too much sugar in others' tea, and the possible use of [[ASIN:B000001VNC Frosty The Snowman]] in the holiday pageant. Her adversary is also her immediate superior, Father Flynn, a compassionate young priest who is fully immersed in the daily life of his congregation, particularly with the schoolboys whom he coaches in basketball and in life's lessons. She is suspicious of his motives, and when Sister James, an innocent novice, reports that one of her students, Donald Miller, returned from a meeting with the priest behaving strangely, Sister Aloysius becomes determined to remove him from his post.<br /><br />What Shanley does particularly well with this set-up is ensure we never know the true story and whether Sister Aloysius' assumptions are based in hard evidence. The ensemble cast is superior. It becomes redundant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse. She infuses her vinegary character with welcome humor. As Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to bring enough ambiguity to the priest to make the suspicions palpable, while Amy Adams plays Sister James with her natural perkiness toned down to reflect her character's questioning conscience. As Donald's anguished mother, Viola Davis blazes with quiet authority in an impressive face-off with Sister Aloysius that ends with an unsettling revelation. Shanley brings out all the dramaturgy of his work with full gale force and does not shy away from the dark, somber theme. It's just a good thing the actors make it intensely involving as well.ndant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse.

B001K98MFK|3.0|I'll start out by saying that the movie was well animated, looked beautiful, and the sound was well done.  It created a great atmosphere.  The problem I had was the story was lacking.  It tried to bring a little too much over from the first film.  If you've never seen the first one even, then don't bother with this one.      My largest complaint was that about 50% of the dialog was just random quotes from people throughout history.  The story wasn't fleshed out nearly as well as it could have been either.  I just felt that there wasn't enough to support what they were trying to get at, with the rest of the movie either being holdouts from the first one, or random quotes that aren't related.    So I give it 3 stars, just average.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I was unsure how an unknown Swedish group could do with a BD transfer, and I will admit - I was impressed with everything (almost). From the menu sounds/pic to the amount of audio/sub selections to the DTS. Unfortunately, the extras were mediocre, but the quality of the transfer makes for the only 5-star I have given with a semi-bare BD.<br /><br />The picture was superb throughout, but only if your white balance and related settings are done correctly. The amount of snowscapes and fair skin mingled with blood and darkness makes for a competent test of the display. I had this one playing on a Panasonic 58 and there was a temperant difference in between settings (over-saturation, line blur, etc.).<br /><br />The sound was exquisite. I listened to both the English DTS and the Swedish DTS, and the difference was notable. Mistakenly I had both English subs on with the dub - that was a mess. They should try to hire the same company to do both, it seemed like two different movies so I would recommend to skip the dub version. The outer channels were used extensively, and if anything, turn up the menu (wind, snow, water) to hear some wonderfully subtle decibels. Refresh rate test: the scene where the lights get turned off in the gym.<br /><br />The extras are light, with a seven minute behind the scenes and a pic gallery of our unknown cast. Definitely an owner for the fans of this film, and even with as subtle as the majority of this film is, the channels and display get a fair workout.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Before I watched this movie I knew little about it other than it was nominated for some Oscars.  After watching it I wonder why it got these nominations.  just like Dances with Wolves, evil white men do bad things to the natives, some good white men (women) are sympathetic to the natives, live with them and discover how good the natives are.  The plot can't be more predictable.  the whites (other than the main characters) are all bad, natives are all good.  very politically correct.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|such a great show!  Alan Ball never disappoints, and each episode keeps getting better.  Can't wait for the second season to see what he comes up with next.
B00005JPY2|2.0|\\"Watchmen\\" has the same relation to good cinema as hip-hop has to Beethoven.  Of course, this should not stop you to watch it.  I would wait for the obligatory \\"extended\\" cut, but it is your money.  It has its pleasures, such as the (violent) story of one of the vigilant heroes (Rorschach) and some slick visuals.  The rest is a tired saga of puppets saying supposedly profound stuff, ala \\"Dark Knight\\".  The good thing is that, unless we get \\"Maus\\" on screen, Hollywood must now get their ideas from other sources other than comics (and I am relieved by that).<br />Note: I did not read the comic.  As with any medium, comics can also contain masterpieces that can shape our understanding of ourselves and be tools for a better future. I simply do not trust the way by which Hollywood can handle the best works of this genre, being this film a proof.
0761119752|5.0|We love this book.  The text is fun and entertaining and somehow my two year old knows that when it is over it is time for his bedtime too. Unlike many kids books I think we all enjoy reading it repeatedly. Hope you like it too!
0800132343|4.0|The title tells the story. The movie is an all encompassing story of the  war under-seas; it is not a nice story of heros - but the tale of people  dying for no explainable reason.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This has been available for quite some time now, and still I often find myself playing \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" in my head.  Muse is still not terribly well known in the United States, which is a shame because they are quite possibly one of the most talented bands on the planet right now.<br /><br />This album is, in my opinion, their best so far - and I really liked Absolution.  An aside: in concert, Muse may be the most accurate band since Rush, as they sound exactly like they do on the recording, but in a good way - no mistakes, all the vocals true, no sour notes, etc.  I saw them at Boston University's Agganis Arena in summer 2007, and was blown away by their performance.<br /><br />Muse is not easy to describe; on the one hand I feel like calling them a cross between Pink Floyd and Tool, because of their ethereal production and ability to make tempo and volume changes at all the right times (and for their great songwriting).  On the other hand, their song structure sometimes falls into the category of most modern rock metal, with two choruses, a guitar solo, and strong outro - except that they divert from that formula enough that the label becomes inaccurate.<br /><br />In the end I think I would say that this album is accessible enough for just about anyone, hard enough for the rock metal crowd, sexy enough for the girls, and original enough for the alternative fans.  If we are lucky, there will be much more to come from this tremendously talented group.  There is a reason this band is so popular in Europe that they cut short their tour opening for My Chemical Romance in order to return home for headlining shows: they're THAT good.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Satisfied overall - One improvement that could be made: have the RCA cord that connects to your receiver able to be unplugged at the unit instead of hardwired.  This would enable you to disconnect easily and reconnect to the USB on your computer.
0307387178|5.0|This book touched me like no other.  We all have tendencies to break away from our lives, but it was fascinating to read about someone who actually did it. I love what Krakauer brings to his work.  He's a true visionary.  He really does bring the reader along on his amazing journeys.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you have not seen Dr. Horrible's Sing A Long Blog yet, You should take a minute out of your day and purchase this DVD. It seems to be made locally, so not a mass release I'd imagine. I doubt this will be available forever... and for Ten bucks this is an obvious purchase for anyone thats a fan of NPH or Joss Whedon's past works.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|The more I listen to it the more I love it. Awesome electronic sound, cool vocals, rythms that ressemble life but in harmonized madness.
0156030209|5.0|When I originally saw the front cover of `The Life of Pi' I assumed it was a fantasy book. The artwork is of a young, dark skinned man floating in a seemingly idyllic azure ocean teaming with sea life. His sole companion; a very large Bengal tiger. My initial thought was that the tiger was probably a talking tiger. Let me just say, the tiger does not talk. Here is a perfect example of why it's generally best not to judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />The Life of Pi starts off a bit slow but continues to pick up steam all the way until the stunning ending. My wife's one word description for the book is `haunting'. This one will stay with you. To boil the story down to its core it's a story about a young Indian man who finds himself on a lifeboat, with a 450 pound tiger in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It's a tale of loneliness, struggle and unimaginable suffering. Again, quoting my wife, \\"this book is not for the feint of heart\\". Besides a couple of instances that seem unlikely the book is written as an extremely literal portrayal of the problems one might encounter in staying alive in this situation. Just about everything is dealt with frankly and remorselessly including how does one keep a 450 pound Bengal Tiger from eating you when you are trapped with him on a 27 foot lifeboat. There is no subject too unpleasant including handling the matter of Tiger defecation. The author holds nothing back.<br /><br />Nothing finishes off a great book like a great ending and Yann Martel delivers an extraordinarily memorable one. I tend to enjoy a certain level of ambiguity in the endings of stories and the author has enough respect for the readers to allow us to sort things out for ourselves. Perhaps in the end there is no real answer but often that's the way life is. This may not be a book for everyone. It is harsh and unforgiving but in the end I found it fantastically rewarding.

B00005JPY2|5.0|WHEN I FIRST READ THE BOOKS MANY YEARS AGO I WAS ENTHRALLED AND WONDERED WHY SO FEW FOLKS EVER MENTIONED IT. I HAVE 2 COLLECTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL  PRINTS  OF COMICS  THEY ARE NOW A SUPER VALUE TO ME.  I LOVED THE MOVIE AND THE BLUE PENIS DID NOT BOTHER ME AT ALL.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye recorded this record when I was in the 7th grade. Time has changed many things, but the beauty and power of this music is untouched. Even if one were to ignore the spiritual aspects of Whats Going On, you would be hard pressed to find a finer piece of 20th century music.    To me, the cruel irony is that Gaye's father, who killed him a little over a decade later, desperately wanted Gaye to become the world's greatest gospel singer, and was unable to see that he did, in fact, did just that with this amazing work of fusion. With seemingly no effort, Gaye bridges the gap between God, penthouses and ghetto streets, raising more questions than he answers in the process. Beyond essential...
1423113497|5.0|Loved it!  I bought the series for my 8-year old daughter, but I am the one who ended up reading this (hoping she'll get to it in the next year or so when her tastes mature!).  I loved mythology as a kid, and enjoyed the seamless melding of the classic stories with modern culture.  Fresh, funny, and likeable.  Percy Jackson is a hero for our time!
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Communiqu&eacute; being the Dire Straits 1979 release and their 2nd studio album was a smash hit for the band with #1 in Germany, Sweden and New Zealand. The booklet is quite simple but effective. It contains all the lyrics and presents the muisicians and what they play with photos on the back. 4/5.

B00005QK3W|3.0|Driving Rain being McCartney's 2001 release and was a major disapointment in the charts. In the UK it topped at #46 and whilst it did better in the US (#26) it was also a surprise considering the positive reviews. I find it to be an alright release but it is not outstanding. The booklet is atrocious. The cover photo looks it was shot by some close friend with a cheap digital camera and the rest of the photographs have the same lack of quality. The lyrics are easy to read and for each track we get a list of whom plays what. 3/5.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I might've found the family-bonding & little girl to be cute & adorable, but was disgusted with this filthy piece of garbage after Alan Arkin began cursing disgusting obscenities in front of his grandson & granddaughter in this film.  Unfortunately Hollywood doesn't care about morality & class.  They will exploit children to cash in on something.  I guess if they think it can sell, go ahead & market it.      Admittedly, I am a fan of many R-Rated films, but I believe a line should be drawn & not crossed when the dialogue is raunchy in the presence of a child.  Little Miss Sunshine is also R-Rated & NOT a family movie by any means.  Give it a miss.  One reviewer gave a great recommendation... see National Lampoon's Vacation (or Little Miss Marker (1980)) instead.  (Either are really a far better choice.)
B00000DG1R|5.0|Greatest is a tremendous collection of some of the best hits from an amazing new wave band. Here we get songs like \\"the reflex\\", \\"girls on film\\" , \\"skin trade\\" and \\"union of the snake\\". I was 7 years first time I heard this amazing group and I still love them. 5/5.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This is a very engaging portrayal of the Gaskell novels.  I truly enjoyed this and the most wonderful part was to see how the women were actually so in command of the town and daily life.  As a hobbyist costumer I roared over Imelda Staunton's lace dilemma.  that woman is SO funny. .. .even when she's serious.  Judi Dench is absolutely marvelous as the weaker of the two sisters (can you believe it of strong Judi Dench?) and on the whole, the cast is brilliant--and followers of BBC costume dramas will recognize more than one or two familiar faces.  That might be a turnoff for some but welcome for others.  I received this DVD as a Valentine gift from my husband and will watch it again and again.
B000002UQJ|3.0|Off the Ground being McCartney's 1993 is an ok album but some of the texts are just a bit too political. The lyrics for Looking for Changes is a hoot that talks about animal rights and sounds hokey. Hope of Deliverence is quite a nice track that I remember hearing on the radio back in the day when this album was released. The booklet is a mess filled with shoddy photos, no lyrics but the listing on the back of what each of them play is nice. 3/5.
B000JCEUE6|5.0|There is so much about this product that amazes me. For starters, the music in general is just simply amazing. I bought this album on CD the day of it's release, and it took me nearly three years to actually realize how amazing this album really is. It's such a beautiful, chatchy record...words cant even describe how much I enjoy this record now. This version however brings you even closer to it.    It comes with 6 7\\" icey clear vinyl. One review stated that it annoyed them to have to change the record every five minutes. I personally think the point of doing that is, it makes you pay more attention to the album. If you want the record to keep going, you have to be in front of your record player to get the next song, which I think is brilliant idea. Odds are, if you have this you have either the cd or mp3 as well. If you need it for background music or you just want to relax to it, then use those, for this, your attention needs to be on the record, and I feel that with an album like this, to get everything out of it your attention needs to be on it. On the cd version if you rewind track 1 from the very begining, you get an extra twenty seconds of it...if you put each of the sleeves of this version together it spells out something (you can find out for yourself what it is), and thats just part of the mystery behind this album. I love this album. Pick it up, and if you want to get a closer look at it, buy this version. Did I mention it has an exlusive track on it as well :)
B00127RAJY|4.0|I know this sounds crazy, but I'm only on day 3 and already feel a difference!  I've been working out regularly for the last 10 years and tend to be hard to please b/c workouts aren't challenging or engaging enough, but hers is great.  It's broken up into parts so if a movement starts to feel too hard, you know that you only have a few seconds left.  I would warn anyone who isn't an experienced exerciser that it's OK to take a break even though she discourages it.  This is a good way to get hurt if you're out of shape.  She's got a great balance of all the different important types of exercise and you feel like you've really accomplished something in just 20 minutes!  That's amazing compared to a lot of other so-called fast workouts.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickleback seems to be regressing into some sort of junior high mentality and the music shows it - a once very promising band is now turning out mediocre music - this CD is ok - but only one or two songs are worth paying for, I would pass this one up. Even the cover art is not impressive
B00005JPY2|3.0|I went into this movie hungry for another superhero movie.  It was one of those movies that I just had to see.  I did not read Watchmen the graphic novel, so I really didn't know what I was in for.  But that's part of the fun sometimes.  Unfortunately I cannot say this movie was a pleasant surprise.  The trailer showed me it had potential, which is really all I had to go on.  Call me crazy, but I prefer the traditional superhero movie without the gore and the sex and the bright blue penis.  But on the plus side, the special effects were nice, the fight choreography was pretty good, and some parts were really neat, like Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  He was a cool character.  I especially liked how he could dismantle and suspend things in midair, make clones of himself, teleport, and grow to a ginormous size.  Nevertheless, this is not a movie for children.  Get them a babysitter if you want to see this film.  Should you see this film in the theater, or buy it on DVD?  Tough call.  If you liked the darkness of the last 2 Batman films (with Christian Bale), you are in the ballpark of the dark vibe of Watchmen, but Watchmen has more sex and gore.  Maybe read a few reviews before you decide, unlike me, who just saw the trailer before seeing it.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Nothing to say that others haven't said I am sure, but I think this was a great copy at a great price.  I am not a professional but I have not a single negative to say whatever - just a great old classic and at a great price!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|After I purchased this film on pay per view and sat through a few minutes of it, I regreted my purchase -- this was silly, slapstick, simplistic.  But halfway through, it hit me:  this is a fabulous film.  It's a great ensemble film -- with plenty of stars -- but it was young Brandon Walters, who played Nullah, who stole the show with his wide-eyed wonder, energy, feeing, and \\"cheeky bulls.\\"  He was magic on the screen, so moving and lovable, that I just wanted to hug and kiss him (reminded me a bit of my adorable nephew Layth) -- and adopt him.  He was so precious!  What a gifted little actor.  I hope we will see more of him.  I found myself moved to tears when he was parted from Sarah (Kidman), rescued by Drover (Jackman), and re-united with \\"Mrs. Boss, Mrs. Boss\\" (Kidman).  As a single person, I've learned to re-define family -- and Drover, Kidman, and this little aborigine, Nullah -- though unrelated -- were clearly a family.  Loved it!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This movie depicts the stamina and the power to love which women of all ages possess.  I identify with the young women who find true joy in a shared friendship with another woman.  I connect heart to heart with the middle-aged woman, played by Kathy Bates, as she tries to resurrect her true identity which has been stifled by never ending service to a self centered husband.  My heart melts as the wiser kinder older woman, played by Jessica Tandy, worms her way into the view's heart as one who understands life and is willing to share herself and her memories of a time gone by.  My all-time favorite movie!
0425220931|4.0|While working at Kinko's in downtown Nashville, I often saw Victor Wooten come in and run his own copies. He seemed nice, quirky, always engaged but moments from wandering off mentally to artistic places. I knew of his musical prowess, and was impressed by his unpretentious demeanor.<br /><br />When someone suggested to me that I read \\"The Music Lesson,\\" I jumped at it, thinking I'd find out more about this legendary bass player's background, discography, and upbringing. This was not the case. This is not an autobiography by any means, and neither is it a by-the-numbers look at music. It is, however, a captivating tale told in a breezy manner. Within a few pages, my disappointment had turned to enjoyment.<br /><br />Yes, \\"The Music Lesson\\" becomes progressively more new-agey as it moves along, but Wooten reins in those aspects to keep pointing at the practical, though thoroughly unconventional, means of getting to know Music and becoming a partner in the creative aspect. Though the wording is different than I might use, many of the concepts are ones I've experienced as a novelist, tapping into a creative pulse that is much bigger than my own, letting go of the book- and head-knowledge to find something much more fulfilling in the artistic vein.<br /><br />I'm not a musician, but the ideas here (particularly in the first half) still work within a literary context. This is a high concept book about art and music, going against the grain of \\"practice-practice-practice\\" and \\"study-study-study.\\" I believe that we are all made in the image of the Creator, and in that sense I can relate to Wooten's ideas, to the thrill of tapping into ideas bigger than our own, walking hand and hand with the Creator, and putting to use the minds we've been given.<br /><br />I wish I'd read \\"The Music Lesson\\" while still working at Kinko's so that I could have discussed it with Victor himself. I can imagine his bright smile and that twinkle in his eye. While Victor and I would agree to disagree on a few things, I think we'd find common ground as artists. Maybe, just maybe, I'll see him walking an alleyway in the near future, or crouching beneath a bridge with his Uncle Clyde.'d find common ground as artists. Maybe, just maybe, I'll see him walking an alleyway in the near future, or crouching beneath a bridge with his Uncle Clyde.
B000H5TH1Q|1.0|I expected more. I was extremely dissatisfied with the content of this movie. The story line was poor and an obvious duplicate of Alfred Hitchcocks' \\"Rear Window\\" - with a raunchy twist. I do not advise anyone to waist their money on this product.
B001GQACGO|1.0|If Beyoncé were truly as \\"bootylicious\\" as she claimed to be, then there's no reason this album should sound so half-a**ed. She tried to disguise it by releasing it in a two-disc format but I'm already hip to that scheme.    So what is it exactly that makes this such a lousy listen? Well for starters, the first disc is completely lethargic. Some people might call it \\"subdued\\" but don't be fooled, it's a euphemism. For now, let's ignore the fact that \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was ripped off from BC Jean, a singer-songwriter struggling to make a name for herself, and focus solely on the music. The aforementioned song is decent enough, albeit a little too similar to the gentle guitar-strum pop of Fergie's 2007 mega-hit \\"Big Girls Don't Cry.\\" Moving on...we have \\"Halo,\\" a stunningly beautiful power ballad that Beyoncé 's powerful pipes do justice to, although the song bears a strong resemblance to Leona Lewis's brand of melodrama (perhaps because this song was written for Lewis). Beyond that, we have a glut of wholly unremarkable dirges in which Beyoncé mistakes languor for prestige. The faux-artistic re-working of Schubert's classic, \\"Ave Maria,\\" does not add to Beyoncé 's credibility either. Nice try.    The second disc sounds like a parody of black people. Of course for every Barack Obama, there's a Beyoncé setting everyone two steps back. The fact that \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" won so much critical praise is an indication that standards for music in the 21st century have declined drastically. Then we've got songs like \\"Diva\\" or \\"Video Phone\\" in which Beyoncé puts on the ghetto pretense and glamorizes the thug mentality. As if marrying Jay-Z somehow makes her less whitewashed? It's bad enough she sold out her \\"independent woman\\" mantra to be his trophy wife, but now she's trying to ape him too? Any self-respecting black woman would disown Beyoncé. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Radio\\" are excellent songs though, I've got to admit. A few more Euro-dance tracks could havegone a long way in saving this album from the atrocity that it ended up being.    Okay, so some people might argue that I overanalyzed the album and that it should just be enjoyed for what it is--a guilty pleasure, but the truth is what was once cute and fun for Beyoncé has now become awfully tedious and insulting to our intelligence. It shouldn't have to come down to unethically stealing songs from other artists, gouging your fans with gratuitous packaging, or desperately rushing out your album to exploit the holiday season sales in order to stay relevant. Let's hope, sooner than later, that Beyoncé's pedestal will \\"collapse and be gone.\\" Hey, if she can steal from Fergie, so can I.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Chasing pavements heard on Gammies first time.. bought album next day.  Rare and unusual lyrics combined with voice of range and possibilities. A fun and surprising album, risky and rewarding. Glad I bought the album for the variety.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The video portion of this BD dvd is nothing short of stunning. The audio is neither DTS HD master audio or DD TrueHD. It is an unspectacular DD 5.1  I realise that DD 5.1 is still acceptable, but almost seems unbalanced when used in conjuction with the HD video.  Still, it's a must buy. This series (4 disks) is quite remarkable and  definately raises the HD video bar.
B001LEHXHW|5.0|Love the fairytale. Stephenie Meyer is a wonderful author. My 2nd favorite book of the Twilight Saga. Hopefully this won't be the last we hear of Edward and Bella. I really enjoyed the additional vampire clans and the supernatural potential for a future movie...can't wait. Excellent!
0439023483|5.0|I rarely give a book review, but I have to say that \\"The Hunger Games\\" kept me turning pages well past time to go to sleep. I am not a young adult, pretty far from it, a grandma, actually. But I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I am anxiously waiting for the sequel to come out.<br />I would caution parents to read this book before they let their child read it. That way the parent can judge for him/herself if the material is appropriate for their particular child. I think though, that most 14 year olds and up would handle it fine.<br />Good book, good read. I give it 5 stars.
B001RTIHPS|4.0|Look I will admit the series has seen better episode arcs. And I am also positive they are trying to wrap up Smallville so there won't be a huge fan out-cry and online petitions to bring the show back. But that is no reason to pan the season and the series.     Smallville has to be one of the longest running live-action superhero television shows out there. Honestly besides Watchmen, this is all DC has going for it. ;) Smallville's use of recycled sci-fi actors makes me feel nostalgic and I enjoy seeing fresh characters even if they are for only one episode.     They are doing the best they can with what they have, and I think it is worth the time to watch it. Enjoy each episode as you never know if it will be the last. :D
B000002JBG|5.0|Ever since I was 6 when this came out, Space Jam has been a childhood favorite, and I loved the music! I just don't know why it took me this long to buy it! My favorite songs so far are I Believe I Can Fly, Space Jam, Fly Like An Eagle, Buggin' and Basketball Jones. I highly recommend the SPACE JAM SOUNDTRACK!!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved this book, and the other ones (Pretties, Specials, and even Extras).  These books have a story that constantly demands your attention, while making you question society and your own life.  The characters are relatable and loveable.  Like twilight you will quickly be picking sides for team tally, shae, zane, and david.  If your looking for a good book, that actually makes you think, I highly recommend This Series! Its one of my favorites! :D
0142000671|5.0|I read this book with my 17 year old son for school.  He was reluctant to get started and the dialect in the book was challenging for him.  However, the author's word choice, symbolism, and snapshots created through the words provided excellent learning opportunities for my son.  We journaled each chapter writing a summary, reaction and predictions.  I enjoyed watching him grow throughout the book of friendship and the infectious power of dreams.
0439023483|5.0|Loved it! I could NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN! If you loved Graceling, you love this book even better! I was soooooooo mad when i finished it! I can't wait for the sequal! READ IT! You won't be disappointed!
B001FBSMF8|3.0|I'm a huge Soundgarden, Audioslave and CC solo album fan (and have seen CC perform live a number of times in all three contexts), so I am came at this record ready to be open to his collaboration with Timbaland.  After about 10 full listens to this record, my current opinion is that being open is well worth it.      If one comes at this release as if someone had said, \\"Hey, there's this guy named Chris Cornell who just made a record with Timbaland; you should check it out,\\" I suspect he would like this effort.  If one can not let go of CC's past as a reference point, the new CD is probably never going to be one's cup of tea, because this work is a substantial departure from anything he's done in the past.      All of that said, my 3-star rating (ie, versus a higher one) is due to the fact that the quality of the writing strikes me as uneven across this record. I love tracks 6-12 (and they sound better the louder you play them, so get yourself some alone time in your car), but find myself waiting to get through the first half of the record to get to the latter tracks.      Punchline:  Buy the record and give it a generous number of listens.  It gets under your skin.  You won't regret the purchase (even if you skip a track or two from time to time).
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Received this little gem by sheer happenstance. A buddy burned two copies for another friend, and I ended up with extra. Suffice it to say that the Gods of Rock smiled on me that day. It's like they made this in the back room of some run down strip club in the bowels of the deep South, and it just worked. Boy did it ever. I'm in love with the vocal stylings reminiscent of one of the classic rock greats, the sugary sweet/grainy gutter melodies, crunching guitar riffs, and unapologetically heavy, yet always appropriate bass lines. Never really paid them much attention before but now that I have this album I am hooked. In my opinion absolutely no filler tracks, and for me this holds the distinction of being one of those rare finds in which I genuinely enjoy each track from beginning to end. If you love classic and indie rock this one album will satisfy your musical sweet tooth simultaneously.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic the movie was all the critics thought it would be. It was a really sad movie and it captured the hearts of millions around the world. A little long but that was the only negative for this movie.
1400082773|5.0|I so very much enjoyed this autobiography of President Barack Obama.    It was quite inspiring.  It awoke in my being so many images I had forgotten of my own experiences traveling abroad when I was a youth seeking my Self.  I am very proud to be American born and proud to know that our President represents my views and insight of people, and our inate responsibility to mankind.  Hats off to the Chief!
B00008G8M4|5.0|This movie launched Will Smith's career. This movie was also funny, sad, and happy all together.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is a great Nirvana album. You could listen to this about 20 times and wouldn't get tired of any songs! The best song on this album is Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you are buying this album you would be buying an awesome album! The song Drain You is another great song. If you like this album I would recommend The MTV Unplugged In New York.
0385340990|4.0|I read reviews about this book earlier on Amazon but never got a chance to order it.  I just now received this book from a swap and I must say that it was delightful.<br /><br />When I first opened the book, I was a little skeptical. The story is told through many letters (and some telegrams and other narratives) amongst a finite group of people.  Juliet, an author, travels from WWII war torn London to the isle of Guernsey.  She made this trip in response to unsolicited correspondence from a particular man on the island looking for a particular book. She helps him find this book and thus the story ensues... Juliet, looking for a new book to write, finds a group of people that survived the German Occupation on Guernsey. They tell her their story. She falls in love with the island and the people.<br /><br />Previous reviews have laid out the facts rather well, so I won't delve into them here. I can only say that this is a wonderful read - quite unexpectedly delightful. I had a very hard time putting it down.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Amazon's review claims that Requiem For a Dream teaches us nothing that any sane person doesn't already know.  But that isn't the purpose of great art.  Does Hamlet teach us anything that we didn't already 'know'?  The power of a great piece of art is that it can make an obvious truth viscerally real and palpable again, even if we've heard it a thousand times.  Drugs are bad, addiction is bad.  Yes.  But does that adequately sum up the experience of Requiem For a Dream?  Not at all.  Aronofsky's film might not say anything 'new,' but it finds one of the most effective way of saying it.  That's where its power lies.
B001GM28HO|5.0|After hearing Lady GaGa's name, I had to see what a Lady GaGa was.  Looked her up on a music site and listened to a few songs.  This woman is very talented.  I am not a huge fan of dance/electronic music, but Lady Gaga's voice is incredible!  I hope she has a long career and keeps making quality music.
0140120416|4.0|As a Russian language teacher I can give 4 stars to New Penguin Course. Why 4 stars?  1. Material is presented very systematically and in a logical way.  2. This book has a fair amount of grammatical/conversational exercises  3. Book has  communicative approach which is essential when you learn a foreign language.  Why not 5 stars?  1. There are no CDs to this book. Listening skills are very important because you need to have an audio model of a language.  2. The material is mostly presented in a form of a text. There are no grammar tables that would allow you to comprehend the material easier.  3. The number of exercises is not enough.  I use this book with my students as a base and provide a lot of other materials in addition.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Denzel Washington has woven the subculture of social fabric, that of the Black South, into a much greater universal spirit -- into the Spirit of enternal principles of Truth, Justice in this film.  He creates on the screen the character that Americans all love -- the James Dean, the John Wayne, the lone fighter who struggles against all odds around him to become singularly victorious and to ultimately change the very social fabric that was holding him back.  The victorious underdog is a classic icon of American film and has inspired a dogged determination that lead people to real-life success.  Denzel Washington takes an element of history, which is ostensibly a subculture -- that of the Black South, and illustrates that at its heart is it really captured the spirit of the American Culture -- the spirit of determination, dedication, honor, justice and, ultimately, victory.  This movie inspired me deeply -- it rekindled my love for freedom, democracy and Denzel. He's an extraordinary film director and actor.<br />I had never heard of Melvin B. Tolson, Samantha Booke, Henry Lowe and James Farmer before this film and I am indebted to Director Denzel for bringing them into my life.  This film is history, American spirit and awe-inspiring drama.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I would give this a 5 because for the price, I'm extremely happy with these. They're lightweight, produce wonderful sound quality, and I can sort of use them at the gym. There is a flaw that they do kind of get looser when I'm using them on the treadmill, so the music gets softer and softer as I work out. But they're also really comfortable to wear and I can always just push it back in my ears after a while.
B001AX9DT0|4.0|Ray LaMontagne goes for the atmospherics on his third album, marking a major departure from the sparer sounds of his first two. The amazing [[ASIN:B0002S947K Trouble]] and the brokenhearted hurt of [[ASIN:B000GPIPVU Till the Sun Turns Black]] have been a steady diet for me since hearing Ray play a folk festival a few years back, and \\"Gossip In The Grain\\" still mostly delivers the goods. I suspect that producer Ethan Johns, who gave the [[ASIN:B000MRA3NU Kings of Leon]] a heavy dose of reverb, did the same to Ray and upped the oomph factor on a few of the songs here.<br /><br />However, the soulful Ray that emulated the likes of Joe Cocker and Van Morrison bursts through on \\"Gossip's\\" first single, the horn-propelled \\"You Are The Best Thing.\\" It rates with \\"Trouble\\" as one of Ray's best songs. Those looking for sweet seduction will find it on \\"Winter Birds.\\" I absolutely love the pulsing blues of \\"Henry Nearly Killed Me.\\" That song alone makes me want to hear him try more in this direction.<br /><br />However, for the first time, there are missteps. \\"Meg White\\" is funny once or three times. But if goes on far too long, and I now skip the track when if comes up. The back-porch picking on \\"Hey Me Hey Mama\\" is an interesting diversion and is growing on me...but it is an acquired pleasure. John's production is also important, in that producer and artist did not succumb to the loudness wars, which could have crushed the fragility of some of Ray's more spartan numbers. \\"Gossip In The Grain\\" is the third excellent album from Ray LaMontagne, one of Americana's finest artists.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles has made tons of great music. It is almost impossible to rate one from the other. Kind of Blue,Porgy an Bess,Sketches of Spain, doo-bop and on and on and on. But in my opinion this is the best, having lasted the test of time.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am one of the few that had never heard of Charlaine Harris or her Southern Vampire Series.  What made me a fan was HBO's series.  The True Blood Series, based on Ms Harris' Southern Vampire Series of books, has truly made Ms Harris a very rich woman.  It is Alan Ball that has brought the new found attention to Ms Harris' books.  As for Alan Ball, he is a superb creator of drama with a quirk (American Beauty, 6 Feet Under, et al) and has taken the Sookie mystique and made her into a TV heroine for the masses.<br />After the airing of the second episode, I immediately logged on to Amazon.com and ordered the 7 paperback books that were available.  Later I logged on and purchased book 8 because I was unwilling to wait 6 months for the mass market paperback release.  So, because of True Blood on HBO, I am a fan of Ms Harris' books.<br />And the kicker is this:  Even though I have all 12 episodes of True Blood plus the 1-hour Special safely archived on my TiVo, I am purchasing the DvD of the first season too.<br /><br />Alan Ball and Anna Paquin RULE!
0684859106|5.0|I recently tried Magnolia's in NYC and went twice more during my 4-day stay...it was TO DIE FOR.  My sister pulled up a recipe of one of the cakes we had and made it...it turned out just like the one we had in the bakery.  I am a cake lover--I will eat any cake any day over anything else, so when I had Magnolia's I knew what I was eating--complete heaven!  I am buying BOTH of the bakery cookbooks and not worrying about getting fat over it...totally worth it!
B001FBSMF8|2.0|So I've heard a few people talk about Chris Cornell's \\"versatility\\" with respect to this album, and while I'm sure he's gained a few new teenaged fans, I don't think any of them have any real idea about his actual versatility.<br /><br />I've heard versatility from Mr. Cornell. I've heard bone-rattling screams, and I've heard falsetto croons. I've heard wistful, angry, doleful, happy, and a few other odd emotional concepts in between. I've heard fast and punky; I've heard slow and soulful. Chris Cornell has been a versatile artist for awhile, but in so doing, he's always kept it . . . real. You could tell it was him, that anything new he put out was something that's always been there, just needing a conduit.<br /><br />This album does not qualify. I can't detect one solitary emotion within any of the project's 13 tracks - most likely because the shoddily-looped, bass-drunk beats are drowning it all out. Timbaland obviously has at least a tiny shred of talent with a MIDI controller - I'd like to know if this is all a complete ruse, if he stole a sample of Chris Cornell's voice, puked it through a vocoder, and quite libelously attached the poor man's name to the utter swill that emerged on the other side.<br /><br />As for expectations, sure; as a fan, I had expectations. That's what happens when you're an artist with fans. They come to expect quality. Maybe some expect the exact same record they enjoyed, over and over again, but most fans are reasonable enough to simply expect an established level of quality, the level they're used to, the kind that made them love that artist in the first place. If I wanted to listen to some hip-hop boy band, I'd flip on the local top 40 station and have myself lobotomized. I am extremely, extremely disappointed in this album, and really only have one question: Mr. Cornell, where did you go?
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Warner Brothers did a fantastic job creating these films in a Hi Def format. I am not a huge fan of Batman Forever or Batman and Robin, but the movies are a spectacle to behold. The first Batman is classic, there is no topping \\"Jaaack\\" as Joker, sorry Ledger fans, he cannot be compared to Nicholson's talents, nor his movie to the original story of Batman. The Blu Ray disc enhances every detail on the movies so well you will notice things that you have never picked up on before. Ahhh.....the beauty of Blu Ray.     Amazon priced this set nicely, and the price for the set of movies ($84.00) is fair to me. It equates to $21 a disc which includes all the special features on each disc. Not to mention free two day shipping. If I were shopping for these separately, I would end up driving to every retail chain in town selling Blu Ray discs to find the four because the unpopular Batman movies will be the only ones available. Don't forget to include the fuel cost for driving all over the county and tax on each disc. And you probably will not buy them at $21 a pop.     Another good thing about this set is the price is not marked up by including a gimmicky \\"box\\" or \\"tin\\" or whatever the \\"container of the week\\" is. This set is bundled in a cool little three piece cardboard sleeve that encases the four discs in their respective Blu Ray cases. It is easy to open and select the movie you choose to watch, and it will display nicely. All in all I feel Warner Brothers did a quality job with this release and Amazon has a price that I will not complain about.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This was not just a 2 DVD set focusing on Bob Dylan.  This was an overview of the music that shaped his life and music.  They cover many different sounds and genres, and show how it affected Dylan's changing sound throughout the years.      Don't expect a 2 hour concert of Dylan. Expect something amazing, a musical history lesson.
B00026WU4G|5.0|Bob Dylan pursues love, politics and religion in what many critics termed a \\"comeback\\" album after his fabulous trilogy of gospel releases.<br /><br />Produced by Mark Knopfler, the October 27, 1983, release reached #20 on the Billboard album chart and delves heavily into the world chess match of superpowers and the emerging wannabes - Union Sundown, License to Kill, Neighborhood Bully - with an intriguing song on Dylan being Dylan, I and I.<br /><br />But the gospel numbers - Man of Peace, Jokerman - are essential Dylan, as the lyrics for both are enchantingly brilliant. Sweetheart Like You and Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight capture the essence of an eternal search for love.<br /><br />Sly Dunbar (d), Robbie Shakespeare (b), Mick Taylor (g), Knopfler (g) and Alan Clark (k) propel the lyrics to wonderful heights. Hardly a \\"comeback\\" album, it is a worthy successor of the gospel trilogy, while mostly taking aim at timeless world issues.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I love Gavin Degraw and this album is amazing. The stripped bonus cd lets you hear Gavin at a raw level. You can hear the passion for music he has...it's awesome.
B001GM0GNC|5.0|Yep, the packaging is flimsy, but what do we buy DVD's for?  What we have here is an astounding effort by three innovative musicians who could have receded quietly into history.  Instead they put aside their differences, reworked and rehoned their songs, hired some top-notch camera and production people, and went on a blazing world tour captured on DVD for everyone to enjoy forever.  What's not to like?  This is a so much better production than the Synchonicity Concert video, annoyingly filmed and edited by Godley and Creme and crew.    Although the set list is closely the same as the 1983 Syncronicity tour, Andy Summers now breaks out guitar solos to expand many of their songs, something that sounds pretty good to my ears. Another critic called him \\"paunchy\\" - hmmm, he is 65 years of age here, and his bad habit of watching his own fingerings accentuates a bit of face flab, but hey - the guy still can jump from Stewart's drum riser, play some fabulous riffs, and work his effects pedals like few can.    Sting's singing voice is powerful despite his own 56 years of age.  His vocal range maybe isn't as wide as 20 years ago, but his clarity isn't diminished. Well maybe a little bit late in the concert, but he absolutely wails on the opening numbers, Message in a Bottle, and Synchronicity II.  His bass playing seems more fluid and melodic than ever, and as part of this 3-piece band, is so important to the rhythm.  More than anyone, Sting set aside his robust personality a bit to co-exist with his bandmates for the practice sessions and tour, which I give him credit for.  I'm sure he didn't need this reunion to make a house payment.      Stewart Copeland has always been a great drummer in my opinion, there is never a mis-timed drum beat or awkward fill.  His work really seems the same as 30 years ago, thunderous and expansive.  Without Stewart, the songs wouldn't be as unique, they wouldn't sound like The Police.    In spite of my enthusiasm for this, there are some production downsides.  Obviously there has been some audio sweetening.  Personally, I wouldn't mind, if the original concert audio was included as an option on the DVD.  Most notably for me are the altered backing vocals by Andy and Stewart, they seem to have been replaced by an electronic version. I would rather hear them and their mistakes, or at least have the option to do so.  As to dubbed instruments, it's hard to for me to tell, Sting has foot pedals for synthesizer and bass and we don't always get to see him using them.  Andy as well has multiple effects pedals.  Stewart, I'm not sure about, there is some percussion work audible that he is not playing - especially noticable on \\"Wrapped around your finger\\".  Certainly he or one of the others could have pressed a pedal to make that happen on stage, but who knows.      For anyone who wants to learn more about these guys and how they create their music, I can also recommend the DVD \\"The Police - Every Breath you Take\\" for the bonus items.  Included is a mini-documentary - hosted by former Squeeze keysman Jools Holland - called Police in Montserrat.  Quite funny, and Sting, Stewart, and Andy each describe where it all came from and how they do it.  Also on the same DVD, see the band at it's earliest where they perform \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" and \\"Next to You\\" live in 1978 on The Old Grey Whistle Test, a terrific 70's British TV show.
B001DEVZUG|1.0|I'm a fan and the song selection was good but the format and options was so annoying. Basically played the thing once and put away never to be played again. So if you want to add to your library...
B0013N7AD8|4.0|I don't see any reasons to review the movies here - you already know what you think of them. The movie is packaged in a very thin cardboard box that opens from the top (similar to From the Earth to the Moon DVD). Inside are 4 super slim blu-ray cases designed to compliment each other. The 5th disc is the digital copy of Batman.<br /><br />I have watched all four movies and picture quality only gets better as the movies go on. The picture quality of Batman is excellent, you can't ask for a whole lot more from a movie this old. Detail is very fine, it becomes obvious when sets are being used, you can see Batman's strings holding him up when he flies. There are few artifacts and little grain, even though the movie is mostly dark. The sound is fine. It could be better, but using my 5.1 setup it sounds great. $85, as it costs now is way too much in my opinion, but I bought it because I expect it to go down in the next 45 days so I can get a price adjustment at Best Buy.
1582701709|4.0|I find it pretty funny that this book with its simple message that joy, love, and gratitude will create a better life for us than dwelling on the negative, is getting pages of lengthy negative rant reviews. Personally, it helped me through a dark day or two, so I recommend reading it. Take from it what you will.
B0006GANN2|2.0|Based on the true story of how two New York police detectives, \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), uncovered a drug smuggling operation between France and America.    Given its five Oscar wins (including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director), it appears that, back in 1971, \\"The French Connection\\" was considered very highly and even today it still enjoys a very high reputation, but after sitting through this movie, I can't, for the life of me, figure out why. With the exception of the ending (which is a bit of an anti-climax), \\"The French Connection\\" isn't a terrible movie, but it's not all that great either. The film is slow moving and didn't engage me at all. There is little tension present and the script didn't provide me with any means of relating to or caring about \\"Popeye\\" Doyle. The car chase, which everyone talks about, is disappointing by modern standards, and although I would agree that Gene Hackman is an Oscar-worthy actor, I don't think he did anything Oscar-worthy in this film.     What makes the reputation of \\"The French Connection\\" even harder to understand is that it was released the same year as \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"The Last Picture Show\\", beating both of these films to win its many accolades. I recently saw \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" for the first time and I was blown away by just how incredible that film is, even more than 40 years after it was made. If \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" were released today, I am certain that it would be just as highly regarded as it was in 1971, whereas I doubt that the same thing can be said about \\"The French Connection\\". If you do watch this film, keep in mind that, even when it was made, film makers were capable of better.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|There's a reason why they performed this album in it's entirety for every show on the \\"Matter of Life and Death World Tour\\" 2006-2007. It simply is their BEST effort since the mighty \\"Powerslave\\" which gave us \\"Live After Death\\", the greatest live album of all time. It makes sense that they would revisit their old material on the \\"Somewhere Back in Time Tour\\" 2008-2009, because I can't imagine any new material topping this album at all.
0790729350|5.0|Glad I bought this product,excellent,like a time capsule getting openned,brings back memories of past days that I kind of forgot but now remember.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|I stumbled on this treatment of James Lee Burke's \\"In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead\\" on a Netflix order--I had not even known the movie was being filmed nor that it had been released straight to video. Being a devoted reader of everything Burke writes and particularly of his Dave Robicheaux series, I immediately ordered and viewed it.    \\"In The Electric Mist\\" gets a lot right and less wrong.  Yes the plot has holes in this version and yes, some of the characterizations will be less than fleshed out for non Burke fans.  But this is also a strength in that this film has more resonance with the poetic visions that Burke paints in his words than certainly \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" did.      It is atmospheric and moody; indeed it was filmed in the murky depths of Louisiana parishes and bayous.  The cinematography is startling at time with wonderful panoramas of deep and textured colors that make the viewer think the scenes must be painted. The characters, whether extras in the background or featured leads, are believable and reflective of the area.  The much appreciated background music is filled with moody Cajun, blues, and zydeco sounds that again are reflective of the Louisiana milieu.      The casting was inspired from Tommy Lee Jones as Dave Robicheaux to John Goodman as a malevolent Southern mobster to Levon Helm as the Confederate General, John Bell Hood.  Mary Steenburgen does well in an underwritten role as Dave's supportive wife.  Having traveled a lot in the New Orleans and Louisiana areas, I was very satisfied with the portrayals of the characters and the places.    Lastly, the video was relatively faithful to Burke's depiction of Dave Robicheaux, especially his deep and continuing self introspection that often approaches cynicism but also ultimately values redemption of the human spirit.  Dave is portrayed with all his baggage as he struggles with his inner demons, most notably, drinking and violence.  Even with its warts, I highly recommend this effort not only to Burke/Robicheaux fans, but also to fans of Southern atmospheric mysteries and thrillers.
0316017922|4.0|This review is based upon the audio book.    Malcolm Gladwell provides many detailed case studies and in-depth analysis to justify his hypothesis:     Success in any field depends on three critical factors:  Sustained Hard Work + Cultural Background + Lucky Breaks     Just like clouds are necessary but not sufficient for rain (my analogy), similarly each of the three critical factors are necessary but not sufficient for attaining success.    Yes, the last 1/3 of the book gets ponderous and repetitive, other than that Malcolm is a good writer
B00026WUAU|5.0|With personal drama beginning to sweep into his professional career, Bob Dylan took a huge artistic risk by revamping his sound with a large band and female vocalists for this album that delves directly to the heart and soul.<br /><br />Changing of the Guards; We Better Talk This Over; Baby, Stop Crying and Is Your Love in Vain? are heavy emotional rides over a rocky trail of love lost and the rotting away of a relationship. Senor (Tales of Yankee Power) is a gem, while New Pony is one tough blues number.<br /><br />The album reached #11 on the Billboard album chart and is showing the way to a special introspection that will be explored through a trio of gospel releases. Though very personal in nature, this album speaks to a listener who takes the time to carve a path on a trail of reflection.
1589944607|5.0|Purchased this game a couple months ago, but have enjoyed playing and using it ever since it arrived at my doorstep.  The game seemed a little intimidating at first (usually all Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) are) but once we started playing, it was really easy to pick up.  Each game session is completely different and allows you to have to cooperate with other players and think on your feet.  FFG did a great job with creating this game based on a tv series that I really like.    Along with being a balanced and well-thought-out game, the game pieces themselves are made with quality materials.  The tiny ships have a lot of detail to them and the gameboard is made with sturdy material.  Quality materials will ensure many more uses!    Probably the only negative thing to me about the game is the aspect of the \\"Sympathizer Card\\".  It's a bit confusing, but you can play some variants without using the card (avoiding the confusion altogether).    Overall a great game to play and own.  Especially since the series is almost over, this game can definitely fill the void for a little while.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I saw this on PBS a few nights ago and it blew my mind!  To be honest, I have never heard of him before, and the thought of watching a trumpet concert would not usually spark my interest--but this was AMAZING!!!  The variety of vocal guests added such an incredibly dynamic to his performance.  I loved all of it, but especially \\"I got you under my skin.\\" My twelve year old son is starting junior high this coming fall, and met the band director at his new school last night.  He is trying to decide between the tuba, trombone, and trumpet!  I can't wait for him to see this!
B0000041CZ|5.0|I first listened to Friedrich Gulda's recording of The Well-Tempered Clavier II, after borrowing it from my piano teacher and I was so overwhelmed by this performance that i ordered both vol.I & II from amazon.com as soon as I could! Gulda's perfomance is to me the exact way Bach piano works ought to sound: utmost precision, sensitive yet restrained dynamics (don't forget these works were written when the piano was going through an evolutionary phase, they're not supposed to sound romantic), subtle use of the pedal, well-chosen tempi. The interpreter's stunning techinque allows each voice to be treated equally (whis is not the easiest thing to do on the piano!), so that one can really understand and appreciate the contrapuntal structure of the works, especially the fugues. All in all, I totally recommend Gulda's Well-Tempered Clavier to anyone who wishes to listen to a recording truely faithful to the baroque character of Bach's piano masterpiece.

0060764899|4.0|The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe  By C.S. Lewis  Review by Cameron J. Humpherys  In this marvelous book by C.S. Lewis, The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, the settings are the Professor's house and Narnia. Narnia is a magical land where animals can talk and an evil Witch who thinks she's  Queen made it forever winter but never Christmas.   The main characters in this book are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. These four siblings along with Aslan, a great lion with great powers, work to help free Narnia from the oppressive Witch, who has ruled by fear for a long time.   When Aslan gave himself up to die instead of Edmund to appease a deep magic he activated an even deeper magic which kept him alive. Aslan being alive and the Witch not knowing it made it so that he could un-freeze those that the Witch had turned to stone. Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.   My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.   One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, \\"I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened.\\" But at the end of the story he is kind and good.

B00005JO20|2.0|a big let down for me after the wonderfull LOTR trilogy from director jackson...  a lot of trouble has gone into this but ultimately the film falls way short of the mark lost amidst the cgi technology it seems determined to ram down your throat..it is like watching a computer game in parts.... a shame as it could have been so much better
B001KL3GZO|5.0|I have owned nearly every digital version of this album.<br />I had the first one from the wrong tape. I then got the Gold 'corrected' version, then I got the mass release of the 're-master'. I bought the SACD.<br />Now this re-master (by the same folks who did the first re-master).<br /><br />OK... so here's my take.<br />Let's forget the first CD. It was a mistake.<br /><br />The Gold was the right speed, but the two track master used is just dead and the mix is awful, allowing too much echo in some parts, not enough presence, and some passages of horn are just nearly impossible to hear well.<br /><br />The first re-master was a revelation. The horns were right up front, the balance was greatly improved and you could tell that they remixed it from the original 3-track. I loved the new Alternate Take of Flamenco Sketches. But something was wrong. This was obviously meant for the iPod crowd, and not for audiophiles. The channels had been normalized to HOT and without using any dynamic compression. The loud horn passages were all clipped severely, resulting in a viciously harsh presentation.<br /><br />The SACD is a joke. They made this a 5.1 disc for some stupid reason, adding echo - reverb - whatever, in the rear channels. Whaaaa? Come on, I just wanted to hear the original 3-track masters as faithfully as possible. Ugh... Even being DSD does not help this mess.<br /><br />Finally... this last release is done right. The balance is correct. There is NO clipping. It's near perfect in its presence. The middle channel is well represented (phantom), and the soundstage is wonderful. The horns have warmth that the clipped version just couldn't create. This is finally done properly... by the same folks. So how come they got all the others so wrong??<br /><br />So... even if you have the last releases, this one (the 50th Anniversary) has to be purchased because it is the only one that is correct. It is the only one that actually represents the best possible 2-channel CD-quality mix. Obviously it's not perfect in that it is still only 16bit - 44.1khz, but it's a vast improvement.<br /><br />Enjoy!y 16bit - 44.1khz, but it's a vast improvement.    Enjoy!

B000OYC3J8|3.0|White Stripes-Icky Thump ***<br /><br />Icky Thump is without a doubt the most diverse and experimental album The White Stripes have ever released. Icky Thump is also the weakest and worst album that The White Stripes have ever released. The whole Spanish American theme runs very thin and tired by about the time that 'Conquest' (only track #4) begins to play.<br /><br />For the most part the instrumentation is also extremely weak in comparison to the other releases from the band. The title track being the only real track on the album that is a true classic and worthy of any merritt. The rest of the album largely plays together and feels like one piece.<br /><br />Regardless of the running together of the tracks and themes there still isn't a single weak track on the album. Every track is good, not great mind you but good. But because of the undisguisable tracks it feels like nothing more than an average album because nothing is really that memorable.<br /><br />Icky Thump would have made an incredible Ep, though that doesn't really seem like Jack Whites style.
0060899220|3.0|I enjoy Mr.Bourdains' TV show and thought it would be interesting to hear alittle about where he came from (the uncensored version, anyway) and I was very pleasantly surprised by his behind the scenes stories about the kitchens we never get to see.  I came away with a new respect for the business of cooking and the people who serve my meals, I think you will too.
B000UCYER8|2.0|I found it to be a very boring book.  There's only so much you can say about punctuation...
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie. It's main theme are 2 women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet who exchange homes during the Christmas holiday to escape painful relationships. I think that everybody can relate to the love stories by the 4 main characters in this movie, Jack Black and Jude Law are the men they meet in their new locations who are having their own problems (aren't we all). The house exchanges are between Surrey, England and Los Angeles. I thought that the plot was unique which is so hard because \\"it's all been done\\". I like how the characters come together and relate to others they meet in this movie. It's just a sweet story. No intrigue or violence which is a nice change too. I watch it to relax. I was pleasently surprised that Jack Black's romantic lead was very good and believable. I've never seen him in a realistic (not silly or spastic) romantic role. But don't get me wrong, there is a lot of humor too. Watch it, you won't be sorry. Might be a kind of \\"chick flick\\" though, Maybe! Oh yeah, Eli Wallachs role is very loveable and fits into the plot nicely and adds a new dimension.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Alanis definitely continues with her trend of Adult Alternative. I'd prefer not to \\"enjoy\\" profanity in my music, but not only is she profane, she's profound and there's so much musically and lyrically going on here that I have a hard time downgrading it. There's a strong Indian influence here on a few tracks. Ms. Morisette's sound never gets trampled by this influence but it makes a clear impression. One track seemingly blends digital audio effects popularized by the Matrix, and an Indian hip-hop beat... This album is infectious, powerful, thoughtful, raucous, light-hearted, and lambasting. It's a wild ride, and one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is one of the best and truest comic book to movie adaptations ever. Robert Downey is absolutely perfect as Tony Stark, and the supporting cast was all on the money as well.  Technically though, if you are looking to showcase your hi-def equipment, either Iron Man or The Dark Knight is the way to go.  Crisp vivid transfers, and TrueHD audio make both of these movies tough to beat.  I have to say I enjoyed them much more in my home theatre than in the movie theatre.  With the recent price breaks in Blu-Ray equipment AND movies, there is no better time to buy.  BUY THIS MOVIE~You won't regret it!  Zorro710
B001EN71DG|5.0|Very satisfied. I've always liked Star Wars and it on VHS. I thougt it was time to upgrade to DVD so that I may enjoy it whenever.  Thanks, Kimberly Whorton
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I find it hard to rate Game of Thrones because there are elements of it that I love and elements that I don't. There are two separate plots going on and if they had just left the second one out, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. Having said that, I can't get the first plot out of my head.<br /><br />Things I love:<br />- It is hard to describe a fantasy world with satisfaction and still leave room for story. I believe GRRM has struck the prefect balance (for me) between showing us a world and \\"getting on with it\\". Compare with say, Worm Ouroboros, in which I felt the story suffered for all the description going on.<br /><br />- No one is perfect. Just like real life, everyone has failings. The good guys try to avoid them and/or make up for when they mess up.<br /><br />- Memorable Characters. For all the characters in this book, they are nearly all distinct and have their own issues/motivations. This more than anything else will drive me to read on in the series.<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />- This story is in a fantasy world, but the \\"fantasy\\" elements are only hinted at. I can see some frustrated readers out there waiting and waiting for these thing to come up, but they never do. As I found out, knowing this going in will make all the difference.<br /><br />- The level of grittyness: My biggest complaint, and why I stopped reading at one point. Many times in the book I find myself saying \\"no, no, I really didn't need to know that -- much.\\" Again I'll point out that this is mainly from that second plot. (There is another novel by GRRM that has been described as toned down. I am most definitely going to get that one.)<br /><br />- Some 2 dimensional characters still exist in this book, and GRRM tries to make them more, which is worse. There is plenty of others to enjoy however.
B00003CX9W|3.0|When I received this order, it was scratched and would not play.  Returned for a refund with no problem , but I had to pay return postage.
B00153ZRHM|2.0|Unfortunately this blu ray DVD comes up in a foreign language. You have to be certain to select English each time. Not the most convenient.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I wanted to love this movie but it was just missing...something.  It did not help that the lead actor(Tristan Thorn), for me, just didn't cut it.  The rest of the cast was amazing and really pulled me in...but everytime his character was solo on screen...I would start to lose attention.<br />All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie but I borrowed it from a friend and it will not be one I purchase to watch over and over.  Good plot, creative and flamboyant sets, and Claire Danes is spectacular.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|VAMPIRE WEEKEND<br />Self-Titled, XL Recordings.<br /><br />(AKA: the summer record that I'm so NOT OK with you NOT owning!)<br /><br />You don't have to be a hipster to fall in love with Vampire Weekend. They can make you happy, too!<br /><br />I first heard about them a few months back when they were on Saturday Night Live. I was like \\"Who?\\" then I expected a hardcore something-or-other. I was ready to flip the channel over to MadTV.<br /><br />Instead, I almost go out of bed and started dancing.<br /><br />The name is deceiving- no black eye-make-up, no gothic drudgery. The music is more like a redux of Paul Simon's poppy stuff, add in a hint of Bob Marley.<br /><br />The lyrics seem to have much significance to the writers, but not to us. Usually this style of writing bothers me, but somehow they make it work. It is like a peek into someone's personal diary that they wrote on a Manhattan cross-town bus.<br /><br />For the faint of ear, there is a bit of harsh language, but it isn't all over the record. There is very little spiritual significance or words of eternal worth. But there are good feelings. It is a silly fun happy record that aches and oozes of summertime in New York City. It deserves to be played at every barbecue and picnic.<br /><br />Recommendation: Buy the record. Besides the artistic obligation to the independents, it is extremely listenable the whole way through. If you want to sample one track, try downloading \\"M79\\".<br /><br />CAUTION: be careful listening to the record while shopping, or you may find yourself in Urban Outfitters getting properly outfitted with some new chucks and Levi supper-skinny jeans! (And asking the clerk \\"Do you carry Madras?\\")
B0018SWA56|4.0|I really didn't want to read this book because after reading Something Borrowed I really hated Darcy.  The only reason that I decided to give it a chance was because I wanted to see who Darcy ended up with.  At the beginning of the book I was almost tempted to give up since it started right where Something Borrowed left off.  Rachel had Dex and Darcy was still blaming everyone for all her troubles.  She couldn't believe that her best friend stole her fiance even though she cheated on her fiance with one of his college buddies.  To top it all of she gets preggers.  So there she is feeling sorry for herself with no where to go.  She decides to crash at her best friend Ethan's London pad.  I was hoping that when Darcy got to London, her personality would do a 360 but as in real life it took almost the entire book for Darcy to turn herself around and be the person that she truly was meant to be.  The author did a great job of showing how hard it is to change something so ingrained as your character but she did it gradually and so beautifuly that I am hoping she will follow up with a sequel about Darcy.  I ended up rooting for her and Ethan even more so than Rachel and Dex.  I would suggest that you read Something Borrowed first before you read the sequel.  It will be much more enjoyable.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|OK, so Tracy hasn't written like this in YEARS, if EVER.<br /><br />the songs are mature, catchy, and DIFFERENT!<br /><br />she questions, she years, she praises and she sings loud and proud.<br /><br />the first 3 tracks are my favorite, and the whole record is the most listenable full on record from her since her first one!
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|The Good: the water was pretty.<br />The Bad: the storyline, the songs, the singing, the acting<br />The Ugly: the directing and editing.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--I love musicals, I'm a child of the 70's and a teen of the 80's so I grew up with ABBA (although I don't care for most of their music) and I adore almost every actor in this movie, especially Colin Firth. However, I put the blame for this terrible movie square on the shoulders of the director and editor. I read a review that said Mamma Mia looked like a rough cut, and I have to agree. Musicals inherently call for a suspension of belief--who spontaneously bursts into song in real life?--so the execution of the songs and choreography needs to be flawless. Not the case in this movie. And poor Pierce Brosnan! I give him props for stepping outside the acting box but he looked downright pained anytime he had to sing. Nothing in this movie was crisp or tight, and the ending was just flat. Dancing Queen is arguably ABBA's biggest hit and instead of using it as a finale in the story its stuck in the middle. I don't count the irritating rendition at the end. And don't get me started on the cheeze-tastic performance of Waterloo.<br /><br />I was HIGHLY disappointed in this movie. I think it had much more potential and could have been a really great musical.
B001DHXT20|4.0|We saw \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" on Father's day. My son has this costume and has pretended to be the Hulk for like four Halloween's in a row. This was the perfect Father's Day movie for us.<br /><br />It was entertaining, for the first 2/3 was actually quite great. It pays a fun homage to the original television series in numerous aspects, which made me happy. The chase scenes were fun and unpredictable. Edward Norton was seriously great, and he seemed to really capture Bruce Banner on camera like nobody ever has. He hurt, he laughed; he was a human with a terrible secret. On screen he really convinced me how confused lost he was. After returning back to himself he grappled basic human needs; he was begging for money homeless at one point. I believed it.<br /><br />Then the character `Abomination' comes into it, and, again, my ADD kicks in to overdrive as it did with The Happening.<br /><br />Big movies always seem to be about disasters and heroes. We seem to constantly be reaching for images of something bigger than ourselves. We to want shaken, we seem to crave it.<br /><br />Over all they are standard summer movies, but for a thoroughly good time I'd suggest \\"Iron Man\\" over either of them. In my book, it sets a whole new precedence for superhero movies, though more is to be told with the upcoming Dark Knight...
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I bought this movie after watching it over and over on Netflix. I realized that, if I was watching it that many times, and I wanted to skip certain scenes, that I might as well just get the DVD and make it easier on myself! I bought it, and was even more excited once I saw the special features!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This was the best CD I ever purchased. After watching the movie and absolutely being blown away by the cast from a great Meryl Streep, with her surprising and excellent voice, to Agent 007--Pierce Brosnan, who cannot sing a lick but was willing to \\"go out on a limb\\" like that and still pulled it off, I could not wait to purchase the CD and relive the movie and ABBA everyday. It fills my house with fun and joy.
B001TH16DI|1.0|This sucks, the movies I would give 5 stars, but come on, this is blu-ray it should be so much better, I would like to see a complete Blu-ray Collection of all 10 films, all fully restored, all with the original theatrical release, the extended cut, and the directors cut ext.......    Blade Runner got it right, what an epic Blu-ray Collection. Something like that would be great.     but for now, I am waiting........just waiting
B000005DQR|4.0|4 1/2     It's always sad when an awesomely promising artist breaks through on a debut that pushes any given genre forward and then simply walks away from that identity. That is what seemingly happened with former electronic mastermind Shadow, emerging from, with this profoundly consistent (minus a penchant for old-school, hip-hop inflected interludes) fusion of (some of the most) brilliant samples, creative beats, and smooth, visionary production where a subtle attention to detail belies surface simplicity. Yes, he made some decent cuts on a few other albums, but nothing near the wholehearted commitment to electro-evolution like this.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Unfortunately the dvd i purchased was not was what I was expecting. It was not the original casing. When I informed the seller, they were VERY convenient and allowed the return. It was a great transaction despite my item not being satisfactory. Very accomodating!
B00000255F|3.0|3 1/2<br /><br />Nearly as big and bold sounding as the distinguished pedigree would suggest, yet in all its rugged glory, somehow falls short of intended power for me, as Springsteen howls through a few brilliantly transcending, but some musically similar ideas in an overall semi-contrived, but potently rawer approach.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|got this in a very short time and it was delivered as promised...i bought a used copy
B001GH63IE|3.0|I decided to purchase this after hearing \\"La Puerta Del Cielo,\\" that song featuring such a unique and haunting vocalist.    There is some \\"good\\" in this album, but it seems on the whole that it's really lacking. Almost like, there are a few bright spots among several songs that don't do anything for me. It seems more of a musical experiment than a moving work of art...which, according to Michael himself in a recent interview I saw, is exactly what he was doing. He's experimenting and trying to follow his sense of testing new ideas.      I love the more meaningful songs such as Sadeness, Age of Loneliness, Prism of Life, Shadows in Silence, Eyes of Truth, etc. A feature of most of those songs is the use of vocals which are sincere and true to their origin. A native american, a mongolian throat singer, etc. You can hear them in their personal element and they really add to the music, so much so that they are what drew me to Enigma in the first place.    This album only features one such song (La Puerta Del Cielo) and yet even that seems repetitive and stuck after a while.    It almost feels like Michael has some true gems among his music but also has a lot of \\"forced\\" or shallow stuff as well that gets in the way a lot.
0596007124|5.0|Great introductory book on design patterns - curious style of writing but it seems to work for me.  Highly recommended
B001TLZRZW|5.0|Considering how many times I've listened to this album by this point, I think it's about time I put my two cents in on how it sounds.    First off, from anyone other than Lamb of God, this is a friggin' amazing album.  Second, from Lamb of God, this is a friggin' amazing album.  Honestly, I never thought they'd beat Ashes of the Wake, and although I'm still not sure if they have, I think this is at least pretty close.    Pros-  I must say, I love having the extra acoustic breaks in here.  Sacrament, while an excellent album, was completely devoid of acoustic playing, even the (seemingly-traditional) acoustic intro to the last song.  Wrath, however, kicks off with a beautiful acoustic buildup that launches perfectly into the first full song.  Personally, I'd have to say that the In Your Words is the closest this album gets to filler, and it's pretty far from it.  (A great improvement over Sacrament, about a third of which I think sounded like filler.)  The guitar playing is a little more technical than it's been in a while--the chorus riffs of Fake Messiah and Choke Sermon are probably the best examples of this, and also a couple of the best riffs on the album.  In terms of album progression, this one is very well put together--from the acoustic intro, we launch into four hard-rocking songs, pull back from the pretty intense end of Fake Messiah for about the first thirty seconds of Grace, and blast right back in again.  Reclamation finishes off the album with the classic acoustic break intro, and includes a nice desolate, de-tuned outro as well, leaving you with the intended sense of how much we've screwed up.  Production isn't quite as clean-cut and crisp as Sacrament, but I think that's a good thing--this music is a little more raw, perhaps, and not smoothing that over leaves its full impact there.    Cons-  Really, the only one of these I can think of is that the lyric-writing isn't as great as it used to be.  The songs are really fun to listen to, but for the most part, don't seem to mean that much.  Ashes of the Wake is the winner for that one.    Overall-  Basically, if you've enjoyed anything Lamb of God has ever put out, you enjoy everything they've done, and this album will not disappoint.  Not a revolution, but it doesn't need to be--just a little more rocking than they've been for a while.  This one's a keeper.

B001N26GFM|4.0|I watched this film with my two young adult daughters and all of us spent some time together afterwards discussing the film from our own perspectives. Their paternal grandparents lived in Germany during WWII and in visiting them over the years we have had the opportunity to visit several of the remains of concentration camps and it has been a life changing experience for all of us. This movie, while a heartbreaking but necessary lesson on many levels, did have one flaw that all of us picked up on right away. We knew it was an English picture but the choice of actors, especially for the boy and his mother who had pronounced English accents, really threw us off the beginning of the film. To present this film as being a German story to us fell short with the young boy calling his mother \\"Mum\\" with true British style instead of the German version which would be \\"Mutti\\". The sister and the father and grandfather all seemed to be \\"German\\" as they did not have the English accents so it was a bit of a disappointment and therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of the 5 it should have received.  A real German officer would not have gotten this type of job with a British wife or British sounding children and that was totally confusing to us all.

So, if you are thinking of getting into brewing or already have brewed and want to get updated, then do yourself a favor and buy this book!
B000FS9FCG|2.0|I was stuck somewhere when this movie came on and ended up watching parts of it.  If your idea of a hero is someone filled with hatred, bitterness, fantasies of violence and revenge, plus able to torture a poor innocent girl for her own good; then this movie is for you.  The very philosophy behind this movie is sick and twisted.  Of course, Hugo Weaving is a great actor even when he is forced to act from behind a Guy Fawkes mask (I think that's what it was), and Natalie Portman is good, but it's not her best role.  I don't care for movies with agendas and this one clearly has an axe to grind.  I want to be entertained--this was NOT entertaining.  It was depressing.
B000025JU0|4.0|Synthesizers got cheap in the late '70s.  Go do something interesting with them.  You don't have to show off like Maestro Rick Wakemen.  You don't have to create ponderous Space Rock like Tangerine Dream.  You can make a record like nobody's ever heard before.  That's what OMD did on \\"Junk Culture.\\"  Processed horn sections, electronically filtered vocals, quirky percussive efects all never sounded so magnificent....and to think this was just a light pop music record.  Critics?  What did they know?  They were too busy drooling over Van Halen's latest back then.  OMD was not music for rock music critics; a primitive life form that could not possibly grasp an electroacoustic journey like \\"Junk Culture\\"!

B000WGWQG8|4.0|About 3 months before watching this mini-series I completed Page Smith's 1200 page bio of Adams, so the impressions left by that magisterial work were still in my mind.     I understand when moving from page to film much has to be left out and parts you enjoyed in the book will be missed from the movie.  (For example I would have loved to seen the journey Adams and Quincy made through Spain on their trip to France.)    However, there was one central theme of the movie that involved both a distortion of the history and the person of John Adams. This alteration was the type of father Adams was particularly with his relation to his son Charles.  The film version made it appear that Charles was rebellious as a young child and that rebellion was in large part due to his father's long absences from the family.  This picture is wrong in two ways.  First, Charles showed no such rebellion.  In fact he was usually everyone's favorite: the handsomest, sweetest, brightest, happiest, most talented member of the family and virtually everybody who met him loved him.    Second, Adams was not away from his family nearly as much as the film indicated.  (and I would add when he did go Abigail pushed him out the door) The homecoming where he does not recognize his children is a complete fabrication; it never happened.  All (except maybe Thomas) of his children were with him in France or England at one time or another and his mind was always burdened with their moral, spiritual and mental development, constantly writing letters encouraging them to be good Christians, citizens and Americans.  Page's description of these letters to his children is very touching and made me feel shame for my comparable lack of concern for my own children.    It would have been very easy to portray Adams' fatherhood in a proper light and it would have made it a much better movie.  Adams had many faults and if the producers of the bio wanted to bring him down to earth by showing his weaknesses they did not have to invent one like they did in the distortion of his fatherhood.    There were a few things about the move that I really enjoyed.  First was his correspondence with Jefferson at the end of his life. This was done very well and the way it was tied to Abigail's death was masterful, at times it had me in tears.    There were also wonderful historical accuracies that were displayed which could be appreciated by those familiar with the events surrounding John Adams life.  First of all was the use of light.  Most modern movies that depict the time before light bulbs show all rooms being flooded with light day or night.  In this movie they light was used more realistically.  At night the rooms are dark with faces hardly visible and even during the day when Adams reads in a room he always leans toward a window to be assisted by the rays of the sun.      Another quality that I enjoyed (and this may sound strange) was how they portrayed the characters physical appearance, particularly their skin.  If one studies the history of hygiene it is clear that our forefathers did not place a great importance on bathing which evidenced itself with bad skin.  This movie did wonderfully by showing the characters' spots, acne, blackheads, warts, and all other types of dermatological blemishes.  Abigail always had a mild case of acne on her cheeks and forehead; the French had warts zits and pimples for all to see despite having pasted their faces white; as John's hairline recedes it reveals a head full of warts and boils and in one scene John Quincy is giving a report to his father after returning from France and he has two large blackheads on the side of his chin.  This may sound repugnant, but it was a refreshing change from the picture perfect images that are usually given the actors in most Hollywood movies.    There were also little historical tidbits that the writers of the scripts included that I found delightful. For example when Jefferson resumed his correspondence with Adamshe was working on the architecture for University of Virginia.  This is shown when, in order to make space to write Adam's first letter, he clears from his desk a pile of architectural diagrams.  As he to write Jefferson pulls out a writing duplication machine that he was particularly fond of.    One more comment.  When I first heard of this mini-series I put off watching it because  of Paul Giamatti playing John Adams.  After watching him in Sideways and Big Fat Liar I did not think he could properly portray John Adams..  Not that his role in these movies was bad it was  just so incompatible with the type of person John Adams was that I did not believe he could properly act the part.  I was wrong.  Mr. Giamatti was amazing.    All in all this series had very good entertainment value, it was enjoyable and despite the limited historical revisionism was very informative. Parents beware: there are two scenes of brief frontal nudity in the first and second to the last CDs.  The first in a lynching and the second is Nabby's breast surgery.  The scenes are by not means sexually tantalizing, but they are there and will offed some.
B000PY30JE|5.0|Absolute perfection. Although I love Chet's vocals on other albums, the pure sound of his horn will more than suffice anytime, but especially on this disc. \\"It Never Entered My Mind\\" can bring me to tears. The one downer is a now old and sour producer Orin Keepnews's bitter bitchy updated liner notes. What a pill! I highly recommend this album, Keepnews's crankiness not withstanding.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|This has to be one of the worst lines in the movie . This turky remake of the 1930s classic is shameful. The Women (remake) boast's an overacting cast with zero chemistry.  What's next Jessica Simpson as Scarlett O'Hara?<br /><br />Save yourself from writting a negative review  to warn others and avoid this turkey. This should sweep the Razzies....
0440241901|5.0|I laughed from start to finish.  The characters were great and definitely someone I can relate to.  Read it in one day because it became so addicting after the first chapter.  Recommended for a light reader who wants a good laugh.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Live Aid has always been a sentimental favorite of mine, in part because I grew up in the Philadelphia area, when concerts at the now-demolished JFK stadium were legend.  The spectacle of somewhere around 100,000 people at the stadium for this event is quite awesome.  I missed the event when it aired, and aside from a few individual songs I saw on the internet, I never got to experience that day of July 13, 1985.  Now with this DVD, I finally got my chance.    If you read the DVD insert (some obviously haven't), it's a wonder it ever made it to release.  Much of the footage was damaged or lost.  It's remarkable that the DVD is as good as it is, considering the age and other circumstances.    The music at the concert was a real unique snapshot in time - many of those acts are gone, while others are so much older now.  Where else could you see newly ascending greats like U2 or Madonna at the same event with with legends like Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Phil Collins, The Who and so many others?  Some were there and gone in a flash, such as George Michael and Duran Duran.    As noted by others, the absence of Led Zepellin is conspicuous, but it's their choice.  They felt their performance was sub standard - and it was.  I've seen it on YouTube.  If it were me, I'd a left it in for the sake of history, but I can't say I blame them.    The effort to save lives in Africa from the proceeds was admirable, and save lives they did.  But the larger problems of greed, poverity, famine and corruption are still here with us.    Live Aid can stand on its own musically, aside from the cause.  It's a great, once in a lifetime, never to be repeated experience.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I bought the Sonic Super Ear for my husband, who listens to the T.V. so loud that it gives me a headache and send the pets running!  He said that he was able to hear every word of the movie we watched last night, and I had the movie at a volume set for me.  The down side is that when I would talk to him, he'd wince and tell me 'not so loud'!  It does amplify EVERYTHING.  And then there are the wires to deal with....<br /><br />He said he thinks it's great, all in all we're happy to have it.
0061148512|2.0|I read this book in highschool and it nearly ruined modern fiction for me. I'm older now, have a masters degree in English, and I still find this book a boring, uninteresting, waste of time. To me Plath tries too hard to come across broken and tragic in her writing. Why do so many people think that a character's descent into madness makes for good reading? Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone is equally a waste of time in this regard.
B00067BBQE|5.0|This dvd concert is awesome! The songs and band are full of energy, and the audio is great!

B001IA46D8|5.0|Unlike others who complain about too much Mark Owen's voice on the album, I really enjoyed his songs. I can't imagine Gary Barlow singing those songs (Up all Night, Hello).  I love this album more than The Beautiful World album which is also great! All the songs are catchy but my favourites are The Garden (being the best song on this album), Hello, How Did We Come To This, Up All Night, What Is Love, Said It All and the bonus track She Said which is so beautiful it makes you wanna dance all the time.   Take That never fails to surprise me with their good catchy songs and The Circus is not the exception. All four of them did a great job and they deserve five stars from me without any hasitation.

B001LQCID4|5.0|Set in the future, Metropolis is a silent-film that showcases the time transcending theme of the social inequalities between the rich and the poor, between workers and the owners in capitalism.  Even in 1926 when the book was written by Lang's wife Thea von Harbou, were these issues that still exist today very prevalent to people.<br /><br />German born director Fritz Lang is considered by many as being the greatest director of all time.  As far as German Expressionism is concerned, Fritz Lang may not be the father of it, but he definately raised it like his own and Metropolis is probably the most prolific example of this.
0553801546|2.0|This book is enjoyable enough on it's own, and I think fans will enjoy most of the story. The ending, however, is a bit hard to swallow.    My main problem is that the author ignored 5+ books worth of character development just to make an attempt at closure and end the series.    *** SPOILERS ***    You could see where the author was originally going to take the story when Kettricken asked Fitz to take the initiative and give Chade orders directly. All three - Fitz, Kett, Chade - saw this as him taking his rightful place as Sacrifice (becoming the shadow king of the Duchies), at least until Dutiful came of age. Yet as soon as Molly showed up, Fitz the King was COMPLETELY forgotten as if it had been some minor development.    Fitz's decision to return to Molly and become a farmer was really out of sync with what had happened in the story up to that point. The entire 6-book story had led up to Fitz taking his place as a Farseer King, with Kettricken as his Queen (in all ways). The relationship between Kettricken and Fitz had been steadily building up, through both clear signs of attraction and masterfully implied sexual tension, yet was just shrugged off in the end.    Fitz saw the lovemaking between Verity/Kettricken in Royal Assassin, but instead of asking Verity to stop Skill-sharing, he went so far as to make love to Molly at the same time and came away remembering only blond hair and soft white skin (an image so important to him that he journals about it in his cabin years later). He became her closest friend, confidante and adviser. Nighteyes himself warned Fitz that his thoughts on her were not appropriate, pointing out that she already had a mate. Fitz may confuse his thoughts with Verity's, but Nighteyes would not make that comment unless it was what Fitz himself was feeling.    Which is another important link. Nighteyes shared a bond with both Fitz and Kettricken. That's no small detail. She even felt him die, despite being hundreds of miles away.    He wrapped both his Wit and arms around her nearly every time they were in a room together. When he was seriously injured, she personally sat at his bedside in her nightgown nursing him back to health. She even told him outright that were she not already married, there would have been something between them. There was also abundant and excessive kissing, among many other things, but I think I've made my point.    Fitz had decided that the \\"quiet life\\" had just isolated him from the people he cared about, and that he would not do it again. He went so far as to hold his father's sword and proclaim that he would leave his mark as King. What, his mark was to immediately retreat to the countryside to pick berries and mend horseshoes?    His relationship with Molly was very clearly revealed as just a \\"love of youth and a simpler time,\\" not true love. Kettle, with her hundreds of years of maturity, pointed out (and Fitz agreed) that they fought at least as often as they played nice. Really, whenever they weren't in bed together, they did nothing BUT fight.    Think about how it could have ended: intrigue and power struggles with Chade as King Fitz's adviser; a romance with Kettricken that could not be revealed; two children he had to pretend were not his yet see every single day and open his mind to during Skill lessons; continuing the overriding story arch by giving his life to the throne with few knowing what he sacrificed; wondering when the Fool would return. These are the sort of things that we love about Fitz and what make him who he is. And he had finally accepted that life.    Instead, we have poor Kettricken knowing love for only ONE WEEK of her entire life, Dutiful making babies with a 14-year old girl and being a King at 15 (though no one thought he was mature enough), Burrich killed off just to free up Molly, the Fool permanently disappearing, and Fitz deciding that he really didn't care about anyone (Chade/Kettricken/Dutiful/Thick/the people of Buckkeep/the Six Duchies/Web/Hap/Starling/etc.) but Molly, and crawling back to her.    After all of his realizations and hard-earned maturity, there is no excuse for tossing Fitz off in the countryside where he does nothing at all and is isolated from all but one person he loves... and saying he's happy with it.    Hobb unfortunately wanted some sort of concrete ending, and moving Fitz away from what she had built up was the best way to do that, even if it was a life he clearly no longer wanted. It's a shame, because this ending still doesn't end Fitz's story completely, and - in my humble opinion - is much less satisfying than what she seemed to originally have planned.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Wow, what a great blu ray title to have, the plane crash in surround sound was like a plane crashing into my house, and the island scenes were breathtaking, highly recommended blu ray purchase, even if you have the dvd like me
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|Amazing.  The moog synthesizer is prevelent throughout the album.  Instead of being too aggressive they use it to creates a gentle background buzz which allows you to focus on the beautiful songwriting and heavenly harmonies.  Songs 2 through 6 especially  blend together into one large canvas for the artists to work their magic. I would suggest this album to anyone that likes to listen to an album from start to finish. The bonus tracks at the end add some alternate takes, moog weirdness, and a few other unreleased songs (Crosby's \\"Triad\\", for one, that should have been on the album), and the \\"secret\\" song at the end of the disc with mostly David Crosby & drummer Clarke agruing in the studio about a riff in a song is hilarious. You can hear the Byrds falling apart, but it turned out to spark McGuinn's creative fire in just the right way.  This is thelast ablum Crosby was a part of and it showed it subsequent showings.

0446401307|2.0|After a string of good (and a few truly great) Harry Bosch novels, Michael Connelly writes with the burden of high expectations from his long-time readers. In this case, the burden proves too great; what would be an acceptable effort from a lesser writer is quite disappointing. Despite a promising set-up, the plot quickly devolves into a formulaic retread of some of his prior work: Feds intrude on Bosch's investigation; [SPOILER ALERT] murder with ominous implications turns out to be much more banal (and domestic) in nature. If you have read \\"Trunk Music\\", in particular, you should pass this one up.<br /><br />As an aside, \\"The Overlook\\" first appeared in serial form, something we'll be seeing more of with the increasing power of authors to deliver content more directly to readers (and a concomitant decline in the power of publishers). This book is weak, and one wonders whether there is anything inherently inferior in modern serialized novels. Certainly, Stephen King's serialized novels haven't been his best. Is editorial input less significant in serial work, since an editor can't see the whole narrative as the work is published (unlike with completed submissions)? Then again, I doubt that Connelly's and King's editors have much input on narrative at this point, anyway. These are popular writers, and no one ever prospered arguing against popular taste.

It has to do with a boy named Bruno who moves to a new house where from his bedroom window he sees what he believes is a farm, surrounded by a fence.  His mother tells him not to go in the backyard but Bruno disobeys and explores all the way to the fence!  Where he mets another boy, and a forbidden friendship is formed!  It's really an amazing movie, very sad.  This is a must-see movie for anybody.
B00005JPY2|5.0|The story is all about time,not superheroes;that is why it is called \\"Watchmen\\". It is about the flows and ebbs of history and how the past affects the future.It is about how we are all cogs in a great wheel and if we  do not recognize this we will be crushed in the gears of time( that is what all of the clock imagery in the book was alll about).

0812971825|1.0|Rather than accompanying another in their suffering which ends in  death, the author seems to convey that the compassionate way is  to either to end another's life or give her the means to do it.  Because of this view, I threw the book in the trash rather than pass  it on.      I did think the author did a good job in portraying the foibles of  people in jumping to conclusions and, as a result, not being able  to be there for someone in the throes of grief and, at times, being  downright harmful.

1400082773|5.0|This would have been a great book even if Obama hadn't been elected President.    \\"Dreams from My Father\\" is not political.  It's the personal story of a confused and troubled youth growing up and becoming a man.  The honesty is brutal, the insights painful and joyful in turn.  This is one of those rare books that can help you become a better person.    I read the book through twice, repeatedly forgetting that it was written by the President of the United States.  I can't think of a much higher compliment.
0452289963|4.0|I bought the book which was recommended by Oprah because of my longtime interest in/and psychology studies.  It is excellent. I have been aware of living in the present as opposed to wasting our present moments living in the past or wasting our present moments thinking about the futureand that it will finally bring happiness or whatever you are looking for.  Eckhart Tolle expands upon this.  He also gives great insight into the difference between Spirit & Ego.  Tolle himself says (in the book) that some people will not understand it or are not ready for it.   This is so true ...the odd bitter critic has come out and clearly has no comprehension of it.  Opinion by someone that Oprah was trying to launch her own 'religion' also just shows extreme ignorance...and is laughable.  Read the book.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Walt Disney's PINOCCHIO is given a lavish restoration treatment in the 2-Disc Platinum Edition released in 2010. Not only does it look better than ever, but the extra features (including a great segment on \\"The Making of Pinocchio\\" and a feature on Live Action inspiration for the artists), are meticulous and informative. But, of course, the best news of all is that the frame by frame restoration brings the entire story to glowing life in a way that is absolutely amazing for a film that is seventy years old.<br /><br />It's a famous morality tale from the pen of an Italian writer with all of the original material fine tuned by Disney to give it a softer image. All of the ingredients of the tale are beautifully realized by the Disney artists. You'll want to use the \\"pause\\" feature to gaze at the detailed and highly imaginative art work which has the kind of depth and dimension it never had before. You can really spot how artfully the Multiplane Camera was used to photograph cells and backgrounds. The village scenes and the interiors of Gepetto's woodshop have a clarity that jumps from the screen.<br /><br />It's no wonder the film has such lasting appeal. The characters come alive and make the story so much more compelling for their presence. Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish, along with Gepetto, Stromboli, The Blue Fairy--and most of all, Jiminy Cricket--all register strongly and draw you into the story from beginning to end. The voices are right on target, especially Christian Rub as Gepetto, Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket and Dickie Jones, who is ideally cast as the voice of the little puppet.<br /><br />The darker elements of the story may be disturbing for very young children so parents are advised to be aware of sequences involving the cruel puppet master Stromboli and the magnificently animated underwater scenes involving Monstro the Whale.<br /><br />The busy musical background score won an Oscar for Best Original Score and the song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" won for Best Song. These features are best represented by the film's opening scenes in Gepetto's woodshop where the various clocks come to life as the hour strikes, a charming sequence during which the art of animation reaches new heights, all with music playing an important part in plot development as Jiminy, Gepetto and Pinocchio interact after The Blue Fairy gives the wooden puppet life.<br /><br />Disney gave him life too and this gorgeously animated film should have a long shelf life as long as people watch films decade after decade.atures are best represented by the film's opening scenes in Gepetto's woodshop where the various clocks come to life as the hour strikes, a charming sequence during which the art of animation reaches new heights, all with music playing an important part in plot development as Jiminy, Gepetto and Pinocchio interact after The Blue Fairy gives the wooden puppet life.

0316017922|2.0|Outliers is a quick read and brings up points that are worth repeating (the argument for affirmative action comes to mind).  It boggles my mind, though, that Gladwell fails to pick up on gender as a possible factor.  He asks what it is that the 75 wealthiest people ever have in common, and as you peruse the list it is obvious that they're overwhelmingly men.  He goes on to list the 14 Americans from the 19th century from the list, and refers to them as men and women, but there are no actual women on the list.  He asks whether a 5'6\\" person could play pro basketball, and I started to think, well, that's pretty tall . . . but Gladwell says this person wouldn't have a chance.  Well, that's true, assuming we're limiting our discussion to males.  He mentions some female child geniuses, I wonder what happens to them!  I'm really not going out of my way to be a feminist here, it's just that in a book about success, it sure would be nice to know where I (and the other 51% of us) could figure in!  Arrrgh!    Nice that those successful men had good mothers.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|\\"Let the Right One In\\" is among the most striking vampire films I've seen. It is less a horror film than a drama with a horrific premise that jumps out at the audience every once in while. The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a screenplay written by John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of the novel on which it is based. In a working class suburb of Stockholm in the early 1980s, a frail, bookish 12-year-old named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is terrorized by bullies at his school, while a murderer who drains his victims' blood stalks the community. Oskar is miserable, without friends or any obvious self-esteem. One evening, he is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl who recently moved into his building. Eli is as socially isolated as Oskar is, but she could be a dangerous friend to have.<br /><br />The violence that lies beneath the nearly silent, snow-covered exterior is the scary part. It's cold. The population seems affable but disaffected. The efforts of Eli's keeper (Per Ragnar) to procure blood for her are so mundane and matter-of-fact that their violence is all the more startling. Yet I almost pitied him his difficulties. Oskar's mounting anger threatens to explode. Eli is a haunting girl with dark hair and big, blue eyes, possessed of a calm resignation and no aversion to killing. The film achieves its creepiness through a measured pace, quiet setting, and a refusal to spell anything out for us. We're never certain what's going to happen or even what we want to happen. We come to understand Eli's predicament slowly. In the end, I wasn't sure what I thought of her, but Eli made a strong impression. In Swedish with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, a Photo Gallery of 20 production stills, a Theatrical Poster Gallery of 5 posters, and a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" (7 1/2 min) featurette in which director Tomas Alfredson talks about the movie, casting, and characters.

B001UF33TE|4.0|There is no question about Rod Stewart this past year. He has celebrated a joyous moment of his life, 40 years of great music and proving that his voice will always be sexy, and that is what he still wants us to think. That has been said with the recent re-issuing for his 2008 Definitive Rod Stewart collection last year. But as that may be just the only collection worth celebrating, It has been more than 15 years since Rod Stewart wowed the audience with his critically acclaimed and down to Earth performance on MTV's Unplugged, and honestly it still remains the best from the classic days of MTV. Now, it has been re-released and a new crowd is definitely wanting to find a new reason to believe in Rod again.<br /><br />The 2009 re-release of Rod Stewart's acclaimed Unplugged and Seated expands the already classic live album to a new generation of fans, who may just have thought of Rod as just a moonlight crooner from the past several years, largely from his Great American Songbook Series. Ths songs here bring in a somber and elequent stripped down of Rod's classic songs from his 1993 live performance on MTV so well, and the songs have all been remastered nicely. The collection includes all of the great live tracks from before including his hits Reason To Believe, his cover of Van Morrison's Have I Told You Lately, Having A Party, and his classic performance of The Faces, Stay With Me. The album also expands nicely by adding a few tracks that were overlooked from the original album including a acoustic somber version of Forever Young and Gasoline Alley.<br /><br />All in all, if you've never experienced hearing Rod Stewart's Unplugged and Seated, than you'll definitely want that chance right now. This is a really great live album, and it is so great to see it finally available as a must buy for MP3 library. No doubt about this one as a true reason to believe in Rod Stewart again.<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Note: The review that follows is of the 70th Anniversary edition that includes Blu-ray and DVD discs.<br /><br />I first saw Pinocchio soon after it appeared on movie screens in 1939 and have since seen it more than a dozen times.  Based on Carlo Collodi's children's classic, it remains my favorite Disney animated feature, the first to be released as a DVD and is now available in both Blu-ray and High Definition, also for the first time. It has never looked better. The two-disc Platinum 70th Anniversary Edition supplements the 88-minute film with a wealth of bonus features that include never-before-seen deleted scenes, a never-before-seen alternative ending, the \\"Pinocchio Knows Trivia Challenge,\\" \\"Pleasure Island Carnival Games,\\" the \\"No Strings Attached\\" featurette on making the film, and an audio commentary by Leonard Maltin (film critic and historian), Eric Goldberg (Disney animator and director), and J.B. Kaufman (film historian and author). These bonus features are indeed special.<br /><br />As is also true of so many later Disney animated features (notably Dumbo in 1941, Bambi in 1942, Peter Pan in 1953, and Beauty and the Beast in 1991), the film Pinocchio examines several themes that include a child's or children's separation from loved ones, efforts to reunite them, serious (sometimes life-threatening) dangers to be overcome, lessons learned from all the struggles, and of course the happy ending. Of course, children's reactions to Pinocchio will vary depending upon age. (My ten grandchildren range in aqe from two to 17.) Younger ones may become upset by certain scenes, as when the little boys on Pleasure Island become donkeys, but \\"children of all ages\\" - including parents and grandparents - will thoroughly enjoy the musical score as well as Jiminy Cricket whose voice is provided by Cliff Edwards. This is one of Disney's loveliest and most charming films. In a survey conducted by the American Film Institute in 2008, Pinocchio was ranked #2 among the ten greatest animated features. (Note: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was #1, then Pinocchio, followed by Bambi, The Lion King, Fantasia, Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, Shrek, Cinderella, and Finding Nemo.) It will be interesting to see how the rankings change in years to come as other excellent animated features (e.g. Ratatouille, Wall-E, and Bolt) begin to attract more attention and appreciation.<br /><br />I look forward to watching Pinocchio for many more years to come, hopefully with great grandchildren and their parents as well as friends.  My guess is that, however technologically advanced our society has become by then, the magic dust of Disney's animated film classics will continue to be as potent as ever.ed features. (Note: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was #1, then Pinocchio, followed by Bambi, The Lion King, Fantasia, Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, Shrek, Cinderella, and Finding Nemo.)

I look forward to watching Pinocchio for many more years to come, hopefully with great grandchildren and their parents as well as friends.  My guess is that, however technologically advanced our society has become by then, the magic dust of Disney's animated film classics will continue to be as potent as ever.
B001KKRD6I|4.0|This album won't be for everyone, but if you have an ear for this type of music, the energy in it will leave you stunned. Listen to a sample on this site before buying. After repeated listenings, it just gets better & better. I cannot describe the style, or sound. It's just powerful. Great Album.
0765350386|5.0|I'm a big fan of the late Robert Jordan, and I recently picked up Sanderson's works because I heard he was writing the last book of Jordan's series, and wanted to get a feel for him - to \\"see if he could do it.\\"  But whether I think he can satisfactorily write the last book in Jordan's series is unimportant.  What matters is: I'm just glad I discovered him in the first place.    Two big things I loved which other reviewers have not touched on:    1.) Unlike many \\"adult\\" fantasy series, this book is absent of out-of-place coarseness and vulgarity.  I don't say this because I'm prude.  It would always floor me, when reading other fantasy series, when characters would belt out the same extremely vulgar swears we use in modern-day life.  It's distracting and rips you out of whatever immersion the story had built up, and is sheer laziness on the author's part.  You've created this entirely new world, why not throw in some entirely new swears to help build the world and keep the reader immersed?      2.) The magic system.  Ok, I know other reviewers have already talked about how awesome it is, but...it is really, REALLY awesome.  At first, when I learned they \\"burned metals\\", I thought it seemed ridiculously random.  Burn metals?  Why not chew plastic?  Or lick dirt?  But the more I read, the more incredible it became.  It even reverted me back to a little kid's mentality, as I pictured what it would be like to use those powers in my everyday life.  Driving home in the falling snow - \\"Now I would burn Tin.\\"  Can't get the door open - \\"Time to flare Pewter.\\"  It's an incredibly fun system of magic, I can't get enough of it.    Now, as other reviewers have said...Kelsier and Vin are extremely well-done characters, the others...not so much.  But that's because they're not really the focus of the book - and they don't *have* to be.  The world itself is so intriguing, with the class differences, the falling ash and red sky, the Lord Ruler and the thousand years of destroyed history and oppression...you don't really care that we don't know *exactly* what drives someone like Breeze or Spook or Clubs.  We know their personality and their place in the group, and that's enough.    This was an extremely satisfying, enjoyable read, and I can't wait to get the next book.
0553103547|5.0|This book, the whole series really, blew me away. I could go into detail but it all boils down to this - GET THIS BOOK! You will not be disappointed.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I don't care what anyone says, this is a good Metallica album. It's most definately a big improvement from St. Anger. \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is my favorite song on this one. Although Ride the Lightning is my favorite, Death Magnetic is one of the better Metallica albums.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" is such an excellent production, and the music really reflects it. It reminds us that not everything is as it appears, and that kindness heals us all. Even though LFBaum has long passed, this musical filled in alot of gaps that \\"Wizard of Oz\\" left us with when we saw it as children.  Isn't it funny how we've been taught to be afraid of some of the best things in life?  And the music reminds us how precious friendships really are...
B001NY42KQ|1.0|The DVD was as advertised.  The separate platter that is meant for use on a computer is also included.  Unfortunately I became frustrated because I could not make it work.  The women in my house were very disappointed.  Disney's drive to combat piracy has made using their products impossible.  I am not new to computers but I was never able to use this platter.  Product support does not exist in any way that can help.  Apparently no actual people work in product support.  I will not be buying Disney products that say \\"extended edition\\"  They are a waste of time.  They don't work period.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|there is nothing great about this album, until it ends. if you can make it that far! and for those of you that did, thats great! cuz i got about the first few songs, and tried and tried to listen to it, but my ears were SCREAMING to me, shut it off, turn it off! they were in pain. trust me i love new things and bands that true new things, like chino, triing team sleap, or singing with maynerd on passanger, or rapping with b real. when chris hung out with layne and the boys from CHAINS and sang a few songs. and, i love rap music, and rock i also listen to metal, but this, bottom line, is just bad, wrong, and very painfull. if you want chris cornell, look up soundgarden, audioslave, chris cornell, pearl jam, or alice in chains. if u look up SCREAM, look for a rock version, other then that it is painfull!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1415718113|5.0|Audrey Hepburn had a lot of memorable, glamorous roles as highly individual, sensitive young women.<br /><br />But her most iconic turn was as Holly Golightly, a frivolous young woman with a highly sensitive core. Hepburn is a ball of shimmering charm here, whether she's setting hats on fire or chasing nameless cats through the rain, and she's able to shine brightly enough to obscure a few flaws (such as Mickey Rooney). The other actors do serviceable jobs, but she's undeniablythe star.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men for their fifty-dollartips, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico with her brother. When kept-man Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.<br /><br />But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry a spectacularly wealthy man, parties with wild crowds, visits a notorious gangster in jail, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride to a hick doctor. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.<br /><br />Reportedly Truman Capote wasn't happy with the movie version of \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" -- they changed the ending from his short story's, and he didn't like Hepburn as Holly Golightley. But this is one case where the movie's quality is not reflected by what the author thought of it -- taken on its own merits, it's a fine chocolate with a bittersweet center.<br /><br />Much of the movie is devoted to the friendship (and unspoken attraction) between Holly and Paul, and how it disrupts their comfortable shallow lives. Paul spends the whole movie unravelling the unhappy tale of Holly's life as she starts spinning out of control. Things climax nastily with Holly's already-questionable reputation being sullied, but the finale is an exquisite mix of brutal honesty, true love and a very unglamorous rainstorm.<br /><br />That said, it's a pretty hilarious movie -- witty dialogue (\\"... if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking men with passionate natures and too many teeth\\") and plenty of kooky humour (\\"TIMBER!\\" Holly yells as a drunken model keels over, followed by the crowd parting like the Red Sea). And there are plenty of charming, warm'n'fuzzy moments, like the cute day trip through New York.<br /><br />One thing that will make viewers cringe: Mickey Rooney's caricatured Japanese landlord who objects to Holly's parties. Not. Funny.<br /><br />Though she was no party girl, Audrey Hepburn is pitch-perfect as Holly -- she can be flaky and adorable (\\"I'm CRAAAZY about Tiffany's?\\"), chattery and glamorous, with a cat she refuses to name because they're just a pair of \\"poor slobs who don't belong to anybody.\\" But she can just as easily flip the switch to show the wounded, almost childlike side.<br /><br />George Peppard is just as good -- albeit less winsome -- as a writer-turned-kept-man-turned-writer-again, whose protective affection for Holly grows as the movie goes on, but who has to get through her ironclad defenses. And Patricia Neal rounds out the cast nicely as the icy, cynical woman whom Paul gives his non-literary services to.<br /><br />Hepburn is the flawed diamond at the heart of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" and her charm and acting ability elevate this beyond just another adorable romantic comedy.n exquisite mix of brutal honesty, true love and a very unglamorous rainstorm.

0143037757|5.0|Tony Judt's synopsis of European history from 1945-2005 is a masterpiece of historical research and narrative. To understand recent European history absent careful study of this book would require many years of in-depth research with numerous primary and secondary sources.  I know of no comparable work, though the brief treatise by Volker Berghahn (\\"Europe in the Era of Two World Wars:  From Militarism and Genocide to Civil Society, 1900-1950\\") is a more concise rendering of the topic.<br /><br />The ever-erudite Judt, himself a \\"public intellectual\\" of the type currently derided in \\"post-modern\\" Europe, has intimate first-hand knowledge of many of the more recent events (e.g., the Yugoslavian War) described in this book.  He also has comprehensive knowledge of apparently every other seminal event (and plenty of arcana) that has occurred in the European landmass and has incorporated his encylopedic knowledge into this complex history.<br /><br />Following a roughly chronological approach, Judt analyzes the recovery from WW-II and progression towards the current EU.  Social, historical, economic, political considerations are carefully reviewed and integrated into a genuinely compelling historical work.  Particular emphasis (and insights) are devoted to the problems of incorporating refugees (from the \\"East\\") and migrants (from Turkey and former EU colonies) into the \\"fabric\\" of European culture.<br /><br />Implicit in the history of the post-war era is, naturally the role of the various European (and \\"near-neighbor\\" nations, including the USSR and Turkey) entities in that conflict and one of its central events, the Holocaust.  The centrality of the war (in general) and this event (in particular) as it applies to recent European history is perhaps best stated in the pithy aphorism on the enduring nature of guilt, \\"post equitem sedit atra cura\\", (\\"dark care sits behind the horseman\\" or, more concretely, \\"A guilty man cannot escape himself\\").  Judt devotes many pages to demonstrating that this observation also applies to societies; not only by dealing with the matter of complicity, but also in the need to empirically accommodate post-war national myths to undeniable facts.  This took many forms, including \\"collective amnesia\\" (the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Poland and France, to name but a few) and sanitized history.  The author notes that the same type of accommodation allowed European nations emerging from the wreckage of the USSR (during the breakup extending from 1989-1991) to initially adopt the posture of \\"occupied nations\\", evolving later to nostalgia for the drab social security provided by the Communist governments, all-the-while (in many cases) retaining the lack of insight required for critical self-study.  Eventually, of course, insight developed, more-or-less coincident with the emergence of the \\"European mentality\\" and with the transition of leadership to a younger generation, one he considers more interested in forthright and candid investigations of wartime events. As a qualifier, however, he also acidly reports on the gross failure of the EU, Russia and others to deal with the Serbian atrocities perpetrated against Muslims (Bosnia), citing (as just one example) the massacre of over 7000 civilians in Screbrenica, an act committed under the eyes of Dutch troops), suggesting perhaps that maybe not much has changed after all.<br /><br />Judt devotes much thought to the nature of Europe and compares/contrasts the European social/governmental \\"contract\\" to the approach taken by the US, generally to the detriment of the latter. Each and every one of his observations on this and other topics are brilliantly stated and carefully interlaced with factual detail.<br /><br />In summary, this is a superb history.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Chris, Chris, Chris,  What the heck is this album?  Love your music no matter who you sing with and your solo albums.  I bought this album when I seen it had been released.  I had no clue what to expect but,DAMN, I never expected to hear some kind of techno Eurpeon music with your lyrics!  Scrub the tracks , insert some guitars, lay down some regular drum tracks, let your soulful voice have free reign, and you will have a great album! Miss You, hope to hear you soon!  Still a fan, but not on this one bud.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|The plot of \\"The White Tiger\\" is fast-paced, it never stalls.  Although we're introduced to many characters in the book, each is fully fleshed out, human, and deliciously flawed in their own way.  I enjoy the uniqueness of the narration: the book is a series of letters, \\"lessons in entrepreneurship,\\" to China's premier Wen Jiabao on the occasion of his visit to India, penned by one of Bangalore's leaning entrepreneurs/murderers.  I read \\"The White Tiger\\" in about 2 days, despite not having a ton of free time.  Aravind Adiga kept me reading well into the night, and boy am I tired now!  TGIF.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|I was one of the people who waited for Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog to appear on the web and was instantly hooked.  This is classic Joss Whedon with the boost of Neil Patrick Harris and Whedon favorites - Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day.  The songs are wonderful, snarcastic and very catchy and the DVD extras give you more than you even imagined (such as the first ever sing-along commentary).    The only downfall of the entire DVD is its format (otherwise, this would have gotten a 5 star rating).  I have an older DVD player and therefore does not play in the DVD-R format.  Therefore, the only way for me to view this is via my computer, which I didn't need as I had already purchased the main piece on iTunes.  I wish, prior to me ordering this DVD, Amazon.com had noted it was in the DVD-R format.    Overall, though, I'm glad I have the DVD for at least the extras which aren't available via iTunes.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|Don't expect grunge/metal. Approach this cd as rock/dance/r&b. Let go of Chris's past.  If you can do this, you can appreciate this cd for what it is...an interesting collaboration that produces a very listenable and likeable group of songs.  It's a cd for a warm spring day, blasting on the car stereo as you drive to the beach.  Embrace the present and turn up the volume.
0767803434|3.0|Air Force One (1997) Harrison Ford is the President of the United States. Gary Oldman is a hardliner Russian who has just hijacked the title vehicle, and off we go in the new thriller from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy (Fargo), Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and Timothy Carhart (Beverly Hills Cop III). The action and suspense are plentiful, though it possibly goes on slightly too long, maybe sticking in one crisis too many before the end credits. Still in all, that's a minor quibble, and this is still a fine flick to check out!
B000001ESN|5.0|I have really started to become a big fan of Rush lately. They are simply without question one of the best, and I DO mean one of the best progressive rock bands ever, and they're also in my opinion the best rock band to come out of Canada. Their seventh full length release from 1980 Permanent Waves is an amazingly brilliant progressive rock masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Rush's best albums as well. I've really been listening to this album a lot lately ever since I got it a little while back, and it has really become one of my favorite classic/progressive rock CD's as of late, and even though I love metal, but I've also been a sucker for good classic rock, and Rush are truly one of a kind. With Terry Brown once again producing, Permanent Waves showcases Rush mixing their brand of progressive/hard rock with a more radio-friendly style, and the results are just excellent. They've also drifted away from the sci-fi/fantasy lyrical themes (that were present on &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34; and &#34;Hemispheres&#34;) and moved to more human related topics as well. This album is practically short, being only 35 minutes, and there are only six songs, but they're all excellent and worth mentioning of course with the acception of the two popular singles &#34;The Spirit of Radio&#34; and &#34;Freewill&#34;, and longer proggish cuts &#34;Jacobs Ladder&#34; and &#34;Natural Science&#34;. Frontman Geddy Lee is an awesome vocalist, and while he does sing at lower ranges on here, but he still has that unique high range especially on &#34;The Spirit of Radio&#34; and &#34;Natural Science&#34;. He's also an amazing bassist as well, his bass lines are just clean, sharp and downright awesome throughout. The guitar work of Alex Lifeson is awesome as well. His riffs are just fantastic and his solos are excellent especially on &#34;Freewill&#34; which features one of his most memorable solos ever. Neil Peart's drumming is just amazing and powerful, and his lyrics are simply brilliant and very intelligent as well. He is truly one of rock's all time best and most legendary drummers, and he's also a true lyrical genius too.<br /><br />Now here's a look at the songs.<br /><br />Kicking off Permanent Waves is the highly energetic and ever-so popular radio hit &#34;The Spirit of Radio&#34; which lyrically deals with of course the radio, and it's effect on us music listeners. This song is truly one of Rush's most popular songs and one of my favorites by them as well. This song features some of the most recognizable guitar riffs in all of rock. The chorus is very catchy and memorable, and I also like that line from the second verse &#34;ONE LIKES TO BELIEVE IN THE FREEDOM OF MUSIC&#34;. There's also a cool reggae part, as well as an awesome screaming guitar solo by Alex. Next up, we have &#34;Freewill&#34; which is another popular radio cut that deals with personal beliefs, and the consequences of them whether they're positive or negative. There's also that awesome, whirling guitar solo by Alex around 3:14, and as I mentioned before it's one of Alex's most memorable solos that he's ever done, and the chorus is just great too. Track three &#34;Jacobs Ladder&#34; is a 7 minute epic and mysteriously atmospheric prog-rocker, and one of the more proggish songs on the album that is highlighted by an awesome, steady melodic guitar solo by Alex, along with unbreakable walls of fierce, crunching riffs, and there's also a bizzare yet awesomely atmospheric synthesizer piece from Geddy in the middle. This song has really become one of my favorite Rush songs lately, it's just simply awesome, no questions asked. Track four &#34;Entre Nous&#34; is an awesome intellectual-oriented ballad that features subtle, yet commanding singing vocals by Geddy, and nice catchy melodic guitar work by Alex including some great riffs in the verses, as well as some nice synth parts. The chorus is very nice and melodic with some nice acoustic guitars backing it up. &#34;Different Strings&#34; is a nice acoustic ballad (which is much more softer than the previous track) that features some guest piano from the band's long-time cover artist Hugh Syme, and finally we come to the epic 9 minute closer &#34;Natural Science&#34; which is written in three sections: &#34;Tide Pools&#34;, &#34;Hyperspace&#34; and &#34;Permanent Waves&#34;. Lyrically, &#34;Natural Science&#34; mostly deals with nature and the environment. I like how the song starts out with the sound of a calm ocean tide, and then it's followed by nice acoustic guitar section, before breaking into serious hard rocking territory with an assault of frantic, crunching guitar riffs (as well as some great soloing by Alex) pounding bass lines, powerful drumming, and commanding vocals that will immediately grab your attention, until the song ends with a full ocean tide. This song is without question an epic prog-rocker, and definitely one of the most epic songs that Rush have written.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: ALL OF THEM OF COURSE!!<br /><br />All in all, Permanent Waves is without a doubt an epic classic/progressive rock masterpiece that is truly one of Rush's best albums in their discography. This album is an absolute must have for every single Rush fan young or old. I also recommend &#34;Moving Pictures&#34;, &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34;, &#34;Hemispheres&#34; and even &#34;2112&#34; as well.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|Every frame of this classic looks great.  A must have for anyone who loves the Disney animated classics.  You can pause this movie almost anywhere and be impressed with the Disney artists' fine work.  Great restoration.  This movie has never looked or sounded better.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|The Extended cut of Ghost Rider takes the average-quality movie, Ghost Rider, and turns it into a movie worth watching. The added and extended scenes add a touch of humor and character to the film, which the theatrical release lacked to a great degree. While the extended cut of Ghost Rider is still not quite on-par with some other superhero and comic movies that have come out recently, it certainly isn't going to be left behind by any Tobey Macguire-starring sequels!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray's enhanced visuals really flesh out the truly superb computer effects and filmwork for this movie, as well. All in all, I give this blu-ray-enhanced version of the movie a 4 out of 5.

B000W91RUG|4.0|Once in a while you watch a television show and, within five minutes, know that the writers \\"get it\\".  This is one of those shows.  From the first episode, the cast clicked, the writing worked, and it was a blast to watch.  I've watched each episode on this set several times, and I still find I'm laughing out loud.<br /><br />Now the bad news...<br /><br />The DVD set has no extras, and their absence makes a difference.  Would it be that hard to shoot a few \\"get to know the actors\\" bonus features?  How about commentary on at least the pilot?  Or even a few words from Chuck Lorre about his title cards?  Nope.  Not here.  You'd think a show about the kind of geeks that get into DVD bonus features would include bonus features on the DVD.<br /><br />But the show itself is great.  Buy a copy.<br /><br />EDIT: So much for my credibility.  I just realized there is one extra, a short called \\"Quantum Mechanics of the Big Bang Theory.  A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic.\\"  But I still would have liked some commentary tracks!

B001PPGAIA|1.0|Please! DO NOT waste your money buying this moronic drivel. It's all very pretty but it's what Hollywood \\"entertainment\\" has become: irretrievably STUPID, dumbed-down eye candy, sound and fury signifying NOTHING. And Nicole Kidman is the reigning queen of embarassing, overwrought, paint-by-numbers \\"acting\\". Calling this film BORING would be rewarding this 2 and 1/2 hour load with heaping praise.  This movie (I only rented it, fortunately) is SO bad I could stomach only about 30 minutes of it before fleeing in despair that American movie-making could sink this low in its furious quest for a big-dollar ROI. The cartoonish beginning was an early tipoff: \\"Help! Not another  idiotic, two-dimensional Indiana Jones clone!\\" But sure enough....  This is the absolute perfect vehicle for a generation that thinks watching \\"The Simpsons\\" is time well spent. Toss this clunker into the Hollywood Cultural Sinkhole along with 99% of everything else it foists upon a gullible, apathetic audience. Don't soil your consciousness on this \\"Zero stars\\" nonsense. You'll be sorry.
031606792X|5.0|First of all, I am 33 years old, and I fell in love with Twilight just last week. I have read all four books now, and Breaking Dawn is my favorite. I don't know why people want to post with such hate for the books, I don't understand. I am in love with them! I have not been this excited over books since Harry Potter came out! I am sick of the comparisons to Harry Potter, there is no comparison! Get over that Bella loves Edward, and would do anything for him! I don't find Bella whiny, I find her quite strong in what she believes and what she wants, and that is Edward.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn had some turns that quite surprised me. **SPOILERS**<br />Such as Bella having a baby and almost dying from it. I did not see that one coming! I was a little disappointed with the ending. I expected this huge war where I though that maybe Renesseme (not sure if I spelled it right) would be the one to have some special power to save them, I was glad to find that Bella had her special power, but I did expect the war to last longer than it did. They did not even fight!<br />When the war first started, I was so worried, I saw there was only a few pages left, and I thought there is no way they can fight, then end with finding out what happened to all of them after the war, but it ended nicely enough, but like I said I was a little disappointed with the ending, but still love the book.
0689859368|4.0|The Grace Family has been going through some hard times.  The parents have divorced.  Jared has taken it harder than his siblings and started getting into trouble.  It's why a fresh start is what he needs, even if he doesn't want it.<br /><br />They have moved to the estate of a distant relative.  No one has lived in it for a long time, and it is in disrepair.  That might explain the strange sounds that Jared, his twin Simon, and their older sister Mallory hear in the walls the first night, right?  Exploring a little more, the trio discover an old manuscript.  Does it hold the key to all the strange things happening?<br /><br />Having really enjoyed the movie last year, I finally started reading the books.  At just over 100 small pages, this book reads very fast.  I finished it in about an hour.  Of course, I am a tad older than the target audience.<br /><br />Even so, I felt the book was mostly set up.  Yes, there is a story and resolution here, but it is almost all background that I have a feeling will be expanded on in the next four books.  It probably doesn't help that I know where the story is going thanks to the movie.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable fantasy that will capture kids' imaginations.  The price does seem a little high for what you get, however.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but after waiting months to finally buy this CD, I only wish I'd bought it sooner! The first time I listened to it I thought it was pretty good. But here, 10-12 times later, I LOVE IT! He's got a very sexy voice, lots of great transitions, very emo, very intense. There's no boring songs lulling you to sleep, no awful rock that I have to turn off. There's so much emotion in every song - Cook is such a talented musician, not only able to sing, but even his arrangement choices are fantastic.  I LOVE Declaration, Light on, Life on the Moon, Mr. Sensitive, Lie, Avalanche and The Time of My Life. Permanent always tears me up! If you like intensity and sexiness to your music, then you're going to love this! I CAN'T WAIT to hear Cook in person and buy any other record he creates!!
0765350386|4.0|I really enjoyed the magic system of this book. Pretty creative blend of alchemy and jedi mind tricks.    When Kelsier first started flying around at the beginning of the book I thought it seemed rather silly. Almost like fantasy meets a comic book. But as the story progressed I found myself really getting into it. Yeah the battles between the mistborn become an actionfest but I found myself NOT rolling my eyes but instead sitting at the edge of my seat.    The plot twist near the end is quite good and well thought out. And I found even my cynical middle agedness giving in to the innocent romance.    Overall a very good book. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B001GM28HO|5.0|Hello! I am going to review all of the songs and I'm sure you'll agree with me!    Just Dance- A really good song to dance to! In the chorus she just sings \\"Just Dance\\" though. It's TOTALLY electrified which doesn't show off her nice vocals. 8/10    LoveGame- A very good song. VERY, VERY, VERY VERY inappropriate! I wanna take a ride on your disco stick!!?? I'm educated in (you know what!!??) ...with a smile on your face and youre hand on your huh!?? It is very innapropriate. Although it is a hell of a good song. 9/10    Paparazzi- This is a nice slow song about her loving a famous dude. Not innapropriate. 10/10    Poker Face- This is a good one. Totally electrified, but it is AWESOME!   12/10    Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)- BORING!!! All is says is \\"EH EH\\" it is the stupidest song ever! Whenever I'm listening to the album at that krap comes on, i actually skip it!! You should too. 0/10    Beautiful, Dirty Rich- It's good. It says \\"BEAUTIFUL DIRTY RICH\\" a lot.  9/10    The Fame- OH MY GOD!!! This song rocks! She sounds like Shakira in the first two words. It has a rockin' guitar riff in the beginning!  10/10    Money Honey- It does to chorus over and over and over! It's an annoying song, but it gets stuck in your head!  5/10    Starstruck- This doesn't even sound like a real voice! It sounds like a robot! And if she was singing they must have pressed a billion buttons. They made it so electrified it sounds so amazingly incredibly annoying!! Don't ever listen to this song if you find your ears with value.  -11/10    Boys Boys Boys- It says \\"BOYS BOYS BOYS!\\" a lot. It mentions the kinds of boys she likes. Boys in cars, buy her drinks in bars, and ones with hairspray and denim.  6/10    Paper Gangsta- It's a really cool title although not really a cool song.   8/10    Brown Eyes- My CD i s skippy so i couldn't hear this one  ?/10    I Like It Rough- I like this one more than \\"JUST DANCE\\". It's nice and slow. Kinda like \\"PAPARAZZI\\"  16/10    Summerboy- I haven't heard\\"SUMMERBOY\\" yet.  ?/10
B000O75VSK|4.0|Windows Media classifies After Forever simply as \\"metal,\\" and I can think of no better description for this recording.  Any metal fan will most likely find something appealing.  As with most identifiably \\"metal\\" styles, the guitar, bass, and drums are predictably unified in tight unisons, grooves, and riffs, creating a wall of sound that seemingly harnesses the voices of Nordic gods.  When mythologically large guitars just aren't big enough, After Forever refers to metal's great-grandfather - the Wagerian orchestra.<br /><br />If this description seems over-the-top, it is intended as such.  There is no lack of bombast on \\"After Forever.\\"  Although the traces of \\"classic\\" metal can be teased out (Dokken, Scorpions, and Dio, for example), and periodically the ghost of Dream Theater wanders the halls, it is Queensryche's melodramatic approach that is most palpable.  If you can imagine Pat Benatar singing lead for Queensryche with one of Dream Theater's early keyboardists on board, you might be able to approximate the band's sound.<br /><br />Lead singer Floor Jansen is in incredible form on \\"After Forever.\\"  Occasionally, she sheds her Benataresque rock voice and veers into fully operatic style, possibly toeing the line on acceptable bombast.  I don't like it when male vocalists go there, and now I know that I am not sexist in this prejudice.  Live and learn.  Most of the time, however, her voice is powerful, distinctive, and feminine - possibly one of the better lead voices working today.  After Floor, keyboardist Joost van den Broek also deserves mention.  At the inception of metal, a keyboardist was considered bad mojo, and bands like Europe did little to refute this conception.  However, Dream Theater changed that considerably, especially when Jordan Rudess came on board.  A metal keyboardist now must be both a synthesist and a technician, and Joost's post-Wakeman approach fills both of these roles admirably.  I would suggest that he is a key member of the group, a proposition that is only cemented by the searching piano track \\"Lonely.\\"<br /><br />Despite having respectable proggish chops, the band is not overly technical.  They strongly emphasize melody, and there is plenty to sing along with.  Although they employ death-metal style grunt vocals at times, they are used sparingly and, as a result, play a great foil to Jansen's clearly masterful performance.  I might venture to call After Forever \\"pan-metallic\\" because the band dips into every possible metal genre, including prog-, thrash-, goth-, death-, symphonic-, and even pop- to create a cohesive and relatively accessible effort.  If it were released during the era of Queensryche's \\"Empire,\\" \\"Energize\\" could have garnered a level of popularity, but the day of the prog-metal single is sadly probably over.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN: If you dig metal, in any form, there will most likely be something about \\"After Forever\\" that you will like - and perhaps something that you will not.  In my case, the occasional histrionics make me roll my eyes, but I can't help but bang my head and sing along most of the time.  It is a shame that, although this is my first exposure to them, this is the last After Forever project, as the band has broken up.  Happily, though, they ended on a high note and now I have the pleasure of checking out their back catalog.tion that is only cemented by the searching piano track \\"Lonely.\\"    Despite having respectable proggish chops, the band is not overly technical.

0525951113|5.0|This is a great book.  As a computer scientist I'm usually pretty tough on writers that venture into this genre, but Suarez has done his research.

0345495004|5.0|I have to quit saying, \\"This is the best book I've ever read!\\" so, this is one of the best. If you like history, architecture, human emotion and great writing - you'll love this book. I knew about Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW) but had no idea about his personal life and how it shaped him throughout his career. Nancy Horan pieced together facts and personalities to make this book come to life. Whether you agree with the decisions Frank and his mistress, Mamah, made or not - it makes for a great discussion. I would highly recommend it for your book club.    Most people have heard about FLW and this book gives you a humanistic understanding to his background. You learn more about Frank while at the same time get a glimpse of what the early 1900's society was like. Wow, what an ego he had! My favorite FLW quote Nancy included was, \\"Rules were made for ordinary men and therefore don't apply to me because I'm extraordinary\\" or something like that. Nonetheless, his vision was genius. His story, remarkable.    The nice surprise, or tragedy, was the background Ms. Horan dug up on Mamah. Her decisions alone would make for a heated discussion among a group. This is what makes a book really good. Nancy presents the facts in a beautifully written piece. I would highly recommend reading this book. And if you can ever get a chance to see one of FLW's buildings - don't miss it.

0312383320|1.0|I am extremely disappointed in one of Amazon's sellers.  I never received my book and when I sent a note to the seller to ask where my order was, I never received a response.  I will never do business with this seller again.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|When I saw the G13 on Amazon, I was VERY excited, as Logitech tends to execute well and have strong ergonomics, all the way back to the original Mouseman Wheel which revolutionized mice and to this day has not been matched in comfort.  Or the Cyberman 2 which is legendary among those who owned one (or had to play against someone who owned one). I was in the midst of getting sucked back into WoW, and decided to investigate the current crop of input devices to see if I could improve on my nearly worn out Nostromo n52 and Logitech MX Revolution.    The package arrived, I installed the lastest software, bound my keys and was off. Right off the bat I knew this device was horribly flawed. It simply does not work ergonomically. Basically, it's way too flat and doesn't conform to the natural shape of the hand. Because of this, the thumb stick is awkward to use, and pressing different keys will tend to either move your hand from a proper rest position, or require many muscles working in conjunction to keep your position which ends up contorting the shape of your hand and leading to discomfort and muscle stress.    Now many readers are probably thinking, \\"What the hell is this guy talking about, he's just being an overly picky wuss.\\" Now believe me, I would LOVE to love this device. I've been using an n52 for years, and despite its flaws (not enough buttons, horrible software, unusable shift modes), still love it and have even bought them for friends. I love my MX Revolution even though that it is not quite as comfortable as some mice and has low dpi for gaming. I use the best products available, and learn to work around their flaws. But quite simply, you CAN NOT work around ergonomics. Trying to do so overly stresses one's finger and wrist muscles and puts one at risk for RSI which is NOT NOT NOT A GOOD THING TO DO.    Now, if you think I am exaggerating the ergonomic failures of this device, put your hand on your mouse and look at it. Your thumb is probably rotated 90 degrees in relation to the rest of your fingers, so that if you closed your hand your thumb would curl under your fingers. This is a feature known as opposable thumbs. Pick your hand off the mouse and hold it in front of you while resting all your fingers and thumb, it retains the same basic shape as when on your mouse.  Pretend to hold a modern gamepad, the hand shape is the same but with your wrists turned.    Now look at the picture of the G13. In order to use the thumb stick, you either have to put your thumb on it sideways which makes it hard to control as your thumb has to move unnaturally to push the stick forward / back, or rotate your thumb flat in relation to the rest of your fingers. Pretend to put your hand on the G13 with your thumb flat on the stick. Your hand will naturally want to two things, open up a bit, and rotate so that your pinky is lower than your index finger. Look at the g13 again... the keyboard section is totally flat, so you have to reverse the natural rotation by using your muscles to reshape your hand. Not only is this uncomfortable and stressful to your hand, but it makes it harder to use the keys because your muscles are already engaged in holding position. hitting anything other than the 'home' keys requires many muscles working in conjunction, putting further stress on your hand and deceasing your speed and accuracy.    YES, bad ergonomics will decrease your gaming performance. A lot, compared to a similar device with good ergonomics.    On top of this, the thumb stick has quite a long throw, which makes it suboptimal for use as a digital input (eg: WASD, or ESDF). If you're using it as analog (which I understand is currently unsupported officially but will be in a future driver version) it would be nice though.    On the plus side, the Logitech software is excellent, as usual. A few steps beyond where is was a couple years ago. The backlighting and LCD panel are actually much cooler than I thought they would be, and add a nice fun / pizazz factor that is pleasing. There are plenty of buttons on the device, and they are laid out in a manner that makes sense, despite the flatness of the keypad. And it looks cool, seems solidly built, and does not slip around.    However, I cannot recommend this device to anyone who is going to use the stick. Yes, there are many 5 star ratings on this, despite it's shortcomings. Many of these reviewers are using a 'gameboard' for the first time and haven't tried better ones.  Many others aren't using the stick. If you aren't using the stick, what is the point of a device like this? Using your thumb for movement frees up all your fingers for actions. If you're going to use the keys for WASD / ESDF you're better off getting the best keyboard you can find. Some reviewers say, \\"you have to get used to it.\\" Of course this is true of any input device, but you should not have to get used to ergonomics. When people first use a mouse they have to get used to the input controls, but they don't say \\"Ouch, my hand is uncomfortable in this position.\\" Getting used to hand discomfort is dangerous as it leads to RSI, as well as lowering your gaming performance as you are constantly fighting the non-natural hand shape.    This device has TONS of potential, and it is great to see the big guns of Logitech get into this market. I tried on and off for weeks to like the G13, however its flaws are too deep and sink this first offering. Hopefully down the road Logitech releases a new version and this device causes Belkin / Saitek to step up their product line. But for now, steer clear of the G13. The n52 with third party driver software or simple keybindings is the better choice.    -- My Current Setup --  [[ASIN:B000HCT12O Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse (Black)]]  [[ASIN:B000WMEHYG Belkin n52te Tournament Edition SpeedPad]]  [[ASIN:B000A6PPOK Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000]]    For gaming I set the MX Revolution thumb forward / back / press to hold Shift / Ctrl / Alt, which multiplies the available functions on the n52. It is a very strong, comfortable setup that gives me quick access to many, many actions without resorting to the n52's horrible 'shift modes'.  If you have the means, I highly recommend picking these up.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This album continues to represent the best of recorded music. When an established band throws caution to the wind and ventures to produce something different and unexpected. It's the third in a trilogy that started with Achtung Baby....but continued the experimentation to breaking point. To my ears there is a brilliant creative tension in these songs. To many its a fruitless foray into techno, but i think these are just the protestations of traditionalists and nostalgics. The backlash has forced the band into an over secure formula that has produced ATYCLB, HTDAAB and NLOTH. Not bad records by any stretch but when put out as three consecutive releases it's a bit underwhelming. But what it does is renew my love for POP.     I know U2 complains that they did not get to finish the album in the way they wanted due to time constraints related to their pre-booking of the POP Mart tour. But I will leave them to deal with that disappointment. In the meantime....I reserve my right to LOVE IT!!!
B001P3SA94|3.0|NOT based on a true story, rather inspired (very) loosely by a true story.  If looking for some blues history, definitely go elsewhere, it surely ain't here. And any self-respecting guitar player / guitar lover will be appaled by the sight of \\"Muddy Waters\\" playing that goldtop Gibson Les Paul, instead of the candy apple red Fender Telecaster which made his sound over 30 years. And speaking of historical errors, Waters was the man to shock England by means of electric blues as far back as 1958.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Quentin Tarantino's ongoing love affair with women's feet continues with DEATH PROOF.  That's about it, really.<br /><br />Nothing else really works in this movie.  None of the women characters are ever believable.  Their dialogue feels like badly-recycled parodies of PULP FICTION and RESEVOIR DOGS.  The story is so thin that you yearn to just watch any of the drive-in grindhouse movies from the 1970s because at least they were better written!<br /><br />I was hoping that the KILL BILL movies would've got all the \\"homage\\" tendencies out of Tarantino and that he would start making real movies again.  No.  DEATH PROOF is only more, and worse.<br /><br />Posturing, pointless.  Forgettable.  A waste of a good cast.  The only moments that come close to capturing the spirit of the drive-in movies are the Coming Attractions trailers...that aren't included in the DVD, from what I understand.
B001P3SA94|4.0|Cadillac Records tells the story of Chess Records, a recording company founded by the two Chess brothers. Chess Record helped make Etta James, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf and so many more artists famous or even living legends; and that's wonderful. The plot moves along at a good pace although this is not the way things happened in real life and that's a shame. For example, there were two Chess brothers but in this film we only see one of them, Leonard Chess. The plot is also a bit complicated since there are several principle actors in this film. Nevertheless, Cadillac Records is a story about music and race relations; it provides a great deal of insight into just how well good music brought about positive change in American society. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for the crowded fight scenes really shines. The acting is outstanding.<br /><br />The movie itself begins with a brief shot of Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) who narrates at times to tell the entire story as a flashback. We quickly meet Leonard Chess (Adrian Brody), an ambitious young man who wants to get ahead in this world. Leonard first opens a club in Chicago; but just about the time he meets a few budding artists including Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright), Little Walter (Columbus Short) and Jimmy Rogers (Kevin Mambo), Leonard's nightclub mysteriously burns down. Leonard takes the insurance money and buys space for a recording studio--and after a few bribes to some disc jockeys he gets his first recordings from these artists onto the airwaves. Their careers take off like soaring jets and Chess Records clearly will be around to stay. Leonard also starts a tradition that if a singer makes a hit record he will reward them with a Cadillac. Over time other budding artists including Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Etta James (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) become part of the \\"family\\" that is Chess Records.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch the movie; we see how fatherly Leonard Chess is to his team. For example, Chess always makes sure that Muddy Waters has some money to get by long after Muddy's records have stopped selling. Unfortunately, however, we also see Leonard begin to cheat on his wife Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui) with Etta James; and Muddy Waters and other musicians sometimes accuse Leonard of taking advantage of them. In addition, these musicians carry enough weapons on them to make me think this is some kind of gangster movie cloaked in the guise of a musical! There's much more action in this movie, too.<br /><br />But the plot is really not the true message of this film. It's particularly important to tell this story because so few people remember who Muddy Waters was; they may not own any of his albums and I myself had never heard of Howlin' Wolf or Willie Dixon. I enjoyed some incredible acting as the movie shows the creative and interpersonal tensions between them that must have built up over years of working together so closely.<br /><br />The DVD has a couple of featurettes about the film and how they made it happen. There are deleted scenes and we get an optional commentary with writer/director Darnell Martin.<br /><br />Cadillac Records may not be the most truthful take on the history of Chess Records; but it packs a punch and it's quite enjoyable. You'll learn a lot about some great musicians, all of whom broke ground in their day. I highly recommend this for music aficionados and musicals in general.he movie; we see how fatherly Leonard Chess is to his team.

B001KPK6Q2|1.0|Taylor does a very good job on writing lyrics and music, however she is not a very good singer.  Her voice is thin and does not deliver where it's needed.

B000VWYNOG|4.0|Van Morrison's CD entitled Still on Top: The Greatest Hits definitely omitted some of his great, great work; but as a single CD retrospective I guess it's about as good as we could get. One thing is certain: They did made the mistake of not putting songs like \\"Tupelo Honey\\" and \\"Mystic Eyes\\" on this album! Van Morrison possesses great talent and I love to hear these songs over and over; there's a strong energy in Van Morrison's voice that truly makes these tunes memorable. The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork is very well done.<br /><br />The CD starts with two tracks that come from the time when Van Morrison was making music with Them; and these two opening numbers make a strong start for this album. \\"Gloria\\" has a great late `60s/early `70s sound to it that I love; \\"Gloria\\" is a tune that many people will recognize even if they didn't know it was \\"Them\\" that recorded this one. \\"Brown Eyed Girl,\\" a true Van Morrison classic, always impressed me so much; this joyful song is timeless. The guitar work is terrific and Van Morrison never sounded better. He handles the tempo and key changes like a champ! \\"Moondance\\" is another major highlight of this album; Van Morrison's creativity lets him bat this straight out of the ballpark and that's all right with me!<br /><br />\\"Wild Night\\" features Van Morrison front and center; his singular talent makes \\"Wild Night\\" unforgettable and I really like \\"Wild Night.\\" \\"Warm Love\\" is a more laid-back tune that has great vocals and \\"Warm Love\\" gets a fine woodwind arrangement. In addition, \\"Bright Side Of The Road\\" shines brightly when Van Morrison and the musicians do this one up right! \\"Bright Side Of The Road\\" is carefully written to sound so beautiful; and it makes a fine addition to the song set on this album. Similarly, \\"Dweller On The Threshold\\" features Van Morrison squarely front and center and those backup singers harmonize to perfection--and beyond! Van Morrison never really needed vocal backup; but they do sound good.<br /><br />\\"In The Garden\\" uses a slight echo effect to enhance the natural beauty of this ballad; Van Morrison performs this faultlessly and I love it! The guitar works fits in just right with the vocals, too. \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\\" is an old standard that proves Van Morrison can sing the classic pop vocals along with the best of them; and that's grand. I also like \\"The Healing Game\\" with its great arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Precious Time\\" has a fine beat that makes you want to jump up and dance practically wherever you are; and the CD ends strong with a song entitled \\"Stranded.\\" \\"Stranded\\" has a pretty melody even though the lyrics aren't all that sunny; yet this combination actually makes the ballad stronger.<br /><br />Still on Top: The Greatest Hits is the perfect place to start for anyone just getting into Van Morrison. It's also a fairly good single CD retrospective despite a few flaws. Once you enjoy this album as much as I do, you will want to delve deeper into Van Morrison's artistry by getting some of his other albums. You can then hear some of the incredible tunes that aren't on this single CD retrospective.\\"In The Garden\\" uses a slight echo effect to enhance the natural beauty of this ballad; Van Morrison performs this faultlessly and I love it!

0780021150|4.0|M is the story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre), a man who walks the streets and lures children to him through candy and balloons. Soon, the whole town is in fear of their children's lives, so they follow them around like mad. The trouble is, the criminals are being watched more closely now too, so it is difficult for them to earn their living (albiet in a less-than-moral way). They band together to catch the criminal, and take him to their own court to render a verdict.<br /><br />There are some points when the early sound technology causes this film to suffer, but director Fritz Lang does a great job of getting around some of the restrictions. Instead of allowing the camera to become stagnant, he shoots the scenes as silent scenes and then dubs in the dialogue later. This is not noticable because there are no close-ups on faces; there are no lips moving out of sequence with the sound. There are times when there is no sound at all, and then it is broken by piercing noises. This makes them more noticable and jarring, although one might be drawn out of the movie by the initial silence.<br /><br />There are some great scenes, though. One involves cutting from the criminals creating a strategy to catch the murderer to the police doing the same. Lang uses the Peer Gynt Suite to illustrate a scene where the murderer tries to lure another child to him. There are some great overhead shots as well. At the trial, Lang films actors facing the camera directly, which creates a claustrophobic feeling. Although no violence is shown, and nothing is explained in great detail, the construction of the film is so good that this movie's subject will disturb you just the same. Credit must be given to Lorre whose performance is very powerful.
0375842209|5.0|Usually, I am skeptical when I hear that everyone else likes a book or movie. I can't help to feel that it's being blown out of proportion and that it just can't be that good. This book is quite the exception.<br /><br />Narrated by Death, this unique book explores many deep themes including death and dying (no surprise), the power of words, and the beauty of a good friendship. Liesel is a very well developed, three dimensional character, and the supporting characters only add to the amazing story. This book is different from other World-War II era novels, as it takes the view point of a German child. Very little is mentioned about the horrors of the Holocaust, but the book instead focuses on the average German during the war and also brings up several good questions, such as 'Was it right for the Allies to bomb civilians?'<br /><br />Zusak proves to be a master of symbolism and metaphors - even the cover of the book (falling dominoes) symbolizes something far more treacherous. I've read this book three times, and pick up on something new every time I read it. It is by far the best book I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Please don't skip over this book because it is labeled as 'young adult.' Just because the main character is a young girl doesn't mean only young girls can read this book. I think anyone, any age could enjoy this book; however, I think people over the age of 14 or 15 would get the most out of it.<br /><br />Can't wait to see the movie!! (comes out in 2010)

0743289684|5.0|The author of this autobiography is now a member of the American Enterprise Institute.  She's an African feminist atheist you want to listen to.  Her description of female circumcision is horrifying.  She herself was excised at the age of 5 or 6 when her grandmother arranged for this to happen while her parents were away.  The idea of being a \\"pure\\" bride was more important than anything else in her culture.  Some virgins were sewn so tightly shut that they would have to be opened up in the hospital in order for their husbands to consummate their marriages.  But usually, the husband would struggle until he broke through--the bride a numb, torn, bleeding mess.  It was this and other aspects of her former religion that caused her to renounce it and speak for freedom.
B001BVRNPW|5.0|Got this movie for my husband and it's now his fav Star Gate movie. It's just as good as the show itself. A must see movie that the whole family will love, if you love Star Gate than you'll love this movie.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This six-hour television mini-series was as good as advertised, which is saying a lot. I don't prefer long movies but this is very watchable. It's such an interesting story and so-well photographed that you don't mind the long length.    The acting is top-rate, led by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, with a deep cast that includes many well-known actors. As a male, I really enjoyed ogling Diane Lane and I've always liked Glenne Headley, too, although more for her voice.    Fredric Forest is absolutely brutal as the half-breed killer, one of the most unremorseful murderers I've even seen on film. Angelica Huston, Rick Schroeder, Danny Glover, Robert Urtich, D.B. Sweeney and Steve Buscemi all were superb, too.    The story has a great mix of drama, romance, action, sadness and just plain realism. The characters are bold and unrelenting and you find yourself getting wrapped up in this story and with these people, what they went through. It's just great storytelling but - as in real life - it isn't all roses; there's a lot of sadness here.
B001K98MFK|5.0|If you have even a passing interest in Ghost in the Shell you need to add this to your collection. Picks up after the Puppet Master episode of the first movie and continues the story. That being said it has nothing to do with the Stand Alone story arcs so keep that in mind. The CG animation is amazing and while the story does have a few weak points it is an overall great movie. Cannot recommend this one enough.
B001TH16DI|4.0|The product isn't even out on Blu-Ray yet and you guys are bashing a product you haven't even seen or heard, based on what they are releasing.  I agree they need to release special editions of these movies and roll out the red carpet, but lets be realistic before we make judgement calls on the quality of these movies that are not out yet on this format!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Goonies has been one of my favorite movies since childhood which is probably one of the reasons I love it so much and can find no fault with it at all.  Basically, Goonies is an Indiana Jones for kids but the adventure isn't halfway around the world it's in your own backyard.  The movie always gave me hope that maybe there is more to my boring neighborhood than meets the eye.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it thoroughly entertained. It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film! No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.    Mostly there are nothing but bad folks in here and a lot of ultra-violent scenes, one-after-the-other. You also have other cliché prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since \\"The Longest Yard.\\" Beware of jiggling hand-held camera scenes, if that kind of thing gives you a headache.    Having said that, I admit the film is interesting start-to-finish, the racing scenes terrific, the film effectively manipulative, and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment. Statham is the new Steve Seagal, Jean-Claude VanDamme, etc - but that's okay; some of their movies were fun to watch, too.
1400064287|5.0|The book answers one question: What makes an idea stick to our minds? The question is profound because it asks why some ideas are better remembered than others, why some methods of communication are more effective, and why a message should be specifically packaged to achieve the intended impact. The answer involves six principles spelled SUCCES: simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, story.     What's brilliant about \\"Made to Stick\\" is: authors Chip and Dan Heath use the answer to the question to make the answer stick to our minds. Not only do they explain how the six principles are used to make an idea stick, they also apply these principles in making their message--the book--be a sticky idea that stays in our consciousness.    The six chapters of \\"Made to Stick\\" focus on the six principles of stickiness. Each chapter uses some, if not all, of the SUCCES principles to deliver the chapter's topic. The language is light and straightforward (because sticky ideas must be simple and memorable, like proverbs). The presentation is captivating, making you pay attention and want more. The numerous references are concrete and credible; in fact we are already familiar with many of them (like Jared, the Subway guy, the Chicken Soup series, and the Mother Theresa Effect). And with one story after another, of how regular people used these principles to make an impact, Chip and Dan Heath seal the imprint of their message in our heads.    I have never read a book that skillfully and successfully applies the principles it is trying to teach, until now. With the additional \\"Sticky Advice\\" chapters (for managers and teachers), the Easy Reference Guide, and the hundreds of fascinating reference notes, I can say \\"Made to Stick\\" will be stuck to my fingers for a while.  - Ruby Bayan, OurSimpleJoys
B0002HYC8C|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my grandchildren and they have had loads of fun with it.  The size is good for the 2 yr old and the complexity of items is good for the 5 yr old.  An added bonus is the storybook included in several languages.  I would rate it as a very good toy for fun and education both.  The only drawback would be the many little parts that an infant should not be allowed to play with.
B00103584Y|5.0|This is one of the more inventive movies of the last 10 years, I would think. It was new, fresh and very different when it came out in the late '90s and still is unique and enjoyable as of this review in early 2009.  The Blu-Ray edition, by the way, is terrific and worth the money. It looks tremendous.<br /><br />The movie is short - 81 minutes - but plenty long when you consider it's three versions of the same story, each version about 25 minutes after an opening introduction.<br /><br />That may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera-work and interesting angles on the same story. Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior, plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either, depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.<br /><br />Franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the \\"Bourne\\" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting. The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear.<br /><br />Added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film.<br /><br />The high rating I give this film could really be summed up in two words: DIFFERENT and FUN.

B001CZVVV4|5.0|This Puritani, which is part of the Metropolitan Opera's series of high definition broadcasts and recordings of live performances, is excellent. The staging is quite conventional, sets and costumes are beautiful, and the singing, especially Netrebko and Relyea, is excellent. The fact that it is available in high definition (Blueray) is an added bonus.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Always loved Striesand's music & knowing that she expects nearly perfection, this movie shows her true dedication & roots to the struggle of a woman seeking acceptance & the braveness & tenacity to reveal who she really is inside.  The musical score is impeccable & represents the mood throughout the movie.  I didnt want it to end.  I cant wait till it comes out in blu-ray.

B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple's debut cd is amazing.  I've had it for years- have grown up with it!  Her lyrics are poetic and so lovely- some are heartbreaking.  Her music is memorable and thoughtful- inspiring.  I wouldn't call her rhythms \\"catchy\\", but her songs all cloud my mind and keep me singing long after I've shut off the sound.<br />My favorite song on this album is \\"Never is a Promise\\".  Though I know that her lyrics are a bit more deep than what I relate to them as, who can't relate to being misunderstood?  Who can't relate to having it seem like no one can ever endure the life that you lead in the exact same way that you do?<br />The whole album is amazing, rhythmic, hypnotizing and so astounding.  I can listen to it over and over again.
B000UD08HW|5.0|What an incredible show - If you are a Pink Floyd fan you will love this blu-ray - The sound quality is one of the very best offered out there and the video was great also - although there are some shots that appear a bit grainy - that did not bother me however and I'm pretty fussy - This is a keeper - ENJOY
B000UX6THK|1.0|I don't get all the hype for this series.  The acting was poor, the storyline was incoherent and slow and if it was meant to be a spoof - it was way off the mark.  I didn't get a chuckle, there was no good storyline just a lot of rambling.  If anyone buys this because the photography was great then you are really not in it to buy it for the plot.  Sorry I spent so much money but glad the series ended!
0783222149|3.0|This is an awesome movie. The only problem I have with it, as many of you have found with other movies, is that the sound design is made for theaters and not for home viewing-that is that the quiet parts are too quiet, and the loud parts are too loud. Am I ordering the wrong format? Nevertheless, I recommend this movie with both thumbs up for a family viewing!

0446677450|3.0|This book seems to be incredibly repetitious at the beginning, but it is repeating something which many people searching for financial freedom need to get right, once and for all.<br /><br />Much more than \\"pay yourself first\\" (save money) you need to concentrate all of your effort on buying ASSETS, not LIABILITIES.  In particular, the author squares off with the received wisdom by viewing a home purchase as a liability, not an asset.<br /><br />Well, he's surely not the only person who thinks so.  Warren Buffett among others was a renter until he began to get sincerely prosperous.  My own dad was another (\\"Never try to make money off your home.  After all, you live in it.\\")<br /><br />But, leaving the home aside for a moment, what this guy is saying is quite simple: buy stocks, bonds, commercial paper, commercial real-estate: whatever, but buy ASSETS.  If you run out and buy a new Mercedes-Benz, you have just assumed a huge liability.  If the Benz costs (say) $40,000 --- that $40,000 could be put into stocks, bonds, and apartment houses, where it would probably bring in something like $4,000 a year.  The car is simply an expense of many thousands per year.<br /><br />It's hard to quarrel with this, but two other points of view come to mind.  One is (of all things) \\"Personal Finance for Dummies,\\" which reminds people that money is not the most important thing in life.  Well, in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\\" it IS the most important thing in life.  For all the bragging that Rich Dad does about being the master of money rather than its slave, it seems clear that he works dawn-to-dusk in the service of Money.<br /><br />The other point of view --- really, a point of difference --- comes in the second half of the book, where the author shares his \\"secret\\" methods of growing rich rapidly.  One amounts to flipping and trading real estate --- which may work --- but the other one seems downright zany: cashing in on the IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) of companies which are about to go public.  Well, I have lived through exactly one situation like that: a hot software company was about to go public, and stock options had already been awarded --- and then, at the last moment --- there was another offering for families and friends.  The only people who heard about this offer were precisely the families and friends of employees, plus the people who had initially funded the company (e.g., a group of Swiss investors).<br /><br />This whole thing worked out fairly well for my family  --- my friends all thought that I was trying to sell them penny-stock, and universally hung up in horror when I was trying to do them a favor --- but it strikes me as very unrealistic for Mr. and Mrs. Main Street.<br /><br />Still, all in all, the first half of the book is something to concentrate your mind: what am I buying with my money?  Am I buying assets or liabilities?  Would I be better off (in the long run) with that $1,000 set of golf clubs, or should I settle for some much less expensive golf clubs and sock the rest into investments?<br /><br />Very interesting reading.exactly one situation like that: a hot software company was about to go public, and stock options had already been awarded --- and then, at the last moment --- there was another offering for families and friends.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I was looking for a game to play with my children (10 and 15) and a foreign exchange student (21) over vacation.  I found Blokus and after reading the reviews decided to buy it. Boy, am I ever glad I did.  It is a great game.    It took us just a few moments to get the hang of it. Namely how to put the pieces on the board.  After we played it once we got the hang of it and then we were off.  The game itself doesn't take that long to play (as compared with say Monopoly).  So you can play a couple of times in one sitting.  You do need strategy, you learn as you play how to plan where you will put your pieces, how to stop someone else, etc.  We laugh a lot with this game (I usually threaten to punish my children if they block one of my moves).  It is great for all ages and loads of fun. Well worth it.
B0000067L3|3.0|I know that this was recorded may years ago, but couldn't they have equalized the sound and mastered it with a higher sound level to really make it come alive. Of course the performance of Cream is undisputable. Had it not been for the terrible sound quality I would have given it a 4 stars. Sorry Cream fans.

0143038419|2.0|I ordered from PDXbookstore and it took forever to get my item. The book I originally ordered was supposed to have been in good condition, but when I received it, the cover was covered in chocolate or some sort of food, the book was bent and was far from good condition. I was very disappointed with the service I received from them.
0060922583|1.0|I bought this book due to the intriguing premise of the theory and the hope of finding a theory to unify what mystics have claimed for millennia and recent science is starting to suspect.  And, the book starts off quite well, with good arguments for both the brain and matter behaving in a \\"holographic\\" fashion.  Then it proceeds to run the gamut of the worst side of New Age junk, and this is coming from someone who loves New Age topics.      The book is completely disingenuous and uses numerous case studies where the evidence is presented in a dishonest way.  A simple google search will turn up enough information on many of the books claims to start to raise doubt; further investigation will make you very upset that the evidence is presented so matter-of-factly, with no mention of the numerous controversies surrounding the evidence.      Two easy examples from what I imagine to be a plethora of junk, is the books claim of George Washingtons \\"Vision\\" for America - which is more likely patriotic propaganda than any real prophecy (google it yourself).  Another example is Talbot's  terrible \\"evidence\\" of \\"materialization\\" - citing cult leader Sai Baba -- with no mention of the video evidence showing his slight-of-hand or the numerous pedophilia allegations.      Maybe there are some actual nuggets of the miraculous and / or paranormal in this book, but mixed in with junk like that you'll have to fact check every detail along the way.  It seems more so that the author strung together every wacked out thing he could find in an attempt to have enough material to fill a book and just threw it out there hoping his readers wouldn't bother to research the stuff.      What a shame for what is actually a lovely theory.  As the late great Bill Hicks once mused \\"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream,and we are the imagination of ourselves\\"    We can thank Talbot for making Bill probably take a few spins in his grave.      Read the first couple chapters through an internet preview feature and don't waste your time with the rest.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This movie is amazing, that's really all there is too it.  Every character from The Dude to Jesus comes to life in a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone.  Everytime I watch it i find something new and interesting I hadn't noticed before.  \\"Nobody ****s with the Jesus.\\"
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Obviously anyone who has a blu-ray player is waiting for this release.  However, expecting George Lucas to do anything that makes sense is smoking something.  Sadly enough, I don't think that decisions regarding Star Wars are going to make any sense until he has left this mortal coil.      What I mean by this is that you should expect the blu-ray versions of the movies to come out, although they'll probably come in a box with 1-6 first and 4-6 will be the special editions.  Then they'll eventually release them individually (this process will take about 5 years). Then another 2-3 years after that we'll finally get the original versions of 4-6.  Then 2 years later, a new technology that has 2-4x the resolution of Blu-Ray will become available and this process will all start over again.  But, by then, they'll have remade 4-6 as a completely new movie with new actors,etc...  Yes, I think this will happen.

0385340990|5.0|We found the audio book exceptionally engaging.  Although we have VERY different points of view and family backgrounds, we were happily surprised with this portrayal of the 5-year Nazi occupation of the Islands.  (The very faint religious touches mentioned in a few reviews are not misplaced - there was conflict between the French Catholics and British Church of Englanders.)<br /><br />Perfect example of the difference between simple people and people with simple lifestyles. Five stars seems a lot, but appropriate for light fiction, necessarily a bit superficial.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|The plot synopses of other reviewers will have to do for those who want to know more about the movie's storyline. A couple of weeks ago, I found myself in a bookshop where the movie was being rented by someone, and told them \\"You will LOVE this movie. It's agonizingly slow and sometimes painful, yet the ending is WELL worth sitting through the painful parts [painful as we see Zach's character going through his own changes in the way he sees the world and himself].\\" I have since purchased the movie through Amazon.com, and am waiting on its delivery, and have bought the music soundtrack. All of the laudatory comments in favor of this movie here may be a bit much, yeah [especially so if you read as many of them as I just did] but I believe \\"Shelter\\" deserves it. The story could not be more realistic, I believe, as it is portrayed through the two male leads, and - the other reviewers are right when they say it - the eyes say more and better than words ever could, in real life OR on the silver screen.     A now ages-old phrase - \\"Truth is stranger than fiction\\" - can be honestly paraphrased for this movie, \\"Truth is far more endearing than fiction,\\" as \\"Shelter\\" portrays something we see hardly anywhere from Hollywood, and that is characters that are not caricatures, and portrayed by people who are not being picked for star-power, rather, people who are talented, assisting in bringing us a story worth watching, and caring about. By the way, if you are prone to tears, I would suggest watching it with some tissues at hand, as it has a tendency to evoke some \\"wet\\" moments.     Five stars for \\"Shelter,\\" and definitely a \\"heads-up!!!\\" for the music from the film!!! The music alone brings tears to my eyes, but the movie?!?!? All I can say is \\"WOW!!!\\" I have listened to the CD repeatedly for a solid week now, and only have the 1 CD in my car. Shane Mack's voice - especially so on \\"Lie to Me\\" - may honestly \\"haunt\\" you, as it has me. It is WELL worth the investment for any serious collector, for both the DVD and CD!!!

It is clearly a completely different direction than anything I've ever heard from Chris Cornell, and I like it.  I am looking forward to hearing Cornell in concert in a couple of weeks!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Awesome video.I can't recommend this DVD enough.I have been using this DVD for  about a month now and I can definitely tell a difference.
6305558167|1.0|After reading good reviews of this movie I decided to buy it.  That's the last time I will ever do that!  I'll sum up my feelings about this movie in a few words.  Excalibur is bloody awful and one of the worst movies I've ever seen on this subject.  What a total piece of garbage and a complete waste of my time!  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!

1439102813|5.0|I am the same age as the main character Alice. It really shook me to the core that life can just change on a dime. What sadness to know that you are not going to remember your family or your life at some point. I cannot even imagine but Ms. Genova wrote with such passion for the family and the subject. I found myself in tears throughout the book and to me, that shows what a wonderful writer she is if she can make me care that much for someone.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|When I first saw this movie back in 1977 it was great.  I bought the normal DVD version a few years ago and it was not pleased with the audio but this Blu-ray version brought me back to 1977.
031606792X|2.0|I was so disappointed in this finale of a series that I really enjoyed. It was like she threw all the outcomes that could maybe happen into a hat and then pulled them out willy-nilly. The writing was so trite. I was expecting a big confrontation with all the build-up and then, nothing. It fizzled out. What a shame that this book could not leave me wanting more like the others.
B00000I8UF|2.0|This album is a 5 star classic, but unfortunately, extremely poor mastering significantly detracts from the enjoyment it can bring the listener. Except for the two Monk titles, the RVG Edition series is a seriously flawed collection of historic jazz, especially the first batch that came out in '99, and this is one of those. They sound bottled up, exhibit no air or ambiance, and they possess a hard glare. The glare is generally missing after \\"99, but the other issues are still present.<br /><br />Another flaw in this series is that many of the titles are in mono when excellent stereo masters exist. Rudy Van Gelder recorded exclusively in mono prior to March '57, and stereo exclusively after October 30 1958. He only recorded in both formats during the time spanning those two dates. While some will rightfully argue that the mono master sounds best in some instances, the RVG series has many titles in it that were recorded after Oct. 30 1958 that are mono. No mono masters exist for these sessions, so these CD's are simply the stereo master folded down into one channel. What's the purpose of that?<br /><br />Relief is Available: Most of the RVG Edition titles are available in an earlier US version and as a Japanese import here on Amazon. These sound dramatically better and give you a sense of stage depth and air around the instruments. They are also stereo when possible, and appropriate, and they lack the glare of the RVG Edition. Everything I've purchased that was released before 1999 in the US has been good, and all of the Japanese versions have been good. The imports are very pricey so you might want to get the older US versions through the Amazon Marketplace. I've purchased many of these for under $10 in \\"Like New\\" condition. To avoid problems, I recommend only dealing with sellers who have a positive rating of 98% or better. They don't generally misrepresent the condition, and they'll usually get it to you within 4 business days.

B0000009TT|5.0|The whole debacle FZ had in the 1970's and 1980's with Warner Brothers was one more slap in the face this man suffered in the \\"Land Of Opportunity.\\" Yes, his detractors say he was \\"arrogant,\\" \\"bitter,\\" \\"spiteful,\\" and so on, and this criticism isn't without merit, but Warners really made life miserable for him at the time. If anything, he suffered from his own Type A personality. He delivered an eight-sided box set to the record company to fulfill his contract, and they wouldn't release it, and they wouldn't let him release it elsewhere. Mercury Records printed 300 copies of it before Warners halted the process, saying they had the material in their own vault. They wouldn't pay him, they wouldn't release him from his contract, and they wouldn't release the record, citing it as \\"objectionable.\\"  The law suit over this, and all his master tapes, from \\"Freak Out,\\" with the Mothers Of Invention up through \\"Zoot Allures,\\" went on for years, costing HUGE amounts of money and dissolving business relationships as well.<br /><br />But \\"Lather\\" (or \\"Leather,\\" depending) is one of those gems  that nobody thought would ever see a proper release. It was played once in its entirety on a Los Angeles radio station (before the days of the snotty, wussy, fascist FCC's retarded tactics), and only existed as a bootleg, until the folks at UMRK unearthed it, and gave it its due. And despite some minor changes, it's all here, for all to experience the way it was meant to be.<br /><br />The bulk of this material is available on other releases, ones Warners put out without Zappa's authorization to make some money from \\"product,\\" but in 1996, it finally saw the light of day. He has written and arranged such a staggering breadth of material, in so many styles and formats, it can be endlessly rearranged, and somehow come off as fresh.<br /><br />Recorded between 1972 and 1976, it contains tastes of the jazz era of The Mothers, with George Duke and Ruth Underwood, orchestras, small rock combos, and early versions of some of the tracks which were reworked on \\"Sheik Yerbouti.\\"<br /><br />The only thing I wouldn't have done on this was use the bonus materials, as used here. They are little gems from the vault, previously unavailable, but they have no place in the continuity of this particular issue. Even though they are at the end of it all, they still disrupt the idea of the original program. A good idea would be to make a back-up copy, and simply not put this stuff on.

B001UOVP1S|1.0|I understand the intent of trying to mesh Chris Cornell with a modern, smooth feel.  However, that intent fell less than flat here.  The cheese factor of the synthesizers can only appeal to an audience that is willing to suspend disbelief far longer than I.  I only made it through the first three tracks before giving up completely.  Musically completely uninteresting, lacking in depth, lacking in originality, and uninspiring.  Has anyone found themselves humming the background music?  The only comparison would be the abssymal backup band for Amy Winehouse.      Unlike Amy Winehouse, though, Chris Cornell's voice is completely at odds with the musical style in question.  For years associated with ripping, testosterone-filled, screaming spears of sound, this attempt to subdue him just enough to make him fit into some sort of club-like/lounge scene is as absurd as trying to turn a Ferrari into a T-bucket hot rod.  Yes, it can be done, but WHY?  It'll NEVER be done right!  Proof positive is this album.    Sorry, Chris.  This one I've already deleted in its entirety.  Can't risk having it pop up on Shuffle mode and spoiling my workout.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is to the point a great gps device.  I use it with my EeePC running Ubuntu.  The unit gets a lock in just a few seconds.  The magnet with rubber pad works great on many surfaces.  Worth every penny.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have now purchased this set for various friends and family. I found it to be informative but mostly I enjoyed the English language spoken as it was meant to be.....Excellent acting very believable characterization.  I highly recommend this DVD for your family enjoyment!
B001PPGAIA|3.0|I'd say this one is 3 1/2 stars.  Go in with low expectations and you're likely to enjoy it.  Go in with high expectations and you're likely to get annoyed with certain aspects of the story.    Basic Plot: A woman (Kidman) goes to Australia to meet up with her husband but discovers he's dead.  To save the farm she must drive the herd of cattle to market, and for this she enlists the help of the Drover (Jackman).    The Good:  The cinematography is excellent, treating you to some tremendous vistas of the Australian outback.  And, in general, the performances from Jackman and Brandon Walters (the boy) are enjoyable.  There are several comedic moments along the way, and good use is made of Aboriginal lore.  All in all the movie rolls right along despite it's three hour girth (though I confess I did watch over the course of two nights).    The Bad:  Kidman's performance is stiff and her chemistry with Jackman is marginal at best.  This isn't helped by those ridiculous new lips Kidman is sporting that look like a couple of greasy Kielbasas.  The storyline is contrived in places and and you can't help but wonder if the director was trying to write two stories.  The result is a jolting transition after the cattle drive that dumps you unceremoniously into part two of the story.    Bottom Line: Australia isn't as good as Oprah would have you think or as bad as some critics make it out to be.  It's not exactly epic but the benefits outweigh the flaws.
B001ED7C58|5.0|All the songs are great,overall, its a great cd to listen to no matter what you are doing. As I'm listening, I'm actually replaying each scene in my mind.
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|This movie was made by Baz Luhrman (I know I massacred the spelling of his name and I'm sorry) the same guy who brought us Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge. If you've seen any of those other movies you should know what to expect from this one. Look at the cover/poster. It looks like the cover of a cheesy romance novel, that's exactly what it is. It's not just that though, it was a better Pearl Harbor movie than Pearl Harbor was, it's a fun cattle drive movie, and it's really funny in parts. I really enjoyed this movie and so did my wife.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|soundgarden were amazing. temple of the dog were amazing. 'euphoria morning' was amazing. 'scream' is a travesty. i guess that's what happens when you go from working with the likes of alain johannes and natasha schneider to working with timbaland. don't get me wrong. i appreciate timbaland's production prowess but i'm trying hard to get an angle on the artistic intention with 'scream'. 'euphoria morning' was profound, artistic, and pioneering. 'scream' makes me want to scream as loud as i can to drown out the dumbed-down lyrics and trite compositions. spare me.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Every track 1-12 is amazing on this cd which you will wanna hear over over again
B001LPWGE6|4.0|This is a fantastic box trilogy. The picture quality is exceptional. It improves from \\"The Bourne Identity\\" to \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", with Ultimatum having the best sound/picture of the three.
B000VXJYFI|4.0|Get it while it's hot. These \\"Capitol Vaults\\" reissues are a clear money-grab, especially the Radiohead LPs, but that being said, they are really nice. If you like rock music, you should probably own this document of Hendrix live at his peak. And it's on red vinyl (or at least mine is). 'Nuff said.
B001QB9H10|3.0|Basically, if you've seen the first 2 transporters, then you should know what to expect from this film. Alot of high octane actions scenes with Frank fighting 10 men with his shirt off, while doing it without breaking a sweat. Of course you also get your fair share of car chase scences, and not to mention, over-the-top circumstances.<br /><br />As the title mentions, the only really big down fall for this film is the the woman casted to play opposite of Frank. I don't get this? Aren't the casting directors supposed to be looking for someone that is camera friendly? I mean no disrespect to the young lady, but I seriously couldn't stand looking at her! And she was always yapping on and on about being hungry and talking about food.<br /><br />Besides that casting disaster, Jason fell back into the role of Frank very decently this time around, but I personally feel that neither sequels can amount to the original. I can watch the first Transporter over and over without getting tired of it, but part 2 wasn't great, and now part 3 falls into the same catagory as the first sequel. This movie is still worth watching, but I don't think I will make a full price purchase of it anytime soon
B001GMH8SI|5.0|...is, above all else, its HONESTY. It avoids all traps of smarmy sentiment, favoring instead an honest explication of the life of a young man with much childhood baggage who set out as honestly as possible and with the highest integrity to understand and deal with this baggage. All the while, the film lets nature be its own force and shows that human decisions - both good and bad - have consequences.  \\"Fate\\" and divine intervention are scrupulously, blissfully absent in this film.     To me there is nothing whatsoever tragic about McCandless' life. To the contrary, he had a full, rich life of his own choosing. He knew what he wanted and pursued it. The fact that a suburban kid ill-prepared for wilderness living made stupid mistakes despite his best efforts to prepare in no way diminishes his accomplishments or makes his life a tragedy. We are made out of meat; whatever happens to meat happens to us. C'est la vie, literally. The lifespan of any us is an absurdly brief flashbulb pop whether that life be 20 years or 80. A human lifetime is like the universe itself; no matter how \\"big\\" or \\"small,\\" it is always all there is; self-contained. Every lifetime is complete, whatever its circumstances or duration. And especially, IMHO, when a life has been as full, rich, honest and INTENTIONAL as that of Christopher McCandless. What an inspirational life and what a GROWN UP, thoughtful movie. Maximum kudos to Christopher McCandless and to brilliant Sean Penn.
B000002UAU|5.0|This has got to be , IMHO, the best album ever recorded by anyone at anytime anywhere. No other single album has touched the musical landscape for the better as this one. This album was world changing. All others bow to the REAL music masters, The Beatles!
B000JBWWRY|2.0|I love Disney movies and I remember loving this movie as a kid, but OMG the portrayal of Native Americans is so blatantly racist as to be simply stunning. There is NO way I'd let my kids watch this film. It is fine for adults I suppose who can approach the racism of this film with some sort of historical eye/filter.    Don't think it's racist? Go onto a reservation tomorrow and yell \\"redskins\\" in a crowded room. Yeah, I didn't think so.
0545128285|4.0|i like the paper quality and print quality.<br />good design. this book is not only interesting to read it's nice to hold it in hands as well.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|i put this in the player and had to take it out to make sure it was this cd. Holy lord, this is bad. I kept thinking, \\"why would any record company greenlight Chris Cornell with 4:4 beats\\"? Then I saw who the producer was.<br />I have always considered myself a kind of \\"student\\" of music productions, from the lowest of lo-fi to the slickest of overproductions.I don't get everyone worshiping Timbaland. He had some good moments on the Justin Timberlake disc, but has had many misfires since then. Add this to the list. Sorry Chris. I admire the risk, but hate the results.
0937381888|5.0|Just before I started brewing a few months ago I read John Palmer's \\"How to Brew\\" website, which is an older version of the book online and is free.  It was very helpful in getting me started in this great hobby.  I've brewed a few batches and decided to buy the updated book.  I'm glad I did.  The book has a ton of great information, several recipes and goes a little bit into how to brew your own styles.  It has great info on hops, yeast, bottling, kegging and just about everything else.  If you are already brewing and you don't have this, you should get it.  If you are thinking about getting started, I would recommend checking out his website first and then buy the book after you brew your first batch.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|This was one worth buying on Blu-Ray. Good quality Thrilling Action and never looses it's entertainment factor. I know the public can't replace all old DVD'S with Blu-Ray's but some movies are classics and will improve your video library.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|Now I haven't seen The Wrestler personally but I am a fan of professional wrestling and I know for a fact that Mickey Rourke utilized the professional wrestling world to not only make sure that his character was as authentic as he could make it but he also gave some up and coming wrestling superstars both of the WWE and TNA their first role in a film.  The two wrestlers that I am talking about are Ron \\"The Truth\\" Killings of WWE, and \\"Black Machismo\\" Jay Lethal of TNA.  Mickey also got training and advice from some of the legends of the business.  People like Ric Flair, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka, and \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper.  It has also helped with a storyline on WWE Raw which involves Chris Jericho being angry with Mickey Rourke for starring in The Wreslter and causing a backlash of all of the \\"old timers\\" wanting to come back to the spotlight for their \\"last shot at glory\\".  So I am definitely going to see this film and from what I have heard and seen I am sure I won't be let down.  Also look for Mickey Rourke at Wrestlemania 25.  He is going to be there to \\"deal\\" with Chris Jericho and his abuse of the wrestling legends.
B001F12J0C|5.0|i bought this for my husband for valentines day! He loves it! I like it too, because the DVD cases are thin so it's not bulky like three dvd cases. Great movies too!
076790592X|4.0|Very few books have the ability provoke emotions from cynical readers such as myself, but Tuesdays with Morrie has managed to do just that. Tears flowed freely and I couldn't tear myself away from finishing it to the end. It is beautifully written and is a testament to the powerful influence of good Educators who are enthusiastic about the education they have been entrusted to instill in their students. This is a beautiful book to read no matter your situation. If you've never known death or if you have too often dealt with it in the past, this book is a must read.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|\\"Dreams From My Father\\" chronicles Barack Obama's inspiring journey of self-discovery culminating in a life-changing journey to Kenya, the country of his Father's birth. As he meets the African side of his family and hears their stories he comes to a greater understanding of the complicated person his Father was, and the ghosts that haunted him. He also explores the meaning of this heritage in his own life. Along the way, he offers keen insights into race relations in this country. This book was written with such depth, intelligence, and compassion that you will find yourself saying \\"This man should be President\\" and then you realize, oh yeah...he is :)<br /><br />I had intentionally stayed away from Obama's other book \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" because I'm generally wary of books written when someone is emerging on the national political stage. Since it was written in 1995, well before he began running for political office, \\"Dreams From My Father\\" offers the reader a unique window into the character of Barack Obama the man, not the politician.<br /><br />A must-read for anyone who's interested in politics, current events, Africa, or race relations.
0930289234|2.0|Seriously, the storyline is really cliche and nothing special. The glowing blue smurf known as Dr. Manhattan is cool, but invincibility is never as appealing as imperfections. Heroes such as Naruto and Batman are way better because they're humans; they're examples of what the human spirit can accomplish. I doubt most of us would be willing to walk around completely naked, have our humanity basically wiped, and get blasted with toxic chemicals.
031606792X|5.0|This was an amazing book. It absolutely tied all loose ends together, and continued the saga of Edward and Bella. I feel it also left an opening to take the saga to the next level with new characters, as well as including the existing ones. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly!!!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights\\") has created a grim, powerful masterpiece of a film with \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"  I'm not sure when I'll want to watch it again - it may be years - but eventually I will dive back in to this stark portrayal of one man's drive for the American Dream.    Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview and gives one of his trademark pitch-perfect, scary performances.  Plainview is essentially an ogre, desperate to sate his own appetites and more than willing to crush any mere human who crosses his path.      Indeed, we first see Plainview hacking out a living in a silver mine, living in solitary desolation almost like a fabled monster in a cave.  Plainview's the kind of guy who considers a shattered leg worthy of a grunt or two, but not a real impediment to success - we see this in some brutal early scenes.    But eventually Plainview becomes an oilman, willing to risk it all to find Wealth in the ground.  And why?  So he can get enough money so he can avoid human contact of any kind, a la Howard Hughes.    This is a strange, powerful film.  A harsh soundtrack, a bleak landscape, and a cast filled with strong men playing for keeps in an unforgiving world combine to make this a chilling, riveting masterpiece. \\"I drink your milkshake!\\" is destined to go down as one of the great catch-phrases of cinema, perhaps the ultimate bit of trash-talk.    Look for powerful performances throughout the film, although to be fair women don't get much chance to shine here.  Lewis is stellar, as always, but Paul Dano (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") really surprises as the twin boys Paul and Eli Sunday - the latter gets one of the most bizarre and horrifying story arcs in recent memory.  I'm not sure how many times these two actors shot the controversial final scene, but I hope for their sakes they filmed the rehearsal.    A great, powerful, jarring film.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The PS3 controller is almost, in every way similar to the PS2 and PS. I owned a Xbox 360 and would argue with my best friend(who owned both consoles and preferred PS3) over how the 360 controller felt better. When I got my PS3 I immediately tried to find something to criticize about the controller and its design. I couldn't. The L/R analog sticks are much much more comfortable than the 360's and the smaller design actually makes it seem to have a better feel. It comes pre-installed with a rechargeable battery(which can't be taken out) and lasts far longer and will even inform you that the battery power is running low and the controller needs to be charged. This controller lets me enjoy the PS3 to its full potential on every game I play.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|The CD/movie has a fabulous assortment of music, from piano bar to French humorist styles.  The CD is an eclectic assortment though.  So, if you like piano jazz and music of old like El Mundo, I believe you will like this CD.    If you are a person that likes mainstream music this CD is not for you.  The CD is purely for the piano bar aficionados.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I think this entire cd perfectly captures the mood of the increadible, epic love story that is Edward and Bella. It's weird, but this soundtrack has a supernatural vibe that I love! I'm addicted to all things Twilight and this is another wonderful way to induge in my obsession. Personal favorites are \\"I Caught Myself\\" and \\"Tremble for my Beloved\\"    I only hope the music for all the sequels is just as evocative and amazing!
B001FBSMF8|2.0|SCREAM certainly isn't the first time a rocker has been produced by an r&b/hip hop producer.  After all, David Bowie's LET'S DANCE album was produced by r&b/disco producer Nile Rodgers.  However, Rodgers brought something new to the table while simultaneously letting Bowie be himself.  Thus artist and producer brought out the best in each other.<br /><br />Instead of following the lead of the successful Bowie/Rodgers teamup, hip-hop producer Timbaland takes Chris Cornell's talents and bathes them in Justin Timberlake-lite arrangements.  The songs are certainly interesting.  But Timbaland's ego will not let Cornell's talents shine through.  Well at least there's not any guest rappers on this one.
B000VAPZM2|1.0|WHAT! AGAIN! YOU MEAN THERE'S A SEQUEL! Well of course there is. Everyone knows that Disney's gonna milk this for all its worth as long as uncultured kids and their parents (cause they're the ones with the money) will buy into it. So what can I say that I haven't already said about the first? Well this superfluous sequel is obviously a rehash of the first only set at the end of the school year and at a country club. There's just too much similarity between the basketball song and dance of the first and the baseball song and dance of this one. And like someone else said, when were dance and baseball the same? I don't care if Gene Kelly incorporated sports moves in his choreography, in the big scheme of things, they don't mix (and for not being able to dance, the \\"ethnic\\" jock sure can dance [if that's what you want to call it]). And now that I've moved on to the songs; well, what can I say but UTTER RUBISH! Again they are uncatchy and really make no sense in the sequence of things other than to shoehorn in another (badly performed) song and (poorly choreographed) dance. The big brassy opener is a poor attempt to \\"get back in\\" to the picture. The one performed by the rich girl and her brother could've been explained in actual dialogue. And the spontaneity of when they actually do sing seems robotic. Did any of these \\"actors\\" have the balls (dance numbers aside) to perform live? The overacting (and the horrible choreography) on Efron's part during his, I guess you would call it a lament (when he dances idoitically around the golf course), makes it seem like he's a raving lunatic (and people said Meryl Streep overacted and looked ridiculous when she was singing The Winner Takes It All). And while I'm on the Mamma Mia! note; Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing? Are you joking? Has anybody heard these tone deaf peons? The only reason they sound good is through the magic of editing. If you watch the making of features of Mamma Mia and see some of Brosnan's recordings, he actually does sound as he does on the film/soundtrack. People may not think I'm being fair because I like Brosnan, Streep and Mamma Mia altogether but I know good acting and singing when I see it and HSM (1, 2 or3) definately, not in a million years or til the end of days, is it. At least when he sang, he did it with emotion. And I'm gonna stop there for the songs because they're the sung the same and over acted. Again, character development would be welcome but the two main leads stay the same (they break up about mid-way but get back together anyway), the white jock's sidekick remains the same and the mean girl remains, well, mean, rude and obnoxious (except at the end to sing the big finale number but only to return to her nasty ways in the third film). And the acting! This just has Oscar worthy written all over it!

People may not think I'm being fair because I like Brosnan, Streep and Mamma Mia altogether but I know good acting and singing when I see it and HSM (1, 2 or3) definately, not in a million years or til the end of days, is it. At least when he sang, he did it with emotion. And I'm gonna stop there for the songs because they're the sung the same and over acted. Again, character development would be welcome but the two main leads stay the same (they break up about mid-way but get back together anyway), the white jock's sidekick remains the same and the mean girl remains, well, mean, rude and obnoxious (except at the end to sing the big finale number but only to return to her nasty ways in the third film). And the acting! This just has Oscar worthy written all over it!

0307346617|5.0|Phenomenal!  One of the best books I've ever read, across all genres.  Yes, it's a zombie novel, yes it's gory in parts, but it's so unlke any other monster story I've read.  It has such a heart.  Parts of it moved me so deeply, I cried.  Imagine a post-war memoir written from the POV of the people who lived it...military and civilian alike.  Imagine the horrors of war and survival they would describe.  Imagine the hardships, heartache, and even the small joys they might reflect upon when remembering the global devistation of a world-wide crisis.  How people panicked, retaliated, then also banded together to fight.  Now...allow yourself to imagine the crisis they are reliving in the telling resulted from a zombie plague.  A seemingly unreal idea written so realistically it was easy for me to buy into and live along with the story-tellers.      When I first discovered Max  Brooks, it was by thumbing through his book \\"The Zombie Survivial Guide\\" which I also enjoyed, but mostly because I found it humorous to see a whole book written like a field guide to surviving a zombie attack or invasion as if it were real.  It made me chuckle and I thought \\"How clever!\\"  But then I saw \\"World War Z\\", read the jacket, and couldn't wait to read the book, intrigued by the premise.  I was not disappointed whatsoever!  I can't say enough good about it.  If you enjoy Zombie/Monster genre novels, military drama, or accounts of human survival against great odds, I hope that you check out this book.  If you're not used to reading monster novels, I hope that you can allow your imagination to stretch enough and get lost in this great human story of disbelief, panic, failure, triumph, and struggle.  Great stuff!
B00007EDY5|4.0|Wow, I didn't expect this product to be soooo small!  ha, guess I didn't notice it is only about 1\\" x 1\\"...that's funny.  Well, I still have a Nikon D100 and, yes, it's outdated and old but it's still such a good camera and I'd hate to spend thousands of $$$'s on another one right now. This camera is NOT for portrait photography that is for sure.  :-( But this little adapter, at least, helps get my new strobelite kit attached to it okay...BUT remember that the Nikon D100 cannot do a reading/metering with this on!  ha...this is just tooo much fun!  Still trying to figure out my Sekonic meter to help me - hopefully that'll be the trick to attempting to use the D100 for portrait photography.  We'll see... wish me luck...and good luck to anyone else out there not willing, YET, to spend tons and tons of $$ on a new camera that is actually MADE for what this little adapter is attempting to provide.  ;-)
B001VL536I|5.0|The eighth season has been as interesting and entertaining as all the rest of the Smallville seasons.  I hope when the show comes to a conclusion that they take it to the big screen with a major movie.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|I was a huge fan of Soundgarden. Huge fan of Audioslave also. 'Seasons' is one of my all time favorite songs (singles soundtrack). If you're looking for something like what you've always heard, don't buy it. If you're looking for Chris Cornell, the musical innovator, then buy. The lyrics are great, and it couldn't have been mixed by anyone better (Timbaland). Much love and respect to Chris. I bet the next one will be his best. He continues to top himself. You can't stop a great artist, especially on that's about innovation like Chris Cornell.
0375826726|5.0|Personally i think this is a great book. I dont see why everyone hates this book.It was only slow paced at some places, but i thought it moved fast
B001GKJ2DE|2.0|Dumb.  Lack of decent plot.  The main actor was annoying the whole film, I was hoping he'd get assassinated...and Angelina's acting ability was lost on this part.  I was very dissapointed.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Some one`s gotta say it, it may as well be me. This \\"movie\\" is nothing but exploitation filth and i can`t believe all these people giving it 4 and 5 stars, and claiming that it`s \\"art\\" and \\"powerful.\\" I suppose you think child snuff films are \\"art\\" and \\"powerul\\" too? This movie was made just for the rich perverted filmakers kicks to get off on, nothing else. And all you people who like this movie have, deep down inside, got some weird perversion that gets you off. That`s the only reason why you like it. The film and entertainment industry is controlled by very rich and perverted powerful people who can get away with making films/filth like this. Unfortunately, the sad thing is, this film is based on true stories. Yes, rich powerful people in very high up places are involved in these sort of things in real life. Whether nazis did it during world war 2 is debateable but this sort of thing has been going on for generations. World leaders, British royalty and government agents have been experimenting with the brain and using mind control to create assassins, sex slaves and puppet polititians. If you look into a thing called trauma based mind control you`ll see that the CIA, mossad and the KGB have constantly been doing this horrible thing to many young people. What they do is traumatise someone constantly through violence and/or sexual abuse, this then causes the brain to constantly shut out the trauma, thus creating different compartments in the brain and thus creating different pesonalities in the person. Each person`s personality, or subconscious mind, can then be programed to carry out whatever the programmer wants them to do. Yes this sort of thing goes on constantly and it`s people in the highest positions of power in the world who are involved in it. You`ll find that George Bush snr was head of the CIA. He`d know all about this horrible thing. Thousands of children dissappear without a trace every year in the USA and they`re never seen or heard of again. The only\\"good\\" thing about this film and why i`m giving this film one star is because at least it`s exposing something that is really going on in real life amongst the rich and powerful elite, and it must be stopped because it`s crimes against humanity.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Like most people, I feel these just complete the design. They really feel like they're firearm triggers, like that it is their reason for being there. The only thing I can think that would make them better is if they narrowed the tip to make them better represent the actual trigger design of a real gun.    5/5

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille was a wonderful movie! It surprised me with its complexities  of the wonderful perspective of a rat's life and world. Even though the film is digitally animated it looks like it is being filmed with a camera. What a wonderful imaginative story with memorable characters! Ratatouille left me hungry for more! :)    One of Pixar's best!
B0012CJQY6|1.0|so this is by far my favorite television series to date and I highly recomend it to anyone.  With that being said I was very excited after ordering the first six seasons while deployed to come home and enjoy the show with m wife.  unfortunately for us disc three of season one simply didnt work, Maybe I got the one bad apple in the bunch who knows, but maybe you should also consider looking around a bit before settling on this particular purchase.
B001HBX91S|3.0|An appealing, tantalizing (that's the idea) collection of balletic and operatic chestuts, as professionally performed and smartly filmed as one might dare hope for.  BUT--there's a major caveat.  Many of the selections are awkwardly terminated at mid-chorus--in a couple of instances, simply a \\"fade-out\\" rather than anything resembling a cadence or final chord.  Whether a sampler such as this is more irritating than titillating to the neophyte Blu-Ray discoverer is perhaps a tough, highly personal call (reminds me of the first \\"stereophonic\\" recordings, with canons coming from two channels during the \\"1812 Overture\\" followed by ping-pong balls bouncing from one side of the room to the other and a parade of drummers soon to follow).<br /><br />What irks me is that, despite the 13 excerpts, there's space for much more on the DVD, whether in the form of complete selections (preferably) or more of same.  Although these are not the international stars whose artistry and charisma enabled them to cross genre boundaries (a la Domingo and Pavarotti), each is good enough to make you wonder why the artist in question isn't a household word.  Perhaps the most absorbing, thoroughly delightful performance is the Cecilia & Bryn duet \\"Pa-pa-pa-pa\\" from Mozart's \\"Die Zauberflote.\\"  There's only one other performer who strikes me as capable of equaling the performance included here: Danny Kaye.  (On the other hand, I defy Cecilia and/or Bryn to match Kaye on Cole Porter's \\"Let's Not Talk About Love\\" which, as performed by Kaye, is practically a toccata tour de force beyond the reach of anything human.)<br /><br />All the same, a collection such as this should be going for no more than five bucks.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is the best war movie ever made. It is extremely accurate and the only way it could have been more so is by making a film that was five or six hours long as that's how long it would have taken to develop all the characters. It does a tremendous job showing how awful wars can be and yet how much honor there is in those that fight them. This is a movie that truly captures America's best doing what they have to when push comes to shove. You may not agree with America getting involved around the world in other country's business but once committed you have to agree that we bring the best there is to bear on whatever problem it is we've chosen to address. The Clinton Administration may have failed in Somalia however Task Force Ranger didn't, this movie shows that. Congratulations to the writers, directors, actors and support crews for telling the story true and doing right by those who paid the ultimate price and those they served with in a struggle to bring hope to a corner of the world that has seen nothing but suffering. Maybe someday we can go back and finish what they started if for no other reason than to pay tribute to their sacrifice.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This Alfred Hitchcock film is a definite classic.<br /><br />It features Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) as a victim of mistaken identity.  He is thought to be a spy and has several 'bad guys' trying to kill him.  When Thornhill starts his day, he is just a regular businessman.  Before long, his world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall who is Thornhill's love interest.  She also wears some other hats in this movie.  I will forego mentioning more about her to avoid any spoilers.<br /><br />The action ranges from the United Nations building in Manhattan to the top of Mt. Rushmore as well as several others in between.<br /><br />There are several twists and turns throughout.  This is a very good show that is well worth watching.
0930289234|5.0|This is a great graphic novel to just pick up and enjoy. The characters are complex and keep you changing your mind if you like them or hate them. it is such a difference from the standard superhero comics and its nice to see that difference. The timeline jumps back and forth but is not too difficult to follow and we learn a lot about the characters through flashbacks/memories. The plot, though not too complicated, keeps you guessing until the end. This graphic novel keeps you entertained and really reveals the dark side of \\"superheros.\\"<br /><br />More at: [[[...]
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I have purchased several of these for our office.  Managers really like them as it allows you to push your flat screen out of the way when you are conducting meetings or interviews.    The only thing you need to watch is to make sure the arm is \\"tight\\" so your flat screen doesn't fall and hit your desk.  You could really damage your screen if it fell on a hard surface.  This is the best price I have found to date also.  Great product and I would recommend highly.
B000J3SITS|5.0|A sweet, melancholy yet refreshing book based on aging and death and the rich lessons learned by a young man from his mentor. A great read!
0143038583|5.0|Best, most illuminating book I've read in 10 years. Will change forever the the lack of effort in deciding your eating habits. It has no agenda save to educate the public as to the effects of their heretofore unconscious food decisions. A book that creates a life changing inflection point.    Tom Goggin
B001KYJA6K|1.0|Do not buy this cd if you value your privacy. It comes unannounced with a piece of software called Opendisc.  This Opendisc appears to be some sort of open software project and is probably benign. However, the software autoruns  itself, does various things offensive to Comodo firewall (not unusual) and then elicits various personal information to allow you to establish a link to an artist site on the internet.  Inoffensive to many, I suppose, but anybody who recalls the Sony debacle with a rootkit will probably resent the invasiveness and concealment involved. (C*ware is a term used to describe all the unwanted software c* that comes on a new computer.)
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I would highly recommend these for anyone who isn't quite satisfied with the ps3 controllers R2 and L2 buttons. These help making the R2-L2 buttons much easier to use. They snap on very easily, and so far after many hours of play, they have NOT come off even once. A fairly inexpensive alternative to buying a third party controller.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|WARNING! SPOILERS, please do not read further if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.     This movie is HALF-RIGHT because of the reasons listed below.     THE GOOD     - The plot is ORIGINAL. I've never seen a movie where a girl of 12 years old was a vampire. She killed and sucked the blood out of people.     - The movie brings up a social dilemma. That is if a child of 12 years committed a murder, should he/she be tried as an adult or a juvenile? What makes some people angry is juvenile punishment is like a slap on the wrist.     - The acting of the actress who portrays Eli is fascinating. She makes me keep watching and watching.     - There are some very bloody scenes that will keep gore fans happy.     THE BAD     - The pace is slow compared to Hollywood movies.     - The main actor who portrays Oskar does not show emotion on his face.     - There's no suspense. Curiosity is what made me watching this till the end, not suspense.     - There's one scene which is very disturbing. In my opinion, it borders child pornography. That is the scene where Eli visited Oskar in his apartment. Oskar had her changed in to one of his mother's dresses. Then he accidentally saw her private part. Why did the director have to include that scene? It does not have anything to do with the plot at all.    Overall, it's absolutely worth watching.

Although it is very different frm the movie, I consider it to be just as good as the movie. The debut novel from Vikas Sawarup, there are a few typos and punctuation errors but other than that, this is a great book!<br /><br />In Mumbai, Ram Mohammad Thomas is a young orphan who is 18 and has answered all answered correctly on an Indian game show named \\"Who Will Win a Billion?\\" (similar to the show \\"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire\\"). He is accused of cheating, and is tortured. He is later interrogated by Smita, a lovely young lady who asks him how he knows what he knew, and we learn how he knew it through his experiences as a young man. This includes his live with a Priest, living with a friend of his named Salim, working as a servant to a rich Australian family, Falling in love with a young prostitute named Nita, living with a faded and depressed actress who is obsessed with young age, and much more.<br /><br />This book is definitely NOT for everyone. The actress bit is quite depressing, and some parts are pretty disturbing. But this book had me wanting to know what was going to happen next, making it a page turner. Definitely a \\"can't put it down\\" read, and certainly a great book. If you liked the movie, give this one a try! I personally liked it just as much as the movie.
B001FB55YE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Audio and video are great. The story is great and the characters in this film are very fun to watch. For me, this movie is right up there with Layer Cake. RocknRolla, Layer Cake, Long Good Friday, Bank Job and Snatch now comprise my top 5 English underworld movies of all time.
B001QB9H1K|2.0|TRANSPORTER 3<br /><br />** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 26th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 104-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen<br /><br />Director- Oliver Megaton<br /><br />Starring- Jason Statham, Natalya Rudakova, Robert Knepper and Francois Berleand as Inspector Tarconi<br /><br />The Transporter series is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today, but I must confess I did enjoy the first two parts. The first was mindless fun that makes for a fun viewing. The 2nd was also mindless fun and while the action was a bit too over the top it was still a lot of fun. But Transporter 3 was rather lousy in my opinion and it was mindless, but there was no fun to be found.<br /><br />Since the Michael Bay era started action movies have been on the decline and we really haven't had any new action stars to arrive either. The days of Bronson, McQueen, Eastwood, Russell, Arnold and Stallone are gone and while Li & Chan are still good their American movies are rather weak and the newer action stars to arrive are far inferior to those I listed. But Jason Statham on the other hand has the potential to be in the same league as those guys.<br /><br />Statham has the tough guy persona down pat and has the cool factor going for him. He actually reminds me a little bit of Steve McQueen and again I think Statham can be the next Iconic action star, but he really needs to find a new agent. Even though I did enjoy the first two Transporter films they will by no means go down in the action genre. Transporter 3 puts a serious dent in the career of Jason Statham.<br /><br />The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was rather horrible; we don't go into movies like this for their deep and complex plots, but even by popcorn movie standards this script is a wreck. The plot is weak and by the time anything is explained I highly doubt anyone will still care. This is the kind of movie you watch and when it's over you'll be hard pressed to remember a single detail since everything is so forgettable. None of the characters have any depth or anything interesting to do; like I said even by popcorn movie standards this script is still terrible.<br /><br />Director Oliver Megaton fails at brining much to the table granted the script didn't give him a whole lot to work with, but even with that said there's no sense of pacing and the action scenes are quite lackluster. A lot of people complained that the action scenes in Transporter 2 were far too over the top and I'd have to agree. I've seen movies with over the top action scenes, but yet you can suspend your disbelief. Look at some of the movies out of Hong Kong for instance, but yet you can buy into it; But sometimes you can't and that was the problem with Transporter 2, but they were still fun.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same here. The problem wasn't the action scenes were too over the top the problem was they were boring and lifeless. There is also long stretches with any action, which is when things get boring since the weak plot cannot carry the movie, but when the action scenes do start you won't care since they are so weak. Oliver Megaton manages to deliver some decent action scenes in the final act, but even than they still fall a bit flat.<br /><br />Statham does his best with what very little he's given to work with, but even he can't help this sinking ship. Natalya Rudakova makes her screen debut as Valentina and like Statham does her best, but again nothing could save this movie.<br /><br />Like I said the Transporter flicks are everything wrong with Hollywood, but yet they are still fun, but Transporter 3 falls flat on pretty much every aspect and ends up a total bore.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release the transfer is one of the best I've seen too bad it's wasted on this.

B001FB55YE|4.0|Guy Ritchie makes films for guys about guys, and frankly \\"my son\\", this one is loving it...<br /><br />I say this because there's appalling film critic snobbery surrounding Ritchie and I for one can't stand it. Ok, so \\"RocknRolla\\" is not Shakespeare - nor David Lean - so what! When you sit down to it, you do so with a grin on your puss the size of Britain's National Debt. Why - because you just know you're going to spend the next two hours giggling and grimacing (for all the wrong reasons of course) and you're going to be rightly and royally entertained. And bluntly how many British film directors-cum-writers are 'this' good - can entertain you 'this' much? In an industry that seems to have lost the knack of actually turning us on, on the strength of \\"RocknRolla\\", I for one will be looking out for the Blu Ray box of Guy Ritchie films and not yet another version of Bourne or Aliens (good as they may be).<br /><br />The story is layered and smart; the dialogue is either crude or ballbreakingly funny - or frequently both - and the casting is varied and immaculate - all of them clearly enjoying themselves. The songs are apt and used sparingly and there's an already classic one-liner that had many of our customers in the shop laugh out loud when we played the CD the other day (dialogue inbetween the music tracks).<br /><br />The good news for fans is that the BLU RAY version of \\"RocknRolla\\" is beautifully filmed and I think actually suits Ritchie's film style to a tee - it makes the sharp suits and the London locations shine more. Actor wise - \\"RocknRolla\\" is crammed full of great cameos and has a lot of classy leading double acts. Tom Wilkinson is the bigwig old-school London criminal Lenny Cole with Mark Strong as Archie his sidekick. Both are typically outstanding. Gerard Butler as One Two and Idris Elba as Mumbles (the drug dealer Stringer Bell in The Wire) play their counterparts - the likely lads who get caught up in deals way over their small-time heads. Jimi Mistry is a corrupt London councillor, Jeremy Piven and Ludacris as producers and nightclub owners who can't control Toby Kebbell as the drugged up rock star Johhny Quid (feigning death to up his sales). The girls are all molls, there's the unkillable Russians, the thieving philosophizing junkies, ticket-touting gangsters covered in Bling living in Range Rovers and yobs who talk about art, culture and the beauty of cigarettes as they whack a difficult bouncer over the head with a bin lid...luverly!<br /><br />I'll freely admit that as a dabbler in screenplays myself, I sat there with a huge streak of jealousy running through me, because there's truly fantastic writing and skill on show here. One example is the scene where Gerard Butler is sat at a dinner table in a posh London restaurant with the corporate lawyer totty that is Thandie Newton. Butler's character clearly fancies her, but suspects she's just 'too' dangerous and out of his league. Slipping the bulging loot bag he's delivering under the table towards her long and unfeasibly delicious legs, he relays how the swag was attained...with a \\"bit of bother\\". It then cuts back to the actual robbery - which of course goes horribly wrong - and then just gets progressively worse - not too clever types doing not too clever things. From this hilarious flashback, the movie keeps flicking forward again to their sexually loaded conversation - and back again to more carnage with an escalating pumping soundtrack. It's kind of Ritchie's trademark style, but it's so damn good that you don't even notice how cleverly its been worked out and edited together. It's slick stuff and impressively so.<br /><br />The movie is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a damn good watch and more importantly - wildly entertaining. And come the sly and clever ending, you're left wanting more - and there's even a hint of a sequel in the closing credits.<br /><br />In the London vernacular - \\"RocknRolla\\" is a blinding bit offun - and on Blu Ray it looks and sounds like the dog's bollox. Highly recommended and a job well done.e the dog's bollox. Highly recommended and a job well done.

Butler's character clearly fancies her, but suspects she's just 'too' dangerous and out of his league. Slipping the bulging loot bag he's delivering under the table towards her long and unfeasibly delicious legs, he relays how the swag was attained...with a \\"bit of bother\\". It then cuts back to the actual robbery - which of course goes horribly wrong - and then just gets progressively worse - not too clever types doing not too clever things. From this hilarious flashback, the movie keeps flicking forward again to their sexually loaded conversation - and back again to more carnage with an escalating pumping soundtrack. It's kind of Ritchie's trademark style, but it's so damn good that you don't even notice how cleverly its been worked out and edited together. It's slick stuff and impressively so.<br /><br />The movie is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a damn good watch and more importantly - wildly entertaining. And come the sly and clever ending, you're left wanting more - and there's even a hint of a sequel in the closing credits.<br /><br />In the vernacular - \\"RocknRolla\\" is a blinding bit of fun and on Blu Ray looks and sounds like the absolute business. Highly recommended and a job well done.ute business. Highly recommended and a job well done.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I`d heard that the new Indiana Jones movie was getting mixed reviews but its 76% on rottentomatoes is a very respectable score. The Crystal Skull is the second highest grossing movie of 2008 and it reunites the talents of Lucas, Spielberg and Ford. I mean really... how bad could the movie be? To put it bluntly it is awful. I'm talking Star Wars episode I, II and III type awful. So what went wrong? Did anything go right?<br /><br />Harrison Ford has always been a very subdued actor but in this film he's nearly comatose. He looks every bit of 65 which adds to the hilarity when his shadow covered stuntman takes over and Indy is suddenly bounding around as sprightly as a young man. Early on in the film we are treated to the now infamous `Nuke the Fridge' scene where Indiana Jones protects himself from a nuclear blast by hiding in a common refrigerator. The blast blows Jones a country mile but no harm is done and this sets the tone for rest of the film. Apparently Spielberg and Lucas have zero respect for the intelligence of the audience as Indiana Jones and everyone he is associated with are written as completely indestructible and I do mean that literally.<br /><br />Remember Marion Ravenwood from Raiders of the Lost Ark? Well she's back after a 27 year absence from the series. Remember how Marion and Indy used to bicker back in Raiders? They're at it again except now they're a bickering OLD couple. Oh, and they have a 19 year old son named Mutt, played by Transformers actor Shia LeBouf. Mutt is a chip off the old block in that he's rebellious, foolhardy and entirely undamagable. My theory is that Indiana actually realizes that he is a character in a movie and thus cannot be killed. During one of the movies extended chase scenes Mutt. Indy and Marion are fighting like crazy against some heavily armed Nazi's errr.. I mean Russians. Anyway, despite the fact that Mutt is sword fighting like a highly trained professional on top of a moving vehicle that's being driven through a jungle Indy scolds him for NOT leaping into a truck filled with Russians firing automatic weapons. As if to say, `Look, I'm the main character in an action film and cannot be hurt' Indy leaps into the truck and punches out eight or so soldiers. Mutt, who was standing on a cars roof ends up getting entangled in a low hanging vine leaving him separated from the action. Suddenly a fear crept over me. Surely they wouldn't have Mutt swing on vines to catch the cars. I vowed that if Mutt began to swing from vine to vine I would shut the movie off. The movie called my bluff, Mutt swung like Tarzan and the child inside of me died just a little.<br /><br />At this point the movie just went all out taunting me. Marion drives the car/boat thing with Indy and crew straight at a sheer cliff launching it through the air with reckless abandon. Rather than plummet to their deaths the group gently lands on a massive branch that carefully lowers them into the river below as if all of reality were conspiring to protect them. Marion has a smug look as if it was all planned but how is that possible? How could she have possibly seen the branch or known that she was driving a magical vehicle that would drop perfectly horizontal as in a cartoon instead of heavy end down as in reality? As if things couldn't get worse Lucas pummels the audiences intelligence with one of the most mind bogglingly stupid scenes in the history of movies as Indy and crew are dropped off not one, not two but THREE massive waterfalls leaving them completely unscathed even though the last gigantic waterfall flipped them all out of their vehicle. Marion laughs after the third drop as if she's flipped her lid but I think she was laughing because it finally occurred to her that as a main character she couldn't be hurt.<br /><br />This is not a mediocre movie it is a terrible movie. I watched all three original films in the theater and this one is a travesty and an embarrassment to their memory. Did I mention thatIndy is hunting for aliens in this movie? There is nothing redeeming or worthwhile in the film. It is worse than Congo. It is worse than Battlefield Earth. Well, ok. It's not THAT bad but it's pretty bad. This is the kind of movie that causes me to lose all faith in the taste of reviewers. Despite the high gross this movie is actually garnering some of the worst reviews I've ever seen from non professional reviewers so I have to give the audience some credit. I've already lost any faith in Lucas but shame on Spielberg. Shame on everyone for tarnishing a legendary film series.Indy is hunting for aliens in this movie?

0439023483|5.0|Each district in the country of Panem must offer two tributes -sacrifices- to the annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a nationally televised fight to the death, starting with 24 tributes and ending with one living survivor, the \\"winner.\\" Tributes are selected in a lottery (a nod to Shirley Jackson) and when her beloved younger sister Prim has her name selected, teenage Katniss volunteers herself. This sacrifice comes as no surprise, since Kat has been hunting and foraging illegally in the woods to feed the whole family since the death of their father and their mother's subsequent breakdown.<br /><br />Kat's other tribute is Peeta, a boy who once saved her life. Kat knows there can only be one winner, and she enters the Hunger Games hoping she won't be the one to end Peeta's life. As a strategy, she and Peeta create a romance, which rallies support for this team from a poverty-stricken district. As the game progresses, so does the romance. How real can it be, if one of them must die?<br /><br />Cold, ruthless and fiercely loyal, Kat remains a sympathetic character despite her social naivety. Violent but not gruesome, The Hunger Games offers readers a glimpse into a life run by the producers of Survivor, the Olympic Games Committee and Soviet Russia.<br /><br />This fast-paced young adult novel grabs the reader and won't let go. A few plot twists are predictable - but delicious, and the Gamemakers often push the plot  forward by altering the Game.  And the ending? Perfect.

B00000ING2|5.0|It is a shame that tightly envisioned, edited, unique, totally enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end, but generally unknown to the masses, \\"Hollywood\\" films like this, are so rare and special, and seemingly come along so infrequently.  But this is surely one of them.<br /><br />The Coen Brothers (Ethan and Joel) have been writing, directing, and producing movies for some time, and are still at it, and while countless fans have their particular favorites among many of the brothers' efforts (including \\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" \\"Fargo,\\" and \\"Burn After Reading,\\" etc.), this effort remains my personal favorite of theirs, and may always be so.<br /><br />While this returned little real box-office popularity/profit or awards during first release or afterwards, it remains my most cherished Coen Brother's film and one of my all-time great movies in particular.  For it blends hokey and comically noirish, but thoroughly wonderful, old-time movie genre elements and characters brilliantly with non-obtrusive but totally effective camera techniques, and does so in a way that few, if any other attempts at the same, have ever come close to.<br /><br />Mixing various cinematic forms and styles, this harkens back to earlier, similar movies, but with a much sharper wit and wisdom, and an insider, knowing wink of an eye, imparted upon nearly every scene and shot.  And while other films which have dealt with the same general ideas, are many and noteworthy, this one remains special.  Strangely enough, the film's general political/social views, continue to be relevant to this day, if in a more serious mode in real-life as compared to this broad, fictional satire.<br /><br />Generally, the movie deals with hapless, harmless, good-intentioned but naive and innocent everyman \\"Norville Barnes\\" (Tim Robbins) and how he rises from bottom to top to bottom to top in the crazy world of corporate politics.  This at times seems a re-working of \\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\" but on weird steroids, albeit with a lot of relaxing, enlightening, insightful and eventually hilarious deep puffs on a chill pipe to even things out.  The end results are simply genius, shot to shot, scene to scene, with little if no filler at all.  In fact, few films I've ever seen, are as truly \\"tight\\" as this, among all genres.  There are really no wasted shots or scenes, and the film moves along towards its end much quicker than the appreciative viewer wants it to, all of which only adds to the absolute enjoyment.<br /><br />Norville rises to the head cheese of the company/corporation he is hired by within a fluke, with many flukes, twists and turns to follow, only to see it all crash down upon him at one point.  But his initial, humble employment (and \\"idea\\" - for kids, you know), is only the beginning of many rises and falls within the corporate environment of \\"Hudsucker,\\" a Wall-Street behemoth of the late 50's, whose fortunes rise and fall many times within the same movie.  If there ever was a film which still, many years later, directly relates to generally true themes from times of yore, to present day (and the seeming bizarre if not comedic economic troubles from today's headlines), it is this.  In fact, as time passes, this movie becomes ever more relevant, and while most of it is done in exaggerated, almost cartoonish styles, the Coen's inimitable touches of basic \\"common knowledge\\" truths beneath the whole are always very present.<br /><br />Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh are fantastic in supporting roles, the former as the truly \\"bad guy\\" corporate swine on auto-pilot, and the latter as a totally delightful, dead-on, old movie, fast-talking and cynical Katherine Hepburn-ish newspaper reporter.  Leigh's persona is that of a materialistic, opportunistic, fast talking \\"career-gal,\\" but which hides an eventually revealed heart of gold and love for Norville, the wet-behind-the-ears \\"schmoe\\" who she initially sets out to destroy tofurther her own aspirations.<br /><br />There are so many twists and turns and exquisitely detailed moments within this one movie, that I think almost any review does the film injustice, which makes me almost hesitant to try.  But if you are at all a fan of older but truly inventive and original movies, especially the frenetic black and white \\"screwball comedies\\" of days gone by, and have a general insight into the way mega-corporations really work (as I think I do), I promise you will love this and find much value in nearly every scene and shot.  And find new pleasures in every repeated viewing (as I do).<br /><br />This is the Coen Brother's finest release, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering their historic and growing, substantial body of work.  There are so many great, timeless themes here which are generally relevant and entertaining, that it's hard for me to imagine any general movie buff/fan who will not eat this up as filmic candy, if they have not already done so.  There are also many other minor roles and characters, played by some familiar faces, which only add to the experience of watching this true masterpiece, and at times, the non-comedic elements (the drama and the romance) fill and enhance any possible gaps.<br /><br />This is a first class winner, with a really wonderful musical score to boot, and from beginning to end, has definitely earned its way onto my short list of DVD's to own someday.  It is a work which is filled from start to finish with enchanting. mirthful but moving, meticulously edited curious joys, one after another, and continuously compelling twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />This movie is essentially, \\"you know, for kids...,\\" my personally most memorable quote (and idea) from the film.  In other words, this nonstop, entertaining romp is for decent, unselfish, idealistic, romantic kids of all ages, not yet spoiled or corrupted by the Ayn-Randish, pessimistic, immoral nightmare which corporate, capitalist Wall-Street America has been for far too long.  And which sadly, according to the headlines these days, apparently still is.<br /><br />A film I cannot recommend highly enough...many twists and turns and exquisitely detailed moments within this one movie, that I think almost any review does the film injustice, which makes me almost hesitant to try.

B001FBSMF8|2.0|Having been a CC fan since the late 80s, this record left me feeling like most of the other people reviewing this record. What the heck has happened to CC? While I appreciate Chris's willingness to expand his musical horizons, his collaboration with Timberlake is a bad choice. Cornell's amazing voice and musical sensibility is drowning into a sea of drum machines and repetitive rhythm patterns that ultimately take him nowhere. If he was looking for drum machines, maybe he should have worked with Trent Reznor.   Surprisingly the best track on the record is the bonus track at the end of song #12. Maybe he just managed to squeeze this one by the `producer' while he was sleeping. It a bluesy slow song that allows Chris to display his musical talent. It almost sounds like it could have fit on \\"Euphoria Morning\\" back in 99.    Regardless, CHRIS...PLEASE START MAKING MUSIC AGAIN SOON OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR AUDIENCE.
B00005JPY2|3.0|3.5 Stars          Watchmen is an entertaining adaptation of it's source material, but there are a few problems. Instead of nit-picking about the minor flaws I would like to address one fundamental flaw. The film fails to adequately express the subversive riptide that underscores the original comics narrative. The subversion is, that either/or, left/right, us/them, reptile brain linear thinking is an apocalyptic dead end. even Adrian Viedt the \\"smartest man in the world\\" succumbs to this fallacy and creates another false dichotomy. It's a brilliant piece of dramatic irony to have the one character that is the most slavishly devoted to this narrow minded linear thinking Rorschach expose Adrian's latest iteration.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It started out different than I had expected compared to the other Elizabeth Gaskell films that BBC has put out. I also own Wives & Daughters and North & South. I LOVE them both and was expecting Cranford to be somewhat the same. What I realized is that Cranford is character driven while the other two are more plot driven. The first hour was a little slow but it got more and more entertaining as I went and by the time it was over I had laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Now I think I will go back and watch it again and I am sure the first hour will be even more interesting to me. Judi Dench was amazing in this film. She played such a simple women and she did it powerfully. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys clean well made period films.

I absolutley love this cd- I wonder how incredible it would be as a SACD seeing how it already is one of the most enveloping musical expeeriances- like being in an ocean of sound.

0380715430|4.0|Bill Bryson's \\"The Mother Tongue\\" is a delightful read suitable for any language enthusiast. While several readers have singled out the (apparently copious) errors in the book, I myself read it for its entertainment value only, and was not troubled by these technicalities. Though by no means a scholarly text, Bryson's book provides readers with a wealth of information and trivia; in less than 250 pages he touches on everything from dialects to dictionaries, crosswords to curse words. Each of the sixteen chapters is closely focused on a subject related to the use, history, or development of the English language (both in England and other English-speaking countries), and can be read (and judged) on its own merits. Likely written in the late 1980s, and published in 1990, some of Bryson's \\"modern\\" examples are a bit dated. However, most of his illustrations are historical in nature, which will allow several generations of readers to follow along with the same level of comprehension. Who knew that a book on spelling and grammar could be so entertaining?

1416594884|3.0|I have been a Le Carre afficionado for decades, I eagerly anticipating the release of his next book.  Not only were his stories captivating, but his writing was wonderful--a pleasure to read.  That was then.  I wish he had stopped writing before Constant Gardener.  This latest novel is far too contrived, nearly formulaic.  The characters lack the depth of his earlier writing, with the possible exception of the three core characters; the writing itself lacks lustre.  And he seems angry--at what?  Religion?  Terrorism?  The spy world--or the new spy world post Cold War?  In the end, this book is ordinary.  It's just another hop-on to the world's (understandable) preoccupation with Muslim extremism.  Sad.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|I don't want to repeat all the good reviews, because they are all true and this is a singularly great series and blah blah.     What I wasn't expecting from Mad Men was a meditation on existentialism and how close America flirted with nothingness while \\"having it all\\". Everyone in the series does what they think they should do, play the roles they think they should play with glee, all while being worried sick that underneath there is pain, unhappiness and baseness, and not much else.     \\"The universe is indifferent\\", Don Draper says at one point, coalescing the characters' reaction to the void. Fill it up with instinctive desires and lust for dominance and power and get away with as much as you can. Meanwhile, they live with and romance complete strangers, and immerse themselves in their pre-cut roles while trying to avoid the unseen force that drives their behavior. When calamity strikes these souls, granite shells are exploded and inside there are often scared little children who are ill-equipped to deal with real life and real emotions that they are secretly victims of.    Mad Men shows people doing what's expected of them without bothering to do what they are supposed to do-on Madison Avenue, near the heights of success, as the opening of each episode shows, it's a long way down to the annihilation of everything they are, and a long time to think about it in descent.

Menzies visited 120 countries and over 900 museums and libraries in the course of his research, and has assembled a surprisingly persuasive account that suggests how China's foothold in the American continents could have been established, then lost due to the turmoil following the Emperor's fall.

B001MYIXAW|4.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray watched on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35 Player. The picture and sound are adequate, with a bit of noise in some scenes, but overall, very sharp and clear. If you're a fan of the film, the purchase is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I am a fan of \\"different\\" takes on the same story,and tend to gravitate towards slower-paced,thought provoking films. However, though I thought this film was an interesting departure from the typical vampire flick, I found the film did not provide enough detail for me, and the pace was a bit too slow. The angst of the bullied Oscar, and Eli, who is obviously tortured by her \\"prison\\" of needing blood and being isolated are effective in creating a child-based vampire film, but I felt at the end, that it would have been helpful if there was a bit more background in the special features (only contains some posters, a brief commentary).<br /><br />Though I like open ended films, and don't long for a \\"spoon-fed\\" story, this one was a bit bare boned for me. The end scene, of Oscar tapping on the box was heart breaking and predicted, perhaps, a lifetime of sadness, longing and an eventual need to turn himself, as he'd become old, and lose Eli eventually. I also liked the fact that there was not a sexual component within the vampir myth, as the main characters are children. It allowed the film maker to create a violent, yet touching journey, withou the complications of sexual undertones, which often dilute the strength and need of real character development.<br /><br />I initially attempted to watch the English dubbed version (I was not sure if the film just starred Swedish actors, who spoke English, or if it was in Swedish-I didn't want to spoil my perception of the film, by reading ANY details). But I decided to watch the film in its native language,with English subs-the dubbing, as in most dubbed films, that I've watched is hideous and comical.<br /><br />I was going to give this a 3/5, as I did not enjoy the lack of detail, and had a few minor issues with the picture and sound. However, for its originality, and courage to tackle the vampire myth through a child's eyes, I decided to give it a 4/5. Definitely worth a look-this is a story of unconditional acceptance, as the sad reality of these two characters is still based on a 12-year old's innocent perception of the world.nor issues with the picture and sound.

B0000AUHQF|5.0|This wonderful movie tells a true story, that will touch your heart! I loved it! It is about a little boy who dreamed of becoming a football player for Notre-Dame. The little boy(Rudy) grew up to be a young man, with the same driven desire to be a football player for Notre-Dame.<br /><br /> His father, and brothers all worked for the steel mill, and after high school graduation, Rudy (Sean Astin), and his best friend, ended up working at the steel mill too. After a fatal accident at the steel mill, Rudy changed forever, and with all the odds against him, and with everyone constantly telling him that he had no chance of ever playing football for Notre-Dame. Rudy left home to chase after his life long dream.<br /><br /> My favorite scene in the movie is where the football players of Notre-Dame honored Rudy, by carrying him off the field on their shoulders after a game, as I watched this, tears of joy rolled down my face! Awesome! I highly recommend this movie! But movie people, next time, please, please, no \\"GD\\" cuss words! I though Sean Astin as a actor, was outstanding!<br /><br /> I also loved the way Rudy's college friend, acted when that pretty blond came up to their table to ask Rudy's friend, to go with her friend to the dance, that was priceless, he did some great acting, Wow! And I so loved that black man, who worked as a janitor, who took Rudy under his wing,that man was great, he is a Awesome actor also!
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Truely amazing!!! I've honestly been on the outside of my many friends' addictions and many a family addiction in my short life. To me, as like many of people I presume, drugs and alcohol seemed like GIANT party that I just wasn't invited to. So, for 23 years I stood on the outside and watched as one life turned into 10 turned into 15 that I watched grow potential and crash with a bottle or a needle or rolled up dollar bills. And all I did was wonder why I had wanted to be such a part it all.     Anyway, this book did for me what I had prodded my best friend and my sister and countless others couldn't do. It showed my why I had people around me begging for the next hit to kill them. For girls to get pregnant so they had a reason to live without it. It opened my eyes to what I had been saying \\"no\\" too for lack of a reason other than I just didn't want to.    Thank you Nikki and thank you to anyone who owns up to their demons and has the GUTS to face them down.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME!! This album changed my life after hearing it. I'm listening to \\"More Than a Feeling\\" as I'm typing this.     Brad Delp's voice is angelic, there will never be anyone quite like him. Tom Scholz is a master in the studio. The guitar solos are incredible. The keyboard adds a whole new dimension to the songs, especially in \\"Foreplay/ Long Time\\".     You MUST get Boston's entire collection of work, listen to it all in one sitting, and be prepared to be blown away and mesmerized.    If God were a band, He would be Boston.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Having a borrowed library's copy watched instead finding time for own DVD had taken a couple of years.<br /><br />A bit boring at start, this movie presents a very twisted story of sex-changing father travelling with unsuspicious son from New York to LA.<br /><br />Incorporating of not-erotic sex scenes is natural and professional, making a work watching by a general broad audience.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Clint Eastwood has created a memorable tale of the consequences of the choices we make in life. Sean Penn's Jimmy Markum is unforgettably portrayed as a man whose chickens have come home to roost when his beloved daughter goes missing. Excellent performances from Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburn, and Marcia Gay Harden. Emily Rossum is haunting as Jimmy's eldest and beloved daughter. Clint is a master story teller and this is one of the best movies that had made in the last 20 years.  Sean, and Tim both deserved their Oscars.  Laura Linney and Kevin Bacon should have been recognized for their outstanding work too.  Great movie !!! Do not miss it...
B0011Z0YFE|5.0|I wasnt a big fan of the two cd's that came out before this one. I liked alot of her stuff that she's done before in the 90's and 80's. I was sketpical about buying this,but I figured it couldn't be to bad, I heard a crap load of buzz about this cd when i actually bought it in borders. Alot of americans were skeptical as well. I listened to it,and couldn't stop listening to it. This album was really big when this came out, and really made her cool again. All the tracks are very fun to listen to, and i figured it would be hard for her to follow up to something as good(hard candy being a bad example). In fact she really should stick to this type of music in the future. Get together, Jump, I love New york, Hung Up are all execellent pop songs and have catchy hooks. The music videos,the image, the whole package was different and it made her stand out. This is propably her best album since Ray of light. If you like pop music this is a must have!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The night I watched this movie, I woke up screaming from my first nightmare in more than 20 years. As you watch the film you are aware of the beautiful camera work, the intricate story, and the very bad English voice over. But you don't think you are terrified of the 12 year old vampire girl. Later on the horror creeps into you in an almost subliminal way. Over and over you recall every ghoulish detail. Wow, I almost wish I hadn't watched this movie!
B001KR9AP8|5.0|I was a huge fan of destiny's child back in the day... and then I grew up. Haha, just kidding! Anyway, I was never a big fan of Beyonce's solo work. Irreplaceable was the only song that I really liked from her. I thought alot of her counterparts( Cassie,Ciara,Rihanna, Christina Millian) were giving her a run for her money. Well, when i heard single ladies, I was like ugh! Are you serious? But when i put my ipod on this album was simply amazing! I loved every track and she has certainly matured as an artist. I think the concept of the good vs. evil, wild vs. boring is different and hasn't been done to much in the past. Tracks that are great. Video Phone has one of the best beats I've heard in a while! Halo is a great power ballad, with awesome beats. Diva is one of my favorite songs in revent memory. And of course, If I were a boy is actaully a very good song with an intersting message! You won't be disappointed if you get this album!
038073186X|5.0|Awesome book. This was my first by Lehane and def not my last. The ending was one of the best ones i've read in a while. Although there were plenty of hints by Lehane as to how it was gonna end, I didn't think it would turn out the way it did. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a DAMN GOOD BOOK. I guarantee, you will not be disappointed. I wish I could have known about this writer a couple of years back. I would have loved to read the Mystic River, before seeing the movie. As of now I've been reading 'Darkness, Take My Hand' and it's very good so far.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Had been familiar with 'Rent' from original stage reviews but otherwise no vested interest or pre-existent motivation before renting the DVD. The talents of the performers are apparent and the drama resonates inequivocally. But for the life of me am unable to recall any of the songs except for their context. But for the musical numbers, otherwise well staged, would have awarded 'Rent' four stars.
031606792X|5.0|Wow. As much as I hated to see the series end, it was an awesome closure to it. I like the way Stephenie Meyer divided it into sections, giving each main character's point of view. It truely was an awesome book...I hope she writes more!
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|i really didn't think that i would like this cd as much as there second one beacause that one was the best. but this cd was just as good and there is one song in particular that is a duet and its my favorite
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Awesome collection for any Star Trek fan!    From this seller, there were some problems with a couple of the disks not playing, however the seller went out of his way to make everything right.  If there you buy from him and experience any issues, BE PATIENT! I definitely would purchase from this seller again in the future with confidence, because I know if there are any problems he -WILL- make them right, no matter what it takes!
0446402389|5.0|Of all the books that I read in 2008, Child 44 was the best one without a doubt. While the story line and plot are quite intriguing, I was even more mesmerized by all the other details that go into the novel portraying Russia during the Stalin era.  Smith's writing is incredible.  I loved the fact that there were several times in the book when I thought I knew \\"what was coming\\" and would be shocked by the turn in the story.    The characters are so well developed and it's easy to be pulled into their tribulations.  Once I finished the book, I found myself wanting to know more about the characters and where their lives go from there.   If you want a fast-paced, thrilling, and unpredictable read, this book is for you.    I am highly anticipating the sequel to Child 44.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|\\"Scream\\" is excellent! This is another excellent CD from Chris Cornell. All of the tracks are excellent!    Track Listing  1. Part Of Me  2. Time  3. Sweet Revenge  4. Get Up  5.

B001O8C5KK|5.0|I was deeply moved by this new recording of a perennial favorite.  I thought that Angela Georghiu's Butterfly was intense and thorough.  It's hard to believe that she has never sung this role on stage.  I loved the virile baritonal timbre of tenor Jonas Kauffmann's Pinkerton.  All the supporting singers were just right, and Antonio Pappano's sweeping symphonic reading of Puccini's score was breathtaking.  I was so happy to hear this familiar and beloved music from a new and wonderful assembly of performers.  Maybe the studio recording is not dead yet.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|this is a very good film. stephen daldry delivers a powerful drama and kate winslet and ralph fiennes give tremendous performances. the story was told in a somewhat heavy handed manner, which i did not expect, but its still effective. and whats this new trend thats emerging, showing nazis in a somewhat positive light? (Valkyrie anyone?) weird. overall, a good film worthy of the praise.
0394800192|5.0|A fun book for preschoolers.  There are many activities (ex. apples, counting) that you can launch based on this book!
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son loved this mobile.  Not only does it play nice music, but it is so neat the that the leaves fan up and down slowly while the little rainforest animals spin slowly.  So soothing....my son just loved this.  He also had the rainforest waterfall soother which he was able to use much longer (we had to take the mobile down when he started standing on his own and trying to grab the little animals), but that will happen with all mobiles.  He has also used the rainforest waterfall peek-a-boo soother from one month until present (he is currently 15 months old). I think that both crib products also compliment each other nicely.  I would not buy a mobile just because it compliments the room...most are too plain and not eye-catching enough for babies....definately highly consider buying this mobile...it has been so wonderful for my son.  It also comes with a remote so that it can be turned on and off from another room, although I don't think we ever used the remote much.

1577311523|1.0|Reading this book is worse than listening to a stoned stranger prattle aimlessly about his psych 101 class.  It's like a cult leader's manifesto, designed to demonize the ego and glorify the self, by treading back and forth across all of the most beaten paths in the history of psycho-spiritual writing.  Let me share an example here,    \\"When every cell of your body is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free of time\\"    Next, he will ask you to drink the poisoned kool-aid, so that the spaceships can take you to heaven.    If you feel your spiritual side is missing, try fishing.  Books seen on Oprah, like this one, should be your last resort.

Thanks to the sound engineering of Steve Hoffman, the Gold Disc cd's are incomparable in sound quality when measured by other Badfinger recordings.

B001GSV3EC|2.0|Let me state upfront that I am a certified, card carrying, dyed-in-the-wool Jeff Beck fan, and have been since I saw him live with the Yardbirds. Few artists of my generation have the talent of this incredible musician.    That said, I will never purchase another product from him on which any of the songs on this disc appear. \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was on \\"Truth\\", his first effort in 1967, and, like many of the others here, has reappeared again and again over the decades.     If he's ready hang up the Strat, if his well has run dry, if he wants to simply work on hot rods for the rest of his days, no one could blame him. His fan base will mourn his decision, but respect it. This fan asks that he do the same. Show us something brand new or retire.

B000TJBNFI|5.0|When people ask me what some of my favorite films are I always say \\"Misery\\" is near the top. Everything from the acting, writing, and the directing is superb. \\"Misery\\" is a perfect movie.<br /> Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, \\"Misery\\" is about a deranged woman keeping a man locked in her house against his will. Kathy Bates, who won the 1990 Oscar for Best Actress, came out of no where and made this film her own. A Broadway star with no film credits under her belt, Bates portrays one of the most disturbing and unbalanced women in the history of the cinema. Just when you think she is pleasant and kind she flips out, screaming and yelling obsenities. She plays more than just a bitch in this role; after watching her performance one observes how a person can snap and the problems of borderline personality disorder. James Caan is great as the helpless author Bates holds captive. The movie is interesting and exciting at the same time, and just when you think it can't get any better then Wham!, you are jolted out of your chair. This new DVD also comes with a wonderful documentary where Kathy Bates is interviewed and this is one of the reasons to own this Collector's Item. Rob Reiner did a fantastic job directing this thriller. Sit back and enjoy one of my top 10 favorite films of all-time. I have watched this film over and over and I never tire of it. If you also want to watch another good Kathy Bates film I would suggest \\"Dolores Clairborne\\", from another King novel.
0316143472|5.0|I have always liked David Sedaris.  Knowing what is voice sounds like (from books on tape and National Public Radio) gives his prose an added fillip, since it's nice to hear his voice in your head as you're reading.  It's not \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" that puts me in the Christmas spirit, but rather hearing \\"Santa Land Diaries.\\"  Like Garrison Kiellor, Sedaris draws you into the time and place, makes you care about the characters, and makes you laugh and look back on the stories later an smile.  After reading his latest book, I'll never look at men wearing bow ties the same way again.

The key to the 30 Day Shred isn't in the moves, but in the duration.  From the warm up to the cool down, there is NO stopping.  By the time I got to the end, my abs were aching and my legs were jelly.  But don't let that deter you from giving it a go.  Even the most devout couch potato will get the hang of it after a week or two.

B000FCK9D6|3.0|Let me start by saying that I love this novel.  A mystery fan, I am just now reading my first Agatha Christie.  The novel itself is wonderful.  The characters are vivid, the plot moves fluently, and I am completely engaged in it.  As an English teacher, however, I am very disappointed in the number of typographical errors.  By chapter 12, I have noticed at least a dozen.  My score of 3 stars is an average of 5 for the story, and 1 for quality of text.  Hopefully not all Kindle books are this poorly prepared.

B000I5X81K|4.0|Josh Groban possesses a rare vocal richness, and this CD showcases that as does all his music.  Yet this one largely lacks that \\"je ne sais quoi\\" of his first recording.  The musical genius is all there, but something of the way his music can pierce the soul is missing.<br /><br />\\"February Song\\" and \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\" touch that magic, but \\"Weeping\\" and \\"Machine\\" seem experimental misfits to this type of recording, a style that certainly Groban is capable of producing, but better on a separate release.<br /><br />Despite the lack of \\"magic,\\" Josh Groban is one of the most gifted vocalists of our time, and any recording he makes is necessarily good music.  4 stars.
0060934913|4.0|Anthony Bourdain has become the celebrated bad boy of the restaurant business, and in the process he has become a star of the Food Network, some of whose famous chefs he ridicules in this book written before said stardom. That however does not take away from the enjoyment I took from this strangely beguiling memoir. I say strangely because Bourdain is clearly an Alpha Male, who has lead a wild and crazy life, crawling up the restaurant food chain to become the Head chef at Les Halles, a celebrated NYC establishment.  This book is outrageously profane and full of sex, drugs and rock and roll.<br /><br />Having worked in the business myself for over 20 years, I can attest to the truth of many of his stories about life in the kitchen.  The story telling is gritty but also extremely funny, and inside all the machismo I think there beats the heart of a nice guy, although I'm sure he would have you believe otherwise.  The downside is you'll never eat in a restaurant without thinking about what's going on in the back of the house, and wondering what exactly went into the meal you are eating.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|In various 'professional' reviews of John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own hit play, I've read things like \\"Philip Seymour Hoffman goes toe to toe with Meryl Streep\\"..and \\"Amy Adams holds her own against Meryl Streep\\"..and \\"despite only being on the screen for 12 minutes, Viola Davis hangs with Meryl Streep.\\"  Hmmmm [scratches chin]...what do these reactions all have in common?  Only that Meryl Streep is the measuring stick against whom all others are to be judged.  I guess it's passe to say directly that Meryl Streep is extraordinary.  Instead, everyone now puts her co-stars on some type of Streep-o-meter.  Needless to say, the best performance in a Meryl Streep movie is...Meryl Streep.  That's taken for granted some times.<br /><br />The movie itself is pure dynamite.  As someone who was raised as a Catholic in the 60s and attended a Catholic high school in the 70s, this movie resonated deeply with me.  One scene that stuck out: Shanley's juxtaposition of the prim, cloistered convent with its almost mute nuns, followed immediately by nothing less than the raucous cacophony of the rectory with its hard-drinking, garrulous priests.  This scene was pure genius and no doubt left many of my fellow Catholics of a certain age thrilled with such a realistic portrayal.  I raved to my wife after the film about absolute truth of that passage.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his role here.  His character is believable as a mentor to the boys - the scene where he helps them shoot foul shots and answers some of their questions shows that mentoring side.  But Shanley's script is subtle and telling here, too, because we also get some of the character's quirkiness.  Hoffman shows the boys his clean nails and says \\"I like to keep them a little long.\\"  Just enough to make you start thinking...

B0002Y69NG|5.0|First of all, I have been a fan of the Matrix films since I saw the first Matrix in theaters. It blew me away that anyone could create an action film with such a compelling and creative story. Not only are these movies fun to watch, but they are also insanely well shot and the music and actors are brilliant in my mind.  Every disc in this set is packed full of features, ranging from the interesting commentary tracks, with one track on each film from philosophers citing how they enjoyed the films, and another track on each film from critics who did not. That is quite a gutsy thing for any filmmaker to include negative reactions to their movie right there for anyone to experience.  This collection is definitely worth paying for, even if you own the originals.
B000031WBV|3.0|Although Rubinstein's tone and articulation are exquisite, the sometimes excessive rubato and uneven tempos interfere with the natural flow of the music. Too often, he lingers over a note instead of moving on, or plays a staccato note instead of letting the sound resonate. The result can be a disjointed, halting effect that detracts from the rhythm.<br /><br />Although many people feel Rubinstein's interpretation of the Nocturnes is similar to the way Chopin played them, the fact that Chopin always kept a metronome on his piano speaks for itself. Nevertheless, Rubinstein was one of the greatest pianists the world has ever known and is always worth listening to.

Imagine my disappointment to open the deck and see what I can only describe as dull and muddy coloring. As for the artwork itself, the human-noid figures look distorted and ugly, with only the figures in the suite of Cups being at all attractive. Frustrated with the deck, I opened the book and was very glad to find it informative, well written and usable. Hence the stars on this review. If not for the book, I would have given 2 stars.

The use of the brain pal and smart blood made me laugh.<br /><br />The book is full of sex and violence. Scalzi creates interesting ways for people to die while questioning the ethics of the CDF. Great book.<br /><br />The book is great plan on taking a day off work to finish it. It hooks you!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Everyone in my family just loves this film, especially my wife and I! You would think that the lack of dialogue in the first half hour would make it hard to follow, but it is actually makes the movie more compelling. The lead characters have great depth. And the art, especially in the first half of the film, is so realistic you'll swear you are watching a live-action film.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in over a year. Francis (Owen Wilson) invites his brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schartzman) on a cross-country train trip through the heartland of India in order to reconnect, bond and find themselves on a spiritual level. That's their internal arc. The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the \\"foot of the Himalayas\\".<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape. The Darjeeling Limited (the Movie) attempts to mix farce with scenes of dramatic pathos unsuccessfully. For most of the movie, the three brothers are depicted as losers with a ton of emotional baggage, unable to resolve grudges they hold from an unfulfilled childhood. Unlike the Three Stooges (who mainly depended on quirky physical routines), there's little to distinguish the three witless Whitmans. Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 ½ months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train). Note there is a 13 minute short film on the DVD entitled \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" which illustrates the ending of Jack's pretentious novel.<br /><br />Act I concerns the brothers' unfunny vignettes aboard the Darjeeling Limited. The main bit concerns their smuggling a poisonous snake aboard the train which almost gets them thrown off by the conductor. Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an \\"Indian giver\\" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier. They get into a physical altercation which spills out into the passenger section. This finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Act II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys. The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third. The brothers are about to take a bus but are suddenly invited by the villagers to attend the boy's funeral. Obviously, this is the scene where the brothers are supposed to 'grow up' and the audience is supposed to sympathize with them. In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story). Here, the rescue of the children occurs at the midpoint of the film and it seems out of place with Act One's slapstick tone.<br /><br />Act III reunites the brothers with their mother, the nun in the convent played by Anjelica Huston. There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing. Unperturbed, the brothers go up to the mountain and bond with one another. The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.<br /><br />The performances here are uniformly forgettable. The usually grim Adrien Brody should be singled out for proving that he's unfit for comedy. The leering Jason Schwartzman does his Ron Jeremy imitation and Owen Wilson takes a pratfall or two. Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope. Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film. The true star of this misguided production was the Indian countryside and its people whose earnestness is contrasted with the shallowness of the film's creators.ct II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys.

B001PPLJIQ|2.0|'The Reader' begins in West Germany in 1958. Michael Berg hails from a grim-faced German family and is ready to sow his adolescent oats. Hanna Schmitz, former SS concentration guard now turned streetcar conductor, brings Michael back to her apartment after he's not feeling well. Hanna gives Michael a bath and before you know it she's playing sex therapist to the impressionable teenager. The affair lasts a scant month or so but on screen it feels like an interminable couple of years.<br /><br />While Hanna is tender showing Michael new sexual positions, she is unable to control those flashes of temper (foreshadowing the revelation of a very nasty past!). Michael ends up reading various classic novels he's been reading at school to Hanna and she hides a deep dark secret that she is actually illiterate! One day Michael comes over to Hanna's apartment and she's disappeared.<br /><br />Flash forward to 1966. Michael is now a law student in Heidelberg. As part of a class trip, he attends a war crimes trial and finds Hanna in the docket, accused of unimaginable horrors as a Nazi concentration camp guard. Initially, Hanna denies she's the ringleader of a group of female guards responsible for an atrocity where they prevent a group of Jewish prisoners, locked inside a burning church, from escaping. Prosecutors insist that a document ordering the atrocity is in Hanna's handwriting. Hanna won't give up her dark secret of being illiterate and falsely confesses, taking the rap for her fellow Nazis. It costs her big time: a sentence of life in prison.<br /><br />The first half of 'The Reader' is slow-moving, the erotic scenes are repetitious and there's no central antagonist unless you count what's going on in Michael's confused mind. In a slightly more interesting second half, we meet an all grown up Michael (played by a grim-faced Ralph Fiennes). He's alienated and cut off from his emotions evidenced by his inability to bond with his daughter. Obviously he is still troubled by his relationship with Hanna even after all these years.<br /><br />So Michael decides to record the famous novels he used to read to Hanna in the old days on cassette tapes. Soon, Hanna is devouring the tapes and over the years finally learns to read comparing the tape narrations to books she's taken out in the prison library. Hanna writes to Michael but he won't write back (even though he still has feelings for her the idea of writing to a convicted former SS guard is something a good German should not do).<br /><br />Finally Hanna is about to be released but she has no family to help on the outside. Will Michael come and help her get set up with her own apartment? After initially balking, Michael changes his mind and meets Hanna in the prison cafeteria where he informs her that he's taken care of the apartment. But Michael asks her in effect does she feel any remorse for her actions as a Nazi? All she can that she is happy she's learned to read. As for the atrocities--there's nothing she can do about it now. Michael isn't happy with the answer but he'll still help her. But Hanna must pay the price in terms of the audience. No remorse = the need for some kind of punishment (Nazis must be punished!) So what does she do? On the day of her release, Hanna hangs herself. But she leaves a makeshift will, donating the rest of her cash to one of the Holocaust survivors, a woman who testified against her at the trial.<br /><br />In the best scene in the movie (and most truthful) Michael visits the Holocaust survivor in the United States where he informs her of Hanna's wishes. She doesn't want Hanna's money and tells Michael if he wants drama he should go to the theater and not dwell on concentration camps where no positive life lessons can be learned. Still Michael suggests donating the money to an illiteracy campaign and the Holocaust survivor won't stand in his way.<br /><br />Flash forward to 1995. Michael has overcome his demons and he's ready to tell the whole story ofHanna to his daughter as they pass Hanna's headstone in a church cemetery.<br /><br />Although the Reader is not a very dramatic or even good movie, it still is fascinating because its main focus is on the whole issue of German guilt. The movie is based on a novel written by a German writer, Bernhard Schlink, who is grappling with years of guilt feelings over the Holocaust. He's saying in effect, 'Hey, we Germans aren't that bad. Can you forgive us?' Schlink (and the Reader's screenwriter, David Hare) present two characters that don't mince words (the aforementioned daughter of the Holocaust survivor at the end of the movie and a young law student who points out that Hanna and her co-defendants are scapegoats since there were thousands who went unpunished).<br /><br />But while Schlink can face German responsibility for the Holocaust, he can do so only up to a point. His guilt leads to such confusion that Hanna is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape (however more typically, Nazis on trial would say they were \\"only following orders\\").<br /><br />'The Reader' gives the wrong impression that Hanna was somehow not responsible for her actions--that somehow by being ignorant, deep down she wasn't a bad person. In this way Schlink and Hare sugarcoat their antagonist. The vast majority of Nazis were not illiterate, ignorant people--they knew exactly what they were doing and they, along with the German people, followed Hitler with gusto.<br /><br />The generation of post-war Germans don't have to apologize for 'the sins of their fathers' nor feel guilt. They merely have to study history with clear and detached eyes in order to make sure things like this never happen again.a church cemetery.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|When we first meet Walt Kowalski, the bigoted but lovable curmudgeon played by Clint Eastwood, he's coping with the loss of his wife of many years. During the funeral and reception at the house afterward, his sons are shown having a hard time coping with their father who doesn't have a good word to say about anybody. But soon it's clear that the film's scenarists are setting us up to view Walt as misanthropic but at the same a far better man than his offspring who are busy with their own lives and don't have their father's best interests at heart. Worse is the granddaughter, a narcissistic teenager who shows little sensitivity during a tragic time of grief (the portrait of the detached granddaughter, completely one-dimensional, is designed to contrast with the much more real and sensitive Sue, the young Hmong woman, that Walt is soon to befriend).<br /><br />Sue, played by the excellent Ahney Her, is probably the most engaging character in the film. She's the one who gets Walt to open up as she brings him over to meet her family and introduce him to the Hmong culture. Not only did I enjoy the banter between the two characters but had the distinct impression that Ms. Her was not acting--that she was simply playing herself! Every time Walt would make an ignorant, bigoted remark, she wouldn't get angry but simply contradict him and explain why he was wrong. He opens up to her precisely because of her patience and insight into both her own people and the outside American culture. She's an all-knowing guide and in a sense hearkens back to the 'wisdom' character in the Bible and other ancient writings.<br /><br />To the screenwriters' credit, gang culture is not sanitized. Not only are members of the Hmong gang shown to be what they are (vicious and aimless young people who want to make everybody else's lives miserable) but the black gang members are also shown to be equally vicious. And even better, most of the Gran Torino story is not about the gang members but the relationship between Walt and the two young Hmong people who help him to find some purpose in his life.<br /><br />As the Gran Torino story unfolds, certain things don't ring true. One thing that bothered me quite a bit was Walt's complete ignorance of who the Hmong people were. Here's a guy who presumably has been living in this neighborhood for many years, all his neighbors are Hmong people, and it's up to Sue to explain to him where the Hmong came from. Despite his prejudices, Walt is not a stupid person. He would have known the difference between the Hmong and say the Vietnamese people simply from his conversations with his friends in the neighborhood (such as his friend the barber, the construction foreman or any of his buddies at the various bars he frequents).<br /><br />Gran Torino is full of 'trash talk' mainly emanating from Walt's foul mouth. Walt and his barber friend trade occasionally amusing insults about each other's ethnic identity. Whether such conversations actually take place in real life is another issue (how a barber would actually like a customer who never tips him seems completely far-fetched).<br /><br />Most of the middle of Gran Torino concerns Walt's quest to turn Thao, Sue's brother, into a 'real man'. Thao doesn't have much of a personality like his sister and his gradual transformation from a shy, detached kid into someone who's hardworking and responsible seemed a bit too predictable. It's hard to believe that Thao is such a complete wuss that the macho pep talk from Walt's construction foreman friend will so easily turn him around.<br /><br />The film's climax is the least believable of all the scenes. We're asked first to believe that Walt would jeopardize Thao and Sue's safety by beating up one of the gang members. After all, he's the guy who later locks Thao in the basement after preventing him from impulsively taking revenge on the gang members. But earlier, Walt is the one who commits the impulsive act which leads to Sue being raped.<br /><br />Now he must undo his own mistake. In a nice twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence. Perhaps 'Dirty Harry' is maturing in his old age. Furthermore, Clint seems to be softening slightly toward the Catholic church (here he's finally willing to go to confession in contrast to his diatribe against the church's stance against mercy killings which was prominent in Eastwood's earlier film, 'Million Dollar Baby').<br /><br />Nonetheless, the filmmaker's desire to give the audience a bittersweet but upbeat ending by suggesting that the gang members will end up being prosecuted rings false. Why would the neighbors suddenly be willing to testify against the gang members when it's established early on that everyone in the neighborhood is petrified of gang retaliation? No, in real life, odds are that the witnesses wouldn't have come forward to testify against the gang members despite Walt's heroic reputation in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Gran Torino is not always honest and goes out of its way to manipulate your emotions. Nonetheless, it's deftly plotted and will keep your attention throughout. That's no small feat. For all its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing.twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is the story of William Wilberforce, a Member of Parliament chiefly responsible for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in the latter part of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. Focusing on the political struggle as opposed to the individual stories of slaves themselves, the film's creators have crafted a moving and highly entertaining story of a now mostly forgotten period in world history.<br /><br />We begin with an introduction to the 'ordinary world' of Wilberforce. Right away he's depicted as someone who is compassionate toward animals after he alights from his coach and prevents two men from beating a horse (it's one of Blake Snyder's 'Save the Cat' moments: according to screen writing guru Snyder, a good screenplay always has a moment early on where the protagonist does a good deed, creating audience sympathy). After Wilberforce arrives at his cousin's estate, he dreams of smashing glasses during a banquet held by high society people, foreshadowing his struggle with pro-slavery forces throughout the movie. We're also introduced to Barbara Spooner, the woman he eventually marries. No sparks fly between them during their first meeting and Wilberforce appears disinterested with the prospect of hooking up with her. Wilberforce is depicted as a complex character from the outset. But his moral compass is always firm (as he looks in the mirror, images of slaves in chains appear--these flashbacks to the actual scenes of slavery are never overdone).<br /><br />Before we break into Act 2 of the story, there's always some kind of 'inciting incident' or catalyst which gets the action moving. In Amazing Grace, the flashback to 15 years earlier, marking Wilberforce's early career as a politician, is the actual inciting incident. We see the extremely articulate and witty Wilberforce as a young man in Parliament, debating with conservatives over the course of the war with America. There's a great scene where the Duke of Clarence (brilliantly played by Toby Jones) shocks our modern day sensibilities with his request to \\"fetch my n-gger\\"--his black servant is brought in and offered by the Duke as a wager during a card game with Wilberforce. While Wilberforce does walk out in disgust, he doesn't hold a grudge against his fellow MP's (Members of Parliament). He realizes he needs to work with these people and movingly sings 'Amazing Grace' to show them just where his sentiments lie. Wilberforce's internal conflict is dramatized as he communes with nature on his country estate. He's conflicted about whether he should pursue a solitary spiritual life as opposed to continuing his career in politics. His servant who quotes Francis Bacon, points out that serving God and pursuing political ends in the cause of justice are not incompatible. Wilberforce's eccentric personality is also depicted: his mansion is overflowing with animals and beggars who he can't say no to--bent on obtaining a free lunch.<br /><br />We break into Act 2 when the a group of abolitionists visit Wilberforce. The key moment is when Henry Clarkson, one of the more radical abolitionists, displays the actual chains at the dinner table used by slave traders and when former slave Olaudah Equiano opens his shirt to reveal how he was branded during the time of his captivity. The first half of Act 2 of Amazing Grace involves the initial successes of the abolitionists. We skip forward to the 'present time' and a series of events unfold including Wilberforce's developing relationship with Barbara Spooner, introduction of the principal antagonist, Lord Tarleton, the defection of Charles Fox, the pro-slavery MP who joins the small group of anti-slavery MPs, and Wilberforce dramatically forcing upper crust Londoners (partying on a boat) to take in the \\"smell of death' from a slave ship docked in the Harbor. The midpoint of the story is usually a 'false victory' for the protagonist and his allies. In Amazing Grace, the abolitionists' publicity campaign isworking. Fifty thousand copies of Equiano's book have been sold in two months and Wilberforce remarks (in a voice-over), \\"our message was everywhere.\\"<br /><br />The second half of Act 2 usually leads to a temporary defeat for the protagonist. Despite collecting 390,000 signatures on a petition and presenting it to Parliament, the war with France has turned public opinion against the abolitionists. Slavery is seen as necessary to the economy and the public now believes its abolition will undermine the war effort. Prime Minister Pitt can no longer support Wilberforce given the changed political realities. The end of Act 2 usually features a 'dark moment of the soul' for the protagonist. Members of the public walk out on an anti-slavery deacon's sermon and Wilberforce has another attack of his 'colitis', symbolizing the effect of the pro-slavery forces' counterattack.<br /><br />At the beginning of Act 3, the protagonist must regroup and once again attempt to battle his opponents. Wilberforce's wedding to Barbara Spooner serves as a brief respite before he goes into battle once again. This time, the abolitionists are aided by James Stevens, a lawyer who devises a plan to seize French ships sailing under neutral American flags. Since 80% of slave ships are under the American flag, removing the protection of the neutral flags, will effectively end the slave trade. The climax occurs when Wilberforce and his allies give free racetrack tickets to MPs who aren't there for the crucial vote regarding the French ships.<br /><br />Wilberforce now returns to his 'ordinary world' which has been transformed. His life has been renewed--he's now able to cope with his crippling colitis and his wife has given him six children. Finally, he lives to see an 283 to 16 vote in Parliament abolishing slavery throughout the British empire. Amazing Grace is not only a great history lesson. The casting and performances are superb and the story is inspirational.

B0000C23DO|5.0|I've had the privelege of hearing the Dead live dozens of times. For me, any one of the live recordings, Great as they are, do not capture the thrill of hearing a given rendition for the first time. After repeated playings, the fun of hearing the tune done IN A DIFFERENT WAY (the heart of what they did) is gone. But this collection presents iconic versions (blueprints, if you will) of many of the tunes commonly played live. When I listen to these, it brings back ALL the times I heard live versions. Yes, this is a good introduction for the uninitiated, but is also, at least for this fan, a collection of seeds from which many sweet memories grow.    So for we who took a powder keg and sealed our silver mines, this is a cost effective collection. The remastering is breathtaking too, allowing one to hear these iconic tunes fine detail without having to (re)buy a bunch of CDs. For recreating the live experience, the multi-channel DVDs provide a better approximation of the experience than any of their CDs anyway.
B0002ZDVF4|3.0|When you strip 'The Bourne Supremacy\\" down to its bare essentials, basically what you have is a high-powered, well-done chase movie. For the most part, it's non-stop action--and the producers were smart to enlist Paul Greenglass as the director. Greenglass films 'Supremacy' in a documentary style, making use of hand-held camera shots in many scenes. One of my favorite scenes where you really feel the events actually could have happened is when Bourne kills a fellow CIA agent in Munich and then blows up the house where the killing took place. Not only are the sequence of events leading up to the explosion choreographed masterfully(the fight scene, the lighting of the fuse, etc.) but the aftermath is equally effective--as Bourne drives away, the police are heading in the opposite direction toward the burning house which we glimpse in the distance.<br /><br />The plot to 'Supremacy' is more convoluted than complicated. In a nutshell, a rogue CIA agent conspires with Russian criminal elements to frame Bourne for two recent murders (also involving CIA agents). After a failed assassination attempt in India, Bourne escapes and is pursued by both the CIA and the Russians. Since he has amnesia, he's trying to figure out who's hunting him and why. Bourne eventually discovers he was part of a secret project called 'Treadstone' and was involved in the murder of a well-known Russian politician and his wife. The politician was set to expose the collusion between the rogue CIA agent (Abbott, convincingly played by Brian Cox) and the Russians.<br /><br />Matt Damon who plays Bourne, has very little dialogue in this movie. Damon usually gives capable performances but with little nuance. Nonetheless, the part calls for a great deal of physical action and Damon is up to the job.

B000A1KF5Y|5.0|The original release of Robin Hardy's occult classic THE WICKER MAN was missing 11 crucial minutes. These have been restored here.<br /><br />\\"Wicker Man\\" is the type of film that will absolutely give a viewer nightmares. It concerns a police sergeant (Woodward) who responds to a missing child report on a remote Scottish island. The residents of Lord Summerisle's (Lee) quaint village uniformly deny the existence of 12-year-old Rowan Morrison (Cowper). The more Sgt. Howie investigates and bullies his way around, the weirder this tale gets.<br /><br />Clearly, these folks are pagans who practice an ancient religion based on phallic worship. Lyrics to the many lovely folk songs performed by them throughout the story are incredibly bawdy, children dance naked in public, hedges are trimmed to tumescent member perfection and there's an elaborate May Pole ceremony due to culminate in ritual sacrifice. Howie's convinced its sacrificial lamb will be the missing child. He dons a giant-headed \\"Punch\\" costume and so-disguised leads the parade, all the time watchful for Rowan's appearance.<br /><br />What awaits is the Wicker Man himself and an unforgettable ending.

B000VWYJ8G|3.0|Having just watched the Bourne Supremacy recently for a second time, I must confess that I was a bit disappointed in The Bourne Ultimatum, the third installment in the Bourne series. The Ultimatum is basically a continuation of The Supremacy. It has all the good elements of Installment #2 which include a series of memorable chase scenes. The opening chase scene where Bourne (unsuccessfully) attempts to save a British journalist from being assassinated is deftly choreographed as Bourne and his hapless charge try to escape from CIA goons and a shadowy hit-man in Waterloo station in London. The second excellent chase scene is shot in Morocco as Bourne attempts to save a CIA operative played by Julia Stiles. That scene is shot in two parts with Bourne following a CIA hit-man on a motorbike and then later on foot through the winding streets of Tangiers. The chase culminates in a violent fight to the death between Bourne and the hit-man. The final chase scene which packs punch is shot in New York City as Bourne breaks into CIA headquarters and steals incriminating documents from the safe belonging to a high level deputy chief played by David Strathairn and then eluding his pursuers by driving his car off of the roof in a parking garage (it looks like all the Bourne movies must end with the obligatory car chase).<br /><br />The plot in the Ultimatum is a bit clearer than in the Supremacy. It seems that Operation Treadstone has now been replaced by Operation Blackbriar, which basically represents an escalation and expansion of the malicious and illegal CIA program. This time the stakes have been raised: it's the CIA director and his chief Deputy themselves who have the primary responsibility for the program's operation in contrast to the lone traitor in the CIA's midst, Abbott, who committed suicide at the end of The Supremacy.<br /><br />If you feel it necessary to criticize the CIA, why not utilize a fair and balanced approach? Unfortunately, the writers of The Bourne Ultimatum stack the deck with comic book villains which suggest that the higher-ups at the CIA are all odious bad guys. Don't they do any good at all? What about the fight against international terrorism? According to the Bourne Ultimatum, the people who give the orders at the CIA have went way beyond their mandate--that the use of torture is common and is used not only on opponents but on their own agents (as evidenced by the brainwashing of David Webb--now Jason Bourne). In the comic book, black and white world of The Bourne Ultimatum, leave it to (a now redeemed) Jason Bourne along with his two leading ladies (Joan Allen and Julia Stiles) to fight the out of control CIA bad guys.<br /><br />Despite the specious subtext of The Ultimatum, with its juvenile view of the CIA and how it operates, The Bourne Ultimatium is still a slick and well choreographed action flick. If I could, I'd downgrade 'The Ultimatum' to a \\"2.5\\" as opposed to the \\"3\\" I gave to 'The Supremacy'. Let's hope that the producers decide to rehabilitate the image of the CIA somewhat in the fourth installment of Jason Bourne.

0440178002|5.0|This book is a classic, a must read.  It's layered content makes it timeless, I've re-read it 3 times now and every time I get something new out of it.

He has Dostoevsky like insights, and some scenes remind me oddly enough of Crime and Punishment.
B0018AVNKC|3.0|Coraline is a film that employs computer enhanced stop action animation. So visually it's sort of a combination of the old and the new. What's more, some theaters show it in 3-D and it was neat wearing the special glasses and occasionally being startled as images seem to be jumping out right off from the screen itself.<br /><br />Coraline, a young girl, who seems to be around eight or nine years old, has just moved into an old house with her parents, who can best be described as workaholics. While Coraline doesn't really dislike her parents, she feels a bit disconnected from them. The old house they've moved into is connected to a few other old houses which are occupied by some older neighbors who are flaming eccentrics (there's Mr. Bobinsky, a retired circus master and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, elderly and rather plump opera buffs). Also in the mix is a local kid, Wybie, who Coraline finds exceptionally annoying (mainly because he talks too much).<br /><br />Coraline is very similar to Alice in Wonderland since there is a secret portal in the house which leads to a different world--an alternate universe. Coraline follows a mouse through the portal and discovers her \\"other\\" mother and father. They look exactly the same except they have buttons for eyes. At first, Coraline is seduced by everything the new parents have to offer. She's treated to sumptuous meals and given a tour of a garden outside the house which is full of fantastic creatures which Coraline finds enchanting.<br /><br />The Coraline story loses quite a bit of energy and focus in the first hour when she enters the secret world and then goes back to her ordinary world more than once. Contrast that with a story such as the Wizard of Oz--when Dorothy enters the fantasy world of Oz , she remains there until the climax of the film. By remaining in the new extraordinary world, the protagonist now has the opportunity to be tested and go up against an evil opposing force. From the beginning of Oz, there is an arc of increasing tension which culminates in the final confrontation with the all powerful Wizard.<br /><br />In contrast, the tension in Coraline doesn't really become palpable until the second half of the film. That's when the 'other' parents suddenly become malevolent and attempt to imprison Coraline in their world for the rest of eternity. Where Dorothy has three charming sidekicks (The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion) to aid her in her battle against the wicked witch, the 'other mother' in Coraline has taken Wybie's power of speech away from him--which deprives Coraline from having a sidekick to battle the forces of evil in the other world (instead, a talking cat is substituted but we feel no emotional connection to that character). I would have liked the real Wybie to have somehow made his way through the portal and helped Coraline in her quest to escape or defeat the other mother.<br /><br />There also didn't seem to be enough of a contrast between the eccentric neighbors in the real world and the fantasy world. Mr. Bobinsky seemed to be contorting himself all over the place BEFORE Coraline finds him leading his group of dancing mice in the alternate universe. The same goes for Miss Sprink and Miss Forcible who seem equally weird in both worlds.<br /><br />In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's alienation from her family occurs after Auntie Em is unable to prevent Miss Gulch from taking Toto away from her. In contrast, the alienation between Coraline and her parents is only vaguely defined (somehow, the parents' preoccupation with their own work doesn't seem to be a strong enough reason for Coraline to be alienated from them). Somehow, there needed to be a much more compelling reason for Coraline to initially consider accepting her 'other' parents'. In other words, the stakes simply aren't high enough.<br /><br />In the end, Coraline suffers from a lack of originality. It's a story that we've seen too many times before without enough new twists. Furthermore, the characters (including Coraline) aren't CONSISTENTLY charming enough to engage us emotionally. Coraline has some great special effects and art design and I would recommend seeing it on that basis alone. But unfortunately one must also focus on the story, which clearly has not fulfilled its potential.g enough to engage us emotionally.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a delightfun movie.  A good family movie especially for those who like the Beatrix Potter stories.  Five stars.
B001P3SA94|3.0|Cadillac Records is really the story of Chess Records founded by a businessman named Leonard Chess who signed some of the biggest black entertainers in the music business during the 50s and 60s. Supposedly Chess Records came to be known as Cadillac Records due to Chess's penchant for paying his musicians with Cadillacs and not cash.<br /><br />I've read that there were quite a few liberties taken with the historical record in composing the screenplay. This is particularly true of Leonard Chess (played by a miscast Adrien Brody) who purportedly short-changed the musicians who were under contract to him (the Chess in \\"Cadillac Records\\" is more of a good-natured cheerleader who always tries to be a great friend to the musicians he hires).<br /><br />The chief flaw of Cadillac Records is that it doesn't have a central protagonist. Just as we're getting used to Muddy Waters as the main character, he's supplanted by Little Walter and Howlin Wolf. Then suddenly Chuck Berry takes the spotlight only to be replaced by Etta James. Unfortunately, the shelf life of musicians (and even big time musicians) is not very long--usually only a few years in the spotlight.<br /><br />Mos Def is excellent as a wild and creative Chuck Berry but his screen time is much too short for such a seminal figure. Each of the four main characters have one or two things that happen to them that's quite interesting. With Chuck Berry, it's the fact that he was arrested for violating the Mann Act--having sex with underage girls and traveling over interstate lines. Little Walter ends up shooting a man for simply using his name in a musical group (I couldn't understand why there was no investigation into that shooting). In addition to Muddy Water's womanizing, there's also some attention paid to his financial problems that occurred after he no longer was churning out hit records.<br /><br />While Beyonce looks real fine as Etta James, her acting is a bit over the top as she portrays the singer's descent into heroin addiction. I didn't buy Leonard Chess's flirtation with Etta James and Brody and Beyonce simply have no chemistry together.<br /><br />Cadillac Records is narrated by songwriter Willie Dixon played by Cedric the Entertainer. The film needs a narrator to compensate for the lack of a strong story arc. Nonetheless, Cadillac Records is worth seeing for the music and the recreation of a bygone era. Just don't expect any drama that will knock your socks off!uy Leonard Chess's flirtation with Etta James and Brody and Beyonce simply have no chemistry together.

B0011HF6GE|3.0|...a man who desperately needs a producer and a band, and the ability to vary and extend his singing voice.    Maybe he's trying to maintain his \\"indie cred,\\" but that, like this album, often leads to drawn out boredom with the exception of 2-3 excellent songs.    He has a great voice and is obviously a multi-track production home pro, and has the ability to write very good songs and has a mind for making good, fairly authentic/original guitar oriented music.    It would be nice if he could come out of his shell a bit and explore his music.  The fact he had to be alone to record this tells you all you need to know about someone who still seems to be insecure about his talents.  I suppose that's cute and admirable for only so long.    The first 3-4 tracks are stand outs and the CD settles into a predictably monotonous drone after that, for the most part.  I suppose it's also not the hip indie thing to do, for all those tattoo'd, bearded peers out there listening, to make lyrics intelligeable while listening for the most part.  Most of these songs are purposefully muddied up with effects, and often might as well be someone humming.  The songs themselves aren't quite strong or memorable enough to hold their own, aside from the CD's first few tracks, as I mentioned.    I like his music, but all you hear is lost potential and someone afraid to break out of the all too common singer/songwriter mumbling, strumbling, emotion clinging mold.    A CD like this for many people seems to be all you'd need of his, any more and it just gets tiring, no matter what mood you're in - maybe a great CD or MP3 shuffle rotation inclusion, it really is the only \\"singer/songwriter\\" music I can usually stand outside of Neil Young.  So I suppose that's saying something.

006135323X|4.0|This is an enjoyable introduction by one of the leading experts in the field of behavioral economics, one who's conducted many of the most well-known experiments. It covers those experiments with humor and ease. If you haven't already read overlapping books like [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge]] and Malcolm Gladwell's outstanding pop-psych trilogy, then I'd recommend this book in a heartbeat.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is nothing truly new here. It doesn't have the freshness that books like [[ASIN:0061234001 Freakonomics]] offer, because Freakonomics presented surprising research results that hadn't yet been widely dispersed beyond a small group of experts. Nor does Ariely offer any common thread beyond ways in which humans (or, at least, the Americans and Israelis who comprise most of the research subjects in the book) have a strong statistical tendency to deviate from economic rationality. That's well and good, but I'm more interested in the ways in which people are more rational than we expect. For that, see Tim Harford's excellent [[ASIN:0812977874 The Logic of Life]].
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I initially resisted Remain In Light, because of its intimidating reputation for genre-transcending weirdness. In fact, I'll be honest and say that I still think that general critical opinion overrates it (More Songs About Buildings And Food is a better album.)    But this is a no-brainer five-star album nevertheless, and I really want to emphasize that it's not just one of those albums that snooty hipsters try to convince themselves they like without actually enjoying. The appeal to me of Remain In Light is NOT its exoticism, which is indeed upfront (while also being a natural development out of songs like \\"I Zimbra\\" and \\"Cities\\" from Fear Of Music), but rather how it manages to slap crazy polyrhythms onto winkingly chintzy synthesizer loops and licks, and ties it all together with massive pop hooks to create music which is both avant-garde AND accessible at the same time.    It doesn't always succeed, but when it does, look out Cleveland. \\"Crosseyed And Painless,\\" \\"Houses In Motion,\\" and \\"Born Under Punches\\" are zany surrealistic delights (TAKE A LOOK AT THESE HANDS!), to be sure. \\"The Great Curve\\" is even more impressive, building from a brisk earth-mother fertility incantation (\\"world moves on a woman's hips\\") into a delightfully intricate three part tribal chant. (Let's just boil it down: you WILL start moving your body around if you play this song loud, even if you're sitting down.) But \\"Listening Wind\\" is irksomely flat in its pitching, and the entire premise of the album almost falls apart disastrously on \\"The Overload,\\" just when it should be building to a final triumph.    Yet it all comes together for the single greatest moment the Talking Heads ever put to vinyl, \\"Once In A Lifetime.\\" More than anything, it's this miraculous piece of genius which ultimately earns Remain In Light a space in rock Valhalla. The instantly recognizable lyrics (\\"MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?\\") are clever in their refusal to be parsed literally, but I've always imagined this song as the Talking Heads' elitist rewrite of Kafka's Metamorphosis: David Byrne awakes one morning to find, much to his horror and dismay, that he has been transformed into a perfectly ordinary guy. Lyrical concerns aside, the song has a brilliant rhythm track. Frantz is all over his kit, getting a beat that Jaki Liebzeit would tip his cap to, but notice how Tina Weymouth plays the same two bass notes the entire time, without once deviating? THAT, my friends, is fearlessly brilliant minimalism. That, along with Brian Eno's sturdy backing vocals on the chorus, help the song engage every part of your brain at once, which is why it's an instant classic. The album needs to be heard if no other reason than that.    As for this remastered version...well, the \\"dualdisc\\" is problematic without a doubt.  Rest assured, the complaints you're reading from other reviewers about its proneness to scratching are not just mere nitpicking: the fragility of these double-sided discs is only exacerbated by the digipak format of these reissues.  The 5.1 mixes are adequate, but I consider such things to be little more than gimmicks: what matters is the original CD/LP mix, and in this case it is unimpeachable.    The bonus tracks included with Remain In Light are all instrumental outtakes from the sessions, unused instrumental ideas that clearly began life as band jams rather than as pre-written pieces.  That being said, they're all rather interesting, displaying the band grooving and working out the Remain In Light concepts as a much more stripped-down four-piece unit (five with Eno?) rather than the augmented final production masters.  And the final bonus track, \\"Right Start,\\" turns out to be a lovely early proto-version of none other than...well, I'll let you discover when you listen.
B000P0J024|5.0|Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and the singer from ELO...how can you miss?  Each of the singers has two or three songs that are distinctively their own but several songs are a mix of styles that are hard to pin down.  Overall a fun mix that is truly entertaining.
B000C3H4M2|4.0|It could have been Talking Heads' best album. You have to admire the conceit, at the very least: 11 songs all about different sorts of fears, from the obvious (\\"Animals,\\" \\"Drugs,\\" \\"Life During Wartime,\\" the insanity of \\"Memories Can't Wait\\") to the metaphysical (the indelible \\"Heaven\\"), to the paranoid (\\"Cities,\\" and the hilarious \\"Air\\").    The lyrical themes are always important when considering the Talking Heads, but what makes this stand out from the rest of their albums is that several of the actual SONGS are better-written, catchier, and better-performed than any others they came up with. \\"Cities\\" (in particular the alternate version available on the new boxed set) witnesses David Byrne stretching his voice like a rubber band in the most gymnastic vocal performance he ever gave, while the deceptively relaxed ensemble playing of \\"Heaven\\" reveals layers upon layers of frustrated, achingly-calibrated tension hidden underneath the surface which only bubbles up during the last chorus (listen for Chris Frantz shouting in exasperation in the background). Plus, as an admirer of Robert Fripp, I'm naturally drawn towards his work on the opening \\"I Zimbra,\\" which steps aside from the album's themes and looks ahead to the polyrhythmic, surrealistic future of the band lurking around the corner.    But alas, Fear Of Music is also saddled with more undistinguished filler than any of the other albums from the \\"classic quartet.\\" Perhaps this is the price to pay for the new heights of melodic and conceptual inspiration on the best songs: by pouring all of their great ideas into the standout songs, they were left with some others whose main purpose is just to fill time on the album. \\"Mind,\\" \\"Paper,\\" \\"Electric Guitar,\\" all fit the theme quite well lyrically, but musically? This stuff is distinctly second rate for the Heads. (You won't find anything this indifferently unmemorable on More Songs About Buildings And Food, for example.) \\"Animals\\" boasts an intriguing 7/8 meter and some hilarious lyrics (so true, so very very true) that get it across the finish line, but \\"Drugs\\" too is a bit of a disappointing bore as the album closer. (The alternate version found on the boxed set changes my opinion of this song RADICALLY, but that's not the version we have here.)    I want qualify my criticisms by pointing out that none of the tracks I object to are BAD. You won't hear these songs and think \\"dear god they've lost the plot.\\" But you won't be blown away the way you were when you listened to \\"The Girls Want To Be With The Girls\\" seguing directly into \\"Found A Job\\" either. Buy Fear Of Music to experience its high points: you won't hear many Talking Heads songs better than \\"Air\\" or \\"Heaven\\" or \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" or \\"Cities.\\" But also understand that, taken as a whole, this is a bit of a dip in between two giant peaks in their discography.    As for this reissue, the first thing to say is that all the complaints you're hearing about the \\"Dualdisc\\" format are valid, and not overexaggerated nitpicking.  The double-sided disc is prone to scratching; there's really no safe place to put it except a CD player, and that includes its \\"proper\\" digipak holder since these sorts of cardboard packages have a nasty tendency to nick and scratch exposed disc surfaces.  Also, its thickness (due to having information encoded on both sides) means that certain older computers and CD players have trouble recognizing it.  I haven't personally experienced these problems, but you might, so here's fair warning to you.  The 5.1 mix of Fear Of Music strikes me as particularly wrongheaded (this is an album that lives and dies on the precision of its Eno-tuned balance of hazy instruments), but I consider such things to be gimmckry anyway so I'm relatively indifferent.  The remastering itself is excellent, bright without being harsh and completely faithful to the original.    The bonus tracks on this set are more than mere throwaways, by the way.  Although I'm upset that they neglected to include the glorious alternate version of \\"Drugs\\" found on the Once In A Lifetime boxed set (with Robert Fripp providing delightfully queasy guitar accompaniment), the superior alternate mix of \\"Cities,\\" complete with an extra verse, is found here.  Also, I find myself preferring the alternate mix of \\"Life During Wartime,\\" which features Fripp spraying white noise shredding throughout the song as well as a hard ending.  The previously unreleased outtake \\"Dancing For Money\\" is little more than a groove with Byrne babbling nonsense syllables over top, and the alternate of \\"Mind\\" is unpreposessing, but the other two bonus tracks are worthy additions for any serious Talking Heads fan.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let the Right One In has the trappings of some of the worst movie cliches ever; its a vampire movie, a coming-of-age story, a buddy movie- and yet it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen.     It unfolds with a quiet precision, as luminous and mesmerizing as the best of the early silent horror movies. Set in Sweden, the story follows the outcast Oskar, full of rage at the bullying of his peers, and Eli, the mysterious young girl who moves into the apartment next door. The two gradually begin to understand and love each other, accepting even the darkest and most frightening parts of the other's nature.    The violence and blood in the film is understated, in fact it gives a totally original and stunning meaning to the words \\"off-screen\\", but it is nonetheless shocking when it comes. The young actors convey a wonderful combination of solemnity and innocence, they really look and sound like children- but, all puns aside, children of the night.

Considering i'm watching a 65\\" 1080p display from only 12 feet away and can see every little imperfection. I'd say this blu-ray transfer is stunning 80% of the time. There are some scenes looking like regular dvd but mostly this blu-ray looks crystal clear. A must buy for any blu-ray enthusiast. The series' reputation among many WW2 vets speaks for itself. A good example of a safe blind-buy. The extras w/ the interviews of those veterans will make you cry. Tears are the least we can give them...
B001DEVZUG|2.0|As some have mentioned...yes the cd is great and the dvd is a bit of a let-down.  The audio quality of the videos is just basic stereo.  Not too special for a collection like this.  BUT...even worse, there is a special edition coming in a few weeks that will really please true fans.  There will be a second disc of rare or unreleased music and additional videos.       Why must companies release \\"Special Editions\\" weeks after original releases?  And AMAZON should be more responsible and informative with their consumers.  I purchased the original and expected it to be much more 'special' on its own.      [...]    This has been a lessoned learned...do not pre-order...something better may be coming soon!
0316067598|4.0|Marcus Luttrell is a bona fide national hero of the United States, and his story is a must read.  It's not so much a story of hardcore SEALs and exciting warfare tactics as it is a recounting of the tragic circumstances of duty-bound warriors in a foreign land.  Luttrell tells of the battle that took the lives of three of his closest friends, under the most trying of circumstances, right before his very eyes.    The true message I got out of this book, though, was one of a soldier bringing to light the injustices brought about by rules of engagement and international conventions that the constrain morally-bound combatant's ability to engage enemy forces unbound by such restraints.  Luttrell lashes out at a media intent on sensationalising the actions of American war fighters, he blasts the Geneva convention for leaving rule-abiding soldiers vulnerable to the unscrupulous tactices of rogue combatants, yet he also manages to shed light upon the courageous SEALs who fought an uphill battle against a band of nomad terrorists without comprimising their own, as well as their fellow countrymen's, principals.    This is a heart wrenching story that shows the many sides of the people affected by or involved in the war in Afghanistan.  From the Luttrell family's vigil for their son on their Texas ranch, to the sympathetic Afghani villiagers in the Hindu Kush mountains who housed and rehabilitated a stranger in a foreign land, Luttrell sheds light upon the countless unpredictable, yet often altruistic states of the human condition in the midst even the most horrific consequences of human interaction.    Luttrell tells a side of this war that is seldom told - the side of the American warfighter, as told by the American warfighter himself.  If you have read about this war in the news, and watched it on TV, pick up this book and read about what really went down.  Hear it from a man with first hand knowledge, who still has to watch it every night when he closes his eyes and triesto sleep.    This is a phenomenal story that should not be skipped over.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|I thought this movie was really good and had lots of action. My mom received this as a Christmas present. We finally watched it after we got our power back because of the big ice storm we had. Wesley Gibson is forced to become an assassin because of his dad. He is trained to 'curve the bullet. He has help from the sexy Angelina Jolie. A lot of the movie reminded me of my favorite game, Max Payne! If you want action, and violence, you have to be WANTED!!!
141690977X|5.0|I thought this book was entertaining, but I really couldn't believe that all these women went out of their way to make up excuses for a man treating them badly or ignoring them.   I totally agree with Greg saying that you should believe a guy when he says he does not want to be in a serious relationship. But the crazy lady who continued to sleep with a guy after he broke up with her, or the one who never went out with the guy she was (what can I say, you can't say she was dating him if they never went out!), so sad. I also loved the comments by Liz, when she examined the situation from a woman's perspective with comments \\"Here's Why This One is Hard\\".  I only disagree with a couple of points.  There is such a thing as a shy guy that might be intimidated to ask out a successful, beautiful woman.  He says never to ask a guy out, but I know if you just make it casual and not a date--it definitely works.   For example, you can say \\"A bunch of us are going to so and so for happy hour, how about meeting us there?\\" or something else like a party or barbeque as long as a group will be there.  After that, don't pursue a man and let him pursue you, but otherwise I know from experience that you will miss some great guys if you don't at least make a friendly gesture towards them initially.  A lot of the suggestions are valid and no-brainers, such as don't date married men or men who are just too \\"busy\\" to manage to call you or give you the attention you deserve.  However, we ladies sometimes do what we know isn't best for us in the long run, and I think it helps to give some concrete examples so we can see how stupid it looks on other people.  If you consistently find yourself in bad situations with men, you definitely have some deeper issues to work on that you will not find in this book.  This book is just meant to open your eyes a little in a humorous way and get you to throw him out, when in doubt.  [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]

B001FBSMF8|4.0|Once every few years an album will come out that will be universally trashed from critics and fans alike--an album that will get most people to say \\"oh my God, what the (expletive) were they/he thinking.\\" And then, inevitably, this album will start to form a cult following over the years and it will be labeled \\"ahead of its' time,\\" \\"mold breaking,\\" \\"underappreciated,\\" \\"misunderstood,\\" etc. Albums that fall into this category include the Rolling Stone's \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request,\\" (1967) John Lennon/Yoko Ono's \\"Sometime in New York City,\\" (1972) The Velvet Underground's \\"Squeeze,\\" (1973) Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music,\\" (1975) KISS's \\"Music from the Elder,\\" (1981) David Bowie's \\"Tonight,\\" (1984) Motley Crue's self-titled album, (1994) Van Halen III, (1998) and Metallic's \\"St. Anger\\" (2003).<br /><br />While I try to be open-minded and see the best in everything that an artist I like puts out, I have my limits. For example, I absolutely hate \\"Metal Machine Music\\" and \\"St. Anger\\" and despite being a huge Lennon fan, find \\"Sometime in New York City\\" to be mediocre. That said, most of the other albums I've included in the above list, I like, and will happily defend against anyone.<br /><br />Which brings us to Chris Cornell's new album \\"Scream,\\" (2009) already a legendary \\"sucky\\" album. To get a sense of how bad this album is being received, no less than Trent Reznor has stated \\"You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable? Heard Chris Cornell's record? Jesus.\\" Rolling Stone was slightly less appalled giving the album two stars, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes in his one and a half star review \\"'Scream'\\" never seems like a collaboration, it seems like it was assembled by committee, discussed in boardrooms, farmed out to contract players and stitched together on computer.\\"<br /><br />That said...I love this album...there I said it...I really love it!<br /><br />The idea of Timbaland and Chris Cornell working together on an album seems strange; and the result is what one might expect--a CD that sounds like Gnarls Barkley meets Justin Timberlake with maybe some more guitars. If that doesn't appeal to you, stay away from this CD. I can understand perfectly why people would utterly despise this album and think that Cornell has lost his mind. Certainly any \\"rocker\\" would throw this CD against the wall while listening to \\"Badmoterfinger\\" (1991) wondering what the hell went wrong.<br /><br />But I have to hand it to Cornell; the dude really put it all on the line and took some chances making an album like \\"Scream.\\" More importantly, however, the songs really work. I generally don't  like the music Timbaland produces, but I found myself totally digging this album--the hip-hop beats, the silky nature of the songs, the stellar production, the way one song glides so easily into the next; it's a totally enjoyable experience. Plus, Cornell's aloof, loner persona seems to clash with the music, but it's a contrast that is actually quite interesting.<br /><br />Personally, I found Audioslave to be a tad bit underwhelming, and I thought Chris's last album \\"Carry On\\" (2007) sucked, so I'm glad that he showed some balls and did something totally different. That said, I would be disappointed if Cornell made future albums like this, as rock is his forte. 2011, on the twentieth anniversary of \\"Badmoterfinger\\" and the grunge explosion it would be perfect for a Soundgarden reunion....<br /><br />Wondering how long it will take \\"Scream\\" to get a cult following....strange; and the result is what one might expect--a CD that sounds like Gnarls Barkley meets Justin Timberlake with maybe some more guitars.

B000W1YYSQ|2.0|Though I can't deny the talent of these guys,it's not my cup of tea.They really should have found someone other than Geddy to sing or simply not had any vocals at all.I can't get past the Alvin and the Chipmunks tonality and pitch of the vocal tracks.Very white bread and soulless,but technically proficient music.
0743270754|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a very long time.  Goodwin is able to capture the genius of Lincon - his humility coupled with his confidence.  Lincoln was not intimidated by surrounding himself with great leaders.  Instead, he was able to draw upon their expertise and get these individuals, all of whom thought they were better qualified to be president than he, to work together as a team.  Lincoln also had incredible patience and an uncanny sense of timing, knowing when to keep an individual in power and when to remove him and replace him.  His sense of humor enabled him to disarm his competitors and opponents while appealing to others.  Goodwin combines scholarship with excellent writing that makes this a truly important book, especially at the present moment as we face our own crises.  Lincon and FDR are ranked (along with Washington) at the top of the heap as far as US presidents are concerned.  Washington's situation was unique - as the first president he had no precedent to guide him and literally had to create the position.  Lincoln & FDR, on the other hand, faced serious crises - civil war, economic depression, world war - and the lessons to be learned from them are relevant to our current condition.  This work, along with Goodwin's masterful book on the Roosevelts at war - \\"No Ordinary Time\\" - are must reading to help us understand the magnitude of the issues facing the current administration.  It is also sobering to realize that despite the fact that they are now seen as being larger than life, they were often villified during their lives.  In Lincoln's case it was not just by his bitter opponents who removed the south from the union before he even took office but also many of those who supported the same causes he espoused.     I give this book the highest recommendation possible.  A must read for all serious individuals.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I have seen Pinochio only once before in my 53 years of life, and that was at an outdoor showing in a tent waaay back in 1980, on Long Island, with about 500 other people, on a 16mm projector.<br /><br />Fast foreward to March 11th, 2009, and my 26 inch LCD home theater...<br /><br />Although I'm legally blind, I still have my ears, and a very limited amount of vision in one eye, so I can see tv if I sit very close to the screen.<br /><br />It was like discovering an old, lost friend.<br /><br />The movie was as fun and scary as I remember it.<br /><br />Especially the Pleasure Island sequence.<br /><br />Yes, and I still hate the Coachman. Even though he has only a small bit of screen time, to me, he is the most vile and evil villan ever created by the Disney animators, making even the White Queen seem like a nun.<br /><br />\\" Oh, they never come back... AS BOYS!\\"<br /><br />One of the most terrifying scenes ever put on animation or live action.<br /><br />It's a pity that you never see what happens to Honest John and Kitty. They were fun villans, and I sort of hoped that they would have lived a long, ragtag life.<br /><br />Anyhow, it's a sheer joy to have this finally in my collection.
B000002MZ9|3.0|poor lyrics decent guitar work by neil    overall not a great album    by ragged glory instead
B001KYJA6K|5.0|Extraordinary! I love every second of this disk. The liberties Christina Pluhar allows when playing Monteverdi make 'Teatro d'Amore' one of the most beautiful fresh interpretations of renaissance pieces. This disk is recommended only to those music admirers that treasure and boast imagination. Hardly could be described the beauty of the interpretation as well as the good assortment of the compilation. Congratulation!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|OK, admittedly I am a Tommy Lee Jones fan but not a Fan Boy. No, this may not have been Oscar worthy but to label this movie worse than television is just plain cold and malicious.    I enjoyed the characters and the story as well as the acting. I don't think this movie was ever intended to be a great work of celluloid art but I do feel it was definitely worth my time and attention.    Chuck, ease up, it's entertainment not artistic competition. Yikes!!    If you enjoy Mr. Jones's characters from other law enforcement movies of the past you will probably like this as well. I can not speak to the integrity of the story as it relates to the author's book but it was an enjoyable movie non the less.
0618918248|5.0|When you approach a book with a title such as THE GOD DELUSION, you expect a book that primarily pokes fun at religion or the belief in a supreme being. After hearing some of Richard Dawkins lectures, I wondered why this book would be any what intellectual for being a book about making fun of religion as proof of religions lack of evidential value. I finally decided to buy and read this book through (cover to cover) after doubting my own convictions about God only because so many atheist describe it as the ATHEIST 101 guide to why people choose not to believe. Very quickly I was surprised to find that the book was actually quite good.        Knowing full well that Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist, I wasn't the least bit surprised to see several uses of Darwinian Evolution in his discussions. I was surprised that he could eloquently answer so many of my questions about the need for religion. He thoroughly (in my opinion) refutes religion on the basis of science, morals, evidence, betterment of life, guide to making people more complete, and as a forum of child abuse to indoctrinate children to have an unquestioning attitude as to their parents religious convictions. I found the book to be an easy read and quite enjoyable. Never have I given so much attention to a book in my life.        My biggest surprise was his discussion of a double blind test on the healing power of prayers. I begin to see religion as a complex forum of non-proven beliefs that thrives on people's superstitions. Shortly there after, I saw prayers and miracles being no more acquainted with a god as being the cause of good luck from a rabbit's foot. Quickly, I saw that a lot of our beliefs (or evidence for belief) is solely based on superstition accompanied by some book that we do not question.         Though, I did not fully agree that religious moderates offer a gateway for religious fanaticism, I did agree with Professor Dawkins that such unquestioning beliefs could be used by someone with evil intents to lead people into committing horrible acts that they would not normally commit. While I think someone should not become an atheist solely on this book (atheism should be a process and not an overnight decision), I do feel that Professor Dawkins invites people to reach the security that it is okay to question their own beliefs and demand proof of such religious teachings. I also feel that this is the book that acts as a beacon for those who are now atheist to not be afraid to admit that they don't need a god to be happy people and that they should be willing to admit that they do not believe in any forum of deity. In the end, I think this an atheist book that will help people to change the way they perceive atheist if they are only will to crack open the cover and read it for themselves.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I've always loved this movie, from the first time I saw it. And at the age I first watched it, I was very picky. But Tom was great in it, as well as Gary Sinise. I think Gary's part in this movie, is one of his best performances, and that's sayin a lot.    I love how Forrest never just gives up, like a lot of us would love to do in hard times. He always keeps going, the best he can, and always does his best to find the best in people. He's such a sweet guy who had a pretty hard life.     A really great movie :)!
B001ILFUDC|4.0|I forgot the last time I have seen Disney's PINOCCHIO. I think the last time I saw the classic animated film was when I was still a child. I recently had the opportunity to view Disney's platinum edition of PINOCCHIO. Because it has been such a long time since I last saw the film, I can't really compare the animation with the original version. That said, the story of the puppet coming to life and wanting to become a real boy is timeless. With the assistance of Jiminy Cricket, his conscience so to speak, Pinocchio learns the hard way right from wrong. I'll be perfectly honest, PINOCCHIO was never one of my favorite Disney films. It never struck a chord with me like BAMBI or SNOW WHITE did but at the same time I don't think it is a bad film. This just isn't my favorite Disney film. I personally thought Disney did a great job at digital restoration. The second disc consists of behind the scenes footage and deleted footage. I thought the alternative ending was quite fascinating. The younger audiences will definitely appreciate the games and activities more than adults. Overall the two disc 70th anniversary of this Disney classic is certainly one to own for families with young children.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I would normally go through the trouble of rating and reviewing each song individually, but this album isn't worth it.  Besides, there are no silences between songs, i.e. the album is meant to be one continuous play, so I think it's fair to lump the whole album together.    I had a feeling it would be \\"different\\" when I saw the producer credits, but I was hoping for the best.  Chris Cornell gets props for being experimental with this album, unlike \\"Carry On,\\" but this is just ridiculous.  At least \\"Carry On\\" was a rock album with some decent songs on it, bland overall though it was.  For rock fans, this album has no redeeming value except for its novelty among Chris's body of work, a few good lyrics, very appropriate cover photographs, and the hidden track, \\"Two Drink Minimum.\\"  For fans of electronic pop stuff, maybe it's good, but I wouldn't know.  I will admit that some of the songs are catchy in places, so if you're a pop fan, this album could appeal to you.    As a huge Soundgarden fan, a lesser fan of Temple of the Dog, Audioslave, and Chris's other solo work, this is a huge disappointment.  I really hope Chris goes back to basics, maybe experimenting a little, but not this much, if he's going to put out more albums.  Obviously, this is the twilight of his career, but I think he still has the ability to write good songs.  Here are some steps he could take to make the next album better:  1. Never use this producer again.  2. No more intentional voice distortion.  3. No more guest vocalists.  4. Definite beginnings and ends to songs are good to have.  5. Get that guitar repaired.
B000TEPKAW|5.0|Bowie has done so much great work that it would be hard to pick a single album to put at the pinnacle, but this one would be up near the top for sure.   It does have a couple of slow, brooding 'soundscape' instrumentals that are not my favorite thing on this album as they tend to drain some of the energy created by the more dynamic pieces.  But it's possible that that's just me.
0312937385|3.0|Not that it should be a surprise but despite Amazon saying this is a first edition it is in no way close to a first. It came out 20 years ago, it would be a miracle if they had a new first edition for so cheap. Great book however. I highly recommend the series.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|you have to see this to believe it honestly. fasten seat belts. the work behing this movie is a phenomenon in itself.  no one scond left. action and special effects every seconds.    this is the perfect film to demonstrate High def to yr neighbours.    i rate this an absolute 5 stars and a must own in any blu ray collection
B000JIHP88|1.0|I gave this product one-star mostly to get your attention.  This product is wonderful, but only if you modify it by taking out the large flapping leaves.<br /><br />Our first Rainforest Mobile lasted about 3 months before it stopped spinning/flapping.  The songs still played, so I knew the batteries were okay (even replaced the batteries and the status remained the same).  I called Fisher Price and had it replaced by the warranty.  Fisher Price customer service was very kind and helpful, and I received the replacement within the 6-8 weeks they said it would take.<br /><br />However, upon receiving the new mobile, I installed it with flapping leaves in place, and noticed that after only a few weeks the flapping leaves were slowing down, and mobile seemed to be struggling.<br /><br />I took out the flapping leaves, and left the smaller leaves with bird/monkey/frog intact and the mobile now runs with no problems.  We've had the newer mobile for 13 months, and have not needed to replace the batteries or call for help in all this time.  We use it daily to put our 18-month old boy to sleep at night.<br /><br />We do recommend this mobile, but only if used without the large flapping leaves that drain the motor.
1400049628|5.0|I had got this  boook before and its a great read i am ready for the zombie atack in the future
B001TODCII|3.0|This was much better than I expected it to be. Liam Neeson is a teriffic actor of that there is no doubt, but my fear was that this would just be another formula action movie, which would give the makers an excuse to have a lot of explosions and car chases.<br /><br />In fact its a decent thriller, which at around an hour and a half doesn't outstay its welcome. The first half of the movie is surprisingly well controlled, giving you a chance to both sympathise and get frustrated with Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) already difficult relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />The movie changes up a gear at the halfway point and for me this doesn't quite work. The plot gets less and less beliveable and our hero avoids thousands of rounds bullits. However, its still better than a lot of formula actions movies. This is mainly thanks to Liam Neesons fine acting (as always) and the good use of locations in France. Its always great to see a film shot outside of the U.S.<br /><br />Overall then if you suspend belief this is a fine action movie. Its not in the same class as the first Bourne film, but there are many many worse films out there.
B000CNFC76|3.0|This is based upon a true story of a poor boy living across the street from an exclusive golf course in the 1930's who caddied as a boy.  He was found to have a rare natural talent for golf when some of the local gentlemen saw his skill.  His dad was very against the pursuit of golf, thinking it to be a waste of time and that it was senseless to have dreams, but more valuable to go to work.  He ended up ultimately joining the US open tournament as winning against huge odds and very little support.<br /><br />I love movies based on true stories, and I did really like this film.  The one drawback for me, is it seemed slow paced and a sense that they had to really draw it out to make it the length of a movie.  I also didn't like that the main character didn't express what was going on with him very much, I believe that part could have been filled out more and made it more interesting.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend the movie, especially if you like golf and sporting films based on true stories.  This isn't a movie I'd probably watch a second time however.
B00027JYLC|4.0|It is hard to believe that this film was produced by THE prestige studio in Hollywood and shot on their lot, using their personnel, and their illustrious name. In 1931, MGM's head of production, Irving Thalberg, decided to take on the overwhelming success of competing studio Universal, and their success with such horror films as Dracula and Frankenstein, and create his own niche in that genre.  Drawing on a Tod Robbins novel called Spurs, screenwriter Willis Goldbeck created a world even more self-contained than that of Grand Hotel, the warped world of Freaks, the garish world of the circus sideshow, replete with bearded lady, vain acrobats, simpering pinheads, even a hermaphrodite. Thalberg's reaction to the script was: \\"Well, I asked for something horrifying.\\" The film was shot in 36 days on the Culver City lot, using the same director from Dracula, Tod Browning, with real freaks brought in to populate this bizarre world. When the freaks were given the run of the lot and the MGM commissary, even the most hardened showbiz veterans were shocked! Upon its release in 1932, the film received so much bad press and created such ill will that MGM was forced to withdraw the release from circulation and suffered a loss of approximately $164,000 in Depression-era money. This pre-Code film was a misfire in judgment for the studio, who had the film pulled from distribution for the next 17 years, when it was then picked up by an independent New York distributor for a four-wall campaign in 1949.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|Add me to the list of long-time Springsteen fans who is disappointed with Working on a Dream.  There are a few tunes here that are enjoyable and up to Bruce's usual standards, \\"My Lucky Day\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\" being the best in my opinion. \\"Last Carnival\\" is an emotional tribute to Danny Federici and I enjoyed it for that reason.  Others are not bad but simply not that good considering the incredible music Bruce has given us over such a long and spirited career.  \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is one of the worst songs Bruce has recorded in a long time and sounds like a cover of a cheesy 1970s tune from top-40 radio. (Ouch! Can't believe I wrote that about Bruce but it's true.)    I still love Bruce and the band and would see them live any chance I had but this CD is not up to his usual standards.
1416562605|4.0|I was very impressed with this novel. The story is vivid, and is not shy to touch on the corruptness of the government. The author may or may not be sharing his feelings on how \\"democracy\\" functions in India through his main character. Either way it definitely opens your eyes to what goes on in other countries, and how lucky we are to be Americans. Granted it IS a FICTION story, I'm sure there is some truth behind the main themes. It is a rags to riches story, but the main character gets his \\"riches\\" in a not so typical manner, killing his boss.
B000063DI8|5.0|This album gets little aclaim but,this cd rocks! Shorter songs,power chords that will rip your head off and Bruce Dickensons tarzanian vocals add up to a effort that will grab you and never let you go!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|In such a terrible year of movies, it's no wonder an independent film got all the rave. Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.<br /><br />This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen. A good story is what will bring the crowds. I mean no offense to Heath Ledger, but when a role in a summer blockbuster based on a comic book is given an Oscar. It just shows you how the so called Oscar worthy movies has gone downhill.<br /><br />*To redeem myself I thought that Heath Ledger was great in The Dark Knight and truly deserved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.ved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.
B00005JPY2|1.0|I'll try to be as kind as I can to this travesty but I just felt so apalled.    Why?    Alright, well first I'd better confess that I've never read the Watchmen comic books.  Seocond I saw the movie not aware that the story was about 'anti-heroes'.    If I could sum up Watchmen in a single word it would be \\"Nihilistic\\".    So we enter a story were all the characters are a bunch of washed up retired super heroes (the idea in itself is stupid.  If you have super abilities for life, your always going to have them, sure you could give it a rest but honestly, if anyway saw someone as awesome as 'Dr Manhattan', I don't think the world would just go on as normal and humanity just fights and kills itself.  The whole idea that turning this amazing individual into the source of hate and in the process saving humanity was simply ludicrous.  Further more, anyone that could become like that would surely have more depth than to roll around in there own self pity and then let something as fundamental as a relationship turn to slime.  COME ON!!!! ).    It's set in the 1980s (which is a great feature but once again a depiction of American 1980s(plus yes the alternate President Nixon version noted and also not agreed with) not the world(they even used a German 1980s song in the film, ironic).      The only moments of joy in the whole film was the 2 characters comming back to fly the super hero ship and do a bit of work and the scene with that mask character(yes the characters were so forgettable I've already forgotten there names), declaring in the prison: \\"You don't understand! I'm not in here with  you!,  Your in here with me!!\\".    My main dissapointment was 'Dr Manhattan\\".  COME ON!!! A super hero so insanely awesome, he could simply have stopped all wars by vaporising all the weapons only.  He could have taken every nuke on the face of the earth, turned them into there seperated molecular components and sent them into the sun.  Or even better recycled them into useful peices ofequipment.  Instead what does the character I was so drawn to get portrayed as?  A puppet for the government who goes into battles taking out waves of soldiers by destroying in a single thought and then winds up creating a fusion reactor or mass energy source without even knowing what the real intentions of the device will be????  UTTERLY REDICULOUS.  Sorry, this guy is a scientist, I think he would have a few more brain cells in there to consider the possibilities.  They whole 'I can see into everything and it all just becomes the same, a life is no different from my self constructed glass structure on Mars were I will sit and pontificate for the rest of my days because I couldn't find any miracles!!!\\"  WHAT THE @%^????  So with all he can do, he's no miracle?????????    Then there it is, the main point that totally blew, it's basically a simple fact that these writers only believe that all of humanity is a lost cause and that it takes mass devastation to herald peace.  What utter trash.  The end seemed to flow as if through there self sacrifce peace was achieved but at the cost of thousands of lives.  Well there self sacrifice if you could call it that was no different to a world war and we all know we never want to see those again besides the skirmish wars which sadly occur each and everyday, humanity is thankfully at the very least a global economy showing there is hope that we can all work together.    Perhaps I took this movie too seriously but for me, a super hero movie has always been about showing moral's, hope and presenting messages of importance to people.(Not just that humanity is a slime that is the cause of all misery, the cause of all misery is when individuals choose to look at the world in a certain way.  What I can not fathom is why all the marketing guff?  THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE (Although if any child saw it, I'd imagine they may fall asleep like my girlfriend did through the entire movie).  Why are there 'action figures', colouring books, big coloured mass produced badges, T-shirts etc?   This movie and it's associated graphic novel are known for being an adult comic and movie, it shouldn't be promoted even jokingly as if it were a family film.    Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, you should both be ashamed that you have wasted your lives bringing this miserable tale into existance and the only reason I'm wasting time writing this review is that so many people have hailed it as a masterpeice I wanted to take the time to speak up and break the unwarranted hype. (I did like Dr Manhattan but only what he could do, the character himself was utterly paper thin, but I guess as you wrote the story for comic books that was the point).    Sean A. Curtin    PS. Yes I know I will get flammed for this but before you have a rant at me, have a think about what kind of message this story gives.  I'm just beside myself that people are calling this story entertainment.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|After watching American Idol, I decided to purchase this CD. I was expecting a couple of radio quality songs and some not so great music, as is usually the case of an artist's first production when the music companies exercise control and make the decisions. I was wrong!!! After hearing the songs a few times, I must say that every song on this album touches me. I can hear every emotion David Cook feels. None of these songs were written to be radio hits (although they certainly have that potential). They were written to express a feeling and it comes through in every word. Fantastic job David! I am hard to please but you certainly pleased me! Keep up the good work.   As a side note,  I am not a teenager or a twenty something that has never heard 80's music. I am in my 40's and enjoyed that music. Although similar, I would venture to say it is disctint enough to carry itself.

0307237699|3.0|It was ok to read it.others , and it´d naturally be hard for various members of the Obama Nation and other movements related to Obama support or opposition , to provide such proof. I have at least two books this gentleman wrote , and intend to collect any other volumes , particularly in search of material that can give me ideas on horror or extremely harsh experiences in real life. We writers are like that. We tend to love to attack and love each other with equal measure. We don´t know why we do it. We just do. I feel overjoyed to know I´m not part of some large group of people who´d like to attack Obama in person because ´everybody else is doing it´. I find it funny to watch all those groupies attack or ´endorse´Obama on the Internet while I find it sad that they don´t produce more of theatrical works or litterary works geared toward that direction so those works can survive which in turn will increase the presence of the memory of this administration throughout history. Undeniably though , the Obama administration has been one of the most difficult to analyze so far and evaluate for the purposes of positive , simply negative , or harsh criticism. I think that is good news , as highly complex governments hopefully produce more thinkers. I feel that there are some similarities between the way the Obama administration has attempted to strieve towards success and several administrations in my country. My apologies if my criticism is full of factual errors , or has been presented awkardly.
0060558121|2.0|Starts off intriguingly, then proceeds to go nowhere. The \\"plot\\" is nonexistent, as the dull, lifeless main character goes from one random episode to next with no sense of progression or momentum. There was a pretty good story in there somewhere. I had been wanting to read this for years, but was disappointed. Lost interest around page 150 or so. Next...

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|As I watched this movie unfold, I was moved almost to tears. Is Clint Eastwood, an actor I've watched for 40 years, trying to tell us something? I got the same sense watching John Wayne in \\"THE SHOOTIST\\", his remarkable final film. If this is indeed the last time we will see Mr. Eastwood on the big screen, I must say \\"Bravo\\"! This is an intelligent, funny, thought provoking film that everyone should see. The Academy snubbed it because of the political incorrectness, but we see it for what it is trying to say. So see it, discuss it, laugh with it, cry with it, but most of all relish the man and his vision.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished my 30th day of the 30 Day Shred.  I got the DVD to stay in shape and to get toned, not so much to lose weight.  I did end up losing 4 pounds, my arms are toned, and I'm starting to show a six pack.      Absolutely fantastic purchase - worth every penny.  I had been working out on my own for months, seeing no results.  Jillian kicks your butt, but also makes it easy to stay motivated to do the workouts day after day.  In fact, although I finished the 30 days, I'm just about to start a second 30 days... but with heavier weights this time.    On another note, I've always been athletic... but not very coordinated at all.  I had a subscription to Shape magazine and often tried to do the workouts in it.  However, my body just didn't move the way the exercises showed me.  The exercises in this video are difficult, but not impossible to perform.

B000V86OKG|2.0|I enjoyed this program (although not as much as the first season). The biggest problem is the annoying DVD authoring. Not only are you forced to watch a couple of minutes of advertising and warnings on the insertion of each disc, but you can't even go from episode to episode without starting the disc over and going through the process again. Great if you like frustration, bad for normal people.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything \\"Gollum\\" said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was, and., hence, the film is great.  In fact, the more I watch this second \\"episode,\\" the better it gets!    Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.    This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?   It's still very worthy of buying this Extended Edition to get everything you can out of this fantastic story.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I remember clearly in 2002 I saw a trailer for this movie, somehow no one recalls this movie. I on the other hand could not wait for this movie to come out, I actually went to the cinemas to see it...unfortunately it had been taken out already. Anyway, I saw it as soon as it was released on DVD; and let me tell you that when I saw it for the first time it blew me away. The Story, the Acting and the out of this world action sequences.<br /><br />Now 7 years later...It didn't feel the same, the movie however still stands as an exceptional Sci-Fi film, but not as superb as I remember. The problems with the movie are mainly \\"plot holes\\" some are passable and others are as big as the Milky Way.<br /><br />The movie's premise is of a world commencing from start after a 3rd World War. According to the brief prologue we are supposed to accept that there is only one last remaining \\"civilized\\" society, known as Liberia. In Liberia, every citizen must take a doze of a drug known as \\"Prozium\\". This drug inhibits the effect of a robotic/non emotional being. So technically speaking no one can or exhibit emotions...\\"why\\"? well according to the story of the movie, emotions like hate, greed, and anger caused War. Yet without Emotions we seize to exist as humans beings, it is an essential part of who we are.<br /><br />shortly in the movie we are introduced to John Preston (Christian Bale) a \\"Grammaton Cleric\\" (futuristic officer) he exhibits the persona of a man troubled by lost of someone and himself, his emotions that have been repressed are demonstrated quite well in dream sequences and thoughts. As for what happens...Its quite obvious, he accidentally lets the dose fall on the floor...And voila he begins to \\"feel\\"<br /><br />So, pretty much the movie is interesting and contains a potential plot. \\"So what's wrong with it\\"? Unfortunately the problem with the movie is the plot holes. As I had said these plot holes are quite noticeable. I will write a short list of some of the most obvious mistakes. Anyhow, the movie borrows alot from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and even the city looks similar to Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis.<br /><br />Now, all of these mistakes are not to be taken as a reason to ignore this movie; on the contraire, this movie has still so much more to offer. The astonishing \\"Gun Kata\\" the technique to fight with guns blew me away, it is by far the most original idea I have ever seen in an action movie. Not one scene involving the \\"Gun Kata\\" looks bad. The best asset in the movie is Bale, he brings so much to the role, he takes the Semi-Original story and gives it heart and a push that made the film a sleeper hit.<br /><br /> This is a sci-fi vehicle at the most, but don't underestimate the directing of Kurt Wimer (who unfortunately directed a weaker film \\"Ultraviolet) he directed this movie so well for so little money. The entire cast gave a little to the story so we could forget in a way the mistakes in the movie. As well the sets and wardrobe are amazing, Preston's white suit, which resembles the morning suit of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, Gives a certain shine to action, it pretty much gives a splendor. With its Mistakes it still worth owning, classic modern science fiction at it's best.<br /><br />Some of the Mistakes<br />***Warning Spoilers Ahead***<br />1) Preston at the end can somehow dodge 1,000 of bullets and still kill everyone with out a scratch.<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Preston is the highest ranking officer, he is pretty much the best...but still come' on..Way to precise<br /><br />2) Partridge is reading a book of Yates; earlier in the movie it's much smaller<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- The angle in which we see the book the first time makes the book look tiny...hey it can be possible<br /><br />3) The character of Brent smiles all the time...Supposedly he takes the dose<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Brent could have not taken the dose at all or his smile is a senseless smile..a soulless smile<br /><br />Trust me it goes on and on with plot holes...but it still has alot of heart and potential. The vest is the acting and not to mention the music, which soars so triumphantly. Too bad there isn't a soundtrack. Anyway as I said, It's a must have even if it has mistakes.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5nd potential. The vest is the acting and not to mention the music, which soars so triumphantly. Too bad there isn't a soundtrack. Anyway as I said, It's a must have even if it has mistakes.      MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I must say, this is a great French movie about gaining spiritual freedom in this lifetime. It was cleverly done by Luc Besson and wonderfully acted out by Rie Rasmussen and Jamel Debbouze. Personally, I find Rie Rasmussen to be absolutely lovely and I am convinced the most beautiful women of Rome and Greece looked like her during ancient times. Jamel Debbouze made his character realistic and one of the best scenes in the movie is when he confronts himself in the mirror. Finally, the black and white backdrop of Paris was a stroke of artistic genuis. Love, and more love, this movie is highly recommended!!!
B00012FXB8|5.0|I am so very tired of seeing everyone trash this movie, only to go on and say that Aliens is the best in the series. I was fortunate enough to see them in order, theatrical versions, sometimes more than once. The first Alien is my all time favorite movie. It was Sci-Fi/Horror. I really really liked the 2nd, Aliens, which was Sci-Fi/Action. But I liked Alien3 better, Sci-Fi/Horror again being the genre. Fincher wanted to return the series to what it was, and he did perfectly, Sci-Fi/Horror! Things in the movie seemed to go too fast for me though. It wasn't until they released this version with the director's cut, that I understood what happened. The Director's Cut ended up making this movie so much better, that I would advise people only watch THIS version instead. The special facehugger I have seen some reviewers confused about is from the books. The Praetorian facehugger carries the Queen embryo, and is a little tougher than the regular fleshy colored facehuggers that everyone is used to. If you watch the documentary that comes with this edition you will understand and have a much greater appreciation for what Fincher tried to do here. If you hate the movie because there's no marines, or just because David Fincher directed it, then don't bother trying. You've already made up you're mind that you don't like, so hold tight to your little Aliens, because when that movie came out, Alien diehards didn't like it turning into an action flick. I am a fan of the series and the only film that upsets me is the first Alien vs. Predator. Paul Anderson decided to rewrite they way the creatures lived. Predators every 100 years? What about 1985 and 1997? And a Queen being frozen in the Antarctic for 100 years?    This new version of the film deserves a look from any Alien fan. A true fan of the series will appreciate the Directors Original Vision for what was to be the end of a classic Saga.    Seeing it 8 times in the theater made my skin freeze everytime I heard Ripley's original recording from the first movie's ending. Thinking that it WAS the end of the series.
0141030933|4.0|[[ASIN:0141030933 Regeneration]] is the first novel of a trilogy bearing the same name. In this book novelist Pat Barker tells the story of shell-shocked British officers receiving treatment in Edinburgh's Craiglockhart War Hospital under the care of Dr. W.H.R. Rivers. Barker chose to build the novel around real events and real characters: Dr. Rivers was a neurologist and anthropologist, and two of the principal characters are poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen.<br /><br />Sassoon, a successful and decorated commissioned officer, became disillusioned with the inhumanity of the war and what he called its deliberate prolongation. Though not a pacifist himself, he was influenced by pacifist friends and wrote a statement denouncing the suffering imposed on the troops. The military establishment determined that he was suffering from shell-shock and sent him to Rivers for rehabilitation.<br /><br />Rivers and his moral outlook are the centerpiece of Regeneration. The book takes its name from his groundbreaking work on nerve regeneration, and we follow his difficult work with the many physical and mental manifestations of war service among his patients at Craiglockhart. ''It was prolonged strain, immobility and helplessness that did the damage, and not the sudden shocks or bizarre horrors,'' Rivers wrote. Patriotic and supportive of the war himself, he faced the constant dilemma of treating men sent over the edge by life in the trenches and readying them to be sent back for more.<br /><br />Regeneration emphasizes themes of social class, gender roles and homosexuality. The war experienced by those fighting it  could never be known by those watching from home, and the bonds formed in service are shown to be complex. Emotional regeneration, through writing and talking about experienced horrors, reflects Barker's choice of Rivers as a central figure. In using real people and events, she shepherds us along ground already slightly familiar to the reader who knows anything about Sassoon's and Owen's poetry. She is a crisp and effective writer; with a trilogy in mind, she could have laid out the territory in pure fiction. I understand that the rest of the trilogy emphasizes the fictional characters. I look forward to reading [[ASIN:0452272726 The Eye in the Door]] and the Booker-winning [[ASIN:0452276721 The Ghost Road]], because as good as Regeneration is, it is clearly an unfinished story.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009Owen's poetry.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar in 2008 for his performance in this film. I can well understand why. Cast as an unscrupulous oil tycoon in the early part of the 20th century, he paints the portrait of true greed and ruthlessness.  He has no relationships, no family and no regrets as he cheats people out of their land in order to build oil wells.  There is no dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the film.  We see him prospecting for gold in a makeshift and dangerous shaft.  He's alone, and when he has a fall that breaks his leg, he pulls himself out of the shaft in grit and determination.  His characterization is set then.<br /><br />Later we see him working on a mine with a small baby in a basket.  He tells everyone this is his son and that his wife has died in childbirth, but throughout the film we never meet any woman in his life and there is no back story at all about the child.  He calls the child his son and is grooming him to be an oilman and there are some very poignant scenes between these two.  And then, an accident happens and his son becomes deaf.  The father does what he thinks is right, but leaves the son hating him forever.<br /><br />Into this mix comes a young evangelical preacher, played by Paul Dano, whose family sold oil to the oilman.  This young man is a religious zealot and wants say a prayer to dedicate the first oil well that is dug on the land.  But the oilman disrespects him and embarrasses him instead and this leads to a lifelong hatred and competition between them both, resulting in a rather confusing and violent conclusion to the film.<br /><br />The acting was superb. The theme was fascinating, and it moved so fast that its length of 158 minutes didn't bother me at all.  It is not for everybody though because it is very violent and the theme and plot are not tied up neatly.  Frankly, though I loved it.
B0007TKH66|2.0|Summary:  Awesome cast, great atmosphere, but the quality of the stories varies from the best   that science fiction has to offer to the most boring imaginable.    Main review  The concept of a series taking place shortly after the First Contact Movie is a brilliant idea. But it seems a long way from the idea to realisation. Already at the end of the pilot (Broken Bow) I missed the greatness this concept potentially has. You get thrown into \\"business as usually\\" (rescuing, exploring etc.) way too soon. I would have loved a pilot movie plus some more shows describing the time from first contact to the launch of Enterprise. That would have been something truly new. But this pilot is just an extended version of a 08/15-show.    The cast delivers frequently - Scott Bakula is on hell of as sovereign captain, Jolene Blalock is sexy as she is intelligent and plays T'Pol with a huge amount of depth. I could continue endlessly with Phlox, Hoshi, Trip, Malcolm...  It's an outstanding team with no need to fear comparison with a Picard, Spock, Scotty...  The set designers and the costume designers all did a great job (thanks for avoiding more romper suits).    But it is difficult when there are too many boring scripts.  Especially in the first two seasons contain too many shows following the pattern:  \\"Landing on an alien world, been taken prisoner, making an escape.\\" Even the visit to Risa follows this.  Also there is \\"being boarded, been held hostage, chasing away the enemy\\".  Then there are some episodes like \\"Shuttle pod one\\". The whole show consists of a rather dry talk between Malcolm and Trip. I can't imagine something more boring.  And a lot of the shows contain just a recycled script from \\"Next Generation\\", \\"Deep Space 9\\" and \\"Voyager\\", such as \\"Terra Nova\\", \\"Sleeping Dogs\\", \\"Dawn\\"...    But on the other hand you can't skip those episode - they sometimes contain important information on the characters. Therefore the waiting for the good and outstanding episodes is somewhat painful. These are the shows \\"The Andorian Incident\\" (I love the duplicity of the Andorians and there development into the 4th season) , \\"Shockwave\\", \\"First Flight\\" and the continuing plot about the Xindi (finally a few more star battles than in TOS, TNG and DS9).    Then when the series was already near its death the 4th season hit with power. The plot about the Augments could have been an Oscar-winning movie, and so would have been the story about the Vulcan's not been that perfect after all. The Andorians continue to deliver and the racial conflict with \\"Terra Prime\\" is the kind of stuff I waited 4 seasons for.    Conclusion  Seeing the 4th season there is defiantly potential for three more seasons.  But with the experiences of the first two seasons I can't blame the network for discontinuing the show.    I bought the slime line boxes and paid for each 13 British Pounds (18 US-Dollar). If I had paid the regular price for the first editions (80 Dollar) I would have been very upset.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I've always loved pretty much every incarnation of Journey to the Center of the Earth...ever since I read a comic rendition as a kid and then after reading the book.<br /><br />This rendition might just be my favorite.  Brendan Frasier does his signature comedic role in this movie where he and a couple of people wind up making their way to the Center of the Earth in the very traditional Jules Verne story.<br /><br />Don't expect an adult story, expect Verne's story.  Expect a pinch of comedy.  Expect Dinosaurs.  Expect neat special effects.  Expect to hang your brain at the door.<br /><br />This is a light airy movie that delivers marvelously provided you don't go into it expecting some kind of heavy drama, or high adventure.  If you're here for a lighter version of Journey to the Center of the Earth - this is it.<br /><br />Of note, there are really only 3 characters to this movie with minor characters coming in at the very beginning and then the very end.  So you'll wind up seeing a lot of Brendan Frasier and his couple of young cohorts.<br /><br />Enjoy.

The set designers and the costume designers all did a great job (thanks for avoiding more romper suits).    But it is difficult when there are too many boring scripts.  Especially in the first two seasons contain too many shows following the pattern:  \\"Landing on an alien world, been taken prisoner, making an escape.\\" Even the visit to Risa follows this.  Also there is \\"being boarded, been held hostage, chasing away the enemy\\".  Then there are some episodes like \\"Shuttle pod one\\". The whole show consists of a rather dry talk between Malcolm and Trip. I can't imagine something more boring.  And a lot of the shows contain just a recycled script from \\"Next Generation\\", \\"Deep Space 9\\" and \\"Voyager\\", such as \\"Terra Nova\\", \\"Sleeping Dogs\\", \\"Dawn\\"...    But on the other hand you can't skip those episode - they sometimes contain important information on the characters. Therefore the waiting for the good and outstanding episodes is somewhat painful. These are the shows \\"The Andorian Incident\\" (I love the duplicity of the Andorians and there development into the 4th season) , \\"Shockwave\\", \\"First Flight\\" and the continuing plot about the Xindi (finally a few more star battles than in TOS, TNG and DS9).    Then when the series was already near its death the 4th season hit with power. The plot about the Augments could have been an Oscar-winning movie, and so would have been the story about the Vulcan's not been that perfect after all. The Andorians continue to deliver and the racial conflict with \\"Terra Prime\\" is the kind of stuff I waited 4 seasons for.    Conclusion  Seeing the 4th season there is defiantly potential for three more seasons.  But with the experiences of the first two seasons I can't blame the network for discontinuing the show.    I bought the slime line boxes and paid for each 13 British Pounds (18 US-Dollar). If I had paid the regular price for the first editions (80 Dollar) I would have been very upset.
B000MRNWII|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MRNWII Concerto em Lisboa]]    I have been listening to \\"Fado\\" only in the last couple of years,but, i must say the lately i only listen to this fantastic way of expression.  Mariza? well..... it is something that conquer your feelings, your heart!  Amalia Rodriguez and Mariza The two most fantastic voices of all times, the old way and the modern way......Mariza? some of her cd and dvd have been played.....i wanted to say the amount of time being played but I lost the count; the Concert em Lisboa is certainly one of them. By the way your guess was wrong I am not Portoghese I am Italian! Enjoy music. Raffaele
B000AOEMXM|3.0|Summary:  Awesome cast, great atmosphere, but the quality of the stories varies from the best   that science fiction has to offer to the most boring imaginable.    Main review  The concept of a series taking place shortly after the First Contact Movie is a brilliant idea. But it seems a long way from the idea to realisation. Already at the end of the pilot (Broken Bow) I missed the greatness this concept potentially has. You get thrown into \\"business as usually\\" (rescuing, exploring etc.) way too soon. I would have loved a pilot movie plus some more shows describing the time from first contact to the launch of Enterprise. That would have been something truly new. But this pilot is just an extended version of a 08/15-show.    The cast delivers frequently - Scott Bakula is on hell of as sovereign captain, Jolene Blalock is sexy as she is intelligent and plays T'Pol with a huge amount of depth. I could continue endlessly with Phlox, Hoshi, Trip, Malcolm...  It's an outstanding team with no need to fear comparison with a Picard, Spock, Scotty...

B001KP2Y3K|5.0|....to a whole new level. I loved, and continue to listen to, Madeleine's previous albums, but this is an entirely new dimension...Madeline the songwriter. Whether her personal problems are solved, I don't know, but the girl uses her smoky, sultry voice to make us feel pain. And I didn't mind a bit. Listen to \\"i must be saved\\"...listen to \\"to love you all over again\\"...that's REAL heart-on-sleeve as good as you shall ever hear. \\"damn the circumstances\\", indeed.<br /><br />The opening number, \\"instead\\", is catchy (which is the idea), and \\"you can't do me\\" is as fine as I've ever heard her do. Ever. Even as a mere vocal trick it would be fantastic, but it's WAY more than that. And of course the messages of \\"river of tears\\" and \\"love and treachery\\" are self evident. But, lest you lose hope, try \\"homeless happiness\\"...<br /><br />Heck, try the whole record: you'll love it. Madeleine is in absolutely perfect voice, superbly backed-up, and presenting great material. I only hope this is a portent of things to come...I thought Madeline was already perfect; I was wrong...she keeps getting better. You Go, Girl. Seven stars, at least.
B000002J6H|5.0|I play guitar, have for 35 years, I used to play a somewhat decent version of Black Queen, but couldn't come close to Stills.  Have you ever tried to harmonize to notes on a guitar when playing lead?  I have guitar and harmonica runs I do while playing notes (not just chords) and that takes concentration and practice (and you don't have to worry that the harmonica will play the wrong note).      Stephen Stills is one of THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED muscians of all time.  From his acoustic guitar to his electric Rock guitar, keyboards and perfectly in-tune harmonies, this guy was the core of CSN hands down.  I am also a big Neil Young fan and I have the utmost respect for Crosby and Nash, terrific vocals and harmonies.  I really like Crosby on the early Jackson Browne albums.    People say that Neil and Stephen had guitar wars but the many times I saw them play together they complimented each other nicely.  Take a listen to the guitar work on \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\".  This lasted longer than many realize as they had an awesome Stills/Young tour in addition to the CSN&Y and Springfield days.  I would have liked more (like Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir) but am Grateful for the 10 or so albums they were on together and many concerts.    Sorry to be so long winded.  There are major great cuts on this CD, I like Go Back Home with Clapton a real lot but I think Black Queen is my favorite of all time, A) because it sounds so great and B) because I have never heard anything so difficult played so tightly.    Lastly, I also saw Stephen play solo on acoustic guitar.  He was absolutely superbe.  I wish the editor would have been there.
B000002WYT|5.0|Before writing my review I read through most of the folks that rated this album one star. Basically, their brilliant analysis of this record amounts to \\"this stuff is popular so of course it sucks!\\" and \\"these guys aren't real musicians!\\" and \\"Dave can't sing\\". Okay, if you don't like the singer's voice for any band it's difficult or impossible to listen to the band. Personally, I don't understand the dislike for Dave's voice - it is certainly nothing akin to Geddy Lee or other vocalists that commonly warrant contempt (from others, not me: I love RUSH and the only vocalist that I've found I can't stand is Josh Groban.)    So the other arguments for disliking this record amount to \\"I dislike this record\\", \\"DMB sucks!\\", and \\"anything popular is garbage!\\" - now, perhaps it is just me, but don't those opinions sound like air-headed, anti-establishment high school sophomores with a chip on their shoulder? To me they do. I know folks that hate anything that gets radio play. Why do they hate music that gains a visible public following? It seems they carry psychological scars - perhaps they were in punk bands in their younger years (or still are) and never made the millions that they now resent being made by bands like DMB. I can understand that resentment, but it doesn't make DMB bad - it just makes DMB a symbol for those poorer, emotionally driven non-fans. So sad.     It is sad because Dave Matthews *can* be a symbol of what great music aspires to be. I quit listening to music on the radio perhaps twenty years ago because there was so much drivel (and commercials.) I discovered Dave Matthews somewhat by accident and that event was like finding an oasis in the desert - holy cow, there are still musicians making music with complexity, real instruments, real voices, and real lyrics! And this was just before Crash was released. When I first heard Crash I knew that Under The Table And Dreaming was not just a fluke, that there really was a band that would be making music for decades to come that would evolve, grow, change, surprise me, and make me hunger for more.    This is a recording that satisfies from beginning to end. Yes, I love Proudest Monkey! Every song on this record has something great to offer and Lie In Our Graves is one of the best songs DMB has ever created. Yes, live versions of many of these songs are perhaps better or warmer. I like listening to the studio versions as well as the live versions and hearing the contrast. If you don't like studio versions, choose otherwise! Pretty simple.    Dave Matthews is not for the individual that rejects what has popularity for the sake of rejecting what is popular. If that describes you then I might suggest you avoid learning what is popular (I have no idea what industry chart numbers DMB records have reached because I choose not to make myself aware of industry charts) and instead learn to choose what is good because it is good. I believe that is part of growing up and thinking for yourself, ironic though that may sound.
0201626632|3.0|This book has the right idea.  But upon reading it (and it is a fast read; I finished it within a couple of hours), I didn't really feel like I learned anything.  Most of what was in the book was fairly intuitive.  While it was nice that Feibelman took a closer look at the career paths and expectations of a scientist, I didn't really feel like he contributed anything.  Most scientists already know that papers, funding and research presentations are vital to their careers.  But in his sections about each, he said little more than...make them good.  (OK, so that is an exaggeration, but I felt that there was little instruction and helpful advice).  He did a nice job describing the benefits and hassles of each career choice, but I felt that some of his scientific worlds were imaginary.  I've yet to find anyone who got a tenured professor position by skipping both an academic post doc and junior faculty position.  While I have known people to leave the corporate world for academia, those people just wind up years behind their peers who rode the academic ladder upwards, for the corporate turncoats still have to go back and do a junior faculty stint, if not a post doc as well.    My other gripe is that I feel the book is outdated.  Perhaps it is different in the land of physicists, but the youngest junior faculty members these days are mid to late 30s, not just turning 30.  In the world of biology, grad school takes 5-7 years, post docs 3-5.  Add on the fact that many soon to be grad students often take a stint in industry or as a lab tech before applying to school....    All in all, I feel that he tried to hit upon important points, but didn't really flush them out.  I suppose at the end of it, he forgot to follow his own presentation advice and tried to snowball us.
B00005JLD4|3.0|While there are plenty of panoramic shots of the vastness of the Australian outback, I never really felt the enormity of the accomplishment of a couple young girls walking over a thousand miles through this unforgiving land. I was expecting for the film to deal with the perils and struggles in this journey, but it dealt more with the politics of the adults trying to capture them. There was more weight given to eugenics than to establishing the personalities of the girls. There are scenes where people along the way assist the girls with food and coats, but in a walk of that distance that took a couple months, there must have been something more dramatic to deal with.(lack of water, dingos, poisonous snakes?)     The documentary in the special features was actually more interesting as you get to see the real personalities of the people involved. The scene where the girls were taken from their mother had the actors and onlookers emotionally overcome during the filming, but seemed to lose some of that power in the editing. Had to be there I guess. Not a bad movie, but it doesn't really fill in enough blanks.
0375507256|3.0|At the end, I'm still sorting out what I think of this book. In one sense, I feel let down by it. Common elements and images appeared in each story that built suspense throughout the novel, which gave me the expectation that as the book came to its conclusion something would fall like a lynchpin and completely alter the significance and context of each of the stories, uniting them into a coherent whole. This was not to be.     Each story was it's own, with only vague connections to the other stories. The relationship between the stories enriched them somewhat, but less than I had hoped. I found myself devouring the book just to get to the end and find out why these stories mattered so much to each other and when I got there, I didn't find it.     The moral--the common thread--seems little more than a platitude, and for that I'm disappointed.     Finally, the characters in one story seemed contrived and shallow to me, specifically, the female reporter and her boss were, to me, caricatures of Lois Lane and Perry White, and I found myself distracted from the story by the cliched dialogue. In another substory, I think setting it in Korea made an interesting story out of what would otherwise have been yet another dystopian cliche, and I don't know whether to admire the choice of setting or condemn that it may otherwise have been unimaginative.     BUT. . .     Cloud Atlas still gets 3 stars from me. I didn't love it, but it had many redeeming features.     First and foremost, the mood of the book was achieved remarkably, and I was particularly impressed at how the author selected such different writing styles to achieve different tone and mood from one story to the next.     The prose, tempo, and flow of the writing was fantastic. The book really pulled me into the characters' worlds (except for the noted exceptions), and I couldn't set it down.     I enjoyed the read, and I enjoyed how engaging the book was, but some of it had a bit of a pulpy and sentimental cast, andafter I finished, I had a feeling like I'd been reading too much fiction and needed to dig into something more significant.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I bought this one with lowered expectations, but was pleasantly surprised.  The movie was fun and the action was well choreographed.  I enjoyed it.
B00001OH7U|5.0|An inspired follow-up to \\"Young Americans,\\" David Bowie's \\"Station to Station\\" (1976) makes the seamless transition from plastic soul to atmospheric rock - thus paving the way for his 1977-79 Berlin Trilogy. The ambitious title track, \\"TVC 15\\" and \\"Golden Years\\" capture the musical chameleon at the top of his game. \\"Wild Is the Wind\\" (co-written by none other than Dimitri Tiomkin) provides a haunting finish. Along with \\"Scary Monsters,\\" Bowie's finest album.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|My fiancee, uncle, and I all watched this together one evening.  We all loved it :)
B00011F5DK|5.0|this game is very easy to learn and the more you play the more you see how complex it can be........very challenging,  you need to plan ahead some and think outside the box.  we love it,  very different and we are game people
B001E75QGG|1.0|I have never been more disappointed, that a movie I wanted to like so much, was just so terrible.  This couldn't have been worse.  South Parks spoof on this film was dead on...
0060763280|5.0|I bought this book because it was on a reading list from a yoga studio.  The fact that a book about money was on a yoga reading list immediately intrigued me.  Let me just say that this book totally changed my thoughts about money.  It forced me to expose (to myself) the deeply ingrained ideas I had about money that I acquired from my family.  For the first time in my life, I realized that what I thought about money just wasn't true.  I learned that I could change my perception of money.  This shift in my thinking was a pivotal event for me that led from my being a school teaching to owning my own business.  I am so grateful for this book.  Eker's seminars are outstanding as well.  Just like his book, he forces you to look at your habits and thoughts.  No hiding out in your comfort zone (so that's the link with yoga!).
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|Plot, story, development, premises... all just ridiculous and terrible.  Don't even bother renting this one and certainly don't buy it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased this for playing World of Warcraft and I don't think I could stand to play without it now.    Prior to owning this, I had played Warcraft for about 2.5 years. That entire time, I was a \\"clicker\\", using my mouse to click abilties on screen instead of keyboard buttons. When I decided to start keybinding with a keyboard, I tried for about three weeks and could never get good enough to be able to use any one of 20+ abilties, while moving with WASD keys at the same time. Also, I couldn't easily reach more than just a few keybinds, and the staggered layout of the keys on a qwerty keyboard didn't help.    The joystick and straight columns and rows of keys on the G13 totally solved my problem. It took a few days to really get used to keybinding, and about a week to memorize 20 binds. I am so accustomed to the pad now that any changing of keybinds feels natural and I can adapt instantly. When I play my tank, I am MUCH faster to react, now that I never have to take my eyes off the action to look down at the hotbars to click.    The macro function makes it extremely easy to press a key and have Heroic Strike (terrible constant-spam mechanic no other class has to deal with) fired off until I press the key again to end it. I have recently leveled a rogue and cannot imagine playing it without all abilities fully keybound while simultaneously moving as needed, which I could not do with a regular keyboard. It also makes me more effective on my mage.    Regardless of class, if you are currently clicking, absolutely nothing will improve your game as much as keybinding, and I don't think there is a better way than using this device.    My personal preference is setting the G15 key as Shift with pinkie finger resting on it, G10 as Alt with ring finger resting on it, and using middle and index fingers for G4, 5, 6 on the top row, 11, 12, 13 below them, and 17, 18, 19 below again as action keys. This easily creates 27 instant reaction keys, plus the two buttons near the stickfor different spam macros. Keys further out from center are for increasingly non-essential tasks like jump, tab, bags, mount etc.    It also looks sleek as hell and is quite sturdy, and easy to set up.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I can't wait to buy it on BluRay.  The amazing thing about PIXAR, along with their incredible animation, is their ORIGINAL stories.  PIXAR actually tells new stories that aren't remakes of older movies or books.  This one is some much fun and so cute.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|It was quite surprising that the songs on this album grabbed me more and more with each listen! I am finding myself humming the songs in my head throughout the day, they are definitly catchy and filled with a certain passion that is missing in most of today's releases. I hear tidbits of Michael Jackson when he rocks out, and dare I say...,.some Zeppelin when the upbeat rhythms kick in behind the rock growl. Laugh at the comparisons but you will hear these songs hitting the radio and blowing up. People want fun music they can feel right now. Not the abstract same old same old that Reznor, and modern day rock has been stuck in since the mid 90's. I think Trent Reznor is a little envious that his productions, while technically astute, don't come anywhere near pushing the boundaries while still being \\"listenable\\". This is a foray into rock/pop classics territory. Agree or disagree, that is your right, but I am happy that an album has been released that is able to flow from beginning to end with great songs, inspirational production, and the voice of a daring and talented artist who takes chances and breaks the mold. Chris Cornell will make 10 new fans for every old one he will alienate with this album. Spread the word, someone finally decided to be innovative!
B0000029J5|5.0|First album that I am aware of and beautiful voice and lyrics. He flew under my radar for many years but now I have all his music, I think.  What a fantastic artist, If only he had some live shows in the heartland.    Great acoustic album.
B000286RNY|3.0|I compare this movie to \\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\".  It is done in the same style with similar results.  This movie fuses kung-fu with comedy and is definitely a welcome addition to my collection.  However, it is not as funny, the action is not as good, and the story is not as compelling as \\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\".  A slightly better-than-average movie.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Funny movie and lots of good actor/actresses and a crazy story.  Love stories are thread throughout the movie and have several twist and turns.  Lots of singing and dancing and unexpected actions scenes. A little long so it might not appeal to young children. Would recommend 11 and older with family to really enjoy the movie. Carol Channing, Julie Andrews, John Fox and Mary Tayler Moore are just a few of the cast members.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|this is such a fantastic music collection.  it has introduced me to pieces felt had felt bored with to make me amazed. i have enjoyed this so much. & i think i have not got to the end of this.  she is way there,  way in there, it is very alive.      & ok, there is no sense in being grandiloquent or coy.  there are 8 excellent cds here for >$30.00 total.  you should get this before the suits read these reviews and figure out that they missed something (if we just enlarged the liner notes to greater than microscopic size...) and that they should chop these recordings up and charge a lot more for them one by one.  wow.      or maybe it is the dreadful economy, or some super suit said \\"sell everything\\" then \\"yes i mean including the good stuff\\" or i wonder if perhaps these recordings have an even better magic that is suit-proof with the power of years, & that is why they are here.
6302468027|5.0|Love this movie. Evelyn Couch (Bates) meets Ninny Theradgoode (Tandy) in a nursing home that leads to an unexcepted friendship. Ninny tells her a story of 2 women who lived half a century ago in the town of Whistle Stop. Idgie (Masterson) and Ruth (Parker) became close friends that lasted a lifetime. Idgie is an independent women standing up for herself and her friend to \\"men\\" during a time when a women's place was in the home. Evelyn is inspired to take a look at her life and make drastic changes, often with hilarious results. It makes you take a look at your own life and search yourself to see if you are such a friend. This story speaks of a simpler time and the strength of the human spirit that our forebearers had and how it still exists today!
0486440966|5.0|I read this book about 1.5 years ago and fell in love with it.  It's the kind of book you never want to end. My only wish is that Wilkie Collins had been a more prolific writer!
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead being the 1997 release and the 2nd studio album peaked at #2 in the UK charts and #21 on the Billboard 200. Songs that I particularly like on this release are \\"All Mine\\", \\"Over\\" and \\"Only You\\". The booklet is a strange story with no lyrics, grainy photos and a mess of a list on the back. 4/5.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Well... I think this album is thrilling. Cuz' these are all country music products. And to be honest Taylor is good at it. I mean she has got a super-duper voice just like her lyrics and the melodies of her songs. I really liked this album. T.S. is really talented. If you're into 21st century's country music I suggest you to buy this brilliant todays country music album. Because the talents like Taylor are so unique.
B000001FI7|5.0|Dummy being Portishead's 1994 release and their debut album and showcases some of the best of the trip hop sound. Songs that particularly stand out on this amazing release are \\"Sour Times\\", \\"Numb\\"  and \\"Glory Box\\". The booklet has many fine photographs and a list for each track of whom plays what. The booklet has no lyrics which is a shame. 5/5.
1843106698|5.0|Attwood has led the field when it comes to opening our minds to another way to look at this developmental disorder.  Filled with scientific research this book is not without heart.  Books on Asperger's Syndrome need to help the reader learn more but it is important to recognize that we are all part of the human condition.  Attwood does a marvelous job in weaving together a useful guidebook to this complex disorder.
0307269752|3.0|I found the book rather boring for these reasons:<br />1.) There is far too much colorless background information that drags on for over half the book.<br />2.) The dialog is stilted and all the characters are fairly one dimensional<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are in a situation that would be even longer and more boring than the book itself such as a 8 hour plane flight or an extended hospital stay.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I agree with the other sellers! This was in Korean. It should definitely say in the description that it is in another language, since this is the U.S.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Gojira- interesting name for a metal band.  It's how the Japanese originally referred to Godzilla.  And speaking of which, this album at times sounds like it could be the soundtrack to a Godzilla movie, when he is wreaking havoc and destroying buildings and such.    I would describe this album as heavy, varied, and original.  There is some technological audio manipulation on the vocals here and there, which is not too common in metal.  That adds to it's originality.  Every track is distinct.  They slow it down on occasion, but the heaviness moves along at a good pace and pervades most of the album.  And it's catchy...    \\"You have the power to heal yourself!!!\\" (track 9- Esoteric Surgery)    If you are a metal fan and you hear this album, guaranteed there will be something memorable about it that will stand out to you.  Maybe one or two things, maybe everything.  It's Gojira... RUN FOR COVER!!!
B001M4YZ90|3.0|Guy Ritchie's ROCKNROLLA is not as kinetic as his previous SNATCH and is a bit more subdued in comedy, action and violence. This entry into his brand of British ganster film genre is a bit more cerebral and needs a little bit more of a span of attention to follow what's going on. There's stolen money and a missing painting that must be found is the complicated plot in a nutshell. The characters are just as colorful as in his previous outings, but somehow they don't jump out of the screen. Remember Brad Pitt in SNATCH? The versatile Tom Wilkinson (THE FULL MONTY, BATMAN BEGINS) is always great in everything he does and plays a great crime boss in the film. Gerard Butler (300) is pretty good as a member of a band of thieves (called \\"The Wild Bunch) roaming London. Some interesting cameos include Jeremy Piven and Chris Bridges (aka rap star Ludacris) as record producers. Also, Thandie Newton plays a cool and beautiful (yet, questionably ethical)accountant of an equally questionable wealthy Russian real estate dealer. Overall, it's worth a look. One must see it a few times to appreciate the atmosphere of the film and to follow the plotline(s) because Guy Richie has a certain style of filmaking that is always interesting and fun. Perhaps his years of marriage to Madonna is to blame for a very slight subdued gangster film.
031606792X|5.0|I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around the negativity this amazing book has caused in the Twilight fandom. I have only been a 'Twihard' since January, and I have a feeling my reading all 4 books straight through let me enjoy the book more than older fans who had waited for this for almost a year. In any case, this \\"epic fail\\" business is ridiculously immature.    Basically, this book had everything I wanted. First, we have the wedding EVERYONE was waiting for and it did not dissapoint! I was shocked the wedding was so soon in the story, but was thrilled. Then the wonderful honeymoon. I know some fans wanted more detail on the actual wedding night, but I have to side with Stephenie here. This is the first time for Bella and Edward and there is something sacred about that. I didn't want to read smut.    But most fans seem to be with the book until this point. Then we come to what is possibly the stragest, most grousome and violent pregnancy/birth in all of literature. Stephenie already explained the \\"science\\" behind a male vampire creating a baby, but obviously lots of fans still don't accept that.    A major complaint seems to be that with the birth of the infamous Renesmee, we lose the epic love story that is Bella and Edward. I strongly dissagree! I love Nessie and I adored seeing Bella and Edward become parents. Their love didn't lessen - it matured and grew, and it was beautiful to see. I really think a second read is required to really see the nuances of how their relationship grows here. I adored seeing these two as parents!    Then we have imprinting, the bane of many fan's existance. Even though I hated Jacob in Eclipse, I am so glad that his strange, powerful relationship with Bella is finally explained!  I know it's seen as \\"creepy\\" by a lot of people, but I just see a loving, protective guardian protecting a sweet baby girl. We'll have to see if more is written about the Nessie/Jake relationship, but I love how it tied everything together. (even if 'tying everything together' is a negative, according to some of these reviews).    Another major plus for this book: Bella finally becoming a vampire! Wha twe've waited for since Twilight! I think any argument that Bella is a \\"weak\\" character can be put to rest after seeing the strong, capable way Bella handles being a Newborn. No weak-willed, simpy little girl could go through that Bella did. Some have dismissed Bella's easy transformation as too \\"Mary-Sue\\", but I see it as a strong character taking control of her destiny. Bella tramsforms from a frail human girl to a strong, capable wife and mother who saves her family. How cool is that?! The cover of this book perfectly portrays Bella's journey through this book.    The main complain about this book seems to be \\"Everyone gets what they want!\\" and I have to ask, what is wrong with that? I cannot understand why fans would want the saga to end in a massacre and have beloved characters killed off! I think there was enough drama and termoil through all four books to warrent a happy ending, and NOBODY does Happily Ever After like Stephenie Meyer! The last two pages were PERFECTION and I was crying and grinning like crazy at the same time.     I hope this review is helpful to anyone \\"on the fence\\" or at least shed some light on some of the amazing aspects of this book. Really, it is worth a second read.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I loved this series when it was on HBO and now the Blu-Ray version looks great.     I wouldn't consider myself a war buff but I loved this while it was on HBO and now I can watch it when ever I'm in the mood to spend the weekend on the couch.  Good storyline gets you to know the characters on a \\"personal\\" level and the 1080P makes it look spectacular.
B00143WLH2|5.0|Darwin, C. R. 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: John Murray. 1st edition, 1st issue.    How does one write a review of the Origin, that most influential of scientific books? Darwin's peers reviewed him critically and in great length according to the traditions and beliefs of the day. Yet a modern person inevitably reads the book influenced by their knowledge of the theory's great and lasting impact on science and culture. Likewise, a modern biologist would recognize the gaps and errors in Darwin's incomplete theory. Instead of evaluating its cultural impact or scientific value I will focus on its actual written style and argumentative structure. Was his argument logical? Was it \\"good science\\"?    Chapter one examines a practice already well-known to the English: artificial selection by breeding, or domestication. Horticulturalists and animal breeders already knew much about selection of variations through generations of practice. Darwin speculates on the scientific causes of variation, but concluded that not enough was known about the principles of inheritance to address the issue. Instead he focused on what he did know - only inherited variations come into play in selection. By taking up the study of pigeons, Darwin learned firsthand the art of animal breeding. By establishing himself as a pigeon expert, Darwin is trying to legitimize his claim as a zoologist and one who intimately understands breeding and domestication. His claim appears to work; at least has convinced me of his authority on the subject, and I'm sure many contemporary readers. By describing the accepted idea of artificial selection in detail, Darwin creates an analogy between it and his revolutionary idea of natural selection to enable the reader to grasp the concept more readily.    In chapters three and four Darwin introduces natural selection. He posits that natural selection acts on the same principles as artificial selection, but on a broader scale with no intelligent agent guiding it. Nature is a Malthusian struggle for existence - Darwin illustrates this by describing the geometrical increase that would result from unhindered reproduction. Many living organisms produce far more offspring than their environment could actually support, leading to a fierce competition for resources. Nature consists of checks and complicated relationships between species in order to preserve this precarious balance. If species are being naturally selected for fitness in this savage environment minute by minute over a vast time, it could explain the immense number of different species we observe in nature.     Darwin details his mechanism of natural selection by listing the conditions in which it would work faster or slower, including intercrossing, isolated populations, and number of individuals. The means of natural selection is to a large degree sexual selection, by which species choose the fittest mates and pass down successful inherited qualities. Natural selection may even cause a species to become extinct if it is not able to compete with other species. Trying to portray natural selection as an unfeeling force of nature, Darwin was not hesitant to describe the savage ways that species compete with each other, including parasites.     In chapter six Darwin addresses possible objections to his theory, as should any well structured argument. For example, according to natural selection, we should see such a progression of species showing every step of modification between two related but divergent species. Yet we do not see such species in nature - Darwin concludes that they probably went extinct, since natural selection would favor extremes so that species would not occupy the same niche. Only in the fossil record may we find such intermediary species, and the fossil record will always be incomplete. One popular argument against natural selection both then and now is the\\"organs of extreme perfection\\" argument, of which the eye is the most popular example. How could the eye, an organ so perfectly adapted to perceive light, have evolved by random variation? Darwin answers this objection by recounting observations of eyes in crustaceans, which are presumably relics of mammalian evolution. He observes that the crustacean eye is a less developed, less sophisticated version of the mammalian eye and thus can illuminate the transitory steps that resulted from random variation over the ages to result in the perfected eye. Darwin also points out that not all animal organs are perfectly suited to their task. What about the peculiarity of humans in that all food must pass over the trachea, leading to possible risk of infection if food enters the lungs? The glottis seems like a stopgap, an imperfect measure to ensure that this does not normally happen. That such evolutionary maladaptations exist points to a lack of  an intelligent design.     In his conclusion, Darwin agrees that there are holes in his theory and aspects which could be better explained. After all, his Origins is just an abstract of the real book that he hoped to publish. Yet on the whole, he is convinced that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of natural selection. His argument is logical, and according to the Whewellian model of inductive reasoning he has gathered a bewildering array of observations from nature to examples to support his hypothesis. At a time when hypothesizing was not considered \\"good science\\", Darwin still submitted his broad theory because he realized it explained many observations in many different fields of science. Even now, his theory explains scientific findings that Darwin could never have dreamed of.  Such is the legacy of true \\"good science\\".
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Wrath is an excellent album.  Randy's best vocal work, period.  If you like metal, real metal, you'll love this album.  It is straight forward with great riffs and focused song writing.  It is a lot better than Sacrament and the production is simpler, which allows the band to truly shine with their instruments.  Reclamation is the song the band's been trying to write for their last track.  It is an absolute monster!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Sparks does it again, another wonderful story. He pulls you and takes you for a wonderful ride. You almost hear the rain from the storm and hear Elizabeth screaming. He always writes his stories so that by the end you are hoping it isn't going to end. Can't wait to read his next one.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|i was also a bit taken aback when i heard chris was working with Timbaland but i stopped and thought \\"hmmm...that could work as long as his voice sounds good\\" and goddammit it does!!  it actually sounds the best its sounded since Soundgarden!  In addition to Audioslave being extrememly boring (i was not a fan of Rage), most of the songs i heard sounded like they were recorded the morning after chris had a horrible hangover...his voice sounded awful!  His 2 previous solo albums lacked alot of imagination also as far as guitar work goes, but hey, everyone deserves another shot especially when its chris cornell.  Anyone willing to open their mind and just chill and listen while this record is on will be greatly rewarded.  There isn't much in the way of loud guitars, but all the songs are really well written/executed with the standouts being \\"scream\\", \\"never far away\\", and \\"long gone\\", which are as good and as catchy as anything Soundgarden ever did.  Just think a funkier version of \\"fopp\\" as an overall theme...  -abortionrock '09
B001QPBKJI|3.0|I'm only reviewing the short 30 second sound bites provided by Amazon.  Based on those alone, I decided not to purchase this album.  Though Ms. Mutter's performance is technically accurate, the music comes across lackluster and unimaginative.  There is nothing here to set it apart from other renditions of the same piece.  It's like looking at a very good copy of the Mona Lisa.  You know in your heart that something is missing, but can't quite put your finger on it.  The cover is the best part of this album.
6305882592|5.0|This was my most favorite movie of all times, because of the message it gives which unfortunately many people miss. I was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD. I had it on VCR from Amazon, loaned it to some family members who thoroughly enjoyed it. My niece used it for her Masters in Social Work, but I never got it back. Now I don't have a VCR player so I was thrilled to get it again in DVD. This time I am not loaning it to anyone!!! Thank you for making \\"old movies\\" available again in a new format. I love shopping with Amazon!
1401300529|1.0|Given the level of scholarship and style in Halberstam's previous works, The Coldest Winter is embarassing to read.     As an expert on the Korean War, I had to give up on this book in the first 50 pages. The factual errors about the events on the ground and lack of knowledge about military practices plus the lack of an editor made this book difficult to read. I was wincing every page.    A much better work is Clay Blair's [[ASIN:1591140757 The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950-1953]] - it presents the events on the ground, the policy issues, the personalities, and the good and bad in a much more thorough and detailed manner.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins book, The God Delusion is at once a powerful and passionate plea for Americans to wake up before it's too late, and a logical humanist alternative to destructive religious dogma.<br />In his book, Dawkins removes the gloves and comes out fighting. He does not \\"sugar coat\\" any of the sensitive issues or make any attempt to cuddle or sympathize with those who choose to believe in fairy tales and force their ridicules beliefs on to those who have better sence. He is blunt, articulate and thorough, using science, philosophy, and just plain common logic to completely destroy the notion of God once and for all.<br />Dawkins lays out all the evidence on the table, and explains it for anyone to understand. He leaves no stone unturned, and provides copious references. I would challenge any theist to effectively counter the abundance of evidence presented here.<br />This is indeed one of the most important (and unfortunately, necessary) books of our age, and should be read by every policy maker, teacher, and free thinking citizen in America.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|The saddest thing about artists (and their fans?) has to be the painful recognition that creativity, like all human things, is perishable. It runs its course and dies. Few are those who keep growing artistically well into their old age. (Think of Verdi, whose masterpieces come at the end.) Those are exceptions. In general, things go à la Bruce. Bruce put out a relentless, unbroken string of masterpieces (since his first, Born to Run) up to Tunnel of Love, over twenty years ago. Tunnel of Love was the last unquestionable gem, with songs striking an almost supernatural balance of finesse, poetry, and catchy thrust. Catchy, clever, moving, slightly surreal: in short, the best Springsteen ever gave us, even surpassing (in my modest opinion) the legendary Born in the USA.    It was the highest he would ever reach. And the subsequent cataclysmic fall was all the more traumatic for it. It came in the guise of the hastily cobbled together Human Touch/Lucky Town (sounds like a comedy duo, a  listless Dumb and Dumber deal), the second of which must still hold the distinction of representing the artist's absolute nadir.    Ever since, it's been hit and miss, as mediocre to decent rock albums came interspersed with pointless forays into folk (the same way Mark Knopfler went country, and Van Morrison went blues, curiously around the same time, the end of the eighties, as their creativity too began to plummet: which seems to reveal a pattern for the aging rocker...).    This is not to say that Bruce has been unlistenable in the last twenty years. Just that he's been but the shadow of his former artistic self, working on autopilot, his mother lode long exhausted. (\\"I just want to hear some rhythm\\", he screams in his muddy \\"Radio Nowhere\\" from \\"Magic\\": Might he be addressing himself?).   It might be naive to wonder why an artist does not hang it up  when he/she perceives that moment has come, what prompts him/her to continue. Inertia?  Self-delusion? (It's not like Bruce needs a monthly paycheck by now...) A sense of mission? An obligation? I don't know, but it's a bittersweet reality, sustained by fans like us who wouldn't want him to pack it in, in spite of it all. As mortals, we resist endings. So, it comes down to a tradeoff. Would you give up the expectation/joy for a new Bruce album, even if you know it will be followed by disappointment? Perhaps a bad Bruce is better than no Bruce at all.    I realize I haven't said much about this album, but many have already, and there's a pattern of dissatisfaction and disappointment that speaks for itself. Hard to fathom that the same man who gave us \\"Tougher than the Rest\\" is the artificer of \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\"--but the shock was greater when he gave us \\"Lucky Town\\" twenty years ago, hot on the heels of \\"Tunnel\\". Now, as we have all grown older, expectations will have inevitably shrunk, and a modicum of skepticism will have set in. Like in anything else.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|What a treat it was to introduce my wife to the original Stargate movie after we had already begun buying and watching the boxed sets from the television series. We enjoyed it immensely. I'd always wondered why this movie didn't get the same appreciation as other classics such as Star Wars, Terminator, and maybe even Dune (mini-series). It is interesting to see how the original characters brought to the screen by Kurt Russell and James Spader were carried forward by Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks.<br /><br />Amazon's review calls this 'hokey' and that's a shame. It's just a lot of fun and shouldn't be taken any more seriously than Star Trek or any of the other films in its genre. In fact, I appreciated that they didn't try to caption the other world denizens when they spoke their language; their faces were expressive enough to convey meaning. I always liked James Spader's passionate sincerity.<br /><br />The Blu-ray re-production is nicely done, retaining its film grain and theater feeling. I would have liked some extra features but I'm appreciative that it has been released in this format.[[ASIN:B000HIVOI2 Stargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]]
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I've anticipated the release of Pinocchio for such a while that I read the \\"reviews\\" posted her before there was a blu-ray product to review. After viewing, I feel compelled to respond with my first ever internet review. Before discussing the quality of the blu-ray rendering, I think it's instructive to address the cel versus computer animation \\"question\\".    Six years of my early life were spent in 35 mm special effects cinematography. Since then I've taught sciences where I've used a hobby of computer animation to create instructional materials. This hobby grew into creating and teaching a course in computer modeling and animation.    Two main technical aspects differentiate cel animation (Pinocchio) from computer animation ala Pixar, Dreamworks et al. In computer animation, it's possible to texture a surface whereby, processing power permitting, as much fine detail can cover a surface as desired. And with the application of a \\"tag\\", this detail can be affixed to the surface in such a way as to deform with the character. Furthermore, again given sufficient processing power, surfaces can be made with smooth enough curvature to allow for incredible range in the gradients of reflected lights. This amount of detail and attenuation of light is simply not, in realistic terms, possible with cel animation.    Secondly, in computer animation the dividing line between a character and the background is not a line at all but a sharply delineated boundary. In traditional cell animation, characters usually have drawn silhouettes of finite thickness.    So, if you're viewing blu-ray Pinocchio expecting the eye-popping sharpness and color gradations of Ratatouille or Wall-E you might be disappointed. For example, an examination of the blue fairy won't show much in the way of facial structure such as cheekbones and the silhouette is anything but distinct. Of course, much of this is intentional in the blue fairy's case, helping convey her ethereal quality. But check out the eyes and immerse yourself in the whole package. She's still the quintessential magical mother figure she was for me when I first saw Pinocchio in 1950. My wife, substantially younger, remembers it the same way from a later generation.    Once past the sharpness and textural differences from that in CA, you'll note a richness in color in Pinocchio. This is especially evident in many backgrounds where, not bound by the constraints of needing to animate from frame to frame, more textural detail can be used. The hand painting, beautiful pastels and use of shadows make this well worth the wait for blu-ray.    As far as the CA vs. cell debate, I've long awaited the advent of CA. I'll buy Nemo on BD the day it's released. I think John Lassiter is an incredible talent and has made entertainment a happier place. It's hard to match a unforgettable character like Dory. And I think I must have laughed every ten seconds through Shrek 2.    In my opinion, the only thing additional Pinocchio offers is magic. But don't ask me, ask my almost four year old niece. She is a product of several trips to the theater as well as a plethora of animation DVD's at home. We viewed Pinocchio after a long awaited sleepover last night. She was mesmerized and declared it \\"the best\\". It was what she woke up talking about at 5 AM this morning. We watched it again, in its entirety, before dance class. But from now on, we save it for special occasions as opposed to watching snippets here and there.
1416562591|5.0|This is first rate fiction that is hard to put down once you start.  The protagonist narrates his own past to Mr. Wen Jianbao, one of the highest ranking officials of China. It's the story of Balram who is from the lower rungs of the prevalent caste system in India and his determination to make a decent living in spite of all the odds from within his own family, culture, religion, employer, society and government.  Eventually he succeeds even if  he has to beg, borrow, lie, cheat, blackmail, steal or even kill !.  Now, there have been a few books in the past depicting the life of the working poor in India, but none of them succeed in breaking through the system to a better life.  What is different about this book is that, the protagonist does succeed !.      Aravind Adiga has done a wonderful job of keeping the reader entertained while also stating the truths about global economy, outsourcing, the caste system, democracy and entrepreneurs, communism and lack of entrepreneurs ( remember it is being narrated to Wen Jianbao ! ) and last but not the least the caste system and the servitude drilled into the very souls of people.  But I disagree with AA, when he states that until 1947, the different castes were coexisting peacefully like animals caged in a zoo, each in his own place.  The caste system had always worked for the people at the top just like slavery in America worked for the plantation owners in the south. As AA states, after circa 1947,  the cages were opened and there was chaos and thus began the slow collapse of the hierarchy of the caste system.. As they say, no positive change is possible without chaos. Do yourself a favor and read this wonderful book to have fun and know about human spiders, rooster coop, black egg, master-slave dynamics, the great Indian family, marvels of democracy,  the powerful communist nation, the rise of the yellow and brown man, fall of the white masters, the unknown destiny of men of  all other colors. We need more White Tigers!.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Not as immediate as 'Magic' nor destined to be a classic like 'Born to Run' or 'Born in the U.S.A,' the Boss of rock 'n' roll still delivers amply for his latest studio c.d. Turning from social and political matters, Springsteen focuses primarily on the landscape of love, which he and the E-Street band unfold with finesse. Charting on many musical territories, including blues (\\"Good Eye\\") rollicking folk (\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\") and rock 'n' roll as we've always known from him (\\"My Lucky Day\\"), there's not a weak track in the bunch.    His primary suit here is intricate love songs, especially \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" and \\"Kingdom of Days,\\" which serenade the listener like 'Tunnel of Love' in their richness. The production is nearly as slick as 'Magic,' but he wisely doesn't overproduce, which some saw as a flaw on the former. \\"The Last Carnival\\" provides some spare acoustical excellence, which only underscores the diversity we've always come to expect from Bruce and his band all these years.
159102594X|5.0|I've read all the popular fantasy series -- from the critically praised (Martin, Keyes, Lynch, etc.) to the often panned (Goodkind).  While I have enjoyed most of them, this series truly belongs to the top tier.    Characters that you understand & care about, great battle scenes/description, magic that isn't overused and has some unique features, etc.    I would consider Abercrombie's series a MUST READ for the fantasy fan.

0743289692|5.0|This book is an important expose of how bad Islam and the hate culture it spawned is. It is not an apologia for the religion and culture at all - it is a terrible tale of suffering and liberation. It is the personal story of an incredible woman.<br /><br />This woman is the author - Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Ayaan was born in Somalia in a family situation that is vividly described. Her father married her mother as his second marriage and there is a child by the first marriage. As you read the story, you see that he moves on from marriage to marriage and woman to woman. If you wonder why, you learn that this is perfectly acceptable in his tribal world. While the father is a functionary in the resistance movement to the Somali dictator, he is actually a very liberal man who insists that his girls go to school and get educated. The mother is somewhat liberal as well - she is taken aback when the grandmother arranges for the female genital mutilation to be performed on the girls. But these signs of liberalism do not get very far - the mother routinely ties Ayaan up and beats her and her sister; the grandmother beats them and instills in them fear of everyone; and the father insists that she must live a good moslem and is happiest when he arranges marriages for the two girls.<br /><br />As we read the story of her growing up in the environment of the second half of the 20th century, I kept thinking to myself of how barbaric the circumstances she describes are. These practices may have been acceptable in the dark ages, but how can we condone them over the past century? And yet, she is clearly an exception and she points out that the majority of women who live under Islam suffer similar abuses and worse even today. They put up with it because they are indoctrinated this way from the moment they are born.<br /><br />Most of the book details her early history. At the age of 20 she manages to escape this life by becoming a political refugee in Holland and her eyes are opened. The wonder that she describes at experiencing the ways of the west, and the revelations that women need not be physically, mentally, and emotionally abused routinely; that it is not acceptable to be forced to be married against her will; that societies actually perform much better in the west than in the Islamic countries has clearly struck chords in her soul.<br /><br />She goes on to become a Dutch citizen and within a few years is nominated to the Dutch parliament. She becomes a politician because she notices that the other Somali and Islamic refugees in Holland and the rest of Europe are not integrating into Dutch society - because they are importing Mogadishu to Leiden - and she is alarmed by this. So, she makes it her mission to start the debate in Holland as to how to approach Islam. This turns most of the Islamic world against her and she receives death threats. The worst comes when an acquaintance of hers (Theo Van Gogh) is murdered by a moslem after the two collaborate on a short film that points out the mistreatment of women by Islam.<br /><br />The last part of the book tells of the tumult that this engenders and how the tolerant Dutch are not willing to face the real problems with Islam - preferring to believe that it must be a problem with the west for generating such hatred - rather than Islam itself being the cause. Ultimately, she is forced to leave the Dutch parliament, even leave Holland altogether, and currently she resides in the United States as a scholar.<br /><br />She summarizes her life's learning the following way: \\"I could no longer avoid seeing the totalitarianism that is Islam. It regulated every detail of life and subjugates free will. Their world is divided between \\"Us\\" and \\"Them\\" - if you don't accept Islam you should perish.\\" \\"The kind of thinking I saw is incompatible with human rights and liberal values. It preserves a feudal mind-set based on tribal concepts of honor and shame.\\" \\"The message of this book, is that we in the West would bewrong to prolong the pain of the transition unnecessarily by elevating cultures full of bigotry and hatred towards women to the stature of respectable ways of life.\\"<br /><br />I cannot think of anyone in the West who could speak like this and not be pilloried for being anti Islam, but Ayaan proves through the pages of this book that she has earned the right to criticize the religion and culture because she lived in them and has seen them from the inside and has suffered immensely - and she is trying to help all the other subjects who live in these inhumane conditions from suffering the same fate. This is a must-read book!cessarily by elevating cultures full of bigotry and hatred towards women to the stature of respectable ways of life.\\"    I cannot think of anyone in the West who could speak like this and not be pilloried for being anti Islam, but Ayaan proves through the pages of this book that she has earned the right to criticize the religion and culture because she lived in them and has seen them from the inside and has suffered immensely - and she is trying to help all the other subjects who live in these inhumane conditions from suffering the same fate.

It's great that he made something of himself even with a father like his that was a terrible role model.  It just goes to show you no matter what we went through when we were kids, when you leave home you can rise above poverty by working hard and making the right choices.  You don't have to be like your parents.  This book kept my attention even at the very beginning.  For me, if it starts out dull I won't read the rest but I could not put this book down.  I can't wait to read the other one's.

B001MYIXAW|4.0|This is not the best vampire movie ever made. The cover box claims this and that is certainly not the case.  However this is a excellent vampire horror movie that has a long pedigree in film.  This isn't a horror movie pedigree but instead the idea of a friendless outcast boy finding a friend or champion in a stronger person or in this case a vampire girl.  The story is well acted and I didn't mind  the english dubbing at all. They should have offered a subtitled version but that is not a real problem in enjoying this movie. And it is enjoyable with richly defined lead characters and good special effects.  Fans of fun and fast moving gross out movies who don't want a drama context and a solid story might not like this one. However  Those fans need to branch out though into this type of story driven horror flick too ,as they are excellent too.  This is a story that is like a fairy tale story of old in some ways. And those were bloody tales when they were first told too.  This movie focuses on the relationship between the two lead characters as much as the violence and horror.  This movie reminded me of the classic horror flick Beauty and the beast (the 1946 version) in it's careful attention to detail in characterization and that's a great horror movie from that period.  On blu ray this movie looks great which really brings out the excellent photography of the frozen swedish landscape of the story.  This is just a well done movie that even people who aren't horror fans can enjoy.

I don't care much for Mustangs Or Fords or Mopars(the bad guy drives a Sinister black Dodge Charger) . It's a Good movie, and steve mcqueen does not act much, but it's good, it's street, gritty. This was in the era of GOOD COP Movies and Shows 60s-70's. Not like today. A Cinematic Masterpiece even if you wished it would had been a Corvette As the Main star not a Green Ford Mustang Fastback.

B00008DDRX|5.0|I wish it would have been Corvette instead of Porsche but oh well. Not much acting from Mcqueen. a Little Long, But Great Le Mans Action. And a Great Cinematic Racing Masterpiece. Porsche Vs. Ferrari.(dont care for neither) but still good movie.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Normally I hate romance flicks, but I had to see The Reader, especially after watching Kate Winslet win her long overdue Oscar for Best Actress, I had to see this film. And boy did it turn out to be a lot better than I expected! It was a lot more different than what I expect, and it was much more different than a LOT of movies I've seen out there.<br /><br />I will warn people- people who are not into ephebophilia-related content will want to stay away from this movie. The plot will disturb some.<br /><br />Michael Berg is a 15 year old boy who is very sick, and is rescued one day by Hanna Shmitz, a 30-year old illiterate. This situation later turns into a love affair, where he not only makes love to her but also reads full books to her aloud. However, shortly after his 16th birthday, Hanna moves, and years later Michael takes a Law seminar, where he watches Hanna, having joined the the SS, be prosecuted. As years go by and their relationship becomes very distant.<br /><br />This is a strong and very powerful film that you simply will not forget. It has an excellent performance from Winslet, and even Michael Kross is great for a teen actor. As well as Ralph Fiennes turns in an excellent performance as the old Michael. And the movie is very sad, but very uplifted, and this is one of the few tragic movies in which I can totally feel for the characters.<br /><br />An unforgettable and powerful film that will stay with you for days, The Reader is a must-see film. Do not miss it!

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's newest book is a must read for all who are interested in what it takes to be successful... the over-riding theme of the book is the idea it takes \\"the perfect storm\\" of timing, luck, family and cultural background and \\"practical intelligence\\" to produce a mega-successful person such as a professional athlete - or Bill Gates.    Beyond the rare individual who is highly successful, there is much here for those of us who are looking for hints regarding how to be successful, or how to help our kids achieve success...    According to Gladwell, I.Q., beyond a certain baseline, is almost never a factor a major contributing factor in one's success. A cultural background which teaches hard work and long hours of dedication to perfecting one's craft will often trump raw intelligence.    Good schools are good enough - Havard doesn't produce as many Nobel Peace Prize winner as one might think, considering it's prominence. A cultural background which teaches and values assertiveness can be the key which gets you into a good school, propels you into a leadership position in your field - - or keeps you and your passengers alive while piloting a commercial aircraft!    Gladwell, once again, forces us to look at life from new and intriguing angles... and once again, refuses to offer up simple answers to complex questions. Outliers, for me at least, was yet another page turner...    Gladwell ends this book with a reflective account of his own family's road map to success, including some VERY interesting insights into the multi-faceted role race played in his own family [his African great-grandmother was purchased from a Jamaican slave auction block by his white great-grandfather, his Jamaican mother was educated in England and married an Englishman, Malcolm's father] and how his mother reconciled the conflicting legacies of advantages given to lighter-skinned Jamaicans, such as her bi-racial mother, and prejudices she herself experienced as a Jamaican married to anEnglishman.

0061053147|4.0|It was only slightly surprising that when in 2004 the influential British newspaper The Guardian ran a poll of scientists asking them which their favourite science-fiction film of all time was, Blade Runner scored the first place. The more discerning fans have known Blade Runner - in its various versions - as a film that has it all: substance, story, style and serious significance. Yet, upon release in 1982 the film was met with reactions ranging from derision (many critics have since recanted) to indifference. The film lost money and was destined to be buried; yet, something soon happened. The film found a new audience on video and there has been no turning back.<br /><br />Classics are made in the long-term.<br /><br />Journalist and author Paul M. Sammon was initially assigned to write an article on the film Scott Ridley (Alien) was shooting based on Philip K. Dick's short sci-fi book, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep. This assignment soon grew and developed, in tandem with the film's labourious production, and around 1997 became 400 pages of unsurpassed information on the fascinating cyberpunk film Blade Runner. Chock full of data, time-lines, scene-by-scene examination and technical data Future Noir - The Making Of Blade Runner is a valuable book for fans of the film especially given its status as neither an industry sanctioned publication nor an official accompaniment. Like many who would come across the film - including the aforementioned scientists - the author would soon become a fan.<br /><br />The book's importance and value might be slightly diminished with the release of a British documentary on the subject and of the Blade Runner definitive edition DVDs in 2008 [[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)]], given the in-depth treatment the box-sets dedicate to the film's backgrounds, but Future Noir is still a marvelous source of information regarding this classic of cinema. The author's writing style leaves some things to be desired and the book is not beyond a mistake or two - BBC is not the British Broadcasting Company and a caption spelling Pyke mistakenly 'Pike', etc. - but the wealth of information (like screenwriter Peoples' admission that he had Scott confused) and trivia (Peoples' daughter came up with term 'replicant' in lieu of the overused 'android') are interesting. Be it script information, omitted scenes, budget battles (and Scott calling film making '\\"war\\"), animal associations in a world devoid of beasts and more Future Noir finds space within its pages.  Also worthy of note is a series of interviews spanning eighteen pages with Ridley himself where several puzzles get solved and question marks disappear.<br /><br />A prerequisite to reading Sammon's anthology is having watched the film. Be careful, however, for Blade Runner has a habit of drawing one in and adding just a little with every subsequent viewing. That is why Future Noir is both probably necessary and interesting.beyond a mistake or two - BBC is not the British Broadcasting Company and a caption spelling Pyke mistakenly 'Pike', etc. - but the wealth of information (like screenwriter Peoples' admission that he had Scott confused) and trivia (Peoples' daughter came up with term 'replicant' in lieu of the overused 'android') are interesting.

0060512806|4.0|If you care to put the time into reading it, \\"Cryptonomicon\\" will blow your mind. It's true that nobody ever accused Neal Stephenson of being shortwinded, but the man definitely has something to say. This book tied three stories of war, code-breaking, and hacking into one cohesive narrative. Everything tied together. Everything. It wrapped up a little too succintly in the end for my taste, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The portions concerning the Pacific theater in World War II were particularly interesting because I knew almost nothing about it. I don't expect to read this again any time soon, but I will absolutely continue to recommend it.
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|Madeleine's  musical training came on the streets of Paris, where she started as a busker, then after a street-corner audition she got a gig singing with the Lost Wandering Blues and Jazz band, performing songs by artists such as Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday and Fats Waller.  Her previous albums [[ASIN:B0002NRRAG Careless Love]] and [[ASIN:B000GFLE86 Half the Perfect World]] sold over a million copies, earning critical-acclaim for her Jazz-Blues interpretations of works by artists such as Leonard Cohen and Edith Piath.  When she went \\"missing\\" in Britain while promoting her breakthrough album \\"Careless Love\\", her record company couldn't wait to tell the media.  How better to differentiate Maddie from the rest of the jazz-lite crew than by painting her as a wayward chanteuse? She hadn't disappeared, of course. She'd simply become bored with the promo-circus and gone back to New York. And who could blame her?   But Madeleine didn't need a vanishing act to raise her above her rivals. Her smoke-and-honey vocals, Billie Holiday phrasing, and breezily bohemian way with classy material had assured her fanbase.  They won't be disappointed by her new release, \\"Bare Bones\\", produced by Joni Mitchell's ex, Larry Klein.  She has built a career on interpreting the works of other people.  Her sensitive, exquisite voice, reminiscent of the great jazz singers of our yesterdays has added her signature 'postmodernist coolness' (LA Times) and fresh brushstrokes to the work of artists including Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams and Serge Gainsbourg.  \\"Bare Bones\\" is her 4th solo album and her third with Rounder Records.  It's her most personal, intimate and almost confessional album: she had a hand in writing  all the 11 tracks, including collaborations with producer Larry Klein, Walter Becker, Julian Coryell, Joe Henry, David Batteau and Sean Wayland : her intimate readings of original and contemporary love songs evoke emotions laid bare.  It's a daring high-wireact for the 34-year-old singer who for the first time is working without the safety net of covering songs associated with her favourite musical acts, mostly from the past.  With \\"Bare Bones\\", Maddie  has crafted her best album yet, an artistic breakthrough that finds her sublime voice wrapped around a collection of soulful, silky late-night songs  that she helped craft from their inception, marking her evolution as a songwriter. One song, \\"I Must Be Saved\\", was written entirely by Peyroux.  While the surface of the songs she sings has an easy-listening quality, there are chasms of emotional turmoil lurking beneath.  She says the album builds from wariness, to loss, to acceptance, and finally to hope.   \\"I'm really happy that I got to write\\", she adds, \\"It feels like a new segment, and it's great work. I'm surrounded by beautiful sounds, really honest musicians, really honest playing\\".  In fact, the musicianship is excellent: a small group of top notch artists underscore perfectly the languid and bluesy singing of the unusual diva: organist Larry Goldings, pianist Jim Beard, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, plus producer Klein on bass, his new wife, Brazilian Luciana Souza - who, by the way, is a guest on all Larry Klein produced albums -  on bckgr vocals, Dean Parks on guitar, and Carla Kihlstedt on violin.  \\"It's an exhilarating mixture of fear and self-confidence, in a way...And, obviously, because I am a very new writer, I'm kind of discovering myself by watching audiences' takes on this stuff\\".  She will always be a busker. Her bohemian upbringing ensures it. Her eschewing of the trappings of celebrity proves it.  And maybe this time around as well, sometimes soon she will vanish just to resurface some days later in another corner of her world.  \\"Peyroux's soul and melting voice stands out, ways out, from the pack\\". - TimeOut  Maddie, who said she spent time in a domestic violence shelter as a child, is donating $1 from every ticket sold on her current tour to local charities affiliated with the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.   My favourite tracks: \\"Instead\\", \\"River of Tears\\", \\"You Can't Do Me\\", \\"Love and Treachery\\" and \\"Something Grand\\", which she wrote \\"in support of the new era with Barack Obama\\".  [[ASIN:B000O1712K Oceana]]  Update.  The album debuts at # 1 of Billboard Top Jazz Album.  Issue date: 2009-03-28

I was hoping to at least resolve the issue as to wheather the Fool is a woman, (dissapointing), or a man. As much as I like Robin Hobb's work, I found myself saying, \\"just what the heck was that chapter about?\\". The character plots meander all over the place, the story line seems to bog down with too many loose ends, awaiting book three. I managed to finish it, because of my devotion to Hobb, and anticipate satisfying endings to all the issues in book three. Having said that, If you like Hobb, you will find enough to make this a satisfying, if skimpy meal.

B000GGSMB2|5.0|Brian DePalma has never been known for his subtlety, and Oliver Stone was just beginning his career as a screen-writer of kerosene soaked volatility. In 1983, when they released the violently over-the-top \\"Scarface,' a lot of film-goers didn't know what to make of it. Hundreds of F-Words and thousands of gunshots in the life of a Cuban Drug Lord outraged the Cuban community and offended the morally fragile. Yet some 25 years later, Al Pacino's burning portrayal of Tony Montana continues to resonate. And there has not been a Gangster movie made since that doesn't owe to \\"Scarface's\\" legacy. Like [[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]] or [[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather]], \\"Scarface\\" redefined the way this stlye of movie is made and viewed.<br /><br />Perhaps the bizarre affinity gangster rappers have for this has overwhelmed the actual film's content (dudes, Tony becomes an impotent paranoid man before his inevitable bloody end), but the look of the film is amazing. \\"Scarface\\" takes its time and comes to a boil ever so slowly as Tony first lands in \\"Freedomtown\\" before he starts to climb to the top. Despite the hype of the violence, much of the actual death and destruction is implies (the infamous chainsaw sequence in particular), and Tony even tries to cling to a certain moral code. Murdering an enemy is fine, but not the enemy's kids.<br /><br />DePalma also sticks to a filmatic elegance, allowing cameras slow-pans and eschewing rapid cut editing, while also infusing the film with stabs of humor. (Personal favorite, the job offer in Frank's car dealership.) The color scheme is strictly tied to its time; colors will make you flashback to old Miami Vice episodes and Giorgi Moroder's score just screams \\"dated.\\" (However, the [[ASIN:B0000UX4XA Soundtrack]] does include one exquisite Debbie Harry single.) Given DePalma's legendary fight with the ratings board over the violence and language, he could have easily clipped the film down from its near three hour running time, but he held his ground and delivered the movie he wanted. Love it or hate it, \\"Scarface\\" is a visionary movie that has deservedly left its mark.and delivered the movie he wanted.

0375703764|5.0|In the apartment of a dead man, Johnny Truant discovers a manuscript by Zampan&ograve;, an academic study of a documentary called The Navidson Record in which journalist Navidson finds an impossible endless hallway within his house. Interweaving the events of the documentary with Zampan&ograve; and Truant's interjections, with copious footnotes, an unusual layout, and lengthy appendixes, House of Leaves is self-referential post-modern Lovecraftian horror which is as intriguing as it is pretentious. This novel must be read to believed, and it's a long journey not without faults, but I recommend it enthusiastically.<br /><br />There are three stories here: Truant's life and past, the lingering hints of Zampan&ograve;'s life, and Navidson's long journey into the endless bowels of his house. If that weren't enough, the text lies in columns and narrow blocks that mimic the house's hallways, words and passages appear in odd colors, and the footnotes have footnotes and reference books which don't exist. In short, House of Leaves has a lot going on, and it is an odd and a bold book from the first page. Reading it can be a labor--but it is a labor of love, because it offers so much.<br /><br />In the vein of Lovecraft, House of Leaves is not the horror of ghosts or scary images, but rather the horror of the endless and terrifying unknown. Via some wonderful storytelling and the unusual layout Truant and the reader are dragged along through Navidson's explorations, and are frightened and threatened in turn. Books never scare me, but this one did--and for that alone I would recommend it. But House of Leaves offers more than just terror. The journey into the house is also a journey into the self, and it pushes explorers to their limits. As such, the book has a surprisingly strong human element--one which is a bit too present at the end, where the horror is exchanged for a resolution between Navidson and his wife. This was my least favorite part, and makes for a slow conclusion. Still, on the whole, the book is a careful combination of atmospheric Lovecraftian horror and delicate human exploration, and it succeeds at both.<br /><br />Be willing to wade through footnotes, to flip to the appendix, to turn the book upside down and on edge; enjoy and find humor in the self-aware pretentious post-modernism; be fascinated the horror of the endless, incomprehensible unknown--and you will love this book. I did, nearly every word of it, and so I cannot recommend it highly enough. It may not be the book for everyone and it is not without fault, but it is undeniably brave and I only wish we saw more books like it. The endless dark inspires wonder and awe and fear, and when we look into it we will never escape the memory of what we see. At least, I hope not. I hope (and expect) that this book will stay with me forever.a careful combination of atmospheric Lovecraftian horror and delicate human exploration, and it succeeds at both.

B00127RAJY|4.0|30 day shred provides an intense workout. I used to be very athletic but stopped working out about six months ago because of a very busy schedule. I recently decided I had enough and it was time to start working out again in whatever little time I had. After some research I decided to go with Jillian's 30 day shred. It was a good decision. Some reviewers said she doesn't explain or give good instructions - which is untrue - she stops explains every move (sometimes too much)   As many have said its a really tough workout. I thought level 1 was a killer but realized that in less then a week I was ready to move to level 2. Level 2 was even more difficult and I am still trying to master it.   I don't think that this workout is not for beginners - a beginner might just need to spend more time on level 1 then someone who is more advanced.   Jillian gives a really intense workout in a very short amount of time.   The reason I went with 4 starts instead of 5 is because I haven't lost as much weight as I thought I would. I have looked to other users to see if they have similar results and it seems that in order to really lose weight with shred you need to supplement it with some other workout (seems cardio works best.)

B000002J03|5.0|That is a very bold statement, but in my eyes, this is the ultimate Led Zeppelin experience.  While Led Zeppelin I is more pioneering, Led Zeppelin 4 is more acclaimed, and the double album Physical Graffiti is considered a masterwork and concise and heck, this is the ultimate Led Zeppelin experience.  If you could have only one Led Zeppelin album, it would be this one.    Why is that?  Now don't get me wrong, I love Led Zeppelin and they are one of my favorite artists, and I think those albums I mentioned rule, as well.  But even those albums may have had some problems, such as Led Zeppelin 4 being somewhat of a sacred cow (please tell me why songs such as Misty Mountain Hop, ), not to mention some of the silly mythology themes the band delved into during their later years.  And while their debut was an electrifying slab of sex-filled rock and roll, some of the songwriting was spotty.  This album features none of this.    This album is musical goodness, and a monster when it comes to rocking.  Jimmy Page's guitar riffs are off the hook, as he is the master, and you will be humming them for days.  Jimmy Page's guitar solos also are testament that Jimmy Page is the master.  And while their have been guitarists more technical than Page (not to mention there are plenty of aspiring guitarist who can play this stuff note from note), I doubt any guitarist could play with the feeling Jimmy Page did.  There is John Bonham, one of my favorite drummers.  It's not even worth to mention what kind of things he plays underneath, and the feeling of him is unmatched.  John Paul Jones and Robert Plant also follow suite, and they play with absolute confidence here.  Rock and roll doesn't get better than this!    The album kicks off with Whole Lotta Love, the most well known song on this album.  And what a song!  Starting out with the anthem riff, it pounds it's way through rhythms and cool buzzing guitars.  The Breakdown here is really trippy, and you're in for a treat when the firstsong is not even the best!  What Is and What Will Never Be is seriously underrated, with a rad bass line underneath the soft swagger and the bluesy guitar solo.  The Lemon Song has some of the best drumming around, and the guitar solos here rip, then grunt out the blues.  It's a masterful song, and my pick for the most underrated song in the Led Zeppelin catalog (really!).  Thank You takes a break and shows the diversity of Led Zeppelin, delivering a heartfelt ballad with being sappy, cheesy, or maudlin.    Heartbreaker is the centerpiece.  It begins with the catchiest riff that will stick in your head for days, then features some rowdy siren wails backed by rumbling, menacing bass.  The solo in the middle for me represents how great Jimmy Page really was, it will make you say \\"AWWWWW YEAH!\\"  It's synch in rules too, which is easily the most fun song on the album.  Ramble On's folk influence works wonders in making the mythology theme come to life.  Listen this subtle bass line that rambles beneath the music too.   And Moby Dick? Well, I must say that this was one of the best songs when I heard it.  It's mostly a drum solo, and impressive one at that, but the beginning and ending feature some of Jimmy Page (and the whole bands) funkiest chops.  This one is an absolute blast to listen too, and especially if you play an instrument, or, as most rock fans, an air instrument.   The bluesy Bring It on Home brings the record on home with a dose of cool delta blues and all out rowdiness.    Absolutely essential rock music.  This is why some of us Led Zeppelin fans really stand by this band as a rock legend.

I had no idea what it was about, but wanting to read the book before seeing the movie, I picked it up and read it. What happened was the first in a chain of events that has led me down paths that have made me who I am now. At 45, I once again read this book and am equally moved and thrilled to realize that life, like a skater's languid figure eight, has come back again to a place it once was. Like that same person with barely two decades of life under his belt: single, without care, drifting in life without purpose, career calling, or direction, my purpose is as uncertain as it was so long ago. So, now what? Well, that remains to be seen.<br />The Razor's Edge is a book that I wish everyone would read at some time in their life, if only to encounter Larry Darrell, one of the most remarkable people in literature and a man to whom each of us should pledge to aspire, if only for a little while. How much better would life be if we were to simply eschew material goods for spiritual discovery or see the grace and glory in doing things for others for the sheer joy of helping out and being the best that we can be? Is there a more important issue to ponder in our lives than what our purpose is and who is the truest and most worthwhile person we can be? This classic novel, easy to read and yet remarkable thoughtful and full of deep human understanding, gives us Larry and lets us judge not only his actions, but our own in contrast. The Razor's Edge is nothing short of my field book for life, a reminder of what I know to be true, right, and decent, and the talisman to keep me on the path towards hope, enlightenment, and being the man I was intended to be.<br />Towards the end of the book, Larry explains, \\"It's strange how many people suffer from (fear). I don't mean fear of closed spaces and fear of heights, but fear of death and, what's worse, fear of life.\\" I have come to understand that the battle with fear is a part of life. This book, like all of the cherished lessons and experiences in life, is a crucial ally in that on-going engagement.ath and, what's worse, fear of life.\\" I have come to understand that the battle with fear is a part of life.

0930289234|5.0|I first read Watchmen in 2002 and I recently picked up the Absolute Edition and it was just as amazing as the first time I read it.<br /><br />I read a lot of different novels and comics and I have to say that Watchmen is definitely one of my favorite books. There's so many things I love about this book that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll just list them out:<br /><br />-I like how Moore presents you with all of these different characters with different viewpoints and lets you choose who you want to side with.<br />-I also like how Alan Moore weaves together all of these different ideas, like how he mixes real life events into this alternate time line where superheroes existed.<br />-This book really uses the comic book medium to its full potential. Alan Moore's scenes are just so incredibly well thought out and Dave Gibbons is just so adept at getting in all of those little details. There's so many little things I didn't pick up on the first time I read this. When I started reading this the first time, the art didn't really connect with me. I think after I read the first chapter I realized just how amazing it is. I don't know how to explain it. Everything just looks really perfect. Gibbons has a really nice style and just nails every scene.<br />-Unlike a lot of other superhero comics, you can actually have some sort of emotional investment in these characters. Partly because they're more realistic and also because you know that they can actually die and not be brought back.<br />-The Absolute Edition and all current editions of the book have been recolored by original colorist John Higgins and I have to say he did a really great job on this. The original colors were a bit too bright and a little sloppily done. The colors here have been cleaned up and are more subdued.<br />-And, of course, you know, the story and characters are awesome.<br /><br />When I think about it, it is really just amazing that this comic even exists. I don't understand why people always compare this to The Dark Knight Returns, which came out at the same time. To me, Watchmen is a much better book. Watchmen makes you think; Dark Knight Returns makes you think about Batman (but don't get me wrong, I still think Dark Knight Returns is very well done). I just think we're really lucky that Moore and Gibbons, these two incredibly dedicated (or maybe obsessive?) artists hooked up. Watchmen is better than we as a people deserve.

1400063515|1.0|Taleb manages to be boring, arrogant, and uninformative - all at the same time.<br /><br />A Black Swan is a highly improbable event that is unpredictable, has a massive impact, and after the fact, we invent an explanation that makes it appear more predictable than it was. A small number of Black Swans explain almost everything in our world. The rise of Hitler and the subsequent war, the precipitous demise of the Soviet bloc, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, the spread of the Internet, and 9/11 all follow Black Swan dynamics.<br /><br />Alternatively, one could say that much of \\"The Black Swan\\" criticizes for inability to forecast the future. He's not the first - Jack Welch of G.E. famously scrapped his company's extensive planning procedure for just that reason, instead choosing to focus on fast reaction. Others, including General Eisenhower, have made similar comments about war, etc.<br /><br />Taleb goes on to claim that globalization is good for the U.S. because we obtain the largest benefits of manufacturing - eg. shoe design. Tell that to the thousands of U.S. shoemakers now unemployed, or the shoe designers who soon will be replaced by Asians using software and computers.<br /><br />On business leaders, \\"being an executive does not require very developed frontal lobes, but rather a combination of charisma, a capacity to sustain boredom, and the ability to shallowly perform on harrying schedules.  Adding to these tasks the \\"duty\\" of attending opera performances\\" shows an incredible ignorance of what separates successful from unsuccessful leaders.<br /><br />And on and on and on.<br /><br />How should one prepare for, avoid being fooled by black swans? Taleb doesn't say.
B00006AVRK|2.0|Jeeves & Wooster is an awesomely funny series. Sadly, A&E just can't seem to put out a decent quality product. Everything I've purchased from them is lousy video quality.    It's as if they farmed it out to some low budget duplication house to save a few pennies on the cost of goods. In reality they're only cementing their reputation as a company that doesn't care about their customers. Do some Googling and you'll find a lot of complaints about the quality of their products.    How sad that a company that produces such great entertainment doesn't take the same care in producing their video products.
0385340990|5.0|What a great book! It is wonderfully written and pulls the reader directly into the story.  The letter format was easy to read, but very captivating.  I didn't want this book to end.  The writers account of the aftermath of WWII is slipped in so subtly that you may not recognize you are receiving a history lesson.  Touching and romantic, I am so glad this book was recommended to me by a friend.

015626224X|3.0|The book begins with the main character, aguably Orwell himself, living modestly in a cheap Paris boarding house on an insufficient income teachin English. The main character watches his funds slowly dwindle, until he finds himself submerged in the world of poverty, in which he exists often on the brink of starvation from then on. His last experience in Paris is his work as a plongeur in a restaurant with a 17-hour daily work schedule, where a reader is given a sobering view of the restaurant business in Paris, 1928. The narrator then returns to his native country of England for a job -- one he ends up having to wait three months for. During these three months, the main character lives the demoralizing life as a tramp in London.    This is only the second Orwell book I had read after 1984. I selected it from a list of books to write a paper on as to whether or not it should be taught in a high school English class. Though I adore Orwell, that answer was a decided \\"no.\\"     I jumped from reading Orwell's last work, to his first work, which I expected to be an exciting novel. It almost seemed that way in the first part of the book, when he's in Paris. I kept reading in hopes of learning something about the character, in hopes that something would happen and we would see him work his way up from his poverty. But there was no plot because this is no novel. So much of the book is based on factual accounts and observations that it borders on non-fiction. The book is not considered a biography though, because throughout the entirety of the book, nothing is learned about Orwell himself as far as his character, personality, or even past experiences or future desires. Down and Out is a work of pure observation of reality interrupted only on occasion with commentary of the current European society of the time. As an unconvential novel, there are no developed characters, symbolism, manipulations of language, or abstract themes for readers to think on. The book is what it is.The book's true value is that it is considered to be a predecessor to new journalism and a historical work that readers may find educational. For what it is, it is finely crafted and somewhat enjoyable. It's not hard to read once you surrender to the fact that nothing is really going to happen in terms of character development or resolution. The book is eye-opening in a historical sense. It won't really teach you anything about poverty today. It will however, leave you with a sense of what it really means to be \\"down and out\\" though and ultimately a sense of gratitude for your own life.     The bottom line: I'm not sorry I read it. It was very educational and gave me a view into Orwell's world before I set off to read the rest of my favorite author's works. (I just finished Keep the Aspidistra Flying and LOVED it.) I recommend it to any writer, journalist, or individual interested in history or that wants a background to the world Orwell lives to supplement his other works. If you, however, were looking for an exciting novel with characters and themes galore, pass it up.
0553103547|2.0|This one wild fantasy type story.  I have heard that there is some game evolved from this saga.  Wonderful!!  I was distressed that the good guys were so apparent and that has led me to feel like I am just waiting for the end to see who is left standing, good or bad.<br /> I like that way he setup the story: the characters are given chapters so you can follow their life as it unfolds.  The physical world they inhabit is not ours, of course, and there is some magic out there, so later on the magic, like 'Doc Savage,' (who I have never read, only heard about) will make a dramatic entrance and solve everyone's problem and the good guys will win.<br /> Ho, hum, but I will read it to the end so I find out who wins, et al.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|First off, let me say, in my mind Let The Right One In is the best movie of 2008 ... period! That said, the DVD release is NOT the theatrical version!!! Read the other reviews if you would like to know what it's about but I want to make a quick comment on the DVD.<br /><br />First off, the english dubbing is a joke. Turn it off and go with the subtitles. Thre dubbing takes aways from the story and is almost laughable.<br /><br />Next, the subtitles are not correct and much is left out!!!! If you watched the trailer you see Oskar ask Eli to be his girlfriend ... a sweet moment between 2 tweleve year old kids ... in this version, the subtitle reads ... 'Do I have a chance with you?\\" WHAT????? What 12 year old talks like that??? The subtitles get worse, and much is left out.<br /><br />I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater, and reviewed for several websites. I'm sad to say, this DVD is not that movie. By changing the subtitles, and actually removing dialogue, the story has lost much of it innocence and taken the viewer on a trip that is confusing at times ... I guess the the producers of this film didn't feel American Viewers could understand the simple beauty of this story and had to sreamlime the dialouge and make it more adult ... Shame on them!!! I'll be loooking for a European release to purchase ...
0307269752|4.0|This over-hyped mystery is still enjoyable, if a little unwieldy.  The crime being investigated has an almost comically over-populated slate of suspects, and we're introduced to a number of intriguing characters who are then never developed.  The revelation of the killer isn't particularly surprising either.  And for a book this long, the climax is certainly abrupt.  (Mark Billingham or Jeffrey Deaver could have teased that out for several chapters.)  Plus, we're then left with an additional 100 pages to wrap things up.  That said, the book unfolds with a mesmerizing charm similar to the fascinating if contrived title character.<br /><br />(The book's full of allusions to Thomas Harris, Val McDermid and others.  In fact, I felt the character of Henrik who sets the plot in motion owed something to Henry, Kinsey's aged neighbor in Sue Grafton's books.)
0312360266|5.0|I read this book in one day. Could not wait to read the next one in the series.
B001N26GFM|5.0|So I saw a preview for this movie a few months back and was very disappointed that the movie didn't come to a movie theater around me. So I rented the movie last night and it was superb!! I am a major WWII movie and history buff and was very glad to see a movie portray what it was like for the \\"kinder's\\" (kids) of that time. Those two little boys capture your heart and are excellent in their roles. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a heart!!   Enjoy!!~
B000002H17|3.0|Too Fast for Love is pretty good. Don't see how it could be anyone's favorite, but it's not bad. Listening to this album now, you can tell the band really matured greatly in their other albums.4 or 5 good songs are definitely worth the price.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Every single song in this album taps the deepest vein of raunchy, fun, dirty, low-down, bad-boy blues. Not only is this (in my opinion) AC/DC's best album ever, it may be the single best album ever produced. Trapped on a desert island - pick this as your one album. Every song is 10 out of 10. No matter who you are or how you see yourself, it makes you want to sneer and throw your fist up and give life a big middle finger, while screaming \\"is that all you got?\\"
B001GNRNQE|3.0|I loved Jennifer Hudson's performance in Dreamgirls, so I was excited that she was releasing an actual pop / contemprary CD. I finally listened to the first single when it came out and thought it was kind of bland. I thought she needed to go more in a direction of keyshia cole with her type of voice. I think she could have def. benifitted from this. It seemed like all the beats were weak, and the album version of if it isn't love doesn't really sound that good compared to the music video on tv and on the computer. I thought spotlight two was pretty dull, and pocketbook was ok. With the if it isn't love video, I can def. see that she has talent and that she could potentially make some great music, but as far as this goes she could have done a much better job! TOO GENERIC! If your an R & B fan you might want to consider wasting your hard earned money on this,maybe....
B000089RV6|5.0|There's really nothing to be said that has not already. They have never followed trend, never wavered, never pandered. AC/DC simply makes the best rock and roll ever - bar none. They are (as of now) the fifth best selling band ever. And they don't even put out albums very frequently now. There is a total and complete honesty in what they do and people sense it - no pretension, no lofty ambition. People like AC/DC because they identify with them. I'm not gonna explain it as 'common man' or any other bull crud explanation - its just solid blues based rock - dirty, fun, and basic. Both Scott and Johnson have a rough voice to go with the rough music - that feel, that sound, has got me through many a difficult moment in life. I hope they never stop.
B001POAVZE|3.0|Don't know any of the title tracks but I thought this cd was very enjoyable to listen to. I think Franz Ferdinand did a great job of trying to follow the trends without trying to sound to corny. I thought most of the cd was pretty good and you could def. play it at a party. After reading rolling stone magaizine they said they worked with Kylie Minogue's people. I was def. curious to hear what kind of sound they were going to produce. I think they did an excellent job with her people. I will say that The Gossip, Killers, and Yeah Yeah yeahs do a better job with the whole techonrock thing.
0345457684|4.0|Altered Carbon is a tribute to the glory days of cyberpunk.  The novel recalls Phillip K. Dick in tone and William Gibson in style.  On the surface this is a gritty murder mystery filled with characters both subtle and monstrous.  However, like Phillip K. Dick, the story delves into the grey area between two states of being.  In this case it is the dichotomy between the physical self and the psychological self.  In this future, death has been eliminated through the adoption of a technology called a stack that records the self onto a micro chip made of altered carbon.  As long as the chip is not damaged, a person's stack can be downloaded after the body has died and then loaded into another body or sleeve.  The implications of this technology, both physical and psychological, are the engine that drives this story.    It all begins when a rich man dies and his stack is completely destroyed.  A backup of his stack is sleeved into a cloned body and he hires Takeshi Kovacs to investigate the cause of his death.  The police believe that it was a suicide so he brings in Kovacs, who is highly trained in both deductive logic and martial arts.  He is a mercenary who is currently serving time in a prison on a distant planet.  He is downloaded into a rented body on Earth with the promise of amnesty if he can solve the mystery.  Although the evidence indicates suicide, Kovacs knows that something is wrong since people keep trying to kill him.    The story moves along at a fast clip through the highest and lowest strata of society.  There are many exciting gun battles, knife fights, and unarmed brawls.  The futuristic technology is believable, although most of it revolves around sex, drugs, and firearms.  Like Warren Ellis' Transmetropolitan, this future has devolved to a state where almost any act of sex, violence or intoxication is socially acceptable.  However, this story lacks the humor of Transmetropolitan so its fascination with sexual deviancy comes across as prurient.  There are multiple scenes where the passages seemed to be taken directly from a copy of Penthouse Letters.  These graphic depictions of sex are both distracting and unnecessary.  Overall a good work of cyberpunk style science-fiction, which loses points for being overly violent and sexual.
B001FXCE46|4.0|A friend got me into Kings of Leon and i listened to this cd. And thought it was a really good rock album. I really liked the beats and the singers lead voice.

B00005JPY2|4.0|\\"The Watchmen\\" is an in-your-face, anarchic, riotous, almost diabolic film based on the much loved Alan Moore graphic novel. Much has been made of whether this story could or should be filmed, but give Zach Snyder, the cast, and a great script credit because they pulled off an amazing coup. In an era of huge box-office receipts for superheroes movies, this movies takes a big bite out of the hand that is well feeding Hollywood. The heroes found in the Watchmen are not only human (with one noticeable exception), but are psychotic, neurotic, unnecessarily violent, pretentious, self-absorbed, and downright evil.<br /><br />The death of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), one of a former superhero group called the Watchmen, spurs Rorschach, another former member (played by Jackie Earle Haley and easily the best performance in the film) to investigate, and he starts on a trail that quickly ensnares the other former Watchmen - Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), and the most powerful of all, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a hyper-sentient being who control matter as a result of a horrible lab accident.<br /><br />The time is an alternate universe in the year 1985, where the US won the war in Vietnam, Richard Nixon is still president, and superheroes have been outlawed. This and the peverse way the film turns the superhero convention on its head lays the groundwork for a movie whose worldview is sometimes as paranoid, if not more so, than Rorschach, whose suspicious nature and malevolence seems symbolic for the world he fights so hard to protect. As is the Comedian, seen in flashbacks as anything but heroic, and who seems to stand for something perceived as heroic, when in fact, heroism is an excuse to perpetrate violence.<br /><br />This film, regardless of comparisons to Alan Moore's work, stands alone as a great film. Gory, gritty, uncompromising, yet strangely hopeful, The Watchmen is a great film for those who want their superheroes dark and dank.and dank.
B001KQKC0Q|4.0|This CD is in constant rotation at my fraternity! This album has a great beats, a great voice, and sounds like decent rock music! I downloaded the album and listened to it after the photograph album! So figured this one will propably be just as good if not better. I thought Gotte Be somebody is an excellent song.SEX is a really fun song to listen to. I really enjoy this cd all the way through. I think they are currently the best rock band that's current on top of the pop charts.
B00005JKC3|3.0|The only thing good about this movie were the fight scenes. Everything else was so-so. \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" was so much better!
B0019O0W90|3.0|It's not like this album totally sucks,but let's be honest, I was never an usher fan to begin with. To me his music is def. meant more for women then men. So that intially turned me off. I thought love in this club was def. a disappointment, especially after Yeah! was really his only club type song that caught my attention. I thought he song well on this album, but thought neyo put alittle creativity into his cd. Which is why this album failed in my opinion. Usher's style is getting extremely old to me,and almost becoming outdated. Almost like Beyonce's voice until she decided to change. Usher really should try to take more after neyo and chris brown if he wants to stay current. Moving Mountains was ok, It seems like half of the tracks are forgettable. I personally wouldn't waste two cents on this cd, pick up neyo or mario's if you want great r & B.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Great movie. Much better than the first one. The storyline for this movie was inexplicably better than the first Hulk film. Well worth your viewing!
1400063515|4.0|The author's mind, and subsequently his writing, meanders like a hyperactive 7 year old. He talks about everything from wars in the middle east to prostitutes, rats, and investment bankers in Manhattan. Oh yes, he also does talk of swans that could be black, but not before he talks of turkeys and how much a cab driver loved his $100 tip back in the 80s.<br /><br />I would have given this book one or two stars for its total lack of focus and extremely wordy writing style. But the author is also a undeniable genius and the book has high level intellectual analysis. I just wish the author had taken a pill to calm down his apparent attention deficit disorder (ADD).<br /><br />The author slams the bell curve (standard statistical analysis) and the standard deviation. He calls them the Great Intellectual Fraud (GIF) precisely because the bell curve takes out the black swans of data. The black swan is an event which is far from probable, but is also far from impossible. Black swans are the extremities of data. Surprisingly, black swans show up far more in our daily lives than the regular statistical analysis would indicate.<br /><br />So what do we learn from this? NO ONE can predict the future on anything with regularity. Expect the unexpected. Luck plays greater role in our lives than we think, especially when it comes to extremities (extreme wealth, extreme success, extreme failures etc). The information age has brought us even more extremities. If you are not ultratalented and knowledgeable of your craft, then stick to a non-scalable (paid by the hour) pay rate.

But After Getting Wet, The Nasty Green Monsters Are on The Loose in Clamp INC. and Causing Mistif and Mayham All Over Again. But Insted of Having The Same Monsterus Maham Monsters Like in The First Film, The Gremlins Have Diffrent Porsinalties, Such as A Daffy Gremlin, Spider Gremlin, and A Brain Gremlin (Brilliantly Voiced By Tony Randall). Now Billy, Kate, Mr. Futterman, and Gizmo Must Distroy These Diffrent Prosanalaty Gremlins in One Big Building in New York.    GREMLINS 2 is As Great and Possably Better Than The Origanal Horror-Classic Released in 1984. Most of The Fun Comes From The Diffrent Porsanality Gremlins in The Sequel and The Best In My Opinon is THE BRAIN GREMLIN Voiced By Tony Randall.Gizmo is Even More Fun Than Ever When He Tries Turning To His Favorite Action Hero RAMBO.    The Action in The Fist Film Was More Horror-Like and Scary. The Action in The Second Film is More Comicly Horror-Like Than Scary, and The Sequel Just Makes It More Fun To Watch.    The Best Moment in This Horror-Sequel is When The Gremlins Take Over The Clamp INC. Lobby and The Brain Gremlin is Singing ''New York, New York'' (Which I Wished It Was On The Soundtrack, But Sadly It Isn't).    Overall, Gremlins 2 is A Must-See Sequel, and It Seceseds On What Over Sqequels Fail At, and That's Making It As Fun and Possibly Better Than The Origanal.

1563898586|5.0|It seems that Alan Moore is the creator extraordinaire of the development of the alternate history genre of graphic novels.<br /> In his highly entertaining series of \\"The League of extraordinary Gentlemen\\", Mr. Moore has captured a team of eclectic characters roaming the world in the existence of the British Empire during the late Victorian era.<br /> This amalgamation of rather odd characters who all possess alternate personalities serves as a rather odd basis of a team supposedly meant to be the vanguard of good against the forces of evil.<br /> In this first book, we see the original formation of this league of strange characters.  We learn of their good and bad habits.  Mr. Moore utilizes British fiction writing into the characters and the essence of his alternative history.  For instance he uses the fictional Plantagenet Palliser as Prime Minister in 1898.  His use of this character is highly entertaining and I might add was utilized by Moore with tongue in cheek.  His use of Prime Minister Palliser doesn't correctly coincide with the fictional time period as created by the original author.<br /> In totality this graphic novel excels in all respects.  The writing is of the highest caliber as is the artwork and graphics.  It does also break the Moore mold of creating a dark graphic novel.  This novel is indeed light and at times comic.  Just by looking at the cover of volume one makes me chuckle!<br /> Highly recommended!!!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Who would've thought the Beatles would be revived in the 21st century with a double disc album with a large cast of musical unknowns - and more importantly, with their music legacy and sound kept intact?  This really is an epic task - when one considers the quality of the work. Covering the Beatles may seem easy, but to do it well is anything but.<br /><br />A caveat - soundtracks absolutely work best when you remember the movies.  And people who buy this album should really watch the movie for the visual experience first.  It forges a new chapter in Beatles history - if just a relatively small step for the new generation.  There isn't much of a note or interpretation out of place here.  What works is the blend of voices and styles - from the young (Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Woods), to black gospel (Carol Woods / Timothy Mitchum), to the seasoned rocker (Joe Cocker) to r & b (the amazing Martin Luther McCoy)<br /><br />It's a little melancholy for me when one considers that the Beatles are no longer with us but what a legacy.<br /><br />Note: get the 2 disc edition - not the very unsatisfying single disc edition which I got and now have to give away!
B001NFNFIK|5.0|Never even heard of the books - maybe that's a good thing: no expectations. It seems fitting that a French director did such a wonderful, spare, tight film about Louisiana. Nothing sentimental - just all the ingredients of a Civil War that has never really ended, tragically flawed history, and characters that you love & respect even while seeing huge flaws.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|Very bad,boring poor acting I wasted my money!!!Oscars nomination?Well I guess if you put in the movie oppressed blacks and racial discrimination 90% of the time you will get a nomination,it becames just poor taste regurgitating all the same...time for healing yet???
B000OPOAJS|2.0|The picture quality is fine on this blu-ray disc but be warned, there are no extras. MGM released a standard DVD 2 disc set of Ronin with very good extras, but then go and release a film only version on blu-ray, at twice the cost. A blu-ray disc could easily fit all the bonus material. Hold off on buying this and wait for a special edition.

I ordered several things on amazon at the same time, this was the first of my order that arrived, days before the rest. Great.
1569242739|5.0|We aren't vegans, but my daughter has an egg allergy so I covet egg-free baking recipes that are actually good.  Most are not, frankly, and most totally vegan baking I have tried is just a step up from sawdust.  My friend (whose sons have a dairy allergy) recommended this book, and we just tried the mocha cupcakes with coffee frosting.  We were shocked that they were some of the best cupcakes I'd ever had!  Easy, too, and no strange ingredients (like that nasty ener-g egg replacer).  There is a great variety here, and there are even some gluten-free recipes for the wheat-allergic or celiacs in your life.  We have a bunch of family birthdays coming up, and I'm having fun trying to decide what to make next.  The vegan buttercream frosting is really excellent- you will never know it's not dairy-based.    If you are avoiding egg or dairy for any reason, I would highly recommend this book- you won't be sorry!
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Set on the campus of conservative Wellesley College in 1953-1954, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is a story of gender roles, art, and romance.<br /><br />An interesting and fast-paced story with great potential, were attention given to historic detail, but instead it stays within the the romantic comedy genre most familiar to Julia Roberts fans.  Roberts plays the new non-traditional art history teacher who challenges the Wellesley girls beyond their expected gender roles.<br /><br />Although convincing in other scenes, Roberts is less convincing as a college teacher, and many of the other characters are almost caricatures, not believable as real personalities.  The rudeness is often exaggerated, and although the background is indeed of the 1950s, somehow it is not convincingly presented.  It comes across as a 2003 film with a 1950s theme.<br /><br />If not critically analyzed, however, it is a light and interesting feel-good film with the added bonus of a little gender role history, a little art history, and a little romance, as was most likely its intention.

1439102813|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Still Alice\\" and have to say that it has to be one of my favorite books. It was very easy to read and I probably finished it in less than 3 days. Alzheimer's is already very tragic, but then when you stop and think about what early-on set Alzheimers can do to people in their 30s through 50s, it is even more maddening. It has been a while since I've read a book that I couldn't put down and I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Alice next. I thought the book was well-written, including the subtle things that the author would include illustrating how Alice was slowly losing her battle. I highly recommend this book!

B0000VCZKM|5.0|A great movie for the whole family if one can overlook the overacting by the cast which actually consists of some very fine actors and actresses. Aileen Quinn as Annie is adorable and does a great acting job. My family representing 3 generations - children, parents and grandparents - had a wonderful time watching this together. The two children, ages 5 and 8, are very sensitive and get easily scared by scary scenes, even in so-called family movies. But this one they greatly enjoyed, sitting on the edge of the sofa because of the suspense but not getting scared or traumatized. This is a true feel good movie for all ages.

1400063515|4.0|If Peter Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods\\" were a chronicle of mankind's attempt to tame uncertainty, Taleb's work is a great expositions of the failures in that attempt.  While the presentation of ideas can definitely be improved, the central ideas are quite valuable.  The central claim is that what is considered as \\"extreme\\" events occur a lot more common than people perceive.  The reasons for that are manifold.  What I find most interesting is the human need to rationalize and attach a story to what happened in the past, and then attempt to use it for future guidance.  The fallibility of this approach is manifest in the financial markets now.  The author certainly has many flaws, poor writing, bad examples, generally unclear exposition and an almost juvenile taunting of academics being some among them.  Yet you can tell the author has thought hard about many of the issues of the practice of modelling and predictions and his ideas are to be considered very seriously.  I view this book almost as the exact polar opposite of any of Malcolm Gladwell's writings such as \\"Blink.\\"  It is poorly written yet has many important ideas.
B000E8NQUE|3.0|So far I've gotten two of the Moodies best releases on SACD - this and Children's Children with 4 more more ( Future Passed to Every Good Boy are my favorites ) on the way. These recordings are kind of a \\"guilty pleasure\\" for me. Why?    Even when I got these as a high schooler in the early 70s, the Moody Blues seemed kind of cheesy compared to a lot of the other music I like ( King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Frank Zappa...) Hearing this last night - after a 35+ year hiatus - confirms a lot of things I felt so many years ago.     On the plus side, there are some tunes that have held up very well and - not surprisingly perhaps - they are the tunes that appealed to me when I first bought the album. Dear Diary ( with it's fluffed ensemble entry in one of the breaks ) and Lazy Day are evocative and don't sound so dated to me. Lovely to See You and Never Comes the Day are two of Justin Hayward's better tunes and like much of his output on these classic albums, still have the power to connect on an emotional level. Although not on this album, Watching and Waiting is the premier example of this emotional reach for me. Have You Heard sounds good too.    On the debit side: Some of the more \\"experimental\\" things like In The Beginning and The Voyage sound almost unbearably naive now. I'm sure this is a reflection of where I'm at. It has been said that \\" the reviewer reviews himself\\" and I think this is quite true. One thing that always bugged me about the Moody Blues is that the falsetto singing in the higher register sounds corny. 35+ years have not been kind to this aspect particularly. John Lodges tunes on this album are completely forgettable ( although I like Candle of Life from Children's Children ). I actually didn't remember them at all....    I'm finding that going back and listening to these Moody Blues recordings is a complex experience for me. I can't help feeling a certain nostalgia and yet I hear them as the listener that I am now - informed by many years ofplaying and listening to all kinds of music. The SACD production of the two I have is superb and has a lot to do with why I'm purchasing these remasters to begin with. I haven't bought any of this music since the original vinyl - now long gone.    All in all, I recommend the SACD remasters of the Moody Blues classic recordings to anyone who likes or liked them. I'm finding the experience of rediscovering them to be interesting, fun and sometimes surprising.

It is wonderful to hear the evolution of MJ's voice throughout the entire collection. My CD skips as well on the second disk around the song \\"Dangerous.\\" Must be a manufacturing issue.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Its been over six months since Metallica released their newest album, Death Magnetic.  I've been waiting patiently during that time span to see how my feelings towards the album would evolve.  Honestly, I loved St. Anger (Metallica's previous album) when it first released, and I'm unashamed to admit that my initial impressions were not lasting ones.  Just like in all other aspects of life, feelings change.    How I feel about Death Magnetic, though, has not changed.  Ever since the tempo picked up in That Was Just Your Life, a minute and thirty seconds into the very first song, I've been madly in love with the album.  The vocals, the solos, the tempo changes, the overall tone of the album, everything is near perfection, something that hasn't been said about Metallica in nearly seventeen years.     Rather than go into a song by song review, I'd like to explore what makes Death Magnetic stand out as an album.  Countless catchy and likable albums are released every year in all genres of music, but every once in a  while something comes out that can only be described as extraordinary.  A piece of work that has mass appeal, that doesn't limit itself to the confines defined by genres.     Death Magnetic is not that album.  Metallica (The Black Album), is that album.  Death Magnetic stands out because it offers the exact opposite of mass appeal.  It resides blissfully in its own genre, perfecting a formula in which Metallica created years ago.  This is thrash metal at its finest, and it's oh so good.  There's no question that Metallica unabashedly attempted to appeal to a very specific audience, and in that way created something very special.  Death Magnetic is a celebration of an entire genre.    Death Magnetic has been hyped as \\"the missing link between ...And Justice for All and Metallica\\", which is a little misleading.  Rather than being a return to their roots, this album is really a medley of all their styles over the past twenty five years.  There is a prevalent style that holds the album together though, and that's thrash.  Thrash Metal succeeds largely on fast and heavy guitar work combined with quick and aggressive vocals, all of which are very prominent in Death Magnetic.  As a fan of the genre, I get goosebumps listening to James Hetfield snarl \\"We Hunt you down without mercy!!  Hunt you down all nightmare long!!\\" while two guitars spin heavy riffs around each other, blocking out any moment of silence or respite, all while machine-gun double bass beats you over the head in the background.     Of course, the entire album isn't an adrenaline rush.  Songs like The Day That Never Comes and The Unforgiven III slow the pace for a bit, but never for long.  Both songs start slow but finish powerfully, almost as if Metallica is teasing the listener - you may want a moment to catch your breath, but they're not even close to being finished with you.    This is really indicative of the entire album.  While other bands would be satisfied building songs around three chords, Metallica includes a variety of riffs, each of which contains a number of chords, into each song.  This results in long, epic songs that never get tired or boring.  It's an amazing achievement to include a ten-minute instrumental that is just as fun to listen to as the lone five-minute song.    As I said before, Death Magnetic is not a masterpiece.  It falls short in two ways: its overall sound production and its lyrics.  I wont address the sound production problem, because it's purely technical (the music was mastered at high volume level), and in no part a fault of Metallica's.  The music is still great, and if it's that big of a problem to you, there are remastered torrents floating around the internet that solve the problem.  I'm not saying that you should download these... that would be illegal, and I'm sure it would make Lars mad... but the option is there.  I will address the lyrical problem though.    Prior to St. Anger, James Hetfield wrote all lyrical content, and although I doubt he won any poetry awards, it was solid, sometimes fantastic stuff.  When the infamous St. Anger was being developed, all members were included in the lyric creation process.  The result was an oversimplified approach, with awful and occasionally just plain dumb lyrics.  For Death Magnetic, James Hetfield has retaken sole lyrical duties, and while a major step forward from the previous album, the lyrics still fall short of his earlier work.  Sure there are some stand out moments on the album:  \\"I'll splatter color on this gray.\\"  \\"I've become your new god now.\\"  \\"Broken, beat, and scarred, we die hard!\\"  \\"Why can't I forgive me? \\"  Most of the lyrical content though is written like a parody of previous Metallica material.  The overarching theme here is death, tragedy, and redemption.  Really original, right?  Maybe a high school kid wearing eye-liner and writing morbid poetry would think this is deep, but for the rest of us it's just a tired convention of the genre.  Worst of all, the music doesn't fit in with the theme.  As James sings about the hardships of struggling with life in That Was Just Your Life, or the tragedy of being mutilated in a grotesque car accident in My Apocalypse, the tone of the music sounds upbeat, nearing the precipice of happiness.  In fact, every song on the album has a chest thumping celebration of life vibe to it.  Which I love, as it's a change from played-out genre norms, yet it becomes harder and harder to reconcile the differences between what Metallica wants you to take from the album, and what is taken from the album.  I don't see the album as a commentary on the fragility of life, but as a celebration of music by a band who after twenty five years finally understands what it is that makes them special.    When comparing Metallica albums, one always uses \\"the big three\\" as a reference point.  These big three being Ride the Lightening, Master of Puppets, and ...and Justice for All.  All three of these albumscan be considered the pinnacle of an entire genre of music and therefore a reference point for all other bands as well.  While I've loved Metallica in all of their forms, it would be unfair to say that I didn't hope that one day they would return to their big three form.  Death Magnetic is both that return and something more - it's an exploration of all the styles and struggles that they have gone through in a twenty five year career.  The album makes you thankful for all of the bands missteps, like St. Anger, because without those they wouldn't be were they are today.  There is no more \\"big three\\", but a \\"big four\\".  Metallica is once again the best rock band in music.
B001E75QGG|2.0|Here is a movie that was in development for well over ten years with dozens of scripts drafted and turned down by George Lucas himself.  I wonder if those scripts that were turned down actually worse than the one used or if Lucas and director Steven Spielberg were just set on making a UFO movie.  Whatever the answer may be the fact is \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a mess from beginning to end.    Yes, this is a mess right from the first shot.  As with the three previous Indiana Jones films the movie starts with Paramount logo mountain morphing into a mountain on screen, however, this time, they mountain is turned into a molehill.  Not only do we get a molehill, we get a critter crawling out of it.  And it's not just any critter, it's fake looking CGI critter.  Yes, I knew from that moment this movie was in trouble.    Actually calling this a movie is giving it too much credit, this doesn't feel like a movie at all but a Universal Studios staged show.  Yes, this feels like one of those stunt shows with the bad acting, bad dialogue, and phony looking special effects and fist fights.  The only difference here is instead of having a Harrison Ford look alike playing Indiana Jones we actually have the really thing.  It would be like Kevin Costner really starring in that Water World show the park used to have.    The plot of this movie is of little consequences.  It involves evil Russians, a crystal skull which looks like something that can be purchased at an adult book store, and some aliens.  All of this is an excuse to have another Indiana Jones movie.  And of course you may know that Karen Allen from the first movie is back but it's a thankless role and about equivalent to having Chewbacca back in \\"Star Wars: Episode III\\".      So how bad is this movie?  (Spoilers)  Let's just say there is a scene in which Indiana Jones survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator and at one point of the movie Shia Lebeouf ends up swinging in trees like Tarzan to catch up with high speed vehicles.  By the way, Shia Lebeouf it doesn't take a lot of brains to figure out Lebeouf's characters true relationship to Jones.    So why two stars?  Well, the blu ray does look fantastic so I wouldn't call this a total waste.  Some of the special effects are convincing and there is a nice motorcycle chase scene in the first half of the movie which isn't all bad.  But apart from this \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a bust.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is without any doubt one of the best stories I have ever come across.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game.  The entire cast is outstanding.  There is a LOT of very profane language.  That I did not like at all.  It is a reality of prison life though, unfortunately.  Buy this movie as you will NOT be disappointed I can assure you of that.  Good watching!

0380730405|4.0|Do not be discouraged by the seemingly slow pace of this book; real life is often uneventful for a while. I did not particularly enjoy the first two chapters of Rebecca and almost made the mistake of not reading the rest so please don't put it down!  However, I probably didn't care for it at first because I was expecting a much different writing style than Daphne Du Maurier actually writes in. I will provide a suggestion: start the book by wanting to meeting the characters and absorbing the setting.  (Also, expect some people to drop in and out like in real life, as all people don't have to be important or necessary to the plot to be included.)  This is such a great mystery.  The only thing I didn't like about this was the beginning which I feel should have been placed at the end instead.

B001AQO41E|5.0|Here we have one of the scariest films of the 80's - a classic.  Who can forget \\"Carrie Anne, Don't go into the light!!\\"  Films of this age are hit and miss with blu ray transfers.  Sometimes the quality is subpar and sometimes the film is so dated however good the transfer it lacks any true oomph.  Luckily neither of these two things happen here.<br /><br />The blu ray transfer shines.  Colors are crisp and there is no grain visible from age.  One might think that the type of visual effects used this long ago might not transfer well but they certainly do.  They pop.  Added to this brilliant picture is audio that keeps the tension mounting and will have you jumping at every scare.  Dialogue is strong and audio effects utilize all speakers to their max.<br /><br />It is great to see that such a classic film has not aged and is just as effective today.  This blu ray disc also comes in a special hardcover case that has a great booklet about the film.  For those who remember the film definitely purchase it on blu ray in its new glory.  Those who have never seen it will get a definite treat.
B000002UAO|5.0|Fantastic older Beatles album. A must-buy for any collector of the greatest rock and roll band EVER!
B001QWEE4E|5.0|Some of the reviews here are so sad.  We live in such a troubled time where the most important thing should be for all people to be accepted totally - whatever their sex, race, age, color or sexual identity.  The hate reviews here really do trouble me for the hate really isn't for the people they are attacking but comes from within the people themselves.  The only people capable of such hate are those who have it within themselves and must look at themselves first.<br /><br />That aside, let me review the brilliant masterpiece that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  The film is beautiful in every way.  Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.  This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.  Some have called it the gay GONE WITH THE WIND.  The most important thing here is that none of the characters are stereotypes.  Yes, the relationship is between two men but that is not the purpose of the film.  It is not a gay message film.  It is a love message film.  When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.<br /><br />Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.<br /><br />The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.<br /><br />This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.  Highly recommend this amazing film.nhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.

The  characters are 6 idiots: obnoxious, disgusting, stupid, ignorant, ridiculous, pathetic, pitiful, and what have you. And kudos for the producers because they selected actors/actresses that didn't have to change very much to go into character(Matthew Perry takes the first prize here).

I realize that these may seem like extreme statements, particularly the second one. But I mean them both quite soberly. In my personal life, it helped me to heal old ruptures such as one between my mother and myself that enabled the two of us to have a deep close connection when her life ended. Other very difficult relationships have become joyful and more harmonious. It helped me develop an empathic connection with myself and other people. On one level, shifting from judgments of ourselves and others to consciousness of what we are feeling and needing and requesting to make life more wonderful might seem simplistic, but it promotes a process within oneself and others (and I have witnessed the transformative power of this process in others as well as myself) that has remarkable depth. If you want to enrich your experience of life, and improve the quality of your connection with others, and promote peace by living it, I cannot recommend this book too highly!
0765348276|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for awhile.  It came highly recommended, and so went into my to-read queue.  I've been reading Scalzi's blog for ages (and, since Amazon gets cranky about URLs in reviews, I'll leave it as a very easy exercise for the reader to find it) because this book came so highly recommended, and have generally enjoyed it.  But the real reason that I ended up reading it was because I had an unexpected trip and needed a paperback.  It wasn't a good reason, but I'm okay with that.    In the future, after additional wars on our planet, humanity has finally started to colonise space.  And we're not alone out there in the stars: many other civilisations are out there, too.  But planets fit for survival, human  or otherwise, are scarce, and so humanity must compete with the others for the planets that can be colonised.  And so, the Colonial Defence Force is formed to protect the existing colonies, and fight to secure additional colonies.      The CDF is known on Earth, but their technologies are unknown.  Those young enough can volunteer to settle the colonies.  At age 65, you can volunteer for the army, and actually enter it at age 75.  Everyone assumes that the CDF can somehow make you younger, but no-one from the colonies ever returns to Earth, and technology doesn't allow for communication between the colonies and Earth, so no-one really knows what the CDF does or what's happening out in space.    John and his wife had signed up, but his wife passed away before she turned 75.  John follows through anyway, deciding that he has little left on Earth to live for.  So John does become younger, trains for the army, and fights the aliens.  Along the way, he learns how low the chances of survival are for him and his fellow soldiers, as well as learning some of the secrets of the CDF -- including the rumoured Ghost Brigades.    I'm glad I listened to that recommendation, and I'm sorry I let such a great book wait in my to-read queue for so long.  The book is excellent, and reminds me of Heinlein in his prime.  Scalzi acknowledges his debt to Heinlein in the afterword; it most reminds me of \\"[[ASIN:B000O5KG8C Glory Road]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0441014100 Starship Troopers]]\\".
B00125WAWS|3.0|'The Great Debaters is inspired by the true-life exploits of the all-black Wiley College debating team in Marshall, Texas in the 1930s. The script follows only the bare outline of the events that actually occurred. The debates themselves and the ideas behind them are a very small part of the picture. Instead we're treated to a series of snippets (or sound bites) with the Wiley team always taking the morally superior position and of course winning. At no time are they asked to show their real skills as debaters and take a position which they ethically and morally oppose. While the true Wiley College debaters of history were certainly admirable for what they achieved, there was no need to put them all on a pedestal by having them best the Harvard Debate team in the film's climax. In reality, Wiley beat USC; by depicting them as beating Harvard, the implication is that somehow they were superstars for beating the best (and hey maybe they were just excellent students who don't need to be mythologized).<br /><br />The main character, Melvin B. Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) is based on the real Wiley College professor who also was a union organizer. In a scene that felt like it was more likely to take place in the 1960s than the 1930s, Tolson heads a secret meeting of black sharecroppers as well as whites intent on organizing against racist farmers. The meeting is broken up by a group of angry whites and Tolson escapes with his life (along with James Farmer Jr., the 14 year old member of his debating team, later to become a famous civil rights leader). The probability of this scene actually having happened in 1930s Texas is low especially the idea that there were progressive whites who would even consider attending a meeting together with poor black sharecroppers. Later, Tolson is arrested for organizing the union meeting. In reality,wouldn't he have been taken away in the middle of the night and dumped in a shallow grave? Or perhaps lynched? Here, the black community wields a lot more power than it actually had in those days, when a group led by James Farmer Sr., the dignified Wiley professor played by Forrest Whittaker, convinces the town's sheriff to release Tolson on bond. We never really find out the outcome of Tolson's arrest (which presumably is a fictional scene) but according to the end credits, he went on to live a distinguished life as an academic and poet.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is taken up with a subplot concerning the romance between the team's only female member, Samantha Booke and the bad-boy character, Henry Lowe (who incurs Samantha's wrath by getting drunk and hanging out with another woman after witnessing a lynching). The aforementioned 14 year old has a crush on Samantha and must overcome his feelings of jealousy before he can best Harvard in the final showdown.<br /><br />The film is not without its powerful moments. The most memorable is when James Farmer Sr. accidentally kills a boar while driving in his car with his family. He's forced to pay compensation to two racist whites by handing over his paycheck and is further humiliated when one of the racists drops the check and makes Farmer bend over and pick it up (it's scenes like this that are far more effective than the typical mob scenes of racist whites on the loose since they show the day-to-day humiliations which blacks had to endure across the country on a daily basis). There is also an actual lynching scene which Tolson and his debaters stumble upon while driving on a darkened road.<br /><br />Despite this, The Great Debaters is a well-intentioned but formulaic project. Yes, it always feels good to be on the winning side but when drama becomes manipulative, art is subsumed by propaganda.ds a lot more power than it actually had in those days, when a group led by James Farmer Sr., the dignified Wiley professor played by Forrest Whittaker, convinces the town's sheriff to release Tolson on bond.

006054094X|2.0|There are quite a number of conclusory leaps of faith in the book.  While it makes for some interesting stories and presents another point of view on history, I would take it all as entertainment and not as a new text book.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Slumdog Millionaire chronicles the odyssey of Jamal Malik from the slums of Bombay to now modern Mumbai. The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of \\"Who wants to be a Millionaire\\". He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.<br /><br />The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.<br /><br />At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards).<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.<br /><br />Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.<br /><br />Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character--she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture. For all its shotcomings, it's still a solid piece of entertainment and will keep you riveted in your seat.g a Bollywood production in the second half.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|After being extremely disappointed with 'Casino Royale' (with an ordinary poker game as its primary action sequence), I was happy to see that the producers of Quantum of Solace decided to bring back 'Bond' to its action-packed roots. I am still trying to get used to Daniel Craig as Bond however. He's about the opposite of the urbane, sophisticated and witty character initially developed by the greatest Bond of them all, Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is closer to a Steve McQueen type but unable to capture McQueen's true 'bad boy' persona. Craig's interest in women is minimal (he spends a very short time in bed in Quantum of Solace). In this new version of Bond, he's a trained killer who rarely shows emotion (there is a brief scene where he cradles the head of an associate who's been shot) but for the most part, Craig's Bond is as cold and ruthless as the villains he's trying to hunt down. While not very handsome, Craig is in extremely good shape and handles all the action sequences with gusto.<br /><br />There are plenty of excellent action sequences in Quantum of Solace which will keep you entertained. These sequences run the gamut from car, boat and plane chases to a dazzlingly choreographed face off between Bond and the primary villain's henchmen at an opera house.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko as Camille is a more proactive 'Bond girl' than usual. She seeks to take revenge on General Medrano (Quantum's #2 villain) who killed her family members when she was a child. Bond 'rescues' her when she finds herself alone on boat with the General and his goons. Later she's angry with Bond for 'rescuing' her, upsetting her plans to kill Medrano on the boat (it's never made clear how Camille could kill Medrano without getting killed herself--and also how would she have been able to kill him as it did not appear she was carrying a weapon).<br /><br />Dominic Greene is the primary villain played by Mathieu Amalric. He's a sleazy businessman masquerading as an environmental crusader. Bond discovers that instead of trying to aid the local populace, he's dammed off all their water causing a drought. At the end of the film, Bond captures Greene and leaves him in the desert with a can of (what looks like) draino (presumably which he can use to commit suicide). I was expecting something more dramatic such as Bond destroying the dam and having the water cascade into the drought stricken area, replenishing the water supply and killing Greene in the process.<br /><br />Judi Dench is excellent as usual as \\"M\\" but I still miss the wonderful gadgets Bond uses to defeat his opponents. The signature 007 music comes on at the end but why not use it at the beginning too? In a nod to be relevant to today, the opening theme song unfortunately is greatly influenced by rap music. It's basically a tuneless song and detracts from the film's opening.<br /><br />For now, the James Bond franchise appears to be successfully emulating the non-stop action stunts of the Jason Bourne series. But the producers should be forewarned: start giving Bond more of a personality or the Bond fan base will start clamoring for Daniel Craig's replacement.ead of trying to aid the local populace, he's dammed off all their water causing a drought.

B000JQUMPI|5.0|I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose. (as funny as that sounds) You'll fall in love with Jo's oddities just as much as with Beth's gentil manners. It is a great book that everyone should read!
B00005JPUN|3.0|The Invasion did not get a very good critical reception and I wonder why that's so. After all, this is a sci-fi movie about bodies being snatched by aliens. If you count up all the positive things in 'The Invasion', that will balance out the bad. Therefore, this film ranks a passable \\"5\\".<br /><br />Let's look at the good things first. 'The Invasion' starts off simply and effectively. A shuttle craft plummets to earth after some kind of malfunction. Pieces of the craft contain alien spores which can infect and ultimately take over peoples' DNA after they fall asleep. The spores start spreading after souvenir hunters start picking up pieces of the doomed craft (there's a great line about someone selling a piece of the wreckage on eBay).<br /><br />Tension builds as we see how the transformation of ordinary people into zombies affects the protagonist, Carol Bennell (a psychiatrist played by Nicole Kidman). We see these transformations beginning with one of Carol's patients who claims she no longer recognizes her abusive husband as someone she really knows (instead of abusing her, he kills the family dog without emotion!). Then when Carol leaves the office, the camera pans out to reveal what has happened to the wider society--now the 'pod people' walk around with blank stares on their faces while the enforcers amongst their group grab 'normal' people and infect them against their will. In a sense, the pod people (or better yet, the spore people) are a metaphor for cult-like societies (such as North Korea) who brainwash their followers into slave-like submission.<br /><br />Carol's ex-husband, Tucker, works for the Center for Disease Control and he's infected early by the alien invaders. He returns from Atlanta (where he's had no contact with his son for two years) and suddenly wants visitation rights from Carol who has no choice to now let her ex see her son. Tucker obviously wants to infect the son, Oliver, (winningly played by an extremely talented child actor, Jackson Bond) but it turns out he's immune due to having contracted chicken pox as a very young child (don't ask me to explain the science behind why he develops an immunity). The rest of the movie is taken up with Carol trying to save her son from Tucker's clutches and also trying to avoid falling asleep after Tucker infects her.<br /><br />I think that Nicole Kidman signed on to make this movie precisely because one of the themes is that the maternal bond is elemental. Carol bonds with Oliver and the two actors have great chemistry together (despite this being a horror movie, many women will be drawn to it due to the mother/son chemistry). Daniel Craig (looking much better than how he appears in the James Bond movies) is effective as Ben Driscoll as a low-key scientist who's trying to help Carol escape the clutches of the aliens.<br /><br />A group of supporting actors in a scene taking place at the Russian Embassy also gives 'The Invasion' a brief window of respectability. Driscoll's friends are a Czech couple who are friends with the Russian Ambassador, Yorish. He ironically argues with Carol that the Social Dawinism of his hot-headed Russian culture is far superior to the wishy-washy liberalism of the West (pointing out that she seeks to take the fire out of her patients by dulling them with psychotropic medication).<br /><br />'The Invasion' falters in the first half due to the screenwriter's insistence on depicting Carol as being completely myopic. Despite the fact that she is a psychiatrist and would naturally be skeptical of some of her patients' claims, there are too many clues that would cause her to become aware of the alien invasion much sooner than how it occurs in the storyline. The writers could have solved this lack of plausibility by perhaps establishing early on that Carol is one of those professional people who is so completely devoted to science and so contemptuous of anything that might smack of the supernatural that it would blind her to what was actually going on around her.<br /><br />The second half of 'The Invasion' becomes repetitious with too many chase scenes and the clich&eacute; of Driscoll, Carol's best friend, suddenly being taken over by the aliens at the film's climax. Jeffrey Wright is completely forgettable as Dr. Galeano, Driscoll's buddy who develops the vaccine that saves humanity. Finally, I didn't buy at all the news media's failure to uncover the alien invasion. Despite the horrific changes in the vast majority of the population, early on there had to be some uninfected people in the media who would have broadcast what was going on, not only on television but on the internet as well. Instead, the obvious changes are labeled as \\"flu-like symptoms\\".<br /><br />I found 'The Invasion' to be mildly entertaining. Plotwise, it sort of ran out of ideas in the second half but technically the film was well-served by excellent editing and a moody and introspective soundtrack.of 'The Invasion' becomes repetitious with too many chase scenes and the cliché of Driscoll, Carol's best friend, suddenly being taken over by the aliens at the film's climax.

The three \\"bums\\" are characters that all of us can relate to, even if their are a bit extreme.  This movie has adventure, comedy and a hint of romance.  There is enough to keep your attention.

B001NFNFNU|3.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />In the old days, Clint Eastwood was Dirty Harry, the vigilante maverick pitted against a world of bleeding heart liberals. Now times have changed and he's drifted more toward the left. In Million Dollar Baby, spokespersons for the Roman Catholic Church are the bad guys because they're against assisted suicide. In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood attempts to soft pedal Japanese fanaticism by offering up the quid pro quo of a 'good' Japanese soldier to balance out a 'bad' one. And here in 'Changeling', it's the corrupt LAPD from the late 1920s which is the subject of another one of Eastwood's morality plays.<br /><br />In Eastwood's world view, it's simply a question of good vs. evil. That's why he's always drawn to melodrama which is the perfect type of drama for reminding us that he's always on the 'right' (and winning) side! Changeling's screenwriter, Michael Straczynski, researched this true crime story for a year and then changed the facts not only to improve the narrative but to also manipulate our emotions. Part of his quandary was that he needed to integrate two tangentially related aspects of the story, the kidnapping of the 10 year old boy, Walter Collins, and the mass murders of children on the Northcott Farm (Straczynski decided not to put the killer's mother into the script even though she actually confessed to the murder of the Collins boy and was sentenced to prison).<br /><br />Stracyznski is much more successful simply relating the details of the investigation into the child killings. Tension builds as one of the detectives uncovers the horror quite by chance after having to track down a juvenile runaway who needs to be deported to his native Canada. Before he's shipped back home, the juvenile reveals the sickening details of what happened and this in turn leads to a series of grim scenes including the digging up of evidence, the flight and apprehension of the accused in Vancouver, flashbacks of the actual crimes and the eventual trial and execution of the murderer.<br /><br />James Harner as Gordon Northcott, looks a lot like the actual killer (check the old photos!) and ably conveys his creepy manic and manipulative demeanor. When dealing with the historical facts of the crime itself, Eastwood is on solid ground. He falters however when he dwells too long on the sickening circumstances of the killer's execution. What exactly is the point in drawing out this scene? Again it's part and parcel of Eastwood's strategy to champion himself as the guardian of morality. The bad guys always must get their comeuppance whether it's pointing a gun at a miscreant and blurting out &#34;make my day&#34; or having a serial killer twist at the end of the hangman's rope a little longer than the viewer needs to see.<br /><br />Unfortunately Stracyznski appears to be at a complete loss as to what to do with the film's protagonist, Christine Collins. In real life, Collin's husband was locked up in San Quentin. Could it be that Collins wasn't the saint that Stracyznski makes her out to be? It certainly would have been more interesting to have Collins depicted as a complicated human being than the melodramatic victim depicted here. Collin's victimhood reaches its apotheosis when the police lock her up without a warrant at the Psychopathic Hospital. In a derivative scene right out of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Collins is subjected to various degradations including a strip search, imprisonment on the mental ward, a coercive interview by the institution's vile psychiatrist and shock treatment given to a prostitute who comes to her aid (Stracyznski fails to do his research since shock treatment wasn't used in mental institutions until 1937!).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is not an actor of great range to begin with but here she's saddled with a script that tells us virtually nothing about its main character. Jolie is good at histrionic expression but after awhile there are a few too many scenes where she pleads, &#34;I want my child back&#34;. The film's ending loses dramatic tension since the protagonist becomes a passive participant. Collins not only sits through Northcottt's trial but she also is a spectator at the City inquiry into police misconduct in her case. In addition to Christine, the good Reverand Briegleb, played by John Malkovich, is another overly self-righteous character who remains underdeveloped (I also wondered if the police were so corrupt, why didn't they at least harass the Reverand at any point?) James Donovan's J.J. Jones was much more on the mark as Christine's tormentor (although the Irish accent probably would have been more applicable to New York than Los Angeles).<br /><br />Despite his liberal leanings these days, Clint Eastwood will never give up his original moniker as 'Dirty Harry'. He'll always be the man to protect us from the criminal element whether they be ordinary street thugs, corrupt police and government officials, serial killers or (as in his new film, Gran Torino) Asian street gangs! As long as Eastwood continues to see himself as an arbiter of morality, we will continue to endure more melodramatic tales of stereotyped self-righteous victims triumphing over cold-hearted villains.he film's ending loses dramatic tension since the protagonist becomes a passive participant.

B001M4YZ90|3.0|After getting sick after attending too many touchy-feely Kaballah sessions (force-fed to him by his now ex-wife, Madonna), Guy Ritchie has returned to his roots with another look at the London Underworld in 'Rocknrolla.' I have not seen his two earlier efforts, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' but having read some of the reviews of this film, I'm told that Rocknrolla is very similar to those prior efforts.<br /><br />Rocknrolla is not at all like 'The Sopranos' since none of the characters are at all sympathetic. In the Sopranos, the characters are charming but are always in denial about their lack of morality. There is always the strong presence of law enforcement which forces the Sopranos' characters to always look over their shoulders. In Rocknrolla there is no such counterweight. When we do see the police in Rocknrolla we see them only briefly and they're the equivalent of Keystone Cops.<br /><br />Rocknrolla depicts a contained universe of low-life criminals who take turns at double-crossing one another. Ritchie is not looking to sketch multi-dimensional character portraits as we see in The Sopranos, but rather focus on certain farcical 'types'. Some of the farce is extremely broad--for example two Russian hired assassins who dress up in sado-masochistic outfits and play sado-masochistic games with their tied-up victim but choose not to finish him off right away. The joke is in the way they get sidetracked (that psychopathic killers might also be effeminate) but it's not funny. Similarly, the film's protagonist \\"One-Two\\" (played by Gerard Butler) is upset with 'Handsome Bob', a member of his gang, when he reveals that he's gay. But instead of beating him up, he calms down, becomes wholly sympathetic and then offers to have sex with him (to show that he is an 'understanding' fellow). In another context (such as Robert DeNiro showing his 'sensitive side' as a mobster spilling his guts out to his shrink in 'Analyze This') the reversal of a 'sensitive' mobster happens to work. But here, the reversal has no panache.<br /><br />Rocknrolla is very difficult to follow due to the East End accents and an extremely convoluted plot. Tom Wilkinson as Lenny Cole, the real estate crime boss, is probably the most believable of all the criminals depicted in this film (the only scene focusing on Lenny I really had trouble with is when the Russian boss has his henchman cripple Lenny on the golf course; how could Lenny have been lured into a situation where he had no protection?).<br /><br />Of what I could understand of the plot, One-two (leader of a gang) borrows money from Lenny to buy some property but is unable to pay him back. Meanwhile, the Russian crime boss agrees to pay Lenny 7 million Euros to bribe public officials so that he can build a new sports stadium in London. As collateral, the Russian gives Lenny an expensive painting which is very dear to him which Lenny will hold until the deal is complete (it's hard to understand why the Russian would want to part with the painting as it has so much sentimental value to him). The Russian's accountant (Stella, played by a sexy Thandie Newton) hires One-Two and his gang who steals her boss's 7 million which he is going to pay to Lenny. One-Two then uses some of that money to satisfy his debt to Lenny. Finally, Lenny's rock-star stepson (who reportedly is missing and presumed a suicide) steals the painting and Lenny sends his right-hand man, Archie along with One-Two to find the painting and get it back to him before the Russian blows his stack.<br /><br />While most of the characters are neither sympathetic, funny or that involving, what I do like about the film is that Ritchie keeps things moving at a frenetic pace with excellent acting, editing and cinematography. By the time the movie is over, you'll be ready to watch it again to figure out exactly what happened. Despite the flawed script, Rocknrolla still has enough interesting things in it to keep your interest. Rocknrolla can best be termed a 'black comedy'. Its main weakness is that it's not all that funny; its strength lies in its light-hearted atmosphere--it doesn't take itself that seriously, despite the deep level of violence that permeates the film.comedy'.

B001N3OCV6|5.0|Don't read other people's BS reviews. They are only rating this soundtrack by what it's missing, not reviewing the excellent songs in this movie.    The music fits perfectly with what the movie portrayed. The music really takes you back to another time as does the movie. This soundtrack is worth every penny!!
B00064WSNM|5.0|\\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\", \\"Starless and Bible Black\\", and \\"Red\\" are all equally superb. I've been a fan from the first album through the current lineup , it's hard to have favorites.... BUT.... these three albums are (for me) just the best of the lot. For those unfamiliar with this era of Crimson, all of these works have pretty much the same lineup (core of Wetton, Fripp, and Bruford).<br /><br />There is a very good reason that this era of Crimson has been given so much live documentation (legal and bootleg): there is a spine chilling dynamism that never lets up.  Progressive rock would never see these heights again.
006135323X|5.0|Better researched than Gladwell's Blink, filled with surprises the way Hartfod's The Undercover Economist couldn't be, thoroughly down-to-earth (and less cyber-esoterical) than Weinberger's Everything Is Miscellaneous and more easily applicable in a way that even Gilbert's amazing Stumbling On Happiness can't match, Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational refreshingly raises the bar on pop-(social)-science writing.    Ariely surprises us even as he exposes the myriad of strange/wonderful programming which impacts our decisions. Whilst some of these were 'common sense' (e.g. feeling more attached to that which we owned as compared to that which we didn't possess), Ariely's numerous experiments drive home the realisation deeper than previously perceived.    Here's a quick part-summary of what the book reveals about us:    1. We are more likely to cheat when dealing with non-monetary items (e.g. we would almost unhesitatingly smooch a $2 pen from office, but when it comes to stealing $1 from the petty cash it's often a no-no)    2. We tend to enjoy our food if we can order 'in private' i.e. by, say, ticking on a menu-form which is eventually passed to the waiter, as oppposed to 'declaring' out loud what we'd like    3. We are predisposed to selecting an option with an obviously poorer close parallel i.e. if given Luxury Watch A which costs $50, Normal Watch B at $10 and Marginally Above-Average Watch C at $48, on average we'd go for Watch A. Why? Because in comparison with Watch C it's a better choice.    4. We determine what prices are acceptable based on initial purchases. Jack's cost of Chinese food for $20 and Jill's (for the same dishes) at $40 will decide their future valuations of said cuisine i.e. we 'anchor' ourselves to our initial price-experiences of goods, and these anchors can be completely arbitrary.    5. We are inexplicably attracted to \\"FREE!\\", often making purchases we wouldn't have on this basis. Somehow $0 creates purchase-waves where even $0.20 (a 'virtually free' price) fail.    6. We're obsessed with options and keeping them open, at the price of losing much needed focus and attention.    7. We 'believe in' goods that are priced higher, even when the substance of these goods do not differ much from lower-priced items (e.g. aspirin, bottled water, professionals, etc.).    8. We're suckers for presentation and form, and would generally feel a moderately prepared roast beef served on attractive china tasted better than excellently cooked beef on a plastic plate. Hence, our easy succumbing to branding which creates expectations which improves perception about the products we're getting.    9. When horny or angry, our propensity to do things we'd normally deny ever being capable of doing rises by a significant factor. In a word, we have a Mr. Hyde lying semi-dormant inside us.    The next step is to apply these to our work, our communities and our families. This is the exciting part as I feel there's so much that behavioural economics can contribute (another sign that this is great book, when the reader is inspired towards further exploration).    What I also like about the book is how Ariely reflects a deep passion towards the betterment of our society, e.g. when he proposed to banks to have a credit card which would stop a spender from charging above a predetermined limit.    Part self-help, part life-commentary, part research-report, all social-innovation cum revelations(!), Dan Ariely's first book is one of those I'd tip for the \\"if you're only going to read one book this year\\" awards. Then again, I'd recommend you buy it - you're more likely to believe you've had a good read thus.
B0000CNY27|3.0|John Carpenter's camp fest Escape from New York is a pleasure - as one can see from amazon viewer reviews - to the fans of B-movies and sci-fi. It is incredibly dated, a feast of contineous over acting and its script jampacked with logical issues (cassette tapes in 1997? Water, electricity, heat, food? Did the UN relocate? What's harder: finding a person in this wild concrete jungle or an x-ray machine outside of New York to neutralize the capsules?).   Most of us can also ignore the fact that none of the exteriors have actually been shot in New York. But the film's problems add more to its charm than they hurt. The soundtrack, the director's usual minimalistic syntheshizer compositions, is fantastic.      Carpenter has managed to produce pictures that withhold the test of time quite well as we have seen with his worldwide smash hit Halloween and The Thing, which didn't do well at all upon its release to the silver screen but has gained cult status and critic's appreciation in later years. However Escape from New York remains a great flic to pop into your DVD player, fire up your microwave for some popcorn and enjoy hoaky dialogues that will stick with you for a while.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|Warning: Spoilers for both Seasons Two and Three!<br /><br />Season Two of LOST was a very strong follow-up to one of the most impressive new shows in several years. It has also proven to be one of the most interesting television series on multiple grounds. For instance, it has taken the serial format to perhaps its logical extreme. If at one end of the narrative spectrum you have LAW AND ORDER, a show that each week features a completely self-contained episode that leaves no plot or dramatic conflict unresolved (a format I will confess to utterly detesting), at the other you have LOST, a series that will only complete its story when it comes to an end. Comparing these shows to literature, LAW AND ORDER could be compared to a large collection of short stories. A show like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which more or less told a single major story each season, could be compared to a sequence of novels. LOST, on the other hand, could be compared to a massive epic novel like WAR AND PEACE or LES MISERABLES. Is LOST a great show? Given this narrative structure, we honestly don't know yet. It is the only show that I know that can only be properly judged when it comes to an end. We can say this: this has a chance to be one of the truly great shows in television history. What we can say so far is that Seasons One and Two have been wonderful components of what we can only hope will be a great story.<br /><br />If we thought we knew what LOST was about in Season One, Season Two proved us wrong. We knew that there were people that Rousseau referred to as \\"the Others\\" and we knew there was a hatch, but little did we realize that the island was perhaps (I say \\"perhaps\\" because we still aren't really sure) the setting for an elaborate set of social experiments, complete with covert observers. We also learned that the island was in fact home to multiple hatches, each with a distinct function. We further learned that the original group of survivors was not the only one from Flight 815 to survive the crash; we are introduced to a group of people commonly known as the Tailenders. As the season progressed, the number of new twists and revelations continued to mount. My only complaint with this has been that given the extremely large (and continually growing) cast we sometimes lose contact with the various individuals. Give a choice between a plot-driven and character-driven series, I'll always opt for the latter. Indeed, the stated intention for LOST was for it to be a character-driven series, but I'm not sure they have always maintained the proper balance. Mainly this is simply the result of the gigantic cast.<br /><br />There were many new characters in Season Two, as well as a host of guest appearances in the various flashback scenes. (On a purely personal level, I was especially delighted by the brief appearance of Wayne Pygram in the Rose and Barnard flashback episode. Pygram played one of the truly great villains in TV history as Scorpius in FARSCAPE. The delight in LOST was that he spoke in his normal accent and with minimal make up, while as Scorpius he appeared in heavy make up and spoke in a highly cultivated accent.) We had six major new characters introduced. First we met inside the hatch Henry Ian Cusick's character Desmond, who promptly disappears until the end of the season. Although the season ends with Desmond apparently dying, the fact that Cusick has been announced as a full time cast member sort of takes the suspense out of whether he survived or not. Interestingly, Desmond's last name is Hume, joining Locke and Rousseau as characters sharing last names with major 18th century philosophers. We then met four major new characters among the Tailenders, Michelle Rodriguez's Ana-Lucia, Cynthia Watros's Libby, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Mr. Eko, and Sam Anderson's Barnard, the oft-mentioned husband of Rose. Fans of ANGEL were delighted to discover that Barnard was played by the same actor who so memorably portrayed Holland Manners, theelegant but thoroughly evil head of Wolfram and Hart. Last but certainly not least, we met one of the Others, Henry Gale, portrayed magnificently by Michael Emerson (who has been announced as a fulltime cast member for Season Three). All of these characters brought a great deal to the show, though considerable controversy arose when Rodriguez and Watros were both arrested for drunk driving. This was especially troubling in Rodriguez's case because of prior drunk driving convictions and possible violation of probation. There is a widespread belief that both their characters' deaths later in the season were connected with the arrests. The fact that both characters seemed to leave the show prematurely certainly bolsters that belief.<br /><br />The producers have already informed us that while Season Two was about the Hatch, Season Two will be about the Others. Hopefully it will also deal with two major events from the season finale. Throughout Season Two Locke and others had diligently been resetting the timer inside the bunker, but in the finale they let it go all the way down. Show runner and co-creator Damon Lindelhof has already acknowledged that this was an incredibly important event, the ramifications to be dealt with in Season Three. He has confessed that on a scale of importance from 1 to 10, allowing the numbers to go all the way down was a 10. But perhaps even more interesting, the event triggered by the numbers going down resulted in a detectable event elsewhere in the world. The very last scene of Season Two was of two men surrounded by scientific instruments detecting the event on the island, showing for the first time that there really is still an outside world. Furthermore, one of the men then made a phone call to the woman we learned in a flashback was the extremely wealthy woman with whom Desmond was in love. In other words, she is searching for Desmond. So in a new twist Desmond could prove to be the most important character on the show.<br /><br />I have to confess that Season Two did for the first time create some uneasiness for me about the show. First and foremost, I have been troubled by the deaths on the show. We all remember a time when characters were simply not killed on shows. THE X-FILES was the first show I know that killed off recurring characters, first Deepthroat, then later X, Krycek, the Elegant Man, and other supporting characters (just how many times did the CSM die?). But none of these characters were people we had come to care for deeply. Then BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (along with its spin off ANGEL) raised the stakes by killing off characters we cared about (I still remember the shock I felt when Jenny Calendar died). Now on most really good serial format shows major characters die. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA currently does this better than any other show on TV. LOST, on the other hand, has some of the worst deaths of major characters that I have ever seen. Boone's death was the only one that seems justifiable on narrative grounds. Sharon died with much of her story left untold or unresolved. But the real crime was with the death of Ana-Lucia and Libby. Granted many fans did not like Michelle Rodriguez's character and there was a very real chance that she was going to be jailed because of violation of her probation, thus imperiling her involvement in Season Three. But Ana-Lucia was introduced as if she were going to be a major character, some storylines were laid out that by all rights should have taken some time to spin out, and she was introduced in the show's structure as if she were going to be integral. Then she was just killed off. It just didn't feel right at all. Libby's death was nearly as bad. We were given some tantalizing hints about who she was and her background, but then was killed off even before we had a flashback episode for her. On top of all this, J. J. Abrams, who was not involved in Season Two due to his work on MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 (his involvement in Season Three will be minimal due to his upcoming STAR TREK film, which tragically might also take the real creative genius behind the show, Damon Lindelhof away from LOST), stated a few days before Ana-Lucia died that Michelle Rodriguez's place on the show was not endangered by her arrest. All in all, the entire Rodriguez-Watros affair just smelled and I'll confess that I believe the two were punished for their perceived sins. I'm just a big nervous now given Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's recent DUI arrest. His character is probably too established for them to cavalierly kill him off, but added to rumors that Maggie Grace's character was killed off for some prima donna behavior on the set, one wonders if this is an unusually intolerant production. Rumors are frequently wrong, but what is incontestable is that people usually die on this show in ways that don't especially advance the plot.<br /><br />There is one cause for hope in Season Three. The end of ALIAS has freed up some of that show's production talent to come over to LOST. Drew Goddard, one of the most spectacularly gifted writers on television (he first came to public notice in Season Seven of BUFFY, where as a new writer he wrote most of the best episodes, including the memorable \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" and the great Spike episode \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\" while on ALIAS was tabbed to write the series finale). Goddard will almost certainly gain a reputation as LOST's best writer. He did contribute one episode for Season One, the superb script for \\"Outlaws.\\" With the danger of much of the creative team of LOST leaving for the STAR TREK movie, the addition of someone with Goddard's abilities is comforting.d for the first time create some uneasiness for me about the show.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|3.5 Stars - Clint Eastwood directs Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich in what I consider to be a mediocre film. Given the cast and the director,  I really expected much more. While the movie's plot sounds intriguing, and this true life story is riveting, I felt the production wanting. There is enough real material in this historical tale , (it is so shocking and dramatic in itself), that the addional drama, superfluous details, and some of the overly emotional scenes, one right after another, make for too much \\"sturm und drang.\\" Angelina Jolie gives a fine performance. However, even though her character is living through a total nightmare, her repetitious crying in almost every scene, through runny eyes, black with mascara, becomes a bit much. Meanwhile, not enough focus is placed on the corrupt LAPD, and  their role in the tragedy. They're the real villains here. In their efforts to close the case, they are ruthless in their attempts to avoid bad press.<br /><br />Christine Collins, (Jolie), a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, works as a supervisor at a telephone company, roller skating up and down the switchboard line, trouble shooting with the operators when necessary. She is a good mother, working hard to support her son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), making sure he does his homework, playing at measuring his height against the wall, picking him up at school every day, and taking him on excursions when she is free. Christine is called to work, an extra shift, one Saturday. She returns home and finds Walter has gone missing. She scours the neighborhood, becoming more and more frantic as she realizes that her son has truly vanished. She calls the police, but is told by the man who answers, Detective Lester Ybarra, (Michael Kelly), that most missing children turn up by morning and she shouldn't worry. Ha!!! Ybarra does turn out to be the only good cop as he seriously works the case, trying to unravel the mystery of Walter's disappearance.  When the police finally arrive the next day, they take down all the vital information, including Walter's photograph, and tell the now hysterical mother that they will do their best.<br /><br />J.J. Jones, (Jeffrey Donovan), the head of the missing persons department, is condescending and arrogant, at best, while handling this tragedy. Meanwhile, Christine is conducting her own investigation, contacting the police in various cities to see if anyone has found a missing boy with her son's description. Radio preacher Rev. Gustav Briegleb, (John Malkovich), prays on the air for Christine and for the safe return of Walter. He and Christine have never met prior to this incident. The Rev. also lashes out at the LAPD for their corruption and laziness.<br /><br />Finally, Christine is informed that her son has been located. She rushes to meet the boy at the train, along with the police chief, but the boy turns out not to be her son. The reunion scene is documented by journalists and photographers, and the captain does not want to look incompetent nor does he want to embarrass the department. He persuades Christine to take the boy home for a night and promises she will realize that, after all the boy has been through, of course he has changed. However, a mother knows her child.<br /><br />Btw, a Changeling is a creature found in Western  European folklore. It is typically described as being the offspring of a fairy. troll or elf or other legendary creature that has been secretly left in the place of a human child. Thus the metaphor for the title.<br /><br />I don't want to add spoilers here, in case you decide to see the film.

1594201927|1.0|The Ascent of Money is a hastily written book, written to reach the market in time to capitalize on the unravelling financial crisis.  This haste is probably part of the reason for the book's many drawbacks and inaccuracies.  In general, the author does not say anything that would be insightful to anyone except the most ignorant man.  It makes me wonder what sort of person gives this book the accolades it does not deserve - probably the people who contributed to the crisis by their lack of prudence and sparse historical knowledge. Men looking for a level of depth beyond the 30 second sound-bite should read von Mises' Theory of Money and Credit or Friedman's Monetary History of the United States as starting points to understanding the ascent of money.

B000002KAT|5.0|There is true beauty in music.  On this album, it is found in van soulfulll yet almost wounded voice, and in the music that swirls behind the poetry of van's lyrics, the guitars and subtle strings that shimmer in the background.  this album tells the story of mans soul.  only the greatest albums in the world have the true power to pull that off, and this is one of them.   the album itself is composed of eight songs, slip in half.  the first half is titled \\"in the beggining\\".  this could be interpreted in many ways.  it could be begining of his life, or the life of mankind, or the begining of his inocence.  the second half is titled \\"afterwards\\".  it is essentially the emotionall fallout not only of the first half of the album, but of all the heartache that is felt in life.    This lyrics on this album are far surpass simply \\"songwriting\\".  there is pure poetry here.  the emotion is raw.  more real emotion here than i've ever heard on an album before.  not only is it reall, but it is in a large spectrum that rangers from the almost uphoric sence that we anticipate upon descovering ture happyness (this is what the song \\"sweet thing\\" echoes) all the way up to the despiration and heartache that expelled on tracks like Madame George and Cyprus avenue.  The Way Young Lovers Do is not only a passion song, but it is ABOUT passion.  there are a few critisms of this album.  one of which is that is not played perfectly.  i will argue that any time a music fan can listin to a record, and feel some sort of emtion surge through them,  if they can truely have their breath taken away, or their heart ripped out, or the soul soothed,  then THAT is what makes an album perfect.   all the shere emotion, all the absolutely wonderfull music, all the poetry, it all comes together to create one of the most aboundantly beautyfull albums ever recorded.
B00005JPY2|5.0|Set in a semi-fictional America - with all the familiar players - Zack Snyder's \\"Watchmen\\" is one of the most impressive movies I've seen so far this year. Snyder, cast and crew were dedicated to re-creating as truthfully as possible, the comic book elements fans of the series that its fans would demand. It paid off, but not without a few lulls. To his credit (and the horror of many) Snyder does not skimp one iota on the graphic violence, heightened sexuality and though deadly serious, liberally peppered with humor. The film opens with a brief scene of violence to set the time and planet jumping tale, followed by the most impressive opening credit sequence I've ever seen. In fact, the opening credits themselves - a recreation of many of the most iconic moments in 60's and 70's American history - are worth the ticket price. I found myself stirred emotionally, opening myself up for the insane, frightening world I was about to enter.    Most of the performance in Watchmen are adequate (Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre II) to top drawer (Billy Crudup's impressive Dr. Manhattan), with one particularly thrilling, pulse-pounding performance by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, arguably the heart and soul of the film. Haley's performance is so richly nuanced, starting at near fever pitch and growing in intensity from there. He is participant, narrator, catalyst for much of what happens through the film and clearly up to the challenge of a role that could easily have become . . . well, too cartoonish. He is, in a word: amazing.    Patrick Wilson is wonderful as the geekish, peaceable Dan/Night Owl, an endearing, soft-grained performance that tempers the often out-of-control violence in the world of Watchmen.    To Billy Crudup fell the unenviable task of making the elusive, cool-as-a-cucumber Dr. Manhattan a more likeable screen presence than he is required to be in the print-only version of the tale. He succeeds nicely, even stuck in the connundrum of wondering whether the humanrace is worth saving. It's a chilling proposition, particularly when we know/learn of Manhattan's previous human existence. The accident that created him is one of several moments in the film where Snyder expands the tension of the moment to let our emotions swell, this one (and the final scene) allowing for lump-in-the-throat heartbreak. Just as he is in the comics, Dr. Manhattan is naked through most of the film and eventually one gets used to the fact that almost every time we see him we're going to see his flacid blue penis. The CGI-transformed Crudup is brilliantly calm as he rationalizes his action (and non-action) to the point of frustration to all around him (especially Richard M. Nixon).    There will be plenty of naysayers, and fans who feel short-shrifted there favorite moments were not included, but such is the nature of filmmaking. Watchmen stayed with me through the night, and has, so far, dominated my thoughts today and I want to see it again soon. Even with its sometimes slowed down pacing, there is much to miss in this veritable \\"feast for the eyes\\" and I'd like to catch every frame as much as possible. I'd go just for Jackie Earle Haley's amazing tour-de-foce performance of Rorschach.
0312427999|5.0|Other reviews have stated the case quite eloquently regarding what a thoroughly researched and fascinating book this is, I merely wish to add that this book is essential reading for understanding the economic situation we find ourselves in and perhaps more importantly how it is being used to remake our world. Sadly but not unexpectedly Pres Obama is not providing the desperately needed shift in policies (as any cursory examination of his advisers and cabinet positions reveals). Certainly the author has strong opinions but her research and the citations offered to back up her arguments are fair and build a strong case. Read this book and ask questions.
B000006YXV|4.0|If you're an avid oldies collector, then you should skip over \\"The Very Best of Marvin Gaye\\".  After all, the Amazon page does list all 22 tracks on it, and 22 songs are not nearly enough to give one the breadth and scope of a talent like Marvin Gaye.  But the thing is: It is NOT a \\"greatest hits\\" set, it is a \\"very best of....\\", and those are always subject to the label owner's A/R department, and the marketing execs.  As this compilation shows, this label's people are obviously not music fans or even chartologists.  The songs on this compilation cannot be denied as being \\"among the best\\" of Marvin.  \\"The Very Best of\\"??  Purely subjective.  This disc would only be useful to plug holes in another single-disc compilation someone might have as their only Marvin Gaye album.  As anyone familiar with the ways of the greedy record companies will tell you, that is enough reason for a disc like this to even exist.  But if you already own one of the fine double disc comps, such as \\"Anthology\\", or the wonderful boxed set \\"The Master\\", there's no reason for you to even consider purchasing this.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I missed this show the first time around,and I am loving each and every episode. My sister has a daughter who is a freshman in high school and they are next in line to watch them. My 23 year old daughter wants to be next!! I can't wait to finish them and get on to the next season!!
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Okay, I did have the feeling I'd seen it all before, and indeed loved it all before as well, but what made this rendition of Allen's much-loved bittersweet melody so perfect for me were the performances, rich with irony and playful contradiction. As for the plot, don't expect anything flashy or even particularly sidesplitting, but if you enjoy, say, the quiet films of Erich Rohmer, you will savor this little tale as you would a fireside cognac. Thank you, Woody.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|I ordered this from Amazon and it would not load.  Exchanged it for another copy and the new copy will not load.  It starts to load and just stops.  I have about 50+ blu-rays and a new Sony player so it's not a matter of needing updates.  I received both copies within the last 2 weeks.  Anyone else experience this defect?
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Little Voice by Sara Bareilles amazes me. The songs are fantastic. She has worlds of talent and I love every minute of this CD. Sara can write, sing, and play the piano along with the best of them! She also plays acoustic guitar on this CD and Sara can do her own backup vocals, too. Moreover, the music is memorable; Sara can make a torch song sound like something straight out of heaven! The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork couldn't be better. The insert comes with all the songs lyrics and we get the song credits, too.<br /><br />\\"Love Song\\" provides the album with a particularly strong, somewhat angry song about a woman who tells her man that she wants to hold back and spare herself from being hurt more than she already is until she \\"(believes) that there's a reason to write (him) a love song.\\" Sara plays piano and does her own background vocals for \\"Love Song;\\" and those piano chords pound in such a way that we can hear the woman's pain. \\"Vegas\\" has a great melody--not to mention that arrangement! \\"Vegas\\" also explores a love affair that could be better; and again Sara's piano playing enhances this tune very well. \\"One Sweet Love\\" has a lush arrangement and Sara's excellent diction makes this even stronger. Sara is front and center; and she plays the acoustic guitar and the piano for this track. What a gripping love song!<br /><br />\\"Come Round Soon\\" rocks well with a touch of modern pop mixed in for a good effect; Sara sings this with her heart on her sleeve and it all holds its own very well. \\"Come Round Soon\\" deals with a woman pining for her man even though \\"he's taken and leaving.\\" \\"Come Round Soon\\" gets the royal treatment as Sara and her crew perform this; \\"Come Round Soon\\" is clearly a major highlight of this album. Listen also for \\"Between The Lines;\\" \\"Between The Lines\\" sounds great even though it's about a love that doesn't have much promise. Sara's piano arrangement helps the melody along and that's terrific.<br /><br />\\"Love On The Rocks\\" is about what you would expect it to be about; but Sara takes this song, adds in a slight touch of rock and pop and she actually makes it shine bright! \\"Many The Miles\\" stuns me with its beauty; Sara Bareilles sings this faultlessly with Javier Dunn and Josh Day on background vocals. \\"Many The Miles\\" deals with a woman's desire to be with her man; and it's another major highlight of this CD.<br /><br />\\"Fairytale\\" showcases Sara's talents; she sings and plays piano wonderfully. Sara is so talented; she can use her voice to convey all the emotions of the lyrics to \\"Fairytale.\\" The album ends strong with Sara Bareilles performing \\"Gravity;\\" \\"Gravity\\" is a tender ballad about a woman who thinks it's high time for her and her not-so-nice man to part ways. \\"Gravity\\" is done to perfection and it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Sara Bareilles gives us quite a lot on this album entitled Little Voice; and I predict that she'll be around to share her talents with us for many, many years to come. If you like this CD you may wish to get the two CD version of Little Voice. Of course, Sara's fans will want this CD and it makes a great place to start for people just discovering Sara Bareilles. In addition, people who like pop songs with some really cool jazzy piano playing thrown in will enjoy this album.ould expect it to be about; but Sara takes this song, adds in a slight touch of rock and pop and she actually makes it shine bright! \\"Many The Miles\\" stuns me with its beauty; Sara Bareilles sings this faultlessly with Javier Dunn and Josh Day on background vocals. \\"Many The Miles\\" deals with a woman's desire to be with her man; and it's another major highlight of this CD.    \\"Fairytale\\" showcases Sara's talents; she sings and plays piano wonderfully.

B001VL536I|4.0|After the plain poor performances of Requium and Power I was ready to watch just one more and hand in the request to end the subscription and move on. Infamous provded the needed kick to keep my interest for a few more. I need to see at least three consistent consecutive episodes with this quality to know somebody back at the group had been permanently let go. Looking forward to the future. Please don't dissapoint.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Alright, let's get this out of the way.  Is this story plausible or even probable?  Nope.  Having stated the obvious, let's move on.  This film is part fairytale & part fantasy but it's told under the cloak of realism.  Yes there are child prodigies and those who just have all kinds of musical kowledge stuffed into their heads.  I tend to see that kind of thing as a gift from God.  Do people hear music in every day living through ordinary sounds?  Of course.  I suggest that one not overthink this film.  It's not that kind of movie.  It's quite a fanciful tale but it really is very enjoyable.  Jonathan Rhys Myers is always wonderful and he does not disappoint here.  Robin williams is also very effective.  The music in this movie is eclectic.  If you don't like one tune you're bound to like one of the others.  This film took me by surprise.  There's no use in describing it to you.  Just read the synopsis and then view the film.  I found it quite interesting and men will probably see it as a \\"chick flick.\\"  Okay,so, no harm done.  If you're looking for car chases, guns and drugs, this isn't the movie for you.  This is more of a feel good type show.  Just take it for what it's worth and enjoy.  This film is rated pg.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I love this work out, specially the level-2. But Jullian is constantly talking in this video. It is very annoying and distracting. I have music on while I do this video, so that I can't hear all her chatter. Unfortunately, I can't mute her voice completely, because I need to know when to change in to the next progression of excercises. I do however recommend this tape.Very good workout and you will feel it in your arms and legs.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I'm always wary of hype, particularly with foreign films as there's always a requisite \\"movie snob\\" air to some of it, but in this rare case it's totally justified. THE best vampire movie and probably the best movie I've seen in a few years. Actually it is much more than a vampire movie, with equal parts coming-of-age, revenge and love.<br /><br />Cold, quiet and depressing, yet really touching with many scenes that stick with you. The two lead child actors are just amazing. They're able to convey so much just with expressions and movements that words aren't even necessary. I could watch the \\"come in uninvited scene\\" alone over and over again. Another fine point is the way some things aren't spelled out directly for us, allowing us to interpret as we see fit, as in the final scene. The filmmakers allow you to end it the way you feel it should.<br /><br />For the gore-hounds, the grue is here as well, but it's more tasteful than there for sheer shock value (though it's well appreciated in the final scenes, that's for sure!). I'm trying to remember the last time I've seen children killing and being killed on screen in some fairly graphic depictions and it's definitely escaping me. This seems to be a taboo subject in American films, but I glad for the open-mindedness of others as it works in the context this film.<br /><br />This is a movie that you will constantly be thinking about after seeing it and that is definitely the sign of a memorable piece of work. Everything comes together. Story, cinematography, setting, pace, direction. The whole package. My highest recommendation!<br /><br />On to the Blu-ray tech specs, I had rented the DVD first (I'm being more careful with blind buys these days) and the BD is a HUGE improvement over it. The BD's picture is razor sharp and seems to be free of DNR. This is a bleak picture due to the location, night scenes and winter setting, but the when colors do come into play they are much more accurate and deeper than the DVD. The blood looks truly realistic in color and texture now, almost disturbingly so, particularly the scene where it's running down Eli's face.<br /><br />The Swedish DTS-MA 5.1 audio is excellent as well. I definitely recommend avoiding the English dub. This is not a bombastic audio movie, but the dynamic range is excellent. You can almost hear the snowflakes tinkling in the opening and closing scenes and then get knocked out of your seat when a bus drives by on an overpass.<br /><br />Extras are nice if not substantial. We get four pretty good deleted scenes (I think they were in HD as well), a short but really informative making-of featurette and a couple of galleries for posters and still shots. I would've loved a commentary on this, as the director seems to speak fluent English in the featurette.olor and texture now, almost disturbingly so, particularly the scene where it's running down Eli's face.
