B002JVWRAO|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  I don't want to say to much and give away the content.  I will say this show really explores and bible and many religions very well.

B000HKW7E0|1.0|I can't believe so many people enjoy this series.  I couldn't finish watching this movie.  It had no life, no joy.
B007GFDVEE|4.0|This was a great gift for my grandson. He was very thrilled with it. I will be coming back to look for more
B006LSZECO|3.0|The early parts of the novel are over-written and self-conscious. The writer has a bad habit of writing paragraphs to make points that only merit a sentence or two. The shifting points of view initially feel contrived but end up working quite well. Overall, it is a clever story and good read with interesting, albeit annoying, characters.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|i had this cd  and left it in my leased car .but didnt realize it till the holidays came around.that it went with my car after turning it  in...was so happy to find it on amazon
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Simply put this film is a piece of trash.  It plays no tribute to the Batman legend at all.  Reviewers who dare call this even a good film can only be related to the film'sdirector.  The acting is stale.  The story line--if in fact there truly was one--was so confusing that it wasn't even worth the bother to figure out.  There were some minor saving graces but not enough to even hope that the people responsible for this film should have any business trying to restore our faith in the Batman legeng--or any legend--ever again.
B000W91RUG|5.0|very glad when i recieved this dvd..love the program..very funny im so glad they havent taken it off the air,,but if they do .the i will have these ..
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Another fantastic book by Eric Blehm; he has a way with words that transports you to the story scene. Mr. Blehm tells the story of Adam Brown in a way that makes the reader feel like you are with him and his story. I am so impressed with his writing that I didn't want the story to end. I felt that Mr. Blehm probably gave Adam Brown's family the best gift they could receive (other than his survival); the story of his brave and courageous life and his absolute love for his family and his country. An absolute phenomenal read...I thank you Eric Blehm.<br />lgs
B009NMLV9K|5.0|I am a James Bond nut. I am collecting all of them on blu ray. This one is a very good one.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Terrific album that makes listening a pleasure. Of course, you'd only enjoy this album if you enjoy exceptional lyrics, scoring and music.
B0012GMVDK|5.0|OK, I am 53. This is what happens to you when you listen to KFOG'S \\"10 at 10\\". I do know who Mark Cohen is. The thing is this. This song is way out of it's element when released. That is what I say having first listened to a couple of days ago. I thought it was a NEW Mark Knopfler, truly I did. The only way I found out was doing this, is because of 10 at 10.<br />****I think our new generation of youngsters should listen a bit more, before they SPEAK.****<br />Any ways, this song is about as good as it gets!<br />GREG
B008FPZQRO|1.0|I have tried again to listen to this, and I still find it nearly unlistenable. And I like Skinny Puppy, Zoviet France and Pauline Oliveros.[[ASIN:B008FPZQRO Tarkus (Deluxe Edition)]]
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  But the storyline must be improved if they want to continue this series. Some of the movie such as  the Ra's al Ghul connection was weak.  Michael Caine's and Morgan Freeman's performances were weak primarily because the script didn't give them very dynamic roles.  The movie writing needed more work.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Love the album! channel Orange is easily one of the best albums of the year. Can't wait for more music!
1933865474|5.0|A wonderful book for anyone that enjoys Bruce Timm's work. When I received my copy I was surprised to see that it was a large book filled with tons of pages. needles to say I was  very happy with this buy.
B000641D2Y|1.0|Merry Christmas, everyone!!<br /><br /> I saw this movie in theaters with my family back around Christmas of 1992, and being the easy-to-impress five year-old that I was, I loved the movie.  Like the first Home Alone movie, I would spend the rest of my childhood loving this movie without giving it much deep thought.  It wasn't until around two years ago that my fandom for this movie began to severely decline after applying good old logic to everything.<br /><br /> STORY<br /><br /> It's Christmas time again, and the MacCallisters are headed off to Florida to visit their family during the Holidays.  Again, Kevin gets into a scuffle with Buzz, this time at a school play when Buzz humiliates him on stage and Kevin knocks him down, causing a domino effect of other small disasters.  Again, Kevin's family targets him and scolds him for it.  They wind up late for the flight again, but are more caution to see that Kevin is actually with them, but Kevin ends up getting lost at the airport and gets caught on a flight to New York City.  The Wet Bandits break out of prison and end up in NYC, and plan on robbing a giant toy store in the Big Apple.<br /><br /> CHARACTERS<br /><br /> The characters in this movie make a total reversal in this sequel.  It's like Kevin's family forgot what they learned at the end of the first movie and reverted back to their old ways, and that the other characters in this movie feel far less believable in their actions.  Why would Kevin's family blame Kevin for causing the incident at the play when they saw in plain sight that Buzz caused it?  At this point, they're clearly being jerks against Kevin.<br /><br /> Also, the supporting cast doesn't fare better.  The homeless lady is clearly a rehash of Marley Murphy from the first movie, and the staff controlling the Plaza Hotel (headed by Mr. Hector, played by Tim Curry) are too easily fooled into admitting Kevin into the hotel.<br /><br /> This time, Marv and Harry seem more like generic comic foils than in the first movie, which totally works against the film's overall rating.<br /><br /> FORMULAIC STRUCTURE<br /><br /> I'm not joking, the plot structure for Home Alone 2 is exactly the same as the first one.  Just like with the first movie, Kevin gets into a predicament with his family, he gets lost from them, he encounters the Wet Bandits (who now call themselves the Sticky Bandits), he gets scared by a \\"scary\\" person who later becomes friends with, Kevin's family goes crazy to find him, Kevin sets up traps against Marv and Harry (this time, in his uncle's apartment under renovation), and I can keep going but I think I made my point clear.<br /><br /> LACK OF LOGIC<br /><br /> While there were some logical fallacies in the first Home Alone, the lack of logic in this movie is beyond absurd.<br /><br /> Kevin fools a Plaza Hotel receptionist into admitting him into the hotel through his Talkboy.  He first records himself and uses a voice distortion effect on the Talkboy to make his voice deep, but anyone with remotely decent hearing can know that the effect is clearly that, an effect.  In real life, the receptionist would have been on to something fishy and hung up.<br /><br /> Also, Marv and Harry hide out in Duncan's Toy Chest in two giant toy houses in the store in order to rob it without setting off security alarms.  They hide in there for at least a day or two, and more likely than not, the workers and/or security staff at the store would have noticed the two hiding out.<br /><br /> When Kevin gets lost in the more seedy parts of New York, he bumps into unsavory folks that look more like characters in a b-grade horror movie than a Home Alone movie.<br /><br /> I can keep going, but I think these illustrate my point well enough.<br /><br /> CONTINUITY<br /><br /> To be fair, some of the continuity in relation to the first one is decent and amusing in some parts.  The best parts of this have to be in relation to Marv and Harry recalling the past encounters with Kevin, such as when they grab him and Marv says to Harry \\"This time he doesn't have a house full of dangerous goodies.\\"<br /><br /> HUMOR<br /><br /> To be fair, there are some parts of the movie that pack in some good laughs, thus why this movie has a long ways to go before becoming a total goose egg.  I still laugh like crazy in the scene where Marv and Harry are in the apartment under renovation, and Harry pulls on the bathroom light switch, only to have a torch light his head, followed by him screaming and dunking his head in a toilet bowl full of gasoline.  The same can be said with the scene where they think they outsmarted Kevin when they ascend the staircase and dodge the flying paint cans, only to be greeted by a giant pipe wacking both of them in the face and falling through a giant hole in the floor.<br /><br /> Even outside of this phase of the movie, there's some funny parts, such as Kevin fooling Mr. Hector into thinking he's watching someone in the shower and uses a recording from Uncle Frank to scare him off, resulting in Mr. Hector running into a stool.<br /><br /> You don't have to watch the whole movie just for these parts, as you can find most (if not all) of these funny parts on YouTube.<br /><br /> CINEMATOGRAPHY<br /><br /> The cinematography of New York is quite pretty.  There's good shots of many landmark locations in the Big Apple, and it was pretty funny to see Kevin roam the city and see a man dressed as Santa walking on stilts to make him absurdly tall.<br /><br /> SOUNDTRACK<br /><br /> The music in Home Alone 2 is largely the same as that in the first movie, though there's some different choices in \\"traditional\\" Christmas tunes.  Even though the music sounds nice, it doesn't save the movie from its devastating flaws.<br /><br /> FINAL WORD<br /><br /> Perhaps if you're a person who doesn't mind watching movies through a nostalgic lens, you won't mind this movie.  However, if you're a film fan who cares about logic and proper character development, then you won't gain much from watching Home Alone 2.<br /><br /> Again, just save yourself a lot of time and go around YouTube for the funny parts of the movie.th Kevin, such as when they grab him and Marv says to Harry \\"This time he doesn't have a house full of dangerous goodies.\\"<br /><br /> HUMOR<br /><br /> To be fair, there are some parts of the movie that pack in some good laughs, thus why this movie has a long ways to go before becoming a total goose egg.

B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to use and complete. Usually has the information I am seeking. I love the daily information articles and word definitions
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|This is a must see every Christmas. We enjoy the humor and holiday spirit. It's tough to find clean humor fit for the whole family. We like this Home Alone the best!
B0095R64AO|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie, but it was so boring. I am normally a big fan of romantic comedies, but I fell asleep on the couch halfway through, mainly because I didn't want to watch it anymore. (Oh, come on. We've all done it at least once.) It was dry and just meh. Waste of money.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Anyone who enjoys suspense and a mystery to keep them guessing throughout would probably enjoy the book.  It is well written
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Kindle version of the book is awesome!  Four instead of five stars is because I didn't like the story as well as other Jane Austin books.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|If you enjoy Star Trek don't hesitate to pick this up! Has Blu-ray and original format of all the episodes from the original series.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I found this book engaging with new ideas rooted in research.  I have recommended it to many. Happy with my purchase.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Perfect for my father since he has always loved Indiana Jones and rates the hero at the same level as John Wayne. The box set is great and arrived expediently right before Christmas!<br /><br />This set is a MUST for any Indiana Jones fan or just to complete your collection.
B001ECE6C6|4.0|I rated this album with four stars because I thought the songs would be in English.  The liner notes are, but the Polish artists sing in their native language.  I still enjoyed the album .  PM is such a good guitar guy; any type of music he makes is always enjoyable.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Item exactly like I expect and we've been enjoying it for hours. Glad we bought it and my son is thrilled!
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This is a great cover for our Kindle Fire.  I am glad we chose this one.  It protects our Kindle and is convenient to use.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I was absolutely thrilled with this product. Just recently bought a 3D Vizio and was really looking for a movie to take advantage of the function. So many scenes in this movie that really pop in 3D.<br /><br />The quality, box art, all that's great. Getting four copies for the price is actually a great deal.<br /><br />On first watching the movie itself is pretty much what you would expect from an action / adventure scifi movie. But upon rewatching it a second and third time I really picked up on things I never noticed before. Things that made the story a bit clearer.<br /><br />There are a lot of questions that go unanswered by the end, I like that though. I like that this film asks questions and leaves it up to the viewer to come up with their own conclusions.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This was a great time for family to laugh out loud together.  This movie had us rolling over laughing.  I can't wait to revisit this story when my children have children and we watch it together.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help was awesome to say the least.  If it didn't win the Academy Award for best picture it should of.  A very believable story of life in the south at a time when the gap between the have and the have nots was huge

B00APUYWYA|2.0|i expected more from the movie.love the actors and actresses though. Movie didnt feel like it climaxed at all. It needed more for the talent that were in the movie.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|William Wilberforce was one of the greatest men in history. This movie, I think, does him great justice. It was beautifully-filmed, aptly-casted, and well-written.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire, but I prefer to just use the web browser most of the time. I just like it to look the way it does on my computer
B003F1WM2K|5.0|This was an interesting account of a friendship that endured the struggles of young NYC artists taking it day by day and taking opportunities as they arose. The sometimes gritty and unfamiliar lifestyle was actually inspiring to me in that I saw how resilient people are and how we somehow make it through, even when faced with a frighteningly uncertain future. I reflected on choices and circumstances and found the devotion to friendship and creativity admirable. It helped me understand Robert's unusual aesthetic and his need to find opportunities where available, although some choices would have grave consequences. Patti's rise to fame was encouraging and showed that life has a way of presenting new opportunities at every stage. I enjoyed this insight and find myself gleaning a bit of strength from it in an unexpected way.
145210655X|5.0|i like the art, the format, and the cleverness.  i can hear vader's voice in my head when i read it...

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the first two books in printed copy form.  This third book I bought to read on the Kindle. I was content with how the storyline ends.  Good read for the trilogy.
2070614816|5.0|The Harry Potter novels are a great way to learn a foreign language, and this reading is very well done, though a little fast.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|All I will say is if that was Tom really singing he has a great voice. The movie was horrible in my opinion. I hate Musicals.
B009POCG2C|4.0|I liked the previews and allows have been a Clint Eastwood fan, his last couple of movies he has mellowed out alot.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is a great reboot of the classic series.  The story is witty and inciting with an outstanding cast!
B001KQEA5E|5.0|Snoop began as the sidekick to Dr. Dre's classic debut and showed a lyrical focus and hunger the pushed his career foreward. His debut refined the sound forged on the Chronic. And it is an excellent lp to add to your collection...still!
B003UYV08E|5.0|I love this movie!! It is a fun sequel with a great story line and all my fav characters from the first movie.  A must have for the avenger's fan in your family!

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I was so excited to get this movie.  I have the whole series.  Was not excited about the kind of digital download however.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Dickens is one of the great all time writers. What else can you say.<br />Completely one of a kind! If you have not read it, you need to if you consider yourself \\"Well Read\\".
B006FPFTMS|5.0|THIS APP WORKS BETTER THAN OTHERS APPS I HAVE USED TO READ BOOKS ON MY TABLET, PLUS YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT YOUR BOOK FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. AND THE PRICE IS OK.
B00003CXBK|5.0|i rented this movie years ago on a dare. my friend said if i didnt love it he would  buy me a steak dinner. i liked it so much i bought him one. i purchased a copy last week and i have paused it to write this review. there is so much attention paid to detail i am seeing more this time than last. like at 38minutes 12seconds into it when lady eboshi is giving ashitaka a tour of irontown the man holding the stake turns his head during the hammer strikes. you just dont see that in most animated movies. well that being said i need to get back to the movie. i hope you enjoy it as much as i do and will next time i watch it. merry CHRISTmas.

B004LP3AYI|3.0|I have enjoyed the story line and creativity of the author, BUT I am VERY disappointed in the lack of editing.  This kindle book is filled with hundreds, HUNDREDS, of spelling/editing errors.  The editors, if they exist, don't know the difference between that and than, or affect and effect.  I DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS NOT EDITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005USZML4|5.0|Love the story and can't wait for the next one to come out. Hope it goes on and on.Love Grishams.
6304711905|5.0|This might be the most quotable movie of all time. Classic performances by Russell and Kilmer (seriously, where's the oscar nod for kilmer at least?). Great acting, beautifully shot and edited, never a dull moment.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The best book ever. I get really sad when I get to the end but that's real life for you.

I highly recommend this movie to all ages. I had this in vhs so I decided to get it in a dvd. It's one of my favorites
0547884591|5.0|First off, I've been a fan of his for years. His writing style works for me since humor is often injected, and while he writes passionately and seriously on each subject, he doesn't take himself overly seriously. This I appreciate.<br /><br />So 4 Hour Chef in particular was a lot of what I hoped it to be. One thing that has always kept me going back to reading his blog and other books is his love of learning and how he goes about doing so. My favorite section was Meta-learning. After having read 4 Hour Chef, I understand some reviews put on here. Let me be frank, this book is not for the faint of heart or those looking for quick and simple. It is written for us nerdy folks who LOVE to learn. It was written for those of us who have been disheartened too often by seemingly complex skills or deceptive perception others give us that something is difficult to learn.<br /><br />This book really has been a lot of fun to read, and enlightening. I've already in short order starting experimenting myself with certain learning techniques. It's still early yet, but I have cause to believe this really works. If you love learning, if you have been accused of being a hobby a month sort of person, or if you really want to finally figure out how to cook or pick up skills you never thought you would read this, and if you feel the urge to not read all, and just find the essential parts for you, then do it. He definitely wrote it for that in mind, knowing not all people are as a insatiably curious as I.<br /><br />Either way, definitely worth picking up, and oh, the pictures, graphs, etc. - gorgeous and very useful. While I personally am glad I got the print copy and not the kindle, because I don't know how well all this beautiful visual work would have shown up on that instead.<br /><br />Keep it up, Tim!<br /><br />Oh, and if Tim or a minion or friend of his ever reads this, my stepmom after I've evilly read large portions to her of this has asked for a 4 Hour Artist book (focused onart, music, etc.). I feel this book helps with that, and that some recent blogs touch on that as well. I did promise to pass it along in some way though. :)
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Another awesome album from Rodriguez. He evokes the sound of Dylan and Woody Guthrie but it is uniquely his own. I look forward to seeing him in concert this year!
B004NSVF7C|5.0|This was a great read.  I listened to it on public radio and then bought the book.  Really interesting, especially if you collect books, baseball cards, coins, etc.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very entertaining and is fun for all ages. Everyone should play this game. It is very fun.
B006O3MU96|2.0|I've been reading about Doodle Jump for years, so I figured I'd try it since it was free. Good thing it was free, because I'd feel taken advantage of it I had to pay for this game. Rotate the phone for directional jumping, tap the screen for directional shooting, jump up. Dumb. I just don't get it. Different strokes for different folks, I guess...
B009VB97EY|2.0|Horrible story line, just unwatchable except for Channing Tatum.  Never watching this type of movie again, just a waste of time and money

0812992784|5.0|I am a Rushdie fan, and of this book as well! It is moving, intelligent, beautifully written, enticing. And for someone like me who has been a Rushdie admirer for so long, it gives invaluable clues to the man  and his work.<br />I devoured the whole 600 pages of it and felt so sad when I finished it, like always with beautiful books.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I have been a music fanatic for more than 40 years and it takes an awful lot to knock my socks off these days. Since I have a huge CD collection that has most of it ripped to my two iPod Classics, I don't need to listen to the radio or watch TV. So while awaiting to attend an NFL game in the luxury lounge, I heard two great songs and immediately scribbled down key lyric lines for later research. Initially, I thought that these songs were from Foxy Shazam that I had not heard, or (God forbid) from the latest wet noodle by the Beach Boys. My research revealed nothing at all (definitely not Beach Boys, thank goodness).<br /><br />Fast forward a few weeks and a young co-worker was playing one of these songs within earshot. I jumped out of my chair to ask him who it was and he informed me. I then checked sound clips and bought this album in the mall that evening. It turns out that the two songs that impressed me first were We Are Young and Some Nights. The rest of the album is also a masterpiece! VERY POSITIVE, but with hints of wild behavior! I would say that Foxy Shazam, Queen, and the Beach Boys are heavy influences (and I HATE the Beach Boys!!!). This group has taken great vocal harmonies and melded it with big samba drum sounds to create this awesome positive anthemic masterpiece that deserves the six Grammy nominations. Anyone who hates this one needs to see a shrink!  I may not have found out about this group until ten months after this release, but better late than never.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Captivating, on your toes kind of book. I loved every moment of this book and it's classic tale of love, passion and acceptance. I recommend this book to anyone who has a thing for classics.
B008F9E306|2.0|T.I.  has had a  good  run  and his older  stuff  has  held  pretty well,  however  now in 2012  there isn't  much he  can do to match  the best of that past  decade. the colabs on paper  are cool and  diverse, however the results are  pretty  predictable and while  T.I. has a couple of decent moments, the best thing i have ever dug about the cat is the Production on his projects and this one is just aight. however he will get a  pass for what he has established thus  far.  but this album feels like a contract obligation to me. could and should have been  better.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I like it except for the fact it does not completely load the statuses. It is very irritating because I can only read a few and then there's no use continuing. Therefore I go back to using my iPhone.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Like everyone else who commented I long anticipated hearing the other songs of this movies having been tempted by the trailer with Ann Hathaway singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". First, about the content. As others commented, I too am disappointed that some key songs were not included. Granted, this is suppose to be a highlights album, even highlights from the Broadway production have included songs like \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" and \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\". (If you can fit the entire Beethoven 9th symphony on one CD, then I don't see why you can't get more songs in a \\"highlights\\" album.)<br /><br />Next, the singing. Not sure this \\"live\\" transfer is the most acoustically effective process. The supporting cast sound marvelous (Marius, Cosette, Eponine). In my opinion, Hugh Jackman sounded better in Oklahoma and Boy From Oz, but his \\"Bring Him Home\\" sounded solid. Sasha Cohen sounded weak and had some intonation issues. Ann Hathaway, who knew she could sing? We know for sure Crowe can't sing, although he did sound slightly better than Pierce Brosnan did in Mamma Mia.<br /><br />I you have an interest in this sound track, I suggest the $5 MP3 format. Don't think the selection, sound quality, inconsistent singing is worth the full CD price.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|At ch. 7 the items of interest are either not clickable or the click box is tiny and off center of the item (so you can't reliably make the item active).  Impossible at this point to continue the game.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I was able to take pictures of Santa and fix the little inconsistencies before showing the photos to my son
B009SCRERI|5.0|Nothing too scary or sad, nothing inappropriate or gross. Sweet, wholesome goodness. Not to mention the beautiful artwork and animation, the great storyline and dialogue, and the decent to good musical score. I usually end up disappointed or angry about kids' movies because they're either lame on all fronts, gross (excessive potty humor), or way too scary for anyone 14 and under. This is entirely the opposite! We will watch this one again and again.<br /><br />I've never seen another series of children's animated movies continue to improve the way the Tinker Bell franchise has done. I have loved each movie, but 'Wings' is the very best. The characters and their world continue to expand and deepen. Pixie Hollow is heading toward the immersive levels of Hogwarts and Middle Earth, but for a younger audience.<br /><br />Hope Disney keeps up the great work! Can't wait to see the next one!
B008MEM24S|1.0|ok did not use app at all meant to download the free version I did not want the .99 cents version. I did find the free one and then downloaded the correct one
B0073PPKNM|1.0|Save your $.  Stan Getz and João Gilberto /  Astrud Gilberto already covered the same ground in 1964.  And they did it much better.  What on earth was Gardot thinking?  Awful.  And I completely enjoyed her first two albums.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|Would have given five stars but almost all sleeves were dented and marked. Also revolver and both white album discs have smudging and minor scratches, which is mildly disappointing. Overall it is a beautiful set which I would recommend
B005LAII62|2.0|The stop-motion animation is great, very well done technically, but ... this movie is really quite slow, tedious and not that interesting for adults, although it had an interesting start. Turns out there are maybe less than half a dozen funny bits (the best of which was the guy waiting for the vending machine to dispense his chips while Zombies are advancing on him - that was funny). It is really tailored to kids who will be amused by the animation, although they may be scared by the really angry witch girl - those scenes may be too intense for younger kids. But I was quite disappointed in the mostly uninspired action and overall plot. The van chase in the middle was blah. So why did RottenTomatoes (RT) give it an incredible 86% positive rating?<br /><br />There is actually an interesting message apart from the usual \\"don't hate me because I'm different\\". Norman pleads with one character not to give in to the same anger and hatred which she experienced. This is interesting in a time where \\"peaceful\\" and \\"tolerant\\" folks are publicly calling for death or violence upon people who simply disagree with them - calling for global warming deniers to be executed (or blown up, in a now-famous ad), or for the NRA leadership's heads on pikes, or hinting that corporate CEOs should be assassinated (all just in good fun, of course). Kudos to the writers for daring to include this message, although it probably falls on deaf ears.<br /><br />This movie is somewhat about the Salem witch trials. You may want to read up on the actual history (not \\"pop\\" history) of it to be able to answer questions about it. Be aware, though, that Hollywood portrayals of it are usually overblown. Less than 40 were executed for witchcraft in the States, at the height of the hysteria, unlike in Europe, where the calming power of the Church was absent to curb the epidemic. (Yes, it was the Church - ironically, the Spanish Inquisition! - that brought sanity and skepticism to the widespread charges of witchcraft.)<br /><br />Oh, and true to the stern dictates of Hollywood, there is a gay kid, although you don't find out until the end. Whether this makes it \\"family friendly\\" is up to you, but there it is. It's not a big part of the movie, though - more like a punch line.<br /><br />On the whole, for a 86% RT rating, it's quite a disappointment. If you have lower expectations, you may enjoy it more.craft.)<br /><br />Oh, and true to the stern dictates of Hollywood, there is a gay kid, although you don't find out until the end.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|Regardless of how many times you watch 'Christmas Vacation', it will leave you laughing in tears. The Griswald family at their best and at Christmas, nonetheless.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|First of all, if you're not used to British-isms, you may want to turn on subtitles.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie that is touching in several aspects. There is the aging Santa who cannot quite grok that it's time for someone else to take the reins. There is the tech-savvy new heir apparent who does not get the recognition he deserves. And the screw-up with a big heart. Their Christmas is complicated by the fact of an undelivered toy, which brings out differing responses from each, and it's these reactions that make them quite human.<br /><br />It's fun to watch the elves on their commando-style operations to get toys to all the kids. And the animation is flawless. There is enough humor and heart to keep you hooked.<br /><br />But there are many stretches where you seem to be bombarded with non-stop noise, albeit a lot of it may be frantic dialogue. These stretches can be auditorily exhausting.<br /><br />Some bits can get tedious, trying to get to the point.<br /><br />The character design and texturing could have been much better. Grandpa Claus looks positively creepy, almost scary and out of place. The elves look rather bland and boring due to their huge, round faces and tiny, far-apart eyes. I found it hard to look at them.<br /><br />Still, a fun, family movie, if these issues don't drive you batty.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am always trying to find a calculator and this is easy to get to and see with large numbers.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so fun I play it every day. you should totally get it. first its free and it shouldn't be and second well its just awesome
B00633W614|5.0|It picked up where the first left off but the characters were more developed in the second book and the story more interesting
034580404X|5.0|Maybe these books are not the best well written books but they are sure entertaining and can keep you distracted for a long time.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I saw one of her song's on yahoo and decided to check out this album. I'm not a huge fan of this type of music normally but I loved this album from start to finish! I love to listen to this while gaming or on my way to work. If you've never hear Grimes before this is a great place to start!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!! Hilarious, corny cast - Gotta watch it at least once every Christmas season and the family agrees :o)
B0076DEJMO|5.0|If you liked all the other books in this series your going to love this one! Get ready for the return of some classic characters and some new friends. I loved it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun but really challenging! hard not to love! I sureley reccomend this game. dh Dvd he she bus
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Despicable Me” begins with the truth that villains are often more fascinating than heroes and creates a villain named Gru, who freeze-dries the people ahead of him in line at Starbucks and pops children's balloons. Although he's inspired by many a James Bond bad guy, two things set him apart: (1) His vast mad scientist lair is located not in the desert or on the moon, but in the basement of his suburban home, and (2) He dreams not of world control so much as merely dominating the cable news ratings as the Greatest Villain of All Time.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This is a good movie that definitely made me blush and that's hard to do. I highly recommend it to any woman!
B008220CYM|4.0|This movie was really good.  Lots of action, but also had a lot of violence.  It takes place in Pittsburg, where a former military sniper appears to routinely pick off several people as they walk down the street.  When the police question him, all he can say is \\"Get Jack Reacher.\\"<br /><br />Through the investigations and the trists and turns, amid car chases and kick-butt action, we watch things unfold.  Tom Cruise portrays his usual great-screen image and the movie is well worth seeing.  Later in the film,you will understand how Jacker fits in.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a good movie about mother and daughter tiffs. It reminded me of conflicts with my mom but with a more story book heart felt ending.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Basically, if you are a novelist and want to see these movies as they were 20 years ago, go on ebay and buy the VHS copies.  However, if you want a crisp, clear picture go with the blue ray.  I went with the latter and am blown away.  Don't listen to the haters.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I have loved all of the Men in Black movies and it surprises me they were able to keep the humor, action and story line in 3 movies.

B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I really enjoy the series. I have seen them all, but I don't think is the best one. It was entertaining, but the story line felt incomplete. Almost like they had a lot they wanted to put in and not a lot of time. I really enjoy that they are implementing more and more characters from the video game series.<br /><br />Not much else to say, if you go in with expectations of good action, and just looking for entertainment I doubt you will be disappointed.
0439023513|2.0|I thought the book was alright right up until the ending. I feel as if the author just got bored writing and threw something together for a quick finish.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is the first book that I've read from this author, and based on a few personal quirks, I'll likely not buy another book by Flynn.  I bought this book for my Kindle because of the bestseller status and the magnitude of reviews this book accumulated. I wanted a good intriquing mystery.  Summed up below is what was delivered.<br /><br />Here are the good parts you get: 1) detailed characters, 2) dual points-of-view knitting a tight-webbed plot, 3) unexpected turns-of-event.<br /><br />Here are the not-so-desirable parts you get:  1) main characters developed with a lost cause to the storyline, 2) abrupt ending, 3) unnecessarily vulgar dialogue.<br /><br />This is not a book for young teens; it COULD have been a great suspenseful read for my 14 year-old daughter if Flynn would have left out the repeated four-letter words and trashy thought processes that had no plausible effect to the overall book.  I'm not squemish to profanity, but I do not like overusage if there is no reason for it in terms of character/plot development.<br /><br />This is a book for people who enjoy decoding a webbed plot of turning events.  I found this to be a real page-turner and a rapid read.  I became entangled in the story and repeatedly found myself deciding about who did what.<br /><br />Every person who reviews this way is telling you the truth....horrible ending. I couldn't believe when I clicked the Kindle over that I was at \\"Acknowledgements.\\"  It's like another reviewer stated; Flynn basically seemed like she got tired of writing.  It's a dropoff and you will find yourself concluding the story on your own terms.<br /><br />Overall a good read at 3.5 stars.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Yes, you get to see some gorgeous men with their shirts off, but the story is boring and the acting is bad.
0618680004|5.0|I am still reading the book, but decided to take a look at the reviews and it seems like there is a consensus on the negative ones that Dawkins uses the actions of specific \\"bad seeds\\" to dishonor religions. That prompted me to write the text below in reply to one of the posts. When I finish reading the book, I will come back and write a more complete review, but decided to post that reply here for now...<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I think what Dawkins wants to show is that \\"religion\\" has become the excuse to get away with things one would never get away with if they didn't use religion as their \\"cover.\\" And yes, it is frustrating to see all the things that have become somewhat acceptable just because they are a part of a religious belief system. In my view, he isn't necessarily saying \\"Hey, Christianity is horrible because of the Holy Inquisition'\\" he is saying \\"Look at what people can get away with under the cover of being Christians!\\" The same goes for the things done by Islamic followers and all other religious fanatics. Religion ends up becoming a protective cover under which fanatics are allowed to act. And I have to say I share Dawkins' frustration on this matter. It would be nice to live in a world where people could not hide behind the powerful cover of religion to get away with horrible, unacceptable things...<br /><br />And, just for the record, I was raised catholic, went to catholic school, and such. But I have to say that, although the thought of some all-powerful entity looking after me and leading me down a path sounds comforting, especially through difficult moments, I came to find it childish. Not to mention that the thought of believing that such divine being is spending \\"his\\" (??) time focused on my little old self and my little (and petty) existence feels to me beyond being egocentric.<br /><br />By reading the book, I came to realize I am actually what would be considered a pantheist. I believe the real \\"god\\" to be the energy that moves all and is present in all. It is neither a he or a she, and it has no thought or judgment. You either flow with it, or try to swim against it, and flowing with it may make life better and fuller, or not. The real sins to me are destroying the world, overpopulating the planet, disrespecting other animals (yes, other because we are also animals, although some people try to deny it based on, yes, religion), and so forth.<br /><br />It is funny to me that so many deeply religious people think having a lot of children is acceptable in this day and age. Times change and we have to follow these changes. Just as we are experiencing an epidemic of obesity because we have reached a technological point where we no longer have the physical demands we have had in the past, but still have the instincts to eat the way we did, we are now \\"over-feeding\\" the world with humans because we still have the instinctual need to reproduce, even though we no longer need to do so in order to survive as a species. If we could be more in tune with what and where we are, instead of old rituals, we should be able to enjoy fuller and healthier lives.<br /><br />People say God made man, but as I age, it becomes so clear to me that the reality is the exact opposite. I wish one day religious people will come to respect non-religious people at the same level they expect us to respect them. And I hope one day humanity will reach a point where religions and these beliefs will no longer be needed so we can all move on to greener pastures and away from all the hatred, wars and self-entitlement religions seem to bring about. Let us all be responsible for our own actions and appreciate life for what it is, also accepting that death is a fact no religion will change.<br /><br />One beautiful thing I read on the book was something like: \\"Is it not enough to appreciate and enjoy a beautiful garden for what it is, without having to believe elves and fairies must live in it?\\"
B008YWY0HK|5.0|quickly become a Disney favorite- we went to Disney a week after purchasing this and there was already reference to Princess Merida in the park (especially Frontier's land)<br /><br />Princess Merida is a firey red-head who does not want to be promised as a bride to another Irish clan- she fights with her mother and then runs away from the castle only to find a witch in a wooded cave. Merida makes a deal with this witch who casts a spell on Merida's mother (who wants her to marry another clan's son and unite two Irish tribes). Merida's mother becomes a bear- if they can't reverse the spell in enough time the spell will become permanent.<br /><br />I am an adult Disney fan and I found parts of this movie VERY scary and inappropriate for young children. The bad character (Merdu the bear) was terrifying- very scary- and the fight scenese with said bear were equally uncomfortable.<br /><br />There are a few Irish songs in this movie but nothing very catchy that left you wanting to replay them with children or do a sing-a-long.<br /><br />What I did find interesting of this movie is: there is no love interest. Merida is the heroine - and there is no male lead to come in and help her save the day. There is no prince for this princess - and she is just A OK (more so) with that. I thought this was very 21st century of Disney and feel they are very Brave for putting out a movie/story such as this.<br /><br />Overall, this will be another Disney classic but does not meet the ranks of some of the other Disney hits (such as Nemo or Tangled).

As long as you have a decent device (at least a htc thunderbolt *mecha). Works great on the nexus 7 so yeah its worth the $. Should run perfectly on a kindle fire. :)<br /><br />10/10

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Well I had already bought this on the android market when it was on sale for 10 cents (think it was) or. 99 either way it's worth the price of the normal cost! The music and graphics are beautiful, I didn't experience any lag or too much of a battery drain (I'm using the HTC Amaze &lt;--known battery hog) and the game play does get a bit more challenging as you progress but it isn't too hard. Leaving reviews aren't really my thing, sorry. Give it a chance its an amazing game ^_^
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Already so many great reviews for these headphones, might as well add another.<br /><br />These things have so much street credibility its insane.  I read and watched several reviews and there are almost no negative things said about them and I feel the same way.<br /><br />Been using them a few days, wearing them for many hours, they are comfortable and sound great.<br /><br />Don't buy into hype of celebrity branding, companies like Sony have been making proven products for decades.  Actually impresses me when a model number sticks around for years (the packaging for the pair I bought said it was designed in 1994...)

B0083P1QUM|4.0|I found this book to be a bit technical but quite interesting from start to finish.  Patricia Cornwell is very good at creating visual images, and I find that sets her apart from other mystery writers.  She takes the time to paint the picture in which the action takes place.  Towards the end, I almost called out loud to tell her to back away from the almost-certain danger, so I'd have to say I was invested in the plot. Good read.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|It is an excellent movie for both children and adults.  Great Family movie.  More meaningful family movies such as this one should be made.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|Fits in well with the motion picture and seems to bring the scenes together<br />creating the desired effect , suspense and execution.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|The acting is supurb, the writing, costumes and all that are top notch, but I am old enough to remember getting in an elevator in Manhattan and everyone lighting up and by this time in the series these guys weren't hip any longer- they were getting to be on the nose and a few years later they were decidedly old hat.  It is too bad, but that was the 1960s and by the 70s these people were so out of touch with the youth culture they didn't matter anymore.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Book chosen because I have enjoyed many books by this author,  It was entertaining but not as compelling as some of his other novels.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I can hardly wait for the next one. I know they are kids books but I enjoy them too and I'm an adult.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|As a young girl growing up in Vermont, we treated everyone with respect.  I never moved to the south till in my 20's and by then most of what is written here was gone.  But some still feel this way sorry to say.<br /><br />It was a real eye opener for me reading the story, how could people treat their hired help with such disrespect.  Especially when they were so busy being the social butterfly and leaving the beautiful children to be raised by another.<br /><br />If you haven't grown up in the South, this book is a real eye opener.

B00275EHJG|4.0|This is a nice movie to watch by your self or someone else. No cares on worries just sit back and enjoy. Good story line. the Right characters for the their rolls.
B004TI5N38|2.0|This is a poor attempt at copying Lee Child's military style here Jack Reacher.  I knew from the reviews that the character would be \\"Reacher-like\\" but was surprised to find Baldacci has copied him right down to his physique.  Beyond the obvious copycat issues, the characters are wooden, the dialogue is extremely flat.  I've never thought Baldacci was especially good at characterization, but usually his quick paced and well thought out plots with the exciting twists and turns balances that out a little.  Not so in Zero Day.  This book is a big disappointment.  I will finish, but only because I am finding the poor writing and absurd attempts (during one ridiculous sidebar, Puller whips out a previously unmentioned medical talent during which he assesses a woman's meds and starts an iv for her while awaiting the paramedics, thereby saving her from an eminent heart attach)at rounding out the main character to make him seem even a little likable and life-like to be so amusing.  Wake up David Baldacci!!!
B001AQR3JY|4.0|It's fun for everyone.that wants to watch a movie that you don't have to worry that someone is going to say bad words or kill someone.

B002KVCA1O|5.0|Most albums don't seem to have many &#34;best of&#34; songs on them, but this one has.  This is one of the best albums I've ever bought.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|my husband loves the movies...just put in a theater room so  it looks great on the big screen. thank you
B00AA7O22U|5.0|What's not to like, guns, classic action heroes, one liners, and explosions. Defiantly not a chick flick. I need more works in here and I don't want to be creative this early to keep reading I you don't understand
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Although it took a while to develop the normal captivating read, the book was engrossing and typical of the authors previous books. That being said, I truly enjoy all of the Preston/Child books and look forward to every new release.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|It was so bad that I browsed the web on my tablet while it was playing.<br /><br />This is what I remember about the film: 1. Plenty of gunfire, 2. everybody's hair looks great even after the most intense battles, 3. Ada Wong's dress; it'll look good on my girlfriend and 5. Michelle Rodriguez looks really great in tight jeans and heels that she can barely walk in.
044022425X|4.0|OK, was trying to be cute. Wow! Read this quite some time ago and had to think about it. Gabaldon does an exceptional job of weaving her stories - have followed the entire series, mostly through books loaned to me by friends. Didn't think I would like the time travel aspect of her stories, but must say that she &#34;sucked&#34; me in to them, and Jamie can knock on my door any time he wants!
B0076DELIG|3.0|A bit far-fetched, turning a dedicated and somewhat cerebral detective into a vigilante.  Michael Connelly is a superb writer, economical and focused with his narrative and dialogue.  But this story somehow goes too far and loses some credibility.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Love White Collar! Worked easy on my smart TV. Just had a few problems with the Amazon instant player sometimes.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|An ok movies with no curves !  Very predictable over acted by Clint and most characters are over blown but if you like baseball you will enjoy it. Tjs
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book, and gives you great insight into the life of a true hero.  The only caution I would give people is that it does contain a lot of profanity, so be cautious if that offends you.  But it didn't bother me in context and I totally enjoyed the book!
B006FE83V8|5.0|I don't think anybody would question the greatness of the movie.  It just seems to hit on every level, from a screenplay artfully edited from the classic Harper Lee novel, to terrific and believable performances by everybody, especially the child actors; a great score by Elmer Bernstein; the spooky, wordless film debut of Robert Duvall; and of course Gregory Peck as the menschiest cinematic Dad of all time.  It's an unsparing look at racism, put forth before Martin Luther King had a dream, and before the Civil Rights Act.  A classic, and an essential film.<br />The 50th anniversary repackaging is terrific -- it includes a Blu-Ray with a stunning picture and good sound, a standard def DVD, a downloadable digital copy which looks great on my MacBook and iPad, and a batch of nice extras.  The Blu-Ray comes with a batch of making-of featurettes, a retrospective of Gregory Peck's career, and a Q&A session in which Peck reminisces about his career, especially the making of Mockingbird.  And the booklet has essays by Peck's wife Veronique, by Harper Lee, and -- this is especially nifty for actors out there -- reproductions of three pages of Peck's personal copy of the shooting script, with his dense annotations, edits, and notes which show the prodigious work that went into this remarkably low-key, understated performance.  it's revelatory to watch the scenes in question with the script in front of you.  An essential ressiue of an essential movie.
8862933177|5.0|The journal is awesome. I loved how it had many spare pages at the back and that it gave all these stickers that gives you ideas for the other pages such as memorable scenes. The whole journal can be inspirational and will give good memories for the movies that you see :)
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Are you looking for a family friendly (adults AND children), with warmth, humor and intelligence? This one is a winner.

B006ZNRD06|5.0|I downloaded the app to my Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  I converted a DVD I own on my computer using AnvSoft software that has an option to output a video for Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  Loaded it to my Fire using the USB connection, dropping the video (MP4) into the video folder.  Then opened the app on my fire and watched the movie.  The resolution was great.  The sound was in sync with the picture.  The Fire never crashed.  I was able to stop it and then later pick up where I left off.<br />Seems to be working great.  I downloaded the free app and have not had any issues with it asking me to purchase the pay app.  I'm not sure how long it takes for it to do that (as people have complained in other reviews).  I bought the app on Oct. 2 and it is now Christmas.<br />What can I say, working great!  Thanks!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Awesome movie, great action and special effects.  Sorry this is the last movie in the trilogy.  Bane was an awesome character!

B008ELUEQC|5.0|I would recommend this to everybody, but especially the millions of Rod Stewart fans. His solos, the duets, David Foster's production, everything about it is fantastic. I have listened to it so much that if it was an old vinyl record it would be worn out!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried at least three different weather apps for my new Kindle Fire but this one is by far the best . . . and, it's free!! I really love the radar feature as well as the worldwide selection of locations.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After seeing the movie with the wife, she talked me into getting the trilogy.<br />I am glad she did...we were on a 7 day cruise and I was able to read on my Kindle during the down time.<br />The book was awesome and read really fast. I was hard pressed to pt it down, Made some things in the movie make a bit more sense...now I can not wait till the next movie comes out!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  She has to be one of my favorite authors.  I thought slammed was my favorite but now I'm not so sure.  This is probably my favorite boom of 2012.  I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down!  I can't wait for her next book

B006O3MU96|5.0|I don't know what else to say. I was unsure at first about the app but when I started playing I was instantly hooked. this game is simple and wonderful but most of all simply addictive.
0060012358|4.0|This discworld book is funny and engaging and an excellent read.  The plot is simple:  some rats and a cat have gotten into a wizards' dump and became intelligent, and now they travel from town to town doing a pied piper routine.  That is, the intelligent rats go into people's houses and freak them out, and then a boy working with them comes along and plays a pipe and draws them all away, for money. But now the rats are developing a conscience, and they don't want to rip people off anymore.  So they all agree to take one more town to the cleaners and then call it quits.  But Bad Blintz isn't like other towns.  Something strange is going on there, and it will take all the intelligence of the rats, the cat and the boy to figure out what it is and deal with it.  They find an ally in the mayor's daughter, Malicia, and must take on several dangerous enemies, and along the way they deal with issues of leadership, religion, faith in each other and faith in the stories they've created for themselves to live by.<br /><br />This book is intended for younger readers, but I'm a 48 year old man and enjoyed this book just fine.  It's written at a high level and will be challenging for younger readers as well as fun for adults.  The book is set in Terry Pratchett's discworld, but you don't need to know a thing about the discworld to enjoy the book.  Everything you need is explained in the book itself, you don't need to have read a single other discworld book.  Settle in, snuggle up and enjoy!
B0012NVGHU|1.0|I had heard good things about this movie from friends and seen some good reviews. I just finished watching it as a rental, and the only good thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't spend another $10 to see this in the theatre or buy a DVD. I felt incredibly bored through the entire movie. I also found the songs completely unappealing, and in fact irritating to sit through. There were parts where I couldn't make out the dialogue due to the accents, so that didn't help.  I forced myself to finish watching to see if it got better in the end, since so many people seem to like this movie. It didn't get any better. This was just a complete waste of time and money.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|good app everyone has it 2 people on the comments said it was a bad game so I prove them rough
B008220D0U|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br />As usual, Tom Cruise is getting picked on by many as not suitable for this role.  And as usual, he's perfect.  OK, so he's not 6' 5\\" or whatever as portrayed in the novels from which the story is extracted.  Still, author Lee Child is said to be fine with the casting.<br /><br />Reacher (Cruise) is a highly decorated former soldier whose last job was a military detective.  After his discharge Reacher disappears, for whatever reason.  The film opens with an effective sequence of a sniper setting up in a high rise parking garage across from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium.  He manages to pick off 5 individuals seemingly at random, but also leaves enough clues that the police headed by detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly arrest a suspect (Joseph Sikora).<br /><br />Barr (Sikora) is severely beaten during a jail transfer.  While hospitalized he asks his attorney (Rosamund Pike) to \\"get Jack Reacher.\\"  As it turns out Reacher finds Helen (Pike), her father (Richard Jenkins) who is also the DA and Emerson.  Director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie manages to lead the audience along with Reacher sifting through the clues with more attention than the police.  McQuarrie even tosses in a couple Hitchcock-like \\"McGuffins\\" to complicate matters.<br /><br />Clearly something is amiss and the film shifts gears into a corruption fed financial ploy.  As the bad guys target Reacher, he goes into combat mode.  He's highly skilled.  As the primo gangster, Werner Herzog proves he's as effective in front of the camera as behind it.  His Teutonic, one-eyed take of a prison survivor is memorable.  We do get the usual amount of gun play but it is mostly concentrated in scenes involving Reacher and an aging, newly acquired friend (Robert Duvall) attempting to rescue a kidnapped Helen.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect as a couple of the scenes just seemed to be pasted in at the last minute to clarify something that happened earlier.  But there are other surprises that keep things interesting and helps make this action/thriller a cut above the norm.er surprises that keep things interesting and helps make this action/thriller a cut above the norm.
097747609X|1.0|Has anybody actually got this on Kindle fire? Every time I click the Kindle like it takes me to a 1939 photo book. That's not the one I want... Just curious to see if anybody has gotten it or is it marked wrong.
B008220D7S|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br />Director/writer Judd Apatow appears to have a firm grip on this style of raunchy, funny adult comedy.  This is a sequel of sorts to \\"Knocked Up.\\"  Katherine Heigl's character, Alison was the sister to Debbie (Leslie Mann).  Moving a few years forward, Debbie and husband Pete (Paul Rudd) are both about to hit 40 in the same week.<br /><br />Pete is dealing with it gracefully, having his hands full with a stumbling record label he owns.  Debbie wants no part of 40 and even has 38 on her birthday cake.  Her clothing store is barely breaking even and she suspects one of the employees is stealing money.  Both have to deal with two daughters (Apatow and Mann's daughters Maude and Iris).<br /><br />While Pete and Debbie still love each other, their marriage is growing stale to the point where sex is a chore by one or the other.  In one funny scene Debbie stands in front of Pete with one boob peeking out of her neglig&eacute;e trying to get a response.  One of the biggest surprises is Megan Fox who plays one of Debbie's clerks.  Sexy as she is, she also comes across as a great \\"straight man\\" in her scenes.  Who knew?<br /><br />This film is full of brief scenes of some of TV, film and music stars of the day.  Of note, for you aging rockers out there, is British blues/rock legend Graham Parker who is Pete's only signed artist.  Also, Melissa McCarthy steals her scenes as an obnoxious mother of a boy who has been harassing Pete and Debbie's daughter.  Be sure to stick around for the closing credits to see some outtakes of McCarthy ranting in the school principal's office.<br /><br />Apatow has plenty of uncomfortable scenes, depending on your tolerance level.  Most will squirm when Debbie has to check Pete for a potential hemorrhoid.  Still, very funny.  There are plenty of F-bombs to go around including many from the 13 year old daughter.  The film lacks a cohesive theme and seems to wonder a bit.  This adds to an unnecessarily lengthy film (134 min.)  Quentin Tarantino has something in common with Judd Apatow even though their movies don't.  With both you pretty much know what you're going to get.  This can be a positive or a negative depending on your perspective.Quentin Tarantino has something in common with Judd Apatow even though their movies don't.

B007HACDLK|4.0|I've read every Vince Flynn book. This is one of my favorites. It's action packed and hard to put down.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|What can I really say other than I have read all three book and I own the swedish version of the movies on blu-ray when I went to see this movie in theatures a little dissapointed but overall a good movie.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A compelling story that we all wish we could call our own. It made me seriously think of completing my own quest in nature to find out just what I'm made of.  Highly recommended it to my 22 year old daughter.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I am sure everyone was a little let down by this movie but I think it's not as bad as it was reviewed.
B0071R43MG|5.0|Great Blu-ray. I agree the 3D version is \\"eh\\".  I have a Panasonic VT25, so 3D can look really good on it, but in this case it's not needed.  I found it odd that my blu-ray copy didn't list a 3D option; you simple turn on your 3D capability on the tv and blu-ray loads the 3D version.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but its definitely not something I would get exided over so don't be one hundred percent shire about it.!

B006O6F932|1.0|It's expensive.  The plastic is cheap.  The snap together staircase doesn't fit or stay in the holes because the plastic is malformed.  Gargoyles fall off the pedestals.  Dolls slump over in the school chairs. DJ system falls over. The second story, even with the gussets, if you touch it bends.<br /><br />On the box, when unit says collapsable for easy storage.  Did they mean in the garbage?  Because you move any of the walls it falls apart.  The clips that hold the two main pieces together is brittle.  We have it braced up against the couch so my daughter can play with it.<br /><br />Not up to expected standards of quality.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was wow, a lot to take in (but in a good way). Sky makes out with guys to feel numbness, and the first time she meets Holder she feels something, her friend well goes into shock. \\"Sky, I've been worried about you for four years, thinking this would never happen. I would be fine if you were gay. I would be fine if you only liked skinny, short, geeky guys. I would even be fine if you were only attracted to really old, wrinkly men with even wrinklier penises. What I haven't been find with is the thought of you never being able to experience lust.\\" This book had so much humor between Holder and Sky which is why I truly enjoyed reading this book. \\"Not that I wouldn't hit on you,\\" he adds with a grin. \\"I just wasn't doing it at that particular moment.\\" Sky isn't a normal teen, her mom doesn't allow tv, cell phones, or even the computer and Holder finds the activities she does to keep her busy amusing. \\"So you get the house to yourself and you spend Friday night baking? Typical teenager,\\" he says mockingly. The most amusing quote I found was when Sky was introducing Holder to her gay, Mormon, best friend Breckin. \\"Breckin this is Holder. Holder is not my boyfriend, but if I catch him trying to break the record of best first kiss with another girl, then he'll soon by my not breathing non-boyfriend.\\" Job well done Colleen I really enjoyed this book! Hope to see more from you!
B005ANZN3G|5.0|Now, let me bee very clear..... most classical music DVD's must have been processed by Thomas Edison, they are so poor in both audio and video quality, this is saying nothing about the music or musician, just the poor recordings on offer.. LANG LANG blows the doors off the studio with this recording. His playing is magical, he lives up too his reputation as a world class artist and the video arts burn the house down with the most amazing lights and camera arts, all too the highest standard.  This DVD would be worth twice the asking price just for the video work alone... a must have MUST BUY DVD and it will leave other recording artists wishing they had come up with something like this..

B0059XTU1S|5.0|Our family (Age 7 to 55) loves the LOTR movies and has been looking forward to this movie for a few years.  After reading the reviews we were wondering whether to go see it or wait for it on DVD, but finally gave in and watched it Christmas Eve.  I really don't understand the bad reviews, we all loved it.  Where was the lack of action, it had plenty, along with great character development, bringing back old favorites and tying the story into LOTR and give us the pleasure of seeing Middle Earth once again.  Our only complaint is we have to wait another year to see part 2 and then another 7 months to finish out the story.  It is not as epic as LOTR because it is a different story and we have only seen the first of 3 movies.  Go see it and have fun knowing this sets up LOTR and may be our final journey to Middle Earth.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I knew Colleen could rip out my heart, but I wasn't ready for this. I couldn't put it down, but I've been sick to my stomach for 2 days. It's real, it's tough, and it isn't pretty. But,there is a truth and a bitter sweetness in Sky's smiles, and in Dean's heartbreak. I want it out of my head, but as a survivor, I'm glad to see it on paper in all it's gritty angst. I will read anything Colleen Hoover writes.

0062215507|5.0|This book comes with many illustrations from the movie as well as full-color glossy pages. It looks like a really big magazine with zero advertisements.<br />There are many surprise pull-out items, like your own copy of Harry's invitation letter to Hogwarts and tickets to the Yule Ball.  This is filled with things that will<br />make a Potter fan delighted. I was so surprised by the high quality of this book relative to the price.  I would definitely buy this again!
B008JAG2AA|5.0|So funny. I'm not a comedy movie person but I love the american pie movies and this was just as good if not better.
B004EKCNMA|2.0|I didnt really care for the animation syle in this movie. I feel like I just spent the last two hours on a cartoon camera flying through the air.<br />Jim Careys voice acting was sub par as well.

B0090EJ99A|4.0|I recommend this movie for anyone lookin for something funny to watch, it's not as offensive as Borat or Bruno. It's more like The Hangover with jokes you haven't seen or heard yet

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|You will definitely like this movie, it's pretty much the same thing but with live big-budget actors. Funny all the way through.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|The movie came quickly, and was an amazing price because of the lightning deal. It came quickly, and I have every reason to be satisfied.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Speaking of the overall story I really liked this book.  The author managed to put a lot of realism in a very unrealistic story.  It would be hard for me to give a book about zombies 5 stars compared to the other books I've read,  The thing is, I sometimes forgot that was I was reading was about zombies.  For me that's what made the book so good.  You can almost imagine the story being about any war. I understand why the author chose the writing style, but i couldn't help but want more from some of the stories.  Some of them would make good books on their own.  You only get part of the story from several people in many different parts of the world.  It will be interesting to see how the movie tells the story.  I'm only giving it 4 stars simply because it's about zombies, and I'm not 100% sold on the writing style.

0545403359|4.0|This stunning book is so affecting, deeply moving and which touches your heart with such thought-provoking guilelessness that you will find it hard not to connect with this epic tale. From master storyteller, Michael Morpurgo, here is another spectacular story that stands-out from all the rest by the strength of narrative and truth-drawing clarity. Unlike many accounts of World War one this story is about one particular horse's experience, which adds emphasis to not just the loss of human life but the thousands of horses that carried the soldiers into battle. Set in 1914, this tale is about Joey, a young farm horse who is thrust into the midst of the war on the Western Front. With his officer, he charges towards the enemy, witnessing the horror of the frontline. But even in the desolation of the trenches, Joey's courage touches the soldiers around him; for this one horse is truly remarkable.<br /><br />Uniquely distinctive this spectacular book presents to the reader the story of the horses that played such a vital role within WW1, as compared to the human accounts - as seen through the eyes of a horse. Observation rather than speech is the backbone for this compelling tale, of love and loss, sacrifice and inhumane acts that go against nature itself. This is a story that is targeted for a wide readership, including both the younger reader and older, as the reader is able to identify with the realistic storyline and connect with Joey's experiences and thoughts personally.<br /><br />Recently having been made into a film adaptation for the big screen, War Horse is a book with such a clear, simple message and that is to give the reader an insight into the horses of the First World War as well as the history in general. Atmospheric and full of such detailed descriptions that ignite all senses, so that you can visualize clearly what it would have been like in the trenches- the putrid smell of death, the mud, the fumes, the congealed blood upon tattered, lice-infested linen. There were thousands upon thousands of horses taken to the front line during the war and less than a quarter of them ever returned home, for many were killed in battle, died of starvation or used as food for the men. The war was not kind to the horse and as the sole means of transportation at the time, they were indispensable to the soldiers, for companionship as much as anything else. As a children's book naturally the graphic, explicit parts are dampened down slightly, for it is the experiences that Joey encounters and his personal story that is ultimately the important part of this book.<br /><br />A book that tugs on the heartstrings of human emotion and which was certainly nostalgic as I connected with the story (having had both my Great Grandparents in WW1, where sadly my Great Grandfather died in the Somme, going `over the top'). It is also a story that will appeal to those who hold horses in high regard and understand the strong bond between a horse and his rider; hence this is also an element that I found most significant within the story. Just stunningly beautiful and affecting, I would highly recommend this *warning, you may need a tissue!*en.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|But I think it could've lasted longer. It kind of left you at a cliff, but all in all, it's a good book.
B007G51UV0|4.0|Pros: No fuss installation, worked the first time round. Everything is clearly marked. Easy to overclock. The Asus smart fan aqpplication is awesome. Wi-fi works well.<br /><br />Cons: No IEEE 1394 firewire. Poor backward compatibility - no IDE connector. Hence, a separate PCI card or Sata/Pata adaptor will be required to connect older IDE hardisks and optical drives. If not for these issues, I would have given it a full 5-star rating.
1451673442|3.0|I just haven't been able to get into the Magic,  so I really can't give it a fair rating. I love the Secret so hopefully I'll be able to give it some more time.
0553801473|5.0|For me this has been the best out of the 5 books, specially considering the slow pase of the fourth one.The only problem I have is having to wait for the nex one!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I got this app for my 3 yo son but I think I play it more than he does.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|This movie is poorly written, acting is only so-so.  My wife was wanting to see this badly and she fell asleep 1/2 way through.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Instruction video is online, just make sure you test the case after you put it on.  So far it is working ok.  Make sure you clean your phone really well.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I use this little gadget to transfer photos from my camera to my ipad or computre. It is much easier and faster than trying to hook the camera to a computing environment. No cables, no softwares, no compatibility issues !!! Very cheap and convenient.

B008QMMEOE|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game for kids.  My 3 year old enjoys it and it keeps him entertained and occupied for long periods of time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Far-fetched and over-long. The author keeps piling on new plot tricks, unlikely revelations and, of course, sex scenes. No character in this book is believable.
B008NMT684|4.0|Fun game for the kids.  My 3 year old enjoys it and has fun playing it.  It is a rather simple puzzle game but it keeps him entertained and occupied.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I just received my new Kindle HD 8.9 Fire today.  I was excited to get the Facebook app installed only to find some very bad reviews regarding the News Feed issues and usability of the app in general.  I thought I would go ahead and try it, and sure enough, it does not update the news feed past a couple pages of posts. Because of this issue, it is not usable in my opinion.  Guess I will have to access it through the web browser as was suggested in another review or continue to use it on my laptop and iphone.  Hope it is resolved soon because this is one of the main apps I wanted to use!
B002N1AEMS|1.0|I ordered this record on vinyl, and it came to me in a ripped up sleeve. I pulled the record out, and the vinyl had been warped into waves. I am very displeased with this product, and I will never buy from this provider again.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great Movie...good message. The language was a little strong, but old Clint Eastwood tends to cuss like an old man, so.....
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|Great Characters some you'll love, some you'll hate and some you'll want to kill. A must see movie with twists and turns to the end.
B008BR3Q0U|4.0|Great 2 lp set from the black crowes frontman. great songs i imagine, but this set plays at 45 rpm, and my high end project turntable only plays 33 and a third. Amazon should list this because many high end turntables do not play the faster speeds. looks great though, now if i could only play it............
B005LAIHSG|3.0|The previews of this movie were good, or should I say the best part of the movie.  Glad I didn't spend much on this.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|A great resource explaining the source of introvert/extrovert personalities and how to maximize your potential and stay true to yourself.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|One of the best mysteries written and the best of Agatha Christie!! Read it and see for yourself right now.
0545265355|5.0|I've read all three of these books and I loved them, so I wanted to own them. I put this book set on my wishlist and didn't even realize how nice it was. It is a beautifully designed hardcover set with sleeves on each book, but if you remove the sleeve you will see a beautiful foil mockingjay on the front of each book. LOVE the set!
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love this CD; the singers are terrific. The men are truly professional and have the most wonderful voices. Viva Il Divo!!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|This movie will make any adult laugh. From the opening to the end, it doesn't stop. If you like family guy, you'll love this humor.
B00005JM02|5.0|Brand New Movie.  I am glad I realized what REGION to ORDER it FROM.  Make sure you order the movie from the correction REGION or it will not work in certain DVD players.  THERE is a DIFFERENCE and this SELLER made that VERY CLEAR in the Description.  Thank You!!!
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Basic plot. A dancing penguin who can't sing is outcast from his tribe who won't dance.  Picks up a posse of penguins from \\"south of the border\\" who love all his dance moves hoping to score with the Chicas. Got that?  Great music, great tap dancing, a quest for survival and a love story. Great movie, perfect blue ray for showing off picture and sound system. Can't recommend enough for the entire family.
B00AG4NSY0|3.0|The first was fun and fresh, the second a little less so. Now this one continues the downward trend, as too many of these tracks sound like they could have came from any other Christmas disc. The choice of songs is actually a decent mix, but none really stand out. Slightly above average are the big and somewhat jazzy `White Christmas'; and `Jingle Bell Rock' is enthusiastic, but not particularly memorable.  Not sure how it plays on TV, but if they can't keep up for Christmas, I'm wondering if the whole Glee thing has already begun to fade.
630469654X|5.0|This movie was never given the praise that it should have had. It is absolutely awesome having intrigue, mystery, magic, romance, adventure, action, and the best music and cast for the period of time.  It makes you laugh, cry, jump, be surprised and so happy!  I also saw the making of Ladyhawke the very next day and was even more impresses with the actors and the filming.
B007SGM084|5.0|The author is amazing and has you completely engulfed in the story the whole time.  Everything about this book is perfect!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I like this game.  You do have to think a little but it does get a little repetitive.  Android version appears to lack some of the graphic eye candy of other OS versions--based on what I saw on youtube.  I think it is very fair that developers allow you the options to earn or purchase upgrades without penalty either way. One annoyance is the tool tips pop in center of screen and you cannot move or turn them off. Decent,  cerebral time killer. These comments are based on the Samsung Galaxy S3 Jelly Bean and I had no issues downloading,  installing,  or force closing.  25 DEC 2012.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books. Recommend this book for anyone to read. Can't wait for the next one. Great Book
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it.  Cannot wait for the next one. The difficulty went up and so did the birds.  Liked to have a part of the screen to remind what each does but I can figure it out as I go.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|We enjoyed this movie, had lots of chuckles and thought it was worth the price. We might not have your same taste, so each person will have to judge for themselves.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well done.  Can't seem to get enough.  I watched the entire first season in like 2 days.  Lots of twists and turns and the characters well defined.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is a great game. Gets kids away from the video games that many parents use for a baby sitter. Of course you have to actually spend time with your child and play the game with them or have enough kids in the house to do so. Its a great family experience though. Take advantage of the time spent with your children & enjoy!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|very hard to play games with rapid need for movement and command keys like mass effect were you ned to move and use powers
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Great add on to the legos so your child has the opportunity to grow his or her imagination. They can build for hours.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|PRETTY GOOD! I kinda liked it. I THINK IT WAS TOO SHORT Because it was super weird how it was short
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan writes another masterpiece! This was a great story all the way through the book. Can't wait for The House Of Hades!
0307887448|4.0|This book reads like a SF Juvenile in the world of Reamde/Snowcrash. It's unclear whether the writer intentionally adopted that \\"voice\\" but it's there. Consequently, I really did not want to like this book but I did despite my biases. First of all, the author has done a very nice job of weaving together many of the  trivia of the 1980's that those (of us) who were excited by the emergence of computation outside the classroom/work will recall while following the storyline. Second, he's captured many of the cheesy lines/sentiments that those (of us) who lived that decade as teenagers or young adults undoubtedly uttered or thought. Third, he's somehow managed to create an entertaining technological dystopian on-the-way-to-Mad-Max world without invoking hipper-than-thou irony to keep his distance from the clichés that fill this novel. Most of all: Great title.<br /><br />I would reserve this book (print edition to keep with the 80's theme) for your Summer reading. Worth it.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This is a great read for those of you who seek an introductory guide to financial independence.  The best FIRST investment I've ever made.  Invest in financial knowledge.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was one of the more interesting \\"waking up married -- make the marriage work\\" stories I've read in a while. I won't repeat the synopsis of the book as others have done it most ably;the plot is unrealistic and yet the author manages to make it work. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because the first half was very slow; I almost gave up on it. I'm glad I didn't! This was not a bad way to spend a couple of hours and as it is free, you can't beat the price.
B001P3SA94|5.0|i thought this movie told alot about the early record recording industry,also about some great recording artists and there strugggles in the industry and in life!!!!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This was a christmas present for my mother in law and it is now one of her favorite CDs.  I was glad to find it at such a great price!
B000002ADT|5.0|Gave this CD to my young adult son to expose him to the ever fresh, ever wondrous, Kind of Blue. Wonderful recording. I never tire of this music.
B001NHNG64|2.0|very disappointed.  The killing floor was much better.  Jack Reacher almost seemed like a secondary character in this book.  Sometimes there was too much detail and not enough action (like a sniper bullet's course takes about three paragraphs to describe).  I'll give number three a try and see if I keep reading or not (hopefully the characters will quit &#34;shrugging&#34; constantly).
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was another great Harry Bosch mystery by Michael Connelly that brings to life the LA riots and a story of unknown aftermath.

Her recipes are easy to follow and her commentary usually makes me laugh out-loud.<br /><br />I have had this book for several weeks now. Already a couple of recipes have become &#34;go-to&#34; ones. You have to try her &#34;Wild Rice Gratin with Kale and Swiss Cheese.&#34; I don't know that I will ever get tired of making it. A completely company worthy meal that is hearty enough for a main dish but also makes a great side.<br /><br />Thank you Deb!

B0094K1K42|5.0|great movie... sort of a dramedy, a little dark but funny. it is a humorous look at how life can turn out, even if you were the prettiest girl in the school. i'm in love with charlize theron, overall great acting from her. Down to earth plot with not too much hollywood smoke. overall a funny and light watch.

B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|I like the idea of this movie. Entrepreneurial young bucks in a twisted relationship with a stupid girl. One guys doing his civic duties with ill-gotten gains and the other just wants more. I actually like Benicio in this movie. Travolta is wasted. Blake Lively offers nothing but something for the boys to fight over. I can't even stand the sound of her voice narrating the film. Salma Hayek looks weak as a female kingpin. I don't like the way her character is written. It offers no real twist in her development.<br />I'm glad I saw it but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|WITH CHRISTMAS HERE AGAIN, HAD TO HAVE IT.<br />AND NOW IN BLU-RAY.<br />WE CAN PLAY IT AGAIN & AGAIN.<br /><br />THANKS!!

B007K3JFUQ|2.0|I loved the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock, and I had high hopes for this.<br /><br />Alas, no luck.<br /><br />I knew something was wrong when the best character--Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams)--was killed right off the bat.<br /><br />And it just got worse from there.<br /><br />The villain, Moriarty, is simply dull.  He may do bad things, but he is so remote from them and so professorially boring, that it's hard to work up any hatred.  He is like everyone's blandest, chalky teacher: eminently forgettable.<br /><br />Watson (Jude Law) has a stronger part, but it's all wasted on weak jokes about Sherlock's competition with Watson's new wife.  The bromance is telegraphed in every scene and overdone.<br /><br />Some of the better characters--Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly), Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), the gypsy Sim (Noomi Rapace)--either scarcely appear or have nothing useful to do with the plot.  Even Sherlock's brother (Stephen Frye) can't make anything of his pointless role.<br /><br />The problem is the writing.  The plot is opaque and dull.  The dialogue wavers from pedestrian and unmemorable to stilted and unfunny.<br /><br />Even Robert Downey, Jr.--one of the best actors in the world--can't make anything of his part, and doesn't really act.  He is reduced to merely striking poses.<br /><br />An utter waste of wonderful people on a bland, frantic, unexciting mess.<br /><br />Too bad.

0307594165|5.0|This novel is a jewel.  Anyone familiar with Morrison's work knows what to expect.  I couldn't put it down.  The short length made that easy to do.  Perhaps it was meant to be read in one sitting.

B004ZZFMTK|5.0|this revolutionary cookbook was published in 1961 in two parts. this is the first part. julia child sngle-handedly changed the face of cooking in this country! before she attended the famous french cordon bleu academy in the late 1940's she could barely boil an egg. when she attended the academy it was a male dominated world. she changed all that. it took her most of the decade of the 1950's to write and test the recipes for her large two part cookbook. the first publisher she submitted to rejected it as not economically feasible to publish. her second try was successful and the rest is history. this two-part cookbook is still in print more than 50 years after it was published! it has sold millions of copies. if you want lo learn how to cook from the master this is the book for you! bon appetit! aloha haleiwa jon

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fell in love with Tina Fey after this book! It reinforced all of my opinions of her (smart, funny, strong) and had a great element of female-power without being overbearing due to the hilarious self-deprecation and anecdotes. Thank you, Tina for a great great read!

B008K7CVI4|4.0|I have 3 grandsons who all love Lego's. These products take a beating and are made well. This set has lots of extra pieces and teaches the kids about all the aspects of a Fireman. Educational and great for inproving manual dexterity.

B003PIUC02|5.0|Great movie with great acting, it is a must see. Be prepared for all and anything as they live nothing untold.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I love the user interface on this app. Based on the interface it is a 5 plus.<br />The problem is with the radar maps.  It will be pouring rain yet the map shows no rain in the area. Weather.com has more accurate radar maps which I don't understand since I would think the all come from the same source. Improve the maps and this is a winner.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's ok. I got upset and deleted it because it deleted all my progress. It takes so o long to get anywhere in this game.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|I give it 4 stars for the way it looked, amazing! truly enjoyed that. acting is good too. I think they could have given it a little more story/substance instead of many battle scenes.<br />but overall, I enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I loved this book! I only put it down when I couldn't keep my eyes open any more. I love the interactions between all the main characters and I only wish there was more to read about them.  Simply amazing. I know this isn't a good review but really, you should just buy the book and read it. You won't be disappointed.
B002VGFZII|5.0|I loved the story, the action, the special effects. This is someting that makes me hunger for any and all sequels.

B006362ZR6|5.0|Almost all songs are tops. Follow ups are promising. All my friends seem to agree with me. So faar so good
0156030306|5.0|I gave the book as a gift (I have not read it) to my son and he loved it. He had actually read the book years ago and loved it so much he wanted his own copy to read again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My wife is addicted to this game. It is exactly as advertised and she is very happy with it. Thanks
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Movie is great arrived on time and in fantastic shape and it came at such a great deal for Black Friday
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a good game, but shouldn't have to pay for coins to play. This is supposed to be a free game!
B009ETEEAU|2.0|Received this as a Christmas present to be used on a ski trip.  Here's what I found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Widescreen recordings and photos<br />-Good quality video<br />-LCD screen<br />-Full accessories for helmet and bike mounting<br />-Nice waterproof holder<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Regular lens (as opposed to fisheye lens on GoPro) - makes it much harder to constantly capture fast moving 'targets' like a 10-year old boy on snow skis<br />-POOR helmet mount:<br />  -no vertical adjustment (up and down), only left-to-right and side-to-side<br />  -very hard to get camera to be completely steady, there's always some play left in the mount no matter how hard I tightened down all of the set screws<br />-Battery life seemed very short.  Charged all night each night, and when first turned on at the first slope, showed only two of three bars of charge.<br />-Frequently gave message that the SD card was bad and requested that I reformat it (with videos already stored on the card!) Took many tries of taking the card out and reinserting, powering off, etc., to get it to work.<br />-Locked up (froze) at some point each day of the 4 day trip, so that the \\"Busy\\" light would stay illuminated until the camera ran out of battery power.  On last day, it froze with the LCD screen still on, and once it ran out of power, it never came back on, even after fully charging.  Suspect problem has something to do with the power button - may have just gotten a lemon.<br /><br />We'll be returning and requesting a refund, not replacement, as it doesn't fit our needs, although it might be just right, especially for the price, in other uses.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This is so true to life!  Great job of acting by Streep and Jones.  It's simple and to the point.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A very well written story that follows up on the next generation.  For some reason it is not as riveting as the first installment....but that could just be me.  I have almost finished the 900+ pages and cant wait for the third and final tomb.
0897502027|5.0|Book arrived quickly.  It's by the Master Bruce Lee so how can it not be great.  Pretty much his lives thoughts on his studies in many kinds of fighting.  Not all his own but things he picked up from his studies from others.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is his best one yet. I hope he makes more. This is a master piece of work I hope he makes more books like this.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|This is a chick flick and I didn't think a very good one.  I can usually tolerate chick flicks but this one was hard.  Entertainment was not there for me.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|i do not know what everybody is talking about the song that they say is missing is there the other people must be on stupid pills
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is very addicting. I find myself going back to it. my three year old also loves using this game. must have.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only displays first ten posts and then just blue boxes. Works great on my droid phone and iPad but not on my kindle fire.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|No issues with it at all. It works, it's quick and as long as your Android device allows you to enlarge the screen so you can see small print and little check boxes, it's a perfectly useful app.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Kind of slow and predictable after characters introduced. Had it figured out early in the storyline. Previous books in the series held my attention more.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have heard nothing but raves about this game and would willingly pay for it! Imagine how happy I was to find it for free this morning!! Its so inventive and fun download it now!
B00170DEM8|4.0|A great holiday classic! Too bad I streamed it on Amazon Prime and it was so slow to load it stopped constantly.<br />If i hadn't paid for it I would have turned it off! But movie itself is good.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|My godson loved the Christmas present<br />I recommend, good buy.<br />As the child has to ride, helps develop the child's mind.<br />When that parents do not have held that riding for children<br />Delivery was fast and arrived ahead of schedule.
B004GCK6XY|5.0|Good to have this handy. Helps her to change to positive mood. We had the DVD. liked the Blu-ray quality and specially sound.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book had a good plot, but I found it difficult to read due to the way it was written. It was written like a child wrote it, so that was different and confusing at times.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Great SciFi and wrap up on the Firefly series. Love Nathan in this series, and also in Castle. See Firefly episodes 1-14 before watching Serenity.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis Maddoxx is the hottest BAD BOY that you'll ever meet! This book is just so amazing that mere words can't seem to describe it!! JUST BUY THE BOOK!!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|so many tunes, loving it. super addictive and great for this time of year. feel like I'm learning too. definite great product
B004YAS9M8|5.0|Love this album! I heard a track on the radio and had to get the album. Outstanding musician and composer.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Nice watch, not so big. Style and finish looks great, and matches with the band. Little difficulty with setting day and date, but finally set.<br />4_17_13<br />I have been using this watch for over five months.  It does not keep good time! It is running three min fast in 10 days. I would not recommend it for purchase. I am down grading the rating to just two stars!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use Weather Channel a lot on my I-Phone and this is similar and so was easy for me to learn.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|It kind of started out silly! The story is not so great but the effects are what made this movie okay
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is the best show, crime drama of all. Season 10 has the same imaginative writing that made this show a fan favorite from the start.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I liked it a lot it is a classic! Highly recommend this movie. Great love story and history is also included
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love vampire books and this one remains my favorite one so far.  It was very well written and it keeps you interested through every chapter.
B006WXHJNU|4.0|Good movie if you like superheroes! The animation was so cool.  It was an entertaining movie and the Hulk was something else!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Classic Clint Eastwood! Gran Torino without the violence and cussing. He is a heart warming guy underneath that gruff exterior!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I'm a little late jumping on  the Frank Ocean train, but I'm glad i did. I can just sit and listen to this all day!
B000MR1V22|5.0|I love this movie!!! very touching, funny, and simply awesome! One of my favorite movies with Steve Carell.... He did great!
B00003OSTR|5.0|great movie to add to my collection . a reak hero and from tennessee where i live. don't make movies like this anymore
0525478817|5.0|My daughter has read and highly recommended this book.  I am looking forward to readhing it.  It was much less expensive than at the book store
B0000CGD0S|5.0|glad to have the dvd.  had it on vhs and watched every year.  glad to add the dvd version to my collection
B0053O89IS|5.0|Very well received by my daughter.  I found the price of this excellent as compared to in the stores.  I'm sure that a Bones marathon will be watched!
B009JBZH54|1.0|Had not seen Dark Knight Rises yet... Received the Trilogy as a Christmas gift. Two Dark Knight Rises Special Features discs, no movie disc. Now they are saying it will take 2-4 weeks to get a replacement. Needless to say, not too happy about this. Somebody at Warner Brothers needs to put a foot in someone's backside.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I couldn't finish it because Amazon turned the movie off during play!<br /><br />I paid 5 bucks to watch this then I fell asleep, the next day I turn it back on and while I was finishing the last half hour Amazon decides to cut it off on me because it reached its 24 expiration!<br /><br />Amazon, how about letting an individual finish playing during its playtime? or extend the 24 hour by a couple hours to be perhaps generous to those who are trying to finish?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|With all the different feeds and chat available, this app is just as good as the iPad app and almost as fully featured as the website.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I speak Spanish or else I would write more.  Only 10 more words left.  Holler...city of squalor.  I wanna smack you.  WTH.
B005XZHQKY|3.0|I think this product is a bit overrated for the price. I was expecting lot more than what I got.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I continue to be amazed and drawn to Patrick Rothfuss' writing style.  His words paint a most wonderful and detailed picture of a story well told.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Horrible toy.  Poorly designed. The blocks do not stay stacked as others have said.  Curved and tapered edges result in the blocks sliding off each other when trying to stack.  Our 5 yr old cried in frustration after receiving this on Christmas Eve.<br />The box logo Is not the real Mattel logo and you can not find this Space version of the game on Mattel's websit so we agree with others likely an imitation. We will try the original version as recommended by others.<br />We are extremely disappointed in Amazon as we bought this during their holiday lightening deal and you would think they would at least offer legit stuff on their deals.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The world needed a show like this.  Incredible actors, fantastic old school (&#34;real&#34;) special effects, amazing and talented writer/creator, producer, director, show runner, etc.  Based off a superb comic book series but with a different, yet equally as incredible, script.  It's not just a show about zombies.  It's so much more.....watch it & we'll talk.
B002BVYBC4|4.0|Movie starts off great, but for a car movie slows down a bit in the middle and at the end. But still some good action.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you have yet to watch this show, you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything you *think* you know about it, isn't true at all.  The only way to experience the brilliance is to watch it from the very start.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|The beginning and the first part were confusing to me. To be inside the head of Marilyn Manson and his dreams, hopes adventures and emotions proves to be very influential in a very weird way. His struggles though completely different from the everyday person seemed to have answers to everyday life and also kept me asking more questions then answering. By the end of the book I had more of a understanding of this man but I don't understand him at all. He wrote a  very good book for open minded people.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I love British movies.  I love Sci-Fi style Alien movies.  I love bad ass little Brits who don't take any s***.  I love to laugh and jump from being startled at the same time.  I also love glow in the dark teeth.  That being said, this movie was a PERFECT fit for me.  I can't get enough!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is kind of annoying in the fact that it's like most social games. I still find it fun and entertaining though because you don't have to wait all day for energy to return. There is still waiting of course but you are still able to do stuff while waiting. All in all I give it a 5 out of 5.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The plot and characters have been adequately covered in the other reviews. I personally begin to lose respect for a film when, even suspending judgement on the feasability factor, the characters' survivability  far, far exceeds the possible and goes into the Marvel Comics realm. Some watchers might find the tongue in cheek  aspects of the Norris and Schwarzenegger characters amusing, but I didn't.  And from the beginning  it seemed like the Expendables were stabbing and shooting mannequins. Are hardened mercenaries really so helpless?  I found this sequel more silly than entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|so far so good. just on 8 th of the season. They better not kill off Daryll I will be hot if they do.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Nice story about the campus and Jack Ryan Jr.  Also has a good backstory on John Clark and how he deals with retirement.
B00APUQRPC|1.0|was so slow I fell asleep 3x the plot was predectable as was the romantic pairing. save ur money and your time.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I gave it five stars because I've never read any book quite like it.  The author doesn't fill pages with the same thing over and over. If you are interested in reading the book because the movie is now out, don't be surprised if you start reading and you wonder if it is the book that the movie is based on.  Part one is all the background and you don't get to life at sea until part two.  The images that the book inspires are great and the end is interesting and different than I expected.
B00003CXRM|5.0|A delight and entertaining. I think I've send what I feel and that should be quite enough. Sorry about the sixteen words.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#34;Seriously this book is amazing! I never thought a book could come close to the spot I have in my heart for Molly McAdams's &#34;Taking Chances&#34; but this book comes very close. It's a totally different story, not to be compared to, but it is just as special to me &#60;3<br /><br />Sky & Holder's story is wrought with ups and downs and a strong foundation of love and life's twists... Colleen Hoover wrote an awesome enlightening story and I look forward to reading more books by her :-)<br /><br />5 star book right here peeps!&#34;
B004IRYJC6|2.0|The style of the shoe was right and why I gave them another shot. The issue I had with the 1st pair and this pair was the stitching on the inside. It was poorly done which created rubbing. It would have been a matter of time before a blister would have formed. Abort mission was the result. I return them, got refunded and went with another brand.
157421327X|3.0|This book is ok and has some good ideas but nothing to jump for joy about. My daughter traces them then colors them.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Red witch seems to be a reversal of the first movie. Void of theme. How could she have a daughter that old? Does not flow at all from previous films.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|they r a great tv show that i enjoy watch on a regular bases this way I don't have to bother with netflx
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game would be more fun if you did not have to purchase so many diamonds to go in the other rooms.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Tighter, less wordy and less attempting to be psychological, and more evidence<br />based, so overall a much more engrossing novel
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is a memory book that reads like a novel. It starts with history of how the author first came to be involved with these memory masters, then about halfway through it really gets serious in terms of techniques,<br />This is a truly captivating and well-written survey of everything there is to know about memory.<br />It kind of reminds me of Blink, except for memory. Great book, reads like a novel!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Good Book, I have already purchased the next three in the series, and can not wait to read those too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I NEVER write reviews for the simple fact that Im to lazy to review every single book I read, but this book has moved me to write a review.  I loved the story from start to finish, it was so well written and all tied together beautifully.  Coleen Hoover has a way with words and is truly talented.  I will read ANYTHING this author writes!  I would give this book 10 stars if it were possible..
B0029N92UU|5.0|I should really get someone who speaks French to interpret this album for me, but she has a lovely voice and the whole album is sexy  and romantic sounding.  Just makes for a sophisticated atmosphere....ooh la la!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is probably the best game on my kindle and I quite a few games.  if u r a parent reading this I recommend this for ur child!love it!!!:-)
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I have seen all of the ice age movies and have loved every one of them. This one made me laugh from the start to the end.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I like the time feature and the weather etc, but I cannot get the alarm to work.  When I touch the &#34;i&#34; button, no info comes up.
B00000I0XW|4.0|I like musicals, and if you're getting this you probably already know what it'll sound like. Get it if it's remotely your cup of tea
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Durgens!!!!!!!!!!! absolutely love it. cute and fuzzies all around and easy to to use and just plain fun. a must have for anyone
B00ACFL69C|1.0|Let me start by saying that I will never get the time back that I invested in watching this unbelievable cinematic load of overblown crap. Sorry the French Connection is a classic and I'd be proud to have it in my collection. The was as big and stinky as they would have you believe Gina Gershon's bush was in the opening scene. Emile Hirsch, his performance was very forced and he is unbelievable every time he threatened to beat Thomas Hayden Church's character, ridiculous. The story was as much a waste of paper as it was a waste of celluloid. A degenerate family out witted by the boyfriend of the woman he tricked them into killing. A mentally challenged, sexually abused daughter (Nell meets Texas chain saw massacre' stir in Bangkok Dangerous and add a twist of any Jerry Springer episode of recent memory) and you'll have the movie \\"Killer Joe\\"<br /><br />Crap not a Cult classic, I could have and should have made love to my girlfriend one more time before she left for home that day but instead I watched this and I am truly regretful on all accounts. I would have had more fun, been satisfied and would not have wasted $12 dollars in the process.<br /><br />View this at your own risk, I wish I would have read these reviews before watching this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it. love the winning deal feature. Dont waste time on a non-winning game<br />this is a classic and you will enjoy
0739311123|5.0|Received on time and in good condition. Mitch Albom is my favorite author. He's a great story teller and writes the most interesting books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Unfortunately, I'm not going to say anything new about this book, seeing how about 15 thousand other people have already submitted reviews. What I will do is offer a solution to getting through it: You're gonna have to use your IMAGINATION. I agree with a majority of the negative reviews: this book is the equivalent of a straight-to-DVD, D-list movie. The plot has been done (and done better), the editing is non-exsistant (I didn't believe you could actually self-publish on the Internet, but apparently you can...) and as far as books go, it really is a waste of time. HOWEVER, if you can IMAGINE that it's a good book by ACKNOWLEDGING its many flaws and deciding that, even though it's 50 SHADES of literary nonsense, you're gonna read it anyway, you might end up surprised by how entertaining it is. Just like some of those straight-to-DVD, D-list movies...
B003XU7VY2|5.0|Product was received on time and in great shape. Have A Little Faith by my favorite writer will be listened to after the holidays.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Like angry birds isn't addictive enough, they make a starwars version.  Its pretty clever, funny and well thought out.  Love it.
140132634X|5.0|Received the product on time and in good shape. Looking forward to listening to it after the holidays are over.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The chapters change characters so abruptly sometimes you feel like you missed something. Story will jump into the middle of a situation, then explain backwards, and back to the present. Seems written in a different style than the previous books, takes a little longer to read, but definitely worth it!
0847835073|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it so much he was actually blushing ;) Monica's book in pictures will make a great coffee table book as she is delightful to look at. Just breathtakingly beautiful.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|We paid $5.39 (after taxes) for this movie, and it kept stopping to load. Impossible to watch! I have had this problem with another movie through amazon as well.
034580404X|4.0|I got these on black friday and you cant beat the price! But after I have started reading them they arent the best written books out there and as being someone who loves English it kind of bothers me. But they are enjoyables.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have app. It has many different translations, and several have full audio. I listen every night when I go to bed.
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|This will make my second Intel core I7 cpu.  Runs great and really has improved the smoothness of my games
B00006CXSS|5.0|I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Beyond 5 stars captivating book from beginning to end looking forward to the next few books Suzanne Collins amazing writer
B00004TS0E|5.0|I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I cannot express how much I love this album!  I bought it after listening to Anything Could Happen on repeat for a few weeks.  I was not really a fan of Ellie Goulding until I heard this album.  I liked some of the tracks off of Lights but most of them were just very light pop in my opinion.  Halcyon has a heart and you can feel the pain in the lyrics.  Ellie's voice also helps add to the feeling behind the songs.  Her voice is much like her fashion style in that it's beautiful and feminine yet it also has a hard edge to it.  I love the entire album, beginning to end.  Even the lightest track on the album (in my opinion) \\"I Need Your Love\\" feat. Calvin Harris has some fantastic lyrics.<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about Ellie Goulding in the past, buy this album.  You'll become a fan. ^^

0345803485|5.0|I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did, it was pretty amazing. I have heard a lot of hype about this novel, it was worth the hype it received. I felt very sympathetic to the characters and they felt like they were actually people. Regarding the graphic content, there was a lot of that but I thought that it contributed to the story. Christian was a very sympathetic character, strangely I felt myself rooting for him and Anatashia to make it work. I am not usually the one that rate books five stars but this book deserved it. I love how the lively characters came together. In addition, the writing style was very unique and I easily followed the story.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the trilogy.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|So, I had to find out what all the fuss was about...I did not know what I was getting myself into.  I enjoyed this story.  At first I didn't want anyone to know I was reading it but as more of my friends began reading it, I could not stop talking about it.  It's been months since I read this story and I STILL talk/think about it!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|By the time I started this book, the shock factor of the trilogy had wore off.  This was my least liked of the trilogy, but I am glad I read it.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book started out great, got a little lack luster in the middle and ended with a bang.  It was well worth the read!

B00006AFF5|5.0|Love this movie!!  Always a favorite!  Makes one laugh and cry!  So good for any age and it will be sure to be a favorite!
B008KE3960|4.0|This was fun but you really have to pay attention even if you set paths. It was a change from standard tower defense.
B000YHG72E|5.0|A great holiday movie with alot of good laughs. This movie seems to have gained momentum as a holiday classic over the recent years. Definately worth a holiday viewing!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I LOVE this album. I was leery at first as albums based solely on a linear story line can be confusing if you don't know the material. However, when I first listened to the album's first three songs; Caravan, BUB2, and the title track Clockwork Angels, I was intrigued. The richness of the music is just as I would expect from a veteran group of highly talented musicians. Lyrics are thought provoking and entertaining. The rest of the album does not disappoint. I think my favorite song is Clockwork Angels. Lyrically, Wish Them Well and The Garden are great. I have this entire album on my playlist.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A holiday movie recently added to the 'classic' list. Not the funniest of all the National Lampoon's 'Vacation' series, but good for a few good laughs.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I enjoyed this Movie though it was a bit slow in parts.  but Clint was his usual self.  I always enjoy his films.
B00000G3PA|5.0|We got our DVD very quickly and buying online was the only way I could find this one! So excited to have it in our collection now!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great fiction book, I would recommend it to anyone.  Great fiction book, I would recommend it to anyone.  Great fiction book, I would recommend it to anyone.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Excellent reproduction of an amazing Anthology! The movies are crystal clear and the sound is superb. I wish all the interviews and bonus material were also 1080P...
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very disappointed.  The town and people are no different than many other books written.  Everything about this story was old news and boring.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase! This case is extremely lightweight and has plenty of room even for larger video cards. I highly recommend this product over the more expensive competition. It has a very high quality feel to it! Most of your cables can tuck away between the right sliding door and the frame, out of sight and out of mind.
0316227706|4.0|Gave this to my niece for Christmas.  she seemed to enjoy it.  would recommend this book to other dog lovers.
1878424319|3.0|After hearing so many rave reviews about this book, I decided to buy it. It is so over-rated. It isn't eloquent and it doesn't have a flow. It is a collection of great tips and insight, though. Don't expect to be captivated by Ruiz' writing. It won't happen. You can expect to pick up some gems along the way. Quick read with no rhythm.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|The only problem is when you replace the original cast it loses it`s basis. Not to mention what happened to the original girl. She should have been in it or at least showed a breakup. Otherwise a great film. Can you imagine Spock or bones being replaced? How about all those robots on Lost In Space and Star Wars being replaced? Or the princess being substituted for a sleep around slut?
1595141979|5.0|HOLY COW. I was completely blown away by this book.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss by Richelle Mead is the third in the Vampire Academy novels. Rose and her friends are still reeling from the attack on their lives by a team of Strigoi. Lissa continues to cultivate her new powers and impresses the Moroi princess. Rose continues to struggle with her feelings for Dimitri. Adrian continues to pursue Rose, but shares a power with Lissa, which makes Christian overwhelmingly jealous. And Rose... sees a ghost? Secrets pile on secrets, and Rose seems to burst with anger and rage at the most inopportune moments. But it seems like everything ends up being connected and leads to a pulse pounding and heart wrenching ending.<br /><br />Very rarely do series just get better and better with each book. Frostbite was twice as good as Vampire Academy. I would say that Shadow Kiss is my current favorite. It's rare these days that I get so invested in a series that I just have to keep going no matter what. As soon as I was done with Shadow Kiss, I immediately bought the next in the series. Harry Potter comes to mind as the only other series that really builds upon itself and gets better and better. The character development, the plot twists, everything comes together perfectly. I am continually impressed by Richelle Mead. She undoubtedly deserves all her success.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful, thrilling follow up to the terrific Frostbite. I know I won't be able to put this series down until the end.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|my kids both love this movie. for a 3year old and a six year old to love it , that says a lot.
1609611543|5.0|This book is great they way it is written! It explains very clearly why wheat is very bad for us and makes us fat !<br /><br />It also explains some of the other very bad effects wheat has on our bodies and minds.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|If you have not bought this movie yet, shame on you. Everyone who made or starred in this movie deserves to get rich off it. I don't see how anyone could ever top what Christopher Nolan has done with the 3 most recent Batman live action movies. These movies make you feel things & look at life in a different way. These are not just movies. They are works of art. I absolutely love the Dark Knight trilogy. It completely beats my previous favorite trilogy, The Matrix trilogy, big time.
B000T433CO|4.0|I liked the concept the house exchange; it made me wonder if that is still practiced. It's light entertainment and a fun way to pass a couple of hours. The little girls are absolutely adorable as was their British accents.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Got this for my 2 year old and he absolutely loves it. He specifically asks me for his Horton elephant movie whenever he wants to watch tv or whenever I turn any other cartoon/movie on for him. I am not sure why he loves it so much but he does and I dont mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good book. I love the author as well. Very interesting and has a lot of action and stuff
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is now the third John Green novel I have read, and it was utterly breathtaking. This is the first book that made me cry since the first grade, when that sort of thing was more or less socially acceptable. Reading the story of a group of very philosophical and very ill kids my age made me put my comparatively unimpressive problems into perspective, and I really think that reading The Fault in Our Stars gave me a new appreciation for life. At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book, as I normally don't read sad books, but in the end I enjoyed it immensely. I am so, so glad I read this book.
1400069289|3.0|This is a well-written and entertaining read. The first section offers a lot of insight, and if the entire book were along the same lines, it would be worthy of 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the second two sections (i.e., 2/3 of the book) do not really fit well within the theme of the book. It is almost as if the author ran out of material and felt pressured to fit the &#34;habit&#34; idea into a fairly routine survey of corporate and organizational practices. There may be some similarities, but I just wasn't buying it as an overarching, coherent theme, and it ended up being a muddled group of breezy stories without in-depth analysis. And to a large extent, the stories were ones I, and certainly others, had heard elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall, I do not regret reading this book, but I got it from the library. Had I paid for it, I'd have felt ripped off. The bottom line is that I was disappointed that the author, who certainly knows his material and is a good writer, seemed to have given up 1/3 of the way through.
B000CRQX34|5.0|I actually received an error message telling me this didn't exist but it still came up !<br /><br />MONTY PYTHON and THE HOLY GRAIL 3-Disk Set<br />I can't recommend this classic enough. But first, let me say this, many people don't seem to care much for their sometimes very dry humor. I don't know if it's because they just dislike the British or their style of Humor, or because they are a different kind of people.  There are many Americans who love their humor and get it !.<br />Their humor can be wry, dry, and bizarre at times, but that's the Britt's !  As for Monty Python Comedy, if you're in a need of cheering up, something to brighten your day or night or just looking for something really hilariously funny, or to up-scale your funny meter, then I recommend a Monty Python Movie, because you can't go wrong. They will have you rolling on the floor laughing your fourth-point of contact ( military speak for your Butt ! ) off !<br />These guys have been around for years and in their own country, they can pack em into any auditorium with standing room only.<br />If you do decide to purchase this movie, I also highly recommend that you keep your remote control in your hand or very close by.  You may find the need to back up a little and then to pause, just so you can read one of their outrageously funny jokes, side notes, or even something irreverent that might appear where you least expect it to.  As I said, these guys are VERY !  Outrageously  F-U-N-N-Y !  and you don't want to miss anything.  I know it can sort of screw up the continuity of the movie but unless you have eagle-like vision and can read really fast, keep the remote handy.<br />For Great Comedy and Up Lifting Out of This World Humor, Monty Python is the way to go ! ..... And don't forget your Spamalot !
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander wrote some truly touching words. It would be terribly difficult as an MD to share what he did since so many MD's have no idea of our direct connection to All That Is. Good job Dr. Alexander!  Thank you for your efforts.
B000OZ28IS|5.0|I am halfway through Restless and as always, the book is so much better than a movie or TV show.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Starts off slooooow.  And the acting in the first half isn't great either, but the second act brings it home and pulls the rating from two stars to three.  Its worth the money.  Good family picture, some profanity, no nudity.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A brain surgeon collapses from a rare illness, goes into coma and is pronounced brain dead yet finds himself alive and completely congnizant on &#34;the other side&#34;.  His journey to the next world and back reads better than the best fiction; I literally could not put it down.  I had seen Eben Alexander's story on the TV series &#34;Beyond and Back&#34; and was thrilled when I heard he'd written a book about it.  That book turned out to be well-written and detailed, laying to rest the medical establishment's denial about the reality of near-death as a true account of continuing consciousness and not a fake euphoria driven by excess serotonin.  Dr. Alexander brings back confirmation that love is the causal center and meaning of life and that consciousness is everlasting.  For those who need a biblical-sized miracle (as if this weren't enough) the account of his spontaneous, and eventually complete, recovery ought to satisfy the toughest skeptic.  An important book that anyone of any faith (or of no faith, for that matter) should read.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I purchased this after playing the free version.  I enjoyed it enough to know tat I wanted to eliminate the ads.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This is a stunning account of &#34;eye-witness&#34; testimony on life after death accomplished through hypnosis.  Though there are other fine books on the subject, this is the most comprehensive and believable I have read.  Dr. Newton's patients, with widely divergent personalities and backgrounds, come up with similar-to-identical &#34;memories&#34; of the Heaven our souls have left and the life scripts we've brought to earth.  We are shown the exciting welcome we receive upon our return to our &#34;true home&#34;, introduced to &#34;soul groups&#34; who incarnate together lifetime after lifetime assigned to different roles in each other's lives.  We learn that there truly are &#34;guardian angels&#34; - spirit guides assigned to us who follow us through various lives through eternity, always lovingly at-hand to protect us.  And once again, it's affirmed that love is the driving factor of this and  the many universes that exist outside of time.  For some, this information will be &#34;suspicions confirmed&#34; - for others, new material entirely.  But anyone with a drive to learn what lies &#34;behind the veil&#34; will be riveted by this material.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you can enjoy now and again.Great 2D and 3D imaging,awesome effects and characters!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm still not sure how I feel about the events that transpire in this book, but it feels like the only conclusion that could have been to the trilogy.  Regardless, it was as compelling and engrossing as the first two, and again I had a hard time putting it down.
B001NFU5WE|3.0|The thing that pissed me off about this item was the fact that there was a huge orange sticker slapped on the back therefore obscuring the back info on the movie. When I peeled it off SLOWLY and CAREFULLY, it tore off a piece of the back print from the movie case. I'm very disappointed with a large bright sticker being slapped on the back. It has no business being placed there!!!
0062101897|5.0|A great book for the Harry Potter enthusiast. Wonderful illustration, lots of details about the production. A must have if you like the Harry Potter movies. Provides details about the characters and the production.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|Muy Buenos Dìas.<br />Este es un excelente producto,he recibido muy buenos<br />comentarios de mis clientes.<br />Tener en cuenta que si funciona en dispositivos MAC.
0062215507|5.0|Detailed book includes description of the wizardry in the movies. Easy to read and follow, great illustrations. Highly recommended for children or adults.
B000002ADT|5.0|Very fine jazz dated only by the year it was recorded. However the style and depth of this music is not lost to this generation. Thank you
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My kids just love this album.  We have it on all our mp3 players.  We listen to it all the time
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Wow, that is all I can say. When did pop music actually get good? When Kesha's first album came out I more latched on to just the catchy hooks, and was looking forward to more, not that it was anything special, just to add some variety to my barrage of hard and heavy music I needed balanced out. Katy Perry's Teenage Dream was welcoming, and musically sound, and after years of waiting, Kesha delivers Warrior. Amazing. The album was well worth the wait<br /><br />The album kicks off with the title track and hooks you on with the chorus right from the get go. What continues is a nonstop catchy and infectious pop and dance cornucopia. It's difficult to sit still with the majority of tracks on the album, you have to get up and get moving. Thinking of You, Wonderland, and Love into the Light offer moments of reprieve and balance for the rest of the album. As for the rest of the album, prepare to move, especially to Dirty Love featuring Iggy Pop. It's already hard to resist any song featuring Iggy, and this one is impossible not to like.<br /><br />Lyrically the album offers a little bit more depth than her previous works. While many of the themes remain the same (sex, drinking, partying), Warrior is also an encouragement for listeners to step and fight for their beliefs, and die young is about living life as if each moment was your last.<br /><br />Again, great album. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game and it is free so you do not have to buy a lit of games it is a great game you should get it
B004LWZWGK|5.0|OK, confessions first.  First, I'm a total Batman fan.  As a superhero, he's topnotch because he's just an ordinary guy who takes on evil under his own power with no special \\"superhuman\\" attributes.  Well, yeah, he does have some really cool toys...  The only Batman movie I don't own is the one with that Clooney guy...puhleeze!  Second confession:  I think Christian Bale is seriously hot.  And I also think he's one of the top 5 actors today, along with DeNiro, Hackman, Neeson, and Pacino.  From silly fun like \\"Reign of Fire\\" or \\"Terminator Salvation\\" to \\"The Prestige\\" or \\"The Machinist\\" one thing you can always count on with a Bale movie is that he is going to give it everything he's got.  He never calls it in; he inhabits his roles as if he really is that person.<br /><br />All that said, in my humble opinion, this is the best Batman movie ever made.  The acting, the script, the casting, the CGI, cinemetography, sets, music, everything is absolutely flawless.  It's obvious from the first frame to the last that the utmost care went into getting this movie perfect.  Other reviewers have outlined the story, and even given some spoilers, so no need for me to tell you what it's about.  What you do need to know is that:  It's full of heartstopping, edge-of-your-seat, exciting action; it's got a great story with an evil bad guy, Bane;  it's touching and emotional, with a final resolution that brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I saw The Dark Knight Rises in the theater with my Grandson and Son in Law; bought the DVD as soon as it was available and have watched it several times since then (4? 5?) and each time I've gotten something new from it.  It's a story of redemption, renewal, and resolution.  It's a story of extreme determination to overcome, and of finding the strength and will to heal, and get up to fight another battle and then giving it all you've got, and doing it again until you do overcome the evil.  We so need a Batman.  We need heroes who will, no matter the cost, keep fighting until the bad man is no more.  That's what The Dark Knight Rises is about.<br /><br />And it's our last Christian Bale Batman movie.  It's a fitting coda to his run.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|All in all a pretty awesome album. Russell Crowe's singing is a little lacking for such a powerful character as Javert. Can't stop listening though! Anne Hathaway never ceases to amaze me, such a powerful performance makes me cry just listening! Hugh Jackman is impressive as always! Can't wait to actually see the film!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to start, fun throughout, and just challenging enough to keep you coming back. Very glad I downloaded this game.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy doing puzzles so like this App. However, not all the puzzles I download show up in my puzzles to do. Other than that very enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Damn you Coin dozer.  I have spent way too much time on this addictive game. Almost 50k coins and keeps winning. What's next?  How many coins can a person have?  Are there no more puzzles?  I need more.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I got this cd for Christmas from my brother, its one of the best Greatest hits album thats made, I enjoy every song on here, including her new ones and the Christmas one too, I especially like the one called Dont Rush with Vince Gill. I remember seeing Kelly Clarkson in 2002 during the American Idols tour and I've been a fan ever since her Idol days, I have every one of her albums so far including her DVDs as well. This one is definilty worth the wait ever since it came out in November, every song is great on her all her hits one cd, I would highly recommend this one to any pop music fan or Kelly Clarkson fan out there. You won't be disappointed at all. One of the best albums of the year of 2012, Kelly Clarkson you rock, you are one my favorite artists today and a very talented one with the voice that you have, A++++++++++ for this album.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Might be the best of the mystery writers out there now. Much better than Larsson and most of the American writers still working. Snowman is well thought out and moves at a good pace. Great lines and characters.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read one or two books about people with cancer and seen plenty of movies but this book is different. So different and I'm sad it's over. I just couldn't put it down.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Wonderfully atmospheric with magnificent graphics. The music and story hold the minigames together into one seamless whole. Beautiful! I can only recommend this game to young and old alike.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Easy read, interesting topic easy to determine what will happen though. Great for a free book and you have some free time to kill
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Great Christmas story! My son loves reading this book together. Good Christmas tradition to start with the family. Merry Christmas!
B00633W614|5.0|I first heard Jeffrey Archer interviewed on the radio when he was hawking Not A Penny More Not A Penny Less. Have since read 90% of his books. Loved them all. Can't wait for the last installment of the Clifton Chronicles.
B001383XT8|5.0|This pedal gives AWESOME distortion! It sounds great playing old AC DC Megadeth or turn the dial down for a dirty sound
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book is fascinating and I'm learning a lot about history. Who knew that Lenin was funded by the Germans to the tune of 100K rubles a month?
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've only used this 2 times and I am not real sure that it is what I really was looking for,
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Fun to play. Difficult enough to be interesting. Clues give enough information if you get stuck and map a great help in identifying rooms you have not been in yet. YOU WON'T GET HINTS AND MAP UNTIL YOU ARE A LITTLE INTO THE GAME.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Not that big on facebook but I do like looking at my grandchildrens messages and pics and it is easier to view on my Kindle
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Once you get to the first ending, you will immediately repeat for the other endings! Awesome game, get it now!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is the best search engine that was ever created. I totally dislike BING! The problem is getting BING GONE!
1451695195|5.0|It was great reading. I am facinated by near death experiences. This book took you to a whole new place and makes you realized more about the after life..I would recommend this book to any believer and especially non belivers..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THough I have a calulator on my phone this calulator seems easier to use on my Kindle Fire. Just bring it up and use a larger keyboard!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Look at the cover, then look at the price, then look in your wallet. If you have the cash or one of those magical pieces of plastic that let's you buy things when you DON'T have cash handy...,BUY THE MOVIE.  A group of &#34;superheroes&#34; bands together forming an unlikely alliance to save the world. Hilarity and action ensues.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I like the movie, it was just as good as the first maybe better. I would recommend this move to anybody. Theres action, comedy all in one. Great all around movie.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy everything about this movie. Honestly if they stopped with this I'd be happy. Did not much like the second it seemed they tried too hard to force humor. Obviously I reserve judgment on the third installment since it hasn't been released yet. Anyway fora well rounded film that give you everything you want and more get iron man. How's this for a review that doesn't give away a single thing?
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Total Recall was totally awesome, even better than the original!!! Lots of action and special effects, a tremendous thrill ride!!!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I bought this for my daughther-in-law for Christmas and she is a big fan of the show. She has all of the other seasons and enjoyed this season very much.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I first downloaded this for my 7 yr old grandson. Then my 3 yr old granddaughter wanted to play. Eventually I was hooked.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I bought this movie for my adult sons. It has great humor and they both enjoyed it. I even enjoyed it, but then again I really like the two main actors in this movie.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I found the book hard going at first but I'm glad I kept going because it all came together in the end. I've seen reviews where people say the characters are horrible but I disagree because the more you learn about them, the more you understand why they are like they are. The book did make me think about how we judge people because you do form certain opinions about the characters in the beginning and then you change your mind as you get to understand more about their background. I didn't expect a fairytale ending because that's not real life - and I think that's what makes the book really thought provoking. It will make a brilliant BBC series.
B004VYYA2K|1.0|NEAT-OH! BARBIE ZIPBIN DREAM HOUSE. IT'S 9:24P.M. CHRISTMAS EVE AND STILL ISN'T HERE. LOOKS LIKE THERES A CHANCE IT MIGHT NOT SHOW UP WHEN SANTA SHOWS UP. IT'S JUST MY GRANDAUGHTER SO WHO CARES.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book!! I can't wait until the next book is released. The author just keeps you wanting more. I would recommend this book to any one.
1451695195|5.0|This book is full of wonderful details and certainly gives much food for thought.  Anyone who fears dying may find this comforting.
B002E3JVHE|3.0|Along with John Williams, Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer. My favorite scores of his are Inception and Nolan's Batman trilogy. This is his music, except it's from the City of Prague Philharmonic. The music is nice, but you should just listen to the originals. These versions don't add anything, and the tracks choices are random. You might like some, you might not. This isn't bad, but you should just get Zimmer's original tracks.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|Didn't fit my Kindle Fire HD, so I gave it to a grandaughter who did have a Kindle Fire, so it worked out okay.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|That wonderful voice coming out of that young man!  &#34;The trouble with girls&#34; is my favorite.  I hope Scotty's career lasts a long time.

B000B589JI|1.0|Quality of this product leaves much to be desired. Must replace nozzle cap washer or make thread longer :( So basically it doesn't work out of box
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This stand works great for my iPhone 4 WHEN IT IS NOT IN IT'S CASE.  The case I have is just shy of 2 1/2 inches wide, and I couldn't get the phone into the stand while it was in it's case. When outside of it's case, or in a smaller case, the stand works like a dream.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read!<br />I couldn't put this book down. Colleen, you are amazing! I'm looking forward to your next book! Hurry with it, won't you? :-)
B0053TMP24|5.0|Yet again, Rick Riordan captures us in the second edition of his spin-off series. The descriptions, building of characters, and mish-mash of modern and ancient beliefs enthrall readers. Although many may miss Percy's sarcasm, there is still a healthy amount sprinkled throughout the book.
B009VB97EY|4.0|It was ok. Very predictable and slow at times. The acting was decent. Dancing was good. Burlesque was much better.
B00447L4JG|5.0|The DVD arrived in a timely manner. It was in brand new condition and worked great! My son loves this movie and watches it all the time!
B0049P1VHS|2.0|As much as I personally love the post cataclysm and zombie setting this series just isn't interesting enough to watch.  While most drama in this genre (like many others) is driven by contrived circumstances usually the narrative is engaging enough that this becomes less overt and almost unnoticeable. Sadly in the case of \\"the Walking dead\\" the simplistic and contrived plot points blend pointlessly and uninterestingly into one another and then are then sprinkled with absurdity and banality.  The story literally advances as you expect every step of the way, there is no interesting dialog, action, or interaction between characters, the environment, or even among story lines.  A character is presented, his role immediately identified, and his story arc predicted with near certainty.  It's not particularly entertaining to watch the uninspired characters, their inane behavior, or the 3rd grade dialog unfold when you already know the underwhelming conclusion.  Worse still, the band of characters are forgettable and essentially boring, Han Solo and Bobafet may be one dimensional but at least they're interesting.  Even Shrek had layers. Watching this show is an exercise in tedium, I kept waiting for it to get interesting, but that never happened.  I watched the whole first season and it seemed that at some point it might become interesting, plus it's well reviewed by people who clearly think it is interesting, but much like a side scroller you can solve with button mashing your time is likely better spent on another original series out there that is more then a few steps from terrible, or at least engaging.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Of all of MM's roles, this is by far his best. He plays the hot shot lawyer who gets sucked into a wacky case. The plot is amazing & all of the main & extra characters play their roles great. Very enjoyable!
B0053O89Z6|4.0|I can't get enough of this show. In season 7, the characters once again grow appropriately for their age range - Marshall & Lily prepare to be parents while Barney and Robin each realize they may be ready for long-term relationships after all. Ted, ever on the search for Mrs. Right, learns to focus on himself for a while. It's an emotional season, and one not to be missed.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great movie for the family!  Rented this movie from Amazon through our new Sony HTIB which made it too easy to rent, but provided a fun evening for hunkering down on a cold winter night.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Great writing and brilliant storytelling never go out of style. The wit, wisdom, and insight of Sherlock Holmes, and the observations of his long-suffering BFF, Watson, will continue to entertain and educate the attentive reader for years to come.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The options are incredible for the price.  I'm a chronic doodler and professional artist.  I'5's my Christmas present to me.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Five seasons and still going strong! I once again the hilarious antics of the well-tuned cast. Sheldon continues to grow in his understanding of humanity through his relationships with Amy and Penny and sad-sacks Leonard and Raj provide plenty of emo laughs, but the season is ultimately stolen by Simon Helberg's portrayal of Howard Wolowitz.  A creepy wannabe ladies' man no more, Howard faces the demons in his past and present as he prepares to marry Bernadette. For fans of the show, Season 5 will not disappoint.
B0031SCV46|5.0|So far, it works great. I haven't been able to use it much, but it serves its purpose well as a basic midi controller with velocity sensitive keys.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Eban Alexander was not particularly religious. In fact, he had decided several years prior to his near-death experience that he didn't even believe in God.  He has devoted his entire life to science, and has put his career at risk to execute what he now considers to be the most important task in his life: delivering to us the message from beyond that we are infinitely loved and cherished. Despite not having been religious, he echoes themes written in the works of C.S. Lewis and the apostle Paul, among others. As a Christian, I have not tidied up how theology ties to his experience, but I do believe that what he experienced is real.<br /><br />It is up to you whether to believe him or not, but at least read what he has to say before deciding.
0811879542|5.0|This book is so cute. It tells the child what to do with simple instructions and is very easy to follow. Definately suggest buying it for your little one.
B008X8QCTO|3.0|Been playing this for a week, got the extra content for free, was a good game so didn't mind paying an extra 99 cent, they were having a special which is why i got for free over the weekend.  Shut down to do some errands (i am now in the bonus chapter) and i try to open it back up and get the following message 6 times now, ERROR  mnt/sdcard/android/data/com.alawar.weirdbrokentune.kindlefire/files/game.xml(permission denied).<br /><br />Never have these problems with any other apps, don't know if i would ever purchase a game from alawar again. I play these game to relax not to get frustrated.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It was a little hard to figure some of the different tiles.  Which ones go with what but overall it's a good game.
B008M721MS|4.0|it is nice it is usually very good thano you for all belonging . tiff thatch discs discarded reassessed x . xsxssxxszszsszzz sax
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is so so so so Good!!!!! It will make you laugh,cry, and more importantly teaches us about the value and importance of friendship. Logan Lerman is an Incredible actor. His character reminds me a lot of myself in high school. Emma Watson was great (as expected) in her supporting role. And hats off to Ezra Miller who did a wonderful job as Patrick. His character has made me come to a realization that all people, no matter who or what they are, should be accepted; that said,  I really loved his character in the movie. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is more than just a teen drama; It IS real life stuff.  This is a movie that will have a lasting impact on me for a long time. I Will be the first to buy this movie and watch it again and again. This IS one of the best of films of 2012!!!<br /><br />5 Well Deserved Stars<br /><br />\\"And in this moment I swear, We are Infinite\\"
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|This is the first RE movie I missed in theatres, and I'm really unhappy that I did.  Before I rented it tonight via Amazon, I was a little hesitant and I read the reviews.<br /><br />I have a question for those of you who wrote negative reviews:  Were you expecting the works of Shakespeare when you watched this movie?<br /><br />The previous installment looked absolutely horrible in the trailers and I went into it fully expecting it to be awful.  Given those expectations, it far exceeded my worst fears and it actually was horrible, but I loved every single second of it.  (Especially the shower fight scene.)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; SPOILERS AHEAD >><br /><br />With this one, I expected even worse and it delivered triumphantly.  I really enjoyed this one.  I loved seeing Carlos and Rain back.  I hated seeing Luther die at the end, most likely permanently this time.  I wish they could've brought more characters back.  LJ was a great character and lived through the entire book series.<br /><br />I didn't expect a high-quality movie when I rented this.  I expected blood, I expected zombies and monsters, I expected lots of bullets, and I expected pretty cool fights scenes.<br /><br />RE: Retribution delivered it all and I couldn't be happier with it.
B006O6F932|5.0|My 6-year-old loves it!  She opened it this Christmas morning. It might fall apart with a four-year-old, but for 6 and up, it is very stable. Really no problems there like a few people have said. Useful accessories and not too many that they just get thrown aside. The lockers are great with the removeable skull locks. You can figure out who some of the lockers belong to by looking inside. Others you can personalize with the stickers. We wrote first names on them with a Sharpie. Moms and dads can learn a lot about the characters on Wikipedia. My favorite feature is the Gargoyles \\"protecting\\" the school at the entrance!  Have fun.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|No, not one of the books I would take to a deserted island with me. It started ok and I did finish the whole book, but I found it all a bit boring.
B004LZEV4Q|4.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter when my son-in-law was deployed overseas so she could hear his voice. It really helped.  Only draw back, it was too easy for her to erase his words.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Enjoy playing it and the rules are good.  Keeps my interest and not too hard to win by using the hints
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It's OK.  As a tribute to the original, it wsa enjoyable, but it isn't much on its own.  had some very good acting, and some terrible acting.  A few interesting twists.  Would have been better if it were a &#34;new generation&#34; insted of a &#34;remake.&#34;
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love playing it , but often get stumped as I progress to the higher levels.  Enjoy the variety of the games.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins managed to capture my broken heart from the ending of the Harry Potter series. She is a wonderful author that literally takes you on a journey that will leave  you on the edge of your seat. Job well done and kudos to Collins! This series is a MUST read!
B00936A0RU|4.0|It's better than expected would watch again on rainy day.The acting was good and the story line is as expected as well.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is without a doubt,one of THE BEST movies ever made.It has such a great moral message to it.It's really a shame that most of the movies that come out today,don't have that same morality that this great film has.The story is very inspriational and touching.Whenever life gets you down or you get depressed about something,just pop in this dvd,and it will remind you...that this is a WONDERFUL LIFE.Merry Christmas everybody.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The action is awesome with a great story line, Don't have to worry about sensual scenes. It is a great movie to watch over and over again.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This was disappointing for the Bourne series. The action was entertaining enough but the plot was weak and poorly done.  Many plot lines were never resolved or even returned to after taking up significant screen time.
B00866JL96|4.0|would definately recommend for a good chick flick for mature adults, the sensual scenes are a bit too much for teens to watch unless parents are there to skip the 3 scenes that show a bit too much.
0316232955|5.0|This book is an amazing book! I did not have a really good laugh in awhile! Thank you Chris for writing this book, it's amazing!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Super smooth - seriously, that's the best part and it's noticeable. Everything you need in an e-mail app plus that something extra that makes it better than the others.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have had World of Goo on my home PC for a few years now. It is one of my favorite games to play.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Like many other reviewers here I was FRUSTRATED with how difficult to build the structures by stacking the blocks up on their hollowed-out sides. Then I did a little bit of research (ok, a lot more than I should have) -- YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO. If you look at the reviews of the first game (Angry Birds: Knock on Wood)  you'll see it's mostly positive -- WHY? Because in that game, the packaging CLEARLY shows the structures built on the pieces' STURDY sides -- yes -- on their SIDES, not on their hollowed-out areas.<br /><br />The problem is with the illustrations in the included rules and the packaging itself. That -- and parents who are afraid of breaking the rules. In the new packaging, the box illustrations show that the pieces are stacked on their rickety sides (except you WILL notice that two ice blocks are stacked on their sturdy sides). Also, the right/wrong illustration included in the rules likewise only shows the blocks being stacked on their rickety sides, so the general consensus is that ONLY this is right.<br /><br />It takes a bit of digging up the old packaging box illustrations to put ones mind at ease -- and there's a bit in the rules that can easily be missed: \\"ANY SIDE of a girder can face forward (page 3, 5th paragraph, 2nd sentence of \\"Let's Play!\\"<br /><br />So you see folks -- YOU CAN build the structures on their solid sides and not feel bad about 'breaking any rules'! In fact, with the way they're built, you can choose whether to build a solid, hard-to-knock-down structure; or a rickety, easy-to-demolish one depending on who you're trying to let win :P (especially if it's just Daddy and Junior playing).<br /><br />Now regarding the fun value -- it does seem pointless to spend all that time building a structure and having to knock it all down after two birds have missed it entirely. Waste of time! But don't let that discourage you! Why not make up house rules? If a structure is undamaged -- go again for free! The point is to HAVE FUN. I decided not to tell my kids \\"Sorry, you CAN'T do that -- coz the rules say so!\\" Instead, parent's should FIND a way to keep the game flowing.<br /><br />...and that's what the educational value is for. For PARENTS to THINK, not just the kids! Kids can find all sorts of ways to play this -- why can't the parents make up a few rules? Another point is that it keeps the kids away from their parents' iPads and iPhones. Anything that does that is good educational value : P ~!<br /><br />Still, there is something to be said about the time setting up the structures and lack of 'officially' fun rules. The point I addressed earlier is the biggest of these boo-boos. If you go by official rules, you WILL feel frustrated. Still, I suppose if you just persevere, you WILL figure out how to work the launcher to a science and will be knocking down those structures all the time. Then you'll wonder what all the negative comments on the launcher were about in the first place.<br /><br />Go ahead folks -- enjoy the game!to tell my kids \\"Sorry, you CAN'T do that -- coz the rules say so!\\" Instead, parent's should FIND a way to keep the game flowing.<br /><br />...and that's what the educational value is for.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|I bought this the same time I bought the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD thinking it would fit.  Not sure why it wouldn't fit since the Kindle Fire HD is 7 inches and the case is supposed to be 7.6.  The case is too small.  Maybe I was sent the wrong one.  The description says it is for Kindle Fire.  I don't think the description is very clear as to which Kindle this is for.  I will  need to return.  Not very pleased.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down. Best new book I have read so far. I jumped right into the second one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book will \\"live\\" on your soul for days after you complete it. A little slow to get started but necessary for character development this allegory may leave you puzzled as well as troubled. However it opens topics that are great for dinner fable discussions. I am glad I read it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|He does it again! The lucky one was a great read couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed this Nicholas Sparks novel.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|What would Christmas be without this classic movie. It is a must see every year. Watch it with the family and enjoy Christmas!
B002WY65W4|5.0|Great movie, so I must give it 5 stars.  But be aware digital copy has expired 2/2/11.  You will have to use a tool like DVDFab to make legal backups.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|As always, Hoffman and Streep, two of the most talented and versatile actors in filme, deliver great performances.  A great story that leaves you with your own doubts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good job . Making me gives review what a joke haha 9 more words required. Can't wait to be done
B000063DS1|5.0|Outstanding Box set featuring one of largest farewell shindiggs ever undertaken By one band. Allstar lineup with complete history , and coverage of the event included.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This is just great movies for any collection and definitely is a great value.  We have very much enjoyed enjoyed adding them to our collection,
B00026WU64|5.0|Another masterpiece by the poet and self made master of folk art. I also have this on vynal and cassette.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The best of the Star Wars definitely.  Always a great movie and an enjoyable evening.  Can't go wrong with this trilogy.
B0025KVLT2|4.0|One of My all time favorites. I do, of course, have it on vynal and cassette. A must have. I think I am beginning to show My age.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I wish I could give this game  more stars, I really do. It's a fun game but I can't play using my facelift account. I keep getting internal server errors that prevent my account from doing anything. Fix that, so that I can start earning rewards, and I will change my number of stars and review.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|A masterpiece. Have it on vynal and cassette. Young people do not know what They are missing if They have not experienced this music. If They do not like it, They know nothing about music.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They did an amazing job with there music. I listen to it many times. Hoping they do another. I wish they had all their music from YouTube on this though.
B000089RV6|3.0|Not One of My favotites. More talent has been demonstrated Through the Years. Already have it on vynal, and cassette. Not much changed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. I couldn't stop reading it. I will definitely be reading it again. So amazing!
B007L96VCY|5.0|I have this recording on vynal and cassette. I purchased the cd. in order to have another format. I was delighted and surprised to receive the bonus disk with great tracks I had never before heard.
B000MKD9P6|2.0|After much encouragement from my chic, we watched this boring flick. It was like watching the same scene over and over again. The devil was one-dimensional, the protagonist was weak. One good point- my chic said I could choose the next three movies.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|One of the best efforts of a professional musicion to tantilize the ears of anyone able to truly appreciate the talents of a truly gifted master.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|This album is amazingly creative, soulful, full of beautiful songs, powerful lyrics, and Emeli's GORGEOUS voice (seriously it's like velvet)! You can honestly keep it on repeat all day and not get sick of it. Emeli Sand&eacute; is so talented, and so open and expressive! I am already looking forward to her next project and hoping that she does a U.S. tour so I can see her live.
B000002KCV|5.0|Loved this record so much that My buddies found Me a used copy, and gave it to Me for one of My many birthdays. Still have the vynal one, of course. Now have it on CD.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter loves her Lego set.  With lots of pieces, she can be creative in a variety of ways.  She will get lots of years out of this set!
B003Y8YXFS|4.0|Have the original vynal record, and now am able to enjoy the cd format. Who in Thier right mind doesn't care for John Lennon's genious?
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|YEAH...first listen.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a powerful narative. I found The Pact to be incredibly touching. It illustrates how vital honest communication is between family members. Circumstances and behaviors in life, at times, present love with some very challenging and difficult choices; life and death choices, the consequences of those choices and the impact on love.
B008469DGY|5.0|My poppy loves golf. he always tells me to try it. So i did. It is super fun. I would recommend this game for you.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|The whole family loved it! It was great to get everyone in the holiday spirit and even the grumpy kids looked up from their iPhones to watch some of the movie!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|She has always enjoyed Michael Bible and really likes the Christmas CD. I would recommend this CD to all fans of the Buble
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like this game a lot. Great game much fun. My favorite part is breeding the Dragons. Hoody dowdy polite. Saskatoon the Dragons and other words from the university.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This DVD was a gift for a big John Wayne fan. I believe they are enjoying the movie on this Fine Christmas Day
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is mentally stimulating  and I have really enjoyed playing it. The music is really soothing and the puzzles are fun.
0525478817|5.0|It is a great book, it really shows that love can be demonstrated in such random acts, a must read
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|By far one of the best books I have read! Mind blowing and spectacular twists. Could not have asked for a better ending.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Would recommend this book to anyone who likes Lee Child or any other action or drama author.  John Cory at his best.
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|This is a great video of one of the greatest artists of our time.  The video and audio quality are exceptional and I could listen to it for hours.  So sad he no longer performs live, but this is about as close as you can get.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Although many people hold a certain stereotype to sparks books, there are always other elements then just a typical love story that make the novels much more interesting and unique. The twist at the end really draws together the whole story. Fantastically written.
B0000X61VE|4.0|I had purchased Shape Your Body Workout when it first came out on VHS. I loved it then and since I'm older I love it even more. This is a low impact but gets your heart rate up, and works every muscle in your body. This DVD is great for toning up.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read only one day probably and entertaining, nice , funny , smart meg , meets dashing Conner. They have  a lot in common and not a lot to loose
B00AESN8XY|3.0|So I went to 4shared and got it for free. I have to have more words to complete this, so by reading this, you have wasted your time. K bai.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author put himself at risk of ridicule and skepticism to reveal a true message of love.  What a gift in times like these, where religious zealots turn the basic message of faith into something divisive and ugly.  I wish I could buy a copy for everyone I know...and millions more.
B001NAT07A|1.0|I could see some women enjoying the message of the movie, and the Romantic scenes. But realistically, the acting was terrible, the script was plain, the lines were corny. The backdrop of the movie and how Cat Women comes into being, is actually interesting, but the movie tale spins into a lame story line. I see there has been allot of reviews on this movie, so I will stop there. I felt Compelled to give this movie a bad review.
0763644765|5.0|Call it coincidence, but it wasn't long after starting to read this book that our 16-month-old daughter decided she wanted to start trying to tinkle in the potty. We're calling that a victory! :-)
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great book in the series.  Hard to put down once you've started.  If you haven't met Harry borsch, mows the time to start
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Did not finish this book. Did not enjoy it so decided to stop after the 7th chapter. I instead read a different type of book.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|A great family movie! Much better than I expected! We loved it! I strongly recommend it for family movie night!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|We really enjoyed the music in this movie. Anna Kendrick was adorable. Humor and depiction of college life made this movie fun.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|I wanted to really like this movie; I've been meaning to watch it forever and have heard SUCH great things about it.  I found the idea of an R rated Christmas movie sort of strange, but gave it a go anyway.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />A LOT of gratuitous nudity; including at least a dozen bare breasts.<br />A cheating husband, or, at least a husband who desires to cheat.<br />Some gestures of 'love' that were sweet, but inappropriate (declarations of love to an already married woman)<br />Colin going to America simply to have sex with American women - since British ones won't have him; as if sex is the definition of love<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Liam Neeson's relationship with his stepson<br />Rowan Atkinson - I one hundred and ten percent LOVED him in this movie<br />Hugh Grant and his story line - if he ran from prime minister I'd vote for him!<br /><br />All in all, it's cute, but if I were to watch it again, I wish there would be a way to choose only certain storylines to follow (ie. Liam Neeson's and Hugh Grant's)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game on the kindle. I love it. its awesome playing on here I also really enjoy playing this game.its great. your not waisting no time playing at all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The front cover boasts a review that proclaims, &#34;The best superhero movie of all time,&#34; and I think I agree. Marvel did a brilliant job of staying true to all the characters in this film. Also, I have to congratulate all the actors for making their respective characters so believable, especially when they were learning to work together as a team.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it good game. get game. it is a very fun and time consuming game. it will keep you occupied. I would get the game if I were you.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This is one of the best dramas I have seen in a long time. The story is engaging and the cinematography is beautiful. I will watch this one again and again.
B003UYUP58|4.0|I am a medical oncologist and enjoeyed the book and now recommended it to my heme/onc fellows starting their training.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson and it was one of her best cds with all of best songs! Play it all the time and would recommend to everyone!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of Goo is free today and it is tons of fun. Merry Christmas. Amazon gave you an amazing game.
B0041CGP02|5.0|HUGE BON JOVI FAN!SEEN THEM MANY TIMES AND WILL ALWAYS BE THEIR #1 FAN! JON BON JOVI GETS HOTTER WITH AGE!
B0046B1KHG|1.0|and instead received an on line download.  Please, do not mix two different products with what is being requested.  I felt it was a Sales Trap!  Keep your downloaded crap, it is not what I believed I was purchasing.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|There was a lot of action in the movie but what I like the most is that you never knew, until the end, who was who and who was working for who.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I swear that the topic of the item requested should be the only KIND of item that you see.  In this case a DVD and I received A DVD  thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever so if you disagree you can eat white dog crap.this game is boss you hear
B009JBZH54|1.0|Husband went to open on christmas morning to find out that it was missing 1 disc, The Dark Knight Rises Feature Movie, wont make the amazon mistake again, should have bought at costco. Will be returning.
B000024ECB|5.0|Earth, Wind & Fire are my favorite group to listen to.  I love some of their songs and play them over and over.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this because it was a great price. When it came it was in great shape and worked well.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My daughter and I are Scottish and enjoy movies that lean toward stories that have a Scottish bent to them.  This movie was fun to watch and we thoroughly liked the character with her bright red hair.  It is a movie we will watch over and over.
0345803485|5.0|Good read...a taint bit naughty. Looking forward to the next one. Arived promptly and the book was in excellent shape
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Wife and I enjoyed the movie but I'm not going to say this is amazing.  If your in the mood it's worth the time.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Was delivered in an awesome yellow keeper box and covered in protective plastic, even on the band.  Had to take out a couple of links cause it's a big band, but it is very nice and well made.  Love it.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|It was a plausable SiFi that was well concieved and the acting was good.  The special effects were very good and over all I think it deserves a four star.  I will recommend it to my friends.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A great way to have a few laughs druing the hoidays. A silly movie but worth watching.Any time you want a laugh..
B005LAIHRC|4.0|I didn't know Julianne Hough before this movie, seems my wife did. Apparently Ms Hough is a former Dancing With the Stars standout, or something similar. Her dance performances in this movie are excellent, especially a fantasy scene where she is solo on a balcony. And she is excellent as a singer with a voice I enjoyed in spite of an overly nasal \\"twang\\" that seems less pronounced when she is speaking. I found her at her best singing duets, she has an ear for harmonizing.<br /><br />I was shocked to discover that Tom Cruise sang his numbers. I watched the end music/song credits hoping to discover who had been his voice stand end. Then I watched some of the extras, one of which contained a featurette with Def Leopard on site at the movie set watching Cruise rehearse one of their rock anthems. They seemed genuinely Impressed. And so was I.<br /><br />The movie's story line is cold, you have seen dozens of these pictures before. Small town girl/boy comes to the bright lights-big city looking for an opportunity to be in show business. Takes a job around show business, circumstance provides the big break with the hero or heroine being supplied needed support to get through it all by a love interest or patron. From \\"Young Man with a Horn\\" to \\"Coyote Ugly\\" the story has been done to death.<br /><br />But the production set pieces, the music and dance, this is where you either like it or ...... And this one I liked. I'm a man of a certain age and the covers were terrific.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Very entertaining and fun movie. If I had to put them in order of favorites, this would be second to the first movie of the series!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great read, however it only took me a few hours to complete. So if you are looking for substance this isn't for you. If you want a quick journey into the macabre this is for you though.
B0014NDXGA|2.0|The new item that I ordered arrived as a refurbished package. There was a note saying that it was the same as the original product, but it is not.. There is no battery included, so we were not able to try it. There was also no manual, but we find it online so at least we know now  which battery to order.  Quite embarassing since this was a Christmas gift for someone.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I play it all the time for great music sound and used in travel in the car for music. A+
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Everything's good. It just needs a little tweaks here and there and it's perfect. I liked how descriptive it was. Wish it were longer!
B008M721MS|5.0|this is really cool and usefull you can read an  play games and stuff I love it so much fun can I stop this review now
B001AQO3QA|5.0|But it a gift I will not know what they thank about it till after XMas I like the Box it came in.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Fonts and background work better.<br />Haven't been able to connect for Bible plans Android devocionals because no valid email, password nor user name are accepted<br />Also, it is a bit heavier to move.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|All I could I think to say was awful. It was painful to watch the first hour. This movie is like Sherlock Holmes the action adventure film.
B00AAQUCAM|5.0|If you go in for live Zappa this album rates near the best official live releases I've heard.  For first timers interested in  exploring the live Zappa experience I'd still recommend Roxy & Elsewhere or YCDTOSA Volume 1 but If you have those already then you can't miss with this one. Any live disc that includes the trio of \\"Florentine Pogen\\" \\"Andy\\" \\"Inca Roads\\" is a winner in my book, so long as sound quality is there. And as this is an official release it's there (I'm referring of course to the \\"Beat the boots\\" volumes - buyer beware).
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Downloaded it and used it last night.  Not sure it helped me fall asleep, but pretty sure it actually kept me up.  Will have to play with it some more before I decide if I am going to keep it.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|One more game to go mindless during the times when I need to.  Almost like playing it in the arcade.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very pleased with this app and have nothing but good things to say about it.  This app is helping to keep my Mahjong addiction fed.  Love the fact that you can expand the screen so you can see the tiles better.  Get this app if you are a Mahjong addict too!
B005HSL626|5.0|Now this is a game the grandson loves.  It trains him in hand eye coordination.  Highly recommend<br />Halfbrick Studios Pty Ltd.  This is a downloadable item as well.
B004YXE438|4.0|Love this game! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because a couple of the puzzles have a solid Colorado background and some of the pieces are pretty much impossible to get turned around the right way and in the right spot to actually &quot;finish&quot; the puzzle.
B004SBX112|5.0|This a game we play from time to time and want to go mindless.  Oh right, i am 61 and still need a mindless activity.  It is a fun game to play.  I do recommend.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Bought & paid for his on my Kindle Fire HD. Its NOT showing up on my Kindle, it`s NOT in my Cloud either. NO options to help me download this or anything. $3 down the drain, WTF?
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Got this game for Missile Command.  This is a game I always played in the arcade.  Love the game and do recommend it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is a fairly simple toy with lots of parts which is important when you have a burgeoning construction expert how ever don't be mistaken this is actually a game with actual rules.  If you follow the instruction and you play it on a stable platform this game can actually be fun!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A good game to play with the grandson.  He likes this game and wants to play it all the time.  But, he is reminded that chores need done and that includes taking a nap.  I do recommend.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is a classic Christmas movie that we watch every year.  It is timeless and I recommend every family have a copy of this classic.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I do not have a chance to watch this series.  Get up too early for work.  It was a good choice to buy the season.  I received a quality product that was also shipped fast.  Highly recommend vendor.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|Not a bad alarm clock.  Have it installed on my Android device and use it when I am on travel.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Wow! I didn't think I could be surprsied and fascinated with yet another Bat Man sequel. But, this one had it all. Suspense; Darkness (Of course);  Action; Exceptional Futuristic Toys; Emotional Depth; Romance; Psychological Introspection and a Surprise Ending!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I get a lot of PDF files on my iPad and needed something to open them with.  Adobe does it again.  Highly recommend if you need to read PDF files on a portable device.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A fun game to play.  There are some issues of dropping cards when dragging them but nothing major.  I can spend hours playing this game.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|If you need a simple program to do not os complicated office work, then this is for you.  Bought it some months ago, and, hardly use it.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Does not install on kindle fire, how does this make sense? I would rather die than try this product again and I am one of those crazy people who has patience.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is for the grandson, and if you have read my previous posts, he does get spoiled by his grandparents.  He likes the game a lot and we play it together.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Have been a huge fan of Everything but the Girl for years.  I absolutely love this album it is a very low key relaxing album.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A good game to play with the grandson.  He likes this game and wants to play it all the time.  But, he is reminded that chores need done and that includes taking a nap.  I do recommend.
0817439390|5.0|If you practice photography since years, even as a professional, you might want have some technical explanations or tips<br />about what you're doing.<br />I found there many answers that I never found anywhere else...<br />Nice pictures to help you understand technical concepts.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had just purchased Prometheus when I saw this.  A great price.  Completes the series for me.  Even though Alien 3 and 4 were less than great, the price made it a good deal.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A good game to play with the grandson.  He likes this game and wants to play it all the time.  But, he is reminded that chores need done and that includes taking a nap.  I do recommend.
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|I love using Amazon MP3. I can download the music I want in seconds. I can also upload to the cloud and have my music anywhere. Great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is a great help fo keeping track of all sorts of things; auto repairs, records of medicines, appliance service, and more than 400 recipes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play solitare to kill time or just for fun.  This one is my favorite of all solitare card games.  The kids love it, too.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was a gift for my mother-in-law and she loved it. She was happy with the discs (4)  and she is planning on sharing them with a sibling who does not get Showtime either. I personally have not seen the show but have heard good things about it so maybe this will help us get in the loop.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|mickey mouse. Hard to follow . very limited use. Don't recommend it.<br />eight more words required. hello, hello, hello, good bye
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This is an interesting story written from the viewpoint of an autistic young man who discovers a dead dog in a neighbor's yard, and sets out to discover who killed it. It was very enlightening to understand how he sees the world, and methods he uses to cope. I was unhappy, however, with some of the language; I prefer to avoid books where the f-bomb is dropped, but the other aspects of the book were enough to merit a four-star rating.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Active gamers figure it out right away.<br />For the rest of us it is a little clumsy.<br />Not really exciting.
0307474259|4.0|This ruins all the excuses...puts you on track.<br />Eating the right foods and exercise.<br />Enjoy the new you and be happy.
B00633W614|5.0|I love Archer's works.  I think I must have them all.  I certainly have read them all.  His style of writing is easy, free flowing and grammatically correct.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie had our entire family laughing!  We are going to purchase this movie and add to our Christmas movie collection!!!

B009E3EXMU|5.0|As much as I love Led Zeppelin this was a birthday present to my father. He like Led Zeppelin as much as I do. His birthday we watched the DVD. The CD keeps finding its way back into the CD player and he has watch the DVD twice again!<br />Great quality sound and picture.<br />awesome Led Zeppelin performance<br />Great for any Rock and Roll fan<br />a MUST for any Led Zeppelin fan!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is an awesome comic great for anywhere you go. I am so glad I got this on Kindle Five Stars!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|About 45 minutes into this film, I wanted my rental fee back. Really bad cross between Alien and 2001 a Space Odysey... I expected more from Riddley Scott.  The acting was absurd as well.
B002NWOOXW|4.0|Other viewers may not agree but I am a huge Colin Firth fan. I have had a crush on him ever since spotting him as the charming Mark Darcey in BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I loved the previous Bourne Trilogy!! No offense to Jeremy Renner, but Matt Damon was fantastic!  This movie started off intriguing, but became way too predictable with the rooftop chase scene, the car chase scene, etc.
B00821OW8K|3.0|We are currently watching this on Amazon Prime Instant video and, although the sound  quality is good, the actual streaming itself is a little ropey; \\"stuttering\\" in almost every other scene.  Hopefully this will rectify itself as we work through the season.<br /><br />The storyline itself is a little predictable; alien invaders, survivalists all the usual, with an interesting twist in the form of the harnesses.  Hints of the invasion in War of the Worlds, and a familiar, but as yet unidentified noise made by the \\"mecs\\".<br /><br />I don't think we would have paid for this, but as it's free not a bad deal at all, and a great relief from all the usual Christmas fodder.
0891419063|5.0|Very hard to put this book down. Mr. E.B. Sledge did a good job describing what he and his buddies went through during the war.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was so sad ending could have been better<br />It was too depressing<br />Better ending it should be happy!<br />It wasn't fair for katniss
B005K17RU0|5.0|the status bar updates and the fact it stays up in the menu bar and the radar is just about always right on par.
B00004XMS0|5.0|The movies are in a perfect boxed set, exactly what I was searching for to give as a Christmas gift. The seller was wonderful and offered me a refund when I contacted them to tell them I accidentally entered the wrong zipcode and was afraid my package would not arrive. Luckily my package arrived with no delay! Shipping was incredibly fast. I ordered numerous packages on black friday from countless places and this was the first one to arrive
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is the one Christmas movie that keeps on giving.  We watch it a couple of times every Holiday Season, and it never gets old.  Now on Blu Ray, the film looks pretty darned good as well.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|loved it. the walking dead is amazing. great item. i love the graphics and screw driver. very pleased with the item
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I loved this book because their was a lot of action in the events. Also I am,Team Peeta I feel bad for Gale
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great  graphic novel novel that I believe will stand as one of the greatest of all time. I also enjoyed the great story telling and drama the this story bring. Can`t wait for the next one.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got this app for my 6yr. old grandaughter..........and wow! This is a really nice drawing app for kids. Just wonderful! I highly reccommend this to everyone!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I can't believe that I'm actually finished with this lovely book. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky was a heartfelt tale of love and loneliness told through a series letters to an unnamed friend, and the author did a great job of conveying Charlie's emotions throughout the book. It is a warm coming-of-age novel I would recommend to any teenager.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very cool movie started watchin few weeks ago and was hooked.very good quality series. Love all the well thought out situations . And the characters are also great. Watch it. It's very cool..........................
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are addicted to this program ! Cant wait to see all the episodes. This a great story of survival.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|this is the 1st flash light i have.  I really want to get the SB910 but it is too much.  Ended up i chose this flash and it did the job and provided the great lighting for it.  My friend used my flash and also said it almost same as SB800.  If you are just the beginner and this flash light is really enough.
0670022705|5.0|A 12 year old today has no idea of vinyl records, typewriters etc. This puts the world into a unique perspective for kids and adults.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|I downloaded this app when it was the free app of the day. It worked perfectly for that day (yesterday). Now today there is NO sound, you can still play it, but what's the point if you can't hear it, it is a piano game after all. Like the title says, I lovED it, but now it's just a waste of space on my kindle. :( le sigh.....
B007STBUHI|5.0|My husband wanted this movie. As always I had no trouble locating it on Amazon. It arrived, well packaged , in mint condition ,sooner than expected.  He loves this movie and enjoys watching it often. My husband is a fan of older movies and I never have trouble finding them on Amazon.  Also the prices are very reasonable.
0761163808|5.0|Fascinating movement of the animals!  My grandsons loved it!!  Great gift for them--will be fun for them to take to school.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The movie is very entertaining and Rooney Mara's performance will make her a star in the near future. I loved how she changed into the beautiful blond in the ending.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|My christmas for husband was priceless. He loved the Special Edition Walking Dead. Although it is Christmas we are now force to watch zombies. But over all. Excellent.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Great special effects, acting that was good enough that it didn't distract from the movie. Lots of action. But, eh. Empty. Nothing to hold it together. No plot, no relationships between characters. It was missing something. And I think that something was me caring. I was bored.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, and love me a good (or even mediocre) super hero film (ala Batman, Kick Ass, X-Men). I'm a gal that plays violent video games and enjoys zombie flicks and action movies with the best of them, but I got a little naggy headache while watching Transformers in the theater. I have come to know this headache as a sign of an empty, over-the-top, CG heavy action movie, and it returned while watching this 2.5h bloated beast.<br /><br />So I would say, if you get pumped by films like Transformers, then this might be a good bet for you.
B0040JHLLI|5.0|I have gotten the Adrenaline's since the 8th generation and they always work great for me.  I intend to get the 12's next year also.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Uneven. Some stories are spellbinding, others just miss. I used to teach her short stories in a sophomore English at a CC and loved them. So when I read, I'm thinking: how would I teach this one or that one? So far, I'd be inclined perhaps to teach &#34;Dolly,&#34; maybe or &#34;In Sight of the Lake.&#34; As a whole, I like the stories but not as much as I expected to. I've always enjoyed Munro's quirky characters and we do get those. And the mundane writ large, and we get that. Still, some just fell flat for me--had I overblown my expectations? Or am I on the money for most readers?
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie and was expecting it to be silly. But, it was too silly to the point of stupid. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this one.
0141331976|5.0|This book was in great shape, just like described.<br />I ordered it as a gift<br />I would recommend it to anyone
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was okay not  the best it was boring and kinda lame dont get  it is the worst one yet
159413586X|5.0|This book was ordered for a christmas family at work.  The girl I drew wanted the whole set and i got it for her.  I read the back of the book and was pulled in.  I had to get this set for myself the most absorbing book series I have ever read
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Such a great game, once I started I couldn't put it down. Story line is engaging and they mix up enough of the actions so it doesn't get frustrating or boribg. Definitely recommend.
0439023521|5.0|Awesome book.  I was sucked in from the first page.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  Definitley recommend all the books by this author
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Lives up to the promotion! Tim Ferris gets the reader outside the box. All three of his books have helped me both professionly and personaly.
1594135851|5.0|fast shipping.  exactly as described.  Makes a wonderful gift for any book lover.  I bought this as a gift for a 16 year old girl.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's s great book and I loved the end in ending<br />  If u are looking to get it GET IT
B008COD5OO|1.0|This was such a lame stupid movie.  Only a mindless person would love something like this. Waste of time and I hate it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting all the way through from beginning to end.<br />I would recommend this book to be read by many people, I think it's appropriate for many age groups.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This was a strange but funny movie.  The kids in it are going to be great actors when they grew up.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think the problem with so many of the negative reviews is just not getting familiar with this app. It works perfectly. I have never had any problems. It does not look or work the same way it does on our laptop or home computer system, but it works sufficiently on my kindle fire. Definitely would recommend others to use this. No complaints whatsoever. Just give yourself a few days before posting an opinion!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|please do not waste your time on this dumb movie.  I wish I had not wasted my time.  I want my life back.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This album is perhaps the best Christmas album I've heard in many moons. The timing is perfect and Rod Stewart is totally into the songs. Orchestration and arrangement are fabulous and the album is brilliantly marketed, with follow up in a TV special on PBS. All in all it's a grand slam!--Bill H.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not entirely challenging, good to pass time, fun to win often, good starter for kids, keeps stats to compare to others
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is a great game; especially on the Kindle Fire. It is cool because it is practically a combination of Angry Birds Space and Angry Birds Seasons, with more characters with powers and looks from the Star Wars movie series. To the people that say that the third world is money: That world is not necessary to buy. As usual, Rovio will come out with a new world for free every month by giving an update. Something that Rovio should improve: Rovio made the Mighty Eagle character weaker and less accurate. If they improved that, this game would get my five stars.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinny`s `The Third Wheel` is one of the greatest books of all time. It`s like I'm living in the stories! Amazing!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked this book because it showed the perspective of a kid going through his freshman year  of high school and finding out who he is. You could see Charlie growing through out this book and I could really relate to him for the most part.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|These remixes of the soundtrack to the movie are even better.  A majority of these songs sit on my grind at work playlist.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This was a gift as my daughter who loved the music and thought it was funny plus all the great actors being silly.
1401227821|5.0|I've been a fan of Adam Hughes for a long long time, I was still in high school when I bought my first issue of Ghost, penciled then when he was lesser known but still amazing. I no longer really read comics, though I do occasionally pick one up when the cover art grabs my attention and I was never too big into DC; this book, even so, is worth every penny.<br />It shows not only a much wider range of covers than I'd thought it would but also manages to capture a lot of his growth as an artist. From the days when he was a bit more generic up until he began to showcase his distinctive and beautiful &#34;good girl&#34; technique.<br />My favorite part of AH is that he manages to convey so much with so little. A lot of artists tend to pack in the detail and while they too tend to have some great work, I'm always amazed by Adam's ability to capture moods and gesture with a few well-placed lines.<br />I have only one complaint and I know that it's invalid. It's not enough! I need more, lol. I realize that this book covers his cover work on the DC universe but I want to see all of it. No doubt we'd end up with a book that would be large enough to ground a 757 and every UPS man would rue the day he was born but oh, I would live in the shadow of their hatred for such a volume.<br />For anyone into comics, Pin-ups, Adam Hughes or just great art; I sincerely recommend this book, even if you're just thinking it might be worth taking a look at, it is, take a look!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This was a gift for my daughter who loves Channing Tatum, it was a sexy movie.  Channing played a good part.
0783226063|1.0|This is one very poorly made movie.  Look at the actors they got and this is all that they did.  McLachlan is horrible like usual.  Read the book and don't bother with this.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I loved the acting and the story, our President and a vampire hunter on the side.  I loved the good defeating bad.  I recommend it, bought an extra as a gift.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|I never liked them before I heard a song from this off pandora and it haunted me to the very core of my soul. I couldn't get it out of my head. After noticing my life was incomplete without this piece of music in my collection I hopped on here in hopes of putting it on my wish list for the holidays, however I noticed it was 4$ and almost did 2 consecutive backflips. I've listened to it an unimaginable amount of times since I bought it 2 days ago. Seriously, just get this album. It's almost stupid not to.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I liked the story, it was lighter that the original series.  It was funny and I recommend seeing this movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of Mario brothers - I enjoy playing this game I give it 5 stars - Leps world 2 is even better!! Better graphics
1451695195|1.0|I've had AMAZING experiences myself, starting weeks before my brother died, and especially minutes after he took his last breath... and I do mean AMAZING, please trust me. They lasted several years and still continue to this day. I also was a skeptic about afterlife until I had these first-hand encounters, and those who witnessed what occurred cannot deny they happened.<br />I am on the last pages of editing my own book I've written about them. And like Dr. Alexander, having those experiences compels us to read, as much as we can, about other people's experiences!<br />I am one who is extremely disappointed in Proof of Heaven.<br />I was mostly BORED with it. Dr. Alexander attempts to reach out to all of us, yet he uses language few people will A, understand and B, care about. I am certainly not uneducated. I have a bit higher than average intelligence, yet I got lost in all the mumbo-jumbo technicality of this book.<br />We hear very little of the actual experience of being on the Other Side because this book is more about Alexander's trying to convince us it happened, and using a very disappointing way of trying to accomplish that.<br />Most people would have no clue what he's talking about nor, again, would they care.<br />He could have given us the technical/medical reasons for why his \\"adventure\\" couldn't possibly be a hoax from a medical standpoint on a mere 2-3 pages. The rest is rambling nonsense.<br />No matter what he says here, I'm going with the fact that lots of drugs were involved and what truly happens to us in coma combined with large amounts of pharmaceuticals, no one, not even the best, most intelligent physician or scientist can explain for certain... they can only give their opinion... and that's what this book is about, Dr. Alexander's opinion. I say don't waste your time.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter who is a Twilight fan, she is probably listrening to it now or soon will be.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was good. I don't look at many movies, so one that I actually finish is normally good.  Most people would enjoy it.  The unrated version has a bit more questionable language than necessary, but not too excessive.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great, great music that you can sing along too. Joyfully passes the time in traffic or at home relaxing. I received it on time and it was well-packaged. It was a great bargain and brought back many memories.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Have you ever thought, &quot;i love Mario, but wish it was so difficult that I would want to hunt the developers down and beat them badly?&quot; if you take your games seriously, just five them the 2.99. They deserve the money, you deserve the hours of frustration.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Read the entire book in less than 24 hours. Can't wait wait for the third third third  .
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent,  I wouldn't have thought I would have enjoyed exploites of someone trapped on mars as much as I did.  It had enough detail to be credible and kept me reading until the last page.  Language wasn't that bad and the story was great.  Take the chance
B004P1JEXE|1.0|Disturbed by the seemingly gratuitous violence against women.  Not planning on reading any more of the series.  A shame because I think it may have been enjoyable otherwise.
B00000DOYF|5.0|One of Genesis best live albums while still at a time when they were still relatively unknown. The creative juices were still flowing and they still were coming off the success of years of hard work as a relatively small band. Of course there is something missing without Gabriel however an excellent live album and one my favourites.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|(Spoiler Warning) Not exactly sure why this is such a highly regarded movie.  It has to be the absolutely weakest in the Nolan franchise.  Like it or not, Bane is one dimensional.  Having read the original debut of Bane in the comics when he first appeared, I have to say not much has changed with Nolan's interpretation.  At least back then he had a little depth, but was never supposed to be a brain surgeon.  I do not understand why one would give someone who is supposed to be a drug-raged brute such a calm and distinguished voice.  In actuality, the voice was the only thing I liked bout the character at all.  Further, Bane is made out to be some evil genius who seems to have absolute control over everyone around him, yet he is \\"fatally\\" taken out with one shot from the Bat-Pod...Really?  That is how you defeat the villain who just spent the entire movie breaking Batman?  Bane = plain boring, 'nuff said.  Next there is Catwoman.  She added nothing to this movie, should never have been in this movie, and is the least interesting of Batman's rogues gallery.  Oh, but that's right, we have to put a pretty girl in a tight outfit into the film for the 13 year old male fans.  Oh joy, Nolan finally introduced us to his interpretation of Robin!  Anyone who didn't see that coming from Blake's first appearance is just an idiot.  I can't stand Robin and despise the very concept of Robin, however, it would have been cool to see him in a pseudo-Nightwing role.  Lastly, Alfred and Fox were way under-utilized.  Genius actors set by the wayside.  Sad.  Oh, did I forget to mention Batman?  That is probably good since he was hardly in this film at all.  That is actually a plus, because Bale plays a much better Bruce Wayne than a Batman.  He is far more intriguing as Wayne and perhaps this is the only thing this film gets right.  It focuses on Bruce Wayne, and tries to move past \\"Batman.\\"  It is because of that modicum of depth that the film earns two stars instead of none.  Overall, itreminded me of Batman Returns...and that is NOT good.
B00008S7KC|4.0|Gives you an idea of Pink Floyd pre-Dark Side, if that's possible. Pink Floyd are perhaps one of the best Live performing bands and that's just their history. No matter who it is in the band the studio may play less of a role than there live performances. This gives you an idea of what they wanted to accomplish without the audience and only gives a glimpse of what they would have really been like in those days.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|what is the problem?  my favorite site and it only loads a few posts !  not worth the bother.... looks like no one is even reading the complaints.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I think that I've read everything Stephen King has written in the past 25 years. This one, although completely outside of the horror genre is, in my opinion, his best yet!
B004BSFC46|4.0|The colouring of these rattles are very nice and quite eye catching. The wings of the butterfly make a nice crinkling sound when touched and it does not take much to get the beetle to rattle. My only complaint is that the label on the betle was appoximately 1 inch in length and was attached to the end of the cloth that wraps around the wrist. As euch it meant that whenever the rattle is worn the label is always sticking out and if baby tries to suck on the beetle the label is immediately thrust into her face. I ended up cutting off mine and i find it to be a lack of fore thought on the design team's behalf
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Fun movie for the whole family! It had plenty of laughs throughout the movie.  It was worth the download. A+
B0042QNP2S|1.0|We chose this model for my son because he's really into opening the hoods on cars and truck and seeing the engine, working on the engine, etc.  The description says \\"The cab has folding mirrors and tilts forward to display the detailed engine.\\", but the cab doesn't tilt forward.  I found a youtube video of a kid playing with Bruder garbage truck that look a lot like this one and the cab tilts forward as described.  The one on youtube is slightly different because it has exhaust pipes coming up the back of the cab and the one we have doesn't.  But everything else looks very close.  The description appears to be wrong for this.

B009AMAMF2|5.0|Just like Branded and The Hunger Games before I had never heard of Cloud Atlas until I saw the trailer. I just wasn't on my radar, but then I saw the extended trailer three months ago and I was blown away by it. The scope and size of the film was astonishing and the unique themed story was really interesting. It also helped that the trailer had amazing music with it. Then there was the great cast with Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Keith David, Halle Barry, Hugh Grand and more. After seeing all that in the extended trailer I was hooked and Cloud Atlas was a must see film for me. Yet even after I saw the trailer I didn't know it was based off a book with the same name and authored by David Mitchell. I didn't figure that out till a few weeks later and finally picked up the novel about two weeks ago. I am just about done with it and the novel is really well written with a great set of stories that interweave characters and themes as everything is connected. I remember reading online that the author David Mitchell said that his novel was un-filmable, and I think I'm going to have to agree with him. The six different stories, the books massive scope and range of characters I really don't see how the Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer could manage it and as it got closer and reviews came out they weren't glowing. Sure in general the film has gotten pretty good reviews but nothing glowing. Did that stop me from going to see the film hell no. Generally I don't listen to reviewers though when I went to the mid-day showing I toned down my anticipation of the film deciding not to get my hopes up. Did I enjoy the film is it any good? Keep reading to find out.<br /><br />Coming out of the theater I would have to say that no it wasn't a great film. Coming out of the theater I think I would have given it 3.5 to 4 stars, but as I made my way home and began to think about the film the more I began to love the film. That rarely happens for me. When I leave the theater and think about a filmI rarely like it more and more in fact usually my rating will go down a little bit or stand pat. Cloud Atlas is a wonderfully beautiful messy film. All right let's take a look at what was truly great about this film.<br /><br />Cinematography (A): The film was beautifully made from Scotland to Germany the United States, Majorca and Hong Kong. The cinematographer and the camera men did an excellent job of capturing the beauty of the places they were filming whether it be from Düsseldorf and Glasgow, Scotland to Majorca Island (Which I had no idea existed until I stayed through the credits) to Hong Kong everything was filmed perfectly. The film should be nominated for an Oscar for this.<br /><br />Makeup/Costumes (A): I never talk about this in my reviews. I might passingly talk about it, but never really call it out, but the makeup and costume work was brilliantly done for this film. The characters had to play multiple characters in different times and different sexes and I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it really did. In certain times I didn't recognize Tom Hanks until I looked closely at the character. It shows how good an actor he which I'll get to in a little bit. Hugo Weaving played a woman head nurse at an old folk's home and he was almost completely unrecognizable at first. If there are two categories this film should win an Oscar in it should be for Costume Design and Best Makeup.<br /><br />Special Effects (A): The special effects were excellent, but we should expect that from a Wachowski directed and produced film. I've bashed on their directorial ability many times, but the siblings certainly know how to bring special effects into a film especially in Nea So Copros the city of the distant future. It was brought to life wonderfully as it was richly detailed. I forget all the names of the companies that helped bring this world and the rest of the film to life, but I believe ILM helped as did a company called RISE. Another category the film should be nominated for.<br /><br />Music (A): I loved the music in the trailers and the music in the film was remarkable as it also played an important part in the score. The score was done by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer. Tykwer also directed part of the film. I don't think I remember hearing to much about these men, but if I remember correctly Heil has mainly done music for television. The tone and pace of the music fit the film perfectly and was simply beautiful. I'm going to have to download or go out and buy the score for this film and it definitely should be nominated for original score heck I might even take this over The Dark Knight Rises score which I also loved.<br /><br />Acting (B+): The acting by the cast was extremely good as I mention Tom Hanks great job with his roles. I'm not going to mention them all it would take too much time and space. One of my favorite roles is Henry Goose a doctor in 1850 who slowly poisons Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) to get to his gold he has in a chest. Of course Hugo Weaving plays a bad guy in every role whether it be from an evil father in law or a nurse or to what I assume is some kind of police captain in Nea So Copros. What I really need to talk about are some of the actors and actresses who I didn't recognize and I think most Americans wouldn't recognize and in many parts stole the film. First there is Bae Doona. She is a South Korean actress who I don't think as acted in an American film before and she did an outstanding job. She played three characters, but the one that stood out was her role as Sonmi-451. I mean if there was one character that stood above the rest it was Sonmi. She was the most compelling of all of the characters as an engineered worker of the future, and Bae Donna captured the performance perfectly. Another actor I had never heard of before was James D'Arcy an English actor along with his fellow actor Jim Sturgess. Sturgess was also out the most standout performances besides Bae Donna. His two best performances and roles were Adam Ewing and Hae-Joo Chang. Yes he played an Asian character of the distant future and performed it well. Yes the acting in general was performed extremely well, but two actors seemed out of place, miscast or something else I can't quiet put my finger on. Those two are Susan Sarandon and Keith David. I love the actor Keith David he's a good actor who's been in many films I've enjoyed but he and Susan seemed to have just been sleepwalking through the film being overshadowed by all the other actors.<br /><br />Story (B+): I think this is what most people will have a problem with in this film is the story or better yet pacing of the film and how it was put together. The way the film bounced back and forth in time might have confused a lot of people. It wasn't a problem for me, but I can definitely see where people would have a problem with it. Most of the stories were well done, but there was one I had a problem with and that was the story called Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After which takes place in a post apoplectic world after the fall of civilization. It wasn't one thing that turned me off to this story it was a few things from the futuristic language I could barely understand and the plot that wasn't well flushed out it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />Directing (B): This is what I had the biggest problem with in the film was the directing and editing of the film. I know they wanted to show how our lives overlapped and our choices in the past affect our choices in the future, but the bouncing around in time wasn't always the best and I'm sure will confuse people. I personally enjoyed it and think it worked better than having it be linear going from the past to the future. Then there is the editing the directors did which also wasn't great. I'm sure this film was originally more than three hours long and had to be edited out and blended together with each director directing one part of the film and it wasn't perfectly put together. As for the directors and the directing of the film it was well done. I know I've bashed the Wachowski siblings on the directing ability. After their great success of the Matrix they did the very disappointing and needless sequels and then the bad Speed Racer. The siblings like to go over the top and be grandiose, but they did a good job with the futurist world and their directing as did Tom Tykwer. As I said I had never heard of the German filmmaker before, but he did an excellent job directing primarily the scenes in the past. This was a very ambitious undertaking for the directors, producer and studio and I think it paid off well.<br /><br />Author David Mitchell had said his novel couldn't be translated into film and after reading the novel I had agreed with him, but we were both wrong. Was the film a perfect translation no, but what novel is. Anyone who expects a perfect translation of a novel to film will be disappointed. Cloud Atlas is beautiful and ambitious film with excellent cinematography, makeup/costume design and special effects/action along great acting and story, and good directing. From what I've seen from other reviews no one hates the film. In fact I don't think I've seen a bad review. Most of the reviews say it's an average to amazing film depending on how well the story and characters captivate you, and they did for me. I highly recommend this film and the novel as well I don't think anyone will be disappointed.

B0037ODTIQ|4.0|What comes to mind when you think of World War II films. The Bridge on the River Kwai, Stalag 17, Saving Private Ryan, The Guns of Navarone, The Great Escape or maybe Kelly's Hero's, but have you heard of A Bridge Too Far? I don't think too many have from the amount of ratings for it I've found online. A Bridge Too Far is a little known and perhaps overlooked World War II film. To be honest I had never seen the film or heard of it until Memorial Day in I think 1995. TNT always aired a marathon of World War II films during that weekend. I'm not sure if they do that still. Anyway I loved the old war films and usually watched a lot of them and in doing so I came across this film. I had never heard of it before and when I saw it at the time I really liked it, and a few years ago I ended up buy the DVD and I don't think I watched it until this past Sunday afternoon. A Bridge Too Far is a really good film, but suffers from a major flaw.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know A Bridge Too Far is based off a book with the same name by author Cornelius Ryan and actually happened in World War II. It was called Operation Market Garden. Field Marshal Montgomery wanted to force his way into Germany over the River Rhine and wanted to circ*mvent the German front and that was to cease three bridges that would allow the Allies to encircle Germany's industrial heart. It was a joint operation with the British, Dutch, Polish and the Dutch resistance. It was a bold move as they tried to take the bridges quickly. Bombers would parachute troops to the two furthest bridges and their task was to take and hold the bridges while ground forces took the first bridge and then moved on to reinforce the men holding the other two bridges. Things went relatively smoothly for Gen. Horrock and his men as he took the Eindhoven and Nijmegen bridges, but was delayed by heavy resistance, the demolition of a smaller bridge and stretched supply lines. In Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division who weresupposed to take and secure the bridge encountered massive German resistance and with no help from ground forces were overrun and captured by the Germans. It failed for a few reasons. One which is kind of ironic with the massive bombings before and right after D Day the allies had taken out much of the railway that brought in supplies from the coasts and France, and without that the allies in Germany had to rely on Truck and transport which could be fooled by the Germans by switching the sign posts. Also Allied intelligence had overestimated the impact they had on the German army believing they had scattered them as the Allies would learn again at the Battle of the Bulge. The film follows the actual events real closely and I have to give the writers, director and producers credit they didn't change much. Of course I think that is part of the problem with the film. The film is hurt by the passing. It is nearly three hours long, but isn't enough time to focus on each bridge the battles or the characters and the all-star cast. I think the film with the scope they were trying to achieve would have worked better on a TV miniseries or if it focused on just on the bridge in Arnhem and the British 1st Airborne Division. I think the film would have worked better than it did.<br /><br />Speaking of the all-star cast it was loaded with stars at the time and future stars that included Edward Fox as Lt. Gen. Brian Horrocks. He's starred in Battle of Britain, Gandhi, Force 10 from Navarone and my personal favorite of his The Day of the Jackal. The good film not the crappy Bruce Willis film that came out back in 1996 I think. It also starred Robert Redford and Anthony Hopkins along with Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, James Caan and Sean Connery. The cast is great and the acting as well. It's just that with scenes bouncing back and forth from one city and bridge to another you just don't get to know or care about the characters you're watching. As I said above I think if the film focused only on Arnhem where things went wrong, and the British 1st Airborne Division that includes Lt. Col. John Frost (Anthony Hopkins) and their struggle to take and hold the bridge would made a much better film.<br /><br />The action in the film was really well done with intensity, with especially in Arnhem as the Germans resisted and counter attacked. There were no great special effects for the film as they used many WWII planes and vehicles for the film along with over a thousand men for extras to jump out of the planes and pose as extra soldiers. The budget was expensive for the time at I think somewhere around 24 million and what is remarkable if I remember correctly the all-star actors agreed to take the same amount of money. That's unheard of today some stars willing to take a major pay cut to get a film done yet these actors did. This was Richard Attenborough third film and you could tell. The pacing and editing wasn't the best as he moved the film to one film to the next. Though he would go on to make some really good films in Gandhi, Shadowlands and Chaplin.<br /><br />Is A Bridge Too Far in the upper tier of war films no it's not. It suffers from an overstretched story and plot that takes away from the characters and turns into more of a doc*mentary then an actual war film. Still with that said the film is still good, with great production value, acting, story (Yes I know the story both helps and hurts the film.) and action. If you find it on Netflix or a video store I highly recommend it. It's worth a viewing to learn about the failed operation in WWII and to see a pretty good World War II film and here I wasn't going to review anything until Cloud Atlas.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Why does Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace receive so much undeserved venom from fans I don't understand. When I heard that George Lucas was making the prequel in the mid-1990's I was so excited. As I said in my three previous Star Wars reviews I loved the flawed Star Wars films and the universe it created, and I highly anticipated The Phantom Menace. At the time I didn't know too much about the cast. Liam Neeson was probably the biggest name I recognized. He was great in the underrated Darkman film. Then there is Schindler's List the film and his performance should speak for themselves, and finally Rob Roy which I saw with my mother and which I think is an unappreciated film. I had didn't know much about Ewan McGregor at the time or his best known film at the time Trainspotting. The only film had seen him in was Nightwatch which is a good thriller. When the film came out I rushed to see it, and loved it. I ended up seeing it 24 times in Alexandria, VA and here in Portland, OR loving it every time. It has its flaws with its biggest being Jar Jar Binks, but those small flaws don't take away from the really good Star Wars film<br /><br />Everyone should know the plot of this film, so instead I'll talk about some of the complaints people had of the plot and my thoughts of the plot. The biggest outcry by fans and critics is the character Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). They cry and wine that the character is added nothing to the story, was annoying and just a merchandising tool. First off yes I agree Jar Jar was annoying, could they have toned him down a bit yes, but he was no more annoying than R2-D2 and C-3PO or the Ewoks, but he is important to the plot of the films as a third string character. Finally he wasn't only added for a merchandising tool. I think people judge him way too harshly and rate the film lower because of the character. Sometimes that is the only complaint I hear from fans who hate the film and Lucas is the name Jar Jar Binks, and do you know what I tellthem that they aren't true Star Wars fans then. Another complaint is the introduction of midi-chlorians. That I thought really wasn't necessary and took a little bit away from the spirituality of the force. Perhaps the biggest personal complaint I had was they killed off Darth Maul. Just like Boba Fett I loved the character and wish they could have used him in the sequels instead of Count Dooku or maybe they could have found a way to use both of them. The story on a whole was really good with Lucas show us his superb writing ability as he introduced us to classic characters from the original films in Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid who would become the future emperor) along with introducing us great new characters in Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), Padm&eacute; Amidala (Natalie Portman), Darth Maul (Ray Park) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). Lucas has an amazing way of writing and developing stories and characters, and he does a great but not perfect job with the Phantom Menace.<br /><br />The acting job by the entire cast was excellent with Ewan McGregor stealing the show. He did a masterful job playing a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The beautiful Natalie Portman also had a good performance as Padme, and would give even better performances in the sequels. At the time I didn't remember her being the kid in The Professional or Al Pacino's step-daughter in heat. She really had both beauty and brains which shows in all her acting performances. Ray Park was awesome as Darth Maul and so was Samuel L. Jackson. His character Mac Windo is another character I've come to love. Samuel brought his coolness and awesomeness to the role, and it was great. Just like the originals Frank Oz did an outstanding role as Yoda's voice. Of course Liam Neeson did a great job as the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn. He displayed his emotion's beautifully from humor and banter with Obi-Wan and his believe in Anakin. Jake Lloyd did a decent but not great job as Anakin, though I wish George had found a better child actor for the role. On a side note I didn't know even till right before I did this review that Keira Knightley played Sabe (Padme's double).<br /><br />The effects done by ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) were of course outstanding. Everything from the CGI characters to the droid army was done really well. The action was really good, but not great with the climatic lightsaber battle stealing the show. My brother along with some others have said that they thing the lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was better than the one in Star Wars III: The Revenge of the Sith between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. They were both outstanding, but I prefer the lightsaber battle in The Revenge of the Sith. I thought it was better and more intense, and maybe it was better because of the emotional impact. Still the lightsaber battle in The Phantom Menace was great and again Darth Maul is awesome.<br /><br />The directorial job by George Lucas was good, but not great again proving his detractors wrong. Is he a masterful director no, but he does a good job with actors and story along with the effects. As you would suspect John Williams was great. His score throughout the film was brilliant culminating in the outstanding climatic score that brought to life the lightsaber battle and the battle in general perfectly.<br /><br />There is no reason for the hatred The Phantom Menace or the rest of the prequels receive. It kind of reminds me of the venom pathetic fans spew about Mass Effect 3. Whining and bitching about the endings which were flawed but still good. They expect that the ending should be done the way they want them to be. Demanding that the ending be change and it worked which is a sad day for video game makers and artists in general. Just because you hate a character doesn't make the film bad. Get over yourselves. Was Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace a perfect or excellent film no, but overall it was a great film with a good story, great characters/acting, beautiful special effects, pretty good directing and excellent music. Overall a rating of 4.5 and the 3rd best Star Wars film.
B006T3RM08|5.0|After reading all the bad reviews, I was very relieved when mine worked flawlessly. I would highly recommend this product.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|You would think I couldn't like a romantic comedy that celebrates the Philadelphia Eagles and has dancing. That's a bad combination for me. I grew up in the Washington D.C. area and spent over half my life in the area watching and rooting for the Redskins through the 1980's and on winning three super bowls with great players like Gary Clark, Monte Coleman, Art Monk, Darrell Green, Charles Mann, Brian Mitchell, Mark Rypien and Ricky Sanders. I along with our family grew up hating the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. It's ingrained on our brains, and to be honest they suck. Any way it makes it harder for me to enjoy films that revolve around these teams, and then the romantic comedy factor. I'm not a big fan of the genre. Sure I've enjoyed some like Wimbledon, The Princess Bride, Pretty Woman and Sweet Home Alabama, but in general the genre sucks. I know the films are primarily made for women, but in most there is no chemistry between the leads, which makes the romance unbelievable. There is also usually the lack of character growth or predictable characters and in general the predictability of the genre. You know how it's going to end so the journey is the most important thing and if it isn't believable or the characters aren't likeable, compelling or you have a reason to root for the film fails. You would think with these two things going against Silver Linings that I wouldn't like it, but I did. I truly loved the Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />First off of course the film is predictable. You know how it's most likely going to end from the trailer, but it's the journey getting there is what truly makes this film so good. The film is adapted from novel with the same name and by the author Matthew Quick. The story follows Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who's in a mental health institution in Baltimore after he loses everything in his life. His wife Nikki cheats on him with a fellow cheater from his school and he nearly beats the man to death. Pat loses his job, home, has a restraining order taken out by his wife, finds out that he is bipolar and ends up in a mental institution. The emotionally unstable Pat is taken out by his mother Dolores Solitano (Jacki Weaver) and brought home to Philadelphia where he'll live with his die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and bookie Pat Solitano Sr. (Robert De Niro). Arriving home Pat stops taking his pills and is determined to better his life, because he believes that if he does so Nikki will take him back even though his family and friends doubt that will happen. Hopping to get in contact with Nikki he goes to dinner with his friends Ronnie (John Ortiz) and Veronica (Julia Stiles) home where he meets Veronica's sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and had a break down as well going into deep depression. Almost instantly the two form a connection though Pat doesn't want to see it. The two scarred and emotionally unstable characters deal with their deep issues, their families as they form a bond helping each other and find a silver lining in their screwed up lives. I think that's all I'll talk about plot wise. As for the two main characters their believable and genuine and I had empathy and understood some of what they are going through. About twelve years ago I was put in a mental hospital for a short period of time and suffered from deep depression resulting in me taking pills. In fact I still suffer from occasional depression that that I take a pills for along with pills for blood pressure and I know what they can do to you and finding a silver lining in my at the time in my screwed up life. It can be anything or anyone like finding a friend or just dancing like Pat and Veronica do in the film as long as you find something that gives you hope. The characters are believable and real chemistry and as the film goes on you become invested in these characters and truly root from them to get together. The story and film even brought some tears to my eyes and I'm guy, and that rarely happens especially in romantic comedies, but this film is moving. Now as for the comedy is more muted and not over the top nor is it forced. It's believable and you actually think the characters would say what they do and it really works as I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I think it has more in common with a romantic drama that has humorous moments.<br /><br />The small role Chris Tucker has in the film as Danny a friend of Pat's from the mental institution is Tucker's best acting performance to date. Sure he's not a great actor mainly doing comedy, but here he's not comedic side kick and actually shows more of his dramatic acting ability with his toned down comedy. Robert De Niro hasn't been at the top of his game over the last decade with performances in Killer Elite, Hide and Seek, Righteous Kill and Godsend, but he is still a good and capable actor. Is Pat Sr. the best character he's played no or is the character a little lacking yes, but De Niro brings the character to life and the emotional weight as Pat Sr. tries to connect to his son that he hasn't always been there for. John Ortiz does a good job as Ronnie, Pats good friend who tries to help Pat even though he's slowly suffocating in his own life. Obviously the film belongs to Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I'm not the biggest fan of Bradley Cooper or his acting ability. The only film I truly liked him in was Limitless. He showed off his acting ability which he puts on display in Silver Linings. He brings emotional depth to Pat and his struggles with accepting his Bipolar, deals with family issues and falls in love with Tiffany. For me Jennifer Lawrence is the star. I first noticed Jennifer, and her beauty in her supporting role in X-Men: First Class. I fell in love with her and her acting ability after seeing the Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games showing she could hold a film basically all by herself. She embodies Tiffany and truly brings the character to life showing of her acting range and ability. Jennifer should be nominator for an Oscar for her roles in The Hunger Games and Silver Linings. To be honest I think she should be nominated twice though that is by love and bias for the young actress. The only actress and character who I thought didn't work or was missed cast was Julia Stiles as Veronica. Julia just didn't look like she was emotionally there throughout her scenes in the film. Thank fully she was a sub-supporting actress and had only a limited number of scenes that didn't affect the film.<br /><br />I sure did love the film Three Kings. It's a great and underrated war film about post war Iraq after the first Gulf War with a really good story and good performances by George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg. Until I saw Silver Linings Playbook, Three Kings was my favorite David O. Russell film. Though to be honest it's the only film of his I've seen. No I still haven't seen The Fighter and don't know when I will. In Silver Linings he again shows his ability as a writer and director bringing together the moving story and actors to make one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've seen. I'm not a big fan of Danny Elfman who performed the score with many of his scores sounding the same never bringing live to the films he does scores for, but he does a good job with the different moods and tones of the film helping to bring to the film to life.<br /><br />I survived a genre I don't really like and film that surrounds itself with a team I hate and came out loving the film. Silver Lining is a nearly perfect film with great chemistry between the lead characters and actors with a believable story, great directing, music and it's only small flaw is with a few of its supporting cast. I know some people may have a different opinion and may not like it as much as I do, but in my opinion Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. The film deserves all the Oscarpraise it's been getting and I hope it gets at very least nominations for best director, actor and actress. I loved the film and highly recommend it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The soundtrack expresses all of the emotion that is suppose to be in Les Miserables.  The classic songs are delivered in a way that puts you there in the moment with the actor rather than being in a studio listening to pretty music.  The only song missing is Do You Hear The People Sing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|James Bond is sure getting up there in age. He's 59 years old since his birth in Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royal along with 50 years since his first film appearance in Dr. No, and his 21 other Bond films have taken a toll on the franchise and character with its ups and down. It might be time for Bond to retire and get his AARP card. I started watching Bond back in 1990 or 1991. I was just 11 or 12 years old when I caught a marathon of Bond films on what I remember being TBS and the first Bond film I saw was Goldfinger. I didn't understand all the sexual references or the adult humor at the time, but I loved the films and character, and they were really entertaining. My favorite Bond is Sean Connery. His first four film go at the character with Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball were just great. That's not to say he was perfect especially with his second and third go at the character. I think George Lazenby is looked over or unappreciated as James Bond. Roger Moore in the beginning did a really good job as James Bond, but quickly started showing his age after the disaster of a Bond film in Moonraker. Moore was followed by Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and now Daniel Craig as James Bond which comes back to the age thing. Through the years with different actors and different tone or takes on the character James Bond has gotten old. Some would say why continue the series the character is outdated with it being a different type of world and films like the Bourne series, Mission Impossible and others maybe it is time to retire the character and series. The funny thing is Skyfall addresses these issues and masterfully does it with poignant and humorous moments that address these issues.<br /><br />I think I'll try and avoid plot details and instead talk about some of the themes of the film like for example intelligence agencies in the modern world. With countries not being a huge direct threat to nation security of nations with most being criminalorganizations, militant groups or terrorist organizations intelligence agencies have to adapt and is an issue in this film dealing with MI6. Of course getting old and being in this line of work is another theme. What is a person like Bond going to do if he retires? I mean really is he just going to sit around somewhere leading a boring life. The man has lived an exciting with women, danger and adventure, but not without being majorly scarred from torture, injuries and losing friends and loved ones. M (Judi Dench) also has to face these realities as does the bad guy Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). The last issue is the abandonment and mommy issue which two of the main characters have. It doesn't sound like a Bond film does it? I'm sure some would say it goes against the Bond reality, but face it time, age and the sins we commit in life eventually catch up to us and it works in Skyfall making it one of the best Bond films. There are a few flaws in the film mainly I think to do with editing for time. I think Sam Mendes and the editors edited out a few things to save on time. I think you'll notice them like when Bond is relaxing on a beach somewhere. I won't give anything away except it's kind of really short and seems to have been edited. Also there's character Sévérine (Bérénice Lim Marlohe). The stunningly beautiful character/actress is underused and I think some of her scenes were edited out or shortened. These are just small flaws that I noticed, but nothing that would hurt the film for me or anyone else.<br /><br />All right let me be honest what makes this film go are two actors and one actress in Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench, and really the film is about them. Daniel Craig with his performance as James Bond has become my second favorite Bond behind Sean Connery. I know people will point to Quantum of Solace saying how disappointing a film it was, but it wasn't. Was it perfect of course not, but it is not even close to being the worst Bond film. Ifyou want those all you have to do is watch Moonraker, Never Say Never Again, Die Another Day and The World Is Not Enough. Quantum was middle of the pack Bond film and Daniel Craig did a great job. Judi Dench as M in GoldenEye from just being Bond's boss into a real character with obvious flaws and scars and true affection and respect for James and she truly shows it here in Skyfall. Then there is Javier Bardem who truly steals the film as the bad guy. I think this may be the most original villain in the Bond franchise though some might find some parallels with another Bond villain, but I won't tell you since that might give something away. Even with that said Javier does the far better job. He's been betrayed, abandoned, tortured and has been psychologically scarred. He isn't after world domination or something ridiculous like that he's after something more tangible. I might have to watch the Bond films again, but in my opinion Raoul Silva might be the best single Bond villain ever. Ralph Fiennes does a really good job in his role as Gareth Mallory, and I loved Ben Whishaw as the new Q. I look forward to seeing the character in future films. I've already talked about Bérénice Lim Marlohe, so instead I'll talk briefly about Naomie Harris (Eve). She's not horrible nor is she greatly memorable. I ended up with a sort of indifference toward her and her character.<br /><br />The more realistic action they've been putting in Bond films since Daniel Craig began as James Bond again really works. The opening sequence is really good and there's a short sequence at night in a skyscraper in Shanghai that is truly beautifully done. The cinematography was beautiful especially the scenes in Scotland. In the brief scenes they did an astounding job showing off the beauty of the country. Sam Mendes is a masterful job directing Skyfall and beginning together the story and actors almost perfectly. Now to be honest up until about nine months to a year ago I had never heard of Adele,and nor was I a big fan when I heard her music. That being said she did a really good job with the Bond theme song. It is kind of funny and interesting that Bond is the only franchise that does something like this and generally it works. The problem I had with Skyfall's one isn't the song it's the video that went with it. The video just wasn't very good at least to me. Outside of the Adele and the Bond theme the music was well done and worked for the film.<br /><br />Is James Bond getting old or irrelevant? Yes maybe the Ian Fleming character he created in his novels, but not the James Bond you saw in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. No James Bond has found a way to adapt and cope with the times yet still keep many of the qualities and beliefs that have made him a great character and in doing so he has for now become ageless. Skyfall is one of Bond's best films with a great story, great acting (especially by the three main characters), really good directing and cinematography. I highly recommend this film for Bond fans and action fans in general. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000002MY3|5.0|Growing up in the 1990s, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was one of those albums that one simply could not escape, even if you wanted too. Not that I did want too, though.  Out of nowhere, this Canadian blows up the charts with the vehement wrath of \\"You Oughta Know\\", and we were all left shaking our head going \\"Who the hell was that?\\" Of course, although \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is her international debut, she had two albums before this (the 1991 \\"Alanis\\" and the 1992 \\"Now is the Time\\") and a demo single (the 1987 \\"Fate Stay With Me/Find the Right Man\\"). These two albums were significant sellers in Canada, but most people outside Canada had never heard of her until \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".<br /><br />Looking back on my life, there are several years that have been explicitly defined in my memory by the music of that time.  The three big albums of 1994/1995 were \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", Bush's \\"Sixteen Stone\\", and No Doubt's \\"Tragic Kingdom\\".  Although obviously not a conceptual trilogy by any means, as they are from different artists, I think these three albums give a clear snapshot of what was happening in music at the time, even if \\"Sixteen Stone\\" is little more than a copy and lift of Nirvana's trademark sound and is pretty much grunge by numbers.  Still, I find it eerily appropriate that Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani ended up married.<br /><br />In a way, I can't help but think Morisette, like Bob Dylan, was something of a product of her time. By the mid 1990s, alternative/grunge was going strong (although signs of the impending self-implosion were already grossly evident), and the \\"women in rock\\" movement was bludgeoning away any possible male domination. Likewise, I don't think Dylan would have had the massive impact that he did initially had he started in any other decade besides the 1960s.<br /><br />\\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is very much an early adult/late teenager album. Alanis hits on so many themes - bad parent relationships (\\"Perfect\\"), the meaning of religion (specifically Catholicism) (\\"Forgiven\\"), the heady froth of new love (\\"Head Over Heels\\"), coming to terms with who you are and learning about life (\\"You Learn\\"), and the roles of gender relationships and clearly defining who you are in relation to your lover (\\"Not the Doctor\\"). One song \\"Ironic\\" literally plays out as though a high school student or young college student in a beginning English class wrote a poem about so called \\"irony\\".<br /><br />Naturally, there are also plenty of angst and pure, unadulterated anger at an unnamed lover who spurned a young Alanis. Although she has never revealed who this person is, this sexual relationship she had with this older man, as well as the aftermath of the dissolution of this relationship, surfaces again and again on not only \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" but through several subsequent albums. Her anger is so real and vital that it becomes the principal driving force behind the album, and each song is informed by her wanting to come to terms with her life.<br /><br />One of the most interesting facets of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is just how successful Alanis was. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is the biggest selling debut by a woman, and yet, listening to the record, you can't help but be a little surprised that so many people connected to this music in such a grandios way. I don't mean that as a slight, just an observation. The music is highly insular. When you listen to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", it's almost like you are listening to highly personal diary entries that just happen to be set to music. The lyrics are largely emotional cartharis to the pain that Alanis has gone through in a highly personal, unique setting. Yet so many people were able to relate to Alanis.<br /><br />Alanis said of her 2012 album, \\"Havoc and Bright Lights\\", that \\"a song starts with the seed, or the essence of an idea. I far prefer writing about the personal and the micro in a concise way. That's what interests me. Rather than paint overly broad strokes, I'd rather write about the one-on-one of personal interactions. And then allow it to be a commentary on the more macro effects we see in the world, from there.\\"<br /><br />And that, I feel, is what makes \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" such a unique success story in the annals of rock. Her vocals are unconventional and rather cauterwalling at times and her lyrics literally read like straight diary entries which haven't been edited, and yet the music is so relatable. Perhaps people have taken Alanis's descriptions of highly personal situations and were able to relate them to their own situations.  I remember back in the 1990s my best friend's girlfriend's friend would always tease the girl friend about my best friend taking a long hard look at her ass and then playing golf for a while, because that's exactly what he did.<br /><br />Like I wrote in my review of \\"Havoc and Bright Lights\\", each record that Alanis has released is an aural snapshot of her life at the time. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is very much an exploration of the life of a young woman's psyche. Although some of the lyrics feel amateurish and some of the emotions rather everyday and plain, that has more to do with being young an inexperienced. Perhaps it is this exploration that caught on for so many other people.<br /><br />Even though the album is insular and can be rather jarring with Alanis's octave-wailing theatrics, like any good artist, Alanis's genius is taking something intensely personable and making that experience broadly relatable.  Sometimes there is no explaining success.  On her subsequent albums, Alanis's music has become more and more like short chapters from self-help books rather than the naked emotional catharis of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  For my money, although I've heard all her records, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" has always been the most interesting for that very reason.<br /><br />Yet even on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", you see Alanis searching for meaning and a way out of the emotional and spiritual traps laid before her, and by the time we get to \\"Havoc and Bright Lights\\" we see that she has largely succeeded.  The roots to all the various trajectories and detours her music has taken over the years can largely be found right here on this album.<br /><br />Overall a great album from the mid 1990s.  Make sure to pick this one up if you like that era of music, along with the other two parts of my own loosely defined mid 1990s trilogy,  \\"Sixteen Stone\\" and \\"Tragic Kingdom\\"!!
B009MF56GC|2.0|When I first heard of The Expendables film back in 2009 I was excited, and what man who grew up in the 1980's and 1990's. Sylvester Stallone was making a hall of fame and all-star action film that brought together himself along with Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Gary Daniels to name a few. You had action stars from the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's all in the same film. It seemed like a good and fun idea and I thought it would be a great action film. I went to see it when it first came out and leaving the theater I was disappointed. It was at best an action film, and it suffered at The Avengers suffered from. It's a great concept to bring together larger than life action or superheroes, but once you get by the excitement of seeing all your favorite action stars or superheroes in the same film you begin to see the flaw that are plainly there to see. The Avengers had them, but nowhere near as bad as The Expendables. For that reason I when I heard that there was going to be a sequel I wasn't excited. I was interested and paid attention to the news about the film, but I wasn't going to pay ten dollars or more for what I thought was going to be an average action film at best, and after seeing The Expendables 2 recently I was right not to waste my money.<br /><br />The Expendables 2 is much worse than the original. In fact after I watched the film and gave it time the worse my opinion of the film grew. The Expendables overall plot is about them trying to stop a cache of plutonium which Jean Claude Van-Damn is after. Yes I'm not even going to use their character names, because they aren't any characters in this film. I mean who cares about this men whether they live or die, or if you can understand them. Take the first opening action scene I couldn't understand a word they anyone was saying except the curse words, and maybe that's all that they were saying which also led to about a fourth of dialogue to be completely unrecognizable. Next they brought characters in and out of the film for real no reason except to show off as many action stars as possible while being detrimental to the film. For example Jet Li is a great action star, but they got rid of him with in the first ten minutes and introduced us Liam Hemsworth who I believe played Billy a sniper. On a side note Liam really needs to ask his brother Chris for some help with roles. I know he'll get more time in the sequel, but he had like two lines in The Hunger Games and he's just a throw away character that Stallone and the director Simon West try to make us care about. I mean they introduce him he shows off his ability as a sniper, talks about leaving to be with his girlfriend even though they don't we have no connection to the character or care what happens to him, and then he's killed off about ten to fifteen minutes after Li disappears from the film. Oh yes I forgot in the beginning of the film Stallone and his team go rescue some billionaire and end rescuing Arnold Schwarzenegger who is there for some convenient reason to say some funny dialogue and then vanishes. I know I know defenders of this film will say the action films are generally ridiculous and over the top, but The Expendables 2 is laughably ridiculous only in bad way. Most and good action films have a coherent plot and the viewer actually comes to care about the main character or character. The Expendables has turned into the action version of the Ocean films which is basically the same premise bringing together great actors, but studios, directors and even the stars need to realize that bringing together these stars may mean big bucks, but it doesn't mean the film will actually be good. This is turning into a long paragraph. I would talk about the acting, but honestly there is no good acting in this film. During the film Chuck Norris miraculously shows up for some convoluted and convenient reason and saves Stallone's team and then gives some reason about being a lone wolf anddisappears again. There really isn't any reason to care about the story or the characters. To be honest each of these action stars films are better than The Expendables 2.<br /><br />All right enough about the bad plot, non-existent characters or the ridiculous dialogue, and let's move on to the action, which is supposed to be the bread and butter of this growing franchise. I have seen a lot of good action films recently in Skyfall, El Gringo, Dredd and Looper. I know I know again defenders of this film will say action films are supposed to be over the top. Yes if it makes sense like for example the Die Hard films. Sure there was some unbelievable action scenes, but they weren't outrageously over the top like in The Expendables films. Directors and actors should know sometimes less is better than more over the top action. Having so many action stars in the film makes the scenes unmemorable and unremarkable. Stallone has plane with a cannon in its nose and he crashes it into a mine, so what and who cares. They climax is in an airport with a hundred unknown or indefinable bad guys while the good guys just shoot their guns and spout some ridiculous dialogue. The action and fight scenes have no meaning and aren't entertaining in anyway.<br /><br />On paper the idea of the Ocean and The Expendables films is a good idea, but as it's put together things quickly fall apart with too many characters to care about, an average to bad plot, bad dialogue and average to bad action or drama, and that is what both of these franchised suffered from and to a lesser extend The Avengers. Like I said once you get over the excitement of seeing all these famous actors, action stars or superheroes together you see the flaws in the film. Overall The Expendables 2 is a bad action film which has limited value in seeing all these action stars together and a few funny lines.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|First off, let's get the technical Blu-Ray stuff out of the way.  Warner Brothers have released some truly lackluster editions of the \\"Vacation\\" series, and unfortunately \\"Christmas Vacation\\" is no exception.  The \\"Ultimate Edition\\" Blu-Ray copy released in 2009  featuring the newer, green jewel case is the exact same copy (with only the blue color case changed) that Warner Bros. released in 2006.<br /><br />The picture quality never really becomes alive like you would expect from a Blu-ray, and is rather drab to say the last.  The 1.85:1 non-anamorphic print is about the same as the Special Edition, and there isn't the same amount of crispness and clarity that should be present for a high definition transfer.  Several sequences suffer from some rather dark video, and the audio is the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stero track from the original DVD releases.  Subtitles and mono tracks are available in French and Spanish.<br /><br />Special features include a full length audio commentary by Jeremiah Chechik (director), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Katherine), Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), and producer Matty Simmons.  Notably absence is Chevy Chase.  The commentary isn't that revelatory but is passable as far as commentaries go.  For all the complainining about Chase not being on the commentary, this group commentary is miles [infinitely] better than the \\"European Vacation\\" commentary, which ONLY featured Chase.  Matty does reveal the studio nearly cut the fried cat scene, and only due to postive reaction from test audiences were they able to keep that in the movie.<br /><br />That leaves us with the physical merchandise: four coasters, \\"I Survived A Griswold Family Christmas\\" pin, a Santa hat, a small bag of snow powder ????, and a cheap plastic replica of the moose mug Clark and Eddie drink eggnog from.  Personally I wouldn't recommend getting the more expensive Blu-Ray versions of this movie - just pick up the cheaper editions.  You're pretty much getting the same product minus the physical merchandise.  Then again, who WOULDN'T WANT a small bag of fake snow powder and a cheap plastic Marty Moose mug?  That being said, let's move onward to the review.<br /><br />\\"I don't know what to say, except it's Christmas and we're all in misery.\\" No words were more aptly spoken.  After the rather disappointing misfire of \\"European Vacation\\", John Hughes and Chevy Chase return Clark W. Griswold to his former glory.  Hilarious, extremely relatable, and just as good as the original \\"Vacation\\", \\"Christmas Vacation\\" is one of those instant secular Christmas classics that become a tradition for so many families, just like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Story\\" (a movie that personally I abhor).<br /><br />The movie features classic performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, the in-laws, and the two Griswold children.  Brian Doyle-Murry (Bill Murray's older brother) also returns to the franchise as Frank Shirely, Clark W. Griswold's boss.  He appeared in \\"Vacation\\" in a brief scene as a Kamp Komfort clerk.  Doris Roberts (who plays Marie Barone on my all time favorite sitcom, \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\") plays Frances, Ellen's mother.  Also a pre-Seinfield Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, along with Nicholas Guest, plays a rather yuppy, above it all couple by the names of Margo and Todd Chester who operate as a foil to Clark's outlandish behaviors.  They find Christmas cliche and are not observant of any holiday traditions.  Naturally they find it difficult living by the Grisworlds, and throughout the course of the film encounter several obstacles and even extensive property damage.<br /><br />Like the original \\"Vacation\\", why \\"Christmas Vacation\\" has become such an endurable holiday favorite is its relatability.  John Hughes was truly an absolutely hysterical guy, but he crafted his films and scripts in such a way that people from various walks of life can watch his films and instantly identify with the mad-cap hysterics taking place on screen.  Yet both the aforementioned Vacation movies transcend mere slapstick into something deeper.  Also notable is this is the only vacation movie that is set in Chicago wholly, as the Griswolds not traveling but rather staying home for Christmas.<br /><br />Like \\"Vacation\\", \\"Christmas Vacation\\" shows Clark W. Griswold as an over-idealistic sentamentalist who just wants to give his family the best Christmas vacation ever, despite his zany, over the top antics and the \\"threshold of hell\\" that so frequently occurs.  We've all been in family gatherings that have gone ary.  Everything that goes wrong pretty much does, from a fried pussy cat, a burning Christmas tree, overbearing relatives, malfunctioning decorations, and bad relations with your neighbors.  Yet despite all his difficulties, ultimately Clark W. Griswold prevails in treating his family to a great Christmas vacation.<br /><br />The real strength of both \\"Vacation\\" and \\"Christmas Vacation\\" is that, at its heart, we see the Clark truly wanting the best for his family, and though the Griswolds are long suffering, ultimately they know the meaning of family unity and togetherness.  Hughes is a sentimentalist, and as both this film and \\"Home Alone\\" show, like Dickens' Ebeneezer Scrooge, he knows Christmas and keeps it well.<br /><br />As this is more of an adult comedy under the National Lampoon moniker, \\"Christmas Vacation\\" does feature some racier elements.  While there is no nudity like the first two films, there are numerous profanities scattered throughout, including the infamous \\"We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f---ing Kaye!\\"  Audrey also tells her mother she has nightmares about what Rusty does alone in his bed at night when she is not lying in bed next to him (referring to masturbation).  When Eddie arrives, he talks to Clark about how big the dog's testicles are,and says he has some \\"Mississippi Leg Hound\\".  Eddie tells Clark that if the dog begins humping his leg, he should allow the dog to continue until climax and then clean off his jeans from the dog's . . . sex cells.<br /><br />Also continuing a character thread from the first film, we see that Clark not only flirts with a store clerk he meets early on in the film, but has an elaborate fantasy regarding the clerk Mary naked in a swimming pool midway through.  The film shows Mary getting out of the pool in a head and neck shot, but before her breasts are seen Ruby Sue, Eddie's daughter, comes in and interrupts Clark's fantasy.  There is also an extended shot of Eddie dropping raw sewage into Clark's sceptic system.<br /><br />The film opens with Clark, with family in tow, going out to pick out a Christmas tree.  One notable mention is this opening sequence mark's the film's ONLY reference to Jesus Christ, the true reason for the season.  There are no nativity scenes or other religious referneces, etc, which is somewhat strange given the overtly religious nature of the origin for Christmas.  Even Kevin McCallister in \\"Home Alone\\" (another John Hughes movie, made a year after \\"Christmas Vacation\\") hides in a nativity scene and goes to church.  Clark and his family memorably have an almost horrible wreck with some rednecks and gets lodged under a semi, before taking out a the Christmas lot sign.  Given Clark's driving record, he most have some truly expensive auto-insurance policies.  Upon arrival, they wander off into the woods, where Clark finds an enormous tree which he is adamant is the Griswold Family Christmas Tree!  Bringing no saw, Clark uproots the tree and drives the tree home, roots and all, strapped to his family truckster from the first film.<br /><br />The first half of the film sets up Clark and Ellen preparing for Christmas and the arrival of the in-laws.  So many of us can relate to those awkward family gatherings, and the Griswolds are no exceptions.  Roger Ebert in his review from 1989 critized the movie for the way Hughes handles the inlaws, saying they functioned more as a homogenous unit and serve as a backdrop to Chevy Chase's antics, much like the majority of the dwarves blending seamlessly into the background in Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\".  The in-laws never really distinguish themselves or make themselves notable in the script.<br /><br />I disagree rather strongly with this assessment.  While the main focus is indeed on Chase, there are many moments involving the in-laws that are not only quite funny but often quite realistic.  Hughes writes with an economy befitting an hour and a half comedy; he gets every bit that he can from both sets of grandparents and Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany (played by Mae Questral in her last film appearance, and the voice of Betty Boop).  Alas, as I have grown older I can truly relate to the rather sad state elderly people get into when they begin to experience dementia, Alzheimer's, and senility.<br /><br />Although the script is already crowded with these extra characters, one notable omission is the lack of any children, aunts and uncles.  As far as we know, Beverly and Clark were only children and Rusty and Audrey have no first cousins.  I think there could have been some memorable interactions had Hughes brought in some first cousins.<br /><br />Thoughout the first half, the in-laws arrive, Clark gets locked in the attic (and watches some old home movies, before being quite abruptly interrupted in a very funny, very painful moment), and struggles with the art of exterior illumination.  He meets an attractive sales clerk at the mall and tries to make himself visible to his boss in a good way, all the while failing miserably.  Another memorable line is when the parents arrive, Clark says \\"Well I'm gonna park the cars and get the luggage, and well, I'll be outside for the season.\\"  I've known a few times when people (my father in particular) escape into other areas (outside, other parts of the house), to escape the chaos of the Christmas gatherings.<br /><br />In a memorable ensemble scene when Clark and Ellen finally get the thousands upon thousands of Christmas lights finally working, Clark hugs each family member and then moves on to Cousin Eddie, hoping the Christmas lights \\"adds\\" to Eddie and Katherine's festive cheer and enjoyment of the holiday season.  He then promptly realises that Eddie and Katherine are standing in his front yard and goes into shock.<br /><br />Randy Quaid deftly plays Cousin Eddie, the ultimate trailer-trash cousin.  Like Chevy Chase to Clark W. Griswold, Randy Quaid was tailor made for this role.  Having been out of work for seven years (he's holding out for a management position, Katherine informs Ellen), they have lost their farm from the first movie and are now living in an RV.  Katherine and Eddie had four children (and she was pregnant with a fifth) in the first movie.  Hughes promptly dispenses with the extra children and there are only two children present, Rocky and Ruby Sue, as Eddie explains the older ones are working in a carnival.  I also love when Clark says he and Ellen will be Eddie's children some Christmas presents (as Eddie doesn't have any presents for his children due to financial hardships), and Eddie says he wants Clark to buy himself a really nice present for being so generous.  Cracks me up!  The sled sequence is also quite funny.<br /><br />Cousin Eddie promptly interjects life into the second half of the movie.  While the first half leading up to Cousin Eddie's arrival are quite funny, Randy Quaid almost steals the show.  He just nails his performance wonderfully.  Redneck, broke, and just overall idiotic, Randy was born to play this role.  I've always been rather creeped out when Eddie tells Rusty \\"Come on, let's go find your sister.\\"  Given that we know he french kisses his daughter from the first movie, the whole exchange just has a very creepy undercurrent.<br /><br />The squirrelscene is quite funny too.  Watching the movie on TV can lead to interesting cuts.  One of my favorites is when Clark's father is talking to Clark, and he asks his dad how his dad managed to make it through the holidays.  His father's answer: \\"I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels\\", at which they both laugh.  I've seen several cuts where they simply elimiate that last part \\"from Jack Daniels\\", completely ruining the joke.  Clark's reading of the \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" (barely begun and unfinished as the performance is) is another great moment.<br /><br />The main driving plot device that sets up the climax of the film is Clark has put down money for a new swimming pool but does not have the money to pay for the pool.  He is relying on his bonus to cover the costs.  As he has worked for his company for seventeen years and every one of those years he has gotten a bonus ensures that he has certainity [is certain] he will likewise get a bonus this year.  Ultimately we discover there is no forth-coming monetary bonus and is instead enrolled in a Jelly of the Month Club, which Eddie promptly points out is a gift that keeps giving the whole year through.<br /><br />Clark then memorably goes into probably the best single moment in the entire Vacation franchise, railing against his boss and how he wants him brought to Clark's house so he can tell his boss how worthless he is.  In a nod to the original, still unseen ending to \\"Vacation\\", where Clark kidnaps Roy Wally at his house, Cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss Frank Shirley and brings him to Clark's residence.  A swat team promptly goes into rescue Frank Shirley and just like \\"Vacation\\", Shirley decides not to press charges and reinstates Clark's bonus, as well as the other employees' bonus.  In the end, Clark looks at the camera and says \\"I did it\\", showing he was successful in his aims at having a great Christmas after all<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic Christmas movie.  For those concerned with the profanity then watch the movie on one of the regular cable TV channels.  This is Hughes at his best.  If I had to choose between this and \\"Vacation\\", I'd give a (very, very) slight edge to \\"Vacation\\", but both are easily the best the Vacation franchise have to offer!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I finally decided to review The Avengers and I chose it for my 100th review. I only saw The Avengers in the theater two times. The first time I loved it and would have given it 5 stars, the second time I saw it I began to see the flaws in the film and gave it 4.5 stars. I haven't seen the film since, but on a whim I decided to check it out of my local Redbox and see it again and it's sad to say The Avengers seems to get slightly worse every time I see it and that is what separates it from truly great films that hold up in after multiple viewings. I think I need to back up a little bit before I go into my review. First I am a Marvel fan. It was the comic company I grew up reading. I grew up on X-Men comics (X-MEN, X-FACTOR, UNCANNY X-MEN and X-Force) Spiderman comics (All of them) G.I. JOE and Transformers. Those were my first tier comics that were followed by The Avengers, Punisher, Iron Man, Daredevil and others. Marvel is my favorite comic company and though I don't buy comics anymore I still go back and read my old ones, so when the first X-Men came out in 2000 I was ecstatic. I loved seeing some of my favorite characters come to live and the great Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen play an older Xavior and Magneto perfectly. I know Blade films had come before, but this was the true beginning of the rise of Marvel comic inspired films that were followed by Spiderman, Fantastic Four and Daredevil films. I like everyone else was happy when Marvel took more control over their properties and making plan to make an Avengers film. It was an ambitious move by the company it needed the tie in films to be successful and they were. All of the films made money and I personally thought all the films were above average to great except Thor. Leading up to the release of The Avengers I was excited especially after seeing the trailers and it having Hawkeye my favorite Avenger in it. Going into last summer is was my most anticipated film outside of The Dark Knight Rises, and on theoutside it did live up to the hype, but with three viewings I see that it didn't and The Avengers is an overrated film.<br /><br />I know the vast majority of people know the plot of the film, so I won't waste my time or your time giving an outline of the plot of the film I will just point out its major flaws. First is the excitement and anticipation factor. Everyone wanted to see The Avenger film and all these characters and actors together and were overly excited about that as was I. That joy blinded me as I absolutely sure it did others to the flaws. I was too excited seeing all the characters together and the load noises to notices the lack of story and characters. I've done this before, but I've compared The Avengers to The Expendable films. Now don't cuss me out I'm not saying The Avengers is anywhere near as bad as The Expendables, but it takes kind of the same premise bringing together all these great action stars from the past and present into one film, and you automatically got your audience who cares if the film doesn't have a decent plot, character development or even great action people will still pay to see the likes of Jet Li, Jason Statham, Steve Austin, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and the rest. I paid to see the first film and rented the second and once you get past the glow of seeing all these iconic actions stars on the screen together you see the major flaws the films had. That is the same with The Avengers.<br /><br />All the flaws extend from the writing by the fanboys Joss Whedon who they think can do no wrong, and that was the overabundance of S.H.E.I.L.D. I understand they are necessary and I enjoyed looking at the beautiful Cobie Smulders (Maria Hill), but outside of Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) they should have been hidden in the back ground. Then there are the plot wholes like Thor appearing out of nowhere without real explanation even though at the end of the Thor film he is trapped in Asgard not able to returnto Earth. I know Joss tries to attribute all the plot wholes to the captor and I find it to convenient like he couldn't come up with a real and good explanation. Moving onto the characters like Captain America played by Chris Evans. Though I am not a big fan of Chris I thought he did a pretty good job in the decent first Captain America film, but here he seems almost emotionless like he's some sort of robot and seemed to be sleep walking through the film adding nothing to it. Robert Downey Jr. of course gave a witty performance as Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo is without a doubt the best Bruce Banner. He gave the best performance out of the cast showing the depth and emotion the character has stuck in the situation he is in. The two characters and actors who seemed to have gotten the shaft are the ones who deserved the most plot development and screen time. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) did get a little more screen time then Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), but her role and character development was overshadowed by the big three. She is a great character and deserved more screen time, and who doesn't want to see more of Scarlett playing Natasha. Finally there is Jeremy Renner who was basically shafted as Hawkeye. I biased because he's my favorite Avenger character, but Clint Barton is a great character being orphaned as a child, growing up in a carnival by Swordsman and Trickshot. There others including the character I love in the Ultimate Marvel universe. Hawkeye deserved better and Renner agreed saying the character in the film wasn't the one he signed on to be. It's a pity because Renner is a better actor then Evens, Jackson, Smulders and Hemsworth. The character and actor deserved more screen time especially with his chemistry with Johansson.<br /><br />All right let's move on to the director and writer Joss Whedon. I really don't understand the overblown praise the man gets like his the second coming of the Messiah and can do no wrong. Don't get me wrong I like theman I think he's a really good writer. Though he had one really bad early misstep with his screenplay for Alien Resurrection he's done a really great job. He's done a really good job as a writer and creator with Buffy, Dollhouse, Angel and Firefly. I am still pissed off at Fox for canceling Dark Angel and Firefly. Though if Dark Angel hadn't been canceled I doubt Firefly would have made it on air on FOX, but maybe another channel would have taken a chance and the show would have been more successful. Any screw FOX let's get back to Whedon who is a really good writer and creator, but isn't perfect, and as a director he's even further from perfect. He showed great potential with Serenity which I think of as by far his best directorial performance. With The Avengers he just seemed out of his element with the story and actors/characters that weren't his own creations and I hope he hasn't gotten in over his head with Marvel giving him the power they have. As writer I still have faith in him, but as a director I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope he is up to the task with sequel. I know it probably won't happen but I hope he doesn't include Iron Man, Thor or Captain America. I'd rather he writes his own back stories for other characters like The Wasp, Ant Man, Hercules, Black Knight and give more time to Hawkeye and The Black Widow.<br /><br />I know this review sounds like I disliked or hated the film, but I didn't I really did enjoy. The action/effects were simply great as was Hulk who was finally brought to life nearly perfectly. As I said Downey Jr. was again good and brought humor to the film as did Clark Gregg who I was disappointed to see die. Scarlett with gave a good performance and with Renner did a good job with his limited and short changed role as Hawkeye. I also must mention Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He was one of the best think in Thor and was great in The Avengers. Overall is The Avengers a one of the best films of the year or a truly great film no. It's overrated, but a good action/comic book film with a flawed plot with a lack of character development/chemistry and some average acting.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story of the silo is a complex and all too believable one. This story has no hero and no evil villain to be overcome. Just two opposing philosophies and at the end I wasn't sure that the victor was any more right than the loser. I look forward to reading more from Mr. Howey.
B000VUQ4HW|4.0|Again I was recommended Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror by a friend and I've heard that as a film fan I should watch it, and decided to like I did with Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis. I had recognized the name of the film, but that was the extent of my knowledge of the 1922 film. Before seeing the film I looked it up and found its history along with the history of Dracula and the vampire genre quite interesting. Nosferatu wasn't the first vampire film. I thought it was, but apparently the first film to have a vampire in it was even earlier in the 20th century with Vampire of the Coast in 1909. Also I assumed that Nosferatu would have Dracula in it, but it doesn't. The film was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel and the director F. W. Murnau and writer Henrik Galeen decided to make some slight changes. Stoker's widow Florence Stoker sued the company that made Nosferatu for and wanted all the copies of the film destroyed. She won the case and virtually all the copies of the film were destroyed, but of course a handful of copies survived. Nosferatu wasn't the first unauthorized film adaptation of Stoker's novel either. In fact it was the Hungarian film Dracula's Death in 1921, and was the first to use the character and name Dracula in film. Sadly all copies of the film have been lost. It was interesting learning about the film and early vampire and Dracula history, but onto the film itself.<br /><br />The films story deviates heavily from Stoker's novel with the film replacing Dracula for Count Orlok (Max Schreck) and changing how he can move around. Dracula was able to move around during daylight, but Count Orlok couldn't. Being caught in sunlight meant death for the vampire. I'm thinking that is where that take on vampires and Dracula originated from and has been used in the majority of films and TV series to date. Also unlike Stoker's Dracula, Count Orlok doesn't turn people into vampires he simply kills them. Also changes the names of certain characters as well. The film follows Thomas Hutter (Jonathan Harker) and his wife Ellen Hutter (Greta Schröder) who live in the German town of Wisborg. Thomas gets sent to Transylvania to visit a client Count Orlok who is interested in moving to the small town. Along his journey town folk tell warn him about werewolves and people refuse to take him close to where Orlok lives. Thomas also finds a book with information about vampires, but he ignores it continuing on his journey. Arriving at Count Orlok's castle home Orlok become interested in Thomas's wife's neck, and from there it's raise to get back to Wisborg with a trail of bodies being left behind the traveling Orlok. Back in Wisborg bodies begin to pile up and the people believe it's the plague while Ellen knows it's the vampire Orlok and sacrifices herself to save the town and kill Orlok who loses track of time and doesn't realize its sunrise and dies.<br /><br />Story wise the film isn't good. I mean Orlok's motives for going after Ellen just don't make sense especially if the sun can kill him. I mean he travels hundreds of miles just because he wants to bite her neck and drain her blood. There are thousands of people closer by in Transylvania he could easily get access to yet he decides to leave his safe home traveling hundreds of miles risking exposure to sunlight or having his ship sink just because at a whim he likes the look of a woman's neck. Now I'm no vampire, but that doesn't make sense and I certainly wouldn't take that chance, but that's just me. That bugged me throughout the film, along with why would he lose track of time just because he drank the blood of a pure (sinless) woman. I mean it didn't make sense. What didn't bother me was the silent film itself. You would think that a century old film wouldn't be able to stand up or keep my attention, but it did. After the first five minutes I basically forgot I was watching a silent film or that is was one hundred years old. I also enjoyed Max Schreck as Count Orlok. He just had a very scary and menacing look to him and gave a good performance. He's no Christopher Lee or Bela Lugosi, but he did a really good job playing a character who was essentially Dracula. I want to praise the music, but the music in the film wasn't the original score done by Hans Erdmann. The majority of his score was lost over time. I believe the score done for my version of the film was done by Alexis Savelief a French composer. Anyway whoever did the score did a great job. The music wonderfully matched each scene perfectly bringing whatever tone was needed from joyfulness to terror, humor, fear and love the music matched it perfectly. As a horror film I think Nosferatu is great with its score, tone and facial expressions make you believe in the terror and fear the characters felt, but like I said the thing that majorly hurt this film were the changes from Stoker's work that affected Orlok's (Dracula) motives.<br /><br />Is Nosferatu a truly great or excellent film no, but it is a pretty good one that I enjoyed and it gave me a chance to learn about film history including the history of vampires and Dracula in film. Is this a must see I would say yes if you're a true film lover and interested in film history or the history of vampires and Dracula in film otherwise I would skip it most likely won't be for you with no load explosions or blood and guts or torture that people seem to need in modern horror films.
0307596885|5.0|These are the stories of a woman looking back from near the end of a life well lived. Almost all of them are set in the past, mostly the forties, the war and after, when the author herself would have been coming of age. They are stories of growing up, leaving home, first jobs, discoveries, and disappointment. Many of them continue for decades after their opening events, so that their characters too share the author's sadder but wiser perspective on their younger selves. Most of the protagonists are female, and those few that feature men are articulated mainly by their relationships with women. But young requited love, the staple of romance, plays little part; most of the sexual relationships are unequal, involving characters who are tied down or damaged, and two of the most affecting are not sexual at all.<br /><br />Several stories feature trains. In \\"To Reach Japan,\\" a young wife's amorous adventure in the sleeper of an eastbound transcontinental train causes problems for her when she reaches Toronto. (This is also one of the few stories in the book with a punchline ending, a form which Munro usually avoids.) In \\"Train,\\" a returning soldier jumps off the train just short of his destination to begin a life that comes upon him by accident. A suburban rail car takes the young female protagonist of \\"Amundsen\\" to the TB sanatorium where she will have her first experiences of teaching, love, and the let-down of reality; this may be my favorite of all the stories.<br /><br />But the most moving thing in the book may not be a story at all, but a note from the author towards the end, headed FINALE: \\"The final four works in this book are not quite stories. They form a separate unit, one that is autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact. I believe they are the first and last -- and the closest -- things I have to say about my own life.\\" Seen purely as stories, the vignettes that follow are not the best things in the book, and the book itself may not be the best of Munro. But, like everything she writes, only stronger, they have the quality of real experience. And the implication that she may not write any more is very sad indeed.not be the best of Munro. But, like everything she writes, only stronger, they have the quality of real experience. And the implication that she may not write any more is very sad indeed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In think this is the best game I have bought for free in a long while besides angry birds. I would recommend it to everyone-
B004XIZK5K|3.0|Some good information poorly presented in a jumble. Good for those new to fitness. Would not recommend for anyone seeking challenging and original workouts. This read much more like a novel by any joe schmoe than a fitness guide.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Of course I love it.  it is angry birds of course!  Angry birds are awesome as usual and I recommend it
B004EPYZQC|5.0|The product got here fast and safely at a great price.<br />I appreciate the inclusion of an extended addition.<br /><br />As for the movie, of course its great - cars and good-looking guys. :]
B00AMBH70S|3.0|There was a lot of action and there were parts that were good however the plot wasn't put together well.  It also left me hanging at the end like what happened to main character and the woman.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|best app of this nature for my kindle fire so far, I would absolutely pay for this app if my fire could perform those functions.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I would recommend this product and it just came in time. i very much like the compartments provided inside the bag to keep all my lenses.
B006O6F932|3.0|It could be made more sturdier for the price .. to expensive for purse. Only the rich kids parents can afford all the accessories.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I picked this up as a free app of the day and was very surprised and pleased.  It is a simple game to play.  It is visually pleasing.  It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it is addictive, much like the original Final Fantasy for the NES.<br /><br />There are some glitches, like things you purchased (in the game-no money out of pocket) are taken away and you have to buy them again.  Funny thing is this hasn't happened on the original free app I got on my cheep tablet, where I am much farther along in the game.  It did happen on my Kindle Fire before I even completed my first set of missions.  I have probably completed about ten sets of  missions on my smaller cheep tablet.<br /><br />I would recommend this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love Quell because it challenges you on different levels, and always leaves you wanting to play more. Sometimes, you will get seriously stuck, but its the best feeling in the world when you finally figure it out.
B008KE3960|3.0|The headline says it all.  It's o.k., but there are other games I would rather play.  I don't want to discourage others from buying it, but I got it as a free app.  I'm glad I didn't pay because it is just one more of this type of game.

B005FITIK0|5.0|Charlize plays a young woman facing many hardships with courage and determination.<br />Her acting skills continue to be found in all the scenes of this film.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I just recieved the E17 as a gift today.  I recently purchased a pair of Westone 4R headphones and I felt like my phone (running spotify) wasn't providing a well-rounded signal to the earphones.  I played a few songs on Spotify using this amplifier and it works great.  The 4Rs have two lower frequency drivers in each ear, and I could immediately tell the bass response was improved using the E17.  Most noticeable was kick drums have a lot more initial punch than they used to coming straight from the phone.  Mids and high are very clear too.  When there's a lot of sound across the frequency spectrum I can still hear each part of the music clearly.  I think the output from my phone was running out of available power when playing more complex music.  for example if there was a lot of bass coming through, mids and highs would suffer loss of gain.  The bass through my phone didn't have much punch, although it was smooth.  With the amp, bass hits are louder (as they should be), but it hasn't lost any of it's smoothness, like when large strings are playing.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I think this is one of his best films. I'm surprised it didn't win an Academy Award, it is that good.<br />Brad plays a man who wants to turn a baseball team around by unorthodox means while being opposed by just about everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is no problems with this game on my kindle, it runs smoothly. If you love minecraft, you have to get this app. I have never plaid minecraft or even heard of it until now and I officially love it!
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Probably the main reason I didn't feel this film lived up to the hype is that I am not a fan of Owen Wilson. His portrayal of the romantic lead in this film just left me cold.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|It has a nice little story and you have to find hidden objects. There are several different puzzles. You can get hints if you can't find something so it is an easy relaxing game.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Kevin Spacey is brilliant. This story kept me riveted and fascinated. A well written story and a well produced film.<br />Highly recommend it.
B00344EAFA|1.0|it was not wrapped in bubble wrap.  i will never order from you again..  the case was in very bad shape... i am keeping it because i love the movie and wanted to watch it as soon as i got it...
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Well, I love Hawaii to begin with, so I adored this film just for the environment. George Clooney gives a fabulous performance as a husband deceived. Slowly throughout the film he learns that his wife was duped and used by her former lover as she now lays dying in a hospital room. Not to be missed.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this one suits me fine.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.<br /><br />It's great!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|To see a man walking on a cable from one tower to the other tower of the World Trade Center, in bracing winds at the top of the world, is a sight that makes you wonder what would drive a man to even attempt such a thing. You learn the reasons as the film tells the story of this daring man from his youth to his success walking across the air space of many buildings throughout the world.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Been playing this game off and on while traveling. It is difficult and I enjoy the challenge. Love puzzle type games.
B00005S6K6|5.0|The critics didn't seem to like this film. What's not to like? You've got Meryl Streep, Rober DeNiro, Harvey Keitel in a romance about two married people who accidentally fall in love with each other to the dismay of their married partners. It's a serious film, not a comedy, and played with a deep resonance to what makes our hearts come alive.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This movie musical keeps the kids glued to the TV, a lot of singing, and has become a household classic.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is the best performance of the show I've ever seen. Being on film does not take away from the splendor of the performances, or the talent of the performers. Beautiful music, brilliant voices, and a story that never quits.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|Love Stargate series, the characters, the stories and it's theme.  Would love to see more Stargate Altantis, sorry there were only 5 seasons.
B0013FNC38|1.0|I thought I might like this artist. I was sadly mistaken. I really dont like anything about him and I really dont like his lyrics. Will never buy again.
0938045768|5.0|This book is excellent. It has definitely seen improvement in my body and my overall mental view of fitness. I could not previously find workouts that fit my schedule or my level of fitness, but the fact that each of the Big 6 is broken into ten separate exercises, three levels each, is very graspable for anyone. Really...anyone can do the basics of the basics in here, and you WILL see improvement. I was the biggest skeptic about things like this, and I always gave up with weight training or fitness regiments at gyms because I didn't see improvement even after months. This, I have seen improvements with. They are small, tiny improvements, but they are there, tangible and visible, and that's what a lot of people need to get moving. It's nice to have a goal, as well. I picked two exercises I hope to be able to master in the next year and a half.<br />I eas even doing these exercises base levels while undergoing treatment for cancer....despite my illness, and weaknesses, and side effects, I had the ability to do some workouts still, to try to keep my body healthy, energetic, and in shape. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their health, their strength, and their outlook on workouts.<br />For the record, I used this in conjunction with a few other books, and some yoga as warmups.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Knocks a lot of artists out of his loop. Great product, love the voice and lyrics. LOve it need I say more
0345528581|5.0|Easy to follow. Lots of exercise to choose from. You'd be surprised how some of the simplest looking exercises in this book will drain and strain you to your core. Definitely a must have if you are at all interested in working out, at any level. You can work these into fitness routines, make whole workouts with just this books, use it to supplement other purchases (as I have). Must have.

B00846F1YW|2.0|how come I can't get past Bills room looking for the journel? I have done this room at least six times I've uninstalled twice.  I have gone through the whole game three times. I can't get past it. It says missing accompliced then goes to loading then it goes back to my home screen. I would rate this a lot higher if I could play the whole game. I bate paying for something I can't use. I am hesitant to buy something from Nevosoft again.

In the end all of the extra bookmarks, stitches, or broomsticks isn't nearly as important as having all 8 movies in one easy to access space.<br /><br />Great movies and a great collection to put them all together in one place on my bookshelf
B000J233SK|5.0|A unique sound like no other I've heard.  Fantastic voice and the music is spellbinding.  I could listen to her all day.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I got this as a gift and it was very well received.  Having read the book before watching it with them it was interesting to see how it was adapted into a movie.  Overall its a great choice and another fun adaptation of a Dr Seuss book
B008RTJQDI|5.0|These girls have one of the most unique sound I've heard in many years.  Totally new sound that is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard .
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was sucked in that's all I can say. The ending left me wondering what really happened though. All in all good though!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Very creative, enjoyable for kids & adults.  I bought this for my child, but I know I'll be watching it with her, and I'm looking forward to it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so many bad reviews on this but. Let me be the first to tell you that they are all a lie. This book is so addicting. The characters are thoroughly thought out and the plot keeps you engaged the whole time. I highly suggest reading this book!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|There is not as much as excitement as angry birds starwars and agry birds space.  Try the other ones first.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|As always, Brandon Sanderson delivers a terrific story wrapped in an interesting and captivating magic system. His characters draw the reader into the world he created in such detail, and all of it weaving together makes for an absolutely amazing read.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the fact that I was able to chop as much fruit as I wanted to.  I could never do that at home!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book, hope to read the movie.......<br />All the characters were really well thought of, I could picture them all without much description.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like angry birds, so when amazon had this available for free, I jumped on it. I lke the theme, which was something new and made the game fun
B009MCRHH6|5.0|made my christmas :)) found this app for free today which worked out in sure its going to be worth ig by the price of it. :))
B004UID2LC|1.0|On the freedi app you can't do half the things you could do on the original. You can't sign in and because of that you can't subscribe or look at there channel. You also can't comment or like<br />Or add to favorites w.l. or play list
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It's pretty sophisticated technology, but I wish it would be able to create photo collages. THAT'D BE AWESOME! Other than that, it's a wonderful photo editing app, especially for a tablet.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|My grandson had Clint Eastwood Western Movies on his Christmas list and was thrilled to see that I got everyone of them I could find for him to watch with his dad. They were very happy with Pale Rider, which has always been a favorite.<br />The product came in great condition and ready to wrap for Christmas.<br />Thank you!
B003O86FMW|3.0|You don't get into most of the juicy parts until later on.. but other than that, I like it a lot.
0394818237|5.0|This is to my grandson, who has just started learning English and I do hope that this book wouls help him to lear to speak soon. I was extremely happy that the book arrived well ahead of time proposed.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I think this book is quite interesting and I am sure interested in it. Thanks for my chance to review this interesting book.<br />.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent love story that moves quite rapidly and keeps you entranced all the way through! Can't wait to read the next one!
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and requires only as much attention as you wish to give to it. The Storm8 registration is simple and safe with no constant alerts for attention. The Kindle version does lag behind other versions as far as development goes, which would be okay if it were clearer why you're missing out. That costs it a star by my book, but that really only becomes relevant once you're well into the game. Overall, a fun game for both me and my son to share.
1609611543|3.0|I purchased this based on a recommendation from my doctor.  It was an easy read and had some interesting concepts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is really good. Super addicting and intense. It's next to impossible to predict what's coming next, great writing and storyline(s).
0385535147|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and after some stinkers, this one gets back to the type of stories he used to write. Welcome back.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|First person story with a lot of humor. This story provides a lot of insight  into the mentality of the Muslim way of thinking. Basically they are 11th century barbarians.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Thought it would be nice... Screen protector had a huge bubble and acted like it was to much material for the screen so it got pushed up plus the case cracked from a small fall onto carpet.... Just get a otter box if you want protection and if you need waterproof get a container or a plastic bad . This case isn't even worth trying
0062213423|5.0|My daughter loves this book.  Lots of photos and info on 1D!  You can't go wrong if you have a teenage girl.
0545265355|5.0|English is not my first language and I bought this books for practice,  they were excellent, and little short for my taste,  but is the right size for the story.  Really recommended
B009YG2ND8|4.0|The FF3 remake has been around on many other devices for a while, but if you want to have a solid RPG on your Kindle Fire, you can't go wrong with this title. The high price point is hard to get past, but in this case you pay for quality. No glitches or translation problems with this one.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I just love the words in his songs!! He is straight from the heart and I would totally recommend this if you like Kid Rock.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Currently one of my favorite casual games on my Kindle Fire. The levels are very challenging and the gadgets from The Stash are very rewarding. The missions give purpose to the game and keep giving you new goals to challenge yourself. There is high replay value with this title and I find myself going straight to it whenever I have some time to kill. It is very easy to get addicted to this game.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Seemed like they took the elements of a movie and threw in weird nouns-Ted, and lots of crude verbs to make a mashed up movie.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|It is a great true stroy that keeps hooked to the last minute. Nice movie for those whose like adventures.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|liked the muxic selection Rod was his usual voice and enthusiam into the music!wouldreccommend it to everybody!okay enough with the amount of words!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This is the first book of an excellent trilogy. The characters are the main thing which drives these novels, with them all being flawed yet believable and compelling. I would liken these works to the Game of Thrones, but they have more action without it seeming excessive. In fact, I think they would have made a better TV series! If you like books of this ilk or are starving for great work after the void left by this series or the great Lord of the Rings trilogy (also recommended - although you've probably all seen the films by now!), then I would like to save you hours of looking. You should try the sprawling steampunk-esque [[ASIN:0345459407 Perdido Street Station]] by China Mieville or the instant fantasy classic [[ASIN:1481147382 Into The Trees]] by J. Alastair Nash. Add them to your wishlist now! They are very different, but both left me with the same satisfaction as this excellent trilogy. This is perhaps because, like Abercrombie, the authors are English so somehow bring a realism to their works. I presume this is from living a country steeped in history having and countless ancient corridors and alleyways to explore.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has always impressed me with how he can develope four or five apparently divergent story lines that ultimately weave the tapestry of a well told tale.  I'm cutting this short... I'm down to the last 100 pages and can't wait.  Buy it, it's classic Clancy.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|It came on time. It wasnt in bad condition. It was the product i ordered. Overall, my girlfriend loved it. It was one of her christmas gifts and im happy i got it for the price i did on black friday. 16-21$ wooohoo! Thank youuuu amazon.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have Seasons 1-6 and now 7.  I haven't had a chance to view it yet, but I hope to before I get to purchase Season 8.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun to play and fairly intuitive.  Don't have to spend real cash to progress which for me is required for a free game.  Worth trying in my opinion.
B009HELT3C|3.0|Having seen the first two MIB movies we felt we had to see this one.  Overall it was ok, but nothing special.  If you've seen the others it is worth seeing for the ending, but otherwise I'd fine something else to watch.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|Finally a quality set for the Halo series. I have bought older sets for my son and struggled with snapping the pieces together or not having them fit very well. This set fit together very good and it seems like it will hold up pretty good. My son loves it and I would purchase this set again based upon the quality. I hope this set is a sign of things to come for the quality of any future Halo sets.
B00932ANQM|5.0|&#34;Seems like peaceful work&#34;. If you appreciate the military and are looking for a little love...this is the movie for you. Compelling story, engaging characters, and seems just true enough to be true.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Not a bad movie but, it's just something not right about a talking teddy bear but, plenty of good jokes and the humor only Seth can deliver.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Being of Scottish heritage I had to watch this even though I am an adult!  It was a cute story, I would recommend it.
0767817664|4.0|this is one of my all time favorites. Chris Sarandon and the whole cast played their parts beautifully! I've seen every vampire movie made since the 70's and this one is top 5.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You'll love the 2nd book as much as the 1st.  When I read the first series (within a week), I couldn't wait to get to the 2nd book.  There are alot of critics out there that don't like the authors writing but hey, after all, it is fiction.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|just did not enjoy..cute graphics but that's about it..failed the kid test..he did not like it either..uninstalled it after about an hour
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I know alot of people don't like the authors writing but this is after all Fiction!  I literally could not put the book down and enjoyed the ending with Christian's version.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Through the complete series one can be sure to laugh or cry with or know the feeling of the time, Jane Seymore and her co-actors did an outstanding job through all those years together.
B005CRQ2XA|3.0|This book did not really catch my eye  but I would say it is a decent book. Like  I said it wasn't the best but I like Greg and all the stuff about middle school.Trust me I'm a huge fan of the series but I would like a better storyline
B00992CF6W|4.0|After this catches up with the full version or at least the xbox version then it will be a 6 star game.  It plays wonderfully on the Kindle and the Kindle hd<br />  Looks beautiful on the Kindle HD.  My wife and I play it together all the time.  So fun.  Definitely buy it.  It's worth more.
B004SIP9RO|1.0|The DVD does not work.  The other two dvd's I purchase worked fine.  I want a refund or a new dvd that works.
0307895475|5.0|Amazing revised guide, including also the new two expansions; recommended to all want to discover all secrets of the game, with suggestions and complete walkthrough!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is truly a great film.  I especially enlnoyed the performances of Scarlet Johannson and Bill Murray.  Scarlet's presence on screen is breathtaking.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|The show is not how it used to be in the first seasons but there still some good episodes and a plot that you want to watch unravel.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Transformers movies are my best action movies I can watch them over and over again.  Can't wait for a fourth movie
1439190275|5.0|I am a Type 2 Diabetic.<br />What does this mean?  I means that I spent 35 years mistreating my body.  Now, I'm trying to fix that.<br />I was taking 30 units of insulin morning and evening when my Dr. recommended this book to me.<br />In less than 1 month of following this book and changing my lifestyle a little, I was able to get completely off of insulin and a year later, I am still not using insulin and my blood sugar is still in the normal range.<br />Be aware, this is a manual for a new lifestyle.  It is very dry reading.  Please push yourself to continue reading and make the commitment to follow what you learn in the book.  You will not be sorry.
0525953728|5.0|Great book. All Americans should be proud & thankful we have warriors of this caliber in our services. May God Bless them.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Having the book to go along with the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray....this is awesome!!!<br />It arrived just in time for me to have a Christmas Eve Time Warp good time!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book! You will laugh and you will cry, a Must read!<br />Now hopefully I can find another book to keep my attention. Slammed and Point of Retreat were awesome also!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Awesome movie. Fat Amy/Fat Patricia stole the show...I am not a fan of musicals or movies involving characters singing throughout the movie but this one really nailed it with a great blend of comedy with pitch perfect actors.
B0092YRYBS|5.0|Even better than Tourist History, and you get live versions of several songs! Not to say that I didn't enjoy the first album, but this one is awesome. Listen to &#34;Settle&#34; and &#34;The World is Watching&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is different from other games. Kinda like a dream... but you can do ANYTHING you want! Its epic! Two modes one for fun building spree with no harm (Creative) and the preferred one (Survival) where you can hunt be hunted - and survive. Its a great game and I would highly recommend it. ^^
B0053O89WY|5.0|I chose this item as a xmas gift. It was well received. I would recommend this item to a friend.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I really enjoyed how James Taylor did &#34;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&#34; where he repeats &#34;watch out&#34; as if he touched a hot potato as a warning to the kids listening to the song. He improvised &#34;Baby It's Cold Outside&#34; adding that he wanted her to stay by making a hot toddy. He was true to the original &#34;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&#34; which brings tears to my eyes. He also did a French version of &#34;Oh Christmas Tree&#34;. It's a great CD or download all around.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I didn't know how great of a DJ Calvin Harris was until I heard this album. My favorite tracks are definitely Green Valley and Sweet Nothing, a great alternative to David Guetta.
B000JIHP88|5.0|It's great! I love it! My niece loves it! Her parents love it! All my family love it! It's great for kids!
B003008RWA|4.0|My group had to rhetorically analyze this documentary for AP English 3- we took notes as we watched. Our assignment was to find Moore's rhetorical strategies which include: validity, Joloff's rhetorical framework, assertions/claims, purpose, cinematic techniques, etc. Because of Moore's satirical thrusts at American Health Care, we, as Americans, were able to relate to the film and of course have a good laugh. This film is shockingly true (mostly) & is easy to rhetorically analyze. Watch with caution.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a good game and it is free. I think that invest points should be easier to get however
B0083P1QUM|4.0|i found the subject matter very interesting buy since i am a new customer a little difficult staying at the right page because i hit the wrong button.i will say as a long time reader of p,cornwell. it was't one of her best.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is a great addition to anyone who enjoys the musical. Different from the Broadway soundtrack but still very good.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Read it at list twice, intresting very much like 50 shaides, cant waite until the 3 book will/be publisht way onlyin mayyyy
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It completely blows me away at how much flack this film is getting one of the highest money making movies this year with good reason.  I apsolutely love the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan I am able to put this in my Bluray box set of Nolan's WB movies perfectly.  But seriously any one of the three blows all other live action attemps away.  Some may disagree but I can honestly say that being raised on the Adam West show and owning the other 4 films which I still wonder why I even bought them on DVD.  Nolan keeps the story going with brilliant cinamatography, acting, writing and impressive visuals that are just exciting to watch.  Christian Bale, he keeps impressing me as an actor within his perfomances each and every movie.  Anna Hathaway, finally someone got Catwoman right; not puring like a cat or in a creepy stitch work custome or with a spider-man like origin with a magic cat.  Tom Hardy as Bane was excellent like the previous villians not fully quite like the comics origins and gemics wise, but completely compturing the characteristics of the character to where it fitted within the world presented.  And the little twist in the end with JGL character genious but not to surprising if familiar with Batman comics.  This is how Batman was ment to be scene not that sorry Burton/Schumaker, it did pave the way but just makes me want to blow chunks watching them now; Burton's was grose and Schumaker was part crap mixed with where the hell did these actors go wrong to be placed in these films.<br /><br />Bottum Line is this Concluded the trilogy leaving it with no disappointment, no dead ends and no way to be out done.
B00866H7SS|5.0|First time i read books in english ,very easy to to understant and i couldnt. Pot it dowm. Intresting/and. Hoot
B006UG90RM|5.0|Vanhalen does it again they are really capturing the audience with there songs and the music is there very best
B007IXWL2C|5.0|COULDENT WAITE UNTIL IT WILL BE PUBLISHT IN HEBROW, ENJOED ITVERY mach, easyto read, very sexy book, intresting and joyfull
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Great album one of the best in my collection not a bad song on it even my kids like this music
1400069289|1.0|It was riveting, the example of the man who cannot remember, and the initial concept of cues, routines and rewards, and keeping the rewards same. The Aloca, Alcoholics anonymous and sport argument are still ok. It also talk about repackaging something into familiar if you want to introduce new behaviors. It sounds good until the stories go into  societies. I have problems especially with the societies example because the argument sounds like he is too delusional already with his own cues and rewards of intellectual grandiosity that he cannot stop his routine of blabbering for the sake of doing so.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|ZZ tops rocks, this is one of if not the best album they ever put out love to cruise to there music
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This is a great source to use because you can find words fast and easy. I recommend this wonderful item.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love games that ease me into thinking while playing. FUN action and very relaxing; excellent value for the price, still playing.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Nice book, nice read.  Not much excitement, but I enjoyed it. I love the author, and I liked the book.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to the true source of the cure for chronic pain. All physicians should have The Gerson Therapy  for reference and treatment of sick patients. If you or a loved one is suffering from any type of aliment it;s worth the read. Thank you Dr. Gerson and Charlotte Gerson for this vital information and the key to living a better life!
B008ROGZUU|5.0|I agree this is a wonderful performance.<br /><br />However, purchase with caution.  I bought my Blu-ray copy from Amazon UK when it first became available in October.  Before it even arrived, I received a note saying there was a manufacturing defect and a replacement would be sent in November.  No need to return the defective one that was in the mail.  The defect turned out to be that the audio was lost part way through the bows, not during the performance.<br /><br />Nothing came in November and finally a few weeks ago I wrote to Amazon UK asking about the replacement.  They told me there was no anticipated date for sending the replacement and instead they processed a credit to my account.  I see they are selling the Blu-ray version again or maybe they just never revised it.  I don't know.<br /><br />I recommend ordering it with caution whether it is from the UK or when it becomes available in the US.  I don't know if there were any issues with the regular DVD version.
B008VBYN80|2.0|very, very annoying to run out of energy so quickly. waiting for more energy severly interrupts the flow of playing and enjoying the game
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I love this film. The graphics and special effects are awesome. Nice that it came with the DVD and digital copies.
145162445X|5.0|Wonderful, non-fiction story-telling from Christopher Hitchen's personal physicist.  Dr. Krauss adds many personal anecdotes and tangent-facts while taking us on a journey of what we have learned about the cosmos.  Interesting asides such as the fact that Kepler successfully defending his mom from a witchcraft allegation are mentioned while explaining that when we add up how much \\"dark matter\\" has to exist to explain the motion of material in our galaxy, we find that the ratio of total matter to visible matter is not 2 to 1, but closer to 10 to 1.  If this is not a mistake, says Dr. Krauss, then the dark matter cannot be made of protons and neutrons.  There are just not enough of them.  Highly recommended... - lc
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Nothing special, but the great films are all here. I wish you could choose to show them without the extra scenes.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game has the custom settings never seen in military strategy games. I like so much that the games have the option to change yore r type of battle, name, units and generally makes you to stay in the movie and the move.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I was excited to see this as the app of the day, however I can not get it to install on my GS3.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Action was good, premise is plausible. All that being said, the story just stopped. Either they ran out of money or were way to obvious in setting up for a sequel. I was enjoying the movie and the next thing I know, it is ending and I am thinking WTF? To me, there was no real resolution or even a temporary stopping point like the end of a chapter. I would have given it 4 stars otherwise.<br />After watching the movie another couple of times, I have upgraded to 4 stars. Wish I could give a definitive reason but I enjoyed it more. Still feel like it was not ended well.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Merry Christmas to everyone. Lets continue our prayers of healing for the families in Connecticut. My heart is with them.<br />Thank you Amazon for the nice app today. It was a bit odd at first dragging droplets of goo upward to design a ladder type object to complete your task but once you figure out what to do its really cool.<br />A different type of game that's fun cute and has a little story. I think all ages would enjoy this and although I wouldn't pay 5 Dollars it may be worth it.<br />Enjoy!<br />Florida Mom
B004XWLN20|5.0|Im barely finished watching the second season. May take about a year to watch thru all 10 but its worth the time.
0307592731|3.0|This book was quite gripping at the beginning: a lost young woman sets off on a hike to \\"find herself,\\" so to speak. The beginning about her mother's death is truly sad and compelling, and the Pacific Coast Trail has long intrigued me. I also like searcher memoirs, so I was quite thrilled when I began this book. I stayed engaged as she struggled and really suffered through the trail, with occasional reflections on her past troubles: the dissolution of her family after her mother dies; leaving the husband she married too young; falling in with a heroin user and joining him; sleeping around a little bit. The problem I see it is that the reflections in the book (the retrospective part) is told from the 26 year old's perspective: as if she's reflecting on them on the trail as she walks. I wonder if it would not have been better had she reflected on that part of her life from the perspective of the 40-something who wrote the book. The events in the book happened in 1995 -- quite some time ago -- and yet we don't really benefit from the perspective of a woman of a certain age. The only such reflection is in the last couple of pages and it is not at all satisfying. In fact, it's a bit of a joke: she suggests that she has lived happily ever after because she got married four years later and had two children, which she achieved by \\"letting go.\\" Huh?<br /><br />But then again what did I expect? Right on the cover it says it's an Oprah Book club choice. There is something very daytime television about this book: a girl redeemed for her wayward youth by becoming a wife and mother, but updated for modern times with some PG sex and some drug use. A life sanitized by time. If that's what \\"letting go\\" is, fine, but it doesn't make for a good book, though it might make for a mediocre Hollywood movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Without a doubt the best of the three new batman movies. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop. Bale plays a very good bad guy.
B005ZUR724|2.0|the game is fun until gameloft does an update then you are screwed! Especially if you are using a Kindle Fire! Kindle users are always the last to get updates! For this I rate the game at a 2!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|need to download and keep till find a better one.<br />tried different dictionaries and this seems ok just for now.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|excelente producto, alta calidad, deberían de indicar que ya no viene con el fan cooler, me gusto mucho, lo recomiendo
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever I love the ending!!!! =D …the only thing I would have a problem is that it was a little dry in the beginning but it gets much better right after the first couple of pages though. Great read all in all;D
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|The music choices were good, and the voices are incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire CD more than I expected
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline(s).  I didn't feel like they tried to rush through the movie to get the story told quickly.  They took their time letting the story unfold and then they added a good twist toward the end as well as giving us a little teaser.  This is definitely a must see.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So far I am loving this game.  I was hoping it would get more challenging at a quicker pace but according to the description there are hundreds of levels so I still have a ways to go.  For some reason it is pretty addictive so I keep playing!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Obviously most Beatles fans will say nothing but great things about anything that's released today.<br />Here's my honest review.<br /><br />The box set is cosmetically beautiful and very classy<br />The albums are all the British reprints exactly as they were printed when released.<br />The vinyls are 180 grams and pressed fine (someone earlier said they weren't).<br />The book inside is the highlight. Printed up beautifully, thick pages, hardcover and goes along with the albums as you play them start to finish. Lots of rare photos.<br /><br />Overall, worth the money. Very happy with this. I'm sure if it was a $600 box set there would be more bells and whistles and pressed on a 200+ gram vinyl etc.... but for a middle class income, this was perfect.<br /><br />Never have to buy another Beatles album again.<br />(I guess that's more than 7 sentences)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Needs to load more updates.  It only loads ten and then it's just blank.  Not the full version.  Please update son.  Thank you
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Due to the most convoluted POS redemption system possible, getting the digital album and digital comic book posed more of a challenge than expected. However getting the digital copy of the movie was easy thanks to iTunes (why can't other companies be this easy to work with?). After you get through all the BS, then you still need to download a Marvel app to read the digital comic book (why couldn't I just get a simple PDF download?)<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great film with great extras. You get both the 3D and 2D versions of the blu-ray, as well as the DVD. Plus a digital copy for use with either Apple or Google products (iTunes/iOS or Android). The digital album is all MP3s at 312-319 kbps (VBR). Although a constant bit rate would be better than variable, it's still a pretty decent bit rate.
B00A12VJZM|4.0|Quite a few of the songs are edited short. No need for that. Otherwise a good value for the six bucks I paid.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Kind of difficult to angle the Kindle Fire to take a photo, however, it takes pretty good pictures.  Good Luck and have fun.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Best book by Clancy in a long time (perhaps the credit should go to Greany).  Bottom line - it is a triumph in collaboration.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I could literally play this all day! Does what it says and a great price. I think you have to pay for my story's within the game. But I think it's worth it!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Toby did a wonderful job on this one also. The special effects were great and the cast did and excellent job
B005I4JG80|4.0|The book was great. I feel like Americans have turned a bit soft when it comes to raising children. This book has given me confidence to be a little tougher. I will definitely be thinking \\"what would a French woman do\\"!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Spiderman is a great character for all the right reasons.  Toby is a good fit for this role. The action and special effects are great.
B000002JEV|5.0|This is one of their finest live recordings available. This album is a necessity for any real Zeppelin fan. Page's amazing solo's and Bonham's pounding of the drums make for an amazing record.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Loved it.<br />Cute, funny & touching.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />++++++++++++++++++++<br />++++++++++++++++++<br />++<br />+++<br />+++<br />+++<br />+++<br />++<br />+<br />+<br />+<br />+<br /><br />+
B000JQUKKU|5.0|To me required reading at Christmas to get into that festive feeling, forget the grinch Ebenezer Scrooge is the real Bah, Humbug
B007SGM084|3.0|Overall, I really enjoyed the series. A relatively minor complaint is that it was highly repetitive (sex, talk, anger, sex, talk, happy, sex, talk, anger...), but I think that was what the author was going for. The frequent sex, according to the book, was because that was how Christian communicated his emotions until he was able to finally open up and speak freely to Ana near the end.<br />However, I feel the books were highly overrated and I agree with others that I probably would have been happier if I saved my money and just borrowed the books from a friend. Another complaint I have is that I feel the second and third books tried to hard to fit drama in. For example....did they really need to have Ana's father get into a car accident when it didn't relate to the plot at hand?<br /><br />Also...in the third book there is a section where Ana and Christian go back to work after their weekend in Aspen and exchange e-mails. They e-mail talking about their plans for the evening, and then, without any transition they start e-mailing about how they enjoyed their plans. Now....is that the way it is really meant to be written in the books or did the editor just get lazy with the e-book addition????? If someone could enlighten that for me, I would appreciate it.<br /><br />In summation, definitely worth a read if you are looking for something to pass the time....but don't read it if you are looking for much more than simply an easy read to wind down your day that is remarkably similar to a daytime soap opera. I'm still waiting for Ana to discover she has an evil twin if they change their mind and move from a trilogy to a four book series. ;)
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I went to see what the hint does. I tried the hint 2 times and it worked fine. The third time I asked for 5 more hints and the system stopped with a blank screen. I no longer can use my hints.<br /><br />This game is very enjoyable so I live without the hints.<br /><br />I very seldom use the hints, only to move the game along. I would not recommend this product because of the hint problem. There should be other products out there that \\"connects the dots\\" without errors.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|The tinkerbell adventure continues with this latest movie. The movie is very good and my girls loved it. Some good lessons/morals are learned in the movie about working together and helping each other.
