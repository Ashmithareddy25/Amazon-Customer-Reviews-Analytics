6304711891|5.0|No doubt this is one of the best action movies ever.  The music combined with Connery's and Cage's performance's, this movie is hard to beat.  There's not much i can say about this film b/c when i saw it, it blew me  away with all that gas chemical stuff.  But I love this movie and I'll  always remember it. No movie will ever take the place of this one!
0767824571|3.0|This DVD does nothing to take advantage of the DVD format.  There are only a few trailers, which I'm sure come on the video.  A dissapointing translation of a wonderful film.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This movie will always remain a classic for all time.  I don't see how Spielberg does it, but he does.  This is one of those movies that it doesn't matter how many times it comes on, it's good everytime.  It's like  i'm watching it for the 1st time everytime i see it over and over again.   Now that's when u know if a movie is worth buying or calling a classic.   And this movie is a classic!   No doubt about it.  The horror and suspense  that Spielberg creates is incredible and no one can do it like him.  I  don't have this movie but i've watched it so many times it feels like i  have it.  Anyway, enough rambling, just go out and see it.
B000002TWN|5.0|I can't be as articulate as all the other reviews; I can only say this album is incredible.  It'll move you and soothe you down to the essence of your being.  D'Angelo is a genius, and this is music at its best.  After  hearing this album, I'm liking Voodoo and I'll probably have to get the  live album too!  Trust me, there's NO WAY you'll be disappointed.
0394718283|5.0|The Continental Op, an anonymous agent of the Continental Detective Agency, comes to corrupt Personville (aka Poisonville) and investigates a series of murders.  In succession he confronts the murder of the publisher of the local paper, the murder of the police chief's brother, and the murder of a beautiful woman.  The publisher's father, convinced that local gangsters are responsible for his son's death, employs the Op to break up the organized crime stranglehold on Personville.  The Continental Op determines that he cannot quickly destroy the crimelords by lawful means, so he decides to work outside the law to destroy them.  The murder of the police chief's son provides him with a golden opportunity to maneuver the rival gangs into lethal conflict. During these investigations, peripheral characters drop like flies as rival gangs feud over turf.  The Continental Op continues his investigations, stirs up strife among the gangs, and tries to elude arrest himself as the dance of death lumbers to its bloody denouement.  It is near impossible to keep an accurate bodycount through the course of the novel.  Despite the carnage, the detective work is excellent, the intrigue is gripping, and the mysteries are satisfying.<br />This book inspired three movies: Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; the Clint Eastwood oater &quot;A Fistful of Dollars,&quot; and the Bruce Willis prohibition era epic &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot; I haven't seen &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; but the Eastwood and Willis movies hardly compare to &quot;Red Harvest&quot; for complexity and character development.  They accentuate the bloodshed and virtually ignore everything else.
0783222734|5.0|Best movie ever made, you don't feel FX comes in,  and you just feel the vicious monster creeps in, slowly, and slowly, and slowly.....a masterpiece made by all filmmakers.
6304711891|5.0|&quot;The Rock&quot; is yet another great Bruckenheimer movie, perhaps his best (although that is debatable because of &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; would give it a run for its money).<br />&quot;The Rock&quot; features top notch  actors, something that is usually lacking in action flicks.  Instead of  lunchbox actors like Keanu Reeves, we get Ed Harris, Nicholas Cage and Sean  Connery.  The scenes in which Connery &amp; Harris appear together are  almost electric - both have such an authoritative screen presence.  Micheal  Biehn once again plays a Seal, although this time it is a much better role  than the one he was given in that rather silly movie called &quot;Navy  Seals.&quot;<br />One of the things I liked best about this movie is its  depiction of Special Forces.  I hate it when Hollywood makes elite fighting  groups (such as Navy Seals, Green Berets, Ninjas, etc.) look like a bunch  of incompetent buffoons.  &quot;The Rock&quot; features one of the most  favorable portayals of Marine Recon and Navy Seals that I have ever seen.<br />Now, to dispel some of the criticism of the movie that I have read.  Is  some of this movie unbelievable?  Of course it is.  It's an action movie.  It's not meant to be taken too seriously.  It is entertaining and delivers  on its promise of non-stop action.  You have everything from Marine Recon  vs. Navy Seals to a good  car chase which involves a Ferrari to an Air  Force air-strike, + a whole lotta neat stuff getting blown up.  It is also  about as plausible as action movies get.<br />This is a great movie for all  those who have even a passing appreciation for action movies. It's also a  &quot;must&quot; movie for DVD to get all the full effect of the sights and  sounds.
B00003CXFV|4.0|will she (Julia Roberts)win an oscar or not.Like a few others I know I can see her or not.This time I choose to see what a lot of people knew,that she can act.At first you think this is the usual story,girl with  heart,poor,single,alone.Enter man on bike called George,( Aaron  Eckhart).Then theres the laywer Ed Masry(Albert Finney).Gruff hard boiled  but again has a kind heart under that bull interior.Story true, little  people take on the large corperation this time a water company.Roberts give  something more than playing the part of this heroine,she shows herself.This  is her picture all the way and the surporting cast is execellent,although  you don't see Eckhart or Finney alot they suport Roberts though out this  film.Even though the water company is the villian, you have a smaller one  played by another fine actor name         who is ask to come in by Finney  and help take the case the rest of the way.Roberts is both excellent and  frustrated by this out landish plan.She shows that she may look a tart but  she really has no label on her.Those that are to yet get to watch this  amazing film should not wait for the video or dvd,pay the money and  enjoy.IF THE ACCADEMY want to give there oscar to the best acctress then  please let them give to Miss Julia Roberts.
0790729628|5.0|&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is, in my mind, one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time.  The movie takes place in the early part of the 21st century.  Harrison Ford plays a cop whose job it is to track down  illegal artificial life forms called &quot;replicants.&quot;  So, sounds  like just another action /  beat-em up / shoot-em up, right?  Wrong.<br />This  movie is not an action movie.  It is, if anything, a drama.  It deals with  the 20th century postmodern condition and has many philosophical  implications.  For one, it deals with the rights of artificial life forms  and what, exactly (if anything?) distinguishes them from us;  something  that is not far fetched at all considering the horrifying technology we are  right on the brink of having in regards to microbiology and gene  manipulation.<br /> The sets are lavish &amp; have a haunting, gothic feel to  them.  The acting, with Harrison Ford in the lead, is top notch.  This is  one of the few movies where I can say that Sean Young turned in a credible  performance.  Also, the soundtrack is by Vangelis;  it is  subtle....stirring....perfect for this movie.<br />This is a movie I would  highly recommend to ANYONE who lives in this day &amp; age of scientific  marvels &amp; their potential hideous consequences.  Even if you don't like  science fiction, per-se, this movie is worth watching at least once.
B00000J2KR|5.0|The first time I saw Barry Lyndon the greatness of the film didn't quite sink in.  I though &quot;oh, that's nice.  good cinematography and authenticity.&quot;  But later on it began to grow on me.  I've watched it  five times now and I love this film more than ever.  The magestic beauty of  every single shot in the film ranks with Remington masterpieces.  The  authenticity, pacing and brilliant arangement of score create an auditory  and visual symphony perfecty coreographed to draw in a careful veiwer.   Kubrick always keeps his story the first priority however.  Thackery wrote  Lyndon as an adventure.  But Kubrick moderizes the theme to display the  absolute decadedence of an era.  Watch the artist at the peak of his  career.  Barry Lyndon is second only to 2001.
630528069X|5.0|This is one of the landmark movies in action movie history.  It set the foundation for so many other movies that came after it.  &quot;Under Siege&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; are two movies which were in many  ways replicates of this thriller.<br />&quot;Die Hard&quot; was Bruce Willis'  breakthru flick as far as the box office is concerned.  Instead of an  attitude-laden wise guy, Willis plays a New York cop who just wants to lead  a simple life &amp; has no wish to be a hero.  However, he gets caught up  in hostage situation in an L.A. skyscraper.  From that point on, Willis'  character must fight off the bad guys by himself while the F.B.I. and LAPD  are more interested in making him the scapegoat of the whole  debacle.<br />&quot;Die Hard&quot; does not let up on the amount of action  &amp; has no real dry spells where nothing is going on.  In fact, action  wise, it has probably the most &quot;punch&quot; of any action picture ever  made.  The 2nd &quot;Die Hard&quot; is o.k., the 3rd one is absurd &amp;  silly.  However, the original is by far the best &amp; will forever remain  an classic for those who love an adrenilene rush along w/their popcorn.
B00004SCX6|2.0|People of the world, let's face it. Britney can't sing. Little nine year old minds will be damaged forever upon the listening of this. The only 2 decent songs on the whole cd are Lucky(I wonder if that's how she feels but  I think she too blessed), and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know(Mutt Lange  is a songwriting genius and Britney HAD to butcher a creation of his). I've  heard bad remakes but this rivals all. NO ONE SHOULD EVER CHANGE THE LYRICS  TO A CLASSIC SONG LIKE SATISFACTION, ARGUABLY THE BEST POP SONG EVER! The  titanic blowoff was so inane on Oops. And besides, Britney has said in  interviews that she doesn't really relate to what she's(supposedly)  co-written in Dear Diary. I really don't get that. People write songs to  express their feelings and opinions, not because an industry makes them. I  think she co-wrote it to shut up all her critics(and God there's a lot of  them). If you want to hear a nice song named Dear Diary, get a copy of  M2M's Shades of Purple. FYI:They are not the same lyrics. Britney has  promoted herself as a &quot;real girl&quot;. Sorry sister, you are only as  real as your implants and there is music by better artists who deserve more  attention (see above). I give her credit for the good stuff.
B00003CXDU|3.0|Most people who have seen `Galaxy Quest' probably have never seen a science fiction convention before, well take from someone with first hand knowledge, it was pretty much like what you saw on the big screen. Large  rooms filled with frothing fanboys dressed as Vulcans or Klingons, and  those are the guys who run the dealer tables, over priced merchandise that  you could have found at your local comic shop for half the price, crammed  into too small lecture halls watching 9th generation copy of Urutskodoji,  or a chance to meet the guy who almost played the stand in for Patrick  Stewart in episode 406 of Star Trek: The Next Humiliation. And perhaps  worst of all, the fans themselves, who care more about how warp drive works  than personal hygiene.<br /> The horror. The horror.<br /> `Galaxy Quest'  is a good-natured poke at science fiction fandom, which is good, because  there are a lot of good things about fandom, having met many good friends  at conventions, seen wonderful costumes by very passionate and talented  people, and engaged in some very good discussions and debates with some  very smart people. In `Galaxy Quest', Tim Allen place Jason Nesbet, the  star of a long since cancelled TV series of the same name that has a very  loyal following of fans, and like Stat Trek, just can't let the series die.  Allen is joined by Sigourney Weaver in a grey and red jump suit with blonde  hair...the single best part of the film, as burnt out actors who attend  these conventions, sometimes as their only means of making money. (Not  really a joke, check to see how much James Doohan makes for appearing at a  World Con.)<br /> All of the actors are upset at Nesbet as his ego spirals  out of control and he ends up alienating most of his fellow cast members  (are we paying attention Mr. Shatner?). they gripe about him always getting  the girl, always getting to take his shirt off, that is until they find  themselves aboard a very real working replica vessel of the one they used  in the TV series and fighting a very real war. Built by aliens who received  transmissions of the show and believed them to be historical documents,  they rebuilt everything they saw on the show, even the massive starship  Protector (incidentally, the `NTE' in `NTE-3120' stands for `Not The  Enterprise'), against a race of reptilian alien uglies who want to destroy  this nice alien race who built all of this great stuff because,...well,  that's not important. Strangely, the film actually pulls itself together as  a friendship piece. Did I just write that?<br /> Sometimes I got the  feeling that they writers really wanted to take some gut shots at fandom,  other times the jabs were well meaning and flattering. It also becomes  apparent that the series endures because of the fans (something Paramount  has never learned about Star Trek. How many web sites have they closed?).  `Galaxy Quest' has some honestly funny moments, but where it falls apart is  the editing, which comes across as very unprofessional with one bad take  leading into another. The special effects, (ILM again), are first rate,  even the stuff they did as out takes from the old series had a nice period  look to them. The NTE-Protector is actually quite beautiful, with just a  hint of Enterprise for inspiration. A great film? No. A good one? Yes. Mel  Brooks' `Spaceballs' did it first and did it better.
B00004RYZT|5.0|If you already love Rammstein or heavy metal in general buy this. Actually,I have shown this to friends that weren't into this kind of music and they still raelly enjoyed it. Some reviewers have complained that at  times the performers just stand still when playing their instruments.Who  cares?This is a group of musicians who are all,according to the interview  on the disc,around 30 years old.Their music in concert is possibly even  better than on the CD's.Besides the fact that I think that standing  perfectly still while playing really awesome,fast guitar riffs looks kind  of cool,I would rather watch these guys occasionally stand still and play  great live music than watch some generic boy-band bee-bop all around the  stage while lip-synching every line.The extras on this disc are cool  too.Quizzes,an interview,a hidden video to &quot;Stripped&quot;,but the  main reason to buy this is just because RAMMSTEIN RULES!
6305177473|5.0|Since I first saw the original movie, I have been a diehard fan of The Parent Trap.  When I heard Disney was remaking the film, I thought why mess with a classic.  I must say, though, that this Parent Trap is a classic as  well.  Yes, some things from the original did not survive (such as the  wonderful chemistry between the parents, the entire &quot;Let's Get  Together&quot; sequence, and the lovable Reverend Mosby); however, some  aspects were greatly improved upon (the accents, the perfectly evil fiance,  and the relationships between the twins and their butlers).  Most  importantly, the later version maintains the essence of the original story,  that of twin girls scheming to reunite their divorced parents.  Besides  these pluses, the movie is perfectly cast, the music is wonderful, and the  scenery is lovely.<br />My four-year-old would watch this movie everyday, if I  allowed her too.  It is a great movie for the entire family.  Even though  it is about girls, boys (my husband included) enjoy watching the movie as  much as girls do.  The only bad thing about this movie and the original,  too, is that it gives hope to many divorced children that their parents  will be reunited.  For some children though, they need that hope.<br />My  advice is to buy this movie as well as the original.  If you can pick a  favorite of the two, you must be a more decisive person than I am.
B00000K2UX|5.0|The  only thing I want to say is the  song: TAKE MY BREATH AWAY, MEMORIES,  AND  SITTIN ON THE DOCK OF THE  BAY, THIS ARE THE  BEST SONGS I EVER HEARD,  is a &quot; WELL DONE JOB&quot;                        YEE-HAAH!!!!!
B000002KH3|5.0|This is one incredible, explosive, debut album from one of the pioneer  bands of heavy metal.  From the moment it starts to the moment it ends, the  power and the fun never stops.  Too bad it's only 35 minutes.  &quot;Eruption&quot; has got to be one of the most incredible pieces of  guitar work I have ever heard.  It more than shows the incredible prowess  of the great Eddie Van Halen, just before launching into one of the most  awesome covers of all time, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;.  Just amazing.  The thrash metal genre owes as much to these guys as Judas Priest and Iron  Maiden.  The guitar playing on this CD is just phenomenal.  I only wish I'd  been alive to witness the release of this debut, but unfortunately, it was  five years before I was born.  However, as great as the musicianship is on  this album, it's a shame the songwriting isn't better than it is, but oh  well, the music more than makes up for it.  Well, anyway, if you've never  heard this album, you've got to check it out as soon as possible, it is  just great.  Oh, and if you like these guys, you would probably like Iced  Earth.  Peace.
0060977493|1.0|The God of small things is really no masterpiece as publishers make it out to be. The story is meant to be the world view of a child. Unfortunately because of poor narration capability of the author the whole story leaves  you confused and cold. There is some potential in the tale no doubt, but  the treatment is really not too good. Then what happens?  To the reader it  will just seem like mysterious characters coming in and going out with no  flow evr happening. As someone pointed out this seems more like diary  writing. At times there are some exotic descriptions. But good god !  This  is not enough to make you read the whole thing... My advice is read the  reviews, not the book! That way you will be saved of disappointment!
B00003CWLE|5.0|Usually all the Hollywood movies are English speaking films. Like &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, it's seems that every Chinese can speak excellent English. In this film, every dialougue in English is reasonable.  No English between Thais. It's a remarkable improvement. In &quot;Chasing  the Red October&quot;, There's no reason for the Russians talk to each  others in English especially the beginning of the movie they are talking in  Russian. Today in US or elsewhere, Chinese would only speak in Chinese to  their Chinese friends even they can speak good English.<br />The director take  everything in serious. That makes the movie seems closer to the reality  than any other Anna films before. We can compare it with the unforgettable  &quot;The longest day&quot; and &quot; Tora Tora Tora&quot; that the  different languages used in the films makes them a trusted documentary-feel  movies. Just compared the &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; and &quot;The War of  Mid-way Island&quot; you can see the different between a Hollywood Classics  and a Hollywood productions.<br />&quot;Anna and the King&quot; has got the  ambition to be another Hollywood Classics and they nearly made it . The  only thing upsets the film lovers is they don't get any Important Academy  Awards last years. &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; didn't take any important  Oscars, but it  still took 7 minor ones. And what's &quot;Anna and the  King&quot; gets?<br />Though I expect Jodie Foster for more, she has already  done a great Job. The feeling is similar to when I bought John Lennon's  &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; in 80 before his death. I didn't like the album,  cos' I expected for more. However, it became one of my favourite album for  I know I didn't accept a more human John Lennon when I listened to the  album at the first time. For &quot;Anna and the King&quot;. I didn't like  the performance of Jodie at the first time. And after I watch it again, I  find that Jodie is not Jodie, she is Anna. Anna is not any role Jodie act  before (maybe the first middle age role for Jodie). What she handled about  the deep passion between Anna and the King is so well that she really came  to another class of Art. The love without physical touch is so hard to  perform and both Jodie and Chow Yun-Fat has done a perfect work. You can  recognise their love only through their eyes. No touch, no kiss and even no  words of promises, however, we find what we call &quot;Eternal  Love&quot;.<br />There's no surprise for me to find how well Chow Yun-Fat  performs in the movie.  I saw every TV programmes and movies by him (He's  not just a Action Hero). He performed perfect even in some really Bad  films. If you like his performance, try  the coming &quot;The Crouching  Tigers and Hidden Dragon&quot; and you'll love it. The film has already  shown in Hong Kong and it's another Classics in the movie  history.<br />Besides the excellent performance of the actors, everything in  the movie is close to perfect. It's worth to see the movie just for the  rebulit of the Palace and the wardrobe. I would like to give 4 and a half  stars for the movie .
B00000AOUD|5.0|What &quot;Tommy&quot; was to the Who, &quot;Thick is a Brick&quot; is to  Jethro Tull.  An epic poem set to progressive rock music.  <br />All right,  Acqualung may be more popular.  But, if you are looking for true musical  and lyrical genius, then search no further than &quot;Thick as a  Brick.&quot;  <br />Not only are you treated to Thick as a Brick.  But, you  also get a live version of the song and an interview with Ian and the boys.   This is a great buy for this fantastic CD.  <br />Highly recommended!
B00004T9UF|5.0|this cd is cool because it has awesome lyrics and eminem is the best rapper.don't be offended by it because most of the stuff he says is just joking.
B000000WF9|5.0|This is a very powerful, enjoyable soundtrack.  24 songs in all, although  they all seem to flow together quite nicely. Many songs are sub 2:00 in  length.  Nyman has produced classics in the past and does so again here.   The music does a great job of capturing the highs and lows of the (great)  film without overpowering it.

0684867621|4.0|Actually 4.5 stars. This is King nearly at his best. For any other author it would be a 5 star, but I know what King is capable of. He does a  wonderful job making you feel the tension and fear this little girl is  feeling. This is work is tight and focused (not an extra word that isn't  needed, which to be honest was one of things King has seemed to have  trouble with.) This along with his other recent works reaffirms him as a  master of storyteller. Pick it up, I doubt you'll be disappointed
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one hell of an album. The songs on this are melodic while still packing the power of thrash metal, the lyrics are well written &quot;For a hill men would kill, why they do not know&quot;-from For Whom the Bell  Tolls, the instrumental work is top notch (check out the guitar solos on  Ride the Lightning and Call of Ktulu), and you also have the slower, more  acoustic Fade to Black. If you enjoy this check out all of Metallica's  stuff up until ...And Justice for All. Now to the songs.<br />Fight Fire with  Fire: Good acoustic intro going into an incredibly fast rhythm guitar and  drums. An excellent song that packs a big wallop and is very  explosive.<br />Ride the Lightning: The first half of this song is average, as  are the lyrics, but the second half is great kicking off with an awesome  guitar solo.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: Excellent song with lots of power,  the riff is very good and the lyrics are too.<br />Fade to Black: Very good  song, acoustic first half is very good, the lyrics adress suicide and  descending into depression. The second half is also excellent with an great  descending staccato riff to kick it off, with this song they proved they  are not mindless metalheads.<br />Trapped Under Ice: Decent fast song, with  decent lyrics, not a real standout like most of the songs here.<br />Escape:  Not really that good, this is the only song that seems like and album  filler.<br />Creeping Death: Great fast song- about the plague of the  first-born that went through Egypt. Explosive and fast, another awesome  song.<br />Call of Ktulu: My favorite song by Metallica, and on this album. In  essence a metal symphony, great guitar solo, great intro, great riff,  incredible power chord ending, metal doesn't get any better.<br />In  conclusion if you like heavy metal, get this, you can't go wrong. This is  the best metal album of all time, second only to Master of Puppets.<br />BTW:  If you have a big stereo, it is awesome hearing Hetfield yell &quot;DIE, BY  MY HAND, I CREEP ACROSS THE LAND, KILLING FIRSTBORN MAN&quot;<br />Bye people,  remember what metal was and truly is.
B000002HAF|5.0|There really isnt much I can say about the Pixies that hasnt been said by countless fans before me.  Their music is incredibly raw, their lyrics almost incoherent.  Yet somehow beyond all the walls of noise there exists  a strange kind of magic that few bands achieve.  Once you listen to this CD  a few times the walls of sound will slowly break down to reveal some  seriously hard hitting material.  Perhaps it is not for everyone, but I  certainly recomend you give them a try.
0440219078|2.0|I did not like this book very much because well it did not makesence to me because well it was not a good book. I would not reccomendit to anyone no matter what because well i think they will not like it. I did not like the ending it just ended and it did not make sence to me. I liked how they decribed the community and how they decribed the memories Jonas recived and the memories Giver had of his past and other things like that. I liked Asher Jonas's bestfriend and Fioena too and i liked how they decribed Gabe in the book and how they decribed Gabes eyes how Gabe looked a little like Jonas. The other characters in the book were Lilly and mother and father and the old people that Jonas knew and the commity of elders and every one that he knew.

B00004HYLF|5.0|I found a tape of Return to Forever seventeen years ago in a cutout bin. I had no idea who or what they were; I liked the cover and the price was cheap. I'm still listening, only updated on cd. You can't get better  playing than on this album. Lenny White is worth the price alone. Stanley  Clarke holds down the bottom end and intertwines with everyone. Chick  Corea, who was the impetous for the band, keeps everything cohesive. Even  Al DiMeola-who's solo projects and other band projects I do not  like-maintains my interest unfledgingly. This is great instrumental fusion  that is made better because of the remastered cd.
0790734249|5.0|F Murray Abraham plays Salieri just the way the director planned it!  I say this because I don't know how much of Amadeus is historically acurate, but I consider it an entertaining portrayal.  I found the costumes for the  era (18th century) authentic.  Tom Hulce plays the scatterbrain genius  Mozart (portrayed as goofy and childish)and Salieri is portrayed as overly  serious, self-righteous and insanely jealous.  The music is of course the  main highlight with excerpts from The Magic Flute, The Marriage of Figaro,  Don Giovanni, and A Little Night Music.  If you love the music of Mozart,  you will be entertained by this movie and captivated by the soundtrack.       Also recommended: The Amadeus soundtrack on Fantasy records
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is very good. It is very catchy, but most of it is &quot;listen to it once&quot; music- you aren't inclined to hit the repeat button. But all of the songs stand out in some way. <br />Track 1- Oops!... I Did It Again-  Very catchy. Everyone's heard it, so I won't start.<br />Track 2- Stronger-  Kind of corny, but all in all a good beat and like &quot;Oops&quot;,  extremely catchly.<br />Track 3- Don't Go Knockin...- An R&amp;B flavor we  haven't seen from Britney before. Good beat, and Britney does a good job of  singing a pitiful song.<br />Track 4- (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction- A good  cover of a classic, but the snare part is over-stressed. A respectable  remake.<br />Track 5- Don't Let Me Be...- A country song from Shania Twain and  her husband, Britney handles it very well. She could continue into country,  but she's better in pop.<br />Track 6- What U See (Is What U Get)- Sounds too  much like &quot;Oops!&quot;, but a good song all in all.<br />Track 7- Lucky-  At first I couldn't stand this song, but I listened to it and started to  like it. The video is cool too with Britney guiding Lucky through her  life.<br />Track 8- One Kiss From You- Bubblegumish (is that a word?) pop that  is good, but should have been on BOMT and &quot;Sometimes&quot; on  Oops.<br />Track 9- Where Are You Now- I can't even begin to describe how  awesome this song is. Britney has conquered the high notes in this song and  has shown her improvement. This song has to be listened to all the time.  The one repeatable song on the CD.<br />Track 10- Can't Make You Love Me- A  cool, lite song with freestanding lyrics that just flow with the  music.<br />Track 11- When Your Eyes Say It- Another song I hated at first,  now I love. A good song once you get past the Britney talking part. As  scary as it is, the song is respectable.<br />Track 12- Dear Diary- Thank God  Britney did not write this song alone. Now I can't nblame her totally for  it. A waste of a track, but Britney should work on her songwriting before  she does any more of it.<br />This CD is a must have for anyone who likes or  even respects pop music!
B000005RFL|5.0|This is easily the best Sabbath album.  The songs &quot;Sabbath Bloody  Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Killing Yourself to Live&quot;, and &quot;Looking For  Today&quot; are awesome.  Everyone knows that Paranoid is a great album,  but this one is even greater.  On this one, the songs are remastered and  never sounded better.  Don't waste your money are the US version, it sounds  horrible.  It also includes all the original artwork--something very  important for us collectors.  I waited too long to buy album, so don't make  my mistake.
078401213X|5.0|This film is an exploration of textures featuring chiaroscuro bi-products of its black and white film technique. It also features some great computer filtering processes and editing. <br />Aside form being completely  UN-Hollywood (and all the better for it, regardless of what any other  reviews say), it takes the viewer through a certain set of motions in a  certain sequence to achieve a certain effect. That effect being an  atmosphere of chaos, cathexis, frustration and paranoia. Disney, this  ain't!<br />Perhaps, the reason some reviewers didn't enjoy PI, has to do with  exactly that. They called it amateurish and shallow, with a storyline that  is more befitting of a poorly executed art film, but I beg to differ. There  are a few things that in the case of PI, absolutely PRECEDE the content of  the storyline. Those things are: Composition, Design, Texture, and  Depth.  These are elements that, as a viewer, affect your reaction to ABSTRACT  pieces. These are elements that allow you to completely divorce the visuals  from any linear coherence your mind may have been searching for. For me the  storyline was inconsequential.<br />If you watch the film with this in mind,  you are certainly going to enjoy going for a ride into a black and white  abyss of textures and shapes. Think of it as looking into a moving  Kandinsky-Picasso-Dali-Klee-Itten-VanGoh-Munsch collage. It is absolutely  insane. GREAT!
0783242808|3.0|When watchin this video I was laughing! Which was surprising, considering I DO NOT have a sense of humor. I believe that its grotesque black humor got to me and I found that fascinating. I definetly recommend this video to  other people, ages 09-90! It is a must see for the whole family, and  provides about two and a bit hours of entertainment for all! ENJOY
B00000J7J4|3.0|Although the quintessential Santana can be found in this album if one searches long enough, it does take a keen eye to peer through the junk deposited by Mathews, Thomas and others.  This album is not true Santana -  it is another example of corporately produced music written for purposes  other than our own.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I have only had this cd for about a week. One of my friends told me about them so I bought it. At first I was unimpressed; but the more I listened the better it got. Rage is now my most likly favorite band and would  recomend this CD to any one.
0440234743|4.0|Having read other Grisham books that are easy reading summer fare, I was surprised by the turn of the book midway through the story.  It stopped being about law and lawyers.  It became instead a  journey of questioning  and finally redemption for the main character.  I found the book much more  thought provoking than other Grisham books. And thus very pleasantly  surprised.  A must read for anyone going through their own mid-life or  spirtual crisis.

B000002X4T|5.0|Even in '69 there were critics who were skeptical about this album and where the Airplane was headed.  Rich rock stars, it was argued, couldn't possibly revolutionaries (although they could still be &quot;outlaws in the  eyes of America,&quot; I suppose).  That kind of criticism reflected the  growing paranoia among those elements of society we used to call the  &quot;counterculture.&quot;  If you think 90s style &quot;political  correctness&quot; is a drag, you should have lived through the &quot;more  revolutionary than thou&quot; late 60s.<br />Sensitive to the criticism, the  Airplane answered that they were just r'n'r journalists--reporting the news  and reflecting the culture around them.  And to make sure everyone knew not  to take them all that seriously, they put a life size peanut butter and  jelly sandwich on the inside cover gatefold.<br />Well, after 30 years the  debate seems a bit nitpicky.  Musically, Volunteers holds up very well  indeed, and that's really all that matters. The politically themed anthems  (the opener &quot;We Can Be Together,&quot; &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;  and  the closer title track) catch fire vocally and instrumentally.  Grace and  Marty engage in their patented vocal dueling (as opposed to simple  &quot;duetting&quot;) for what was to be the last time until Marty rejoined  the Starship in the mid-70s.  Kantner had yet to succumb to extreme  heavy-handedness.  And Kaukonen and Casady rocked mightily.  By this  record, their producers had finally figured out how to record the band, so  that Casady's bass wasn't buried.<br />What may have been considered lesser  tracks (Jorma's version of the traditional &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; and  Marty's &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;) are now among my favorites.  These  songs and Grace's two exercises in obscurantism (&quot;Hey Frederick&quot;  and &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;) are anything but overtly political.  The  Airplane was never a one-note act; they were always all over the map  musically and lyrically.  Once you realize that it becomes easy to just  &quot;go ride the music.&quot;
6304698542|4.0|Well, if you HAVE to 'sit alone in your room', why not watch 'Cabaret'?  I saw this movie again for the first time in many years, and I was bowled over by Bowles! Although the 'Sally Bowles' of 'Cabaret' has little in  common with the very English character of Christopher Isherwood's original  books, Liza Minnelli nevertheless delivers the finest performance of her  career as the 'divinely decadent' cabaret singer, caught up in a Berlin at  the VERY worst time.  For viewers who don't enjoy musicals because of the  implausible 'bursting into song', 'Cabaret' confines all its musical  numbers to the stage of 'The Kit-Kat Club', so 'Cabaret' works absolutely  as a 'straight' narrative, too. Much more than a tale of a kooky girl and  her gay best friend, 'Cabaret' has a very dark, very chilling subtext, and  the final shot of a swastika on the arm of an anonymous patron of 'The  Kit-Kat Club' sends a shiver down the spine as we realise the horrific   consequences awaiting - not only the characters in 'Cabaret' - but the rest  of the world.
B000001FXR|5.0|The Island releases by Bob Marley and the Wailers are often dismissed by  hardcore reggae purists as &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;rock-and-reggae&quot;  compromises. While there may be some merit in that argument, there is  simply no denying Catch A Fire -- by ANY standard, this is a landmark  achievement.<br />This album finds the original Wailers -- Marley, Tosh and  Bunny -- at their driven, inspired best. It's impossible to pick a  highlight; just isn't a weak song in the lot, and each member contributes  some of his all-time bests. Personal favorites include the soaring, moving  &quot;Slave Driver&quot; -- for my money, the best reggae single of all  time -- and the absolutely rockin' &quot;Midnight Ravers.&quot; It's ALL  here, though. Pop fans will love the slinky &quot;Stir it Up&quot; and  &quot;Kinky Reggae,&quot; the political &quot;400 Years&quot;  and&quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; find the Wailers dishing out some of their  most pointed barbs against oppression, and &quot;Baby We've Got a  Date&quot; features a delightful western steel guitar solo -- completely  unexpected, but so natural you'll wonder why it never caught on.<br />For  anyone whose a fan of Bob Marley, the Wailers, reggae, or just superbly  crafted music, this disc is a must.
B00003CXDU|2.0|&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; ALMOST makes it; the idea of a bunch of has-been actors from a TV Sci-Fi series having to save the universe 'for real' is funny in itself, and Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and the marvellous Alan  Rickman are terrific in their roles as the mis-matched losers forking out a  scant living making personal appearances at Sci-Fi conventions.  However,  once the subtext is established - it is forgotten, and we're left with a  typical 'laser-gun/scary alien/big explotion' type of movie which I feel is  aimed at a younger viewer. The problem with &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is  that it doesn't seem to 'know' its audience; there isn't enough of the  'has-been actor' theme to keep an adult audience laughing, and this idea of  'people past their prime' is lost on youngsters. There are a LOT of clever  ideas and genuinly funny lines in this movie, but they aren't 'played out',  and I can't help but wonder if this has more to do with the Hollywood  obsession with making movies for a 'young audience' to gross as much money  as possible; you feel that the movie has been told to 'hold off' on the  very intelligent subtext and focus on the laser guns!  This is a real  shame, because 'Galaxy Quest' is ALMOST hilarious - but isn't. And that's  no fault of Allen, Weaver, Rickman or the very strong supporting cast.
B000003S0I|5.0|Lark's Tongues in Aspic, is in my opinion KC's masterpiece. The music is highly complex, progressive, way above of what most classic rock bands were doing at the same time. Fripp, Wetton and Brufford, are joined by two  fascinating experimental musicians, that remain nowadays in  &quot;obscurity&quot;: David Cross, who contributed with his enchantig  Violin in two other Crimson albums; and Jamie Muir, whom I would name the  father of experimental percussion, since I am not aware of any (at least  popular) recording, before 1973, using such innovative percussives. I can't  wait for the release of the 24-bit remaster of L'sT Aspic.
6304331851|4.0|Yes, 'Camelot' is a flawed movie, but a MAGICAL one, nonetheless.  It is too long, and Franco Nero's dubbed singing voice as 'Lancelot' is laughable, and YET! Yet, we have RICHARD HARRIS, so perfect as the failing  King Arthur, Vanessa Redgrave, never lovelier than in her role as the torn  Guinavere, and David Hemmings, a dastardly 'mod' Mordred reeking havoc on  the troubled Kingdom.  Franco Nero (dubbing notwithstanding) brings a  wonderful comedic touch to Lancelot, and with the sumptious sets and  costumes, 'Camelot' really is a BEAUTIFUL film.  It has been critisized for  having a 'Sixties' feel to it, but the somewhat hippy-ish design just adds  to the pleasure; and it REALLY doesn't matter that Richard Harris is  wearing WAY to much blue eye-shadow - we're in CAMELOT, for goodness sake!   There may very well be a 'legal limit to the snow' there, but when it comes  to make-up, no holds are barred! Oh, one can pick a MILLION holes in  'Camelot' - but why bother? It's better just to pour yourself a glass of  mead, light some candles, put 'Camelot' in your VCR and let Lerner and  Loewes wonderful score sweep you into a magical time which never existed.   'Camelot' is pure escapism, but it's escapism with 'heart', and that heart  belongs to Richard Harris.  This movie is HIS, and years after first seeing  this movie, when I imagine the face of King Arthur, the face that I see is  Richard Harris'.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is a wonderfully done album.  It was worth the price of the album  just for the acoustic version of &quot;Key to the High Way&quot;. This  album has a great mix of upbeat bluesy songs and laid back &quot;way  down&quot; blues toons that will make your nautghy parts tingle!  I am  praying for a tour together!  I think I could die a happy man after that  concert!
6305161992|5.0|This movie is very well-rounded. You have lots of action, drama, humor and even a bit of a love tale. Brandon's humor really makes the movie more enjoyable, not to mention his style conrasted to Dolph's. Their talents are  really put on display here, this seems to be the most martial arts-  oriented movie either one of them have done, and they do not disappoint. If  you are an action fan, Lee or Dolph fan, this movie is for you. The love  scenes are a little cheesy, but the movie is very good and I never get  bored of watching it over and over again.
B00004TDTO|4.0|You will generally be pleased with this DVD edition of one of the all-time greats for just about everybody. Picture transfer is O.K., and it's great to see it in full wide-screen after all these years; the picture does have  some artifacts in it throughout (those little sparkly things you see on  older films), but its not enough to be distracting, especially after the  shark arrives.  A buyer of this DVD should be prepared for what is not  included:  no director's commentary, writer's commentary, or isolated music  track--all of which seem artistic naturals for this release.  My guess is  they're already planning another release to include more outtakes (there  really weren't all that many) and probably Spielberg's commentary--I notice  they are careful to call this release &quot;Anniversary Collection's  Edition&quot;; I'm sure there will be other versions in the future.  Also,  be prepared for a little odd-ball fact and maybe disappointment related to  the sound:  5.1 sound is just fine, I'm sure.  The stereo, 2-channel  version I found very lacking in depth and separation; and, most notably,  you can't select Dolby Digital Sound (the older 4-channel surround sound)  unless you also choose subtitle captions--this is strange.  Finally, the  picture, with also about 75 minutes of additional features (making of...,  etc.), is dual layer on one side. Sure wish they would give us something on  the other side of these DVDs--even a modified TV version would be  appreciated and a better comsumer value.  But, on balance, DVD is worth the  price.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it--but don't take it near the beach.
B000002UTI|5.0|Well if you want insight into the man and the music of John Lennon, this  is a good one CD purchase.  I know most everybody has all the pieces on the  CD BUT you don't have them all on one representing John's life.  When I  feel I need to remember this man and his work this is the CD that I put on.  It also reminds what happens to a man's work that is left behind.  If you  listen to REAL LOVE on this CD you will understand that the remake of it  for the anthology was totally off the original concept by John.  I think  this is a good compilation of music of his life.
6305807086|2.0|The previews were the best parts of this film. I found the idea behind the story, a mysterious doorway that takes the visitor into the mind of John Malkovich, very intriguing. Coupled with a good cast, the possibilities for  a riveting and funny story abounded. But this movie doesn't carry it  off.<br />Watching John Malkovich play himself is probably the best part of  the film. John Cusack plays an unhappily married (to Cameron Diaz) pupeteer  obsessed with an attractive coworker with whom he partners to sell trips  into the mind of John Malkovich for $200 each.<br />There are some excellent  pupeteering scenes in the film that are enchanting. There are a few laughs  in places, but this is not a side-splitting comedy. The story takes time to  build. We're almost a third of the way through the film before we have our  first encounter with Mr. Malkovich.<br />After this first visit, the story  meanders and plots within subplots appear with the pupeteers wife having a  love affair with the attractive coworker while she occupies John  Malkovich's body. Sounds confusing? It is a little.<br />As the film moves  into the second half, it picks up pace, but it feels rushed. The novelty of  watching John Malkovich play himself wears off and a brief appearance by  Charlie Sheen (also playing himself) does nothing to improve the film.<br />My  advice would be to rent the movie before buying. It's worth watching, in  places, but not if you've got something better to do. I think most people  can happily wait until it appears on TV.

0671027344|5.0|This book was wonderful!  I couldn't pit it down! As I was reading it, I wished many times that I could be Charlie, the main character.  I liked the fact that he had all these friends and a brother and sister.  I really  wanted to be him.  This a good book, for older readers, but a great  coming-of-age book.  If you like &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; then  you will like this, possibly even better.  I liked this better, because I  never really wanted to Holden Caulfied, but as I have said before, I wanted  to be Charlie.  Read it and I guarentee, you won't be disappointed.
0440214041|4.0|This is an alright book.It is no five star book but it is good.The plot is not that good but the way he sweeps you up in this girl and you just want to know what happens to her is a very good read.If you are looking for  Grisham's best this is not it.But if you are looking for a good read then I  recomened this book.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I was going to wait for PlayStation 2 to go DVD but when I saw this package, I had to get one right away.<br />First off, I call this movie the ClockWork Orange for Generation X.  I love the film.  I love the concept.  And, yeah, I'll admit it, I loved the '90s Ultraviolence.<br />The way this  DVD comes together with extensive behind the scenes stuff, cool additional  audio commentary and a great box makes it the best package to date.  All  this and it's a damn good movie.

B000002U8G|5.0|The first song (One of these days) is awesome, great guitars. Fearless just has a mindblowing riff and spectacular melodies.Echoes... what can i say? Echoes was composed of about 40 music ideas.  It is one of my favorite  songs, nice lyrics and a great riff at 18 min and 30 sec. How come the  radio never plays these songs? THanks Floyd for the album.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Metallica does it again, but this time with a symphony.  I must admit that I was skeptical when I first bought this cd, thinking that Metallica would tone down their songs for this event, but I was very wrong.  I can't  imagine how the symphony could keep up with the band on such songs as  &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, but they do plus  they add another dimension to the songs.  My personal favorites are  &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Battery&quot;.  This cd is perfect for a long  time fan of Metallica's or a new fan.  Pick this one up along with the cd  &quot;and justice for all&quot;.
0440234743|2.0|Decent plot and a change from Grisham's ususal formula, but very disappointing.  Too much rambling on and on about characters that he does not make us care about.  Very little dialoge between characters and a very  uninteresting sub plot.  Makes us wait to the last twenty pages for a  glimpse of some excitement only to be let down by an abrupt and  uninteresting ending.  If your looking for mystery, intrigue and juicy  characters this book will be a bitter disappointment.
B0000025RI|5.0|These days Michael Jackson seems to be more of a cartoon character than a  recording artist.  His exploits get more than attention than his music.  Forget that his best friend is a chimpanzee and he lives at a place called  Neverland and just listen to the music. The album crosses across all music  genres and gives the listener a little bit of everything.  There's pop,  rock, r &amp; b and dance rhythms; slow, fast and midtempo songs.  &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot; gets the album moving.  It's a  disco inferno and builds up to a chanting crescendo.  The next two songs  slow things down after the frenzied opening.  One of the two non-singles,  &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; is a nice mid-tempo song and then comes the  superstar duet with Paul McCartney &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;.  The song  shows off both the artist's vocal talents as they trade verses fighting  over a girl's affection.  You can almost see the song as a passing of the  torch from the Beatles to Jackson as the world's biggest act.  The humorous  &quot;Thriller&quot; follows and it contains Vincent Price's debut as a  &quot;rapper&quot;.  &quot;Beat It&quot; is the song that pushed the album  into the cultural phenomenon that it was.  By employing guitar god Eddie  Van Halen on the song, Jackson was able to break out of the mold of an R  &amp; B artist and reach a vast white audience.  Jackson showed he was  able to transcend all labels and reach listeners of all colors and musical  tastes.  The first number one song on the album follows. It was a searing  performance of the song, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, on the Motown 25th  anniversary special that helped show Jackson's amazing dancing abilities  and push album sales into the stratosphere. It was also the first video by  a black artist to gain major airplay on the predominately white MTV,  setting the stage for other black artists like Prince to start reaching a  more diverse audience. &quot;Human Nature&quot; is a pretty ballad and  &quot;P.Y.T.&quot; is has more of a a hard edge. His sister Janet sings  back up on the tune.  The album closes with another ballad &quot;The Lady  In My Life&quot;.  This album went on to sell 25 million copies and for a  long time was the biggest selling album in history.  It almost single  handily pulled the recording industry out of it late 70's, early 80's sales  funk and made MTV into the marketing machine it is today.  It takes a very  special album to do that and this is exactly that.Y.T.&quot; is has more of a a hard edge. His sister Janet sings  back up on the tune.

B000000WA4|5.0|WOW, what an album indeed.  I'd have to say there are 6 of the greatest songs ever recorded on this album ( which includes tonight tonight, zero, bullet with butterfly wings, muzzle, porcelina of the vast oceans, and my  personal favorite song Thru The Eyes of Ruby)not to mention many other  great ones.  <br />The album starts off with a neat classical song Then  begains to rock with slower but still very good songs inbetween.  The  guitar in this album is excellent and so are Corgans vocals.  if you don't  own this album it is a must buy there are songs on here for what ever mood  you are in.  I would have to say the only albums that are as good as this  one are Siamese Dream by the pumpkins, ten and vs. by pearl jam and maybe  nevermind by nirvana.   This album is truely a classic and there is no  contest about this being the best double album ever made
6303314015|5.0|I didn't want to like this movie - I never like the hyped ones - but my 2-year-old HAD to see it, and she's watched it again and again over the last year.

B00004U45G|5.0|A co-worker raved about the Crows/Page concert at Jones Beach Theater.  I  went to Sam Goody during lunch and ironically this Cd was blasting in the  store.  I made the impulse purchase.  It was worth it. Page can still bring  it on guitar.  Ok, I admit it. I have every Zeppelin albumn but as I  suspect is the case with a lot of us, they have dust on them from should I  say ..underuse. Zep is a tough band to cover but I think the Crows do a  fine job of it.  What can I say?  This will probably inspire me to dust off  soime of the good ole Zep cd's and give em a spin....
B000002O1Q|4.0|I have to say that since the movie came out in 1984 and I watched it several times (since I worked for a theatre) the song, This is What It Means to be Young has been my favorite song of all time.  The entire albumn  is worth it because of this song.
0394720288|5.0|They don't write 'em like this anymore! Or if they do, I wanna see them!<br />The pleasantly bewildered Bertie Wooster and his Vulcan valet  Jeeves return to Totleigh Towers, in Totleigh-on-the-Wold (now Wodehouse  KNEW how to make great names) to the house of the Bassets. They must  contend with enormous curate Harold &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, his devious  fiancee Stiffy Byng, the perpetually creepy Sir Watkyn Basset, his  wannabe-Nazi friend Roderick Spode, fish-faced Gussie Fink-Nottle,  and--worst of all--the soppy Madeleine Basset, who constantly believes that  Bertie is madly in love with her.<br />With a cast like that, things are bound  to go wrong. To steel up his courage for fiancee Madeleine, Gussie writes  down degrading things about Sir Watkyn and Spode in a leather notebook--and  promptly loses it. The blackmailing Stiffy Byng takes the notebook and will  give it to Gussie if Bertie convinces her fiancee, Stinker Pinker, to steal  a policeman's helmet.<br />Still here?<br />The characters are caricatures, but  they're GOOD caricatures! Stiffy is almost amoral, the yin to the  conscientious Stinker's yang. Spode is his usual blustering, swaggering  self. Sir Watkyn reminded me of a small yipping dog just waiting to be  squished. Madeleine is still mooning about fairies and bunny rabbits. And  poor Bertie is mixed up with them, an innocent soul in a world of very  strange people.<br />Read the book, and for heaven's sake watch the TV  adaptation!

B000002NHN|5.0|I'm a longtime McKennitt fan. Seeing as how I practically live off Celtic lore, history, and music, how could I not be? This album is highly reminiscent of her previous release, &quot;The Mask and Mirror,&quot; she  incorporates a lot of the same elements. But that doesn't take away from  this release's own high points. &quot;The Highwayman&quot; is fantastic,  more powerful and direct than &quot;The Lady of Shalott.&quot;  &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; has got to rank among her most lovely songs to  date, on par with past masterpieces like &quot;Samhain Night&quot; and  &quot;The Dark Night of the Soul.&quot; I enjoy &quot;The Mummers'  Dance&quot; but it's hardly the masterstroke everyone makes it out to  be.<br />I have read other reviews by other longtime fans who accuse McKennitt  of selling out with this release, just because it reached a wider audience.  Well kids, did Joni Mitchell sell out when she won some Grammys and got  inducted to the Hall of Fame? Did Ani DiFranco sell out when Rolling Stone  wrote an article about her? Hardly. Reaching a wider audience does not  necissitate selling out. She'll sell out when she dissolves Quinlan Road  totally and starts doing Revlon commercials. That's selling out.<br />To  return to the subject at hand, I'd hardly call the album commercial.  There's no such thing as commerical Celtic. But please, other longtimers,  give the lady a break. If you want to accuse someone of selling out, at  least make a valid argument. After all, didn't she strike up a deal with WB  to distribute her material in 1991 with &quot;The Visit?&quot; Hmmm?
B000005DSN|5.0|My jaw dropped when I first listened to it.I liked this album from  beggining to end.Maybe you can find that some songs sound as previous  Stratovarius tunes,but you definitely couldn't call it  &quot;clich&quot;.The guys sound absolutely amazing in this album.The  strongest songs?&quot;Legions&quot;,and the jewel of the  band:&quot;Visions&quot;.Go and get it!!!!!
B000002KY8|5.0|This CD is some of the best funky rock around.  The songs have an irresistible dance flow to them and are hot and steamy.  Prince masters his words and instrumentation on this record.  Before &quot;1999&quot;,  Prince's albums had something brilliant and quirky about them, and finally  this record not only was a hot mix of jams but made a great statement on  the world more than his others.  <br />The party starts off with  &quot;1999&quot;.  The song is a relay of vocal activity until the chorus  where everyone's voices combine in a great mesh.  The frantic and brilliant  guitar and bass keep the track going and while it runs a little longer then  the original, there is nothing long and dragging about the track at all.  A  cool statement on the threat of the world blowing itself up.   <br />&quot;Mommy...why does everyone have a bomb?&quot;<br />Next is another  classic pop gem in Prince's thrown, &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;.  Can  Prince make this wild girl's his and claim her?  Of course!  A great one  night stand song.  Lisa Coleman singing &quot;right to the ground&quot; at  the end just gets to me in such a way.  I get chills.   &quot;Delirious&quot; is a great frantic dance cut and a welcome break to  the almost all-encompassing top singles.  The disco rock single  &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot; is an awesome funked-out party track with an  unbeatable chorus chant of &quot;Ohhh, alright, Dance, music, sex,  romance&quot;.  All the other songs on the second half are really good and  full of sexual innuendo.  In &quot;Lady Cab Driver&quot; Prince talks a  young chauffeur into romance into a one night ride, while R&amp;B drenched  &quot;International Lover&quot; is the height of passion with gifts of  diamonds and pearls (maybe the first time, but not the last) and a  membership to the Mile High Club.  All of the songs have great quirks, but  my favorite is the simple pre-&quot;Emancipation&quot; statement that is  &quot;Free&quot;.  It's one of those powerful tracks that just make you  feel something.  The ending chorus singing of beauties Wendy, Lisa, J.J and  Vanity as well as Prince's emotion that pours out is priceless.   <br />The  full CD is just the best that he can do.  It's a must have for any Prince  fan.  Quirky fun stuff full of the usual greatness that he's always up to.  Just amazing.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This film really has everything: not only a true story which is also moving and full of irony, but a Lynch soaked portrait of the turn of the century, filmed like a gritty old photograph of gritty old factories and  crude hospitals. I'm surprised that The Elephant Man isn't often recognized  as one of the great classic American films.
0767903854|5.0|Who better than Bill Bryson to introduce us to Megascolides australis, the giant 12 foot long Australian earthworms? He is, after all, the antithesis to the academic who, in broaching such a subject, would have you nodding  off within five sentences. Bill is such an amiable entertainer that he can  quickly get you enthused with his brief doses of Australian politics,  history, culture and natural history. Some have thought this book to be  shallow, but they are missing the point. We don't pick up a Bill Bryson  book when we seek research material for our doctoral dissertations.  Likewise we don't pore through a Dave Barry volume to learn the latest  political theory, or a George Carlin tome to soak up modern religious  philosophy.<br />This very funny book provides the reader with an introduction  to many aspects of Australia. He is fascinated with the countryside, and  the amazing flora and fauna that call this intriguing continent home. He  gives us easily digestible historical and cultural anecdotes, and we are as  soon excited about the platypus as he is. No he doesn't spend a lot of time  discussing night life in Sydney; he's much happier looking under a rock in  the desert near Alice Springs or wandering through some secondhand  bookshop, or dusty museum.<br />Plus you thrill as he bravely fights two  giant, poisonous spiders - well.. actually it's their webs that he fights;  the spiders seemed to be away at the moment. Sit there amazed as he tells  you tales of deadly crocodiles, and venomous snakes. Be bored silly each  day when at 5PM he drags you to a lonely pub in order to quaff booze in  quantities sufficient to render him comatose and to generate his next  morning's hangover. The continual recounting of his daily imbibing is the  one annoyance that seems to go through most of his books. That aside, this  is one of his best efforts. Not as good as The Lost Continent (his  funniest) or Notes from a Small Island, but much better than I'm a Stranger  Here Myself.Myself.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Special edition was great. Added scenes were a glad to see bonus.
B00004U45G|3.0|Buy this CD if you are a fan of the best guitarist in the world - Jimmy is  absolutely brilliant - BUT don't expect too much - this is NOT 'the boys'.  Anyone who thinks Chris Robinson approaches The great Robert Antony  (blessed be his name)needs the wax taking out of their ears - As they said  when Bonzo left us 'things will never be the same so...'. Buy this anyway!  - it's a joy to hear Jimmy in full flight even if I find the vocals  grate...but if you weren't at Earls Court or Knebworth then perhaps you  won't notice.
6301543408|2.0|Let's face it, this is among the weakest entries in the series, though for me it is a toss up between this one and #1 as the worst of them all. Still, V is not a complete disaster.  The banter between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is  amusing.  Lawrence Luckinbill cuts a compelling and charismatic figure as  Sybok, Spock's half brother. What ruins the movie is the poorly conceived  story and lousy special effects.   Sybok is motivated by  his vision of  Shakari, but it would have helped if we could get a glimpse of what that  vision was to understand what drove him so passionately.  Plus, it is  rather ridiculous to think that someone will slavishly follow Sybok just  because he helps him get in touch with his pain.  All in all, V has the  feeling of a made for tv movie about it.  It is more than likely that Star  Trek VI was made because they did not want to end the original cast series  on such a bad note.  Of course, die hard Trekkie fans will want to add this  film to their collection anyway, and moderate Trekkies like myself will be  compelled to at least watch it.  But if you are not a big fan of the  series, you can skip Star Trek V.

630242335X|4.0|The Undiscovered Country is better than average Trek fare, following in the wake of the awful Star Trek V.  The storyline is basically sound, projecting the end of the Cold War onto the Federation and the Klingon  Empire.  Even the name of the Klingon chancellor, Gorkon, is a play on  Gorbachev.  <br />Nevertheless, there are some things in this movie that just  don't work for me.  Spock just happens to have a microscpic locator beacon  handy that he slaps on Kirk's jacket just before Kirk beams over to the  Klingon flag ship.  Kirk conveniently manages to keep his jacket with  beacon attached throughout his captivity.  it is also absurd that the  Federation would discuss plans for a secret rescue of Kirk with the Vulcan  ambassador present in the room.  When the Enterprise enters Klingon space  to rescue Kirk, surely the Klingons have the technology to distinguish a  Federation starship from a Klingon supply freighter.  I also do not like  the music that plays in the opening credits, it is too somber in constrast  to the bombastic and epic sounding scores that accompanied the beginning of  the other series entries.  It is also a bummer to have Admiral Cartwright  turn traitor after being a good guy in Star Trek IV.  <br />Still, in spite of  its weaknesses, the original cast do themselves credit and go out in style  in this film.  It is good to see Sulu promoted to command of his own ship.   Christopher Plummer is excellent as the Klingon nemesis Chang spouting  Shakespeare as he torpedoes the Enterprise.  Also, anybody notice the  Christian Slater cameo?  He must have been a Star Trek fan and talked his  way into getting a brief scene, even though his face is half shadowed.   Michael Dorn of TNG cast also has a small part as Kirk and McCoy's Klingon  &quot;public defender&quot;.<br />In spite of its flaws, The Undiscovered  Country merits inclusion into the library of any Star Trek fan.

B00000JCOV|1.0|I cannot believe people call these guys metal anymore.  They said that they lead the revolution against &quot;nu-metal&quot;, but you people sit here and say how great their &quot;nu-metal&quot; sound is.  If you ask me, a band that says that Limp Bizkit, Korn, and MTV all together is trash,  then goes and makes an MTV album with Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and the rest?   Official sell-outs!
0375703764|5.0|If you only purchased this book because you dug the cover and picked it up, found crazy things happening on the pages and couldn't resist it, then you're probably about to write a rave review on Amazon!  &quot;House of  Leaves&quot; take on a life of its own as you read through it like no other  book I've ever touched!  It functions on an intellectual level while  remaining genuinely creepy.  The idea that your world might suddenly begin  to subtly shift for the worse every time you look away is much more  frightening than green mucous crawling out of a swamp to eat a town of  morons!  It works on you as you read, when you find yourself looking up to  make sure that the movement you thought you saw out of the corner of your  eye was really nothing at all.  <br />The sheer number of fake references and  supporting material gives this narrative the illusion of reality.  Come on,  who didn't fake a source on a bibliography in school?  Finally, it's being  put to good use!  <br />I give my highest praise and recommendations for this  inventive novel and its ever larger following.  Don't miss this one!
6301697707|4.0|Giant killer worms?  It's better than it sounds.  It never takes itself too seriously and maintains interest by posing a series of problems that the characters solve intelligently.  I think this film accomplishes exactly  what it sets out to do--entertain with a clever script about people who  react to the unbelievable in a believable way.
0440219078|5.0|This is a very good book. I read it and I didn't think it wouldhave been this good. I recommend this book for young adults andabove. I really enjoyed reading this book and so will you! This is the story of a boy who is chosen to be The Receiver of Memory. There is way too much to summarize in this little review. Anyways, go and buy this book! You will not be disappointed!
B00000JCB3|5.0|this cd is great.  If u like hard rock rap stuff, get this cd.  All songs  r great on this cd.  Even if u arent a limp  bizkit fan, u should get it.  Its worth it
B000002BBY|4.0|It was weird how I found out about this CD. Having read about the latest Gallagher brothers' spat in &quot;Time&quot;, I logged their name in the back of my brain. A week or two ago, I was sifting through the racks in a  local music store, wondering if there was anything interesting I had  recently heard about. Oasis' name popped out in my head, and I bought  Morning Glory, only because I thought it had an interesting title. I had  never heard of the songs, except for Champange Supernova, which gave me a  weird feeling of deja vu. I think &quot;Hello&quot;,  &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Some Might Say&quot;, &quot;Cast No  Shadow&quot; &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (my favorite) and &quot;Champagne  Supernova&quot; are the best songs on this CD. There are a great mix of  songs on this CD. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Some Might Say&quot; are  slower, while &quot;Morning Glory&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; are faster.  &quot;Roll with It&quot;, all though I don't particularly like it, is very  catchy. &quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot; and &quot;Hey Now&quot; aren't  the best songs, but they are certainly listenable, and catchy. There are  also two instrumentals on this CD, on the CD they were untitled, but I  found out from Amazon that they are called &quot;The Swamp Song&quot;,  versions 1 &amp; 2. They are only about 30 seconds, so I don't even bother  listening to them. &quot;She's Electric&quot; is OK, but not very good. The  music is very likable, though. The lyrics are somewhat lacking.<br />But hey,  I thought for a group I had only heard about from an article about two  dysfunctinal brothers, they were pretty good. I'll be checking out the  other Oasis CDs, and hope you do the same.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Hello, Creed?  1992's on the phone . . . . something about wanting their sound back . . . .<br />Why are some people dissing this album saying &quot;This isn't as good as My Own Prison&quot;?  Uh, people  . . . hate to  break it to you, but Creed was terrible THEN and they're even WORSE now.   It really speaks SAD volumes about today's music scene when a derivative  band like this can sell out arenas.  You got great original songwriters out  there like Mike Patton and Ed Ka-Spell being virtually ignored while hacks  like this are making millions.  SAD!   <br />As proven by &quot;Higher&quot;  (Which I have to wake up to at least THREE times per week) and the newest  song &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;, Creed can do nothing daring (unless  you call re-hashing Seven Mary Three or Pearl Jam in the face of meatheaded  raprock brave) or noteworthy for listeners of serious music.<br />And for  those of you who think this band isn't blatantly stealing PJ's sound; that  they're SO original . . . PLEASE!   Get a history lesson kids.  Certain  Seattle natives made this same music - better than this -  10-15 years ago.   Sure, they lifted heavily from Led Zeppelin and the Who, but at least they  forged their own sound out of it, rather than blatantly xerox their heroes.   You can practically pick the songs from &quot;Ten&quot; And  &quot;Vs.&quot; that they snatch from.  <br />Them record companies are going  to sign an original and catchy artist SOMEDAY, I can FEEL it. . . .
B000023VR6|5.0|Over 12 years Dre has got the best beats in hip hop and with each album he  gets better. On his new album a lot of guests support him. Great songs are  &quot;The Watcher&quot;, &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot;, &quot;XXPlosive&quot;,  &quot;What`s the difference&quot;, &quot;Forgot about Dre&quot;, and  &quot;The next episode&quot;. There should have been more songs with Nate,  Xzibit and Snoop. I`m happily looking forward to the new N.W.A. album. This  album is a strong buy!!!
630242335X|5.0|The last  grand adventure of the original crew of the 1701-A,  Undiscovered Country is an exciting and fitting end to  25 years of exploring  our hopes and dreams for the future.  Produced in 1991, two  years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the same year democracy  triumphed in the former Soviet Union, the fictional collapse of the Klingon  Empire and its intentional parallel to real life events is classic Star  Trek.  <br />The story line, direction, special effects, fabulous music and  truly bravura acting performances (especially Christopher Plummer as a  Klingon Cold Warrior) make for what many consider to be the most exciting  Trek movie ever, even more so than Wrath of Kahn.<br />The farewell sequences  will bring a tear to even the most jaded trekker.  If you grew up with the  series, lived through the long years of re-runs, and enjoyed the movies  then you have to own this movie for posterity.  And it's a damned good  adventure to boot.<br />Farewell Enterprise 1701-A, you will always be in our  hearts and minds.  For out of your tall tales and adventures will spring  forth the seeds of our own real need to  journey where no man has gone  before.
0440219078|5.0|Lowry's The Giver, is quite possibly one of the best pices of literature I have ever read.  It stands out from any other book.  Never before has a book captivated readers with a strange world that is similar, but yet  different from our own.  Some of the things characters go through are mind  blowing.  Jonas, the main character, suffers these things with the rest of  the community, however, Jonas begins to learn about things such as color  and temperature that other members in the community do not know about.  He  goes through so much pain and discomfort and learns about death and killing  and war.  When you read these vividly described scenes, your jaw will be  unhinged and you will know that you are completely obsessed with this book.   It might be 2:00 in the morning but once your into this book you'll be  stuck in Lowery's world.  You won't want out, you won't answer the phone or  talk to family or friends until you finish The Giver.  This book is that  good.
6301543408|5.0|The Final Frontier is probably the most under-rated of the Trek Movies.  Directed by William Shatner this is the most lighthearted of the Trek Movies, with the possible exception of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.   <br />Kirk, McCoy and Spock go camping and roast \\"marsh melons\\" in the most  personal of the Trek Movies.  And after 20 odd-years together it is about  time we got to see that these guys are indeed great friends ready to  literally pick each either up when the other falls (which Shatner  practically screams out when he has his character fall from a cliff in  Yosemite only to be plucked from the ground not a moment too soon by a  jet-booted  Spock.)<br />The story is a throw back to the series when  wrestling with questions of truth and reality in a very big way was always  on the agenda.    The most important message being conveyed is that not  only is man meant to explore the great unknown, it is best done in the  company of your pals--it is they who make the journey worthwhile.  That may  not have been the Star Trek ethos back when it began in 1966, but Shatner  hits it on the head when he tacitly acknowledges that that is what has  sustained our interest all these years.<br />For young Trek fans, this and the  Voyage Home, are probably the most fun.
B00000F14B|4.0|The Music Man was quite a good performance.<br />Highly Recommended. I remted it from NetFlix.com.  It was quite a good performance by Robert Preston.  I also enjoyed the &quot;Right Here in River City&quot; special.
B000002H6C|5.0|Slowing down and maturing quite a bit after the classic 'Master of Puppets' MetallicA release a cold, unrelenting album of angry social commentery, cries from drug addiction, suicide and yet at the same time...a  bit of pure emotion.  The opening track 'Blackened' is fast and heartless,  another song about nuclear war, opened with backwards guitar parts and a  blistering rage of intensity.  Followed by the extremely long (but still  EXCELLENT) title track, which protets the travesty that is the american  court system, and then the heavy 'Eye of the Beholder', which essentially  critiques society as we know it, we have track 4, the album's most  well-known and loved song 'One'.  This melodic opus begins with a beatiful  guitar intro followed by soft/hard-verse/chorus thing and finishes with a  machine gun fire riff, enraged and saddened vocals, and a blazing guitar  solo which is perhaps Kirk's most loved.  This is what you would think the  album's 'ballad' is (in the line of 'Fade to Black' from Ride and 'Welcome  Home' from Master)..but i don't really think this is the case.  The vocals  are still harsh and washed out, james no longer even screams or shouts...he  just seems to tell it like it is, as if the growls were his standard  singing voice and he need not put too much power into them as they come  naturally.  The true ballad of the album, the only song that shows pure  warmth and love is 'To Live is to Die', a loving, monstrous, near 10 minute  tribute to the lost Cliff Burton.  Aside from this however, this highly  progressive album consists of harsh, nonstop guitar riffs (which change  CONSTANTLY, this album is highly intricate), inhumanly mechanical solos and  angry lyrics.  Much slower than the band's earlier days, but not as organic  sounding as the Black Album which would follow, this album is an alltime  classic, and like any metallica, should be in your record collection.  THis  band is rivaled by few, and is one who will stand the test of time as  masters of music.
6305132984|5.0|A modern heartbreaker, the Romeo and Juliet of the 60's,(90's?) West Side Story was quite entertaining.  In celebration of our new DVD player, my family and I were watching some newly rented DVDs (West Side Story  included) I once had to do a report on the life of Leonard Bernstein for  school, and had never previously viewed West Side Story.  After I watched  it though, I thorughly(spelling?)enjoyed it.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Well, well, well, Spielberg has finally broke down and started to release movies on dvd...i was quite suprised to see this film available in the format, PLEASENTLY suprised.  I must say that the Jaws collector's editon  dvd is far superior to any other format available for this film.  The sound  quality is pleasing, but not the greatest, but when you've listened to the  film in mono for seven years, it seems quite refreshing. New sound effects  have been added in, but not to worry, the entire thing was done under  Spielberg's suprivision.  The very begining in which the pulsating theme is  first heard fills the entire sound field...a nice surprise.  And the sound  is directional often passing from right, center, to left.  Bass is toned  down a bit, but it actually sounds better this way.  The bass seems to have  more of a role whenever a victim is takin, and also durring william's  pulsating theme.  Picture quality is fine.  Most notable are the sound fx  for when the shark is finally detonated, and the rapid gun fire which  triggers it to do so.  Bass is greatly emphasized here.  great picture,  great sound, for a film thats 25 years old.  Cool extras too.  The  documentary is much longer than i expected.  The game is fun too.  a MUST  HAVE.
B00003CWL6|1.0|When I saw the oscar nominated American Beauty months ago, I expected a very fine movie with talented actors like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.  Instead what I found was a very bland, often wierd film about a man named  Lester (Spacey) going through a mid-life crisis.  Why in the world did this  film win over the Green Mile!   While this movie is fair for the average  movie fan, Big movie buffs like myself should not expect anything more than  just a fair movie.  For those of you who still want to see this movie,  don't get your hopes up for this best picture winner.  Instead, I recommend  renting what should have been the true best picture nod:  The Green Mile.
B000005YZM|5.0|Bought this LP as a re-issue in the Woolworth's cut-out bins  and have never regretted it! Yeah, DATE records (Columbia subsidary) butchered the original cover art, but what the hell... the contents were stellar! I had loved the spookiness of their hit (finally, after several stalled  tries) &quot;Time Of The Season,&quot; and was curious about their ability  to produce an album full of similar material.<br />These cuts are hardly  similar, but memorable they are! &quot;Friends Of Mine&quot; has always  been a favorite (from when it was the flip side of the &quot;Time&quot;  45,) very crisp, cheerful, melodic pop. &quot;This Will Be Our Year,&quot;  an uncharacteristically optimistic love song, showcases the vocal stylings  of Colin Bluntstone (Who went on to sing on some of the Alan Parsons  Projects.) &quot;The Butcher's Tale&quot; is a suitably creepy anti-war  number, appropriate to the late 60's frustration with the Vietnam  involvement.<br />Each tune is so well-crafted and produced that this CD  sounds as fresh today as when I first slapped the vinyl on my turntable,  back in '69.<br />If you enjoy music that can be compared to some of the  Classics the previous reviewers mention, this one is a keeper. (There is  this interesting story about Al Kooper, formerly of &quot;Blood, Sweat,  &amp; Tears,&quot; bringing this LP back stateside from a visit to London  and pushing it on the guys at Columbia to get them to release it, cuz it  was such a gem... Thanks for your efforts, AL!)
6305524866|1.0|Where to begin with this cack? Any film made for ?middle Americans about Britain/the British is going to be heading for the file marked &quot;For the Hard of Thinking&quot;.<br />Think Friends (in London), think Austin  Powers, think Dudley Moore, in fact don't think. Just leave your brain at  the video counter when you rent this.<br />How this cringing pot-boiler passed  the British Board of Censorship is beyond me.  No tired cliche is left  unturned, no stereotype is not brought from the grave, plotlines don't turn  left or right they chunder onwards to the final scene where even in terms  of nauseating feel-good Hollywood endings for the emotionally-challenged  they go some.  You expect everybody to give each other a PC Telly  Tubby-style Big Hug.<br />Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diatribe against  American thinking, merely the mince that you get when you cater for the  lowest denominator - ie money.
0790733226|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. Despite a slow start, the middle and the end of the film are GREAT. The audio commentary is very interesting, never boring. I expected many more &quot;Extra Features&quot;. The film is  superbe on large screen of projector.

B00000JCOV|3.0|Slipknot is a pretty good band, but does have problems. All their songs start out pretty cool, but end up getting too much and too fast in the end. If you're in a p.o.'ed mood great music to release it all. The best thing I  like about Slipknot is how they use their dj. Most bands with dj's don't  use them that much, but slipknot does a great job with it. One big problem  with Slipknot is the lead singer, Corey. He screams too damn much. He can  sing real good, but chooses not too, it's kind of a waste. If all the songs  were balanced with singing and screaming (like wait and bleed) the cd would  rule. Slipknot is good, but it's not for everyone.
B00003CWL6|1.0|When I saw American Beauty months ago, I thought with talented actors like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, the film would be very good, espeically since it was nominated for best picture alongside Green Mile.  I saw this  film and was very disappointed.  How in the world did this film beat out  The Green Mile! .  While there were some good parts in the film, overall it  just wasn't even oscar material.  The film was average for a just plain  movie, but very rank for a oscar contender. For those of you seeing it,  don't get you hopes up for a oscar winner.  Instead, rent what should have  been the true best picture winner, The Green Mile.

6301008960|5.0|I own this movie on video and I've seen it a million times. It's one of my favorite movies. Patrick Dempsey did a fantastic job in his work. The only thing that I am waiting for is the DVD version. If they release it on DVD I  hope they include extra features that's my favorite thing about DVD and it  better not be in widescreen. I hate that. Well, if you hadn't seen this  movie yet it's a classic. It's worth renting or buying. You will like it!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Last night I found myself in a moviehouse seeing CITIZEN KANE for the very first time. I have 2 admit it:<br />IT IS A DARN GOOD MOVIE<br />The editing/montage in the beginning is 2 my knowledle not surpassed. Orson  Welles comes through as a magnetic presence. Yet, the biggest revelation is  not the high technical standard, but that the film has characters of REAL  flesh and blood. KANE is indeed a REGULAR CITIZEN. Seeing KANE to me was  like meeting myself in the door; a person full of flaws - yes a normal  human being. The other actors are good 2 and it is a real joy 2 see  AAAAAALLL the twists the story contains. I brought with me an 18-year-old  and we saw it as a test... We were both spellbound.<br />It MUST be regarded  as a handbook for young directors, writers, photographers...  THIS IS  T  H E key film for anyone who wants 2 be a part of the medium.

B000000OPU|5.0|So, as an album, is moving, vibrant and powerful, much like Peter himself. This album combines the  more recent rock influence of Peter's music with his traditional melancholy. Keep in mind that Peter Gabriel was Genesis  before it was gutted out by Phil Collins (a good but unrepentent   commercial musician). If you must listen to one of Peter's albums, then try  So. Should you like his intensity and his very special way of grabbing your  soul, then try Solsbury Hill and then perhaps the early Genesis - pure  Peter Gabriel. A great artist.  A great man.<br />-Philippe
B00000J7JO|5.0|After their disappointing 1995 release, One Hot Minute, the Peppers are back, minus guitarist Dave Navarro, and with one newly re-discovered friend (John Fruschante) in tow. Fruschante is instrumental in the creation of the  Pepper's ubiquitous sound on Californication. He infuses the music with  blusey and funk-da-fied guitar riffs that can be simletaneously languid and  radiating energy. He is the perfect accompaniment to Anthony Keids's  vocals.  With four successful radio singles stemming from this album, and  perhaps more to follow, Californication can comercially be considered the  Pepper's greatest success so far. But success among the masses aside, this  album is a triumph because it is the product of battles won: Flea's and  Anthony's triumphs over heroin addiction, John's miraculous self-save from  death's rocky precipice, and re-kindled friendships and teamwork among all  four band memebers. The beautiful rock ballads on Californication reflect  the growth and development of the Peppers; they have truly reached their  zenith on this compilation.
630542845X|5.0|Personally I thought the movie was great.  I've watched like 4 times in the past few years, and I think it was an underrated film.  I thought Flanery was very good in it and many of the events were really moving!  I  shed more than enough tears in this one.  The story's creative and i think  the music makes it more dramatic.  For a good movie, I'd get this  one--definitely :)
0553573411|3.0|Good writing that keeps you interested and with numerous well-crafted twists of plot.  Ending, however, felt rushed, was far too fantastical for my tastes, and was generally dissatifying.  As compared to the first in the  series this was so-so.
0691023565|5.0|i must say that this is one of the most interesting books i've ever read.  it is a must for teachers of mathematics and the sciences.  polya exposes with an unmatched wit and cunning the art of breaking it down and analyzing  parts of parts in order to arrive at a reliable and justifiable  solution.<br />polya is the quintessential teacher and this teacher finds his  writings both compelling as well as inspiring.  this is NOT the last book  by this great mathematician that i plan to read.<br />a word of advice for  teachers:  read it and REREAD it until you get the point.  the teaching of  mathematics is not a mere monkey-see-monkey-do regurgitation process.   rather, it is the art of conveying to the student the problem-solving  process. once the student has mastered this talent, the sky's the limit.   and speaking of limits, the sky may just be a gross  underexaggeration.<br />LOVE IT!  got to say again, &quot;BUY THE BOOK!&quot;   and this goes doubly for TEACHERS!
B000002NHN|4.0|Judging from the number of reviews this CD has already received, I doubt that I can add any adulation that has not already been received.  <br />In my opinion, the best recording on this CD is the Highwayman.  This is of  course, an old ballad, and I remember it first from one of my childhood  books.  But I think that Mckennett's performance demonstrates the best of  oral tradition, music and a story that is moving.<br />Hopefully, The  Highwayman can move out of the obscurity of childhood poetry and into our  cultural collective.<br />The rest of the CD is good too, of course, and very  nice listening.  You will not be disappointed.
B00004TRD8|4.0|As sequels go, this is one of the best - along similar lines to the same director's 'Aliens', it's bigger, more expensive, and louder than the original. It isn't quite as good, but I'll get to that in a minute. 'T2' was released at the height of Arnold Schwarzenegger's majesty, and viewed  in almost every way it was a triumph, combining state-of-the-art  computer-generated effects, the biggest movie star in the western  hemisphere in the one role he was most suited for, and a director noted for  his command of technology, and a more family-friendly tone (to suit the  caring, sharing mood in the early 1990's). Even at the time, it didn't seem  perfect, though. After a promising start the film slows down disturbingly,  with two plots fighting each other to a standstill - Robert Patrick's  effectively stoic T1000 disappearing from the narrative for the middle  section of the film, to be replaced by a less-interesting, more pyrotechnic  subplot involving the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems, inc. Still, the  film is of such quality that this can be forgiven, as can the cliched  finale, set in what Roger Ebert would describe as an 'abandoned flame  factory'. A few years later there was a 'special edition', with a few  decent extras which clarified the story without slowing the film down, and  now there is a DVD. a glance at the contents reveals good stuff  (essentially: 'making of', lots commentaries that nobody will ever hear,  the special edition elements, trailers) and bad - six hours of footage on  one CD does not bode well for picture quality. It would have been nice if  the accompanying 'T2:3D' iMax presentation could somehow be included, but  you can't have everything.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I have been collecting Disney Movies for my daughters for the past 6 years.. The only one they are missing is Beauty and The Beast.. Which they can't understand why mom can't find it anywhere.. They love this movie and  can't wait till they have their own copy so they can watch it as much as  they wish.. Thank God, they have their own Tv and VCR..haha
B000002LFZ|5.0|If you are a die hard Fleetwood Mac fan like me, than you will greatly appreciate this album. Being one of my favorite bands, I really appreciated this compolation of all their Greatest Hits. Stevie and Lynsey did a great  job of making their music ring into the hearts of their fans, and opening  the wider play of folk/pop that they established. For first time listeners,  Stevie Nicks will put you through a trance that nobody will do like her.  Every song on this album is a hit, and I think the only one it is missing  is Landslide, which was recorded after this album was put out.
B000031XCR|4.0|&quot;All the Way&quot; is a very nice c-d to own.  It has Celine Dion's  greatest hits including &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; &quot;The Power of  Love,&quot; and many many more. I really enjoyed listening to the first  half of her c-d.  I wish they had included &quot;When I Fall in Love,&quot;  from the movie Sleepless in Seattle, or &quot;Tell Him,&quot; her duet with  Barbara Streisand.  But, overall the collection of her greatest hits were  very nicely put together.  However, her new songs aren't as catchy as her  previous ones.
B00003Q438|4.0|Often overlooked in comparison to 'Aliens' and 'Terminator 2', 'The Abyss' took the length and dramatic structure (a long build-up followed by lots of action) of the former, and introduced some of the CGI that would go on to  enliven the latter. The effects are uniformly excellent - mainly because  most of them are not effects at all, with the cast being put through  chlorinated hell for day after day (something that reportedly reduced Ed  Harris to tears, and is documented in an excellent, hour-long 'making of'  feature) - and in this film you get the impression that nothing else  matters much, as the people seem dwarfed by the surroundings. We only  connect with the good guys in a basic sense (one of them throws a mean  punch, two of them used to be married, and that's it), whilst the villains  are almost totally blank, with the except of the mean-looking Michael  Biehn, here playing against type as a villain. Astonishingly for a James  Cameron film, Bill Paxton is nowhere to be seen. Unwisely, the film has  three endings - four if you count the special edition - and the suspense  seems to drain away after the death of Biehn's character. The special  edition footage adds an extended ending with some impressive effects,  although it adds nothing to the drama. Fox seem to understand how to  present this kind of film on DVD - there's the aforementioned documentary,  plus an extensive look at the storyboards, and you can switch the special  edition on and off. The picture and sound quality are as good as I can make  out on my television, and although the film itself isn't as fun as  'Aliens', much the same could be said of almost any other film.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 is a more mainstream, thoughtful sequel to 1984's &quot;The Terminator.&quot; Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era.  Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns  the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship  with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the  leader he becomes in the future during the film.<br />Previously only  available on special edition laserdisc, the DVD ultimate edition adds much  more background and detail to the story. As with Aliens, the 15 or so extra  minutes of footage add mainly depth to the characters, for example, the  Terminator learning to smile, Miles Dyson's family, and the T-1000 taking  pleasure in killing a dog. This is unlike &quot;The Abyss&quot; with the  half an hour which adds a whole new storyline at the end!<br />As with all  Cameron films the sound is amazing, really sharp, clear thumping sound  although the Brad Fiedel soundtrack is a bit wimpy in comparison to a James  Horner or Jerry Goldsmith score. It does work well - the dark synth score  fits with the metallic machinations. Expect the picture quality to be  amazing!<br />What would have made this release perfect is if was presented in  full screen as well as 16:9. As Cameron filmed it in Super 35 you miss some  of the film in widescreen and some of it in full screen (unlike pan and  scan). So, it looks like I'll still be using my full screen laserdisc for  sometime to come! All we need now is for them to go back to the original  Terminator film and remix the sound from Mono into Dolby 5.1!<br />Brilliant!  Buy it!

B000002UAI|4.0|This Album should have been called &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; and not just because of the titled song but because of the other cover songs, almost every rock legends songs are on here, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins,  Buddy Holly, and more. But it was a busy year, touring, Ed Sullivan, a  Movie, British TV shows, the BBC etc., plus they had to write new songs,  which they either still had some R&amp;R favorites to get out of their  system, or they just didnt have any new songs. The covers are great, but  people wanted to hear what orignal stuff they had to offer and this was a  tease.&quot;No Reply&quot; is a great one all by its self, John got the  idea from an oldie called  &quot;Silouettes&quot; from the 50s. This album  could be a clue for things yet to be for them, for instance they're  standing in the exact same positions as on Rubber Soul, (Without the fish  eye view)in side the CD and on the orignal fold open albumwas a picture of  them standing with some of their favorites and heros in the back of them as  on &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;. They had some good songs on here, the one just  mentioned(NR) and &quot;I'm A Loser&quot; was in the same Theme As  &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.&quot;Every Little Thing&quot;  it has John written all over it, but it was a 95% Paul composition,ELT  actually could have been a single and Paul wanted it to be, but it may have  been voted out. Then theres the hit, &quot;Eight Days A Week&quot;,  possibly another Ringo-ism. &quot;What You're Doing&quot; a sugary tune,  but its good Pop. Its still should be in your Beatles Library, weak points  and all, Its the Beatles and its good.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Absolutely huge for a short while in the late-90's, this 'War of the Worlds'-esque sci-fi opus gave the world an exploding Empire State building, Bill Pullman as a fighter-jock president, and a second Jeff  Goldblum action figure (to go with the noticeably less-muscular 'Jurassic  Park' version).  It was a watershed in CGI and model effects technology,  and whilst the same director / producer team went on to scupper their  reputation with 'Godzilla' (an awful, empty film that made a huge amount of  money), the unsequelised 'ID4' still seems much as it did in 1995. It was  and remains utterly, utterly brainless, but huge fun, and now it's out on  DVD. It hasn't dated too badly - whilst the exploding buildings and rushing  crowds seem obviously faked, the surprisingly-sparce dogfighting footage  still looks top-notch, and the alien vessels still seem extremely  impressive. The acting is unimportant, and the fact that, after the initial  attack, not much happens for the middle hour notwithstanding, it's  old-school mass-entertainment of a type not seen since the mid-70's  disaster movie genre.<br />There's a fantastic amount of extra bits on this  DVD, and along with 'The Matrix' this is a model of how to do this kind of  thing - there's an alternative ending, one which makes you glad that they  ditched it, some extra 'special edition' sequences, two 'Making of'  documentaries, an amusing 'Blair Witch' / Orson Welles-esque fake news  documentary on the alien menace, and some interesting commentaries.  Furthermore, as it is split over two discs, the picture and sound quality  is superb.

6300215512|5.0|This is a wonderful movie -- I would say that it is the best among Wilder's many great films (although &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; are stiff competition). Swanson, Holden, and  von Stroheim give perfect performances, and the cameos by real Hollywood  giants are flawless (not until &quot;The Player&quot; did a director get so  many friends to help with his movie). The weakness, and it isn't that bad,  is Nancy Olson as the ingenue love interest -- she just isn't up the role.  I admit that she was better than I expected from her roles in Disney movies  (she was the pretty housemaid in &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, for example), but  the movie loses its edge when she's on screen. It isn't a big role, but it  is an important one, so the movie isn't quite perfect...
B00000ILDE|5.0|Not so much a sequel to 'Alien' as an alternative take on a similar idea, this is the finest action / sci-fi film of the 80's. Coming back to it after all this time it's surprising to note that it is a proper  science-fiction film, and not just an action film with a vague futuristic  backdrop - the technology seems real, the glimses of futuristic society  seem genuine, and it hasn't dated in the slightest. 'Aliens' has all the  James Cameron trademarks - flashy cinematography featuring acres of  monochrome lighting, an epic length, a fetish for technology, and Bill  Paxton. Despite being over two hours long it flies by - after a long  build-up, the film is more or less constant action, and it even takes some  time to say something deep-but-vague about family and motherhood and so  forth. Sigourney Weaver makes a perfect action heroine, being tough but  recognisably human - whereas other films would either make her wimpish and  compromised, or go the other way and make her an invicible, high-kicking  'manga babe', here Ripley is just a normal person in an abnormal situation,  who happens to be a woman. The subtle-but-obvious romance with the brave,  injured Lieutenant Hicks is handled extremely well, too - making the  opening of 'Alien 3' all the more jarring. The characters are all  stereotypes from WW2 films (Bill Paxton's initially-braggardy marine looks  forward to getting home from the wars, and the moment he does so you just  know that he is marked for death), but they work, and the acting is  uniformly solid. The music deserves a mention, too - it uses a couple of  cues from Jerry Goldsmith's 'Alien' music, and James Horner's alternately  ambient, Wagnerian score was so good that he used bits for a decade or more  afterwards.<br />Surprisingly, the 'extra bits' are quite sparce - apart from  the extra footage from the special edition, there are trailers and an  interview with James Cameron, but not much else.
B000002UDG|5.0|Live and Let Die, No More Lonely Nights, Band on the Run, My Love, Jet, Coming Up, and many other singles are recognizable to many McCartney and music fans in general. This is a recommended first purchase for any  McCartney/Bealtes fan. This incorporates 15 plus years of singles into one  cd. This shows how a hitmaker does it right. It shows many sides of  McCartney and can lead those who like to explore other albums, which are  almost all worth it. A real winner! Buy it for yourself or any McCarntey  fan you know. Both you and them will appreciate and love it. Rock on Paul!
B000002KCC|5.0|Personal anguish is what it is. The dark side of life. But for music fans,  it's kind of like when Dylan was painfully letting it out on Blood on the  Tracks. A private moment let public. Raw, personal (gone public), where the  music just comes from the pained guts. Funny how the track on Sleeps with  Angels, about Kurt Cobain's suicide isn't so raw......
6302426499|5.0|To me, this film is, above anything else, an exploration of the possibility of telling history. But this is too general in itself. I mean by this, that 'Andrei Rublev' only names a mode of historical  representation; one that complicates any naive representation of 'the past'  by a filmic discourse of nature. This consists in recurrent images (horses,  long-takes of water, forest detail...) of nature whose presence cannot be  accounted for in terms of the human action.They are simply there, and made  emphatic as such by their physicality (the burning cow, the horse that  falls from a height and breaks is hind legs, the rotting bird on the forest  floor...). The eponymous artist is a synecdoche for  this mode of  experiencing history, and so is only partially present during the film's  events. Also, there is a pervasive reference to the cinema itself by way of  these images. Its probably significant, therefore, that my Russian edition  of the videotape bears the original title which, literally translated, is:'  Reflections on Andrei Rublev'.

B000007OY0|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is by far, one of the greatest movies of all time.  It is ultimate story of how hope truly never dies, and how good things finally happen to good people.<br />Tim Robbins, in his finest acting  job to date, plays the wrongly convicted Andrew Dufresne.  He is sent to  Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover, and there he meets  Red, played by the ever talented (and one of the best voice-over voices of  all time) Morgan Freeman.  The chemistry between the two is so amazing  throughout the entire movie, and you can clearly see it flow.<br />You really  begin to feel for Andy and his quiet demeanor peppered with subtle  emotions.  Just when you think the movie is going a certain way, the plot  takes an incredible turn that leaves you sitting there with your mouth  open.  From this point, just when you think the film is heading towards its  almost certain climax, it twists another way, leaving you sitting there,  not being able to control your giddy smile.<br />The film is wonderfully  written, and the actors were superb.  It has a beautiful flow to it, and  you can't help but enjoy the masterpiece that you are viewing.  You will  definately be pleasantly satisfied.  This film is an excellent addition to  anyone's video collection.

B00003CXAT|2.0|Spielberg has always been a problematic director, and it is difficult to believe that the same guy who made the dreadful &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; came up with &quot;Schindler's List&quot; as his next effort.<br />Jurassic  Park is a novelty and is very much a film of its time.  When it came out,  the seamless digital effects that allowed the live actors to be put in the  same scene with palpably real dinosaurs created quite a stir.  Now, those  effects are totally pedestrian (check out the recent 2 CD set of the BBC's  &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; if you want to get an idea of just how  extensively those techniques are in use today).<br />Without the impact of the  effects, the film is a total failure.  Spielberg manages some interesting  moments in the first half of the film, and there is a certain energy  leading up to the arrival of the band at Jurassic Park.  Once our hearty  band sets off in the remotely-powered Explorers to see the park, the film  goes completely to the dogs, with only the occasionally mildly interesting  set piece (the T-Rexs by the fence; the scaling of the electric fence) to  break the tedium.  Characters come and go; who cares?  The dialog is  totally banal and unmemorable with some excruciatingly bad moments (e.g.  the obligatory &quot;I hate lawyers&quot; line).   What you have when you  strip away the effects is a cynically minimalist story and character set,  not even half developed, only there to prop up the effects show.  Now that  the effects are not that interesting any more, there is very little left to  this film.<br />The sequel is far worse.
6304806442|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot kudos to the cast keep up the greAt work
6305013578|5.0|This is not a review of any DVD version of Metropolis.  I am given to understand that most of them are of rather poor quality and not worth the purchase.  However, I thought I would just mention that I would love to see  the &quot;restored&quot; version of Metropolis, as released in the  mid-1980s with a rock-and-roll soundtrack, on DVD.  That version had a  pretty good image quality with colored hues on various reels to highlight  certain moods (and I don't mean colorized, as in the horrible Ted Turner  method, either).  The 1980s version was also fairly complete, although I've  seen a celluloid version with some extra scenes at the nightclub, which  surprised me.  As for the rock soundtrack, some people don't like it very  much, but it doesn't bother me.  And besides, that's what the volume  control is for.  But the bottom line is that the 1980s restored version is  probably better than any of the versions currently on DVD, and I would  certainly purchase it if it became available (I'm not sure it's even  available anymore on VHS, though).  Anyhow, the movie gets 5 stars from me  for being a silent classic.<br />The DVD gets a N/A rating from me, BUT...I  should say that Madacy, which makes the most current budget DVD, is  notorious for non-restored DVDs with horrible image/sound quality.  You  have been warned.
6300214540|5.0|I am so sick of people that pick on every single little aspect of a movie, complain about EVERYTHING no matter how good the movie was, and think they are some kind of phylisophical movie critic.  Movies are to ENTERTAIN you.   Not make you a better person, enlighten you.  You go to the movies to get  entertained.  And TOP GUN does this.  Comedy, jets, a love story,  friendship, competition, rivalries, misbehaving, etc...  This movie is  legendary.  If you watch it for fun, you will love it.  If you watch it to  see how accurately they depict life-like scenarios and to judge the  compatability of the characters, you are simply missing the ENTIRE POINT OF  WATCHING MOVIES.  Don't be the english teacher movie analyst type.  Just  watch the damn movie.

0790729385|5.0|I saw this for the first time as a young schoolboy and it made a powerful impact on me. The content was extremely shocking at that time and the Catholic Church had their say about this film. It really is a deeply  religious movie with the overlaying theme of good versus evil. Especially  mesmerizing is the scenes with the possessed Regan and Karras and their  conversations. The terror slowly builds through out the film and comes to a  shattering end after the exorcism. Actually the book is much different than  the movie. The exorcism takes place over weeks in the book and we get into  much more character development, especially with the detective Kinderman  and other mysterious murders and ongoing crimes. But the one night exorcism  was dramatic and was needed for the 2 hour movie length. This is one of the  greatest thriller/horror movies made and I'd strongly suggest reading the  book for additional flavor.

However, his music his fun. It has no real message so,  don't try to find one. He has his own sound which can range from Lynyrd  Skynyrd sounding(I am the Bullgod, Only God knows Why), to Limp Bizcut  sounding(Bawitdaba, Devil With Out a Cause, Fist of Rage) and even some Run  DMC(welcome to the Party). If you want music because its fun, get this  album.
6305807086|4.0|I thought I wouldn't like this movie, but instead I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and better yet, one of the few ORIGINAL movies of the past few years.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because of its use of  caged animals. I found this unnverving, disturbing, cruel, and unnecessary.  Otherwise, it was excellent entertainment.
B00002MZ12|4.0|After 1998's spectacular second album, I wondered what Alanis Morissette  could come up with next. She isn't the Madonna-like chameleon to throw a  surprise in one's face, so when news of her 'MTV Unplugged' album being her  third release surfaced, I was thoroughly delighted. I half expected the  album to be a collection of songs from both her platinum albums, but when I  was finally gifted the CD, I discovered that it was so much more than the  usual Unplugged performance.<br />For one, Alanis sounds better here than on  her studio albums (most people wouldn't agree, but thats just what I  think). Secondly, her cover of songs such as 'King of Pain' are  spellbinding, and utterly mesmerising. Third, her performance of her own  songs are done with such soulful sweetness, that its deeply affecting. I  haven't heard 'Ironic' sound this good ever. She also does a melancholy  version of 'You oughta know', first performed this way at the Grammy awards  ceremony a few years ago.<br />There are the occasional slip-ups, though.  Songs like 'You learn' sound a tad off-key, but it still works. The  instrumental arrangements aren't in top form and there are wrong notes  flying all over the place. But through it all, Alanis manages to hold  center stage admirably. There isn't a single knock-your-brains-out track  here, and thats just as well. One couldn't possibly imagine her doing  'Baba' or 'Right Through You' at a setting such as this. What Alanis does  offer, however, is her own rendition of some classic songs. The set is  enriched by the presence of these, and they blend in remarkably well with  Alanis' own compositions.<br />My personal favorite on this CD is 'Uninvited',  which was first featured on the 'City of Angels' Soundtrack. Ever since I  heard her perform it on the Grammys, I was convinced that this was a single  that needed an acoustic re-rendering. And what an astonishingly good job  Alanis does of it! Easily one of the finest rock ballads of the last  decade, 'Uninvited' is one long, dark look at love and its' blemishes, and  its never sounded better than it does here. Its' almost Gothic strains are  incomparable.<br />Of course, with an album such as this, you are left  wishing that a few of your favorites found their way in. I missed 'Not the  Doctor', 'Wake Up' and 'Thank U', but I'm not really complaining. Maverick  Records no doubt expected this CD to be a top seller and perhaps acquire  cult status as other MTV Unplugged albums have (most notably, Eric  Clapton's Unplugged CD), but the truth is that its been a bit of a bomb,  with many die-hard Alanis fans expressing dismay at the choice of songs and  the production values. Those complaints are valid, to a certain degree, as  this isn't the best-produced CD in the world. But as a statement by the  artist, and as a expression of creativity, Alanis' MTV Unplugged is  unmissable. This young woman really comes alive on stage, and  I would even  call this one of the best live recordings of all last year. It also  demonstrated (to me, at least), that when it comes to rockin' it live,  Alanis Morissette is light years ahead of sister contemporaries such as  Tori Amos (remember the embarassing 'To Venus and Back'?), and even Sarah  McLachlan. And thats no small achievement. Very highly  recommended.<br />--------------'Uninvited' is one long, dark look at love and its' blemishes, and  its never sounded better than it does here.

B00004TDRD|1.0|When the uncut version was shown on television a few months ago,they advertised the video would be the same as the uncut version shown on television. I played the first video and it is the same as the original  movie without the uncut scenes. This is truly one of my favorite movies and  when I saw it on television with the never before scenes, I couldnt wait to  get that version on video. If I had known this, I wouldnt have bought the  Anniversary Edition.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When 1996's `Tidal' came out, it was clear that its' young vocalist was no flash in the pan. Despite an overall sense of gloominess and woe-is-me, Apple's debut was regarded as exceptionally stunning, drawing accolades for its' unmissable single `Criminal' and the magical `Sleep to dream'. It was  thus no surprise that people anticipated her follow up album with sky-high  expectations of it. In 1999, Apple unveiled her second album,  the curiously titled `When the pawn hits the conflicts...'. The full title  actually works out to a mini-poem of sorts, and one that makes LSD-ish  sense upon repeated reading. ...Rarely have there been albums where every single song is an  unrivalled gem, but this is one of them (non-believers, you'd have to  actually buy this CD to know what I'm talking about). Now, both  sides of the Atlantic have sung their praises of this album, and I still  can't get enough of it, despite listening to the album in its entirety over  - literally - more than a hundred times.<br />The opener, 'On the Bound' is a  contradictory anthem of deep longing - despite the fierce independent tone  of the title, we find Fiona wailing 'You're all I need' with a passion  quite unseen since Sinead O'Connor's classic howls on 'Mandinka'. The  second track 'To your love' is a grand ode to love, with the songstress  apologising for her seeming indifference - 'Please forgive me for my  distance' she whispers. This particular track is very effective, and  frankly, its almost bewildering how Apple hasn't got the recognition and  album sales that she so obviously deserves. Honestly, don't people know how  to appreciate good music anymore? As if to reaffirm my bewilderment, the  third, and perhaps most gutsy track on the album, simply floors you.  &quot;Limp&quot; which was an official single release from the CD early in  2000 works on all levels - musically, instrumentally, and lyrically.  Gripping stuff.<br />&quot;Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;Love Ridden&quot; are in  thesame vein as many of the songs on 'Tidal', though the production values  and lyrics are far better. Its apparent that Apple has evolved tremendously  as a singer and songwriter, and 'A Mistake', another of the album's  I'm-gonna-be-me-and-no-one-else tracks is highly reflective of this fact.  One thing thats true of 'When the Pawn' is that it keeps reaffirming the  Angry Young Woman image more so than 'Tidal' and the listener can get weary  of this after a point. At places, its Apple's stunning talents as a writer  that retain your interest in the song and not the music (like 'Fast as You  can' - perhaps the most commercial of all the songs on this CD), but in  most others, its a combination of innovative music and sheer lyrical poetry  that keep you hooked. The final songs on the album are 'Get Gone' and 'I  know' - both sung about a lover who could have done better, and these are  among the slower paced, deeper tracks on the set. Not that I'm complaining.  Fiona has proved time and again that shes a true master of the Love Ballad,  and what better time to show off this skill? <br />'When the Pawn' is an album  that you come out of feeling light-headed and enriched - something I  haven't felt since Tori Amos' 'Under the Pink'. On second thought, that  particular album actually left me with a headache, but it broke new ground,  which is something that Fiona has done here. What affected me most about  this set is that it gets you in a way no other collection of songs has done  through the last year. I've listened to Eminem, played my old Rolling  Stones records again, and yes, even bought Spear's 'Oops...I did it again',  but I haven't ever faced an album with such repeat value. I couldn't  possibly recommend this album strongly enough, so all I'll say is : You'd  better buy it to believe it. Its an absolute must-have.
B00000JZC4|5.0|In an age full of bubble-gum pop, violent rap, and all-around stale music,  it is so refreshing to find a band that can still rock.  Listining to  &quot;Title of Record&quot;, I realized that it's been almost six years  since I've been this excited about a rock album.  The ninties were ruled by  Alternative rock, which is not a bad thing, I like Alternative rock as much  as the next gal,  but I wouldn't call Filter &quot;Alternative&quot;.  For  lack of a better word, I would call the music &quot;Modern&quot; rock, NOT  in the sense of &quot;Modern Rock&quot; of the late 80's and early 90's,  but &quot;Modern&quot; because it sounds fresh and new, but at the same  time, it is just good Rock music, which the industry has been SERIOUSLY  lacking in recent years.  Kudos to Richard Patrick for writing lyrics that  mean something and can actually be understood.  His vocal range is AMAZING.
6305897786|2.0|Roman Polanski's latest outing as director of the macabre is both amusing and disturbing, though never impressive. 'The Ninth Gate' was expected to be the director's comeback bid after the brilliant 'Death and the Maiden',  and the top-notch star cast (save for Polanski's incredibly untalented  wife) promised much. But what remains at the end of it is a confused,  directionless film with no soul.<br />Johny Depp, who has been seen in better  films such as 'Ed Wood', plays a heartless book dealer, who specializes in  locating and trading valuable and rare books. The role seems interesting  enough at the start of the film, and Depp's emotionless performance is  intriguing, but after a while it just gets to be plain boring. He is hired  by a mysterious satan-obsessed collector who wants him to trace two books  that are supposedly written by Satan himself . If this isn't unbelievable  enough, it gets even worse when Depp jumps at the idea (he does it for the  money, people) and takes off for exotic foreign shores such as Lisbon and  the French Riviera in search of the elusive works of the Devil. He also  seems to have a Guardian Angel of sorts - a blonde puffy woman who follows  him around everywhere. This role is played by Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's  real life wife, and its difficult to imagine a role more nonsensical. Its  bad enough that Seigner is a depressingly poor actress, but to watch her  drift in and out of the frames with no particular purpose, is quite enough.  She fared far better in 'Bitter Moon' where she was cast aside Hugh Grant  and Kristin Scott Thomas. She held her own in that film, but falters hugely  in this one.<br />Depp's mission is this : armed with one of the books written  by the Devil, he is to trace the other two and compare the contents, to  decide which of the three is the original. This task seems hard to  accomplish, as there are far too many people dying and too many weird  incidents going on for Depp to feel comfortable. He is also followed around  by Seigner and a dark-skinned motorbike-rider who seems to want him dead.  Depp is repeatedly saved by Seigner, who reveals herself as non-human in  one scene where she flies down the staircase rather than walk it (rather  useful, don't you think?). The duo finally discover the secret behind this  whole sorry tale, and the viewer is left wishing that they hadn't. This is  not much of a story to begin with, but as the tale draws to a close, you  begin to wonder if this really is a Polanski production. Everything is  dismal, the lighting is bad, and the performances are third rate. Depp  almost sleepwalks through the entire movie, even during the sex scenes  (pity that they're as short as they are). Seigner, who has grown as an  actress (and I mean this strictly in the physical sense of the term - she  seems to have packed on at least 20 pounds since her last film) is  eminently forgettable in her role as Angel, despite the secrets that are  revealed about her toward the end of the movie (though you probably guessed  it all along). The only time she looks remotely inspired is while shes  riding Depp as they have sex outdoors. Its also the time Depp expresses any  emotion, but its far too late for any of us to begin caring.<br />One wonders  what the message of 'The Ninth Gate' is, and what the purpose behind making  such a film is. The problem with this film is that it starts off looking  terribly good - the opening sequences are very interesting - but half way  down the line, you realize that it lacks any kind of direction. And despite  Depp's dark, brooding role as a man with no conscience, his potrayal of the  character is so ill-acted that its a shame. He could have done better, and  one would say the same of Polanski.<br />Ultimately, the problem with 'The  Ninth Gate ' is that it doesn't know what its about. If you want to know  how a film shouldn't be made, then, by all means, rent this title (but for  heaven's sake, don't buy it!). Personally, I haven't seen a film this  confusing and disappointing, in years. Heres hoping that Polanski's next is  something more upbeat, and something far more sensible.y, I haven't seen a film this  confusing and disappointing, in years.

B00004TDTO|4.0|The acting is supurb, the storyline is brilliant, and the sharks effects are awsome for a movie of it's age! Anyone can enjoy this movie.
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is the best album I have heard this year. It is byfar the siccest album Dre has put out. And if you don't have it yet go buy it. There is not a weak song on there.
B00003CX6P|5.0|This is an excellent film and, dare I say, better than the original, 1960's &quot;Purple Noon.&quot; I appreciate Anthony Minghella's refusal to go against Patricia Highsmith's novel and add a dose of conventional  &quot;morality,&quot; which dictates that a character who does evil must  receive his just desserts. It's great to see films that don't present such  black-and-white moral absolutism...it's a much more challenging experience.  As far as the rest of the film goes: the cinematography is stunning and may  make you call a travel agent. Not that I lived in Italy circa 1960 (or in  1960 at all), but Minghella really seems to get all of the period details  right, which greatly lends to the fantasy that this film exudes. The acting  is top-notch, with great performances by everyone involved, especially  Phillip Seymour Hoffman who makes mucho gravy out of a character with  little screen time, and the absoutely mesmerizing Jude Law as Dickie  Greenleaf. I understand that it's essential to the plot, but Law's presence  is so dazzling that when he leaves the film, it's just a little less  enjoyable to watch. Nevertheless, this is one of the best films of 1999.
0440219078|5.0|This book is awesome and teaches you a lot of life lessons. I read it in summerschool and I could hardly put it down. So I read it before class goes over the book. It talked about futuristic Perfect world. No pains, no worries. Each people received certain role which is life long assiment from  the elders. Main character, Jonas is assigned as a reciever who recieved  all the memories the giver had. As Jonas get more and more memories, he  realized his society isn't perfect at all. Then he ran away to the  Elsewhere. As the story goes on though, I realized a world with no  difference and no choices is not perfect at all.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is an upbeat and fun CD with lots of great guitar and trumpet hooks.   Its Jazzy!  It Rocks!  Its Funky!  Great lyrics with a great  delivery.<br />Get it!
158234082X|4.0|A jolt to the senses...the story of Anthony Bourdon's journey to chefdom is a rollercoaster ride of almost unbelievable stories. The subculture of the kitchen in any big restaurant is revealed. The stories are on this side of unbelievable, peopled with characters you might not want to get to know any better. Along the way the mysteries of how an establishment is run, the hierarchy, the weirdness, and the people who seem to thrive on this chaos are laid bare...do we get to know the whole story? Probably not, thank heavens. The fact that I have stricken mussels from my plate is proof enough. This is a compelling read, a glimpse into a world we intersect with every day. It is a pleasure to read about anyone who is so passionate about their chosen profession, and who makes a compelling argument for the recognition of all those who choose the same. A bit heavy on the testosteone laced language, it sometimes feels like you are being pounded like veal.....
B00004T9UF|2.0|with the exception of stan ( a truly great song), this album is worthless. The CD is overly offensive and lacks beats. Don't even listen to track 12 or you may feel the sudden urge to vomit. The only thing giving this cd 2  stars is stan, without that, this cd would not be worth reviewing.
6305897786|2.0|I'm afraid this recent addition to the apocolyptic genre was to its detriment.  The movie moved at a glacial pace, leading me to watch the clock every 10 minutes.  The script was bad, the scenery was good...if  you're looking for another &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, keep looking.
0440219078|5.0|The community was excited when they heard the plane go by. Jonas was worried about what his Assignment would be. Jonas starts to see-beyond.  At his Ceremony of Twelve he is afraid they've forgotten him. He finds he is  given a very special assignment at the end of the ceremony.  He is  surprised by his new rules and finds them different from anybody else's  rules in the community. He begins his special training.  Jonas finds out  what being &quot;Released&quot; is. He decides he doesn't agreee with the  community.  The Giver helps him make a plan to escape.  He is forced to  leave early and finally makes it to Elsewhere... or does he?<br />I would  recommend this book to anyone. It's fun for people of all ages to read.
0783107986|5.0|A most compelling documentary series whose scope and detail remain unsurpassed.  Although focused primarily on the European theatre of war, this vast series provides much of interest to American audiences.  A bench  mark from which all WWII documentaries have to be judged.  So far none come  close.
0062502182|3.0|Last spring I read &quot;Illusions,&quot; by Richard Bach. When I read the reviews online, one guy mentioned he thought &quot;The Alchemist&quot; was superior to the story of &quot;Illusions.&quot; I finally got around to  &quot;Alchemist&quot; and I must say I was quite disappointed.<br />First off,  yes I realize it's considered a fable, but the writing style is far too  simplistic. I don't know if it's the translation, but it reads like a book  an elementary schooler would read for a report. Annoying points: there are  page after page of adolescent terms like &quot;Master Work&quot; and  &quot;Personal Legend&quot; and &quot;Language of the Universe&quot;,  repetitious redundancies of quotes, just in case you haven't been paying  attention, and very little masking of points. Coelho must not trust the  reader to pick things up because he screams them at you. <br />But, that's  just the writing style. As for the writing, there is a clear spiritual  basis to the story, which is welcome, but the incessant talk of fate was a  complete turn-off. I also felt there was an air of superiority to it.  Santiago would pass people who seemed happy in their lives, and he would  feel sorry for them because they weren't on a trek. In the case of the  crystal shop owner, yes, he was pathetic for not pursuing his dream of  going to Mecca. But to look at another shop owner and judge he has not  pursued his dream, when perhaps his dream was to settle with his family,  was distracting. <br />On to love....um, he meets a woman midway through the  story and falls in love before they speak? Oooookay. And this woman he  supposedly loves, and with whom he could settle with and be rich, he leaves  to discover a treasure. Why is his dream that of a material/monetary  nature? I had a tiny problemo with that one.<br />So, before this becomes a  lecture. I give it 3 stars for some of the dialogue Santiago has with the  alchemist, and for its basic idea: pursue your dream, as it will haunt youif you don't. However, this is hardly a fantastic book....it just speaks to  the masses, where others may require one to think more.
0671045857|4.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is certainly not one of Stephen King's best works, but based on what he has done over the past decade it looks like he is on the comeback trail. I think it's safe to say that this is more of a  young adult novel than traditional King horror-fiction, so that is how I am  basing my review. It is certainly a satisfying chiller to the graduates of  the Goosebumps books, and provides a decent introduction into the world  that Stephen King can create.<br />Most of the traditional King elements are  present, and the ones that are left out are a very welcome deletion. King  still posesses great ability in making the reader feel as if they are  actually part of the setting. Also present is his amazing way of bringing  the characters of his stories to life, and he flaunts that power to the  maximum in this story, giving life to inanimate objects with stunning  clarity. Of course King's traditional flop ending is included, but it  nose-dives more graciously than in his previous works. It is one of King's  most unusual trademarks, and I wonder if he just lacks the ability to end a  story in a way that doesn't make the reader want to skip ahead to the  epiplogue. What is missing in Girl, thankfully, is every trace of King's  recent delves into perversion that seemed a mainstay only a few years ago  (i.e. The Library Policeman, The Regulators, etc.). Overall this is a very  good story that can attract suspense fans as well as horror fans.<br />I am  reviewing the audiobook version of this story, however, and that portion of  it was simply torture. I don't know who liked Anne Heche's voice enough to  give her this reading, but it might has well have been Fran Drescher for  all I could stand. At some points I honestly feared that my ears would  start bleeding. Heche's screams for &quot;help&quot; were so loud and so  frequent that I felt totally embarrassed, thinking that everyone within a  block from me could hear it through my headphones and wonder what the hell  that noise was. It certainly took away from my enjoyment of the story, but  I have the decency enough to base my rating on King's work and not Heche's.  Ugh. Recommended read, but stay away from the audiobook (unless you listen  to it through a pillow).hat the hell  that noise was.

B00004SVID|4.0|This is a piece of art. Mind you, if you haven't bought any Pink Floyd  albums yet, you shouldn't start with this one (but rather with PULSE). This  isn't easy listening. But it could well lead to your ultimate listening  experience... Just listen to the sound quality. This was recorded in 1980,  some 20 years back, Yet the quality is second to none. A must for PF fans.
6303027016|4.0|Thank goodness the directors and producers let Robin Williams do a little improvising in this film.  When Williams gets behind that microphone it is pure gold.  Some of his crazy ramblings have become part of my  vocabulary...much of this movie is highly quotable.<br />The setting is the  Viet Nam War, but the movie is not about the war itself.  There are moments  of culture clashes, government censorship, and pure hilarity.<br />Although  there are some tender and sad scenes in this film, the comic relief takes  the sting out of the meloncholy moments.<br />I gave this item a 3-star  review, not for its content, but because I think this would be better  rented than purchased.
B000002BFZ|3.0|Most definitely not Pj's best effort, but still quite good. This album is  very raw. Even the slower songs have a rawness to them. However when you  compare this to other pearl jam albums it is probably their weakest. Not  that No Code is bad, but it just doesn't compete with their other works. It  doesn't have a song that you will want to play over and over again. I will  still reccommend this album, because it's jammed packed with solid songs.  There aren't any bad songs here, but not any great ones either. It IS a  must have for any pj fan. And a good buy for anyone that likes rock music.  Yet, if you are new to the band, this is the least essential of their  works.
B000002IWQ|4.0|I'm one of those Rush fans who has almost all of their albums, which means I'm not quite rabid about them. I also only have three of their concerts to  my credit.<br />I'm also one of those Rush fans who was nonplussed by Roll the  Bones and Presto. Thus, I am very happy with Counterparts, it is the best  Rush album in years and a worthwhile addition to anyone's Rush  collection--and an excellent starting point for those just getting into  Rush.<br />I cannot judge a single album by any group in isolation, thus I  have to say this is not my favorite Rush album nor does it contain my  favorite Rush songs--so many excellent Rush tracks have come before, to  name a few: Fly by Night, Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, Signals, Hold your  Fire . . . Permanent Waves . . . Power Windows . . . you get the  idea.<br />However, what Counterparts does contain is traditionally poingnant  lyrics and well-written, appealing music. It is very much a solid Rush  album. In short, you must have this album.
0062502182|5.0|Wow.  Where to begin?  I had to read this book as a summer assignment for an English class, and I had very low expectations for it when I started.  The plot sounded too preachy, like something I'd already heard several  million times before (follow your dreams, let your heart guide you, and so  on).  However, once I finished the first few pages, I was entranced.   Santiago's story fascinated me, and stimulated my mind and conscience to  the point that I find myself thinking of the morals illustrated in The  Alchemist on a daily basis.  Character development is not impressive in  this story, as the boy (Santiago) is the entire focus of narration.  The  other various characters throughout the story do not build much of an  identity.  However, the lack of supporting characters detracts only from  the surface value of the book, not the messages it is meant to display.  In  a nutshell, it's a short, well-written story, and leaves quite an  impression on the reader's outlook on life.  What more can one ask?
B00000J6AG|4.0|Moby sure knows how to play a fine melody. A lot of songs on 'Play' sound great and do have immediate appeal. It is very nice to listen to 'Play'.  Highlights are: 'Porcelain', 'Southside', 'Why does my heart ...', 'If things were perfect', 'Everloving', 'Guitar, flute and string'. Well, what  more could you ask ? After all: it is the music what it is all about  ...<br />If you listen closely to 'Play' I have to admit that Moby is not  original in his approach. He is [borrowing] ideas from other artists.  Ok. Who cares ? It sure sounds great.<br />It is very simple: Moby is not a  great musician technically spoken, neither groundbraking in his style(s).  He simply knows how to touch your heart and soul. After a while I am sure I  will find 'Play' a bit cheesy and 'cheapish' and maybe I will stop playing  it then. I suspect that these songs will not make an everlasting impression  to me. Ok. Who cares ? Radiohead's 'Ok Computer' in the end proved to have  a lifecycle also.
0805017305|5.0|Nothing could prepare me for the emotional effect that &quot;Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee&quot; would have on me.  Dee Brown brings us the history of the white settlement of the American West as told by the people who were  there, both white and Indian. This is not the history we learned in school,  and the book will shatter the images of many of our heroes, but the story  is important enough that I think every American should read it.<br />I also  recommend &quot;The Trail of Tears&quot;, by Gloria Jahoda, which is the  history of the removal of the eastern tribes to the west. These two books  are neccessary if you, as an American, want a complete education of  American History.<br />Beyond education, these books present a people who  loved the earth, trusted and respected mankind, and lived honorable lives.  I trust that these stories of the near annihilation of our native people at  the hands of our forefathers will effect you in unexpected ways, and that  you will come away from the experience with new heroes, and a broken heart.
6305428298|5.0|I saw this movie on a whim. For those people, like myself, who haven't yet taken the big steps into 'indie' films, this movie is a good place to start. <br />It's about Little Voice (played by an amazingly talented Jane  Horrocks, where did this girl come from?), a young woman with a voice  that's barely above a whisper. And living with her mother (played by the  enjoyable Brenda Blethyn), I can understand why. But LV has got something  about her. When she wants to express herself she opens up her mouth and  sings. What I was suprised to learn was that Ms.Horrocks does all of her  own singing, which is amazing! <br />Needless to say, it's not long before  people are discovering her, including sleazy agent Micheal Caine and sweet  pidgeon messenger Ewan McGregor. I'm not going to say any more, I want  everyone to see this movie, because it really is a fantastic one! It's too  bad it's not more well known, because the performances are great, the  acting is superb, and the whole feel of the movie is one that makes you  want to get up and dance!
0441172717|5.0|When I first picked up the torn paperback copy of &quot;Dune&quot;, it was out of boredom. As the book progressed, however, I was reading it out of necessity.<br />In a matter of hours, I was completely immersed in the trials  of Paul Atreides and his cohorts. I cannot compare this novel to any others  I have ever read. Im not a fan of science fiction in any way, but this  irresistable masterpeice drew me in to the point I wished it would never  end. As I reached the end of the book, I was filled with a sense of almost  forboding. The fact that the book would some time end was my only  regret.<br />If you are a fan of liturature at all, read this book! I have  been disappointed by the genre in the past, even by the  &quot;Greatest&quot; of science fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings),  but Dune was one of the greatest novels I've ever had the fortune of  reading. If any of the other books in the series (I've just ordered all 6  of them) live up to their predecesor, then I will not be  disappointed.<br />Although many other reviewers said this book held less  meaning in their youth, I still grasped enough of the epic to enjoy it  greatly at my 15 years of age. If you have come this far, you must take the  next step; read the book. You will not regret it.
B00001PE4D|5.0|For all those teens who have wanted to see it, beware. If a female kissing a female repulses you, the fast forward button is probably your friend (although most teenage guys won't find ANYTHING wrong with some lady-lady  action). For all those adults with the raised eyebrows, okay you have  reason. But there's more to this movie than just the sex premise it  suggests.  What's behind all that is a great lesson. Although most people  don't see it at first, at the core this movie is showing us that being evil  and taking advantage of people isn't going to get you anywhere.  The  premise is that a spoiled little rich kid (played by Ryan Phillippee? I  don't think I spelled that right) makes a bet with his beautiful and  downright evil stepsister addicted to coke (played by a convincing Sarah  Michelle Gellar, with red hair no less). If he can't deflower proud virgin  Annette Hargrove (played by Reese Witherspoon in her most suprising and  well acted role), the headmaster's new daughter, she gets his car. If he  can, he gets her, in bed. There's more to this twisted and twisting story,  but that's the story at the core. Of course all the other parts play  important roles in this, but I won't give that away.  Forget the critics  for a moment. There's some pretty good acting for a movie dubbed for 'only  teens'. And the story was very well written. Maybe it shouldn't have toted  itself as a teen 'Dangerous Liasons' and it wouldn't have gotten half the  critisism. Since most teens haven't seen 'Liasons', then this movie should  be a good rent.  So for all those who have wanted to see it, rent it. At  least then you'll get to decide if you like it or not. But I enjoy watching  it, not only because of the good acting, and great plot twists, but because  it teaches a good lesson. Even though it tries to cover it up.
0380730367|5.0|Just outstanding--his best yet and I loved all of his others.  I find it amazing that Lehane can write of blood and guts and yet define such likeable characters--my heart even went out to Bubba, the killing machine,  in this one.  A great plot with the best kind of ending--a surprise.
630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady is one of the best musicals every. Its humorist, and great songs like `Wouldn't it be Lovely?'. Audrey  Hepburn is witty as Eliza Doolittle and Rex Harrison is wonderful as Professor Henry Higgins. The  story is about a flower girl that turns into being the belle of England  with some help from the Professor. It is winner to eight academy awards  including best picture.
B00004SCX6|3.0|My daughter and her friends can not get enough of Britney!  I actually prefer her first album over this one.  This one is a little more &quot;canned&quot;.  Britney is definately giving the girls what they like  to listen to - bubble gum pop.  There is nothing offensive in the lyrics  for parents to worry about.  If your kids loved the last one - they'll love  this one too.
6304539258|5.0|In this movie George Lucas' dreams and imagination is put to film. I thought this movie was great the special effects. Harrison Ford  plays every ones favorite smuggler Han Solo. Carrie Fisher plays a princess that  sometimes forgets her manners (most of the time when specking to Han Solo).  Mark Hamill plays a whinny, but one the bravest characters in the Star Wars  galaxy Luke Skywalker. You will have a great time going to a galaxy far,  far away.
6305537542|5.0|No movie in this world will ever be more chilling and thrilling than HALLOWEEN. It's been over 20 years and this movie is still being talked about. Today's movies arent scary anymore because they add special effects  and the background music isn't scary at all. HALLOWEEN is a type of movie  that will always scare us no matter how old the movie gets and make us  think who has us on there targets! If you want a really scary movie, then  buy HALLOWEEN...because as far as I know, it will scare you to death!  5  stars all the way!
6305537798|4.0|This movie is based in Shakespearean's `The Taming if the Shrew'. But with a major 90's twist. Popular Bianca can't date till her sister (that she calls a `mutant') Kat dates. So one of Bianca's admirers gets Patrick to  woo the shrew. `10 Thinks I Hate About You' will make you laugh. It's  mostly for a teen audience.
B00000K19E|5.0|THis is definately the best DVD to own now, and will likely be looked upon as the first &quot;Great&quot; DVD. A must buy!
630575067X|5.0|The movie was much better then the title. Again most of the acting was not the best, but the plot was great. Little Jake Lloyd played the future  Darth Vader Anakin Skywalker. Natalie Portman  plays Queen Amidala of Naboo  and future mother of the Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. You will see  Obiwan  Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor and his master Qui-Gon Jinn played  by Liam Nelson. Some old characters you see are Jabba, Greedo, Palatine,  and much more. George Lucas takes you once again to a galaxy far, far away.
B00003CWTI|5.0|THERE ARE SEVERAL GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS FILM. THE FIRST BEING, YOU ARE NEVER LET IN ON WHAT IT IS ABOUT UNTIL YOU GO SEE IT. AND AFTER THE FACT THERE ARE THINGS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT UNDERSTAND  ABOUT IT, BUT THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE IT.  YOU NOTICE THINGS ABOUT THE FILM  THAT YOU THINK MAY HAVE LED UP TO THE CONCLUSION, OR YOU THINK ABOUT THE  WAY THE CHARACTERS WERE DEVELOPED, BUT YOU DON'T FORGET ABOUT IT.  YOU MAY  SAY IT WAS THE WORST EVER WHEN YOU WATCH IT ONCE, BUT WHEN YOU START TO  THINK ABOUT THE WAY YOU WERE A PART OF THIS BRILLIANT SCRIPT WHILE YOU WERE  WATCHINGIT, AND THAT YOU SPENT A DAY IN THE LIVES OF THESE AMAZINGLY  COMPLEX CHARACTERS, YOU WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE YOUR MIND.  THE FILM IS  COMPLEX AND IT IS LONG, BUT BETTER THAN THE DOWN SIDES, IT IS INTERESTING,  IT IS THOUGHTFUL, AND IT IS UNIQUE.  THE ACTING IS INCREDIBLE, THE  DIRECTION AND CINEMATOGRAPHY ARE UNBELIEVABLE, AND THE MUSIC IS  BREATHTAKING.  I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST FILM OF 1999, A TOP 5 IN MY  OVERALL FILM LIST.  A BRILLIANT COMBINATION OF ACTING, DIRECTING (PTA IS A  GENIUS), AND WRITING (ALSO PTA).  YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!
B000001FTA|3.0|What can I say?  I bought this album for Dancin' in the Moonlight.  I heard a band do it live at Penn State WB in 1985 and have loved that song ever since.  Awesome tune.
0812551508|4.0|Okay, you're probably thinking that I'm just someone complaining about having to read it in my freshman year's honors English class.  No, I was not forced to read this.  I read it far before it was on the reading list.  Just wanted to clear that up.  Back to the review.  Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein is an intriguing autobiography of a man obsessed with  tampering with the laws of nature by reversing them.  This novel shows how  man deals with failure and loss.  Unfortunatly, Victor Frankenstein dealt  with failure and loss the wrong way and...  Wait, I don't want to give  away the ending. Anyway, Mary Shelley creates a clever plot and adds some  gruesome happenings and romance, combining the three to make one of the  most famous horror stories.  Unfortunatly, for those of you still  hooked to video games and fast-paced action, you may have a difficult time  reading this for it tends to drag out at some points.  But that's how  literature is, you'll just have to deal with it.  Apart from that, I would  definitly recommend this book to just about anyone.
B000002AQQ|5.0|I absolutly loved this C.D. I certainly don't agree with other reviewers that it is a waste of money.  Sure, it doesn't cover EVERY great song of the '50's- '80's.....but it's not a box- set is it?  It would be impossible  to capture ever great song on one movie soundtrack....People have different  tastes and you can't please everyone....Your favorite songs could be others  least favorites...this C.D. includes many of the influencial songs of  American history....I personally feel that it a good collection of great  music.  This soundtrack is affordable and I highly recommand it.
B00003CWL6|2.0|...before you watch the film, this one's for you. As for me, my disappointment lies in expectations. I heard great things about the film and saw excerpts which led me to believe it would have many humorous  moments. I wish advertisers would do more honest up front promoting of  their films. Say something like &quot;well done, well acted, dark film  about suburbia that will leave you feeling depressed&quot; so that if that  is what you are in the mood for you can say, &quot;yep...this one's for  me.&quot;<br />As for me, I wish I had not spent the money.<br />I give the movie  two stars only because it is well done...for that type of film. I just  never care to see these types of films. Life's rough enough. Give me an  average or better comedy or thriller any day.
B0000046JP|5.0|he is the man who makes me play guitar...
B0000026WD|5.0|Dangerous is arguably Michael Jackson's most ambitious effort to date.  There are no weak tracks on this album. The production is superb as on all  the MJ's recordings, but the sound is completely different than on the  previous albums. The rhythms and grooves on this album are really fantastic  and they hold a strong grip on the album from the beginning to the very  end.<br />The overall mood on this album is darker than on its predecessors.  There are a few exceptions, though, such as &quot;Keep The Faith&quot;.  It's a real stand-out track with it's groovy uplifting feel. Otherwise the  song doesn't quite fit in the album's style, but that's not a bad thing in  this case.<br />The other tracks that stand out are the hauntingly beautiful  &quot;Who Is It&quot;, the groovy songs &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;,  &quot;In The Closet&quot; and &quot;Dangerous&quot;, the touching  masterpiece &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; as well as the widely recognized  &quot;Remember The Time&quot;, &quot;Heal The World&quot; and &quot;Will  You Be There&quot;. These are some of the best songs Jackson has ever  written.<br />There are a lot of hit singles on Dangerous, but with its near  80 minute length and ambitiously epic atmosphere it's not the kind of album  I would recommend for just anyone. However, if you're not afraid to throw  yourself in a mysterious world of groovy rhythms and beautiful melodies, by  all means get it now. If you're a MJ fan, you should definitely buy this  album right now.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary of a Madman is without a doubt Rany Rhoads' masterpiece album. It showcases his amazingly influential style of playing by combining elements of classical guitar with heavy metal. If your expecting Diary of a Madman  to sound like Blizzard of Ozz, throw all of you expectations out the window  cause it doesn't. The opening rocker Over the Mountain is one of Ozzy's  greatest songs of all time and features on of the best Randy solos of all  time. The next song is the fan favorite Flying High Again. You Can't Kill  Rock and Roll is somewhat of a mellow song until it kicks in about half way  through it. The album is filled with long songs. Believer has some sort of  a darkness to it. It's heavy but melodic. Little Dolls and S.A.T.O. are  both rockers and feature amazing guitar work by Randy Rhoads. The power  ballad Tonight is another high point of the album. The true masterpiece on  the album without a doubt is the epic title track. This song is absolutely  amazing. It starts off with Randy playing a beautiful classic guitar piece.  Then the song kicks into one of the coolest metal guitar riffs of all time.  The song then slows down when Ozzy statrts to sing. Throughout the song it  just keeps getting heavy then slows. I can't even describe it. This is an  album that everyone must own, especially guitar players. This album is  truly amazing and you won't regret buying it.
B00004U45G|4.0|Hi everybody,  I got this CD a few days ago and have really given it a  good listening to it.  I'll have to say it was really good.  The one thing  I can't figure out is why they did so many Led Zeppelin songs??  The Crows  have such a good catalog that it is a pity we couldn't hear more of it.   One good surprise about this CD is their new guitarist, Jimmy Page, is  excellent.  Keep up the good work.  I was naked when I listened to this.
B000002B7M|5.0|Blizzard of Ozz was Ozzy Osbourne's first album after his split with legendary Godfathers of metal Black Sabbath. This album would either ensure him a place in music history or just make him fade away as a fallen rock  star. Blizzard secured Ozzy's place in the history books. This is without a  doubt his biggest album to date. This album also marks the world debut of  guitarist Randy Rhoads who was in the first incarnation of Quiet Riot.  He  was one of the greatest guitarists to ever live. He gave Ozzy his signature  sound on this masterpiece of an album. <br />The first song I Don't Know is a  straight forward rocker. This song was and still is used to open his shows  with. The next song without a doubt is Ozzy's most well known song, Crazy  Train. The ballad Goodbye to Romance is an amzing song about saying goodbye  to old friens and welcoming the future. Dee is a beautiful classical guitar  piece that Randy dedicated to his mother Dolores. The next song is the  controversial Suicide Soulution. Mr. Crowley written about magician Alister  Crowley features some of Randy's best guitar work. The only bad part about  the album is the one filler song No Bone Movies. It really takes away from  the albums magic. It's not entirely a bad song though it just doesn't fit  well with the album. Revelation (Mother Earth) is a slow song featuring  classical guitar and piano. Near the end of the song there is another  amazing guitar solo performed by Randy Rhoads. The last song is the rocker  Steal Away (the Night). This song is one of Ozzy's finest. It has great  lyrics and amazing music. I suggest that everyone buy this album because  it's a classic.
B00000729S|5.0|Some of the other reviews here seem a little misleading, in my opinion. The suggestion that the Monks were 10 years ahead of the Sex Pistols and the Clash respectively, implies their music was similar to the 70s version  of punk rock. It wasn't. Not even close. Though it did have a rival  INTENSITY, the sound differs greatly. This is definitely 60s music. The  Monks seem to throw together surf, doo wop, garage/frat rock, and novelty  music and at times play it with an abandon not unlike the Velvet  Underground's &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, with dizzying organ runs and feedback  drenched guitar.<br />Despite the minimalist approach - or because of it -  they were a hard rocking, tight band. They must have been fantastic live.  If they weren't very influencial, they were certainly wildly original and  their music is infectious and awe inspiring. Although  &quot;Complication&quot; is often cited as their best tune, my favorite  part of the album is the three song stretch of &quot;Higgle-dy  Piggle-dy&quot;(What the hell does that mean? Who cares? Sounds good!), I  Hate You&quot;, and &quot;Oh How To Do Now&quot;(Which they sing 49  times!). &quot;Blast Off&quot;, &quot;Monk Time&quot;, and &quot;Shut  Up&quot; are great too. The bonus tracks are interesting, but not as good  as the first 12 tracks. <br />If you like a good story, I highly recommend  Eddie Shaw's &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; book. The &quot;stranger than  fiction&quot; account of his life and times with the Monks is very well  written and the stuff of rock-n-roll. I couldn't put it down.
B000002B7U|5.0|This album is truly amazing. I have to admit I wasn't too fond of Bark at the Moon so I was kind of skeptical about buying the Ultimate Sin because like BATM it had Jake E. Lee playing guitar on it. As I became more of an  Ozzy fan I decided to just buy it. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The album opens with the rocking title track. It then kicks into the best  song on the album Secret Loser. There are many rockin songs on this album  such as Never Know Why, Lightning Strikes, Fool Like You, and the hit  single Shot in the Dark. There is also one of Ozzy's mellower songs Killer  of Giants, for some reason it reminds me of Revelation (Mother Earth). This  album is definately one of Ozzy's best but as many reviewers have said I  wouldn't reccommend this to first time listeners. I would however  reccommend Blizzard of Ozz, Tribute, No Rest for the Wicked, No More Tears,  or the The Ozzman Commeth.
B00003CWLF|5.0|Chow Yun-Fat doesn't shave his head and he doesn't dance (well, yeah, he does... but not like Yul Brenner in &quot;The King and I&quot;) and sing... this movie takes the true story of Anna Leonowens to a level of stark  realism. Other than Anna's (Jodie Foster) Victorian dress, it's easy to  forget that this film takes place in the 1860's... it looks almost timeless  as they are in this robust, diverse and ancient culture. Chow Yun-Fat is  absolutely perfect in his role... proof that he doesn't need to weild a gun  or perform martial arts to be taken seriously.<br />There are moments that are  tragic, tender and bittersweet as the Thai kingdom of King Mongkut faces an  evolution of sorts as it becomes clear that they can no longer shut out the  world.<br />In a world where women are servants and accessories and the King  has many wives, Anna challenges the King's ideas of the strength of a  woman's mind and her resolve. While he has many wives, it is evident that  it is Anna that has stolen his heart. Standing up for principals she  believes in is first met with further demands and decrees from the King,  but is soon followed with concession and kindness. To see the British and  Thai cultures intertwine and react to one another is very interesting and  the contrast of how the King and Anna interact versus the snobbish  aristocracy.<br />The Western world sees the King as just a figure-head of a  primitive culture, but Anna yields respect for him as she would to her own  Queen Victoria, yet does not sacrifice her ideals, beliefs or dignity in  the process.<br />The backdrops, scenery, costumes, etc. are all  breath-takingly beautiful and performances by those in lesser roles are  also believable and stunning. A great film - I wish it would have been  recognized more in theaters.
6305594295|3.0|Highlander and Highlander 2. In 1985 Gregory Widen created a wonderful modern fantasy world which we all know and love by heart. Then Davis and Panzer took it upon themselves to create an awful franchise off it.  Highlander 2 was their first mistake before a series that ignores the  events of the original film and another movie that does the same but stays  with the story. Don't ask me about the carton. NE ways. Highlander 2 is  everything the first isn't. It's awful except the idea of Connor in the  future was interesting and Connery's Ramirez was again enjoyable, however  it takes a beautiful story of good versus evil and makes a sci fi future  story out of it. If you can find this for a good price near the price of  the director's cut go for buying this set, otherwise just buy the first  film, director's cut and widescreen.
B00003CWL6|5.0|There are some scenes in this movie that you'll never forget... some will make you smile, some will make you laugh and some will make you cringe.  The characters are so real in this movie... you totally forget that there  is any acting going on. Real people with real hang-ups, you see them warts  and all.<br />Middle-aged angst, teen angst, voyeurism, infidelity, jealousy,  apathy, homophobia, murder, patricide, blackmail, drug use... I'm not sure  if there is a problem in modern society that isn't in this film. It was an  incredibly crafted piece of work, however, to get so many stories within  stories, so many topics and have them all work in a film of less than 2  hours.<br />Every actor from the most insignificant extra all the way to  Spacey and Bening did an outstanding performance. There was no scene that  seemed artificial or staged... everything seemed like reality, as you could  picture it happening. The film is sometimes a comedy, but also a tragedy...  but not just a dark movie w/ a few light moments. Like life, the light and  dark are intertwined into a feast of emotions, sights and sounds.  The film  underscores the fact that life is often stranger than fiction... and while  all of these crazy stories and people intertwine, everyone else's life  always seems more convoluted, bizarre and complicated than our own when  taken out of context.<br />The R rating is not a joke... this is NOT a film  for kids. There is nudity, sexual inuendo, drug use, violence and probably  more that I'm not remembering right now, but that should be enough... this  is a film for grownups - period.

B00004TJTQ|5.0|This movie was so great. Being a teen,I thought this movie was awesome.Frankie Muniz,and the rest of the cast did a great job! I don't think there is really an age barrier to My Dog Skip. It's perfect for the  whole family. It's entertaining and heart warming,and if you've never had a  dog it might just make you want to go out and get one as loyal and obedient  as Skip was! This would make an excellent Saturday night movie rental. This  movie gets kinda intense,so make sure you have some tissues with you!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears`s new cd is definetally the best one i have got.She is a great singer,and she is my favourite.She is so lucky to be famous all around the world and her younger sister is like,her biggest fan(after me of course!).&quot;Oops i did it again&quot; is a great song and it is very  catchy,too.Anyone who doesn`t like her or her songs(especially &quot;Oops i  did it again&quot;)should at least give her a chance,because if they would  just sit down and listen to one(or more)then i think that they would have  to agree that Britney and her songs are great.Britney Spears is very  talented and i wish her all the best for her singing,modeling and acting  career.GO BRITNEY!
0783226004|5.0|SNEAKERS is one of those movies that didn't have a great box office run despite being a fantastic film. It fortunately has found a second life in the video market, maintaining a respectable, though not stellar, presence  on best-seller lists.  Why does it continue to convert audiences a decade  after release?   Because it's everything we expect of a fun summer movie,  but don't usually get.  <br />You know that feeling you have the day before a  summer blockbuster is going to be released?  That one of total anticipation  that tells you this movie is going to be the best thing you've ever seen?    And then you go to the movie and it totally disappoints you because the  characters were made of cardboard.  the action scenes were implausible, and  the romance was just set decoration?<br />SNEAKERS is not that film.  SNEAKERS  entirely satisfies.  In fact, SNEAKERS is, in my estimation, the very best  (fictional) action film of the 1990s.  <br />At the heart of the film is a  very clever, character-based script.  It combines tried and true Grecian  tragedy with thoroughly modern humor, cool gadgets, and genuine intrigue.   The relationships between Redford and McDonnell-like the friendship between  Redford and Kingsley--is mature and complex, bringing true character  development in its wake.<br />All of it is made possible by phenomenal acting.    No one (except maybe James Earl Jones) is playing to type.  Redford is  very much a reluctant hero, less than confident in his abilities, and  having romantic difficulties with the fact that he's middle-aged and alone.   Dan Aykroyd gives one of his very best performances because he's playing a  character whose eccentricities help define him rather than label him.    He's not really playing `funny' so much as `quirky'. David Strathairn  steals every scene he's in with his alternately comic and tragic  performance of a highly capable blind team member.   Sidney Poitier,  meanwhile, is surprisingly adept at playing lighthearted comedy, and Ben  Kingsley makes an unusually menacing enemy-far, far different than his  sainted performances in GANDHI and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  It's a true ensemble  production in which everyone pulls their load with aplomb. <br />Why, then,  didn't this film do better at the box office?<br />The very fact that this  film successfully integrated thriller, comedy, romance and adventure into a  single script may have hurt.  It was somewhat hard to market because it WAS  so richly textured.   Also, the fact that  it was an original script meant  there was no built-in audience chomping at the bit to see it.  1992 was a  year dominated by derivative films (ALADDIN, HOME ALONE 2, BATMAN RETURNS  and LETHAL WEAPON 3 were the top four movies that year, grossing over $300  million each worldwide), and it was hard for an original voice to be heard.    Still, it did make about $70 million worldwide, making it one of the  biggest grossers of that year's original films.<br />Whatever the case of its  box office's  history, you need to make this film a part of your DVD  collection's present.   No, there's not much in the way of DVD extras, but  sound is important to the plot, and you'll want the crisper audio DVD has  to offer.  Hopefully, though, they'll make a Collector's Edition of this  film for its 10 year anniversary, because the dearth of extra materials is  fairly inexcusable.  With this many stellar cast members, there must've  been great stories about the set.
6305627347|5.0|I thought that this movie was exellent. It had a great plot, and I laughed all through it. Altough its very profound, and some parts are nasty, its a hillarious film for everyone to enjoy. I strongly reccomend this movie to  all.
B00004TL21|1.0|The only interesting thing about this CD is the cover.  After that it's  pretty much generic modern-metal-rock. YAWN.
6303114946|5.0|When I had first seen this film, it knocked my socks off because I love playing chess, and a lot of scenes seemed riveting to me because of my knowledge of the game.  I was pleasantly surprised by the glowing reviews  by those who are not as familiar with the game.<br />Which brings me to  address those who find the issue of parenting a gifted child equally as  intriguing.  May I suggest Jodie Foster's &quot;Little Man Tate&quot;?  This movie, released two years earlier, covered much of the same territory,  and, IMHO, was as well done.<br />I recently read that one way the two  productions are tied is that the same talent agent did the search for each  child to play the prodigy, apparently with the same great results.<br />Again,  I would recommend both of these films.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I am a 15 year old fan of the Beatles so of course I did not grow up with  this music like many listeners did.  But I can understand how the  revolutionary music of the Beatles changed the face of rock and roll  forever.  They could rock on such songs as Paperback Writer and All My  Loving yet their ballads such as Norwegian Wood and Yesterday are among the  greatest of all time.  Lennon and McCartney were truly ahead of their time,  as they saw not what rock and roll was but what it could be.  The Red Album  shows how the Beatles rose to stardom with classic song after classic song.   From the catchy tunes of From Me to You and Love Me Do to the deep lyrics  of Yesterday and In My Life, this two cd set is a must for any beatles fan,  young or old.
0782008372|3.0|For people wanting to import this film into the UK, be aware that this US director's cut is actually the European version of the film, or at least indistinguishably close. On the subject of the quality, I was in two minds  whether to buy if after what I read here. Okay so the DVD might not be as  crisp as the format allows, but at no time during watching as I distracted  buy any imperfection in the quality.
0880381736|5.0|After reading the book, Dragons of the Autumn Twilight, I was so truly in awe of the story. I really need to say that after reading my second Dragonlance book, my eyes were opened to another world of imagination and  fantasy. This was a book that I really loved,along with all of the  wonderful characters. My favorites being Raistlin( of course), and Tas and  Flint and Tanis and Goldmoon and .........  I would like to thank all of  the authors of the dragonlance series from the very bottom of my heart, for  bringing me the joy of believing in dragons,and all that these books say. I  love them all, and I truly would recommend every reader to read every  single one of these books,( as I plan to of course!)                                     Thank You!                                    Happy Reading!
B0000025KI|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made. If you want great rock and roll,  this is one to get.
B000002H6C|4.0|Good news: A big-bomb thrash album by Metallica (like Puppets). Bad news:  The remastering is really bad.<br />The only song I don't like much is  &quot;To live is to Die&quot;.
0156465116|5.0|there is so much to be learned from the little prince.  heteaches us how silly and pointless our lives can get at times.  it's agreat book for children, but it is also a great reminder to adults that they shouldn't waste their life.
B00004TJTS|5.0|This is one of the best films i have seen in a long time that is great for children and adults. A MUST SEE!  as film and a MUST purchase as a DVD!  If there is never a better reason to get a DVD this is the film!  As a  film, the movie is very well made, the film based on a true story, is very  refreshing and heartfelt. Really a nice break from many mindless films  today... It has a very great cast-Frankie Munez who is an actor to look out  for, the always pretty Diane Lane,and the very good Kevin Bacon. the  director should get some-kind of award for a very moving story!  As for  the DVD-WOW!  2 great commentary tracks-one with the director, the other  with Franky Munez and the dog trainer.  While most DVD's now have  commentary tracks, more and more are getting to be boring, but not this DVD  Frankie Munez is very informitive, bright and funny, the director really  gives the listner a deeper feel for the film and the book it's based on.   the deeleted scenes are also a real gem not to be missed!  go and buy this  DVD now you will be very thankfull!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's voice is one in a million. It can bring tears to the strongest of eyes. Live CDs usually get on my nerves,but this just too great of a collection worry about things like audience noise. Mirrorball  contains such beauties as &quot;Angel.&quot; This is definately one of the  most emotional songs ever written. &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; is a  tear-jerker if ever there is one. You absolutely can not go wrong with a  treasure like Mirrorball.
B000002P5W|5.0|This album is totally great but, of the three Jimi Hendrix Experience albums musically this is the weakest album.
B000002BPS|5.0|The Offspring are an interesting group.  They have a world of talent,  especially in the vocals department, displayed by the superstar Dexter  Holland.  &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; is really their only album that  shows their full potential, including the later hit  &quot;Americana&quot;.<br />To start, their track &quot;I Choose&quot; is  simply the best song I've ever heard, compared with the likes of Eminem,  Korn, and Blink.  Other than that, the album is packed with excellent  songs, the real highlights are &quot;I Choose&quot;, &quot;Gone Away&quot;,  and &quot;Amazed&quot;.  This album is well worth your time and money, and  if you are interested in the Offspring enough to be reading this, then buy  it.<br />Best Song: 8 Other notable songs: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

6304169558|5.0|Was this a 5 star movie, all in all?  Some think not, but the worthy parts are extremely worthy, and bear watching over and over again -- one of my top criteria for a 5-star flick.<br />The acting is good, and occasionally  excellent.  I have to say that while Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are good,  the most memorable characters in the show are members of Hunt's support  team.  You may be wondering, do people like them actually exist in the  world?  You bet they do!  <br />I spent long enough in graduate school to know  that individuals like those portrayed in Twister do exist -- maybe not  exactly like the ones in the movie, but the American graduate student crowd  includes extremely intelligent, creative, driven, talented, and sometimes  eccentric individuals.  <br />The story line was not totally original, but it  is timely, especially if you happen to live in the tornado belt (I grew up  in Kansas and now live in Indiana -- both prime tornado habitats).  While  the basic storyline may have left something to be desired, the character  development was great (again, especially among the supporting  cast).<br />Finally, the special effects are awesome!  The FX gurus who worked  this film did a super job of recreating tornados.  Just watch this movie  and see for yourselves.<br />I have watched this video several times, and I  know that I will come back to it again and again.<br />5 stars in my book --  for fun, FX, and interesting characters.<br />Alan Holyoak
B000002572|5.0|THIS ALBUM BLEW PEOPLE AWAY WHEN IT ARRIVED IN RECORD STORES IN THE LATE 70S. GREAT SOUND PRODUCTION. LAYERS OF GUITAR. ALONG WITH VAN HALEN'S FIRST ALBUM, THIS HAS TO RANK AS ONE OF ROCKS ALL-TIME GREAT FIRST ALBUMS. BOSTON  HAD/HAS A SOUND ALL THEIR OWN, AND IT IS GREAT!
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica. What justifiable words can be said that haven't already been  mentioned? Well, none. To put it bluntly, if you call yourself a metal head  and don't own a Metallica album, you're a poser. But your purchase of  &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; will clear all that up. I'm still  arguing with myself on which Metallica album is superior to the rest, but  this has earned it's spot in the top three of their greatest (&quot;Master  Of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; are the other two).  Over a decade later, these songs still feel fresh. From  &quot;Blackened&quot; to &quot;Dyers Eve&quot;, these songs rock. Not as  fast and furious as their previous efforts, this album is pure brutality  nonetheless. Despite the flawless musicianship, the production is  absolutely horrible. You can't even hear Jason's bass for crying out loud.  I really hope they remaster this gem of an album or remake it. Despite that  major flaw (and I do mean major, it sounds like these songs were recorded  in my bathroom), the sheer brilliance and extreme talent displayed here are  nothing short of perfection. Take, for example, &quot;One&quot;. One of the  greatest metal songs in history, period. About a soldier's life in the  aftermath of war, it captures that rare feeling rock songs have. The first  time you hear it, you know it's a classic. The guitars throughout the album  are without error. The riffs are heavy, the solos are set at neck-breaking  speed. Another example (and the second best song here) is &quot;Harvester  Of Sorrow&quot;. Again, truly epic. So is the rest of the album. From the  beautiful intros of songs like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;To Live Is To  Die&quot;, to the riffage of &quot;Eye Of The Beholder&quot; and &quot;The  Shortest Straw&quot;, you cannot go wrong. I can go on and on how amazing  this is, but really, you should just buy it because it is an experience  unto itself.
B000002KH3|5.0|EDDIE VAN HALEN SET THE STANDARD FOR HOW ROCK GUITAR HAS BEEN PLAYED FROM THIS ALBUM ON. A NEW SOUND WHEN IT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE. ALONG WITH SOLID BACKING FROM MICHAEL ANTHONY AND ALEX VAN HALEN, AS WELL AS SHOW STOPPING  ANTICS BY &quot;DIAMOND&quot; DAVID LEE ROTH, ONE OF THE BEST LIVE SHOWS  I'VE EVER SEEN WITH THE ORIGINAL LINEUP. THIS ALBUM STILL HOLDS IT'S OWN.
0385484518|4.0|Several readers have said, &quot;I wish the book was longer.&quot;  But anything longer, and the charm would have gone. Perhaps they may have wanted more details about how the dying professor had applied his various  counsels in his life. There's a sense of that in some places (as with his  children) but not in others. However, what really matters if one gets  something out of this book that strikes a chord,and applies it to one's own  life.
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid Rock is the best Pimp in the world and this cd proves it.  From Bawitadaba to Only God Knows Why and more this cd is his best that he ever did.  this cd deserves to be in the music hall of fame.  This cd deserves  more than 5 stars.....more like 100 stars.  I can't wait for the sequil to  Devil Without a Cause in 2001.
B0000027F8|5.0|It is among my 3 fav. albums ever, the other two being \\"Older\\" \\"Whats the Story, Morning Glory?\\" (by Oasis).
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer's Blue album sounds good no matter what kind of mood your in or  where you listen to it.  Everyone's heard the three big hits  &quot;Undone,&quot; &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain't  So,&quot; but all the other songs on here are classics too.  Of course  there's only ten tracks and that's the only downside.  If you don't have  this CD, then you don't have jack squat!
B00000HZFH|2.0|This is the first time I've reviewed something that I didn't really like  but with all the praise this band gets, I feel like I need to, for the sake  of variety if nothing else. I tried and tried to like this record, I really  wanted to like it, but I finally gave up. The first time I put it on, the  first 2 minutes or so of the first song floored me and I thought &quot;OK,  believe the hype. These guys are the real thing.&quot; But after that,  things, to my ear anyway, went from OK to ordinary to dull in a hurry.  Hardly any bands out there have a totally unique and original sound but the  best ones seem to figure out a way to give that illusion. BTS, on this  record at least, just doesn't pull it off. And after the tenth or so  listen, it occurred to me that if &quot;Classic&quot; rock can house  everybody from Captain Beefheart to Boston, &quot;Indie&quot; (by which I  mean the genre) can house everybody from Sentridoh to Built To Spill. So  there it is: for me, Built to Spill is the Boston of the 90s. Great  musicians, great vocals, smart, sometimes rousing rock compositions:  everything you need to make safe, sound, boring pop songs.<br />But again, I  want to emphasize I'm only talking about this record. I'm sure I'll listen  to Perfect From Now On some day and it wouldn't surprise me if it's great.
B000046PVN|4.0|I've been a devotee of many of John Williams's acclaimed soundtrack  scores, especially the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES trilogies tracks. Out of  all of them, however, my all-time favorites are his compositions for  SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE. Just as he did with the scores to JAWS and the INDIANA  JONES movies, John Williams succeeded beyond all expectations in composing  music that perfectly and unmistakably defined the title character.<br />In my  opinion, subsequent `Superman' movies and TV shows have made valiant  efforts, but have yet to produce soundtrack music that displays and defines  the character's heroism like the score from the first film. Is there a not  a single 'Superman' uber-aficionado out there who doesn't silently hum the  movie's Opening Titles theme to himself whenever he reads the latest issue  of Action Comics, or watches the WB cartoon? I can't be the only  one...<br />`Late...
B00003Q4AI|5.0|Black Earth is in my mind one of Arch's best albums, I love the intensity of a bands first cd, and let me tell, Arch sure supplies the power needed right from the begining.  I don't have any favorite tracks because all of  the songs are simply amazing. The drums are physical and thick, the Amott  brothers show off their shredding skills constantly, the vocals are pure  gold and powerful, and the bass adds that extra haviness needed in order to  fully blow you away, when all of these are combined you get a sick, heavy,  melodic CD called Black Earth.  Oh, I recommend this version because the 2  bonus tracks rock also! All of the swedish bands like Arch Enemy, Darkane,  Opeth, In Flames, Soilwork, rock and truely kow how metal is supposed to be  played!
0767903854|5.0|If you have ever been to Australia, or if you have always wanted to go, this book is a must.  With unfailing good nature, Bill Bryson captures the essential wonder, delight, tragedy and awe of the land Down Under.  I  finished this book with the same mixture of delight and regret that I felt  as my Qantas 747 took off from Kingsford Smith airport to return me to the  US.  Bryson captures the paradox of Australia with wit and clarity and with  a distinctive point of view.  A delightful read, perfect for the summer and  for anyone who has been captured by the allure of Oz.
630514415X|5.0|He Got Game is a great movie about Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), a senior at Lincoln High School on Coney Island. This movie depicts the mental struggle Jesus must endure when he must choose both the outcome of  his basketball career and whether or not to forgive his father (Denzel  Washington) for his mother's death. A powerful drama that shouldn't stay  out of any basketball fan's collection.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a really good CD.  I liked Heaven and Hotrods best, then Down, then No Way Out, and then Sex and Violence.  These are all very good metal songs.  I do, however, hate Sour Girl and think that it is one of the worst  songs ever made.  Stone Temple Pilots should focus more on metal and less  on weird stuff like that.  Although I think that the band members are  really eccentric, I liked the songs a lot and think that it is a good buy.
B00003CWTI|5.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; was excellent, but &quot;Magnolia&quot; was the Best Movie of the year.  With its complex story, Incredible acting, and awesome filmwork and direction, Paul Thomas Anderson PROVES that he is the  next Great film director.  Though the point of the movie is a little  unclear at the end (the theme is supposed to be about coincidences, but  that's not really how it seems to end), The movie is breathtaking and  amazing, as it weaves through the lives of very different people in the San  Fernando Valley.  After watching the movie again, I could not believe the  Academy gave Michael Caine the best supporting actor award, for a  perfromance that wasn't that great, overlooking the best performance of Tom  Cruise's carreer.  Julianne Moore was also amazing, with Philip Seymore  Hoffman, Jeremey Blackman, Phillip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, and Melora  Walters doing superb as well.  The other thing I also appreciate, is the  fact that the movie is 3 hours and 8 minutes long, but it doesn't seem to  be that way.  Though many would complain about the length, this is a movie  that is exciting through every single minute, and if a minute is lost,  that's how lost the movie would be at the end.  Though I don't agree with  the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson hates editing his films, this one  doesn't need to be shorter.  &quot;The Green Mile&quot; was long at the  same running time, but &quot;Magnolia&quot; is not.  The themes are really  deep, but that's why the movie is amazing.  They are deep, yet they're not,  because they are so real.  And through the twists of fate, the characters  all end up accomplaishing there goals or something, by the end.   &quot;Magnolia&quot; is one for your collection.
B000002IZ4|4.0|Super-produced and excruciating detail found its way into every track on  this album.  Somewhere between Pearl Jam, Green Day, and Soundgarden, Scott  Weiland and the boys of STP laid down one of grundge's last runaway smash  successes.   <br /> From the opening crunch of bruising rhythm on Meat Plow to  the Vegas showtune that closes the album, STP spit out against the rock  tradition they were living.  Just a bunch of rebels led by junkie Weiland,  STP's manic riffs may have been copied, but they sure wouldn't admit to it.  <br /> Either way, the music is great.  When STP really rocked out, they were  better than any other grundge band.  Finding hooks on Meat Plow and  Vasoline to open the album, STP can get any modern rock listener hooked.   By the time 90s classics, Interstate Love Song and Big Empty come along,  STP has anyone convinced that they are not only legit, but really, really  good.  The final track of the album, &quot;Kitchenware and Candybars&quot;,  closes off the CD very well.  It also ended something.  Polished grundge  CDs started to give way to polished pop-rock CDs with a decidedly lighter  tone.  With the closing Vegas showtune, STP started to close the door on an  era that Soundgarden would slam shut not much later. <br /> This CD is the  last testament to the power grundge could contain.

0792839234|5.0|I agree 100% with the other reviewers that this is one great and awsome movie it is strange scary unusal and suspencefull and at times makes you jump. I feel that this is what puts horror in horror movies and what a  horror movie is supposed to be like. Angus Scrimm fits the part of the TALL  MAN and is down right scary, man I wouldn't want to meet him in a  cementary. I have the first one and have seen all the rest and I can't wait  to for next one to come out plus I'm going to buy the rest and add them to  my collection of horror movies I  recommened you see this movie and watch  with the lights out BOOOOOYYYY!
6303212379|3.0|When I was a kid this movie was all the rave. I saw it with two of my friends and loved it so much that I made my two younger brothers watch it. It's about a tightly-knit group of friends who are trying to find a way to  spend their last weekend together. Because of a greedy company their  neighborhood is about to be turned into a golf course. While exploring the  attic they find an authentic 17th century treasure map, deciding to find  the gold and save the neighborhood they set out to a sumtarrenan cavern  full of booby-traps and skelatons. You've got to see this film, there are a  few jokes not meant for younger kids like the breaking of a certain part on  the famous statue David and one character Mouth mis-translating packing  instructions to a Spanish housekeeper. Very Funny! Rent it!
0880790121|5.0|I was instantly attracted to this beautifully drawn deck.  I had only seen one other deck and really thought it was quite dull, but when i saw the Sacred Rose Tarot deck I immediately became interested in learning the  Tarot.  I have not been disappointed after all these years.  I have seen  other decks but I always come back to this one because it speaks to me.   The pictures and art work are striking in a way that makes it much easier  to interpret their meaning.  A fine work or art.
0671004107|5.0|The owner of my local sci-fi bookstore recently complained that science fiction has a bad name.  If you write sci-fi in America, you're probably going to be stuck writing sci-fi for the rest of your life.  It's why we  see so few mainstream authors cross over into science fiction, and it's a  shame.  The problem, of course, is that too much sci-fi is written strictly  to be fun reading.  There's nothing wrong with this, but critics want more  flesh in their reading.  Some science fiction has that flesh, and it is  upon such works that we science fiction fans must pin our hopes for any  future acceptance of the genre as 'respectable' literature.<br />Carl Sagan's  Contact is without a doubt one of the best examples of this sort of work.  The story is set in the near future, a 1999 envisioned from the  mid-eighties.  Its protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, is a brilliant young  astronomer who has dedicated her career to the search for extraterrestrial  intelligence.  When she finds it, the discovery changes her world in ways  both radical and global, and personal and profound.<br />The story's scope is  grand.  It discusses seriously the effect of the aliens' Message on the  nations of the world, and also on the minds of mankind itself, which must  now face the fact that it is not alone.  Despite a few awkward digressions,  Contact is masterfully written, engaging, and stocked with interesting and  believable characters.  The perhaps over-hashed subjects of &quot;man  voyages to the stars&quot; and &quot;man meets  slimy aliens&quot; are  downplayed in favor of introspective considerations of &quot;man realizes  the size of universe&quot; and &quot;man acknowledges the  Other.&quot;<br />Science fiction, like any genre, can and should produce fun  reading.  It is a joy, however, to find that it can also produce  stimulating, thought-provoking reading.  Fans and foes of sci-fi alike  should read Contact and see the potential of the oft pooh-pooh-ed medium.
0767903854|5.0|Being a proud Aussie myself, it was a welcome relief to read a fairly accurate account of a country and country people whom are so often misrepresented as blokey, occa, beer-swilling yobs (not that we dont have these!). My usual reaction to an American account of Australia/Australians  is that terrible close your eyes and cover your ears cringe, due largely to  patronising portrayals the likes seen in 'The Simpsons' and nearly every  American movie that features an American playing an Aussie. Bryson's  humorous book, however,  was not the least bit embarrassing and as accurate  an account of a country as any short stint around it could be. There were,  of course, a few inaccuracies and more 'people stories' and less  'history/creepy crawlies stories' would have been much appreciated. My one,  and probably only, major problem with the book was the exclusion of Tassie.  Being a Melbournian I've grown up with the Tassie jokes (nearly all of  which, like the stock kiwi jokes, have something to do with sheep or  incest) and know all the stereotypes about Tassmania having shocking  weather, having nothing to do, and being very backward (all of which are  not at all true).  <br />For all those who aren't Aussies and read this book   thinking 'I'd like to go there some day', make sure you don't forget, like  Bryson unfortunately has, one of Australia's most beautiful places. Apart  from this, I strongly recommend this book as both entertaining and  informative. Unlike most of the reviewers, I haven't read any of Bryson's  other books (though not for long!) so I can't comment on whether or not it  is as good as his previous work. I can say, however, that it is a great  read and really, what more could you want!
B00003CWTI|1.0|I haven't seen anyone comment on the main themes of the movie.  Here they are, as many as I can recall: death, parental abandonment, drug and alcohol abuse, infidelity, failure, disease, social awkwardness, loneliness,  humiliation.  The main reason for introducing so many characters is that it  would be impossible to introduce this much human weakness and corruption in  a normal-sized cast.<br />While I did not much care for &quot;Boogie  Nights,&quot; which had similar themes, it was at least easier to swallow  such an unrelentingly negative view of humanity when applied only to people  in the porn industry in the 1970's.<br />I suppose my biggest criticism of the  movie is its superficial one-dimensional characters. Because of their large  number, each character has a relatively short screen time, which is only  enough time to establish their fatal flaws and devastating circumstances,  without any of the richer and more balanced context in which these occur.   In this sense, the movie is no more realistic than those sentimental films  of the past, where everyone is a good decent person at heart, and the good  guy always does well in the end - the shallow mindset is the same, the  simplistic view is simply reversed.  I suppose in this cynical age, the  mirror-image will be applauded just as much as the original was.<br />This is  a very long movie about the human condition which ultimately has no real  insight into the human condition.  Why would anyone enjoy watching a  disjointed series of cardboard cutouts of suffering humanity?  For me, the  net effect was a disturbed queasiness, like a bad rollercoaster ride where  you know the danger isn't real, but its still sickening.<br />The movie  features excellent performances (however, not Tom Cruise), good production,  and powerful direction.  It has an art-house feel.  It is memorable.  These  might have been enough to partly compensate for my objections if the whole  thing had not been so damn boring.  One commonconsequence of  one-dimensional characters, whether positive or negative, is that by  themselves, without a normal character as a reference point, they're rarely  interesting.  The characters here are, in some cases, somewhat unusual or  odd, but not strange or dynamic enough to really my capture interest even  in short doses.<br />For a movie completely focused on people and their  relationships, this is strangely cold and unsympathetic. It seems to enjoy  the misery it presents.<br />See it for yourself and decide.  If you don't  enjoy the first hour, turn it off, it doesn't get any better.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Since I first saw Jaws when I was a little kid, it's been one of my all time favorite films. I never get sick of watching this masterpiece of suspense, it's your classic man against nature story and I love it. So I  preorderd the DVD and waited for the day I could have some friends over to  christen my great new copy.  Nowadays, I think in order for a DVD to be  competitive and worth buying over renting it needs to have lots of great  extra features. The &quot;featurette&quot; about the making of the movie  that's on here is just the same thing that was on the VHS edition, and as  for deleted scenes and outtakes, there's not much to speak of. The trivia  game was a cute touch, but it's just 12 questions (though they are tough,  even for a Jaws nut like me) and all in all I really was hoping for more  cool extra stuff.<br />If you're a big fan of the movie, like me, it's more  than worth the cost to have the quality of picture and sound you get here,  but if you're just looking for cool extras you'll be disappointed. (But  cranking this puppy on my home surround system made it an absolute blast!  The sound quality is terrific.)
B00001OH7T|5.0|I don't quite understand why so many people are bashing the title track.   Sure, it's catchy, but if you stop (for once!) and listen to the lyrics,  they are fantastic and really deep.  Bowie is viewing &quot;savage&quot;  America through European glasses (I wonder if he read &quot;Lolita&quot;).   &quot;Well well well would you carry a razor?  In a case just in case of  depression?&quot;  It's filled with metaphors and little puns pop up  throughout--I found that the lyrics was just as interesting as the  &quot;soul experiment.&quot; All the other songs are great, I can't think  of a bad tune on here.  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is wonderful, too.  It's crazy...it's almost like Bowie is trying to beat the song to death;  quite different than the lissome original--he treats the lyrics like fodder  for a different purpose.  This album is simply a classic.
0440178002|5.0|For sheer narrative power and immersion in another world, few have done it better than Clavell in Shogun. The book grabs you from the first page and never seems to let go. It's an easy read, too, since you barely notice  you're reading. (I read it in three days back in the seventies, hardly  stopping for air, and have needed bifocals with reading lenses ever since.)  A tale of a shipwrecked English ship's pilot in 16th century Japan, this  book sweeps the reader through a murky world of political intrigue and  bloody violence as the English protagonist, Blackthorne, encounters an  alien culture and a world quite unlike any he had known before. Yet, for  all its rich evocation of the medieval Japanese nation, the book has some  unfortunate blunders including an allusion to a samurai using judo (not  invented until the 1880's, while this book takes place in the 16th century)  and another shaking off his sandals to kick at an enemy (quite out of  character for such warriors since they were predominantly weaponed soldiers  who would never choose to kick an enemy if they had access to one of their  traditional instruments of war as this one manifestly does . . . and  besides so-called karate kicking wasn't introduced into Japan, from  Okinawa, until the 1920's). The worst error, however, had Lord Toranaga,  Blackthorne's captor and mentor, playing chess, a western game, when it  would have made more sense for him to be playing the indigenous Japanese  game of go instead. But the Japanese warriors did have jiu-jitsu, the  forerunner of modern judo, and kicking could have been a part of what they  did (however unlikely) and Toronaga could have taught himself chess since  he is portrayed as a quick study with a keen and very deep mind. And  besides, these are minor quibbles. Basically, this is a powerful tale of  intrigue and maneuvering as the players move about on the chessboard of  feudal Japan, never certain who among them is really moving the pieces and  who is just being moved -- at least until the end. The sense and feel of  the culture, if not the details, also ring remarkably true and you do feel  as though you've lived the entire experience when at last you close the  book on the final page. The characters themselves are based on real people;  the events on things that really occurred -- though Clavell granted himself  literary license to manipulate and recast what he found in the histories to  make his tale a more dramatic one. It's not a true story in that sense, but  it's a great one and well worth a pair of glasses.ing moved -- at least until the end.

B00004TDRD|4.0|This was the first scary movie I saw with my dad. I was 11, a beach bunny already, and after I saw the movie, I went home and when dinner was served, I threw up my spinach.  It was the scene where the captain gets eaten.  I'm  35 now, and only four years ago saw it for the second time.  I'm convinced  even now that when I die, it will be by shark attack.  But I love the  movie.  I still love the beach, and I even love sharks.  I never miss shark  week on Discovery and they are the animals I most love to watch at the  Moody Aquarium.  The movie scared me to death, and yet the actors had me  watching between my fingers.  I felt angry when the mother smacked the  sheriff, but can sympathize being a mom myself.  It's a roller coaster  ride, and I love every hill and drop of it.  I still, however, either close  my eyes (tight) or leave the room when Shaw's demise approach.
0380788624|4.0|The impressive part of this book, besides the fully developed characters, is the level of techincal expertise that N. Stephenson has. He shows a firm grasp and understanding of crypto and other technologies and doesn't overly  explain everything to the reader. This could, however, be a detrement for  non-technical readers, but they could still enjoy the book.
0767847431|5.0|This is my favorite of the three Sinbad movies.  The characters and actors seem less dated than in the other two and the story is better.  I still marvel at the work of Harryhausen more so than I do at the computer effects  of today. I saw this first when I was but a small child at the drive -in  and the swordfight scene with the six arm statue has never left my mind.   To see it after all these years on DVD, it is still a fine piece of work.  The creature footage requires the models to be moved a minimum of 24 times  per second of screen time to appear living.  Some of these sequences are 10  minutes long!   These movies, as are all his others, were truly a labor of  love and it shows in the final product.  If you have not seen this movie or  the other works of Harryhausen you are really missing something.  Filled  with imagination, it is a clean, fun filled adventure for the whole family.
0375501851|5.0|This novel is not easy to describe.  Yes, there is a plot.  But like &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; the plot is secondary to the humor, the creative style, the zany minor characters, and the cultural  observations.  <br />Unlike Tom Wolfe, Zadie Smith gives her characters a  fairly sympathetic treatment, even as she exposes their flaws and  absurdities.  That actually makes her slightly more enjoyable, at least to  me.<br />If four-letter words bother you, then stay away from this book.   Smith's lower-echelon Londoners cannot speak two consecutive sentences  without using the f word.<br />Otherwise, when people ask me for book  recommendations this year, &quot;White Teeth&quot; probably will top my  list among novels.
6303014100|5.0|I watched this video for the first time in November or December of '99. We were going over the Civil War in my American History class, and I thought that watching the movie Gettysburg might give me a little insight and help  me get a better grade on the test that was coming up. The whole thing just  blew me away. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I even told my  teacher that it would be all right to show to her five-year-old son because  hey: no guts and hardly any blood. I recommend this to everyone, even if  they have no interest in the subject.
6305265488|5.0|This Is the perfect movie for romance.  Showing how people shouldnt use predjudice when it comes to love.  I think Drew Barrymore did a exelent job at acting, and think she should try more roles in these type of movies.   Pefert part about the movie is....it doesnt repeat every damn thing about  the childs play Cinderella.  It is a adult version that is totally  different and thats why I think it is a good movie.
B00000JSJC|5.0|Best sci-fi since blade runner. Ignore the bad reviews, its a film that needs to be seen in person before passing judgements. With its really original plot and hyper-kinetic style, Strange days begs to be watched,  even though it crashed at the box office. The opening sequence alone is  probably worth the cost of the dvd, so do yourself a favour a give it a  try. You won't regret it.
B00004R9A1|4.0|This movie is wonderful. It is very original, and all of the Characters are Wonderful. It also has a good soundtrack - 'Why Should I Worry?&quot; &quot;Perfect Isn't Easy&quot; &quot;Streets Of Gold&quot;. The Characters  are Magnificent, my Favourites being Georgette -yes, yes, the Snobby,  Champion Poodle , Tito, the Hyper Chihauhua, and Einstien.
6305910103|4.0|Like most Star Trek fans, I believe &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; to be the greatest in the series of Star Trek feature films. The DVD does a wonderful job of enhancing the video and sound, but Paramount...where are  the extra scenes? In the ABC televised version of the film, there are added  scenes that really help the movie move along better and explain certain  elements that are left out without these scenes. I'm tired of Paramount  just adding a theatrical trailer or two and thinking that it is giving its  fans &quot;something extra.&quot; All-in-all, I would happily recommend  this DVD to any Star Trek fan despite the lack of extras. Looking forward  to the release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; to complete my  DVD collection of Star Trek feature films.
158234082X|4.0|I devoured Kitchen Confidential in a week...!  <br />The book displayed a fine mixture of the confessional and the reportorial, like Mr.  Thompson in his long ago prime.  I've seen a lot of text spilled here as to the ill-qualities of Mr. Bourdain's character.  But, let me tell you, he comes across as an intelligent, humble, loyal, honest, straightforward, stand-up guy...  So if his language is a little salty, don't get your knickers in a twist.  Like his blessed morbier cheese, he's a bit strong, but well worth savoring.  <br />I hear tell that the publisher has contracted him to write a few more volumes, including a book where he will travel the world, ingesting various exotic delights and report on the results.  All I can say is, some enterprising television producer could make one fine series out of this (sort of like those Michael Palin shows, but with a bit more bite). PBS, this could be your next star!<br />I have also heard rumor that David &quot;Fight Club&quot; Fincher has optioned the book to make a film.  Yeah, that would be a good fit.  I could see that. Only, don't get anyone too pretty to play Bourdain.  We need a guy who looks like he's got mitts like a lobster.  END
0723244049|5.0|Beatrix Potter acquired her love and knowledge of animals and the countryside during family holidays in Scotland.  She also had animals as her constant companions as a child.  She sketched and observed them for  hours at a time.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter's books have never lost their popularity.  They are sold by the millions and have been translated into over fifteen  languages.  While her first story in 1902, \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" was  published in a small edition by Frederick Warne, within a year it was an  instant best seller.<br /><br />This deluxe volume is a collection of all  twenty-three tales and some previously unpublished works.  The stories are  arranged in the order of publication as several are linked together by  events or familiar characters.<br /><br />Both the watercolors and black and white  illustrations have been included.  Children will adore the rhyming names of  goosey gander and pig-wig.  The animals seem to almost take on human  personalities.  In fact, these magical stories are often connected with  real people places or animals.<br /><br />Little girls who have a doll house will  love \\"The Tale of Two Bad Mice,\\" in which two hungry mice try to eat the  artificial plaster doll food.  Even at my age I found it irresistibly  amusing.  These little animals just have such great personalities.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000002LAC|5.0|I'm sorry that I'm using this way to capture your atention. This is not a review. How is it possible that the great live album &quot;Heartsongs&quot; is not in your catalogue, since it was released in 1994 and not in 2010  (who is the smart guy who wrote that in your album list ?) It is a  wonderful album and it deserves better! Please promote it in your catalogue  (here in Bucharest-Romania it is Parton's No. 1 rated album).Thanks for  your time.

No wonder white boys everywhere across the country have  this album.

6303212263|5.0|This gem of a movie is a sweeping epic which stands up to repeat viewing remarkably well for a film made between 1976-1978.  From beginning to end the attention to detail and editing are superb, with excellent direction by  Richard Donner.  However, the stars of the show are Christopher Reeve and  John Williams, whose score is perfect and which will always remain a  classic.  A DVD release will really showcase this stunning film and I hope  that Warner Bros. have a release in the works.
B00002DE2L|5.0|The answer is:  YOU do, if it's this recording you're thinking of purchasing.  First, the packaging is incredibly enticing (even without the sexy photo of Mutter! )and unusual-- opening, as it does, almost like  origami.  Then there's the sound:  DGG must be congratulated.  It is rare  that one feels, even with a mediocre home sound system or a poor one in the  car, as if the music is being played just for you and right in your  presence.  Then there's Mutter.  On this recording, she is nothing short of  perfection.  I am very happy to own this truly first class rendition of the  Vivaldi warhorse.
0767903854|5.0|I have all of Bill Bryson's books, all a little different from each other, and all excellent.  This most recent offering is no exception.<br />I haven't yet finished &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; (only started it two days  ago .....), but I would like to review the part that I've read to date.   <br />Australia has always fascinated me, and the kind of trip Bryson embarked  upon is one which I would find very exciting.  He describes everything and  every person he encounters in wonderful detail and has the ability to make  even mundane facts amusing and infinitely readable.  His sense of humour is  priceless, whether he's describing the cities and towns he explores, the  numerous creepie-crawlies and fiercesome creatures, featureless roads, pals  from the past, new acquaintances, strange placenames (yep, stranger still  than from my native UK, which has a few corkers of its own!), and isn't  afraid to aim his humour at his own misgivings either!  Some may call him  cynical, but it's all in very good spirit and no-one need think otherwise.   I think he has a genuine affection for Australia and its people. <br />Bryson  has clearly done his homework and has the knack of giving us an interesting  history lesson along the way.  Of course, it's a Bryson history lesson,  interspersed with that famous humour!  Who's complaining! <br />His style of  writing is such that putting the book down is tough - I'm looking forward  to getting my nose stuck back into it later on today - and I'm sure any  seasoned Bryson fan (or anyone sampling his offerings for the first time)  will find &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; a very enjoyable read.  Just  be prepared for a yearning to visit Australia if you haven't already done  so, and expect a good few loud chuckles along the way! <br />A wonderful book,  and I'm already looking forward to news of another.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Following her multiplatinum debut, Britney spear's 2nd album is most anticipated by fans. I'm not a fan of hers but i bought the album cause i heard there were songs by Diane Warren and Shania Twain. Sadly, there's little in here that i can praise, it's just that most of the songs are not  that memorable. Also some of the songs sound recycled from her first  album.<br />But to give credit where credit is due, Britney sounds affecting  on the last track, Dear Diary which she co-wrote and that one was  touching.<br />Hopefully, a more matured Britney in the future will put out  stronger material and hone her voice to greater heights.
B000001E7V|4.0|and definitely good. The first song is taking you very far away, this women voice is sensual and mysterious...
B00003W8NM|4.0|This Movie would normily get 5 Stars from me if i wasn't in a picky mood right now. When i first saw previews for this movie i thought it was going to me another Action flick with lots of fighting and very little plot.  Boy  was i wrong!   Fight Club starts out as a dark comedy and ends as a  thrilling drama, which along the way takes you through a wonderful begining  and a supriseing climax.  <br />The beginging of this movie is so  inventive(right now at 3:37am im at a lack for better words.) Ed Nortin  plays a insomniac who is possesed by all his desinger furniture.  He soon  visits a testicular cancer support group in order to relelive some of his  insomniac pain.  He soon becomes addicted and attends several other support  groups on a weekly basis in order to sleep.  Soon another pretender shows  up at his testicular cancer support group, a woman named Marla.  From here  Fight Club takes you on a journey of throwing off the yolk of the opression  while creating an equal life for all men and women.  <br />Now we get to the  good stuff....the DVD extras.  This by far is the best packeged DVD i have  seen to this day.  With many commentary selections, the trailers and  halarious PSA's from Brad Pitt and Ed Norten.    I own 3 other DVD's,  American Pie, Being John Malkovich, and Pulp Fiction.  This by far is the  best package with more trailers, commentary, outakes, web spots,  commericals and fun things than all my other DVD's combind.  <br />This is one  of my favorite movies of all time, right up there with Rudy and Pulp  Fiction, but why only 4 stars you ask?  Well partly because the DVD is  Hypoctial when looking at it in context with the movie.  The DVD is very  appealing, a strange cover with a funny picture of Brad Pitt holding a bar  of soap with the caption &quot;Tyler says use soap&quot;.  This is a very  Capitalistic venture by a very anti-capitalistic movie. So that takes away  1/2 of a star.  Second of all the middle of the movie tends to hold some  inchereant dribble at times which is only salvaged by wonderful  performances by Brad Pitt and Ed Norten.  So away with a  half a Star  there.  Still overall the movie is wonderful, if you only buy one DVD this  year make it Fight Club since it is a great movie and has tons of extras.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed. Deep, often depressing and probably not your gran's cup of tea. In my mind, Creed is a cross between Aerosmith and Chris DeBurgh. Human Clay is a typical Creed Production in that it combines amazing instrumental work  and heartfelt lyrics. Each song has its own meaning, many of which various  people can relate to. My personal favourite has to be &quot;Arms Wide  Open&quot;. This probably because it focuses on something many/most people  go through. You haven't heard it, I advise that you make a point of doing  so.
B000002L6P|5.0|&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna is a really great album. When I was  attending college in North Carolina back in the 1980s, my girlfriend and I  used to drive around in my white mustang and we always had the cassette for  this one playing. I eventually broke up with my girlfriend, but the  memories will remain forever. Today I have the album on CD, and it sounds  just as great today as it did back then. This one is a winner. Highly  recommended.
6304415346|1.0|I'd like to say I loved this movie, but I can't. It should have been great, but as with most things Star Trek of late, the writers just seem to drop the ball. First Contact should have been a terrific film, but for some  reason the powers that be at Paramount seem to think time travel makes for  good story telling, when it instead simply displays the writer's lack of  ability to tell a story. However, I must give credit where credit is due,  Jonathan Frakes is an excellent director and does a good job in pacing,  scene layout and delivery to make an otherwise forgettable film  watchable.<br /> First Contact deals with the arrival of the Borg, a  supremely denuded race of cyborgs bent on assimilating everything and  everyone in the galaxy, sort of like a large corporation. Unfortunately  from their treatment within the series (Next Generation and Voyager), they  are no longer the threat they once were. Not only is the Federation  technologically capable of withstanding the Borg, incidence within the  series have proven that there are numerous ways to defeat this supposedly  untakable species. However, that is not say that Starfleet has been sitting  on their laurels either. The introduction of the Intrepid, Defiant, and  finally the Sovereign class of starships proves that the Federation can now  stand up to the Borg, as all three ships were engineered specifically to  combat them. The Defiant is unabashedly called a `Borg Killer' while the  Sovereign (the Enterprise E), is a `Super Battleship'.<br /> So, as the  Enterprise is scouting out comets along the Neutral Zone, the Federation  takes it to the Borg when they arrive at earth. But they just don't seem to  have the fire power until the Sovereign-class Enterprise arrives or so one  would think. Picard, through his contact with the Borg knows where their  weak spot is and they concentrate their fire power in one location and blow  the cube to bits. It is at this point that I was given to wonder just why  the heckPicard has never mentioned this before and placed it in the logs  so that the entire fleet had access to this design flaw in Borg ship  design. Just as the cube explodes, a smaller ship launches out of it and  speeds towards Earth with the Enterprise in hot pursuit.<br /> Then, god  help me, the Borg sphere jumps back in time. Goes back in time to shoot  down the Phoenix, Zephrym Cochrane's warp ship that gets noticed by the  Vulcans who established relations with us Earth trash and ushers in a  golden age for all of mankind. But at the same time the Borg also infest  the Enterprise and begin to take it over...undetected...like a  sophisticated starship like the Enterprise doesn't have an alarm system or  sensors that detect unauthorized beaming into one's ship. They try to cover  this by stating that long range sensors are down, well, inside one's ship  is decidedly short range! While Picard and Data battle Borg on the ship,  Riker and LaForge battle a childish Cochrane in a series of cliche future  vs. the past exchange culminating in a pee joke. As the planet side crew of  the Enterprise fawn over Cochrane, he becomes increasingly irritated  because he isn't building the warp ship to usher in a new age, but instead  because he wants money and naked women, well at least he did it for the  right reasons.<br /> In 9 Star Trek movies there have been 2 that dealt  with time travel! For crying out loud, if it was that easy then everyone  and their dog would be doing it. Doesn't anyone out there understand that  time travel is not only over used, but weak story telling? Just because  James Cameron did it well twice is hardly an excuse shoddy writing. Anyway,  Picard is faced with the fact that he may have to blow up his brand new  ship, and it takes stirring speech from Lily to convince him not to. Except  that Picard's response is right on the money and the Borg should be wiped  out of existence. Meanwhile Data is having problems of his own having been  captured by, you guessed it, the Borg Queen. Anyone NOT see this coming?  She's an individual amongst the drones complete with freewill and user  friendly parts. She attempts to seducing Data by offering him real human  flesh so that he would be one step closer to humanity. Anyone getting tired  of Star Trek movies that are only about Captain Picard and Lt. Cmdr  Data?<br /> Face it, the Star Trek franchise is in the toilet. Everything  from movies to novels to the series still on TV, stink. It won't take  chances, it doesn't push the envelope like the old series did, and is  touchy-feeling and above all else, politically correct with its smarmy  holier-than-thou humanist views. It stopped being science fiction a long  time ago, because they no longer ask the question `What if...'. They don't  explore anymore, there aren't anymore strange new worlds, and sadly, all  they're doing now is timidly going where we have all been before. Star Trek  needs to get back to its roots, take some chances, expand our sensibilities  while it expands our consciousness. It hasn't done that for a long time and  I miss it.
0782008372|1.0|Please be forwarned, you may be amazed that a DVD with allthese features costs so little. There is a reason for this, the picture quality is by far the worst I have -ever- seen, and I've seen plenty. The picture is worse  (yes, worse) than VHS or broadcast TV. I have no idea what they did to it,  maybe drag the source in mud and jump on it a bit, but it's really -really-  atrocious. <br />The movie you've probably already seen, and know it's rather  good. If you want to own a cheap digital copy to have around, this would be  it. If you want a good transfer of the movie, please look elsewhere.
B00001MXWX|1.0|Star Trek: Insurrection, boy that sounds neat, doesn't it? That sounds like a continuation of that awesome first season episode, Conspiracy wherein these malevolent little creatures infest and begin to take over the  Federation. But alas that is not the case with the 9th installment of the  Star Trek movie franchise. Instead what we have here is plot by the evil  Son'a to boot the peace-loving Bak'u from their homeworld and take all of  the life-revitalizing radiation that is emitted by a system of rings that  orbit the planet. The Son'a are dying as a race with them resembling a  Jenny Craig skin peel. On the other hand this radiation that preserves  youth, also makes people erratic and do things not normally in their  nature. What this means is the crew of the Enterprise get to disobey the  orders of a Star Fleet admiral without actually being at fault.<br /> This  movie bothered me on a plethora of levels. First and foremost, it's dull!  We all know that change is bad and this is doubly so when it comes to Star  Trek, because they refuse to break from the formula that has worked in the  past. We all know that none of the main characters will die and we all know  that the Enterprise will never function properly, (In nine movies it has  never once worked right), and in this case the Federation flagship, the  Borg-killing ship-of-the-line, gets the snot pounded out of it by the third  rate alien species. Doesn't anyone have a problem with this? And as usual  we are treated to a third Next Generation movie that deals solely with  Captain Picard and Data. Unlike so many Trek fans, I happen to like most of  the other characters and feel that they simply are not getting the screen  time they deserve.<br /> The Son'a, while evil, for some reason want to  peacefully remove the Bak'u from their world by stuffing them all into a  holoship-basically a space faring holodeck of epic proportions and then  moving them to another world. Why these ships exist is quite beyond me.Instead, the could have just bombed the single village from orbit then  moved in and taken over. Either that or, last time I checked, planets are  big, why couldn't the Son'a have lived on the other side of the planet,  away from the Bak'u? The Son'a are aided by an aging Starfleet admiral who  wants to enjoy the Bak'u's fountain of youth, forgetting of course that  people might notice the fact that the next time he shows up at an admiral's  meeting that he is twenty-five instead of sixty-five. This also ignores the  fact we know transporters can make people younger (Season 2, Unnatural  Selection), and we are treated to even more proof that the Star Trek  universe is not internally consistent.<br /> We get to watch Picard fall  in love, but not really, because that would mean changing the character. We  get to see Data do funny things and act weird, and we get to hear Worf  sing, which we really didn't need to. Riker shaves his beard and starts up  his relationship with Deanna again. And, as I said, the Federation flagship  gets hammered by Son'a, when it should have wiped the floor with them. This  film has very few moments, and those that are good happen between the main  cast, most of which are treated as secondary characters so Picard and Data  can hog the spotlight yet again.<br /> Why can't the powers that be at  Paramount simply make a Star Trek movie wherein the Feds send a fleet of  ships to go slaughter the Borg? Why? Because it's politically incorrect to  commit genocide...even if it's against a species that wouldn't think twice  about annihilating any other species. \\"It would lower us to their level.\\"  they might say. Uh-huh, well, that's better than being made into a mindless  Borg drone. And no matter how dangerous the Borg (or any other race is)  they can't be wiped out, because that would mean change and change is bad.  This way they can keep recycling the same tired old story lines to an  audience that apparently are as apathetic as the writers. Why not a slug  fest between the Federation and the Romulans? Certainly the Star Trek  movies of late cannot be considered intelligent science fiction, because  all they do is reconstitute stories we have seen before. Insurrection is  basically `Who Watches the Watchers' from Season 3. Personally, I think the  series ought to be scrapped until they can figure out just what Star Trek  is, because it ain't this!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Best Maiden album since Powerslave.  Everything about this cd is  cool.<br />Starts with a good, fast paced metal song.  As is usual with Adrian  Smith songs, it brings American style to the band.<br />Then come two songs  (&quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot; and the title track) with slow, melodic  guitar lines that drift into crunching verse and chorus lines.  I should  point out that I think &quot;Brave New World&quot; will be the next single  from the album.<br />Blood Brothers is very dramatic and heartfelt.  It's a  great song with a cool bass/keyboard line, and a great chorus (easy to  write lyrics, but whatever).<br />Another fast metal song comes next  (&quot;The Mercenary&quot;).  If you're a Blind Guardian fan, you might  recognize it as sounding like the song &quot;Into the Storm.&quot;  Just a  thought.<br />&quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; starts out souding very eerie and  ominous.  When you get into the song, though, it develops a very pretty  melody.  It also has a very powerfully delivered chorus, thank you Bruce  Dickinson.<br />If I had to pick a low point, I would say it was &quot;Fallen  Angel&quot;.  It's a good song, it just doesn't stand up to the other  amazing work on this album.<br />&quot;Nomad&quot; is a powerful and  enchanting metal song.  The main riff is very cool.  The many diferent  parts are organized and delivered exquisitely.<br />This next song is, I  think, Janick Gers' best composition ever.  &quot;Out of the Silent  Planet&quot; is also another possibility for the next single.  Melodic,  epic, very cool.<br />&quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;:  Dave  Murray's best composition to date, a good dramatic conclusion to the album,  and the best song on the album.  That's all that needs to be said.<br />If you  haven't already, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!

B0000028UK|4.0|Pearl Jam is a hard band to point out a best album and a worst album, it seems to depend on the person listening. So I can't say this is either.I have only listened to four of their albums. Ten was the only one I liked  immediately. It was easy to feel familiar with it. However this is not the  pj of ten. This band is more political, on completely different tempo and  rythm and melody. I hated all but one song on this album at first. The  layers and sounds between the sounds and hidden charms of their albums were  confusing to me at first. They really force a musical ear to become more  skilled with each album of theirs you listen to. Pj really pushes the  boundaries of rock and roll. The first song {go} is the only one I liked at  first, the guitar is enough to make an electric guitar student want to stab  his guitar into his amp and go cry for a few hours. In other words it makes  a big impression. The frustrating and challenging thing for the listener is  to be jerked around between slow songs and fast songs hard songs and light  soundings songs, it really does push and pull, getting abrasive and rough  then steadilyy pop-like or even folkish at times. Eddie vedder really shows  himself through many of these songs. The politics that they seemed to  display are controversial and touchy. 1 song seems extremely anti-gun which  turned me off to the album at first, but in the end my better judgement  decided to just admit that there is no limit to their own honesty and  devotion to what they believe and what they see and feel. The musicianship  of the band will not cease to surprise you with this album. Indifference is  a great meloncholy composition that sounds a little bluesy in the  background, it sounds like it should have been attached to the end of ten  with the keyboards in the background, and that's the only song that reminds  me of there debut album at all. Eddie vedder's vocals continue to mature  throughout the whole album though. He really shows how outstanding a  leadsinger he is and how many styles he has the capability of covering and  how broad and carrying his voice is.  This album is a must for anyone who  is intrigued at all by pj and there songs and talents. Even though in terms  of a whole album I do not like listening to it front to back as much as  ten, I still can't say that it fails to outdue it in some senses. It is  about 46 minutes long and seems longer. It takes awhile to get into the  record for most of the people I know who have listened to it. After ten,  pearl jam records have become musically far more subtle, and in that manner  less is more, and it makes you work to find the genius. If you give the  album a chance though, I doubt you could really be dissappointed.
0783114222|5.0|I wasn't an HBO subscriber when this film came out and only saw one portion at a friend's home during its original run.  That was enough to convince me to buy the series on DVD even before I owned any electronics  that would play DVDs.  Since then, I've purchased a DVD player and I am as  impressed by the content and the quality of this production as I was back  when I saw it the first time.  For those that are younger, it takes a  committment to get through all the episodes, but they will learn much and  reap great rewards.  For those of us that were actually alive during the  Apollo years, who watched as NASA unfolded a dream for us, Tom Hanks and  HBO take us where we only dreamed.  Despite its cost, I can easily  recommend this set and would encourage moving it to the top of your buy  list.  It is a welcome look at a time when this country had the courage and  the imagination to do things that were indeed great.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Staring at the amazon sales rank of ten I'm shocked. This is the first RHCP album I've bought and it really broke the pop monotony of the radio and tv. This album blew me away. I listen to a wide variety of music, and I  have alot of great cds and of them all I think this is the most unique and  charming. And for reasons I cannot explain, the broad song ranges seem to  fit perfectly together like puzzlepieces and make one solid smooth album  that is totally infectious. You can't not like this album. The Lyrics are  modern sounding but still have some cryptic tones. Anthony's voice carries  through in royal inflection through Saviour which has just recently become  one of my favorite songs. It's epic and endearing, in my ears it's up with  Stairway and Voodoo chile slight return, This is a complete and whole  album. There is nothing missing here from funk to punk. Every instrument is  masterful including the voice. The band has such a great vibe together that  you notice it right off hand. This album is unusual and I've never been  more pleasantly surprised buying an album from a band for the first time.  These guys are definetely worthy of whatever praise they get.  The guitar  work is mind-boggling in it's precision and Flea's bass is a history maker  every time out with it's awesome clarity which doesn't always shine through  with other talented bassists like Jason Newstead of Metallica who often  gets drowned out. Anthony is one of the most underated singers today,  probably due to his rap stylings. Chad props the band up with drum loops  that are so technically close to perfect percussion that I wonder how the  band's chemistry would work if he hadn't have arrived on the scene.  This  album goes from making you dance to making you daydream and visualize the  pictures they paint to making you laugh. Like I said, there isn't anything  left out of this cd. It has non-stop musical chemistry and no times where  there seemed to be filler or unecessary repetition thatcould be cut out.  None at all. This is worth it 100 % and one of the few records in my  collection that I would replace IMMEDIATELY if it got damaged. It spells  musical style and makes the phrase of ''Just the right amount of  everything.'' come in handy when talking about it.
6303942830|5.0|Okay, girls.  Let's admit it.  Daniel Day Lewis is beyond sexy in this film and the romantic scenes actually make my heart skip a beat.  A great kiss.  One of the best on screen.  And guys, there's plenty of gruesome  violent scenes to keep you happy.  Every time I watch it, I appreciate its  complexity more and more.  When I was a kid and read the Natty Bumppo  books, it was never like this!
0790729385|5.0|That the makers of this film managed to base the storyline upon religion,  the most ancient and explored theme of civilisation, and produce this  chillingly compulsive masterpiece with such an original feel and atmosphere  is an achievement unto itself. That it also manages to entertain at least  in equal amount to the classic book from which the movie is derived is more  remarkable still. The scares in this movie do not come simply from the  sudden shocks from shadowy figures jumping out from the shadows, blood  stained machete in hand....although there are some of those!<br />The subtle  realism and ,in places, documentary syle feel of the film join with the  subject matter to prey on the fears of the human psyche, which can be so  sensitive and so thoroughly spooked by the evil side of the  supernatural.<br />You may well find yourself at the end of the film feeling  that, good though the film is, it wasn't quite as petrifying as the hype  has often suggested. But, if you have any imagaination in you at all, you  will discover, late at night as you are getting into bed and have turned  out the lights, how quickly your mind turns back to the movie, thinking it  over, replaying scenes and questioning your own supernatural beliefs, and  bringing your deepest fears vividly to life .....<br />You may find yourself  haunted, not necessarily by the film itself, but by the thoughts that it  provokes, for weeks, months or even years.
B00158K0S8|5.0|There is plenty here about the quality of the movie, arguably the best of all WWII movies ever made. What compelled me to write a review is how Fox treated this Library of Congress designated \\"\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" film (and hence its being archived by them also.)<br /><br />I don't know what Fox did to keep this film in such pristine condition but other studios should take note. This movie looks as good as the day it opened at the movie theaters in 1970. There are no scratches, fading, or any other way to distinguish this movie from one shot in 2008, the year of its Blu-Ray release. The Blu-Ray treatment is jaw dropping. During Patton's famous opening speech you can see sweat beads on George C. Scott't neck. WOW<br /><br />On top of the absolutely stunning video quality, Fox released a documentary on Patton (the man) that is worth the price by itself. It gives probably the closest look at Patton ever put on film with home movies, photos and input from family and an aide to General Bradley. Its outstanding. There is also an intro by the writer, Frances Ford Coppolla that is interesting.<br /><br />If you liked Patton before, you will love this release by Fox, it is by far the best treatment of this historically significant film. If there was an academy award for Blu-Ray presentation, Fox would deserve one.
0783233477|5.0|I was forced to go see this film at the cinema with a girlfriend, and reluctantly sat in my seat to endure 3 long hours of a girly, sob inducing drivel. Instead I found myself drawn inexorably in to one of the most  charming, atmospheric and heart warming tales in the history of film  making. The cast, from the legendary Anthony Hopkins down to the briefest  walk on, all played their characters in flawless, convincing style,  contributing fully towards the creation of this modern masterpiece. I  rarely watch a film more than the once unless it is particularly  special....I have now been enthralled by Joe Black on four occasions , and  have not tired of it yet. In fact, maybe I shall watch it again now......
6305657947|5.0|A slick and well thought out movie. One of the best I have ever seen. Watching it reminded me of a well oiled machine, everything working and moving together. Just wish that Leary had a bigger part.
6300268470|5.0|Without question, Rio Bravo is the best John Wayne movie and the best Western. The casting is brilliant. I never really liked Dean Martin, but he has just the right touch in Rio Bravo. <br />This film has excitement, humour,  a fun musical break, crisp dialogue, and a great conclusion. Over the  years, I have probably watched Rio Bravo 25 times and I never get tired of  it.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Why are my eyes in the back of my head?  Because about every other scene I would roll my eyes and nearly gag.  So sappy.  So corny.  So stupid.  The special effects are OK, I guess, but who cares with a story so terribly  written?
6303965415|5.0|A young woman, Anne, is persuaded by her close friend and surrogate mother, Lady Russell, to reject a young sea-man's offer of marriage because he is poor and without prospects. Eight years later, now a prosperous  ship's captain, he comes home and is looking for a wife.<br />This must be the  definitive adaption of Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. I cannot imagine any  future adaption surpassing it. Every actor is the very embodiment  of his  or her character. Jane Austen, I think, would have recognised them all.  Amanda Root is particularly good as Anne with her large expressive eyes.  She is exactly the way I imagined her to be. And Fiona Shaw as Mrs Coft and  Susan fleetwood  as Lady Russell are both excellent.<br />However, I have some  slight doubt about Ciaran Hinds who played Captain Wentworth. He certainly  looked the part, though why they allowed him to appear in his first scene,  when he should have been at his most impressive, wearing a  filthy looking  top-coat and a scruffy cravat I've no idea. But, as a ship's captain,  Wentworth should have been portrayed as a strong man  with  an easy,  confident manner and Ciaran Hinds it seems to me was a little lacking in  that respect. At the dinner table when he was flirting with the Musgrove  sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, and should have been at his most charming,  he seemed to have some slight awkwardness and impediment in his  speech.<br />And the scene at the recital when he storms off in a jealous rage  was a bit over the top. A good man, even in a jealous rage, would never  treat the woman he loves so unfeelingly, particularly after she has shown  she cares by abandoning the other man and chasing after him. It was  childish behaviour and heroic ship's captains are not normally prone to  childish behaviour. But this scene is false to the novel and falsifies both  the character of Wentworth and Anne. In the novel she does not chase after  him; no woman at that time would have dreamt of doing such a thing ina  public place. It would have been unthinkable. He comes to talk to her and  it in only when  Mr Elliot approaches to urge her  to return to her seat  that he allows his jealous feelings to show and, saying goodbye, leaves  abruptly. But not in anger. More in sorrow than anger.<br />The novel of  course is much richer than the dramatisation could ever be in its allotted  time span. In the scene where Wentworth hands Anne into the carriage  alongside Admiral Croft and his wife, we are left to infer Anne's feelings.  In the novel, Jane Austen devotes nearly a whole page to expressing those  feelings.<br />The film has a very moving ending. It made me cry. But then I  cry whilst reading any of  Jane Austen's novels or indeed whilst watching  any good adaption. The very best, the unbeatable dramatisation, of course,  is the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice - though even that is not  without its flaws.
0440539811|5.0|I might just be imagining things, but it seems that many people are either dislikeing this book for the disjointedness, or the fact that it's quite a hippy/yippy book.<br />Forst off the tense changes aren't a slap in the face  of all literature, when you read to a certain point you understand why  there's the tense changes, it's the ideo of a Faustian universe...well RAW  and RS's Faustian universe, ie the tommorow-today-yesteday approach to  time. this also makes sure that those who really want to learn anything  from the book are willing to alter their mind (even without drugs, such as  sleep depravation) to understand a little better, or will just toss it  aside because it's &quot;not good literature.&quot; If you wanted that, the  books you're looking for are usually considered in the classicals.<br />as for  the hippy/yippy influence...well remember both authors are contemps with  Tim Leary. (And are more than likely Malcalypse the Younger, and Omar  Ravenhurst.)<br />other than that, alter your mind and read, and as the plaque  on Hagbard Celine's wall says, &quot;Think for yourself, Schmuck&quot;

B00004T9UF|5.0|with good beats, smart lyrics, and an incredible sense of humour, eminem has made an album that is equal to if not greater then the Slim Shady Lp. personally, i didnt think it could be done. every song has its own special  attribute to it that makes it listenable over and over. also, if the only  eminem song you like is &quot;the real slim shady&quot; then i dont suggest  getting it. because there are no other songs like it on the album. which,  for me is good, cause im fairly sick of that song. the albums most notable  tracks= kill you, stan, the way i am, marshall mathers, im back, kim, and  criminal. definatly worth a listen or 10!
0451169514|4.0|My first reading of this book was way back in high school and of course I loved it.  How could you not feel as though you were the eighth member of the Loser's Club? Plus, this is the sort of book that just beckons from the  shelf; something you always have to go back to and read, read again.  But .  . . don't you think that books like this are something you outgrow just a  little? Don't get me wrong, it still deserves a four star rating, but the  last time I read it, I felt as though it was no longer as believable or as  thrilling as it used to be (and it was never really a scary novel to begin  with).  Put it this way; I no longer feel like that eighth member but  rather an adult looking in on something that isn't really mine  anymore.<br />My recommendation then? Definately read this book if you are a  King fan and first time readers of IT should love it, particularly if you  are in your teens.  But please, please, please remember that there are  better King novels out there.
B0000027RL|5.0|I have been listened to this album for ten years. I know every song, and I  loved every song. Each song had a good sound, and it was great to listen  to. Since Ten, I didn't hear any album as good as Ten. Binaural came close,  but there was one or two songs on that album I didn't like. Here is my  favorite PJ albums in order. 1. Ten 2. Binaural 3. Yield 4. Vitology 5. Vs  6. No Code After all those albums, Ten is with out question the best! My  favorite songs are Once, Even Flow, Alive, Black, Jeremy, and pretty much  song on it. If you haven't got this album yet, then get up and get  it!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UKS|5.0|now this is great music...not like that garbage called music from blinky dinky stinky 182
B0000024W3|4.0|I wasnt alive in 69-70 when this came out, but judging by what was going on in music at that time, it is easily understood how this album was hated so much.  I personally think taken out of the Hendrix/Doors (etc) era it is  a fabulous album and the most varied record of his career!  Blues, country,  standards, rock--they're all here!  With songs like &quot;Blue Moon&quot;  theres no way this album would have been hip in 1969.  But now, as one who  has studied the roots of Jazz and Rock I find this an important collection.  Dylan resurects some classic and even obscure tunes that probably inspired  him to become a pioneer in the folk/rock movement  Shows all sides and  voices of Dylan, half of the album is in his &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;  voice and the rest has varied vocals.  Self Portrait indeed!  This was  Dylan saying &quot;this is what I like and I could care less if it  sells.&quot;  I love this album!  I just cant say enough about it.  Just  makes me feel good when I listen to it, which is what music is supposed to  be all about.  I wont give it 5 stars because it isnt a classic, and I  didnt care for &quot;Little Sadie(s)&quot;, which are basically a rip off  of &quot;Cocaine Blues.&quot;   A little of this and that...love it!Great  mellow evening listening.
6305949972|5.0|I believe this movie is one of the masterpiece of Tim Burton's work.  I love his dark jokes and the all the characters in this movie.

0385472951|3.0|Well, as a fan of John Grisham, it is difficult for me to find the negatives in his work. However, in &quot;The Partner&quot;, I found myself floundering to continue reading. And I do believe Grisham is now groping to  keep up with the high demand for his books.<br />The plot seemed like a  &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; device. Lawyer, Patrick Lanigan steals millions  from his huge law firm. His troubles really begin when they find him in  Brazil, living a quiet life as Danilo Silva.<br />This is quasi so-so read,  but nothing compared to Grisham's first, &quot;A Time To  Kill&quot;.<br />Thanks--CDS
B000031XCR|5.0|This was a great CD, having all of her greatest hits on it. If you're looking for a track-by-track review, here it is:<br />1. The Power of Love This is one of my favorites on the CD. It is a slow, calming song, but it  really gets you moving to the beat!<br />2. If you Asked me to This is another  typical Celine song- slow and calm, very good for listening to at night  when you're trying to sleep. It has a little bit of &quot;twinkling&quot;  piano music, which can be annoying, but otherwise a great song<br />3. Beauty  and the Beast (duet with Peabo Bryson) This is a great song, I'm sure  you've all already heard it<br />4. Because you Loved Me Another great song  (this CD sure is great!) that is a little more upbeat and a better dancing  song than some of her others, but still calming<br />5. It's all Coming Back  to me Now This is one of my favorites. It's slow and very touching<br />6.  Love can Move Mountains My least favorite song on the album; very upbeat  and techno, fast, loud, and extremly annoying<br />7. To Love you More A good  song for fooling-around-with-friends type of dancing, slow and calm as  usual<br />8. My Heart Will Go On (from Titanic) You all know it<br />9. I am  Your Angel (duet with R. Kelly) A really pretty, touching song. Not as slow  as usual, but not fast either<br />10. That's the Way it Is My FAVORITE song  on this album. It is an almost-fast song, with a beat that will get you up  and dancing. It's one to sing along with, listen to while doing anything-  great job Celine!<br />11. If Walls Could talk An OK song, too upbeat and  techno for my liking<br />12. and 14. (i forget the names) These 2 sound the  same- slow and touching<br />13. All the Way 9duet with Frank Sinatra) A  REALLY touching, really good song<br />15. I want you to need me Another good,  brand-new song which will get you singing along with the stereo<br />16. Live  for the one I love A very touching, typical Celine song<br />This is a  terrific album that you will be listening to it for weeks to come!
B000002B7N|5.0|This is a great album, it's best song is &quot;Crazy Train&quot;. That song rules and so do all the others.
B000002KAT|2.0|You love 'Moondance' and you think 'It's Too Late To Stop Now' is terrific. But you've heard 'Astral Weeks' is the big one, the very zenith of Van-ness. Everyone's told you it's great, the critics routinely rave.  Here's the news: they're lying. 'Astral Weeks' is one of those Emperor's  New Clothes affairs, like the complete works of The Doors and most Stanley  Kubrick films. It's deeply, deeply boring, but because we're meant to -  like, you know - dig it, man, we all claim it's one of the most profound  spiritual experiences of our lives. It's not. It's mind-numbing hippy  tedium from a stolid Ulsterman who really ought to know better, given his  background.
0893860220|5.0|Do NOT read this book unless you want to change.  Many people like to &quot;play&quot; with spirituality but really aren't looking to make any major changes in themselves.  If you are one of those people then DO NOT  buy this book.

If you are not prepared for a total  restructuring of how you look at the world and reality then DO NOT BUY THIS  BOOK.

0930289234|5.0|I first read Watchmen in high school, and it greatly impressed me of course.  Over a decade later, I reread it and it impresses me even more.  Watchmen is simply the best thing Alan Moore has ever written, and as such,  the best graphic novel ever IMHO.  Comic book writers like Neil Gaiman, for  ex., may be more popular, but at his peak, Moore was the best writer in  terms of style, plotting, intellect and sheer cleverness to work in the  genre.  I used to think the book's only failing was Dave Gibbon's artwork,  which isn't particularly slick or &quot;pretty&quot;; however, Gibbon's  layouts were essential in conveying such a dense story, so I've changed my  mind since.<br />In summary, Watchmen is one of the cleverest, and best novels  of recent decades to appear of any genre.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 has always been a very versatile band, constantly changing their style  and yet always making music of the highest quality. &quot;Achtung  Baby&quot; definitely marks a severe change from the preceding albums, but  is simply excellent. Nine years after its release, this one is still the  band's best album, the most complete. From start to finish, all the songs  are great. I believe this album really put U2 &quot;over the top&quot;, and  confirmed them as, unquestionably, the best band in the world.
B000003TA2|5.0|Sonic Youth's 1990 offering, &quot;Goo&quot;, was neither as good as the  early masterwork &quot;Sister&quot; or the later &quot;Dirty&quot;, but  still better than the previous effort &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;.  What  really makes these albums comperable at all is the quality of Thurston  Moore's compostitions.  They often make the bulk of the album, but he went  through a period of variable quality through these albums.  &quot;Goo&quot;  finds him midway through a return to his &quot;Sister&quot;-era powerful  rockers.  His opener &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; is a welcome addition to the  Sonic canon, and sets the tone for the album as more of a  &quot;Sister&quot; continuation rather than a &quot;Daydream Nation  II&quot;.  The seventies rock styled power-chords are gone in favor of long  intro drones and crushing lo-fi guitarwork.  His next song is  &quot;Mary-Christ&quot;, which is even better, once again in the  &quot;Sister&quot; vein.  &quot;Disappearer&quot; is less of a success, but  still better than &quot;Total Trash&quot; anyway.  The closer  &quot;Titanium Expose&quot; is another great track, this a Thurston, Kim  team effort, that sums the album up well.  Thurston, however, is not the  lone hero of &quot;Goo&quot;.  Kim contributes some of her best songs in  Sonic past or present, such as &quot;Kool Thing&quot;, &quot;Cinderella's  Big Score&quot; and the dark, powerful &quot;Tunic&quot;.  &quot;Mote&quot;  is probably the best song on the album, however, as Lee Ranaldo keeps up  the high standard of quality since at least &quot;Sister&quot; or  &quot;Evol&quot; that we expect from him.  Also notable are the two  instrumental tracks, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; and &quot;Scooter +  Jinx&quot;.  Although not the best tracks, they are interesting sonic  explorations and I never find myself skipping them.  Not notable, however,  is the goofy Kim rocker &quot;Goo&quot;.  This song is almost embarrasing  to listen to, but catchy as anything they have ever recorded.  If that is  not a dirty trick, I don't know what is.  Between the pop-art cover and the  return to the &quot;Sister&quot; lo-fi energy, &quot;Goo&quot; deserves to  be considered one of Sonic Youth's top albums.rded.  If that is  not a dirty trick, I don't know what is.

B000002WYT|5.0|I know, that song was on UTTAD, but who cares? DMB is clearly the best  thing going right now, a refreshing break from the mostly putrid music of  the 90's and new millenium. In an age where Eminem cursing and Brittney  lip-synching passes as &quot;awesome&quot;, Dave Matthews Band sticks to  the timeless plan of producing actual &quot;MUSIC&quot;;you know, with  instruments and singing, the way it used to be. But what makes Dave  Matthews Band even more special is the fact that you know their unique and  special sound isn't just a product of a recording studio. Anyone who has  been to a live DMB concert knows that as great as the studio albums are,  the band live is so much better. This is a striking contrast to the  &quot;music&quot; lip-synched by N SYNC at their &quot;concerts&quot;(more  like modeling shoots with music in the background). Dave Matthews Band has  also had a very unique rise to prominence, growing in popularity through  relentless touring and a growing fan base during their early days rather  than having their music forced on to young listeners by the  &quot;all-powerful judge of what is hip and what isn't&quot;, MTV. If you  really examine music today, you would notice that most of the most popular  artists are only in that position because of their looks, not because of  the actual quality of their music. Dave Matthews is not that attractive,  but his music sure is, which is why you should buy &quot;Crash&quot; and  all of DMB's other albums so that you can save yourself from the horror of  most of today's music. Believe me, it's an investment you'll be grateful  for down the line. Please buy the album now!
B000003TA9|5.0|With tighly arranged rockers and effecient use of noise and disnonance, &quot;Dirty&quot; ups the ante on Sonic Youth's catologue.  Thurston contributes many high energy songs that would break the monotony on a  lesser album, but on this album, they set the unbeleivable pace.  &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;Sugar Kane&quot;, &quot;Theresa's Sound World&quot;  and &quot;Chapel Hill&quot; come to mind as the most notable.  Lee adds  another album highlight with &quot;Wish Fulfillment&quot;, which is more  mellow and poetic, but still rocks.  Kim's compositions are varied,  however.  &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot;  sound confused and garbled, but &quot;Orange Rolls, Angel's Spit&quot; and  the closer &quot;Creme Brulee&quot; are very strong, and some of her best.  The album flows with crushing rhythm work and loud guitar explorations.  The Butch Vig production does not make Sonic Youth into the typical grunge  band or make &quot;Dirty&quot; into the typical grunge album, but all the  instruments come out loud and clear.  They even manage to slip in the  lo-lo-fi punk tune &quot;Nic Fit&quot; in the midst of the wall of guitars  that stand on either side.  Overall, this album should not be chastised  because it was on a major label, or produced by Butch Vig, or recorded  during the heart of the grunge era, it is very good, great even.  This  album is truly great.
B00001OH7N|5.0|The Man Who Sold The World starts off with a big show of symbolism.  &quot;The Width of A Circle,&quot; I believe, is symbolism for circling the musical genres in one single song.  The instrumentation moves from one riff  to another.  It makes you think you have listened to three separate songs,  one in fact you have only heard the first track of Bowie and Ronson's first  masterpiece.  It's obvious to Bowie fans that have just a little knowledge  about his personal life that &quot;All the Madmen&quot; is written directly  about his half-brother, Terry.  Terry was, at the time of this album's  release, living at Cane Hill Mental Hospital in South London.  Terry later  committed suicide.  Many do not know what to make of &quot;Black Country  Rock.&quot;  Some say that Bowie and his friend really is Bowie's  half-brother.  And Bowie has &quot;adopted another point of view&quot; of  his half-brother.  And what view is crazy?  Terry's view on life and of the  world.  Bowie wasn't the only one changing point of views.  Terry, himself,  seemed to be jealous of Bowie's music success.  Once, when Terry had stolen  food from a local store and the owner asked him to pay for it, Terry said  to call his snotty brother.  &quot;After All&quot; seems to be a religious  song.  The chorus lyric &quot;Oh by Jingo&quot; is a euphemism for Jesus.   And they're under the influence of thoughts &quot;from paradise.&quot;   Paradise must be heaven.  Yet at the closing of the song, Bowie pleads to  you to forget all he has said.  Somewhat shy of his religious beliefs?   Bowie has said that &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot; is about a war veteran  that has a violent thirst for death.  He kills all in sight.  What a horrid  nightmare!  I'm not so sure what &quot;Savior Machine&quot; is all about.   Although I do have my opinions.  I suggest that a nation (possibly the USA)  built upon liberty, freedom, and goodwill has been destroyed and let down  by all of these good things.  Basically a world turned upside down!  This  song seems to be talking directly to his Mom about sex.  It seems to be a  personal issue, so I will stop there.  Every rock music fan seems to know  the story of &quot;The Man Who Sold The World.&quot;  It was later  performed as a tribute to David Bowie by Nirvana on Unplugged.  These  &quot;supermen&quot; guard a place that does not need guards.  They become  bored and &quot;play strange games.&quot;
B000002I4S|4.0|The album &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, title song in particular, represent the beginning of John Coltrane's high intensity soloing, based on scales rather than imbelishing the melody of the song.  His rapid pace is unbelieveable  and takes jazz to new heights from the start.  &quot;Cousin Mary&quot; is a  more standard swing tune, but is still pleasant.  &quot;Countdown&quot; is  a brilliant exploration in improvisation and is indicative of the raw  energy Coltrane would later utilize in his sixties recordings.  The other  tracks represent a more melodic take on the &quot;Giant Steps&quot;  formula, with delightful results.  &quot;Naima&quot; is a classic song,  beautiful and understated, and certainly one of Coltrane's finest moments.  The alternate take of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; is more of the same, and  nothing particularly special.  The alternate &quot;Countdown&quot;,  however, is almost twice as long as the original album version, and is  quite a treat.  This is not the best Coltrane album, but probably the best  example of his earlier sound.  His truly groundbreaking work came in the  form of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; and later group improvisational works  like &quot;Sun Ship&quot;, &quot;Ascension&quot; and the widely panned but  strangely brilliant &quot;Om&quot;.  Good, very good even, but by no means  great.  It is the example of expert playing by John Coltrane and bass  player Paul &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot; Chambers.  Excellent conversion tool for  smooth jazz listeners, too.
B00001OH7V|5.0|After Bowie and Eno's negative and lonely album called &quot;Low&quot; (still one of Bowie's best), I suspect Bowie wanted something a little more positive.  Clearly he was getting his life back on track.  He was going  through his divorce with Angie, and at the same time gaining sole custody  of his son.  The first track on &quot;Heroes&quot; discusses the famous  fairy tale of &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  The song, by the same  name, proves the fact that Bowie's mood is changing more positive.   However, I think it shows a self-absorbed Beast.  Which, is quite the  opposite of the Beast in the fairy tale.  He seems to get mad if you  comment on his appearance.  The lyric of &quot;Someone fetch a priest, You  can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast&quot; seems to show Bowie in a  possible jealous mood.  After his marriage had &quot;gone wrong&quot; Bowie  may have been jealous of lovers reaching their destiny.  Towards the end of  the song, Bowie shows his desperation of the marriage.  He appears to  wanted to believe the marriage was still alive, but he knew the reality of  it all.  &quot;Joe The Lion&quot; seems to speak for itself.  And what I  can I say about &quot;Heroes.&quot;  This song is probably the lover's  anthem of the world.  &quot;Sons Of The Silent Age,&quot; most likely my  favorite, depicts the generation calling him &quot;The Godfather of  Punk.&quot;  &quot;Blackout&quot; seems to be at first sight, a weird and  complicated song.  Once you dissect the lyrics, you realize that once again  Bowie is talking about his ex-wife Angie.  The lyric &quot;Get me to a  doctor's I've been told, Someone's back in town the chips are down&quot;  clearly is talking about the time Angie came to visit Bowie in Berlin.   Once she arrived, Bowie suffered an anxiety attack and Angie rushed him to  the hospital.  The author of &quot;We Could Be Heroes,&quot; Chris Welch,  seems to think that Bowie is debating the once hostile issue of Hitler's  V-2 rockets pointing directly at London.  A better explanation of &quot;V-2  Schneider&quot; would be that Bowie is comparing Maria Schneider's jazz to  a V-2 rocket.  A friend of mine cannot stand &quot;Sense Of Doubt.&quot;  I  can't find anything wrong with it.  I think it's very creative and would  make a great addition to a horror movie soundtrack.  &quot;Moss  Garden&quot; is also a great Bowie instrumental.  I say Bowie because it  was his idea all along for &quot;Moss Garden.&quot;  I also rally like  &quot;Neukoln.&quot;  &quot;The Secret Life of Arabia&quot; reminds me of a  fantasy world much like Aladdin Sane's 'Drive In Saturday.&quot;
B00000J7SS|5.0|This landmark jazz album can be thought of as loud, chaotic, overlong or tedious.  Those who say that, however, are missing the point.  This album is an experience, one that almost makes the song divisions trivial.  Each  song is in the same vein, heavy in instrumental interplay, minimalist  soloing, textures and long, building melodies with brilliant tension and  release.  Nonetheless, it is loud, and long, but powerful enough to fry  eggs in the other room.  This is just as raw and loud as any rock album  recorded in the same time period, packed with more emotion and energy.  The  performances are first rate, such as the way low growls of bass clarinet  will come from nowhere and entice the coming of a melodic trumpet solo.  The organ and piano interplay on &quot;Spanish Key&quot; is indicative of  the way each instrument works together, without overshadowing or sounding  forced.  It is almost as if some asteral force caused so many artists of  such calibre to stay in their place, and play for the group, not for  themselves.  Miles Davis doesn't even take a heavy-handed approach, and  indeed such jazz giants as Wayne Shorter, guitarist John McLaughlin and  Chick Corea all decide never to show off or play too hard.  McLaughlin adds  tasteful clean blues guitar lines, a far cry from the virtuosity he  displays in the early seventies with his Mahavishnu Orchestra even on his  feature, &quot;John McLaughlin&quot;.  All notes are played with an  ensemble mentality and a commitment to the creation of a powerful,  emotional piece of timeless art.  This album is the ultimate synthesis of  power, emotion, beauty and instrumental prowess.  Truly a class, and  landmark album for both jazz and rock music.
0316921173|5.0|So what exactly does happen to Hal in the interrum between the YDAU and the Year of Glad?  He didnt see his fathers murderous entertainment else he would not be able to even articulate his thoughts. Could it just be a  symptom of his Withdrawal from weed? Is it because of the barely hinted at  digging up of the grave of his father? and what exactly do they extract  from that grave that is held by hair?  How come near the end of the novel  Hal's personal map suddenly seems mirthful for no reason and beyond his  control, and his peers keep noticing the bizarre grimaces of his face? if  anyone can help me answer these question Email me!   Oh yeah, this is the  best book i have ever read etc.
B000002C1V|5.0|This album is Roger Water's speech to the world telling them that he  dosen't care if they think that he's insane.  Ever since he went to the  insane asylum after Dark Side of the Moon, the albums were not as wild and  colorful until The Wall.  And when The Final Cut came out (but without  Richard Wright), it was evident that this album would be Water's last album  because of the explosive display of his emotions towards the world,  especially in the view of the WWII generation (wanting to change the world  but too busy getting drunk; worried about nuclear war; getting past the  &quot;wiley Japanese&quot;).  Also this album was so explosive because  Water's father was a victim of WWII (died 1944).  So even though the full  PF is not on this album, the message it sends to the world is still as  powerful as DSOTM did when it came out in '73.
B00004TR2G|5.0|I am in total awe of the Anniversay CD collection of the greatest film score ever written.  I have probably listened to the original score 10,000 times in my life.  So when I received this new Anniversary edition I was a  little skeptical.  From the first note of the cd I knew I was in for  something special.  The clarity is amazing, the bass is bone crunching.  I  have seen the movie itself at least 1,000 times.  On this CD they have  added music from the film that were not on the original release that are my  favorites.  Listening to &quot;The Pier Incident&quot; I can total envision  the pier slowly turning around in the ocean to pursue it's hopeful prey.   Anyway, I could on for days.  I can guarantee that this cd will never come  out of my cd player.  If you only buy one movie soundtrack let it be this  one.  Sit back and listen to the greatest music ever written for any film.  Period!:)
0671042858|1.0|As a rule I love Stephen King...but not this time.  This book started out slow but I kept reading hoping the plot would pick up but it never happened.  If anyone besides Stephen King would have written this I would  have given up and not bothered to finish it.  If I didn't know better I  would think someone else had written this one!
B00004TDTO|5.0|I though this was an excellent movie.  This is one of the few movies that I could watch a million times and not tire of it.
B000003CKH|5.0|This CD is a must have for any one who loves to listen to good music.  I  love classical music, punk, heavy rock, alternative rock, and everything in  between and this album has it all.  Cake has an original combo that works  extremely well...a little piano, well placed trumpet, a rhythm guitar and  an amazing lead guitarist.  The bassist cranks out some crazy riffs too,  especially in the albums two &quot;hit&quot; songs--  The &quot;I will  Survive&quot; remake and &quot;Distance.&quot;  But almost every song in  the album (except for maybe one) is great.  Its one of those rare CDs that  you can pop in when you need to listen to an hour of great music.
0425170349|4.0|Having read all of the Jack Ryan novels, as well as No Remorse, I think this book is a marvelous addition to the series.  In fact, along with Executive Orders, this book I bought when it came out in hard cover, and  feel it was worth the wait and the price of admission.  With that said, I  should go into why I liked the book so much.<br />When I was in the army, my  S-4 1lt., a real go-getter, always had a Tom Clancy book under his arm.  At  the time, 1990, I had no idea why someone would read a Tom Clancy book  while they were living the &quot;real thing,&quot; so to speak.  However,  after being discharged, I am able to read on of Mr. Clancy's books and  suppress the occasional longings I have for the military life I departed.   I read and re-read the books often, and I get the same feeling of fun,  excitement, and suspense each and every time I do.  Not too many books of  this nature can make this claim with me.<br />I also admire Mr. Clancy's  research and detail.  I am no techno-weenie, but being a historian who has  researched counter terrorism, I enjoy what he is able to provide to the  reader in understandable language.  Specifically, highly plausible and  factual information  within a grand plot.   <br />So why four stars instead of  five?  Well, to be honest, this plot borrows too much upon continuing a  theme brought forth in the book, Sum Of All Fears.  Namely the means by  which the terrorists use to attack the United States.  Also, with Clancy, I  see a reluctance to allow bad things to happen to major characters within  this last book.  Yes, the terrorism hits close to home, but that is all,  just close.  I understand an attachment to characters, but these people are  the luckiest people in the world to have all of this danger strike so close  yet never hit a major character.<br />In the end, I am hooked, for good reason  I might add.  To this end, Rainbow Six is a wonderful book, even if you  have never read any of the other Jack Ryan Books.
630463949X|5.0|Like Ivan, and fortuitously, Fleetwood Mac's 'The Dance' also became the first DVD in my collection. As a recent production - rather than a 60's re-hash - it caught my eye. It had been a specially arranged  1997  production at Warner Bros Studios, and thus the music is remarkably sharp.  I was simply bowled over. Both the quality of the sound and photography is  truly astounding, and is certainly a fantastic advertisement for technology  and in particular DVD and Digital Dolby. The group certainly appeared  totally dedicated to their reunion, proven with  quality new material - and  seemed to be enjoying the experience as much as the audience. Buckingham  and Fleetwood both earned their fees for the night and if you watch closely  you will even glimpse a smile from the perpetually aloof Christine McVie -  ex-wife of bass guitarist John - towards the end, when the brass ensemble  had ensembled. And the diminutive Nicks was just great. A great DVD to  start out with - experience it yourself !
B00004U45G|5.0|Hark! Yet another loud bomb in the faces of those who jumped on the &quot;rock is dead&quot; bandwagon. Haven't we heard enough of that stale claim? For fifty years, rock has endured through nightmarish bouts with  cencorship, greedy commercialism and other enemies, but it pulled out of  that decade and blossomed into the electric religion that it became in the  60's with the advent of the first rock supergroups ever: Led Zeppelin, The  Beatles, The Rolling Stones, CSNY, the list expands infinitely onward.<br />Even after slick popsters tried to kill it it the 80's with  synthesizers, pink hair, quirky songwriting and disco, rock survived with a  vengeance, as Live At The Greek shows. This album, certainly the finest  rock album of the year, is perhaps rock's most furious call for attention  since Crazy Horse's own dobule live album, 'Weld,&quot; released in 1991.  Ironically, the tireless intensity pervading Live at the Greek hasn't blown  over the world of rock since Led Zeppelin's &quot;Physical graffitti&quot;  of 1975. How many more albums like Live at the Greek need to surface before  fans and critics alike respect rock for the undying institution that it is?  No, rock is not dead, nor will it ever be.<br />While some may have  conveniently looked the other way, one evening in the fall of 1999, Jimmy  Page, heralded as the greatest guitarist to arise from the musical  maelstrom ofthe 1960's, took to a stage somewhere in LA and tore the lid  right off of the theater. As if to top his resurrection of rock with a  glowing cherry, Page teamed up with a group of younger guys who understand,  the Black Crowes, who stolidly deny the intervention of any pop production  or commercialism into their purpose: to create raw, gritty rock 'n roll at  a time when many record executives are far more interested in calculating  the dollar signs tattooed on the legs of Britney Spears, or on the  carefully beautified faces of that ceaseless stream of &quot;Boyz.&quot;<br />As if to say &quot;to hell with all that,&quot; page strapped on his  guitar and thrashed away, Crowes frontman Chris Robinson squealed, moaned  and bellowed the old Plant anthems, while his band plucked their mandolins,  guitars and made their organs sing like it was their last hour on Earth;  just like it used to be when Hendrix danced around a stage-fire at  Woodstock, when Dylan took his amps and electric guitars to the folk  festival in 1965, when Neil Young crooned 'Hey Hey My My Rock n Roll Will  never Die&quot; to raving audiences mowing through stashes of beer and  cigarettes.<br />Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes  took to the stage one fall  evening in LA in the name of what is good, and their achievement,  documented here on Live at the Greek, stands as an altar to those long-gone  but not forgotten days when rock WAS pop music.if to say &quot;to hell with all that,&quot; page strapped on his  guitar and thrashed away, Crowes frontman Chris Robinson squealed, moaned  and bellowed the old Plant anthems, while his band plucked their mandolins,  guitars and made their organs sing like it was their last hour on Earth;  just like it used to be when Hendrix danced around a stage-fire at  Woodstock, when Dylan took his amps and electric guitars to the folk  festival in 1965, when Neil Young crooned 'Hey Hey My My Rock n Roll Will  never Die&quot; to raving audiences mowing through stashes of beer and  cigarettes. <br />Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes  took to the stage one fall  evening in LA in the name of what is good, and their achievement,  documented here on Live at the Greek, stands as an altar to those long-gone  but not forgotten days when rock WAS pop music.
0131103628|5.0|As many of the other reviews, I praise this book. This book claim it is not intended for novices, something many other reviewers have confirmed. But I think that is underestimating novices. From knowing very little about  programming (read .bat files), I became quite fluent in C by just reading  this book. It give a complete picture of the C language, ande the code  examples are (imho) clear, concise and the style is good. One thing I like  is that many of the examples are complete prgrams, something I found useful  when trying to understand the code. This is THE resource for learning C  programming. Plus, with it's good index and refernce manual, It is allso a  convenient book to keep on the desk for reference. After all this bragging,  here's the downside: This book is not meant for &quot;idiots&quot;, as C  programming language is not for &quot;idiots&quot;. You need some ability  to think structured and logical. Anyone who have trouble writing simple  shell-scripts etc. should opt for a &quot;for dummies&quot; type of book.  At last, please remember that this is a subjetive review, based on MY needs  and MY experiences, and you may not agree with me.
6305499365|5.0|Because you will be laughing so hard, you are going to have to take breaks while watching this film. It is hands down the funniest movie I have EVER seen.  &quot;Yeah, I'm doin' the drywall up there at the new  McDonalds.&quot; <br />'nuff said. watch it.
0684833395|5.0|This book is not written in the normal prose most books are and if you can  get past that, which you should, then you will find a wonderfully written  book that is one of the better anti-war books of the last century.  Heller  keeps you entertained in following the war time experiences of Yossarian,  Milo, Major Major and many more in this book that everyone should  definitely read.
B00003CWLF|5.0|An absolutely perfect performance by Chow Yun Fat as the King and a even a somewhat impressive performance by Jodi Foster as Anna. Beautiful settings  and great direction combined with the fact that they gave CYF all of the  best lines make this one of the BEST films of 1999, up there with my other  favorite, The Green Mile. I recommend that everybody see this gem of  american cinema at its finest!
6304372620|5.0|Sleepers is one of those films that has you talking about it long after it is finished.  Based on a true story, Sleepers is definately an eye-opening experience.  <br />All of the acting is fantastic, and you clearly get into  the minds of all of the characters, especially when they are young boys at  the beginning of the film.  Kevin Bacon plays the ultimate villian, taking  away their innocence.  I truly despised his character, which means that he  did his job and played his part well.<br />The young boys burried their  painful memories deep inside of them, only to confront their nemisis later  in life.  The way the friends stick together is truly inspirational, and  somewhat remarkable that they got as far as they did (Can't ruin the movie  for you).   <br />All in all, the film was exceptional and it flowed really  nicely.  Watching the horrors unfold, and then seeing the film all come  together at the end was a truly pleasurable experience.  You will not be  disappointed with this film.
6300214540|5.0|This movie is one that stays with you long after the credits roll.  I didn't even realize until recently how much of an impact it has had on me. You might think I'm trying to imitate Tom Cruise's character Maverick since  I now have moved to San Diego (home of Miramar Air Station, the setting of  Top Gun), work at a Navy base, and ride a motorcycle.  But I'm no copy-cat,  this movie inspired me to think big and go for my own dreams.
B000001ES4|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD because it is so peaceful.  It just makes you feel very relaxed and that &quot;all is right with the world.&quot;  Sometimes this is very valuable in our hectic world.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I find it rather difficult to write something bad about a movie that is one of my favorites and one I consider to be an all time classic.  But unfortunately, the first issue of Jaws on DVD is less than satisfying.   First of all, is the lack of extras.  I was expecting more than an older  'making of' feature, a trivia game, a handful of cut scenes and only two  'blooper' cuts.  With other titles like &quot;The Abyss&quot; and  &quot;Independance Day&quot; being released as dual disk, feature packed  editions with enough extras to keep you busy far longer than the runtime of  the movie itself, it seems disrespectful to &quot;Jaws&quot; that it did  not get the same treatement.  <br />Secondly, the picture can be somewhat  grainy in some places.  Like the transfer process was not in focus.  Most  of the time, it is not noticable, but there are several places where it  stands out and really catches the eye.<br />And last, I was expecting a whole  lot more from the soundtrack.  But it turned out to be rather uninspiring  and, in places, even muted and flat.  Especially during some of the action  scenes on the Orca.  It was distracting enough to me that my attention  slipped from the action of the movie to think about it.<br />Sound and picture  quality are very important to me.  Several years running projectors in the  movies sensitized me to a level that I would notice things that most would  not, so I may be over reacting.  But still, this DVD release should have  been better.  I can't help but think that it is a damn shame that it isn't.   I would still recomend it, but not with as much enthusiasm as it could  have been.
0451167716|5.0|If you haven't seen the Godfather I or II then read this.  If you have then you won't find much discrepenacy.  If you're a big fan of the movies and want to learn more then read these because there are some extras that  the movie doesn't have.  Its a good book and the fact that the movie stays  so similar only better proves that.
6302518423|5.0|I remember reading John Gielgud's obit in the New York Times this spring, and near the end, he is quoted saying that among all of his roles, his Prospero in Prospero's Books was his most satisfying.  Since I've always  liked his acting, that sent me on the trail of this film.<br />Wow!  What a  film!  First, I highly recommend that you read The Tempest just prior to  viewing this film, or at least be familiar with it--find a plot summary in  a Shakespeare book.  It will help in carrying you through the transitions,  of which there are none in this film.  <br />Second, if you are the least bit  squeamish about nudity, male and female, in films, pass over this one.  You  won't enjoy it for watching all the bodies.  <br />With that said, enjoy.   What I found fascinating about the entire film is Greenaway's  interpretation.  I really don't agree with it all (three Ariel's, in  different ages, play the sprite of fire and air), but he still pulls it off  so that it works, and I credit him for that.  Who knows?  Maybe it was all  a part of Prospero's imagination and infatuation with books. <br />Further, it  is a cinematic smorgasbord.  The camera just cannot contain all the  visuals.<br />And then there's Gielgud, he really is smooth, polished, and  enjoying himself.  I loved watching his performance because he was putting  in all the nuance, innuendo, and shades of meaning in the language, while  presenting Prospero with all dignity.
B00004TDTO|5.0|At long last, Jaws on DVD. Why did it take so long? I have watched the VHS version many times and always marvel at how poorly a really good picture can be transferred to tape. DVD makes all the difference in the world. <br />I  needn't go into how good the movie is. We all know that. But the DVD is  GREAT!
B00003CX6P|3.0|It's the late fifties, yet somehow, a copy of Miles Davis' tutu, recorded in 1986, makes an appearance. The film is visually well worth the trip, and is gripping enough to keep you interested for an hour and a half. The  problem is that it keeps going beyond that point.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I first saw Nickelback live last month when they opened for Sevendust and Creed. I was blown away by the way the MUSIC got the crowd of, probably, 25,000 people pumped. They didn't need fancy lighting or pyro. The next day  I bought their album wondering if it would have as much energy as the live  show. The answer, HELL YEAH!  All of the tracks (esp. Leader Of Men and  Breathe) are great songs in their own right and the way they transfer from  slow to mid-tempo to hardcore metal is flawless. I especially like the  acoustic version of Leader Of Men at the end of the CD. I really hope these  Canadian rockers can repeat the greatness on their next album.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Well, it seems as though no one reviewing this album actually gets the idea here. True, it does not appear to be conceptual as a whole, and the experimentation is quite apparent in places. However, the title track,  Saucerful of Secrets, is far from a collection of strange noises followed  by mellow organ music. This track IS the concept. It begins with  unorganized chaos, very ugly to listen to, very annoying and irritating.  Then a transformation occurs. A metamorphasis if you will, into a mellow,  beautiful soundscape which builds up to a point which lifts the soul  upwards and away... This song is about the life of a butterfly. From  destructive, ugly, caterpillar, to a beautiful butterfly. Once trapped on  the ground, hated by all, now flies free upon the breeze, to be appreciated  and admired by everyone. If you watch &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;, you will  notice Nick Mason wearing a t-shirt with a single butterfly on the  front..This is no accident. As with all of Pink Floyd's music, you must pay  very close attention to it to even begin to understand what's going on.  These guys are not idiots, they knew exactly what they were doing. As David  Gilmour has said, &quot;We like to puzzle people&quot;. Now, listen again  to the music, and enjoy. Also get Meddle, Echoes is brilliant! You'll have  to figure it out for yourself, it's a fun trip!
078324228X|4.0|The Hurricane is by no means a great movie.  Denzel Washington is a great actor.  His portrayl of the wrongly imprisoned Ruben &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter is simply spellbinding.  He deserved the Oscar nomination for this  performance because without him this could have been a tv movie of the  week.
0425170349|4.0|When i saw tom clancy's newest book, Rainbow six. I was excited. I'd just started reading his books and was looking forward to reading one with everyone else. Ok, now the book. The book was a standard clancy novel with  the big letdown in the middle just to make the book longer. I has no  mention of Jack Ryan at all whatsoever. The plot was decent when you didn't  know what it was but it gets really really bad. The mission parts were  fairly decent but confusing at times(like in most of his books you need to  re-read stuff). The ending was ok but clancy doesn't seem to be willing to  let some of his characters go. Even Price,Loiselle and Weber were  untouchable. He doesn't talk about the past of anyone at all. The only  really significant character he introduces is Dimitry Popov, who you should  pay attention to from page 1. Unfortunately though the book is much too  long to make a whole heap of sense afterwards. It doesn't leave any loose  ends and if your really don't want to read it but still want to be able to  follow the Jack Ryan Storyline then you can safely skip Rainbow Six.

B00004T8RK|5.0|I've never felt anything so strong in my heart, until i've listen this album. I hope Binaural won't be the last. I think this is the most beautiful rock-album i've listen in the last ten years.Only &quot;Acthung  baby&quot; (U2) was so powerful. Not light years....
B00003003R|5.0|Guns N' Roses is legendary for its live performances, and this album does that reputation justice.  Some songs I would like to see are missing, but at 2 full CDs and 4 LPs the album was long enough.  The cuts from Appetite  for Destruction especially rock, and Axl's introduction to &quot;Used to  Love Her&quot; is classic.  Although Live Era presents a sound that is  somewhat more refined than GnR's true live sound, I believe this change was  for the better, as Axl's vocals sound better than on the many available  bootlegs.
6305665680|4.0|I saw this film on HBO and I was immediately amazed by it.  I really enjoyed this movie.  The effects were impressive and Clint Eastwood's performance in this film was also a good one.  I hope that Warner Bros.  releases this film on DVD.

B00000JCRH|5.0|These songs are definitely not too long, and never for an instant become boring.  These highly intricate and ingeniously arranged songs show a true merging of passion and anger with pure musicianship and composition.  Their  knack for incorporating beautiful melodies into highly complex, high speed  thrash riffs is unmatched, as is their ability to go from pure, rage filled  power and fury (Master of Puppets, Battery, Damage Inc.) to brooding,  saddened, gut-wrenching mellancholy (Orion, Welcome Home, Disposable  Heroes, regardless of the flurried riffing, 'Heroes' contaitns moments  where it's hard to keep one's eyes dry).  My hair stands up on the back of  my neck everytime I hear a song from this album, from Cliff's beautiful  bass intro to Damage Inc., to Kirks blazing solos...this is also an alltime  air guitar/headbanging classic.  MetallicA, aslo, for reasons i can't  completely explain, have the knack for being at times very accesible, and  non-metal fans may learn to love this album too.  A milestone in music,  combining the band's youthful energy with their later musical aesthetic and  compositional ability.  Genious.  You're not a true music fan without this  album. PS~'The Thing That Should Not Be' is one of the heaviest, darkest  songs MetallicA ever did, and is an absoloute band classic, and should TOO  be on this album, just as much as any other song.
B000007NZ5|5.0|None of the other reviewers on this page seem to know what they're talking about.  Sabbath's greatest achievement is here, all pressed into one CD.  This is the very meaning of Heavy Metal:  powerful, emotive, heavy, oozing  with class and just plain impressive across the board.  The band could not  have done a finer job in my opinion.  Nothing in Sabbath's arsenal has or  ever will be as potent as this.  A true masterpiece.
B000000OQY|4.0|Lies is a combination of the four tracks of 1986's out-of-print &quot;Live! Like A Suicide&quot; EP and four new acoustic tracks.  &quot;One In A Million&quot; was controversial due to its racist content,  but &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Used To Love Her&quot; are among GnR's  finest tracks.  However, since Lies is so short, I would recommend Appetite  for Destruction and the Illusion albums first.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Fiona Apples latest CD is a work of art in progress.<br />Though she is a wonderfully talented musician, her songs get stuck in the same conformity of music impression.<br />Although I love all her songs on here, I feel she  should venture out in other avenues.  Don't get me wrong this is a  wonderful album, I would just like to here a little more diversity.<br />A  recommendation of 4 stars to this compiliation. I prefer &quot;Tidal&quot;  over this work, but &quot;Pawn&quot; still shows this woman has a long  career ahead of her.

B00001IVOR|5.0|When you say hip-hop, that sounds like the video is gonna have a buncha chicks backin' it up, and the MCs sportin' necklaces and stoned looks on their faces. But when you listen to Wu-Tang Forever, are those honestly the  images that come into your head? This is one of those works that translates  the literature of generations of science fiction writers (from H.G. Wells  to Stan Lee) and mixes with the history of China and Asia with the lives of  those in our inner cities. What other great works prove to even amount to  this? Compared to this, Enter the Wu-Tang was but a child's first words,  before growing up to become the Son of God.
068484267X|5.0|I've put off reading Angela's Ashes for a year after it's publication as the word from friends whose literary taste I trust made me feel that I wasn't in the right frame of mind to tackle this story.As the product of a  parochial school education(in junior school),I got angrier and angrier as I  relived the cruelty of the Irish nuns who strapped fear into small children  and then terrorised them with the nightmare- producing stories of the  persecution and martyrdom of early christians(except that they were ALWAYS  referred to a Catholics!) To add to his dreadful,poor little life,Francis  had the added burden of an alcoholic father who would rather drink his  wages than feed his starving,malnourished children and a well-meaning but  ineffectual mother who produced babies regularly,only to see them die. I  realise that this is a very emotional book and,undoubtedly a frighteningly  true version of a terrible life,but I still wanted to kick it across the  room to quieten my old anger!

0316779989|4.0|David Sedaris has a sick sense of humor, and he conveys it well in this book of Christmas shorts.  It opens with the extremely funny &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;, giving an insider's view of elves at Macy's.   Next comes &quot;Season's Greetings&quot;, an overenthusiastic 'family  newsletter' that spins off into satirical tangents with the unexpected  addition of a Vietnamese daughter.  &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot;  tells of young David's encounter with his father's &quot;Christmas  present&quot; ::wink::  &quot;Front Row with Thaddeus Bristol&quot; is a  theatrical review of the Christmas pageants in the elementary schools  (we've all had to suffer).  &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; is a somewhat  sickeningly funny look at a hustler trying to gather holiday special ideas.   Finally, &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot; rounds out the collection,  telling of two families who can't stop competing with each other.  I'm a  newcomer to Sedaris's wit, and the next book on my list is 'Naked'.  This  was a great way to be introduced without being overwhelmed--even if they  are Christmas stories being read in July.
0375501851|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this novel.  The author is indeed a gifted writer.  Her thoughtful handling of some difficult themes, such as religion, race, and science is impressive.  I particularly appreciated her  portrayal of the anxieties and difficulties faced by immigrants.  Her  ability to handle these themes in such a witty, and at times outright  funny, way is reminiscent of Tom Wolfe at his best.
B000002C1V|4.0|Indeed, this is Roger's greatest solo acheivement. While musically it is  amongst the weakest Pink Floyd albums, aside from Gilmour's almost  occasional guitar solos and the sax solo on the powerful &quot;The Gunner's  Dream,&quot; lyrically this record shows Roger Waters at the peak of his  powers. This isn't only my opinion; friends of mine who have served in the  Persian Gulf during the war tend to relate powerfully to Roger's message  about the shell-shock of combat veterans, the shameful way their countries  treat them, and the betrayal of such men by such leaders as the politicians  he names. [Note, younger listeners might not remember the powers-that-were  in the early 80s] In fact, fans who liked Roger's solo endeavours should  know that Roger anticipates his subsequent nuclear-war themes on the final  cut from The Final Cut. Even the weak tracks have good lyrics, and the  stronger songs more than make up. Roger Waters reportedly was and remains  proud of this work which infuriated David Gilmour at the time, and rightly  so!

0792836014|4.0|Elvis is in top form here, but not as spectactular as in the 68 Comeback Special.  The extra clips with the fan's comments are embarrassing.  I don't know why they ever made it into the film.  The sound is subpar for a  DVD.
B00004U30D|5.0|I finally saw this movie after all the hype, and realized that it was actually as good as everyone said it was! Some people commented in their reviews that the characters are all steriotypes, but I think the main point  was to show that in the past twenty years we have oversimplified and become  parodies of ourselves. All of the performances in this movie are equally  fantastic and believable. The plot is intricate and simple at the same  time. Whether you love it or hate it, American Beauty is a &quot;must  see&quot;! For those who enjoy this movie, I suggest &quot;Ordinary  People&quot;, the 1980 Oscar winner for best picture and predecessor for  American Beauty.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I heard some song on MTV a couple weeks ago by Moby and the CD got good ratings so I bought it. I listened to all of the featured song that were listed on the front cover(and sound bytes avaliable on this site)and I  couldn't find the one song that I really loved. Then I let the tracks run  and I was amazed at what I was about to take back. Each song felt like a  soundtrack for a moment in life. Whether I was speeding down the highway at  sunset or rocking to sleep at night, these songs say all that's needed to  be said for that one moment with barely using a word. Feels almost like a  soundtrack for life. I don't see how anyone could not like a beat like  Porclein (my favorite). I really like every song except &quot;Body  Rock&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot;  and strangely those are the singles  advertised.
6305622825|5.0|When I went to see this movie I really didn't know what it was about or what to expect, after it was over I knew this had to be one of the greatest  films of all time. When surfing the net I found out that this movie had  only recieved 2 1/2 stars!<br />The movie is extremely better than 2 1/2  stars, it's about insurance investigater Jin (Cathrine Zeta Jones) who is  facinated about famous theif Mac (Sean Coneray) when a famous rembrant is  stolen from a client she claims it was him and that she can seduce him into  telling all. <br />Her boss who has a crush on her assigns her the job. While  she claims to be a theif herself they join together to steal an ancient  Chineese mask.  The movie leads to the robbing of 8 billion dollars in a  Kaula Lumpour bank. <br />I highly suggest that you rent this classic caper  movie.
B00002N9ER|1.0|Both my wife and my electrician managed to break a pair of these. Unless you are really careful when setting the light in place, they give away. It's the cheapest of plastics and does not take a beating.
B00000FC5H|4.0|this album is so funky and cool i cannot stand it!  It is one of my favorite CDs -- it makes you want to get down and dance!
B00004TDTO|2.0|I was really disappointed in the outtakes and the overall surround sound.  2 outtakes that are not amusing and what surround sound?  not sure what the professional rating of 4 on sound was listening to but there were many  missed opportunities for effects here.  I wasn't expecting great but  definitely wasn't expecting so poor.  I have the DTS version on order and  had rented the 5.1 dvd.  I just hope the surround format makes a better  transition.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is really good. I had expected it to sound like Korn, and it  really doesn't. It is sort of in the same genre as Korn and Limp Bizkit,  but does some really crazy stuff with their music. The drummer and  percussionists are great, the bassist, DJ, and guitarists are good too, and  Corey is as talented as Jonathan Davis when it comes to vocals. One  downside - you really need the lyrics sheet sometime. Still, buy it if you  like good rock.
B000002A3T|5.0|After of the recording of the Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987 the Division Bell has become the second production of the band without the great Rower Waters, in this production you can find an excellent work, this  lyrics almost produced by David Gilmour show a deep message in every song,  a great characteristic of Pink Floyd. The recording have an excellents  instrumentals songs like Cluster One and the great Marooned, and also  excellents songs like What Do You Want Fron Me, the powerfull High Hopes  and one of my favorites Coming Back To Life. The Division Bell show in  every song a deep message and evolution of one of the most important  progressive rock band in the history of the music. This recording is also  important because you can see the great way that the band is direct by an  excellent musician and composer David Gilmour, who gave in every production  an excellent quality and a the most important a message for the life.
B000021XR5|5.0|STP might have played pretty for baby on their first 2 releases, then went total pop for Tiny Music, but then they decided, &quot;Screw what radio wants, screw trying to fit into some ridiculous &quot;grunge&quot; or  &quot;alternative&quot; stereotype, let's rock.  And they do.  Finally.  No  pretentions, this one just feels cleaner than the rest.<br />Don't get me  wrong, I liked Core, and Purple, but this doesn't have any major-label,  alt-radio-friendly cliches present.  It's honest, and it rocks harder than  anything they've done.  So if you wanna hear Interstate Love Song for the  5000th time, turn on your radio and shut your mind.  But if you want to  hear STP get closer than they've ever been to real rocknroll, and not  glossy radio-friendly garbage, this one's for you.  It's just a shame  Scott's still got troubles with the law.
0792838068|5.0|This film is not for most people; it's very morose and gruesome at times, and it won't be entertaining and satisfying in the same way most mainstream movies are.  It does however provide a very shocking and revealing look at  the lives of a hopeless drunkard and a lonely prostitute.  <br />Nicholas Cage  and Elizabeth Shue are superb portraying their characters and their skill  is the driving force of the film.  That isn't to say, however, that the  directing, music, and screenplay weren't excellent as well.  <br />One  particularly important aspect of the film is the relationship that forms  between Cage and Shue.  Some reviewers describe it as sincere love,  however, I don't agree.  Both Cage and Shue are desolate and vulnerable.   The natural thing for both of them to do when they meet is to seek refuge  in each other.  Shue might love Cage, but it's more out of desparation for  company than what she sees in him.  Cage's interest in Shue is somewhat  more confusing.  Before his introduction to Shue, I got the impression that  he was completely detatched from anything earthly.  The relationship he  maintains with Shue suggests otherwise though.  I'm not really sure, yet,  what to make of Cage.<br />I never really knew what alcohol could do to a man  until seeing this movie. Sure, a random drunk on the street is a common  sight, but most people, who don't have a friend or family member with the  problem, don't realize the extreme extent to which the obsession can  develop.  I'd recommend this film to anyone older than 17.
B00000HZFH|4.0|when i first heard this album i seriously wanted to drop my guitar and  never touch it again.  i didn't not want to create anything musically cuz  this album had it all and i was unbelievably jealous: the sound, the  lyrics, everything.<br />after a while i could pick up the guitar and grew  slightly tired of the cd.  but songs like time trap, center of the universe  and carry the zero are still fantastic songs.<br />i would give this cd 5  stars, but i have to give it 4 cuz Doug Martsch is an evil genius and  making me want to quit playing the guitar.
B0000296SI|1.0|Although many people seem to think that this album is a developmental step and worthy of its accolades, if you listen to any other smaller poppunk bands you will hear the same sound with superior vocals and better energy.  The whole album is overly polished and smoothed to be just homogenous  enough for the pop-listening audience it appeals to. Support a local  poppunk scene and you will hear much better things. I listen to crustpunk,  but, from the days when I enjoyed poppunk, I can suggest Youth Ahead, 5  Cent Deposit, LWL, Lanemeyer, Weston, Plan-A, Ann Beretta, Bigwig, or any  number of other bands that haven't sold out and retain a great, infectious  sound. To listen to Blink is ordinary and conformist in an extremely  unappealing way. Investigate further; this album is not particularly  interesting and no poppunk band is worth Blink's ticket prices.
B000002L9Y|5.0|Christine McVie's songs,&quot;Little Lies,&quot;and &quot;Everywhere,&quot; are the high points of this record.They said Stevie Nicks never showed up for the recordings,and her voice was mixed in after  she heard the album. I love &quot;Seven Wonders,&quot; but that's the only  good song from Stevie. &quot;Big Love,&quot; is a classic,and I thought the  video  was so cool,how at the end, the film goes backwards to the  begining.Everyone thought it was Stevie's grut on this cut,but it was  Lindsey's girlfriend.I seen Fleetwood Mac when they toured with &quot;Tango  in the Night,&quot;but without Lindsey Buckingham.They were still  fantastic.I remember some guy running on stage to grab Stevie.She was so  cool ,Stevie kept on singing while the security guards caught the guy.I  hope this isn't the last CD of new material from  Fleetwood Mac.It was the  greatest night of my life when they got back together for there MTV reuion  album,&quot;The Dance.&quot; Stevie's in great shape,and I'm sure the next  record will be a huge hit.
0671042858|4.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King movies, but I haven't read much of his novels.  This is only the second novel by him that I have read.  I found it a very simple and very exciting novel.  It's about a girl who gets lost in  a forest, but she realizes she is not alone.  It's very excellent and it  will take you only a day to read it.
B000002KD5|5.0|Fleetwood Mac made the best move ever by taking on Stevie and Lindsey,even though Christine McVie's a powerfull songwriter and singer also.I've never even heard of Fleetwood Mac untill this record came out.I got this album  after &quot;Rumours.&quot; Everyone was talking about &quot;Rhiannon.&quot;  They were suppose to make a movie about this song,but nothing ever came of  it. &quot;Landslide&quot; is my favorite ,but Christine had the big hits  with &quot;Say you Love me,&quot; and &quot;Over my head.&quot; This was  the begining to one of the greatest groups to come out of the 70's,and I  hope its not the End.
B000000W5B|5.0|Nobody ever thinks of this album as one of the Stones greatest, but I  think it defintely is.  Every song on here is great except for,  &quot;Dancing With Mr. D&quot;, if you ask me it gets boring.  In my  opinion, &quot;Star, Star&quot; is the best one on here, it has great  lyrics.
B000002KLZ|5.0|This Live album is great.Fleetwood Mac sings all of there hits,but wait untill you hear &quot;Landslide.&quot; Stevie's voice was ready to give out,but it sounds so different from the way Nicks usually sings this  number.I've seen Fleetwood Mac live twice,and I didn't want the concet to  end.I remember thinking the show was over,and all of us were running to are  cars to avoid the Pittsburgh traffic,then all of a sudden we heard  Christine singing,&quot;Songbird.&quot;Everyone ran back in to hear this  beutifull ballad. After you play this 1980 CD,put in the 1997 live record,  &quot;The Dance.&quot;They sound just as good,maybe even better.
1573226521|3.0|I liked this book. In fact I really, really liked this book up until... the last 100 pages when everything seems to come loose and Garland appears to be running out of steam. You know the bit I'm talking about... where all  the dope guards come down on to the beach threatening its inhabitants and  then abrubtly leaving? Highly improbable and unbelievable-the over  dramatic, rushed and almost scatty ending really does taint my impression  of the rest of the novel which provides high paced, fairly exciting and  quick reading. For example, the guards drop five corpses on the beach as a  warning. Yes the people are tripping and yes they are all slighlty on the  edge but for them all to start ripping the corpses to bits? It was almost  laughable- and the meaningless subplots? Sub plots are meant to add depth  to a novel and these subplots needed to tied up to prevent them becoming  loose ends. The Swedish fiasco for example-where does that tie in to the  rest of the storyline-in fact the storyline was so loose that at times it  felt as if the book was ambling along all by itself with no one powering  it. I just felt really let down after spending two days reading it-what an  anti climax.<br />Maybe I am being a little harsh, I understand that this is  Garland's first novel, and yes maybe my harshness is due to the amount of  publicity it has received after the release of the film starring  Dicaprio(which I haven't seen yet) but I think this novel could have been a  whole lot better. Needless to say I did enjoy it but I wish I had saved it  for the beach.Afterall, it remains,in my mind at least,a holiday read.
B00003CWRX|5.0|The Insider easily accomplishes 2 things- it gets my vote for best film of 1999 &amp; for best Michael Mann film ever ( and thats saying alot coming from the man who made Last of the Mohicans,Theif,Manhunter...). This movie  not only shoots Crowe to superstar status as the brooding informer ( and I  thought he shined in La Confidential!), but also managed to get a  performance out of Al Pacino that I thought was forever lost! Pacino is so  low keyed, and so relentless in his pursuit of the truth that he harkens  back to the days of his best roles such as Serpico&amp; Dog Day Afternoon  with his character! He eschews the over the top, scene chewing performances  that have plagued him since Scarface, thru Dick Tracy, to Devils Advocate!  After watching this film I wanted to write/email the real Wigand, harass  the tobacco company, voice my disappointment at 60 minutes! It inspired me  to civil duty! What higher praise for a movie?
6305842442|2.0|Please don't let my rating fool you. This is an awesome specticle of a movie - and probably my most favorite of all time. The potential of this boxed set is missed by a fair margin though. It does include a lot of hard  copy material (folded poster, lobby cards, film cell), but it misses out by  simply dropping in the Director's Cut version of the movie and not  including the original theatrical release, or the the color storyboard info  from Syd Mead's production design (found in the Criterion LD). These  additions would make it more the difinitive release for true movie buffs.   There's also several minutes of reconstructed footage (Holden's hospital  scenes) that could be included - or even still shots that I know are out  there, screen tests for the actors and SFX test shots. This should have  been better put together.  It does inlcude the screenplay - although its  missing some pages that were apparantly missing from the original copy  (there really isn't a complete copy, but it could've been reconstructed  better than this). Some of the missing material still exists in the  &quot;Illustrated Blade Runner, '82&quot; sketchbook. Whoever put this  package together should have done their homework or called Ridley Scott, or  Paul Sammon (Future Noir). I hope Criterion will put out their version on  DVD  someday .
B00004TJTS|2.0|I hate to report that about any family movie since there are so few made, however, this film seemed to have taken a cue from the depressing films of 1999 (boys dont cry,american beauty,etc...)The length to which this  director went to show human tragedy, albeit a real story, was far beyond  what should have been put in a child's movie! This film had my 8 year old  girl in tears so many times I must've gotten up to turn it off 5 times!The  acting is fine and the syubject material is real, but lets not bill this  film as the &quot;feel good family movie&quot; you see in commercials where  the cute little dog is driving &amp; doing tricks! It's very misleading!  Parents,Skip Skip!
B00004R99L|4.0|Because of critics' reaction to Alice in Wonderland in 1951, it is written, Walt Disney actually apologized for the movie and soon after his television show became a hit a few years later, he showed it in its  entirety on TV, thus relegating it to his &quot;minor film&quot; category.  The movie has never been able to shake this image, and that is a shame. We  should remember that &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; wasn't a giant box office hit  in 1939, and only after it was made an annual event on television did it  become a classic in the eyes of the public. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;  deserves far more attention than it has ever received. The characters are  wonderful. The music is humable, even singable. It's a short film that  takes the viewer into a dreamland, and Disney's animated version stands up  against any of the other live versions that have popped up over the years.  It's time to give this movie the credit it deserves as a classic in  animation. Watch it from a child's point of view, with the amazing images  of a cat that disappears, talking cards, and Alice constantly growing and  shrinking. And then enjoy it as an adult for the dream world into which we  are all swept. And furthermore, the DVD transfer is fantastic, with as many  extras as one will find on a Disney non-special edition disc. Take another  look at this one and be swept away.
078324228X|3.0|When the AFI released their 100 top movies of the millenuim in 1999, someone asked me, now that the old time greats like Bogart,Fonda,and Stewart were gone, who would be remembered in the next century. I remeber 2  of my answers; one was Harrison Ford and the other Denzel Washington. While  Ford has had a string of mediocore roles of late, Denzel continues to prove  why he's a real &quot;heavyweight&quot; in movies! His performance in the  Hurricane only re-inforces my beleif!Not only does he turn in a performance  that was well worthy of oscar nomination in 99,much like the fury and  passion he showed in Malcom X, but he rose above what I would have to call  the less than superb writing in this film. He gave a truly emotionally  stirring performance, first in his breakdown in his prison cell, to the  hardening of his will in order to serve his sentence, to his reluctant  acceptance of help from outsiders in his bid for freedom.The story itself  seems a bit contrived, although supposedly based on true events. Except for  washington's performance, it would come off as just another &quot;hopeless  cause overcomes&quot; movie ( my apologies to Leiv Schreiber who was also  &amp; always wondeful).What really strikes me, however, is how this film  confirms the old adage of the more this change the more they stay the  same.In our so called enlightened society, we seem to still be plagued by  the same prejudices that pervaded 60's Patterson NJ.One last thing that  bothers me is that I saw Denzel Washington having to defend himself from  outraged viewers while promoting this movie! While I would never condone  the freeing of a guilty man, it is an actors choice to chose any role they  want to portray, regardless of their own feelings and popular opinion.  That's their job. If people didn't beleive in the content of this movie  then they should've banned or boycotted, not bothered the actors. That's  THEIR constitutiional right!
0790736918|5.0|A masterpiece. This is by far John Wayne's best performance and it was sheer ignorance on the part of the Academy Awards that Wayne wasn't  nominated for best actor.  Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, is one of the  most interesting characters in the history of film. Returning to his  brother's homestead three years after the Civil War, Ethan is a mysterious,  suspicious man whose motives for coming home are unclear.  Where did he get  that newly minted Yankee money? And why did he take off before the war  anyhow?  Ethan and his sister-in-law, Martha, evidently had something going  on before the war and she obviously still adores Ethan in a very chaste  way. I find the scene where Martha gives Ethan his cape one of the most  touching on film. Ward Bond's character witnesses this exchange between  Martha and Ethan and sensitively looks away.  Did he know of their love in  the past?       After the two girls are kidnapped by the Commanches, Ethan  sets out to rescue them. Over time, he realizes that the surviving girl is  by now living with 'a buck'. Ethan's new quest is to kill his niece.   Astute critics have pointed out that Ethan's miscegenation is the driving  force behind his obsessive search.  The Searchers is referenced in two of  Martin Scorcese's films.  It is one of Stephen Spielberg's favorite movies.  The French director Jean Luc Goddard says that he weeps when Ethan lifts  Debbie up near the end.  A beautiful, profound film that simply goes over  the heads of some people who refuse to believe that a Western can be great  cinema. There's plenty of flaws and goofs (why are people homesteading in  what is essentially a desert?) but it's still a great film.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Every time I listen to some early Clash, I always think the same thing.  &quot;These are the same guys that made London Calling?&quot;  Not to disrepect the Clash's early work, because it is great in it's own right.   But the first two albums weren't as much of a call to battle as this one  was.  Every time I listen to this album, I want to go change something.  Or  at least start to make myself more aware of the world that surronds me.  I  don't want to become another lost soul &quot;working for the clamp  down.&quot;  Even the cover art inspires me to raise a clenched fist in the  air.   The first two albums weren't as boldy experimental as this album  was.  For those of you who complain that The Clash sold out, you're missing  the point.  Part of the philosophy that spawned punk rock was that any one  could be a musician.  On this album, The Clash was acting on that  philosophy by branching out into other musical arenas.  They didn't want to  pigeon hole themselves into playing three chord rock for the rest of their  lives. In the end, the music speaks for itself.  That's all that needs to  be said.
B00004T9UF|5.0|well.. compared to his last album i think is better and worse at the same time. All the songs on the slim shady lp were great, most of the songs on the marshall mathers lp are excellent but it is let down by one or two  below standard.  &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; i think tells us what he is  really thinking the most.  &quot;Stan&quot; shows his writing skills are  still there, not his usual style but it works really well. &amp; &quot;Kill  You&quot; probably wont be released because of the lyrics but is funny and  brings back eminem's distinctive style. One of the best albums you could  buy, get it now if you dont already.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Like all good bands, Pearl Jam is a band that isn't going to put out the same album over and over again. As they mature, so too does the music.Sonically, this one is close to No Code, but still different. The  rock songs still rock, but whereas they were once cathartic, now they are  more in a garage-style, gritty vein. The slower songs now have more texture  and depth to them, and the production gives the music a more fuller feel  than on previous albums. This is not an album that is easy to get into the  first time you listen to it. It requires repeated listenings. No, it's not  Ten, but then again, they're not 22 anymore either. My only complaint about  this is the song order. It starts out with three up-tempo songs and the the  rest of it is dominated by the slower, more moody songs. It gives the album  an unbalanced feel to it.
B000023VR6|4.0|dr dre knows what he's doing and he's proved it, two great singles; still d.r.e &amp; forgot about dre and these are the best two songs on the album, and are the reason i got it. all the other songs have the quality you would  expect from dre, but are nothing special, the album is good but i found it  really hard to listen to all the way through as the songs start to sound  really similar after a while. more variety is needed on this one..
0688171664|1.0|Do you enjoy the intellectual depth that greeting cards provide?  How about the careful thought that bumper stickers demonstrate? Are you excited by windbags, braggarts, pedants, and Mr Know-it-alls?  Do you drool at the  thought of yet another dispatch from the me generation, the baby boomers?    If so, this book will thrill you.  If not, in other words, if you enjoy  challenging reading and original thinking you will find this tome dull,  cliche-ridden, pretentious, and authoritarian.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I bought this cd because of the two singles, what's my age again and all the small things.  They were the singles but after listening to the album, any two could've been chosen. Every song has quality and not one lets the  album down. My favourites are dumpweed, adam's song and what's my age  again. But i like them all and this album is one of the best i've ever  bought
6304240554|4.0|The world population has been infected by a disease that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Four humans have decided to escape the plague by escaping in a helicopter. They end up landing at a zombie infested shopping  mall and its up to them to use the proper survival tatics to stay alive.  This is actually a horror movie with  a plot, not just some gore loaded  splatter movie. Even if your not a horror movie fan, this one might  actually appeal to you, because it has a dramatic mood to it. Its actually  horror mixed with adventure and drama. Written and Directed by George A.  Romero (Night of the Living Dead).
6305232660|3.0|47(!) years earlier (in 1951), George Pal produced &quot;When Worlds Collide.&quot;  The premise of this film was that the earth would be destroyed by collision with another celestial object, and that only a  select few (and how they are selected forms the core of the film) could be  saved.  Is this starting to sound vaguely familiar?<br />About the only  improvement I can see in the last half century is that the wonderfully  gifted Morgan Freeman is cast as U.S. President -- an idea that would have  been unthinkable in 1951.  The only reason I mention this is because most  viewers of the movie I talk to never noticed Mr. Freeman's race -- only his  absolute credibility as the President of a nation in crisis.  So, to  contradict my subject line, I guess things DO change, after all.<br />In any  case, the question of how we as a species would deal with our own  individidual and collective exinction is a profound one that deserves more  thoughtful treatment than it received in either of these films.
B00004TJKI|5.0|An excellent courtroom drama that revolves around a murder case in the small Michigan town of Thunder Bay.  <br />James Stewart portrays a small town attorney defending a army sargent accused of killing his wife's rapist.   Tense and surprisingly adult in its subject matter and dialouge, this Otto  Preminger film features a great score by Duke Ellington and beautiful black  and white cinematography.<br />Most of the film takes place in the courtroom  and a real judge, not an actor, presides over the trial.  A young George C.  Scott portrays the ambitious, right wing prosecutor and Ben Gazzara is the  accused.  Lee Remick is the rape victim and the owner of the infamous  panties, a key piece of evidence.<br />It's a great film that features an  outstanding performance by Stewart.  Don't pass it by.
6305537798|4.0|An unconventional and very loose adaption of The taming of the Shrew. There are the typical stereotypes of teen age life. the standout is Heath Ledger's antihero. The standout moment...his rendition of You're Just Too Good To Be True....a real show stopper. Some good ensemble acting, though hindered by the script. A real guilty pleasure.
B000000WA4|5.0|if you like the smashing pumpkins then you will love this cd it is one of my favorites it has a mixture of their heavy rock and thier soft melodys i have liked this cd since i was in the 2nd grade it is the best
B00004TDRD|5.0|I cannot describe how happy I am to have my favorite summer movie reissued and expanded upon. Bruce (the name all us lifeguards gave the shark) is the ultimate \\"things that go bump in the dark\\" monster. The picture quality is great and the sound has been enhanced. All the additions were apparently made under the supervision of Spielberg. This is a movie classic and a must have for any collection.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|My Dog Skip is a wonderful movie for anyone who is crazy about animals in general, dogs in particular.  Frankie (the kid), Moose and Enzo (the JRTs) all did great jobs acting in this film. I know it was based on a true  story, but still I was shocked by the one violent scene (be reassured: the  dog survives!)--and the ending!  The last 5 minutes were viewed through  teary eyes. When the mom helped the old dog get onto the kid's bed--well I  still get choked up remembering that scene. I don't know how I drove home  from the theater; I was crying all the way--I was missing my 2 dogs who are  waiting for me at the Rainbow Bridge, and I couldn't wait to get home to my  current 2 canine companions and give them hugs and kisses and treats. I  knew that I would be adding this movie to my video library as soon as it  came out on VHS. This is a must see film!
6305892806|2.0|Of al the recent adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this is the real disappointment. It lacks the integrity of Persuasion and the grand sweep of the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. There is a sense of disjointedment....very uneven story telling. A big disappointment, since it had so much to work with and could have been so much better.
B00004TDTO|4.0|This is the movie that created the term Summer Blockbuster,and it's not hard to see how this film could have influenced movie making into what we know today.It has a terrific script,great direction from Spielberg,a  fitting cast and great thrills.The only thing holding  back this DVD  release from becoming THE movie to buy are the really dated and fake  looking shark effect;after seeing movies such as Deep Blue Sea,Jaws's white  shark looks like a Muppet Show doll!Still,this is a great film,no doubt  about it.Now if only someone would update those special effects like they  did with the Star Wars trilogy(special edition)..hmmmm
0553210246|4.0|At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages.  But  the story is more than the blurb on the back cover.  It is about betrayal,  last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect  you 21 years down the road.  Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through  Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.<br />Like many of  the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book.  There are constant  turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it  into the depths of depression.  This book is not an easy read though.  There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry,  but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.<br />I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_  that made me buy this book.  Enjoy!
0316777722|5.0|The typical problem with humor is that it appeals only to certain groups; while one group finds a work the pinnacle of intlect, another may find it a pile of stewing unamusement.  Sedaris writes fairly universally-appealing  humor.  His essays are very clearly written, witty and even insightful.  He  has displayed his capabilities very well with this work
B000002JSR|1.0|Actually I would have given this 0 stars, but the menu didn't allow that. This album should never have been released. No serious Zeppelin fan could enjoy this garbage. A similarly bad album is &quot;In through the out  door&quot;. Led Zeppelin was over after Houses of the Holy. Physical  Graffiti was also pretty bad - with the exception of Kashmir (which was  probably left over from Houses of the Holy). Too bad the record company  felt it necessary to try and make some money off fans who would blindly buy  anything with Led Zeppelin's name on it. I don't imagine Amazon is going to  post this review - since it certainly won't help to sell any copies of  this. At least they let you preview the songs; so don't take my word for  it, listen yourself to how bad this stuff is.
0060975768|5.0|Gen. Moore and Mr. Galloway have written an incredible narrative of the first major setpiece battle, and arguably one of the most fierce.  Yet, for all the writing, the part of the book that moved me the most was that the  book opens with a roll call of the men who died on the field.  This was a  very powerful opening for me, and I found myself flipping back to the  beginning of the book each time the death of an individual soldier was  documented.  Gen. Moore is an honorable man to the end.  He stops short of  criticizing his chain of command, despite the constant drainage of manpower  and resources just prior to the Cav's deployment to Vietnam.  A true  soldier.  The Cav was handicapped from the start, yet they fought bravely  and did not give up.  This book is a must for any military historian.  It  is an excellent case study of the war in Vietnam, and it is extremely well  written and documented.
1558908498|4.0|Although Scream was a better film,  Scream 2 is nearly as fun.  Scream 2 has all the main survivors from the first one returning and Liev Schrieber, who only had a tiny part in Scream as Cotton Weary.  He is a welcome to the  cast.  He is a terrific actor and deserves the much bigger role he has in  Scream 2 and as people have seen a more significant role.  Added to the  cast include Jada Pinkett, Jerry O'Connell, and the noxema girl.  There is  one true difference in this one from the original, this one has more humor  than scare.  But still is a treat.  GRADE: B+
B000008DA5|4.0|The reaction you will have to these albums will depend on the type of Beach Boys music you prefer.  Smiley Smile, the substitute for Smile  (many say Smile would have been the greatest album ever) is....interesting.   Songs like &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; and &quot;Little Pad&quot;  demonstrate what happens to the human mind when drugs are introduced to it.   &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;  demonstrate what happens when a musical genius is introduced to a recording  studio and allowed complete artistic freedom.<br />Wild Honey is a great,  although quite short album.  It appears that Brian Wilson gave up trying to  produce great songs, and instead the group made decent songs.  The  difference is clear if you compare Wild Honey with Pet Sounds.  On Pet  Sounds, Wilson used a lot of studio musicians to capture the sounds he  heard in his head. On the other hand, on Wild Honey, it appears the band  just tried to do  the best they could - on their own.  The results are  good, but not excellent.<br />I recommend this album because it symbolizes the  musical fork in the road that the Beach Boys faced in the late '60's.  Did  they choose the right path?  I don't know.
630521610X|5.0|This self-aware horror movie has single-handdedly saved the horror genre, which was going to the brink of stupidity.  Kevin Willianson's first major script may be considered his best one to date.  And teaming up with Wes  Craven was a wise choice, who created A Nightmare on Elm Sreet, which was  the scariest film of the eighties.  It has great character development,  plot, and acting, yes, I said acting.  It is rare a scary movie has it,  but, fortunately Scream, it does.  The best performances are Courtney Cox,  Neve Campbell, and especially David Arquette.  Although, the smartest  character is Randy, and probably my favorite too.  The movie is pure,  undeniable fun.  GRADE: A
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall apart was a great book with some confusing names however. This didn't take away from anything. I liked the culture discussed. It seemed like I was a part of the tribe. The end is great. Don't give up on the book  because you'll miss it.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book because I saw 5 people reading it who couldn't put it down, neither could I! Although it has some &quot;uncomfotable&quot; scenes, it's very, very well writen. It's hard to believe that an older person can write in the state of mind that all teenagers think in. I've  read 3 times so far and it still hasn't lost it's touch. I applaud Steven  Chbosky for his extremly gifted talent Bravo and read this book!

B00000634J|5.0|As a serious Lennon fan, I have all his albums on vinyl, cassette and CD. I still bought this because it encompasses all of this greatest songs in one convenient package. Most of John's solo efforts were uneven, and none  of his solo albums is devoid of filler songs except &quot;Plastic Ono  Band,&quot; his first solo effort.<br />If you just want to sample Lennon's  work this is the perfect CD for you. It takes all of this stellar work from  1970-1980 and puts it on one disc. He was a genius. Enjoy!
0064400557|5.0|I have read this book a number of times, ond loved it everytime!  It is a wonderful tale of an uncommon friendship, overcominghardship, and believing in yourself and your own worth. Watching the movie &quot;Babe&quot; reminded me of this book, but &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; has so much more!  A great book for young and old!

6305546797|5.0|In 1963 a young Michael Myers brutally murdered his older sister. After 15 years in a mental hospital, he escapes. This time he's after his kid  sister, Laurie Strode. The nightmare never ends...<br />\\"Halloween\\" is one of  the few horror movies I can accept as a standard horror movie. It was  original when it was released back in 1978. But unfortunately it spawned  several useless sequels. The sequels were both gross and stupid, and it  didn't seem to catch the spirit that \\"Halloween\\" had.<br />Anchor Bay recently  released a new version of \\"Halloween\\" on DVD. This version has been fully  restored and the sound is digitally remastered. The result is breathtaking.  The transfer looks like the movie was shot yesterday and the sound is  amazing.<br />There are some really valueable extras on the DVD. There's a  documentary called \\"Halloween Unmasked 2000\\" which features interviews with  the director and the cast. I really wished that there was a interview with  the late Donald Pleasence for obvious reasons. Recommended to all Halloween  fans.
B000002UAU|5.0|Please Capitol, take a cue from the success of the Yellow Submarine Songtrack and John Lennon's remastered Imagine and re-release Sgt. Pepper and the entire Beatles catalog remastered! Please give Sgt. Pepper the Pet  Sounds treatment with stereo and mono versions on the same CD and extensive  liner notes like Pet Sounds has. And how about a Sgt. Pepper Sessions box  set? The stuff on Beatles Anthology 2 was very nice, but there has got to  be more in the EMI vaults than that. If The Beach Boys deserve it, then  certainly the greatest rock band ever deserves it also. The old 1988  release just isn't going to do it anymore. This great work of art deserves  better.<br />As, for the album itself, what can I say? It's one of the best  albums of all time. If I thought otherwise, I (and tons and tons of other  music fans) wouldn't be clamoring for a remastered version.
6305910103|5.0|&quot;Men make history, not the other way around.&quot;  Harry S Truman<br />Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan strikes the perfect balance of drama, action, humor, pathos, and depth.  After the critical failure of the  first Star Trek movie, the producers took the trouble to view every episode  of the original series to figure out what made it special--they replicated  it successfully in The Wrath of Khan.  The plot is driven by the actions  and motivations of the characters, not the other way around.  This is not a  story about spatial anomolies or an excuse for technobabble and flashy  special effects.  This story is about the classic themes which have served  drama well since ancient Greek theatre: the quest for vengeance; lost  loves; the alienation, anger and reconciliation of fathers and sons; and  the realization of mortality.  Of the many science fiction films I have  seen, few have tugged at the heartstrings as deeply as The Wrath of Khan.  The most powerfull moments are the bittersweet reunion between Kirk and  Carol Marcus, the death of Spock and Kirk's eulogy, and the long delayed  embrace between Kirk and his estranged son David.  These moments are so  universal that any &quot;science fiction&quot; label for this film seems  limiting.<br />The script is helped by what is undoubtedly William Shatner's  finest performance as James T. Kirk.  Shatner brings the perfect balance of  bluster, brio, and vulnerability to the aging Admiral.  Toward the end of  the movie, Kirk, shattered by Spock's death, tears down his defenses and  allows us to see the human being behind the uniform.  Ricardo Montalban, in  a blood thirsty, Ahab-like performance, proves there is more to his acting  than what was seen on Fantasy Island.<br />The special effects, which are  entirely at the service of the story, for the most part hold up remarkably  well--one exception is the Ceti Eels, which look rather primitive by  today's CGI standards.  James Horner's crisp, vibrant score hints at the  great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been  used in more recent Star Trek fare.<br />Paramount's transfer is good, but  not quite on the same level visually as the other entries in the series.  The print, in a few places, shown signs of wear.  The sound is very well  balanced, with plenty of impact during explosions.  The theatrical trailer  is included.nts at the  great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been  used in more recent Star Trek fare.  <br />Paramount's transfer is good, but  not quite on the same level visually as the other entries in the series.

B00003CWL5|4.0|A very unusual and strangely haunting film, `American Beauty' starts off by depicting a seemingly `normal' scenario (an ordinary neighbourhood, an everyday suburban family) and then gradually peels the layers off to reveal  the subversiveness that lies within. It's protagonist Lester Burnham is an  archetypal middle aged family man who has been letting his life chug along  for the past so many years...until inspiration, in the unlikely form of lust  for his teenage daughter's nubile friend, sparks new life into him, and he  begins the process of rebelling against the monotony of his existence. This  is, of course, a sore inconvenience (to put it mildly) to people around  him, not least to his wife, a fanatically, obsessively organized real  estate dealer. Drawn into the fabric of the plot are the Burnhams' new  neighbours - a strange, intense young man with a fascination for Lester's  daughter and for photography, and his domineering, violently conservative  ex-armyman father.  A rich cast of characters and, fittingly, a cast of  performers that more than do them justice. Kevin Spacey's remarkable  talents find their full expression here, in an extremely difficult and  courageous role. Annette Bening is better than one had ever imagined she  could be, the underrated Thora Birch and Mena Suvari are outstanding, and  Chris Cooper, that brilliant, understated actor, is superb as the martinet  father next door. Wes Bentley is very impressive too...but he will have to  prove himself in more varied roles in the future. For all its serious and  disturbing concerns, `American Beauty' is an immensely entertaining film.  Somehow, it manages to be unreal, often very theatrical (director Sam  Mendes is predominantly a theatre person) without ever seeming overdone or  obvious. There are laughs aplenty - mainly as the audience goes along with  Lester, taking malicious pleasure in his digs at conventionality and  orderliness - and only later, in retrospect, can we realize that wewere  really laughing at ourselves. For `American Beauty', despite its very  endemic title, is really the story of what modern life has degenerated  into. It's quite possible that even the filmmakers themselves meant it as a  satire on American values and lifestyle...yet, the film is full of moments  that each and every one of us can identify with. Take, for instance,  Lester's impassioned appeal to his wife - `IT'S ONLY A COUCH!\\" - when, on  the brink of a rare moment of intimacy, she shouts to him not to spill  champagne on the expensive furniture piece. Without ever adopting a preachy  or self-righteous tone, this film speaks volumes on subjects like  alienation, self-awareness, tolerance, and complacency - themes that are  perhaps even more crucial today to our part of the world than to the  audiences the movie was made for.
B000007OY0|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption definitely rates as one of the best movies of all time. Adapted from a short story by Stephen King, the movie is about how hard prison life can be. Frank Darabont( Director of the Green Mile)  orchestrates this moving masterpiece. With captivating performances all  around, the movie subjects you to the power of human spirit. To quote the  movie &quot;hope is a great thing,perhaps the best of things,and no good  thing ever dies.&quot; The Shawshank Redemption will not only restore your  faith in movies, but in humanity as well.
B00004TJTS|5.0|I like almost any movie I see. But when a movie touches you like this one it stands out. Although it's one of those dog and the boy movies It is my favorites. Beware though it is a tearjearker if you are a dog love and cry easy. and i did laugh.
6303942830|5.0|&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a stunning example of fine film-making. The cast, especially Eric Schweig, Russell Means and Daniel Day-Lewis, deserve incredible applause for bringing the characters of  Uncas, Chingachgook, and Hawkeye to life with grace and poise. Acting,  direction, score . . . all contribute to making this a wonderful film which  deserves to be a part of anyone's permanent collection.
B00004U8PA|5.0|If you have any qualms about seeing guys in drag, don't see this movie. If you don't like seeing people make out, don't see this movie! However, if you have a strong desire for strangness and don't mind gender-bending, go  out and have a good time at the Rocky Horror Picture Show. And even if you  do have problems with the afformentioned and you're just out for a little  bit of adventure and some major fun, see it. Although, a wise move would be  to see this movie in the privacy of your own home first, because there  might be some people at the midnight showings who'd simply scare you away.  (From what I've heard, anyway. I have yet to see it at midnight in the  theaters, but believe me, I'm going to.) It's a true rock-and-roll  extravaganza in which everyone can find something to enjoy! After this  movie, dammit (Janet), you'll never be the same!
B000002JS6|5.0|When AC/DC's original lead singer Bon Scott died after the band had reached it's peak with their other masterpiece Highway to Hell many people thought the band was over. Little did they know that the next year AC/DC  was going to release a tribute to their deceased singer that would become  one of the greatest album ever recorded. It also introduced new lead  &quot;screamer&quot; Brian Johnson.<br />The first song on Back in Black is  Hells Bells. It is in my opinion one of their greatest songs. It has kind  of an eerie feeling to it. The next song Shoot to Thrill is AC/DC just  rockin.' Angus kicks off the song with cool guitar riff (yea it's only 3  chords.) Thats another thing, I'm really sick and tired of people saying  how Angus only know 3 chords and that he's a bad guitar player. As a guitar  player myself I've always felt that it's not what you it's how you use what  you know, and that's not even the case with Angus. He's really an amazing  guitar player especially on the earlier AC/DC albums. Ok now that I've  addressed that...back to the music. The put it plain and simple this album  rocks. There are no power ballads or any rock cliche's. It's pure blues  rock. What You Do for the Money Honey, Given the Dog A Bone, Shake A Leg,  and Have A Drink On Me are amazing rocking songs. Two of AC/DC biggest  songs, Back in Black and You Shook Me All Night Long are also on this  album. These songs like the rest of the album are truly amazing. The  greatest part about all of this is that 20 years later the songs are still  in heavy rotation on many radio stations. For first time listeners this is  definately the album to get and as far as AC/DC fans if you don't have Back  in Black there's a problem. I also reccommend for first time listeners  Highway to Hell, Let There Be Rock, Stiff Upper Lip, High Voltage, Dirty  Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, and For Those About to Rock.

B00001NFCY|5.0|This CD really fills a niche that needed to be. The songs are original and talented and the themes are exactly the kind of things teenagers are looking for. A critic of their last CD said that &quot;making teenagers  depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel.&quot; First of all this is  hilariously true, second of all that is why Creed is so successful. People  who want to hear bouncy, fun songs buy Britney Spears or the numerous  boy-band clones. The rest of us who realize that these &quot;artists&quot;  are corperate puppets and shallow flash-bulb sensations look for artists  that connect directly to our lives. Creed does a remarkable job of just  this by providing deep, creative lyrics that express just the kind of  hopelessness that teenagers thrive in. They are by no means whining  pessimists, either, a lot of their songs are simply about Life and the  daily occurences. &quot;Higher&quot; for example is one of the best  interpertations of falling in love with someone that I've yet heard, and  &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; expresses the joy of having a child (which  I've yet to experience but none-the-less can appreciate). All and all this  group is one of the original bands out there that show us the music  industry is not completely dominated by shallow, mass-produced clones like  the Britney/Aguilera creature or N'SYNC/Backstreet Boys robots. I don't  care what anyone says those are the same people in different clothes.
B00004R99R|5.0|I have to admit that when I first saw Disney's &quot;Hercules&quot; I was definitely NOT IMPRESSED.  If I had written this review the evening after that first viewing I would probably have rated this movie at about 2 or  maybe 3 stars -- like many of the other reviews listed for this movie on  Amazon.com.  In the intervening three years, however, I've come to  thoroughly enjoy this animated feature.  Why?  Well, I'll tell you...<br />1)  The story line is good enough...not outstanding, but good enough.<br />2)  There's a really good bad guy (Hades) that you love to hate.  He's so evil,  self-centered, and conniving that you actually feel good detesting him.   He's a classic Disney villain...cut from the same kind of evil character  mold as 101 Dalmations' Cruella (animated and real-life).  <br />3) The  supporting characters &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Pain,&quot; which I  thought were only mildly annoying when I first watched the show, have  really grown on me.  They provide great comic relief.  These first three  points are enough to make this a 4-star movie, but the following point  moves this video to 5 stars for me...<br />4) The clincher for me is that the  music is awesome.  Again, it takes some listening to in order to catch the  vision of it.  It's got a strong traditional gospel strain mixed with  broadway chorus line pieces like songs from shows such as &quot;Little Shop  of Horrors,&quot; etc.  I especially like the song that Megura sings,  &quot;I won't say I'm in love.&quot;  <br />Sure there's a strong  sentimentality factor to the show, but that's not at all unusual for  animated Disney features.  When all is said and done I think that's a  plus!<br />If you look at my other reviews (e.g., Tarzan, Fox and the Hound)  you'll see that I do not believe that all Disney animated features are  5-star affairs.  Once you give this one a fair chance though, you may come  to enjoy it as much as I do.<br />Give this movie a second and third chance --  maybe after the children are in bed, and see if it grows on you too.<br />I  think it's worth 5 stars, and well worth the price!<br />Alan Holyoak
B000002UVX|5.0|If for no other reason, buy this CD for the gutsy screaming, wailing guitar licks laid down on machine gun.  Buddy Miles with his haunting vocal backup and Billy Cox laying down that thick bass riff.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love this CD! Savage Garden has quickly become one of my favorite bands  after listening to this album. These songs can make me dance, laugh, and  cry. All the emotion in Darren's voice is incredible and can put you in so  many different moods on each song. Anyone who loves music will appreciate  this emotion-filled CD.
B00003CWPR|2.0|Painful Kubrick movie. Has all the elements one comes to expect--which means, of course, that nothing you expect is in it. I'm a lukewarm Kubrick  fan, but I've never been disappointed by his movies until now. EWS is long,  boring, short on drama, long on uninteresting detail. The performances are  very good--from big star Cruise and Kidman to the secondary part  costume-store owner. But the best performances in the world can't save this  script. It's supposed to be menacing, paradoxical, and confusing; it's  supposed to intrigue and make you think. It tries too hard, however, and  the gratuitous nudity and quasisensual provokment by the plot make the  entire movie seem like as if the Farrelly Brothers got a hold of 2001.  Still, Kubrick fans will swear to their grave that It's A Beautiful Movie,  And Who Are You To Judge A Master? Take it from someone who's independent  of influence: Eyes Wide Shut is a rental at best, so long as about 12  people chip in apiece and you're playing cards instead of wasting your  valuable time watching it.
B000002U9Y|4.0|A good CD overall but there are some parts  that are terrible.  Corporal Clegg is a good song but is ruined by what I think is a kazoo.  It sounds like circus music!  Set the Controls...is a good song but I think it's too  slow and Jugband Blues just doesn't fit with the rest of the songs but I  can stand it.  Every other song on the CD is great and is one of their  better albums.  I rank it just below Meddle, DSOTM, and Wish You Were Here.    If you like Pink Floyd, this one is a necessity.

B000002UAU|5.0|Astoundingly, there was barely a decade between the release of the first American rock &amp; roll records and that of Sgt. Pepper.  One decade later saw the release of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; by the Sex Pistols.   It's amazing how far rock music came in its first twenty years, versus the  last 25.  If you like music of any kind, this record is for you.

0812932293|5.0|The book Loosing my virginity has aroused much enthusiasm. I read it from cover to cover  in  one breath. This is an excellence life story of man who make one's way in the world.

I wish him much success in his  efforts, because nothing succeeds like success.<br />PETRA
B00000JPH5|5.0|This is not only for Bowie/Connelly/Henson fans!  I saw this movie when I was 6 and it has been my favorite movie since!   It's about a teenage girl who wishes that goblins from a book would come and take her baby brother  away, and they do!  Buy this movie!
6301095294|5.0|This film is by all means an art film.There is less emphasis on things like plot and theme and more emphasis on production,camera shots,humor and of course the music videos.Some of the visual effects are awesome as  well.The best videos are Fool On The Hill,Flying,I Am The Walrus and Blue  Jay Way.This film looks like a bunch of great scenes pilled on to each  other and thats the down fall of MMT.The scenes pop up suddenly without an  explanation.This makes the film to short (55 min). I think if they had more  footage of John and George it would be better too.But its still a great  film in the art sense.<br />There are also 2 extra songs= They are orchestral  performances of She Loves You and All My Loving.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Dark Crystal is sooooooooooooooooooooooo good.  I rented over and over when I was little, and now I own it.  It is DEFINITELY worth the money.

0060977493|1.0|Arundhati Roy's book is an amatearish effort and that is its greatest strength and weakness. For me, though the entire fare remained disappointing.The reason-- weak story line and characters. In fact every  few pages a new character pops up and disappears. How it connects to the  tale is left to the readers imagination. The first page begins with a  similar description as in Alan Paton's &quot;Cry the beloved country.&quot;  After a rather evocative passage the story just flags off. And that remains  the problem with all the chapters. Rahel and Estha the two main characters  remain distant. Their father is shown to be a villain. It seems all these  characters are drawn from the writers own life. But then she does not  convey their lives well enough to the reader. So in the end you are left  with a vague jumble of words. Better editing could have made the story more  lucid. But I guess todays book sellers are concerned with marketing and not  good stories!  For an outsider there is some exotica in the form of  untouchables of India. For Indians this is all badly presented stuff !  but  then I could be an old fashioned reader who loves Vikram Seth, Doris  Lessing and Coetze. Give them to me any day....
0780626966|5.0|Fred Krueger, a name that brought fear to me as a child, and I'm sure to plenty of others. But I began to overcome my fears by watching the Nightmare on Elm Street movies 1 by 1. Then I began to constantly rerent  them. Why? Becuase they are the most interesting movies. Wes Craven,  creator of the series, made what you thought the safest thing to do, the  most harmful thing to do. Sleeping. Fred Krueger was a child murdered who  was burnt by the parents of the children he murdered a few years back. Now,  Nancy Thompson and her friends are having dreams of a man in a red &amp;  green sweater, and that has knives for fingegs. Nancy's friend began to die  mysterious deaths, and Nancy knows who's to blame, Fred Krueger. After  finding out about his past, Nancy turns to adults for help. Not even they  will believe her. So now it's up to her and only her to fight Freddy. That  was the first. The first that spawned 6 sequels. All of them record  breaking movies! Now, the sequels and the original are brought together in  a top-notch dvd collection, along with an extra DVD called the Nightmare  Encylopedia. The Nightmare Encyclopedia is every Nightmare On Elm Street  lover's paradise. With over hours of interviews with cast &amp; crews of  the movies, snippets from Freddy's MTV Special, behind-the-scenes footage,  theatrical trailers, music videos, and even 2 alternate endings! I don't  know how anyone will ever beat this DVD collection.

1559408855|5.0|Salo is a very difficult movie to critque. After watching it I felt like a giant hole had been ripped through me. I was upset and disturbed for weeks. I questioned mankind, our role in this world and my very existence. I hated  this film and I hated what it did to me. I refused to ever watch it again  or recommend it to anyone. But after a while, I realized that no other film  I had seen had made me react so strongly. I became curious about Pasolini  and his reasons behind making such a disturbing film.     Should Salo be  heralded as some kind of terrible masterpiece, or should it be panned for  being shocking, ugly and upsetting? Indeed, it is a terrible masterpiece.  One that I believe many people will never want to face.     When something  disturbs or upsets us, we must eventually ask why. Inquiry leads to  understanding and knowledge. Understanding and knowledge lead to peace and  happiness. So in a very bizarre way, Salo made me happy.
0783229011|5.0|This is the story of a survivor, the only little pig not to get taken to the butcher.  He was just a little pink pig, and what was his usefulness.  The family cat told him he was the bacon on the family table, the pork  chops in the freezer.  So little pink Babe had to prove his worth, and  thereby not become a meal on the family table.<br />He could talk to the sheep  and the sheep finally listened because they thought he was such a sweet  little thing.  He could round them up and tell them to do stuff and they  would do it because he was always polite when he asked.<br />At the county  fair, there was a sheep rounding contest.  All the other contestants had  dogs, but it was Babe the Pig who won.<br />I'm sure anyone who watches TV on  a regular basis has seen this sweet little movie.  If you have not seen it,  you are missing a great show.  I highly recommend the movie Babe.
0679746048|4.0|Author Susanna Kaysen lets the world into her mind in &quot;Girl, Interrupted.&quot;  For someone who was suppose to be &quot;nuts&quot; and in a mental hospital this tale of her time there is very clear and  brilliant.  She's wonderfully poetic and compelling.  I found this book  frank, honest and deeply funny in some areas.   She pulled no punches and  truly drove into her own mind and those who she shared her time with at the  hospital.  It's a tough and powerful novel that is told so honestly that  you want to be so careful with it and be respectful.   Kaysen is a talented  storyteller and very honest.  I really enjoyed this book.

0800132343|5.0|I say this movie is probably one of the best recent WWII submarine movies of recent times.  From my experiences of visiting a German U-boat (U-505) the set matches very well to what it actually looks like on the inside.   The cramped quarters for the crew was depicted very well.  One thing that  they remembered in this movie (comparing to the recent theater release of  U-571), the periscope is in the correct location and stays there.  It is in  the conning tower and not in the control room.  The intensity of the  attacks was written and acted out well as during the latter half of the war  when the Allies developed better anti-submarine weaponry and detection  devices, the U-boats were getting hit very hard.  The camera angles taken  in the ship made me feel as if I were actually there and even  I felt  the fear as the men did when they were under a depth charge attack.   After  the first few minutes of the movie I really didn't even notice the  subtitles anymore, partially due to the fact I took german in high school  as a class.  But other from my past experiences, dubbed movies have not  proved to me to show the emotion and feelings of the cast as they say their  lines. This movie is one of the best recent movies and maybe one of the  best overall WWII sub movies I've seen.
0380730405|4.0|The reason the book is called Rebecca is because, even if she was dead from the beginning of the story, Rebecca is the only interesting character in it. That is not to say the book is bad, not at all; it's charged with  suspense and mystery from the moment Mr De Winter brings home wife number  two, a simple young girl with the personality of a rabbit, who as soon as  she arrives to Manderley is intimidated by the memory of the incomparable  Rebecca, as present in her death as she was in life. Terrorized by a creepy  servant who idolized her former mistress, bit by bit the second Mrs De  Winter reconstructs the past of her new family and, of course Rebecca's. In  some parts the story becomes a little heavy, besides, I found the  atmosphere quite depressing, but I think that adds to the story, that sense  of dread that comes from feeling Rebecca's awesome presence all over the  lives of those involved with Manderley. It's a very, very good book, and  I'm anxious to see the movie Hithcock made based on it, only him could do  justice to this kind of story. A perfect choice to read in a stormy night.
0767802659|4.0|Even though it's basically a `B' movie trying to pass itself off as an `A', I thought this little romp through fascistic military disciplining and VERY gratuitous violence was another amazing milestone of controversial  filmmaking in the career of director Paul Verhoeven. It's undeniably THE  most ultraviolent film he's ever helmed, which in itself is no small feat.  His direction of `Robocop' started the string, and continued with `Total  Recall'. And even though the box office on this one proved rather  lackluster, it's definitely a return to grace for Verhoeven after his  directing work on `Showgirls'. Actually, just about any movie is a step up  from `Showgirls', but that's another story...<br />I also like (well, maybe  `like' isn't the proper word) how `Troopers' shows the true horrors of war,  and what really happens to the less-than-fortunate soldier in the middle of  the firefight. It's probably the first war flick since `Platoon' to do  this, but to a much greater degree, and to the point where it's  over-the-top, and darkly humorous, rather than grotesque and disturbing. A  very satirical take on the unpleasantness of war.<br />There's dismemberments,  disembowelments, guys getting blown up, torched, and lots of other  unpleasant stuff. Yes, it's couched in a sci-fi/action story (VERY loosely  based on the novel of the same name) with human soldiers going up against  giant insectoids, but I'd say it comes pretty close to the mark in  portraying realistic battle. I don't think there's a movie before or since  that's had this high a level of disturbing, graphic mayhem. It's probably  also one of Steven Spielberg's pieces of inspiration when he made `Saving  Private Ryan'.<br />One really sad thing about `Starship Troopers' is that  it's one of the most over-played movies on premium cable. It seems like  every other day I switch to a pay channel, there it is. I used to like this  movie quite a bit more in the past, but after my zillionth cable TV  viewing, it gets kinda stale. With it playing so often, getting the video  or DVD may not be so great an option...<br />`Late...
B000002MUW|5.0|I LOVE this album!  All of the songs are catchy.  Survival is a great opening, Secret is one of my favourites, when you listen to it you'll see why!  My favourites are.. Human Nature, Secret, Take a Bow and Bedtime  Story. Take A Bow is the best song on the whole album, and stays in your  mind all day long. Bedtime Stories is defiantely worth picking up!
0446525537|5.0|I read this book in one day.  It was one of the best that I have read in a long time.  I was surprised at how it was written, and the story line.  I was sweet and beautiful.  It is a definate MUST to read.  Anyone who reads  it will not have a dry eye, I cried from beginning to end.  Superb!
B000002MFN|4.0|There are only 2 Sex songs on this album, Erotica and Where Life Begins which both are worth skipping. Apart from that, the songs are great!  I Love Fever, Bye Bye Baby, Deeper and Deeper, Bad Girl, Waiting, Theif Of  Hearts, Words, Rain, Why's It So Hard, In This Life and Secret Garden! They  are BRILLIANT!  It is true that Madonna's singing AT TIMES can be a little  to be desired, but her songs have such a beat you can't help but dance and  buy more of her albums!   The best Song on this album is DEEPER AND  DEEPER!  I am forever playing it.  Just... GET UP AND DANCE!  You know you  want to!

B000002LLC|3.0|I like some of the Jazz on this album, like  More, Cry Baby and Sooner Or Later. My favourites on this album are Hanky Panky (makes me laugh every time), Back In Buisness and Something To Remember. The worst is I'm Going  Bananas!  It's awful!  But, the song that REALLY is Madonna is Vogue!  Now, you can't beat Vogue....  I think that you should buy this album if  you like Jazz, not Pop.

B00004TDRD|5.0|My wife and I watched this video again last night and it still works.  The screams still come even when you know what is coming and we cheered again at the ending.  And the final test, she couldn't sleep last night.  The  second video with the interviews, outtakes, etc. was interesting.  And  seeing the trailers again made us remember to check the water.  See it.
B00000J2SR|4.0|OK, this is not a Heavy Metal album. It is pop done by one of the best guitarrists of all time and a very talented singer. Most fans will throw this record out of their record collection because it is too soft. But if  you look through that, the guitarr playing is excellent and Joe Lynn Turner  has a great emotional voice. The songs are pretty strong too, even though  the production is too &quot;poppy&quot;.<br />I hesitate to give this album a  4, because it was a disappointment to me back in the days, and probably  will be to any fan of Rainbow, but it is too good for a 3. I rediscovered  this record some time ago, and if you just look through your expectations I  think you will find that it isn't really that bad after all.
0395754100|5.0|Every night, my 3-year old daughter has to have the first Curious George story read to her.  We've read all the other ones, but the first one is her favorite.  It's gotten to the point that I've memorized all the words --  which is exactly my point: I love each and every one of them.  Curious  George is still every bit as wonderful the hundredth time through!  A minor  warning: characters in the books, including Curious George, do smoke, which  does worry the father in me just a bit.  All in all, though, it doesn't get  much better than these classics.

0064431789|5.0|Reviewing Maurice Sendak's &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; is a bit like pointing at a full moon on a clear night: it's rather hard to miss.  My favorite book as a child first learning to read, &quot;Where the Wild  Things Are&quot; has recently moved into the handful of books my 3-year old  daughter wants read to her again and again (and again and again).  Max's  rebelliousness and imagination are like looking into a mirror for her: as  Max realizes what awaits him at home, I like to think she too remembers all  those times she misbehaved and got angry and then decided her parents were  okay after all.  The pictures still hold their charm after nearly four  decades; their quirkiness hasn't faded.  This book belongs in the library  of every human on the planet, regardless of age.
6304773382|3.0|Tank Girl (played convincingly by Lori Petty)is a fun grrrl action film.<br />Although the theme is supposed to be about human survival after a major geological/metorlogical nuclearish disaster, it pokes gender, and  class relations.<br />A handfull of rich white men control the world's water  supply with millitary force and apparently spend much of their leisure time  at a girle club where all of the women (unsuprisingly) are altered to look  alike) The women who ultimately engineer the saving idea are punkish  (anarcha-feminists? ) who defy society expectations of what is appropriate  for women.<br />Even though the graphic juxtapositions seem to be a cheap  imitation of the comic book/reality style pioneered so well in the 1960's  Batman TV series, and Ice T's inclusion in the cast, it is still a good  story line.<br />I've seen this movie several times, and even though she is  much less of a cultural compromise than Buffy (who also saves the world,  but looks more conventional)Tank Girl rocks. When the movie came out, I was  actually planning to streak my hair fushcia in homage to this great  character.<br />The soundtrack (produced by Courtney Love) is also worth  getting!
B00004S6GL|5.0|I'm 35 and have close to 500 CDs.  A local alternative radio station here in Columbus has been playing &quot;Son of Sam&quot;--the first time I heard it, I thought it sounded a little like a Matthew Sweet song, and I was  hooked immediately.  The DJ further mentioned that &quot;Figure 8&quot; was  an awesome CD, so I filed a mental note to myself to pick it up during my  next music shopping excursion.<br />I'm glad I did, because quite frankly,  this could be the best CD I've ever bought.<br />I really enjoy Elliott's  music.  I like the layered harmonies, the polished musicianship, and best  of all, the interesting, complex key changes (a quality I greatly  appreciate in songwriting).  There are 16 songs on this CD, 9 of which I  just CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO.  My personal favorites are &quot;Son of  Sam&quot;, &quot;Stupidity Tries&quot;, and &quot;Easy Way Out.&quot;<br />The  lyrics are a few levels above my comprehension level, but I don't care (I  avoided poetry in school at all costs).<br />I later picked up XO and  Either/Or as well.  While I enjoy these CDs, I don't like them as much as  Figure 8.  I wouldn't describe his latest effort as  &quot;overproduced&quot;, but it does feature many more musical instruments  (esp. piano) in his songs than his earlier CDs.  That said, I can  understand why some of his earlier fans don't appreciate the new CD as  much.<br />Definitely give it a try!
B00000JCB2|1.0|All the bad things about this album cannot be put into one review, but I'll try. Lets see, everyone says this cd rocks, but have they looked at it from a musical standpoint, obviously not. Nookie has the same 3 chords played over, and over, Break Stuff has the same 2 chords played over and  over. The lyrics never alter subject and are completely meaningless and  very childish and sound like Fred wrote them over his coffee break at his  old job. Theys guys have no talent and only got to the top by MTV promoting  them so much, they will probably be forgotten in a couple years. They say  they combine rap and metal, well you have the same  three guitar/ synthisizer notes played over and over with the same drum  part played over and over, and the &quot;singers&quot; whine about how  their homies died, or in the case of Fred Durst- his girlfriends running  away. Metal is my favorite thing ever, real metal has more meaningful  lyrics, more talent, and MUCH better musicianship. You want metal, get old  Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden with Bruce Dickinson, Megadeth, and Slayer.  Don't get this piece of NO TALENT, NO MEANING, UTTER MAINSTREAM  CRAP.<br />DOWN WITH THE TRENDS!
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is one of the most superb films ever made. Spielburg out did himself in this masterpiece.  This film held on to drama while still dispensing bone chilling fear. Dreyfus, Shaw and Schieder were at the top of their  form.  This movie is of the same quality of Close Encounters of the Third  Kind and Saving Private Ryan. The outtakes and trivia game are wonderful.      I recomend this film to you without reservation. This is a film you don't  want to miss!
B00000255F|5.0|Born To Run was the album that pushed Bruce Springsteen from a relatively unknown, to a superstar.<br />This album is considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and rightly so.  First, lets look at the sheer mastery  of this album before looking at the other points<br />Thunder Road:  From the  Harmonica and Piano at the beginning, this song is unique.  It has no  chorus, its jus a continual progression to a thunderous ending.  Its one of  Music's greatest recordings, without a doubt.  One listen to this song will  do it for you, guaranteed, but one listen won't be enough<br />Backstreets:  An agonizing, emotional trip that Springsteen leads us on that is certainly  memorable.  With the line &quot;Remember all the movies Terri(y) we'd go  see, trying to learn how to walk like the hero's, we thought we had to be.  When after all this time to find we're just like all the rest.  Stranded in  the dark(park) when forced to confess to........Hiding On The  Backstreets&quot;  This song will do things to you you never thought a song  could, the music is incredible, with a strong piano lead and guitar's  backing it up<br />Born To Run:  While not as great as the live version in the  box set, this version is still masterfully done.  You have to listen to it  with Headphones to catch the sheer brilliance of the production and  arrangement of the piece.  I could go on and on about this song, but it was  named one of the top 5 songs of the century, so that and one listen should  convince you.<br />Jungleland:  This song shows what a master Springsteen is.  From the opening with a violin solo, to a piano, to a roaring organ, to  blistering guitars, to a beautiful, 3 1/2 minute saxaphone solo, to a  thunderous ending, with the memorable line &quot;The streets on fire with a  real death waltz, between what's flesh and what's fantasy.  And man the  poets down here don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it  all be.&quot;  This song is the perfect closing, and, perhaps truly the  best song on the entire album.<br />These 4 songs alone are reason to get the  album.  The other 4, Tenth Avenue Freezeout, She's The One, Night and  Meeting Across The River, while in no means bad songs, just aren't in the  league with those other 4 ones.<br />The greatesting thing about this album  is the music, the best Springsteen ever did, in that he merged classical  music with Rock Music (really, the only time he ever did this as well) to  create a masterpiece.<br />The words and theme are of innocent dreams and  ideals.  While, I prefer Darkness On The Edge Of Town and its reality, this  album is still very valuable even with reality missing, as its about a  young man trying to find himself, and a young man's dreams.<br />And after  listening to this album, you'll feel that you've felt everything that young  man felt.and, perhaps truly the  best song on the entire album.<br />These 4 songs alone are reason to get the  album.

B0000399WI|5.0|There are few movies (or works of art, for that matter) that have moved me as this movie did.  The tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, takes place (for the most part)  inside the walls of Shawshank Prison, where he is serving his prison term.   From the beginning it is clear that Andy is different from the rest of the  inmates: he has an incredible inner strength and morality, and it starts to  win over a number of the other inmates, including Ellis &quot;Red&quot;  Redding (Morgan Freeman).  The journey to friendship that these men take is  simply a joy to watch... the two actors do a beautiful job portraying the  characters.  Moreover, the narration that Freeman does sets an incredible  job of setting tones and leading the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster.   In the end, the redemption that finally comes took me to a wonderful  place, and while it is strange to say that a prison movie can leave you  feeling like a million bucks, this one did.  I just can't say enough about  Robbins and Freeman; how there was no more mention of these two  performances at the Academy awards for that year is inconceivable to me.   I've seen others say that this movie is predictable... maybe it is, and I  just missed things.  All I know is that this is an incredible job of  movie-making: fine acting, directing that allows the movie to move at the  right pace and that doesn't overwhelm any other aspect of the movie, and a  story that makes the redemption very real.<br />I agree with other reviewers,  in that it would have been nice if the DVD had more features, but the movie  itself is, in my mind, one of the finest movies ever made.
B0000025D0|5.0|Unlike songs from Bruce's first 3 albums, this one combines reality with idealism and dreams.  The Boss has grown up a lot by the time he wrote this album.<br />Their are the heartrenching songs of &quot;Something In The  Night&quot; and the masterpiece of &quot;Racing In The Street&quot;<br />To go  along with the loud, angry rockers &quot;Adam Raised A Cain,&quot;  &quot;Candy's Room,&quot; &quot;Prove It All Night,&quot;  &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot;<br />Found  in this album are some of the greatest lyrics he ever wrote, so powerful in  their simplicity.  From Badlands: &quot;For the ones who had a notion, a  notion deep inside, that it ain't no sin to be glad your alive.&quot;  From  Darkness On The Edge Of Town &quot;Some folks are born into a good life,  others get their anyway, anyhow.  Well, I lost my money and I lost my wife,  those things don't seem to matter much to me now.&quot;<br />The first 5 times  through this album, I noticed Bruce didn't sound as emotional or as good as  he did on Born To Run, and thought of it in a negative context.  However,  after listening to it a few more times, I realized that this is how it was  meant to be.  Springsteen is angry, depressed and confused, all at the same  time.<br />This was when he chose to write about the real working class.  No  longer the free-spirited youth, but the young men who try to hold on to  some idealism in the face of tough times.<br />This is the boss at his best,  lyrically, but not musically.
080017948X|5.0|Phil Connors (played by Bill Murry) is an egotistical weather man from Pittsburgh PA, covering the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney. Phil becomes stuck in the same day, Groundhog Day, reliving it over and over  again. This incredibly humorous story is also touching and full of moral  values, as well as one of the best movies for character development to  date. <br />The main reason Phil begins his inner spring cleaning is because  of Rita (played by Andie McDowell), Phil's beautiful, down to earth  producer. Of coarse, by reliving the same day, Phil figures out the  qualities of Rita's ideal man, and through trial and error tries to  manipulate her into believing that Phil is him. However, Rita sees through  this shallow trick, even with Phil's best performance. After going through  many different fazes, like how many ways he can kill himself, Phil realizes  that his ticket to personal and romantic success is to make the best of  this very unique opportunity  and fix his faults. This chain of events  leads to a very humorous and romantic ending. <br />The path Phil takes toward  character development will make you laugh more than any other Bill Murry  film. If you love Bill Murry this movie is a sure thing, and a great film  to watch as a family as well. Overall, this is a wonderful film definitely  worthy of five stars.
B000002B30|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was a long time in coming, but it still didn't satisfy his fans.  Some will wonder why &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; and &quot;Rosalita&quot; aren't on the  album, but that's rather obvious to the average fan.<br />Missing, however,  are several top 10 songs.  But lets break the album down.<br />It has nothing  before Born To Run, which to some is inappropriate, but it makes  sense.<br />From The Born To Run Album it has Thunder Road and Born To Run.   Two of the greatest songs in Rock's history.  They did right here.<br />From  Darkness On The Edge of Town, only Badlands was selected.  Songs like Prove  It All Night and The Promised Land (not to mention the title track) which  are certainly on the level of Badlands, are missing, even though they're  essential.<br />From the River Album, both the title track and the Hungry  Heart (Bruce's first top 10 hit) are included.  Considering these are the  only 2 songs close to hits from the album, this makes sense.<br />From  Nebraska, only Atlantic City makes the cut, even though it wasn't even in  the top 20 on the charts, but Bruce wanted a song from each album.<br />Than,  the Born In The USA album confuses you.  Of the 7 Top 10 hits from that  album, only 4 are on this album.  Missing are the #6 hits &quot;I'm On  Fire&quot; and &quot;Cover Me&quot; as well as the #9 hit &quot;I'm Goin'  Down.&quot;  This kind of shows this isn't really a greatest hits album,  but a sampling of Springsteen's work.<br />War, a top 10 hit from his live box  set is missing, but its only a cover of another song, so its easy to see  why its missing.<br />From Tunnel Of Love, only Brilliant Disguise is  included, and not the title track, which was also a top 10 hit.<br />Finally,  Better Days and Human Touch were selected from his two '92 albums, and are  the 2 selections obviously most appropriate.<br />After that, you have Streets  Of Philadelphia, a recent Bruce top 10 hit.  This makes sense, but why  include Secret Garden, a song that didn't even top the 50th spot?  It makes  no sense.<br />Finally, you have 3 unreleased songs included, with the briefly  &quot;Re-united&quot; E-Street Band.  The First one, Murder Incorporated,  has been well known in underground/bootleg circles for years, and was  inexplicably not realeased before this point.  The second, Blood Brothers,  seemed to have been written for the occasion, with a tale of growing up,  and friendships splitting.  And the final, This Hard Land, goes along the  same lines.  Overall, these 3 will be enjoyed by any Bruce Fan, but by a  casual fan?<br />If your a fan of Bruce, get this CD just to get the last 5  tracks, which you can't get anywhere else.  But if your not, your better  getting an album of Bruce's rather than this, because the albums are  themed, this isn't.  This is more a sampling of his work, but not  necessarily his best.
0688152023|1.0|I purchased this book hoping to gain insight into techniques used by professional dancers.  Instead what i received is a book that has the first 15 or so pages dedicated to the NYC Ballet -INCLUDING individual  biographies, and then the exercises shown were basic stretches that anyone  would know if they ever attended HS physical education.  Granted, the  pictures are nice, the bio info is interesting, but not for $20.  If you  are beginner at fitness, great - go for it, but otherwise don't waste your  money.
B0000025T6|5.0|Maybe Darkness on the Edge of town matches this album, maybe.<br />Don't buy this album expecting to hear rollicking good fun anthems you'll be singing along with your buddies to at a party.<br />Springsteen, who recorded this  album without the E-street band (some say originally in his bedroom or  basement, depending on who you believe) has an edge he doesn't have in his  other recordings, its a crude, raw feeling to it.<br />Springsteen examines  all kinds of men, the men who kill (Serial Killer in title track, Johnny  99), the men who are unsure of themselves (State Trooper, Open All Night)  and those who are poor, but filled with pride (Mansion On The Hill, Used  Cars)<br />Reason To Believe is the perfect closing for this album, as it  offers a message of hope, but, offers it with skepticism, rather than  trying to be a type of 'message song.'  I compare it to Dylan's  &quot;Blowin In The Wind&quot; which basically means &quot;I don't know  what the answer is.&quot;<br />The highlights of this album are probably  Atlantic City, the story of a desparate man who has his back to the wall,  Highway Patrolman, the story of blood being thicker than water, and loyalty  to one's family over loyalty to one's job, and My Father's House, a story  of a son and a father's parting of ways.<br />The album is haunting, but in  it, you'll find some insight on the human psyche that psychologists don't  realize.<br />The music on this album won't impress you, the recording  equipment is similiar to what I have in my basement, and it shows.  But you  have raw genius, and in it, perhaps the best work Springsteen ever  produced.
0440234743|4.0|I have to admit that the Firm kept me up through a fast, uninterrupted reading.  With the Testament, however, there were times when I had to wonder where he was going with the story, especially during his boat trip  in Brazil.  In fact the book felt like two different books, one set in  Washington D.C. with a bunch of unethical lawyers and their money-hungry  clients, and the other set in the languid Brazilian river with the main  character attempting to overcome his alchol addiction.  His tendency to  summarize and condense scenes made me wonder if he was in fact writing a  treatment for a screenplay.<br />I kept hoping for a big showdown with the  &quot;good&quot; lawyers and the &quot;bad lawyers&quot; but that never  happened, as though Grisham decided to fast-track the &quot;thriller&quot;  aspect (this was the anticlimatic part for me) and opt instead to portray  one man's struggle with the meaning of life.  And interestingly enough,  before I knew what was happending, Grisham did manage to utimately make me  care for the protagonist Nate O'Reily.  So when the true climax came in his  second trip to the Brizilian river, I was touched by the unexpected events  surrounding Rachel Lane, who become the catalyst in transforming Nate's  character.<br />If non-stop, heart-pounding thriller is what you're looking  for, which I was, this isn't the book.  But by the last page, I didn't feel  betrayed by the author at all; I gained new respect for him for his valiant  attempt (and succeeding) at delving deeper into character transformation.   It's worth reading despite its flaws.
B0000025KI|4.0|A lot of fans consider this album to be one of Bruce's best, I don't.  But, I still view it as an essential album to anyone interested in Bruce.<br />First of all, this album is over 90 minutes long, and to get  anything out of the album, and to really understand it, you must listen to  the entire thing all the way through.<br />The title track is among Bruce's  best work.  Songs like &quot;The Price You Pay,&quot; &quot;Wreck On The  Highway&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot; and even &quot;Drive All  Night&quot; are haunting, yet beautiful.  Out In The Street and Cadillac  Ranch are the only Rock you'll find in this album, as the guitar is  noticable absent from the entire album.<br />While what Bruce is writing about  is important, in that its a boy becoming a man, this album lacks one thing,  Good Music.  With the exception of the title track, most of the vocal work  is horrendous (compare Independence Day with the Live Track from The Boxed  Set) compared to other work, and unlike Nebraska, it doesnt have that  &quot;raw&quot; feel to it.<br />Plus, there are way too many useless songs,  such as &quot;Jackson Cage&quot;, &quot;Crush On You,&quot; &quot;Sherry  Darling,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot; and &quot;I'm A Rocker.&quot;   perhaps the greatest example of a bad song is the top 10 hit &quot;Hungry  Heart&quot; which epitimizes bad music.<br />This album should have been made,  not a double album, but a single album, containing the songs &quot;The Ties  That Bind,&quot; &quot;Independence Day,&quot; &quot;Out In The  Street,&quot; &quot;The River,&quot; &quot;Point Blank,&quot; &quot;The  Price You Pay,&quot; &quot;Drive All Night,&quot; and &quot;Wreck On The  Highway&quot; if these were the only tracks, it would be perhaps Brue's  best work, as words can't describe &quot;Point Blank.&quot;  But, all that  other stuff is basically Filler, and cheap attempts at pop stardom.<br />So if  your not a big fan of Bruce, skip this album, its still essential for the  tracks I mentioned, but you could do better.
0783225482|5.0|Directed by the amazing Robert Zemeckis, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; features a clever script, an awesome cast, and mind-blowing special effects that most Hollywood films lack nowadays. The film centers on the eternal  quest for beauty and youth by an aging Hollywood starlet, Madeline Ashton,  (played by the brillant Meryl Streep). Her high school rival, Helen,  (Goldie Hawn), brings her latest beau to meet Ashton after a campy  performance in a musical based on &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (get the  theme already?).<br />When Madeline runs off with Helen's fiance (Bruce  Willis) Helen falls into a demented state and becomes obese and determined  to get even with Madeline. After discovering a secret potion sold by a  Hollywood witch (Isabella Rosellini) both Helen, and later Madeline regain  their youth, vitality, and beauty. However, all this comes with strings  involving immortality.<br />The wonderful script pokes fun at many  stereotypes, rumors, and realities Hollywood is well-known for. From  plastic surgery to the fact that no one has never met a neighbor in Los  Angeles, the script is intelligent scriptwriting at its' best. The special  effects by Industrial Light and Magic which has Helen walking with a hole  through her midsection, and Madeline walking with a twisted neck are  incredible to watch. One thing I adored about this film was the wicked,  dark, and diabolical score by Alan Silvestri that incorporates harps and  vengeful theme throughout the film.<br />The film's ending featuring a legion  of Hollywood's undead (including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, and James Dean)is  hysterical and even the names of the two main characters, Madeline  (&quot;Mad&quot; as in crazy) and Helen (&quot;Hell&quot; as in hellish) is  genius. Personally along with &quot;She-Devil,&quot; &quot;Heathers,&quot;  and &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,&quot; this film  ranks as one of the best black comedies to come out in recent years. A  must-see for everyone!
B000001A9P|5.0|This is a great CD. Hard to add much more to what other folks have said about the content but I just wanted to mention that this CD has the best use I've ever heard of Dolby Pro-Logic Surround in a live setting.<br />The  odd thing is that nowhere on the CD or liner notes does it state the CD is  mixed in surround sound, but it clearly is.
B000002JB8|5.0|Owning almost everything Vangelis has produced, I would like to say that Oceanic is one of his best!
6305426651|5.0|I loved Life is Beautiful.  The actor(esses) were great; the storyline was great.  It's a unique tale about an Italian-Jewish man and his family.  When the man(Roberto) and his son are sent to a concentration camp during  the WWII, his heartbroken wife sacrifices her freedom and pleads to German  officials to let her be sent to con. camps too.  LIfe is Beautiful superbly  crafts this family's story before and after their exile.  I saw this movie  in both Italian and English versions, and I laughed and cried in both.   It's a  remarkable movie with Oscar-caliber actors.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I am in a very high stress profession.  I've found this CD to be so relaxing and rejuvinating after a difficult day.  The melodies are lovely and evocative of the title.  I almost feel that I can slip away to my own  secret garden while listening.  Also makes excellent background music for a  romantic dinner.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I just went and got this CD tonight, actually I am listening to it right now.  It is soooo good! If you liked the first single, &quot;There You Go&quot;, you will love the whole CD. The lyrics are awesome.  It sounds as  if she is speaking from personal experience. Some of the songs sound alike  until you actually listen to the words, but in my opinion, it is an  EXCELLENT CD!
6302415993|5.0|Not trying to sound too ponderous, but &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; is an important document from a pivotal period in American (and international) social history.  A pair of bookends, this video and the one from Woodstock  (both festivals held the same year).  The music is absolutely up to snuff  (as you'd expect from the Stones, Jefferson Airplane, Ike and Tina Turner,  the Flying Burrito Brothers).  Yet of equal power, impact, and importance  are the crowd shots.  You go to Altamont with this one and see just how  screwed up things got.  And perhaps even come away with some sense of the  &quot;why&quot; of it.  Five big stars as a rating for this one.
9681501225|5.0|wow. Being a prolific reader, I thought I could finish this small (relatively) book in under two hours. Well, more than six years have passed since I first read it, and my thoughts keep coming back to Sidhartha and  how he found his way to himself - a man's true profession.  This book will  require you to search within for an understanding of yourself. This was the  fist book of Herman Hesse that i read and since then I have read  Steppenwof, demian, and Narcissus and Goldmund. All great books that force  you to seach for meanings within your life through the experiences of the  characters in the book. But Sidhartha is the best of the lot. The journey  by Sidhartha from his place to the river where he discovers himself is  worth reading.
B000023VR6|5.0|Man, this album is by far the best rap album since N.W.A.'s &quot;Straight outta Compton.&quot; it has 22 tracks, plus a hilarious outro. i love dre's style! best songs are #11, #10, #3, #4, #12, #13, #15, #17, and #19. (#18  is pretty funny, too!) buy this album and keep it real, brotha!
0140188711|5.0|Cohen's stream of consciousness - beautiful- style leaves us no escape from this absolute, uncompromising love. I have read the book many times, and it never fails to overwhelm me...although I should add that I have never been able to read the last 20 pages... Ariane and Solal are the most beautiful lovers since forever, unconcerned by others - it is the history of love from start to, ufortunately, the end..<br />(By the way, the novel does not take place in France, but Switzerland)
6305807086|5.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is an amazing story of sexuality, love, betrayal, and the one thing that many people say to themselves... &quot;i wanna be someone else&quot;. I thought this film was well written out because all these different emotions got tangled up in the 4 lives of  Maxine, Craig, Lotte and John,  creating an amazing story starting off with  the 7 and half floor and little door that lead into a big change in not  just Craigs life, but many others. Be sure to listen to everything said  'cause jokes a easily missed and you might not understand the situation at  the very end of the film. It would be a big mistake to miss this film as it  makes you think a lot about yourself.  And if your into creative writing it  wouuld be perfect as it gives you many of YOUR OWN ideas.
0684800713|3.0|One of the most striking features of this novel is the bland superficiality of the characters.  I found that I did not particularly like any of them, and that dampened my appreciation of the story.<br />The book  is about a sort of competition for the lady Brett Ashley.  She enjoys using  men as her playtoys and delights in their chase after her.  The persona  from whose point of view the story is told is Jake Barnes.  The rest of the  characters are unremarkable and are mostly only memorable for their  blandness.<br />We go from France to the bullfighting performances in Spain  &amp; there are fascinating allusions to the matador / bull relationship  being akin to courtship and sexual intercourse between a man and woman.  Images of impotence and castration abound and are made all the more  significant as Jake can no longer sexually &quot;perform&quot; due to a  wartime injury.<br />This book is certainly not for everyone.  I am glad I  read it &amp; would recommend it as an important 20th century literary work  (even though I did not especially enjoy it myself).  It is not so different  from the apathetic landscape of T.S. Eliot's poem &quot;The  Wasteland&quot;;  a world in which it is thought that feeling nothing at  all is preferable to feeling pain.  But nothing could be more horrifying  than a notion such as that....
0064471047|3.0|this book was ok. i didn't really act like it was the best book. It's great for little kids.

630505116X|4.0|this movie was great in my opinion. it had good special effects average acting about the right lenght, good storyline. the only problem i have with this movie is the end. they just get done with destroying the alligators  and then at the end there on a island with some other monster. but still is  a watchable movie. i would just rent however.
6304576935|4.0|Of the three films featuring The Next Generation crew,ST:FC is the best yet,even ranking among The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country.Unlike the other TNG films,this is not a two hour big  budget TV episode,but a real movie that's fast paced,action packed and has  agree of warmth and humor.Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as  Capt.Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to  sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence agaist the Borg is captivating  as well as terrifying.And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent  Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.A great battle  scene with the borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes  alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the  Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two  different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all  too convienient TV ending.Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to  be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike
6300214753|5.0|well let me start out by saying if you dont like this movie your crazy. this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.actually i had avoided it on comedy central for some odd ball reason but i didnt know what  i was missing.  the acting is great and the movie overall is halarious. the  cast was just right. and the parade scene was the best scene in the movie  trust me this is one you'll wanna bye and watch over and over and over ive  seen it about 30 times or more.bye the thing its awesome.
158234082X|5.0|This book is a hoot!  I read it two weeks ago and I am still laughing.  Adam the breadmaker and &quot;What do you know about me?&quot; are hilarious sections of the book.  I love to cook for my family--it is  therapy for me after a long day at work.  Now if my kids tell me I should  open a restaurant, I definately will say &quot;NO!&quot;  Bourdain has a  great sense of humor.  Don't miss this book. P.S. I see Tom Hanks as  Bourdain in the movie.
6305537798|3.0|well the first time i saw it i was tricked into it.i hated it the first time i saw it. however the second time i saw it i found it to be not all that bad.  the acting is so so basically just a bunch of seventeen magazine  people are in it.  i wouldnt buy it its only rentable quality.
B00003CXB6|1.0|I watched this film with high hopes and they were dashed.This is a very silly film.How silly?Well,the &quot;heroes&quot; of the film are directly responsible for everyone's deaths.Firstly,they kidnap a baby dinasour to  put a cast on its leg(were they planning to return to take it off in two  months?).This causes their friend to get eaten when the mother comes  looking for it.Our dear &quot;heroes&quot; then sabotage the camp,which  causes the deaths of many members of the camp.And it doesn't matter how  many people get attacked and eaten,nobody fires one single shot at the  beasts.Are they supposed to be bullet-proof? In fact,people keep putting  their rifles down and walking far away from them. Despite raptors being  near by,the camp members decide to walk through long grass,making them  sitting ducks.Even when a T-Rex rampages through the gun capitol of  America,not one single shot is fired.This is a very over-rated film.It  is,to put it bluntly,stupid.
0800141326|3.0|well this movie would have been better if they had made it interesting at the beginning.  however it still delivers the goods. it almost looks like your watching jurrasic park for the last 45 miniutes of the movie.  And a  unclear ending, well actually it was very clear but it left it open to a  sequel.  it has some pretty good special effects. but quite frankely the  soundtrack is much better.  it has the wallflowers,puff daddy/jimmy page  just to name a few. only buy it if your a hardcore godzilla fan.

B00000D9TQ|5.0|PHIL COLLINS HITS (THIS CD IS GREAT).
B000006045|5.0|What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it.<br />As usual with Massive  releases, &quot;Mezzanine&quot; features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  &quot;Teardrop&quot; is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky &quot;Dissolved Girl,&quot;  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica.<br />Horace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial &quot;Angel,&quot; and the almost-retro  Massive Attack &quot;Man Next Door&quot; and &quot;(Exchange)&quot;.<br />The  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on &quot;Risingson&quot; do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs.<br />Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.

B00001P4RI|3.0|Dead Can Dance broke up, and after their supernal career I was hoping for so much from a solo album by Brendan, especially considering that he took 7 years to finish it. But what was released is but a meagre collection of  songs that, although it pains me to say it, is *boring*. Brendan could have  done so much more! But, I can say one good thing about this album:  &quot;Voyage of Bran&quot; is an excellent song. This song describes the  very core of Brendan's philosophical belief and *searching*, which was such  a wonderful part of his songs in Dead Can Dance. In fact, this song is so  good that I would recommend the entire album just for this song.
B000002GWJ|5.0|Yes, the cover looks like a cheesy piece of 70's garbage. The CD isn't. Tom Waits is a unique and creative poet. The boldness of his voice his amazing. The mixture of it's melodrama and exaggerated rasp is miraculous,  then add an eerie lisp. That's right it's strange as anything.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I first got Hole's &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; when it first came out, when I wasnt a very big Hole fan. I didnt really appreciate at first. Then I bought &quot;Live Through This&quot;, and loved it. I decided I'd listen to  &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; and I was astonished how amazing the album  really is. To transform from &quot;Live Through This&quot; to  &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; isnt really easy, and Courtney Love pulls its  off perfectly. Highlights on the album are, &quot;Northern Star&quot;,  &quot;Hit So Hard&quot;, &quot;Malibu&quot;, and &quot;Boys on the  Radio&quot;. Its a great album, pick it up next time you get a chance,  definatly worth your money!
B000001GQJ|5.0|This disc is the testimony of the true genius of Martha Argerich. She uses her more than perfect technique to bring to life whatever she plays. Truly, her playing is of the utmost virtuosity, but never for the sake of the  viruosity. Instead she creates colours and atmospheres in such pieces as  Ravel's Yeux d'eau or Prokofieff's Toccata which have to be heard to be  believed. What an incredible achievement of a girl who wasn't even 20 years  old ! Her 1972 recording of the Liszt Sonata completes this marvellous  disc. Her fiery temperament, her brilliant fingerwork and her perfectly  timed lyrical playing makes this performance take your breath away from the  first till the last note. This disc offers a selection of pieces in which  Argerich is simply at her best. Buy it !
B00004THAY|1.0|Instead of conjuring the true spirit of the blues that they have both harnessed for most of their careers, Clapton and King have triumphantly succeeded in making an album more representative of the aesthetic of Leo  Sayer than Muddy Waters. &quot;Riding With the King&quot; has real  problems, namely mediocre sidemen (e.g., Andy Fairweather Low) and poor,  sentimental songwriting  from Doyle Bramhall. There are two sad things  about this album: 1. &quot;Riding with the King&quot; could have been  great, because it is conceptually promising; 2. That Clapton and King  released this mediocre album shows that both musicians have poor taste as  they reach the end of their careers (and I say this most with respect to  Clapton, not King).
B00004SCX6|1.0|Kill me now, this famous Britney Spears decided to re-make a classic. Yes, her sad destruction of Satisfation was horrible. She added another minute to the song with all of her UHS and YEAHS. Her upbeat drums and guitars in  the background were superb, especially to cover up her rough vocals. In  short by listening to this album, I come to the conclusion that B.Spears,  is just a Karaoke Singer who got lucky.
B00004TBWR|5.0|CCR's fourth album &quot;Willy And The Poor Boys&quot;, and perhaps their most commercially accessible, pushed the group into the rock and roll stratosphere reserved for likes of the Beatles, Hendrix, and Joplin. This  was the group's third platinum album. Success seemed as though it came  naturally for the group. John Fogerty's down to earth from-the-street vocal  style endeared him to a large cross section of fans. Sounding as if they  were from deep in the Louisiana Bayou rather than El Cerrito, California,  they had plenty of rhythm and blues in there soul. They successfully  combined those blues and r &amp; b influences with rock music to come up  with an irresistible sound that literally possessed your feet.<br />With  Fogerty belting out anthems like &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, CCR won the  hearts of Vietnam Veterans and protesters of war all across the star  spangled land. The classic blues song &quot;Cotton Fields&quot;, lets  people know just how important blues music was to the group, as well as  indicating where the heart and soul of their music emerged from. &quot;The  Midnight Special&quot; was a chart stopper, and easily one of the most well  known songs by the group to this day. &quot;Down On The Corner&quot;, with  it's funky and irresistible bass lines to start things off, really draws  you right in and holds you mesmerized throughout the entire song. Besides  being a wonderful foot stompin' boogie (and now classic song), it has  become an enduring rock staple for the ages. Songs of this nature tend to  easily hold their unwavering appeal without the ravaging effects of time  changing anyone's opinion. &quot;Effigy&quot; is my personal favorite, it  ends the album leaving you with a feeling of wanting and emptiness inside.  The only thing that could possibly fill the void is more of the same music  blaring out of your speakers.<br />Creedence Clearwater Revival held music  lovers everywhere in the palm of their hands. While ruling the Top 40  airwaves and satisfying the anti-establishment in one powerful stroke,  America embraced CCR. After all, they seemed to need each other.<br />The  analog 20 bit K2 coding process renders a sparkling effect to this timeless  music. No doubt, one of the most popular and successful remastering  processes today. The eight albums chosen from the CCR catalog are given  their due by the first class re-release program headed up by Fantasy.<br />Always impeccably tasteful, Fantasy never pulls any punches and never  sacrifices a thing when it comes to quality. This series is a must addition  for any CCR fan, or any serious rock and roll fan for that matter. Stay  tuned for the next installment. This writer felt that starting off with the  most important album of their career was most appropriate.<br />Keith  Hannaleck  July 10, 2000  MuzikMan's Sound Scriptaves and satisfying the anti-establishment in one powerful stroke,  America embraced CCR.

B00003CXAE|5.0|I was just a teenager when I first saw this movie, I remember lining up for hours just to get a ticket. Now that I have a copy of my own, I get to re-live the energy that I felt all those years ago. This would have to be  one of the great big screen musicals of all time.  One of those movies that  you can watch over and over and still love it as if you were seeing it for  the first time. Life is not complete without a copy of this video, can't  wait for the DVD version.
B00004TL21|4.0|I have to say the first two Deftones CD's were better. But this is still good. They should have picked Elite to be their first single. My favorite songs are Digital Bath, ELite, and Change. I recommend you get this cd.
0321012542|5.0|My pick for the best of the Collected Works, edging out the Riverside, and much better than the Oxford and Arden. (Although the Arden individual plays are essential.) Bevington's book has everything you'll need: concise, but informative introductions, emendation notes, and most importantly very good glosserial notes. The pages are not tissue-thin (good for taking notes in pencil, but not really for highlighting) and the type is a good size for my 37 year old eyes.<br />As for Shakespeare's works themselves, too many people don't know where to go after reading the biggies. Check out Cymbeline, Measure For Measure and Troilus and Cressida if you're looking for some vastly underrated plays that aren't performed nearly enough.

B0000025RQ|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance is pure driving pleasure, the ultimate CD to crank up on a long drive by yourself.  It rocks from start to finish, with only minor glitches, standing up as one of Priest's best.  <br />1. The  Hellion/Electric Eye--punchy from the start, then builds up to the right  momentum.  Here Halford sings in the mid-range but with power.  Excellent  solo.<br />2. Riding on the Wind--pseudo speed-metal.  One of Halford's finest  vocal performances, if only for the very long sustained note at the end  which plays with the melody before coming to a crashing end.  Try to play  it without wanting to hit the repeat button!<br />3. Bloodstone--a catchy tune  with an Eddie Van Halen-like intro.  A fine way to be commercial and heavy  at the same time.<br />4. (Take These) Chains--a commercial-sounding tune, not  the strongest, but still good fun.<br />5. Pain and Pleasure--my least  favorite tune, since it seems stuck in an uncertain mid-tempo.  It sounds  like a slightly heavier outtake from the previous album, Point of Entry (a  four-star, not five-star album).  <br />6. Screaming For Vengeance--a highly  intense workout for every band member.  It's almost like a remake of Deep  Purple's Burn, on uppers...with borderline thrash sensibilities.  Knowing  that Priest could be this way makes Painkiller (1990) less of a shock.<br />7.  You've Got Another Thing Coming--perhaps somewhat overplayed on radio, but  still a catchy tune with hooky guitars and an in-the-pocket solo.  <br />8.  Fever--here Halford sounds like Robert Plant in the beginning.  An  excellent track, somewhat similar to (Take These) Chains in places, but  better.  Towards the end, after the solo and buildup, the vocal line turns  it almost into another song altogether--an even better song!--before the  chorus comes back and drives it home.<br />9. Devil's Child--Here AC/DC is the  point of reference.  Intense vocals and a study in power chord  perfection.<br />No metal collection can consider itself complete without the  Priest, and Screaming For Vengeance is the place to start.  Fans of their  early (progressive) period, NWOBHM period, commercial period, or latter-day  thrash period can all at least agree on this one.
B000001GK9|2.0|I never quite understood the classical world's blind reverence of Herbert von Karajan.  Although I appreciate his early recordings and consider him to be one of the best operatic interpreters ever, his Mahler, like much of  his later recordings, are arrogantly bland and superficial.  I use the word  arrogantly, because he seems to feel that he can get away with this for the  the sole reason that he's Herbert von Karajan.<br />This work embodies the  greatest virtues of humanity - wisdom, humility, and most of all an  equanimous acceptance of impermanence.  These qualities are further  amplified by the darker and more grotesque moments of the symphony, that  are ultimately squashed by these virtues.<br />In my opinion, it takes an  interpreter who wholly embodies these virtues to pull off a convincing  rendition of this work.  HVK's arrogance has absolutely no place here.  It  is the Abbados, Horensteins, Walters, and the Klemperers who truly  understand the nature of Mahler's Ninth.  The recordings with Klemperer  and Horenstein are uniquely poignant.  They both led lives as tragic as  Mahler's yet they came to the same conclusions that Mahler did close to his  death when he wrote this piece.<br />Every time I hear someone praise this  recording I cannot help but wonder, &quot;Have I gone nuts?&quot;  Then, I  heard Claudio Abbado conduct the same work with the same orchestra that  casted away my doubts.  Look elsewhere for a definitive recording.

B00000J7J4|2.0|After many years of making some great music, but never getting recognition from anyone but his loyal fans (I guess that wasn't enough), Carlos Santana sells out with this album that is full of alternative singers from other  bands.  Although Santana still has some magic in his guitar, it seems as if  he only cared about the fame and money in this poor excuse for a cd.  This  should be filed under s, not for Santana but for Sellout.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This movie was fantastic!  Wouldn't it really be a great TV series?<br />I do have a question that keeps gnawing at me;  at the end of the movie when all of the GQ crew are exiting the ship, I noticed that the alien girl (don't  recall name) stumbled and looked to me like she broke her ankle just before  the camera cut away.  Did anyone else notice this?  It's just one of those  little things that drives you nuts until you find out!<br />If you saw it  and/or know what happened please e-mail me at tmaguire@z.com!
B00004S361|5.0|This is a fantastic album. It has never gained the reputation of \\"Talking Book\\" or \\"Innervisions\\" but I don't think there is a good reason why. Maybe it's just that it followed the awesome \\"Innervisions\\" and was not radically  different. Also, I suppose, the appearance of some \\"attitude\\", especially  in the obligatory funky side two opener \\"You Haven't Done Nothin' \\" (sic),  which apparently was aimed at Richard Nixon, may not have made it as  appealing commercially.<br /> Stevie said that this album, which followed his  usual format, was meant to be the end of that phase of his career (a  serious car accident nearly gave it another meaning!). You can see the  \\"higher planes\\" awaiting him on the sleeve which is beautifully reproduced  in the digipak version I bought. <br />He really is disarming - who else could  get away with daggy titles like \\"Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\\" and  \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\"? (In fact, the same goes for the album title. I  assume the fact that it was already such a mouthful caused them to take  some license and leave out the final `s' in \\"Fulfillingness's\\".) Wonder  gets away with it because the material is brilliant! There is not a weak  track on this fantastic record. Do you really need any incentive to buy  it?<br />Due mainly to the deterioration of the vinyl, I hadn't played this or  the other Wonders I own for ages. Even though these new CD's apparently are  not remastered from the original tapes (Wonder owns them - anyone know what  happened?), the sound is excellent. It's a winner!

B000006PDZ|5.0|This silent film from 1921 has got such an eerie and ominous feel to it that it's almost physical.  Slowly crawling into the viewers minds are the haunting images of acid-trippy set design, the furtive, meaningful glances  of Dr. Caligari, and many, many dark things implied.  Much of the story is  pushed along not through the visual spectrum but by what the viewer is  forced to conjure as happening.  When the screen proclaims there have been  murders, the viewer sees them in bright, bloody detail.  They hear the  screams, feel the stabs, and know the maddness of the killer.  Keep in mind  this is a silent film!  The bizarre set design, flawless performances, and  the final scene with its seriously twisted ending make this essential  viewing for any film connosieur, especially those of you that stray toward  the genre of horror.  Come and take a look inside The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari!
B00004U45G|5.0|folks, this is as good as it gets. i've been a zep fan since the beginning. zep's bbc live recordings were the best shot at getting the vibe of the greatest of all acts. that was recorded some 30 yrs ago. now with  jimmy page working with the crows we're got a fuller, richer sound that  captures the essence of the best rock and roll band ever. my hat goes off  to chris robinson, he did his homework! steve gorman you did right by the  greatest drummer of all time, john bonman. i've had tears in my eyes for  the last three days while listening to Live at the Greek. thanks
B00000J7J4|5.0|I have played this CD almost constantly since it arrived. Talking about it with others we all have the same opinion.....WOW! I have liked Santana for years but this is the first collection I have purchased. While one or two  tracks may drag a bit,    the rest of the songs are Santana at his best.  This is very visual music just close your eyes and listen... better yet get  up and dance!
B000000XB9|5.0|For a band from San Francisco, Creedence Clearwater Revival did more to capture the feeling of southern swamp grass than any rock group.  John Fogerty's songwriting and playing key this CCR Compendium which is pretty  much mostly his work anyway.  If you like CCR, this is a must buy.

They all wonder why they were brought  here.  They soon forget their worries and begin to enjoy their vacation.  But then all of a sudden they start to get murdered one by one.  The people  realize there is no one else on the island except for them.  That means the  murderer has to be one of them!  But who?  This question sticks in the  reader's mind from when the first person gets killed all to the last  chapter.  I couldn't guess who the killer was until the very end.  There is  so much suspense in this book!  If you need to do a report or love  mysteries, but this book!

B00000J7RZ|3.0|First of all her voice is not that great. Her voice on a scale of 1 through 5 is a two. Her voice is not as bad as Enrique Inglesias, but not nearly as good as Shakira. Her music is not great dance music. If you want  good beats get Fey. Want a good voice get Shakira. Want good Spanish music  get Olga Tanon. If you want music to relax to get Jennifer Lopez.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden proves once again how talented they are. While the music world is filled with boy bands, pop princessess, and hip hop headbangers, the guys manage to come up with an album with beautifully written lyrics  and music. The album is melancholy, but so is life. Savage Garden deserves  a great amount of respect because they write their own music too.
0800139151|4.0|This movie is very entertaining and I loved the photography tricks.  Stone, Hackman and Russell Crowe give good performances.  Dicaprio is entertaining as well as suited for this part.  I enjoyed it!  One of the  best westerns made in this era that I've seen.
0425170349|5.0|Of the Clancy books I've read, I thought this one was best.  The action is superb, the plot is involving, and there is good character development - especially when one considers the sheer quantity of characters that are  followed in this book.

B000006NPY|4.0|\\"Adore\\" opens with a soft sound that sounds a little like crickets chirping quietly. Soon after, the gentlest guitar pluckings you can imagine chime in, and Billy Corgan, whose voice sounds crystal clear, as if he's in the same room you're in, begins to sing. \\"You make me real,\\" he croons with true emotion, setting the tone for the rest of \\"Adore\\" and the Smashing Pumpkins' temporary change in style. \\"To Sheila\\" is a sparse song where the instruments seem to arrive from far away. From the beginning, it's obvious this is a far cry from previous Pumpkins fare.<br /><br />\\"Ava Adore\\" is more like vintage Pumpkins material, a melodic tune with Corganesque lyrics like, \\"Lovely girl, you're the murder in my world.\\" \\"Perfect\\" is another gorgeous pop song, sort of in the vain of \\"1979 from [[ASIN:B000000WA4 Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]].<br /><br />Many of these tunes are enveloped in darkness, more somber and less petty than the teenage angst that infiltrated some of the Smashing Pumpkins' music in the early 1990s. (In terms of mood and aura, think in the realm of The Cure's [[ASIN:B000002H70 Disintegration]] from 1989.) In any case, \\"Adore\\" is an excellent record, tuneful and splattered with delicate sounds and sad themes, issues like losing a mother you were close to (\\"Once Upon a Time\\" and \\"For Martha\\"). Midway through, the album hits a tedious snag on \\"Tear\\" and \\"Crestfellen,\\" yet picks back up with the poppy dance groove of \\"Appels + Oranjes.\\" From  there, the music becomes some of Corgan's boldest -- even best -- output at this point of his career.<br /><br />As \\"Adore\\" winds down, interesting tunes include the Westernlike feel of \\"The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete,\\" \\"Annie-Dog,\\" where Corgan's vocals sound resigned, ragged and tired, and the snail-paced \\"Shame,\\" a tune carried by one simple echoed guitar lick. Though \\"Adore\\" ends on a quiet, peaceful note, the album wraps up with a definitive bang, due to truly heartfelt emotion and genuinely stirring music. One element that makes these songs so heartwrenching is the piano Corgan incorporates. Though far from Billy Joel at the keyboard, Corgan writes some very sweet melodies on piano, no different than his guitar work. The use of piano on such greats as \\"Annie-Dog,\\" \\"Blank Page\\" and especially \\"For Martha\\" lifts this album to a higher level. In fact, \\"For Martha\\" stands out as one of Corgan's best, most emotional tunes ever.<br /><br />It's kind of sad that this CD began the downfall of the Pumpkins' commercial success. Even worse, Billy Corgan was left defending himself for creating such a different, beautiful record. Some have said this album suffers from lack of a full-time drummer and a synthetic drum sounds on most songs. Others complain it doesn't rock hard enough. In my view, though, \\"Adore\\" suffers from nothing more than people who lack the  imagination and tolerance to change and grow with a talented artist,  someone willing to diversify and enhance his already creative  personality. Give the Smashing Pumpkins credit for trying new things, and give this record a try with open ears and an open mind.makes these songs so heartwrenching is the piano Corgan incorporates.

B00003CWLF|5.0|I went to see this movie with my wife,and loved it.  Although many men would consider this a &quot;chick flick&quot;, it had everything that makes a movie great(love, intrigue, action, adventure, etc.I would recomend this  movie for anyone, especially couples to enjoy a movie together.
0767836286|3.0|I bought this one on DVD, but I doubt I'll ever watch it more than once.  The film is interesting to start with.  But, its ending is far too bleak to  really appreciate it.  Its dark ending is unique, but I didn't enjoy it all  that much.  Plus there were so many analogies with the tragedy involving  the Oklahoma City bombing that it made the the film much less enjoyable.   In addition, there's an analogy with the Waco tragedy as well.<br />The film  at first almost validates the concerns of militia groups with government  intervention in people's lives.  Then, the movie breaks down into a  conspiracy theory mode involving an evil anti-government terrorist group  that is American-based.<br />I'll give it three stars because of the unique  premise and story.  But, the tragic topics that the film makes reference to  quickly add to the downward spiral of bleakness the movie falls into  towards the end.<br />For those who still want to see the film (there is a  fairly intense plot thread that drives a majority of the movie), I'd  recommend only renting it.  This one's not a keeper.

B000003TAB|5.0|When I bought this quietly released collection of Nirvana B-sides back in 1993, I was astounded at the high quality of music from top to bottom, no different from all other Nirvana albums. If this is the bottom of the  barrel for Nirvana, then other bands might as well pack it in right now and find something else to do. Strangely, a reviewer in Rolling Stone magazine claimed \\"Incesticide\\" displayed Nirvana's tendancy to \\"fail\\" on  occassion. I'm not exactly sure what that person was listening to, because \\"Incesticide\\" is top-notch, A-side stuff.<br /><br />The first and last songs on \\"Incesticide\\" are classic Nirvana.  Sandwiched in between is Kurt Cobain at arguably his rawest, most fruitfully creative peak. With no pressure of a new studio album on his hands, Cobain lets these early Nirvana songs flow out naturally, one after another. This is very exciting music. The leadoff track, \\"Dive,\\" is a heavy-handed reminder as to why these guys were the best in the world when they toured and made albums together. With a searing shout-along chorus, thumping drums and a tuned-down guitar sound, it's one of Nirvana's best songs ever. Three other outstanding songs come in the form of cover songs: \\"Turnaround,\\" \\"Molly's Lips\\" and \\"Son of a Gun\\" all display Cobain's unique and obscure taste in music, especially simple pop music with a punk flavor. The guy had a knack for picking excellent, yet obscure, songs by other bands and putting his own cool spin on them. He was a master songwriter who had an amazingly keen ear for melody, writing punk songs that mainstream music listeners could easily enjoy.<br /><br />After \\"(New Wave) Polly,\\" \\"Incesticide\\" turns decidedly more quirky, yet no less engaging. If you dig Nirvana even a little bit, you'll enjoy songs like \\"Beeswax,\\" \\"Mexican Seafood\\" and the perversely classic rock sound of \\"Aero Zeppelin.\\" But it's \\"Aneurysm\\" that steals the show on the back-half of the album, and as awesome as it sounds, a better demo version exists on a rare Nirvana album that I own. It sometimes seems like the rawer these guys sounded, the better they were.<br /><br />The punk/pop music on this record is not to be missed. These songs have a somewhat brighter sound than the ones on [[ASIN:B0000035E7 Bleach]], while retaining a naturalness and a lack of polish that so predominated (and ruined, in Kurt Cobain's mind) the sound on [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]]. Cobain had his hand all over this record, from the actual writing of the songs to the cover artwork to an interesting message he leaves in the CD booklet. He nearly always gave his fans their money's worth, and this album is no exception. Another Nirvana can never exist.lbum that I own.

B000001OAA|4.0|great debut!:):):):):):)Not many bands have good debuts..because they just start out and they havent got the feel of being a close ,tight band.But Garbage did a great job.Thanks to Butch Vig and Shirly who really make the  album the best.<br />1.Supervixen-good song! i like the lyrics... 2.Queer-an  okay song but its still worthy 3.Only Happy When It Rains-great song!good  music! 4.Heaven Is Wide- Great music and creative lyrics 5.Not My Idea-Its  hard,then poppy,pretty awesome!  6.Stroke Of Luck-great lyrics,eery  music.Superb!  7.Vow-what can i say..but HELL YEAH! 8.Stupid Girl-Pretty  good!...very poppy.. 9.Dog New Tricks-kind of techno pop happy,but good  10.My Lover's Box-very good chorus and nice music 11.Fix Me Now-good  chorus,other vocals sound silly 12.Milk-dont like it much but its still  pretty...
6302649943|3.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviews in that the first part of the movie is a heck of a lot better than the second.  &quot;It&quot; is one of Stephen King's better books, but the movie does leave a little to be  desired.<br />The acting is fairly good in the movie, as Tim Curry plays one  of the freakiest bad guys ever as Pennywise the Clown.  Harry Anderson and  Anette O'Toole add in steller performances to an already good cast.   <br />Pennywise terrifies a group of young outcasts in a New England town,  bringing out their own deep-rooted fears.  One day, they fight back, only  to have &quot;It&quot; return thirty years later.<br />The ending definately  could have been done better, as the climax doesn't live up to the previous  scenes.  The flashbacks in the film are done nicely, and the suspense keeps  you on the edge of your seat pretty much throughout.  All in all, the film  is a pretty good thriller with lots of intrigue and mystery.
B00000J8EK|5.0|The Chemical Brothers really outdid themselves on their most acidic release yet. The theme of the record seems to be psychedelic textures layed out on a futuristic base. It is all very dreamy and reminds me of Primal  Scream colliding with Moby. You may think this seems a bit mixed up, but  somehow it all works its way together. This is a rocky album as well,  featuring guests from Mazzy Star, New Order, and Oasis, whose Noel  Gallagher adds a Beatlesque touch to the brilliant Let Forever Be. The  crunching big beats seem to disappear on this album, for the better, and  this is a required touch for making it such a great dream-techno record.  Each song has its own feel to it, Let Forever Be's Beatlemania, Out Of  Control's frantic trance, or Music: Response's early computer noise. This  is a vivid collection of sound, which can be easily used at clubs and raves  around the world. The Chemical Brothers and Moby are really taking techno  to new places, mixing it with blues, jazz, and folk, and thus creating a  beautiful sound as well. The cover art is amazing, and I would really like  to find out the artist. This record really makes me think to the future,  and thus one of the most moving ones I own.
B000002HRE|4.0|After reviewing Load, I decided to give Reload a chance. I was fearing that the album was going to be a waste of time (much like my fears about Load), but, yet again, Metallica suprised me. The CD opens up with Fuel,  probably the most famous song on the album. Its fairly fast compared to the  rest of the album. The Memory Remains is another single. Marianne  Faithfull's tired, raspy voice adds SO much to this song. Its just  beautiful. Devils Dance is the perfect &quot;strip&quot; song (my  girlfriend did just that in front of me while the song was playing). The  Unforgiven II is almost as good as its predecessor. Better Than You is a  pretty heavy song, with growling vocals that are kinda creepy. Slither is  just awesome. I love the beginning. Carpe Diem Baby is a catchy tune, one  of my favorites on the disc. Bad Seed is very unique for a 'Tallica song. I  can't seem to get into Where the Wild Things Are or Prince Charming, or  Attitude, so I'll skip on those. Low Man's Lyric is probably the best slow  song Metallica ever recorded. I LOVE that little hurdy-gurdy noise. It will  either have you humming along or skipping the track entirely. The last song  is also the best song... Fixxxer. The structure is very similar to Outlaw  Torn from Load, and this is CERTAINLY not a bad thing.<br />I took off a star  for the same reason I took off a star for Load... Not every song is good.  It may not be a perfect album, but its a damn good one.
0140281622|1.0|I thought that this book moved very slowly.  It was also very hard to get in to.  After I figured out how the Steinbeck was writing the novel, it became a bit easier.  I thought that the Joad chapters were too long and  could have been broken down to read easier.  As a lover of  historical/fiction, I thought this was a bad book because, although it  portrayed an accurate storyline, it was just not written well.  I would not  suggest this book to anyone who does not have to read it.
B00003CX95|5.0|From the first time I've seen this movie it became my favorite.  I think that after you see it you will never be the same again.

As I read reviews of this movie and  research the actual Gia Marie Carangi, I realize that Angelina Jolie  perfectly portrays this legend.  As soon as i saw it on HBO, I recorded it  as soon as it came on again.  Then very soon after that I had to order it.   This movie is so astounding, that everyone that watched it with me loved it  as much as I did.

It only took me 25 hours to finish reading this book, and now I am on my way to get the second book &quot;Speaker of the dead&quot;. <br />The story was told with very  simple word, but the story itself is not simple at all. I specifically  liked the twist at the ending. It's marvelous work!

B00003CX59|5.0|Don't waist your time thinking about getting it, just buy, this is the ultimate a** kicking movie of the century!
6300216802|1.0|This movie sank like the Titanic.  The first 50 minutes were good.  Then you start saying to yourself, &quot;What am I doing in front of the TV?&quot;  The movie spent too much time inside the alien (V'Ger):  It  spent about 80 minutes in the alien.  The problem was that they had nothing  to do in that time segment.<br />When they tried to pull two people from the  transporter (including the new science officer).  When they said the people  were going into final form, or something like that, you say, &quot;Oh, wow.   That's nice.&quot;<br />So basically, I don't think it was a good first  movie.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is my first Moby purchase, and I was totally blown away by this CD. There is a certain grace and beauty about &quot;Play&quot; that I would not have thought possible in the &quot;techno&quot; genre until I listened to  this. It's hard to list the highlights because every song is a highlight in  itself. &quot;Find my baby&quot;, &quot;Why does my heart feel so  bad?&quot;, &quot;Natural blues&quot;, and especially &quot;Run on&quot;  are masterful examples of taking sampled &quot;field recordings&quot;, with  all the passion of the (fairly unknown) original artists and weaving them  into a beautiful tapestry of modern music. The finale, &quot;My  weakness&quot; is absolutely stunning. I didn't want it to end! <br />I have  been very disgruntled with the general direction of popular music the last  couple of years, with the likes of Korn, Limp Biskit, Kid Rock, and Eminem  dominating popular taste. But an album like &quot;Play&quot; gives me hope  for the future of music.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a must have for any anime fan. I went and saw this movie in the theater not even knowing what it was about, but this film really surprised me. It is one of the best anime films of all time.  Princess Mononoke is about a prince who must leave his village because he  becomes cursed by a god. After he leaves, he meets many people in friendly  villages, but one particular person catches his eye, a wild woman who lives  with the wolves, the one that they call Princess Mononoke. If you are an  anime fan, you should definately check this movie out. The voice acting is  incredible, with an all-star cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup,  Claire Danes, and Minnie Driver. Princess Mononoke does have a lot of  violence and blood in it, so I would not reccommend it for young viewers.  Also, the animation in Princess Mononoke is spectacular! It will amaze you  how wonderfully drawn it is.
6303201962|4.0|Second best Star Trek ever.  The reason I gave it four stars is because Chekov wasn't in the first Khan episode.  Also, it was a good movie, lasted a good time, had good action.  It was basically all good.
0792153367|4.0|I thought this movie was charming, light and extraordinarily modern for its time.  Hepurn was perfectly cast for this role.  (Marilyn Monroe, the first choice in casting, would not have done the film justice.) This is the  first film of hers that I have seen, and now I am a fan.  She is completely  adorable in this character. I was intrigued by the storyline.  It was  different.  One never sees many films about a free-spirited, indepedent  women - very unlike the typical stereotype.  She exuded such an appealing  sense of innocence.  She was free and non-judgemental.  She didn't get hung  up on men, like the typical hollywood romance.  They came to her!  Anyhow...for a little movie getaway to one woman's life in nyc - one not so  caught up in the details, but caring and just trying to survive and have  fun, without all the grand, ostentatious wealth (just basically playing  dress up for fancy-sake)- she is a dreamer who runs into unexpected love.  You come away feeling nice.  One last comment - completely unexpected to  have Mickey Rooney in this film, playing the Japenese landlord.  More  strange than funny.
6305537798|5.0|10 Things I Hate About You is a funny yet smart movie that is great. What make it even better is that it is loosely based on the Shakespearean play, &quot;The Taming Of The Shrew&quot;.Newcomer Heath Ledger(Patrick Verona in  the movie) shined.   I totally fell in love with the character of Kat(Julia  Stiles). I think she is someone alot of teens can realate to. And when you  add Joey(Andrew Keegan), Micheal(David Krumholtz) and the rest of the cast  to the mix and what you get is a hilarious, sexy comedy.

They have music on this album which is definitely good on the ears,  and enjoyable to listen to.  why is Blink being called sellouts?

B00000K0DT|3.0|When the Usual Suspects was first released, it polarized critics and audiences alike.  Some lauded the film for it's sinuous, unpredictable plot and nimble direction.  Others dismissed it as tediously complex and  incomprehensible.  As with most such films the truth (if I may be so  presumptuous) is found between the two extremes.<br />The plot revolves around  a police interview with a disabled criminal (Verbal Kint) and a detective  (Dave Kujan).  Verbal was one of five individuals who were blackmailed to  rob a ship by a mysteriously unidentified criminal mastermind named Keyser  Soze.  The other four were killed during the robbery attempt.  Dave is  questioning Verbal to find out what happened.  The film contains several  flashbacks as told by Verbal.  The film does not reveal the identity of  Soze until the conclusion.<br />The characters in the film are generally well  acted, but superficial; they only serve as vehicles to propel the plot.   There isn't anything intrinsically wrong with this, but it proves to be a  crucial flaw later on. <br />The story of The Usual Suspects is very intricate  and difficult to follow.  Though this makes the film challenging at times,  it's often so convoluted that I was often tempted to give up on it.  During  the interview, Verbal eventually gives contradictory accounts of what  happened.  This a crucial element of the story that will determine how the  viewer interprets the ending, either with genuine surprise or  disbelief.<br />The conclusion is what seems to make viewers love or hate this  film.  Most people seem to be genuinely surprised (though some have said  they weren't at all) by the identity of Soze.  Though surprising, the  ending seems to require that the viewer suspend a tremendous amount of  disbelief:  It just doesn't SEEM to make sense.  It would be one thing if  the film out-smarted me, I would have appreciated that.  Instead, the  implausibility of the conclusion left me feeling cheated.  <br />If the filmis examined more closely it may make more reasonable sense than it seems  (it is complicated enough to allow this possibility), but the superficial  nature of the characters doesn't motivate the viewer to do this.  The  characters aren't interesting enough to make us want to understand the  conclusion.  I don't think this flaw completely detracts from the strengths  of The Usual Suspects, but it is certainly significant.<br />The Usual  Suspects does have quite a bit going for it:  Riveting direction,  interesting dialog, good acting, and a very clever (if often  incomprehensible) plot.    The screenplay and story have many of the same  elements as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  What makes Pulp Fiction a superior  work is that Taranino never pretends to make the film more than what it is:   A clever, unpredictable piece of storytelling, making the viewer feel  surprised and satisfied.  In The Usual Suspects, Singer seems to tease the  audience into thinking that there is more to the film than there truly is  (or at least seems).  Consequently, the viewer feels short-changed.<br />The  Usual Suspects has been most accurately likened to a cinematic card trick:   While you are watching it, the slight of hand is entertaining the first  time you see it.  Once the trick is finished, you probably won't think  about it again.  The Usual Supects is worth seeing for it's considerable  initial entertainment value, but once you find out the ending, what  occurred before is no longer interesting (or relevant).  Since it conveys  no emotional resonance, the film isn't worth seeing more than once, and  certainly isn't one of the best films of the 1990's.

B000035Z3K|4.0|Apologies for the dire title of my review - fortunately the DVD itself is of a far higher standard. One Universal's Classic Monster Collection, 'Dracula' looks the most dated of this DVD series. This probably owes more  to its stage play roots than the fact it is the oldest movie of the series.  Make no mistake though, we are still talking about a film 'classic'. Well  actually we're talking about TWO film classics. This comprehensive DVD also  features the much praised but rarely seen Spanish version of 'Dracula'.  Technically better, but lacking the Bela Lugosi portrayal, the Spanish  version is a most welcome addition to the DVD. David Skal's commentary is  also very worthwhile as is the 'Dracula' documentary. In fact I've been  surprised at just how good all the documentaries accompanying these  Universal DVDs have been. I would probably rate 'Dracula' as the weakest  entry in the 'Classic Monster Collection', but that is only due to the high  standard of the other releases. On its own, 'Dracula' is a fine DVD and one  I recommend to all vintage horror buffs.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Let me start by saying this, if you haven't seen this movie you've missed out on one of the true originals. I know it's a sequel but nevertheless it has set a standard in the industry which has yet to be surpassed. In all  sci-fi movies I now watch I see how many references/rip-offs/tributes I can  tally, the number has never been under seven. The fact that 14 years later  it is still the best, most effective, and without a doubt the scariest  alien genre film produced for the screen makes it my favorite film.<br />In  James (best visual effects Oscar) Cameron's epic sequel to the 1979 classic  Aliens, Lt. Ripley returns, frozen, 57 years later to Gateway Station  orbiting earth. \\"The company\\" investigates the loss of the cargo ship in  the first film, which she destroys to kill the alien, and of course they  think she's crazy when she tells them stories of aliens that gestate in  human hosts and have acid for blood. They revoke her flight status,  effectively ruining her career.<br />Visited by nightmares that leave her in a  cold sweat every single night, it is clear the demons are not gone and she  is racked with a need for retribution and closure. After losing contact  with a \\"shake and bake\\" colony Ripley is approached by a representative of  the company, Carter Burke, and the colonial marines. They want her to  return to LB427 and advise the team of elite marines going in. At first she  is reluctant, rude even, but the promise of a reinstated flight status and  her recurring dream proves too much and she agrees to go. <br />Once there  they discover every single colonist missing, \\"Whatever happened here I  think we missed it\\". After a bit of technical know-how is utilized the  colonists are located and they discover the terrifying truth. In the  issuing battle most of the team is lost and Ripley is left to organize  what's left and find a way out, but the aliens prove to be much smarter  than anticipated, cutting them off at every turn. On top of that it is  revealed that Burke has double-crossed Ripley in the name of millions of  dollars.<br />In Roger Ebert's 1986 review he said, \\"I have never seen a movie  that maintains such a pitch of intensity for so long\\". Almost the entire  last half of this film is pure action, and some of the best ever put on  film. In an interview on the DVD edition, which I highly recommend, James  (I can spend more money than you) Cameron said something like, I think too  many puppeteers focus on details and forget that the most important thing  is movement. People need very few pixels to recognize a human, but movement  makes it - real, and that's what's scary.<br />That single, yet all-important  knowledge made it possible to film this movie with only six costumes  (you'll be amazed when you realize this as you watch), and made it possible  to create creatures so believable there hasn't been an original alien  design since. <br />Transporting us to another world, this film makes us  forget we are in our comfortable homes with a warm sweater and buttery  popcorn. Instead we feel the panic of the terrified marines as countless  aliens leap and screech, it makes us feel the pure adrenaline-pumped primal  need to survive under all circumstances.<br />Notable performances include  Sigourney Weaver, who was nominated for best actress. Paul Raiser, giving a  standard-setting performance as the corporate slime. Michael Biehn, in the  classic yet somehow not tired role of the exhausted I've-seen-too-much team  leader.<br />The film was nominated by the Academy or won in the following  categories: Best Actress, Art Direction, Film Editing, Score, Sound, Sound  Effects Editing and of course - Visual Effects.
B0000070QN|5.0|Canadian Rocker Harem Scarem and German hard rocker Fair Warning are those of most unrecognized finest rockers during the 90s. Mood Swing is the No.1 90s rock album I have encountered so far. Great 90s albums following this  gem piece include Fair Warning's Go, Hardline's Double Eclipse,  Def  Leppard's Euphoria, Steelhouse Lane's two masterpieces, Jimi Jamison's  Empires, Mark Free's Long Way From Love. If you are fans of above titles I  mentioned this is the one you must have whether you like it or not. It  shows the great moment of rock'n roll history you can never miss.<br />My #1  pick from this album is Stranger Than Love. The first intro will give you  the strong immpression which will last a lifetime. Second pick from the  album is No Justice which became smash hit in U.S. And Sentimental BLVD is  a multilayered intricate melodic rocker which will get you hypnotized as  you listen repeatedly. Mandy is a killer instrumental. And by the time you  listen to the last three bombardment of killer tracks, it is hard for you  to resist the temptation to listen to the whole album from the  beginning.<br />They music is like Queen, Night Ranger, Van Halen, Vital Signs  era Survivor combined. Or much deeper than that. If you are a serious rock  fan. It is a must.
B00004SST6|3.0|I recently purchased &quot;Absolute Benson&quot; and I must say that I was a little disappointed with the cd.  I am a 100% George Benson fan which makes this hard for me to write.  I guess I expected more of an upbeat  &quot;Latin Style&quot; cd with more vocals.  Of course, all the musicians  on the cd are great ones and I do own several selections by them also.  A  few of the selections on this cd are slow and seem to drag out. I do have  to say that two of the selections, &quot;The Ghetto&quot; and   &quot;El  Barrio&quot; are really great and no doubt cool! Sorry George--not one of  my favorites!

And speaking about the &quot;boys&quot;,  they are all professionals from Juillard School, so it does't matter if  they are apart from each other for few or many years, it just clicks when  they start jamming together. For them it's an easy job. That's why I think  this is their best CD ever made. Do I wish you luck!

I have owned the book for a long time, and just recently decided to read it, but it was a  wonderful read. I liked the informal and personal style McCourt writes  with, that was only a small part of the book's effect. I learned a lot  about immigrant's in America, conditions that the poor lived in here and in  Irealand, and about family structure in a time when family values was not a  buzz word like it is today. The characters in the story come to life and it  McCourt makes it possible to relate to them and understand them. It is a  wonderful book and one that I do not think a personal library should be  without.

Do not intrude on his cave, keep &quot;score&quot; of how much  each does for the other, do less so as to keep the &quot;score&quot; even,  and avoid all competition and confrontation as this will only cause the  woman to get &quot;minus points.&quot;   On the otherhand, if you want to  know how to get along in a real relationship with a MAN or a WOMAN - this  book is not the book for you!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|FUN is what I call performance of the orchestra musicians and their Maestro M.Kamen. On the other hand Metallicas hard work was as good as always: solid, clean, spearing heavy metal music with simplicity and  tremendous clarity that distinguishes them form the rest of the heavy metal  pack. Together, Metallica and Philharmonic Orchestra created a stunning  piece of monumental mix music, new Millennium worth. Technical side of the  2 DVD's production is exceptional although could have better quality  picture (to dark and sometimes vaguely seen background)good angles. Sound,  (Dolby digital 5.1)awesome. My Yamaha amplifier and Klipsch high power  speakers(5) helped me attain desire quality reception of that music (need  that Metallica power kick in your chest!)Must have DVD! is only suggestion  to Metallica fans and not only. One of the best(if not THE best)rock  concerts on DVD yet!
B00004TL21|5.0|This band is absolutely incredably- The lead singer's voice- as someone else mentioned is &quot;hypnotic- and the guitar music is scary in a nice way&quot;. This band is unlike others- I think they have serious talent in  making their music a blend of metal, rock and maybe even techno (like Moby  kind of techno). And also they got a guy with an incredable voice- so this  band has a lot of things that none others have. Go Deftones! (but make your  lyrics a little less dirty) ;-)
B000002LLC|5.0|&quot;I'm Breathless&quot; is the most experimental album Madonna has ever made.  Then again, Madonna is all about reinventing herself and taking  risks (unlike some of her contemporary female rivals who churn out the same  formula over and over).  This album is also her most underrated.  Which is  a shame because this album is absolutely amazing. The 40's themed songs and  the Cuban-Flavored &quot;I'm Going Bananas&quot; are great, catchy, and  theatrical.  The songs also adds to and reveals information as to who  Breathless Mahoney is (Madonna's character in DICK TRACY).  Hence, the  reason why this album is called &quot;I'm Breathless&quot;.  The album  gives us a musical biography of this exciting character's life.   Madonna  does very well with all the songs...and she successfully rises up to the  challenge of singing THREE songs by one of the most BRILLIANT Broadway  composers of the 20th Century, STEPHEN SONDHEIM.  Again, let's see her  contempories take up a challenge like that. And, to top herself, Madonna  ends the album with &quot;Vogue&quot;.  Surprisingly, &quot;Vogue&quot;  fits in nicely in this 40's sounding album.  In conclusion, this album,  along with &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;, and &quot;Like a  Prayer&quot;, is a must-have for Madonna fans and people who want to hear  what &quot;creative experimentation&quot; and &quot;pushing the boundaries  of your artistry&quot; sounds like.
B000002UB6|5.0|From what I read,&quot;Let it Be&quot; was a mess.Phil Spector was given hours of tapes,and was told to make an Album of this junk.He was in his glory.Phil Spector had little respect for other Artist.He always took  over,and made the records into what he wanted them to sound like.Years  later,when he worked with  Lennon,John had to lay down the law,and they  became a great team.The Beatles were already broke up when this album came  out,and were shocked to hear the over production,especially on &quot;The  Long and Winding Road.&quot;I think this is a great album,even though you  can tell the Beatles were not into there music anymore.Even the film,with  everyone fighting,and Paul telling George and Ringo how to play Guitar and  Drums.If you are a Beatles fan,you have to get this CD,even though Phil  Spector  makes this record so different from all the other Beatle albums  that George Martin produced.

006016848X|1.0|If you and your spouse aren't getting along before reading the book, look out - the sparks may just start flying faster after reading it!    It is filled with bad advice.  As a woman, I found it insulting that my husband  just has to pretend that he is listening. Greys basic advice to men - make  her believe she is being heard - it doesn't matter if you are thinking  about the football game etc., just nod, grunt and say uh-huh - that's all  she requires.  Even if you make the effort to hear (I won't even mention  the word listen) it doesn't matter, she's just babbling on and on anyway.   And, that's all the communication the relationship requires, because as a  male you don't really have any thoughts or feelings to share yourself. If  you can even talk.  Hello - Real communication comes from the mutual desire  of both parties to understand each other- which requires active, HONEST  listening and verbalizing by both parties.  Secondly, he believes that all  men must retreat into their caves and must NOT be disturbed - especially by  a bimbo - or look out the caveman might just come out with his club. He is  very unfair in dealing with both genders' capacity to communicate with each  other.  I think the information in this book has the potential of making a  strained relationship worse. We stopped reading it. We were beginning to  argue about the things in the book - thinking the other person was possibly  doing the stereotyped activity - i.e going to the cave - not wanting to be  disturbed, not listening, etc., when it wasn't the case at all. It  literally provided more argumentative material for our  &quot;discussions&quot;. Obviously, I don't recommend this book.  We have  done much better without it.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever listened to, the most influential hard-rock CD of the '90s, and the one with some of the most authentic anger.   RATM's main-stream debut paved the way for Korn, Limp Bizkit,  Slipknot, etc., and although all of those bands are good, Rage blows them  out of the water. With excellent instrumentals and Zack de la Rocha's  amazing lyrics (rap-screamed quite effectively)...well, you'll understand.  If you severely disagree with RATM's message, buy this CD anyway and it  might convert you. The next two CDs are good but not on the level of this  one. So go out and buy this CD!
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is the kind of movie that, without any shadow of a doubt, will recieve a backlash. It was overly loved at the time it came out, so I believe there will be a certain amount of the opposite later. And this is  truly undeserved. While it may not be the greatest film of '99 (which the  awards suggest) in practically any other year from the last 10 I would  rarely have agrued. My own personal problem is that while American Beauty  is a great film, it's nothing compared to some of the films from last year.  Now, I love this film. It's the kind of thing Hollywood never does enough.  It is a damn fine film. Spacey is great, Bening has never been better (but  is that so hard?) and Sam Mendes reminds everyone why we should let more  Brits make movies. We've just got far more subtlety and intelligence than  your usual Hollywood director. The script is great, filled with wonderful  dialogue and some great charcters. In fact, I can hardly say anything bad  about his movie. The only thing is that maybe, just maybe, the guy next  door isn't quite a strong enough character. And it's just not as good as  some of the other films which were over-looked in '99. But don't let me put  you off. This film is excellent. Buy it! Watch it! Now! Honest!
6302415993|5.0|Gimme Shelter is the Casablanca of rock n' Roll cinema in that  everyone who loves it swears up and down that films lynchpin horrifying incident  occurs during Sympathy for the Devil.If this were true it would certainly  be more aesthetically pleasing and strengthen my faith because if someone  was killed during Sympathy for the Devil then there must be a devil and  therefore must also be a god but it is a myth since the films celebrated  incident occurs during &quot;under my Thumb&quot; just as surely as  Humphrey Bogart never said &quot;play it again sam&quot; he said &quot;you  dirty rat you killed my brother&quot; or i don't know exactly what he said  but i do know in this movie the sh1t goes down during &quot;under my  thumb&quot;. Watch it and you'll see.Gimme Shelter is a musical heist gone  wrong movie on par with Resevoir Dogs or the Killing with roughly the same  sort of vibe as those films.The music in the film is excellent in  particular Rolling Stone's version of Robert Johnsons &quot;love in  vain&quot; the most beautiful piece of music ever made and people will know  that 1000 years from now.
6305558175|1.0|Now, Sommersby. Well. Until January of this fine year 2000, this was the worst film I had ever seen in my life. I really would love this film to be burnt. But not as much as a film which doesn't appear to be here. a film  called Rancid Aluminium. Now that was truly the most appalling thing, let  alone film, that I have ever seen in my entire life.  And Sommersby is just  behind it.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Its truely amazing the things people would rather have than money. Why in gods name this piece of filth made it into even the top one thousand should be the 8th wonder of the world. I sincerely doubt that even a quarter of  the people that bought this did so for any reason other than the slew of  pictures that it came with. She's pretty hot, we all know that. But that  DOES NOT mean she has an ounce of talent whatsoever. Wynona Rider should  release a cd. I'm sure someone would buy it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I'll keep this short. This is, without any doubt, the best film made since, well, probably Seven. I'm not going to explain plot or anything about the film other than... WATCH IT!  NOW!  Then... WATCH IT AGAIN!   But now, the DVD. Well, in the future we'll probably get DVD's with more.  Probably. But what we'll never get is such a complete, perfect package. But  the thing is, if you love the film you've already got it. And if you hate  it, all I can say is try watching it again. And for those who aren't quite  sure, well. If you like &quot;no brainers&quot;, if that's what really gets  you going then this is probably not for you. And I sympathise. But if you  like things a little different. If you like movies that make you think.  Then you should love it.
B00004S6GL|4.0|I bought this c.d. with a sense of fear and trepidation.The fear was so great it took me a couple of weeks to actually play it at all.You see the reason is I loved Elliot Smith's previous c.d. X O so much I thought there  is no way he could even come close to matching it on this follow up.   Initially I was very dissappointed-gone were the acoustic driven,low key  classics on the previous c.d.But if you persevere with this c.d. it is  incredibly rewarding.Yes it is far more 'produced' than the last one-but it  is still sensitive enough to allow each song stand out to show what a high  calibre singer song-writer Smith is.Very few artists have his song-writing  versatility.He uses a full backing band on most songs and they show great  sensitity in not drowning out his work.No this c.d. is not over-produced  one iota.  Trying to pick out a stand out track is virtually impossible,as  the 16 tracks are all excellent.But my own favourite if I had to pick one  would be track 11 'Color Bars'-complete with acoustic guitar,piano and a  beautiful string arrangement.The whole c.d. glides gently along for 52  minutes of the most soothing songs you are likely to hear anywhere.  This  c.d. is so good that I'm now dreading his next c.d.-cos if he can match  this one again than Elliot Smith must be the first singer-songwriter genius  of the 21st century!
6305807086|5.0|... No! Not John Malkovich. And, I suppose, not just a man's mind. More the mind of 2 men. Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze. Now, to me, 1999 was one of those great years in cinema. It was just marvellous. Most years you  wouldn't argue with American Beauty winning everything (not that that  REALLY matters). But in 1999. NO!  NO DAMN WAY!  So, it should have been  Malkovich then? Well, no. Over American Beauty, yeah! But sadly Spike Jonze  couldn't quite give us the best film of the year. But he was so close.  Explaining the plot of Malkovich would be pointless, but I think that  describing the plot of any mvie is stupid. You're supposed to watch the  damn thing to find out what's happening. But, any rate. Woah!  If you've  seen a film like this before you're luckier than me, coz I never had. What,  basically, you have here is fine performances by Cusack, Diaz and  Malkovich. A great one from Keener. We're introduced to the minds of Jonze  and Kaufman (2 minds I for one want to see more of). And, um.... Just stop  reading this review now. This and all other reviews. Just buy this movie.  Unless, of course, you're one of those people that doesn't like  &quot;wierd&quot; films. In which case, avoid (solely because you'll never  understand the beauty that you see)
B00004U9MS|4.0|Like many people I was totally blown away by the Coldcut single 'Yellow',which must rank as one of the singles of the year.  If you like Radiohead or Jeff Buckley,than I'm sure you'll really enjoy this c.d.The  music is fairly low-tempo,student art rock from the U.K.There are just ten  tracks on the c.d. and none of the tracks could be described as album  fillers.Unlike many groups this c.d. is just 41 minutes long-so listening  to the whole c.d. isn't the sort of chore you have with so many rap  artists,who make c.d.'s so long that it is really difficult to get familiar  with the songs.  Coldplay's sound is not very original and there are no  surprises on the c.d.But the songs are strong enough to be compared with  any group.The first song 'Don't Panic' is a gentle mid tempo song with  excellent rhythm,be it drumming or guitar.The chorus tells of how 'We live  in a beautiful world'which sets the mood of the album off on a cheerful  note.It is this kind of sentiment which has had many people comparing  Coldcut to Travis-I think the comparison is well justified.Track 2 'Shiver'  is one of the highlights of the c.d.,it was an early single.It is driven by  some excellent guitar.There is no doubt the lead vocalist has a voice of  great versatility and range,but one of the few drawbacks is that he  sometimes mimics Jeff Buckley.And on this song the resemblance is uncanny.I  think his voice sounds better when he isn't being so clearly influenced by  another vocalist.Track 3 'Spies' is a more sombre song,but is  excellent.Initially driven by an acoustic guitar and a beautifully echoed  electic guitar chord on the chorus.Track 4 'Sparks' could easily have been  on the Travis c.d. The Man Who...It is another excellent acoustically  driven song.Than we have the sublime love song 'Yellow'.'Trouble' sees  Coldplay using a piano for the first song-Excellent vocals on the song and  a real potential hit single.The title track only lasts for about 30 seconds  and divides the c.d. for the closing 3 strongly Radiohead influenced  songs.If Thom Yorke can produce 3 songs of similar quality on there next  c.d. we'll be in for something special.  Coldplay's c.d. is a must purchase  c.d. for any one who likes some of the groups I mentioned during the  review.I totally believe it will be a contender for any top 10 album of the  year list come December.
B00003CWOL|2.0|First he made a no-budget black and white comedy set in a store. Clerks. It was funny, clever and hugely enjoyable. Then he made the under-rated Mallrats. An enjoyable, yet idiotic, romp through a Mall. Then he tried  something more serious with the twisted love triangle and came out with  Chasing Amy, a film with some great moments, but never a truly satisfiying  whole. And now Dogma!  Which, let's face it, it a steamy pile of  pretentious Dogdo! OK, so, there's a couple of funny lines. Wow! And Silent  Bob and Jay are in it. Um, Wow!  And, um.... it's just garbage. A great  big sweaty pile of pretentious garbage. I'm so not looking forward to his  next film if this is that pattern of his career.
B00000255F|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's albums preceding Born to Run suffered poor commerical success despite rave critical reviews, partly because of poor sound quality from the recording studio.  At the time Born to Run was produced, Bruce  Springsteen knew that if he did not create a great album, Columbia records  were going to show him the door: the pressure was on!  During the  production of this album, there were various changes in personel: rock  critic Jon Landau offered his help in producing the album, which caused a  fall out with Springsteen's previous producer Mike Appel (a court battle on  the matter of who could produce Springsteen's music raged after the success  of Born to Run, causing the next album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, to be  kept back for 3 years).  One production arguement was on the capabilities  of the recording studio Appel used.  Landau acused Appel of using the  studio for financial reasons only.  This lead to Born to Run (the song),  being the only song recorded away from the Record Plant, New York, a studio  which had better facilities leading to a richer, clearer sound.  The  musicians were also changed; Vini Lopez, Springsteen's previous drummer was  fired, replaced by Ernest Carter who, after the title track, left with  David Sancious (keyboards) to form Tone.  The space of drummer was replaced  by Broadway drummer Max Weinberg and pianist Roy Bittan, also escaping from  Broadway, which meant that Springsteen had a lot more professional lineup.  The album starts with the soft twinkling piano of Roy Bittan and  Bruce Springsteen's gravelly voice before breaking into the full band  chorus of Thunder Road.  The sound from this album has been likened to the  crystal clear Wall of Sound of producer Phil Spector.  The album continues  through Tenth Avenue Freezeout, which has a distinct beat, not found on  earlier Springsteen songs.  This is probably due to the better technical  capabilities of Max Weinberg.  Some find that the song is too jerky, but I  disagree.  Night, the next track highlights Clarence Clemmons saxaphone  work, but I feel it is a mediocre song compared to the first two.  Backstreets begins with an extended piano introduction by the great Roy  Bittan and his pounding Yamaha C3 grand piano.  This is one of  Springsteen's epic songs which lasts a long time and features Springsteen's  poetic visions of teenage life on the boardwalks of New Jersey, however its  messages are universal- anyone can relate to his songs, which is part of  the reason for his success.  Born to Run thunders in.  This is probably one  of Springsteen's best known songs, besides Born in the USA.  It lives up to  its reputation as possibly the song which saved Springsteen's career as a  rock star.  Everything Springsteen was in it.  Poetic visions, thundering  drums, layers of lush keyboards (notice that the keyboards are mainly  electric pianos, which David Sancious seemed to prefer to play compared to  the better (in my books) Yamaha C3 grand pianos of Roy Bittan), and  electric guitars glistening in the background.  Again, we find the next  track is basically filler.  Bittan thunders through the piano part of She's  the one, the band play well but the song isn't up to the standard.  Next is  the film noir style Meeting across the River.  It slowly works its way  along with a hushed piano, acoutic bass, and a trumpet played by famous  session musician Michael Brecker.  This song creates the mood for  Jungleland, probably the best Springsteen tune around.  The two songs are  usually played together live, just like they are on the album and they go  together well to slower the pace from the franetic She's the One to the  majestic Jungleland.  It starts with strings and piano in a marvelous  musical way opening up to Springsteen's epic tale of a street fight between  a fleeing villain and the police.  About halfway in the build up of tempo  and tension is released by Clarence Clemmons massively powerful saxaphone  breaking intoan instrumental passage.  The band are playing as backup to  showcase Clarence's sax instrumental before it fades and Bittan plays a  beautiful sweet piano solo.  This culminates into an up tempo full band  close of the song, the album, and Springsteen's image of a struggling  artist under the label of a new Dylan.  This is probably the best  Springsteen album to date despite having one quarter of the tracks being  mediocre.  The rest of the album is superb and well worth investing in!breaking into an instrumental passage.

0913022101|1.0|When I read MEIN KAMPF(in the following MK) some weeks ago for the first time, I saw that all the trouble about this book is nothing but nonsense. MK is a book about the thoughts, ideology and fanatism of a man, whose  horrible madness brought the second World War. I cannot understand, why a  book like MK is a kind of bible for some people. It is terribly written,  full of grammatical and orthographical errors; the most terrible German I  have ever read. Because of being a history student, I can only see an  advantage of reading this &quot;work of art&quot;; only to understand the  ideas that made the ideology of the WWII. This book is worth to be bought  only, when the background is known. Without the background, this book is  nothing but dirt, just the thoughts of a madman. The only right way to use  this &quot;thing&quot; is to read it together with books like Winston  Churchills &quot;The Second World War&quot; and the Hitler biographies by  Joachim Fest or Ian Kershaw.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant filmmaker and cements his already sure status with this brilliant three hour opus. In 1997, he came into Hollywood with Boogie Nights, a 2 1/2 hour epic about a porn star's rise and fall in  1977. He preceeded that with Hard Eight, a 1997 film about gambling and the  relationship between a pro and a bum. His ear is for dialogue, his  characters are sympathetic and hopeful,and his real talents lie in the  brilliant Camera he possesses. He slipshods through like a roller coaster  and goes from one place to the next without missing a beat. He juggles nine  characters in the air with ease like some sort of balancing act star. I  have not seen the video,I hope to own a DVD player and the DVD of this film  some time soon(Christmas,hint,hint). But the film itself is something else  and really moved me. The Cruise-Robards relationship breaks down into a  horrifyingly real scene at a deathbed which had me realize what fragility  there is in time on Earth and how I needed to see my dad more often,no  matter how much of a jerk he is(I don't call him jerk-network censor).  Magnolia is indescribably,heartbreakingly,fast-paced brilliant.

It has all the right elements; sleezy, grity, sex, drama, dark humor, lots of violence, and lots of flowing cash.  Hollywood ganster mob film with texture, vitality, and great  cinamatagraphy. Never a dull moment. If you don't have this film in your  library your are really missing out. Oh and the acting is superb. In my  humble opinion Oscars all around. Entertainment to the highest level. Must  have movie.
B00004TDRD|5.0|I got this new anniversary release only for the &quot;Making of Jaws&quot; documentary and I can honestly say this was well worth the money.  The second tape comes with deleted scenes from the film, some great outtakes,  and several different original 1975 trailers for the film.  The documentary  itself was excellent.  Spielberg takes you back to 1975 with home movies of  behind-the-scenes action, discussing the technical aspects of making the  film, all of which was very, very interesting.<br />I definitely recommend  buying the video.

Eden, So Many Things, Anytime Anywhere, Dust In The Wind (well done remix),  Il Mio Cuore Va (Italian version of My Heart Will Go On), Time To Say  Goodbye and Only An Ocean Away are my most favorites!   I'd never heard  of her before until one day I heard Dust In The Wind on the radio and  waited for her name to be announced. I ran out and bought it!   I listened  to it all the times!   This is a must buy cd for anyone who likes  classical music and are her fans!   I highly recommend it!
6304457383|5.0|I first saw this movie in an after-school showing in our junior high school auditorium.  During one scene, every 13-year old girl in the big auditorium screamed at the top of her lungs, and my ears are still ringing  to this day....The movie is an excellent suspense thriller (more suspense  than horror, really).  What I enjoy about it is that the &quot;victim&quot;  does not just sit helplessly and scream, she fights back.  She is faced  with overwhelming odds, but she fights back against the bad guys, and even  figures out a way to turn her weakness into strength. The only criticism I  have of the movie is that the &quot;tough guys&quot; who are supposed to be  so scarey haven't aged well.  Grown men who fight with tv antennas and bike  chains just look silly in the days of gang-bangers with Uzis.  On the other  hand, Alan Arkin is still VERY creepy when he concentrates on being creepy  instead of frightening.  Despite the one aspect of it being a bit dated, I  highly recommend the movie.
6305537798|5.0|First of all, this movie is really great. I think this movie got lost in the teen movie of the week shuffle and it's shameful because it's the best of that genre.  I havent't read &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; which this  movie is based on but it has inspired me to pick it up.  I really like all  of the characters here - they weren't the stereotypical airheaded  teenyboppers that most movies seem to include.  Heath Ledger and Julia  Stiles steal the movie with their very strong performances.  Their  characters are the high point for me - they are both tremendously talented  actors (particularly Mr. Ledger - check out &quot;The Patriot&quot;).  I  look forward to them both having long careers.  Please give this movie a  chance.  I promise you won't hate it. PS I am far beyond my high school  years but I could still relate.

Example: The small king and the really fat queen running after the free  thinker  Alice, Alice being thrown out of the flower garden because she's  not their social type.

6305327041|2.0|I rented this movie because it seemed like it had a great cast (Bruce Willis is my favorite actor) and I am a big fan of Tarrantino.  However the movie turned out to be very disappointing.  It is about a bellhop (Roth)  who encounters some very interesting guests as he goes to 4 different  rooms.  I ended up turning off the movie in the third room because I  couldn't stomach any more.  <br />After watching the first hour and cringing  at each of the different rooms, I realized this was not for me.  There are  some very twisted thoughts in this movie.  The first room involves a bunch  of witches including Madonna and for some reason a couple (not Madonna  though) take their tops off.  The second room made even less sense, with a  drunk man a gun and his tied up wife.  As the bellhop went to each room I  got more and more disturbed and ended up turning it off and returning it  for something else.  <br />This movie is probably great for someone into cult  films, but I thought I was getting a comedy with a great cast and turned  out to be very disappointed.

B00000JGOJ|4.0|I thought this was an excellent movie.  I had seen previews for it before but hadn't really heard much about it.  It is definitely a chick flick so don't let the fact that it has Sean Connery fool you. It is about different  people and their love lives.  The character development is wonderful and  the acting superb. The story revolves aroung four seemingly unrelated  couples all in various stages of their lives and relationships.  Almost  anyone can relate to at least one of the characters in the movie, as people  struggle with death, illness, and love.   My only complaint with the movie  was that when the movie was over I wanted it to keep going.  The characters  entice you into the story and you want to keep watching to see how things  work out.<br />Overall it is a great movie that will make you smile, and  definitely worth renting.

6300273199|4.0|Despite the small stage and dark lighting, this was truly one of AC/DC's best performances. By the way, am I the only one who noticed Angus's shorts were unzipped for the ENTIRE first half of the show?
0553573403|5.0|Mr. Martin has woven an unforgettable tale of political intrigue and military action that had me clamoring for more at its conclusion.  To say that this book is a great fantasy novel is an injustice:  Game of Thrones  is one of the tightest and most rewarding stories I have read in any genre  in many years.<br />The story, in brief, focuses on different ruling houses,  most notably the Starks who rule in the ever-winter North.  Through some  wonderful prose, Martin fills in the reader on the history of the Starks as  the book's story unfolds.<br />Each of Martin's chapters are named for a  character and the perspective shifts from character to character as the  chapters shift.  Martin does this, however, while advancing the story at a  great lively pace.  You might think that a book from different perspectives  (by perspective I still mean the third person, its just that the chapter  looks at events through a certain person's eyes) would be slow and repeat  events.  Martin is too craftly to slow his story one bit.  And what a story  it is!<br />Here you have it all!  Intrigue, battles, a foreboding of evil to  come, magic, and best of all:  Characters that are real!  No cookie cutter  characters in this book.  Characters are complex and show many different  sides.  The bad guys (and its not that easy to pick them out) are smart and  anticipate.  (some writers, Martin not one of them, can't write villians  without making it clear that the person isn't just bad, he's  &quot;evil&quot;  No such clear lines in this one, folks.)This one is a  true masterpiece of the genre.  A Must Read for those of you yearning for a  challenging, well plotted tale of the grasp for the throne and for  survival.
0385487339|5.0|Les Liaisons Dangereuses have a special place in French Litterature. This book offer a perfect view on the libertinage during the 18th century, as well as the way of life of this period (school with cecile de Volange,  Marriage with both cecile and Mme De Merteuil, the situation of men :  Valmont and St Preux). What makes this book unique : its style, made of  letters, you can recognise all characters by his own style. Laclos really  gives life to all its characters, each of them having its own voice.  Moreover, the typical &quot;double language&quot; is unique. the story,  which is part a duel, part a romance.<br />According to me surely the best  book ever written. read it, you will love it
B0000024K1|5.0|this is definently one if not the best pe album. dope.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Britney is not my favorite artist, but I have to give her some credit for this album. It's not the best music ever written, but it is much better than her first album.  They lyrical quality could use some work and a lot  of the fast songs have the same beat. Most of the songs are somewhat  enjoyable except Dear Diary, which I think is really, really horrible and  sounds like someone in 5th grade wrote it. Of course this is the only song  partially written by Britney. I wouldn't take credit for that song if I  were her. There are only a couple good songs on this album like Oops...I  did it again, and One Kiss from You. All the other songs are kinda blah,  but you'll like them if you're a big pop fan. If I could buy this c.d. all  over again, I don't think I would. Maybe if it was on sale.
B00003CWL6|5.0|If you get this movie, you understand that it is one of the most beautiful (no pun intended) movies ever made.  Same Mendes and Alan Ball, both newcomers to movies, created a wonderful movie about a disfunctional  American family.  Kevin Spacey got a well deserved best acting Oscar, and  Wes Bentley gave an unbelievable performance as Ricky Fitts, the only  person in the film that can see the beauty of the world.  Never have I seen  a movie that can make me laugh and then make you just sit back and go  &quot;WOW&quot; within minutes of each other; the scene where the family is  eating dinner after Lester quits his job has to be one of the best acted  scenes I've ever seen.  This is not a movie for everyone - some people will  not truly understand it, but if you do, there is no finer movie to see.
B000002UVZ|5.0|This is REM's best work and one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Life's Rich Pageant is a spirited and complex journey; every time you listen to it you'll feel wonderfully worn out.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I got the DVD and it was awsume. It was full of suspense and the sound quality was great.
0375420525|4.0|In all the crazy fuss surrounding this novel--much of which it deserves--something has been lost: a sense of history. This book fits comfortably into a past defined by the work of Pynchon, Alasdair Gray,  Nabokov, and others. Very few of the devices used by the author are unique,  although he does use them well, for the most part. His use of footnotes,  however, is often out of control, to the point that he begins to annihilate  his own central narrative--a narrative that, despite the horror aspects, is  really a love story. This is the strength of the novel: the central  relationship between the photographer and his wife.<br />I'm a writer and, to  be honest, I could not tell whether my irritations with the narrative were  because I wished I had actually written the book or because the book does  have some flaws. Regardless, this is great stuff and I can't wait to read  his next novel.
B00003OSTR|4.0|For anyone sick of the &quot;nauseating MTV culture,&quot; then this is the movie for you. It perfectly portrays American culture and values in a way that is entertaining and meaningful. Gary Cooper is perfectly cast as  Alvin York and gives an Academy Award winning performance. Though Coop was  40 when this was made and is obviously too old for the part (and his  Southern accent isn't so good), his acting skills carry him  through.<br />Walter Brennan, always outstanding in any role, supports  brilliantly and Joan Leslie is believable as York's girlfriend.<br />Yes, this  movie is sappy and contrived in spots, but it's wonderful anyway. The  musical score is also memorable and integrated well throughout the film. If  you love Gart Cooper or American, it's hard not to like this movie.
B00000DFRS|4.0|I am so TIRED of the critics Slamming this album!  This was a good album. It wasn't perfect, but it was good, I hate it when the critics over analyze things! This was Cd was enjoyable and a very good album to turn on to  relax!  I am only 16 and was never really familiar with whiteny's earlier  work, but i became an instant fan with this album. I thought this cd was  just going to be some ol' timer coming back. Then I heard it and it was  great! I haven't bought the greatest hits yet, but i am planning on getting  it. Well to all the critics that put down this album, it has gone platinum  4x, heartbreak hotel.....platinum......it's not right, but it's  ok...approaching platinum,........my love is your  love(single)......platinum. Now you can tell the critics to shove that up  their.................!
0790743213|5.0|Forget &quot;Psycho,&quot; disregard &quot;The Birds.&quot; This is Hitchcock's finest movie. It has everything: marvelous, stylish acting by the incomparable Cary Grant, fine supporting performances by James Mason  and Eva Marie Saint and a plot that will have you on edge  throughout.<br />Yes, the plot is contrived and improbable and the Mt.  Rushmore sets are obviously fake and unrealistic-looking, but these are  minor annoyances. Cary Grant effortlessly charms his way throughout this  movie (note the auction scene and Cary's comedic timing. His scens with  Saint crackle with sexual innuendo, especially their famous train  clinch.<br />This is a movie you watch again and again and you'll always find  things you had missed during the previous viewings. If you love Cary Grant,  Hitchcock or suspenseful thrillers, this is the movie for you.
0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris's new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day, tells a most unconventional life story. It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes (&quot;There was the lisp, of course, but more  troubling than that was my voice itself with its excitable tone and high,  girlish pitch&quot;) and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From  budding performance artist (&quot;The only crimp in my plan was that I  seemed to have no talent whatsoever&quot;) to &quot;clearly  unqualified&quot; writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris's career leads him to  New York (the sky's-the-limit field of furniture moving) and eventually, of  all places, France.<br />I recommend it to all!
6303593666|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl was a genius and this film proves it. Her autobiography shows that her life was ruined after 1945 because she had been a willing pawn to Hitler and had made this dazzling film tribute to him. She never  worked in films again until the mid-70's when she once again began to make  documentaries.<br />The camera work in &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; is  incomparable and years ahead of its time. Riefenstahl's obvious admiration  for Hitler is patently obvious, there is an almost sexual undercurrent in  her repeated close-ups of Hitler and the tight head shots she employs  throughout the documentary.<br />Unfortunately, if you don't speak German,  much of the impact of the film will be lost, even though it remains a  riveting and dynamic visual feast. Nothing documents the barbarity of the  Nazi regime or its mesmerizing pull upon the German people better than this  documentary. This is a sobering monument to depravity and a testament to  the brilliance of Leni Riefenstahl.<br />Though the film was made in 1934,  before the world grasped the evil nature of Nazism, it is a sobeirng  portent of things to come.
0930289455|4.0|I am not a big comic book reader, but this novel looked interested and I like Batman, so I took a chance.  I'm glad I did because the story was riveting.  I don't know that much about Batman, and to be honest, the story  confused me a little, but after reading it several times, I decided the  book was a keeper.  This is a story about a man, the Joker, who commits  several senseless acts of violence in order to try and drive Batman insane.   To me this is a story about humanity and the quest to make sense out of an  often senseless world.  Read this book if you like Batman and the Joker.   Or read this book for the reason I did: You like a compelling story about a  hero in an imperfect world, a story that makes you think about who you are  and where you fit in this imperfect world.
B000006U44|2.0|Listening to this album is a real disappointing experience for me.<br />I hear a lot of songwriting talent here, and many of the songs have beautiful melodies.  The instrumentation is always tasteful and well done also.<br />So  what's wrong?  Simply, I just cannot withstand Kate's voice.  I tried...I  can't.  The song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a perfect example.  Great  songwriting.  Wonderful melody.  But she sings it like a mouse on helium.   It needs to be at least an octave and a half lower, and sung by someone  that doesn't have the annoyingly shrill qualities of Kate Bush's  voice.<br />In the end, this one factor completely kills my enjoyment of this  record.  I still have it in my collection -- but it is an example of a time  I took a chance on a new artist and came up short.
6304372329|4.0|Good Editing and great soundtrack. Action packed scenes keep you at the edge of your seat.  The characters draw you in to the film and you want to almost help them survive against the cruel situations that they have been  placed in.  The scenery is spectacular!  A must see film.
B00003XB8K|4.0|This is Enigma's best recording. The stand-out recordings are: &quot;PUSH THE LIMITS&quot;(great pulse pounding workout music),&quot;GRAVITY OF LOVE&quot;(great love song),&quot;MODERN CRUSADERS&quot;(fast/upbeat,should  have been used in the end credits of X-MEN),&quot;CAMERA  OBSCURA&quot;(FAST), &quot;SILENCE MUST BE HEARD&quot;(great song with a  supernatural sound).
6303942830|5.0|Two years ago in a my junior history class I watched this film and loved it.  I recently watched it again, and could actually sit back and enjoy it. I love this movie. It's an action movie, it's a love story, it has a heart.  Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Nathaniel, and Madeleine Stowe made her  character very realistic. They make a wonderful couple and bring a  lightness to the movie. I really enjoyed the images in the movie, it was  beautifully filmed, the moutains..the water fall...But one of things I  truly love about this movie is it's music. The score is compelling,  romantic and fast paced all at the same time. My favorite film used to be  the English Patient, but upon watching this again, I think I've changed my  mind. Honestly though, this film has something for everyone, lots of action  (my bro loved all the action scenes) romance (ah! that passionate kissing  scene!) I think that this is a very moving film, you come to feel for the  characters, to see their humaness.  Unlike more recent historical epics,  this film isn't filled with heads being chopped off (at least not in the  VHS version) every five seconds. And the lovers of this story don't have to  jump in the sack every five minutes to relate their passion to the  audience.  All in all this film is a treat. I'd recommend to anyone and  everyone who enjoys a good movie.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Before I start I would like to clear up one thing. For those of you who are saying this CD is totally different from their first and just filled with Rap, you are full of bullcrap! This CD is just like their first one!  Of course the songs are differnt, but the whole style of playing is THE  SAME!  You people are probably the same guys who claim that groups like  Rage Against the Machine and Papa Roach are rap. Now, back to the CD. If  you like Limp Bizkit you will definetly love this album. All through out  it, the tracks rule. It has the type of bass line and hard rock guitars  that just keep the whole CD rockin'. It even has some guest appearences by  Method Man, Johnathan Davis, and even Fred Durst's mom (singing &quot;My  Billy Goat&quot;). My personal favorite tracks are &quot;9 Teen 90  Nine&quot;, &quot;Nobody Like You&quot;, and &quot;Don't Go Off  Wandering&quot;. This CD rules and is a neccecity for any Hard Rock or Punk  Rock fan!
B0000027RL|5.0|This cd is incredible. It has some of the great rock anthems of the 90's. I think the song Alive is the best song of the 90's. That song has everything. Great vocals, great riff, good lyrics, and a great guitar solo.  It's the top cut from the album. Other great songs are Once, Jeremy, Even  Flow, and Black. Sorry Nirvana fans, I'm one of them, this is the best  grunge album made in the ''grunge'' era. Pearl Jam's best album. It's kinda  sad that they moved away from this style after Vitalogy, but their other  stuff is good. It's an instant classic.
0783241542|5.0|Hilarious, better than all other teen comedies or slashers or whatever released recently. See it.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Alright, let me give my honest to God opinion of this C.D.  Like I said, it's not great, but it's exceptional.  I'm really not a fan of Britney, but I am a fan of her music and her lyrics(not really her lyrics, but  whatever...) <br />1.Oops!...I did it Again: Like always, the first song in  the album is one of the best. I love the beat to the song and some of the  lyrics.<br />2. Stronger: I LOVE THE LYRICS(really sends out a positive  message) and the tune is good. However, Brit's computerized voice sounds  rather croaky.<br />3. Don't go Knocking on My Door: It's a cool song, but you  get tired of hearing it after a couple of times (atleast that's how it was  for me)<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: eh, it's alright, considering  that I never liked any of The Rolling Stones's songs.<br />5.Don't let me be  the last to Know: A beautiful ballad with powerful lyrics. This is my  favorite song in the album. And in my opinion, it's Spears's best  ballad.<br />6. What U see is What you Get: I like this song alot. It has a  great beat like Oops... and you can never get tired of dancing to  it.<br />7.Lucky: It's not a great song, but it's tolerable. The tune is  really good, though.<br />8.One Kiss from You: Many people don't seem to like  this song, I don't know why. I like it alot.  It's really sweet and  melodious. Plus, the lyrics are great.  P.S.: It does not sound like Soda  Pop, as one reviewer mentioned before.<br />9. Where are you now? This is my  second favorite song in the album. It's not only got great lyrics, but  Britney actually sings good in this one. I guess I like it so much 'cause  I'm a girl and ballads about love make me cry. J/K. But it really is a nice  ballad.<br />10. Can't make You Love me: This is another song, like &quot;What  U See is What You Get&quot;, that I like alot. The backgound music is cool  and plus, I can relate to the song alot. =)<br />11.When Your Eyes say It: I  only like the chorus, plain and simple.<br />12. Dear Diary: The lyrics are as  corny as the title. But the song's not a total loss.  Atleast you can be  assured that Britney DOES know how to write her own &quot;music&quot;   =)<br />Well, there you go. My reviews. Overall Opinion: It's a good album,  with a few flaws. Personally, I like her first album a bit more. But when  you really listen close, the songs in Oops!...I  did It Again sound alot  like the songs in ...Baby One More Time.
1570428654|4.0|I don't usually listen to books, but I bought this for an upcoming road trip.  Since so much of the book is oral, there is speech therapy, singing, attempting to speak French, it is wonderful to listen to the author's  actual voice.
0790731452|1.0|There are few things more disappointing than an unfunny comedy.<br />I didn't laugh even once during this movie.  Believe me, I tried to find humor in it, but not once did I find myslef chuckling.  I was tempted to leave, but  I kept staying in the hope that it would get better.  It never did.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is awesome 12 seconds into the first song (Sic), I knew I had made a great decision because they rock.
6303913881|1.0|... only someone emerging from total isolation in a cave somewhere, and then being shown &quot;Showgirls&quot; as the first movie they had ever seen in their life, would even consider recommending it to  someone else (and even then it'd be a stretch). Synopsis? Let's see -  horrible acting, terrible and uninteresting plot, unsympathetic characters.  In short, the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. It's a shame Amazon won't let me give  this a ZERO STAR RATING because even that is more than it deserves.
0767903854|5.0|This book is hysterical! It's like spending an evening listening to your wittiest friend tell a story. Bryson is a wonderfully entertaining writer. I personally think this book was even better than &quot;A Walk in the  Woods.&quot; I've never been particularly fascinated with Australia, but  after reading this book, I can't wait to go. I highly recommend this book -  read it!
6305508550|5.0|I recently watched this movie with a bunch of classmates and couldn't stop laughing.  It became the center for jokes in the class room  (The people to cake ratio is to small) and of course the red swingline.  <br />Milton is  awesome!  he rocks!  and horray for him being able to do what everyone  wanted to do.
B00001ODHF|5.0|I have seen Army of Darkness over 20 times and still think it is a great movie. My friends and I used to watch this movie all the time.  It's a horror movie but it's loaded with comedy.  The only thing that bothers me  about it is that the windmill scene does not make sense to me. (I'm sure it  is explained in the Director's Cut, which I have never seen). This is one  of my favorite movies of all time and I can watch it over and over.
B0000004V2|5.0|What more can be said? If yuo've read the other reviews you'll know how good an album this is!    Basically all of the tracks are classics and ones that you'll want to listen to over and over again. From the melodic  and thoughtful I Wanna be Adored to the delightfully upbeat and catchy She  Bangs the Drums and the beautifully crafted Made of Stone.  THIS IS ONE OF  THE BEST BRITISH ALBUMS EVER!  I just hope that more people in the States  will bring it upon themselves to experience a masterpiece!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I absolutely love this album as a total! There are the two songs I had no interest for though which are Dear Diary and When your eyes say it those songs don't show the musical talent that she has and are too mushy. This  album is different from her last album but is still very good. I think if  you liked her last album more than likely you will like this.one. My fave  songs on it are Lucky and Oops...Lucky has  very good lyrics and shows the  more grown up Britney while Oops keeps the Britney that we know and have  grown to love with her up beat melodies. All and all you should by this  album to hear her before you make rude judgements about her or just  because.
B000002I27|5.0|\\"Strange Days,\\" the second offering from The Doors continues their dynamic assault on sensory perception with ten songs that range from the cryptic \\"Strange Days,\\" to the wistful \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" to the guttural,  swallow-you-up classic \\"When The Music's Over.\\"  It also contains a song  (actually a poem) like no other you've ever heard on a rock n' roll album,  \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" a tormented recitation by Morrison, spoken over the  sounds of a storm at sea, really more a storm of the soul, eerily steeped  in the anguish and suffering of tortured humanity.  There's the thought  provoking \\"People Are Strange,\\" and the straight on rock of \\"Love Me Two  Times.\\"  As with all of The Doors material, the songs on this album will  take you to places rarely visited via the medium of rock music; their  lyrics and sound evoke emotions that will take you from the sublime to the  primitive.  Listen to the words and let the music penetrate your being; you  can get lost in this, and it can take you to a whole new level of  awareness, if you'll only let it.
B000002I25|5.0|This is the one that introduced The Doors, and the gifted poet/singer/songwriter Jim Morrison, their enigmatic lead singer, to the world.  At the time, it was like nothing anybody had ever heard, and to  this day their sound remains unique.  There have been many imitators over  the years, but none have come close to achieving that special quality of  sound that began here, with \\"The Doors.\\"  The album begins with \\"Break On  Through (To The Other Side),\\" and includes their monster hit (which took  them to the top of the charts, usurping the Beatles and Stones as the  number one band in America) \\"Light My Fire,\\" featuring dynamic solos by  guitarist Robby Krieger and keyboardist Ray Manzarek.  This debut album  also features one of their most controversial (and best) songs ever, \\"The  End,\\" into which Morrison interjects his (and rock n' roll's only) version  of Sophocles' play, \\"Oedipus the King,\\" through dialogue spoken over the  music; it is ethereal and hypnotic, with Morrison delivering the words from  an almost trance-like state of being.  The final cut on the album, it  underscores the fact that there is much more to The Doors than hard-edged  rock.  Also worthy of note is that it was used (and very effectively) by  director Francis Ford Coppola during the opening credits of his film,  \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"  Never before or since has anyone fused hard rock with  poetry and mixed it with the blues to create such aural and mental images  as these, and it's all delivered with an energy and intensity that can set  you free.  The lyrics are sometimes cryptic (\\"Take the highway to the end  of the night/take a journey to the bright midnight\\") and steeped in  metaphor and allegory; while the songs themselves run an emotional gamut,  from the wistfulness of \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" to the primal scream of \\"Back  Door Man.\\"  This is the first of the seven albums made by The Doors (six  studio, one live), during their all too brief career, which began in the  summer of 1965 and ended on July 3, 1971 with the death of Jim Morrison.   If you've never experienced The Doors, it's time to start; do it with this  album.  To the casual fan, I suggest you take a step back and really listen  this time, you may have missed something the first time around.  The music  of The Doors is timeless, and once it grabs hold of you, it's never going  to let you go.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Lovers of the American Songbook and traditional musicians owe Krall a huge debt for helping make all these songs viable once again.  Not only that but she swings as a pianist (even playing her own walking bass line on &quot;I  Can't Give You Anything But Love&quot;).<br />Vocally, her chops, though  limited in range and smoky in quality, are more than adequate, except when  she takes on a song requiring genuine commitment and depth.  Cole Porter's  anthem to obsessive love, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin, &quot; is  disappointing if not offensive to hear in such a desultory bossa nova  style.<br />On the other hand, hats off to her for bringing back Bob Dorough's  underrated &quot;Devil May Care&quot; and Newley's and Bricusse's lovely  &quot;When I Look into Your Eyes&quot; (originally sang by Rex Harrison to  a seal!).<br />A worthwhile addition to anyone's library, providing they  also have plenty of Nat Cole, Sinatra and, of course, Shirley Horn's  &quot;Here's to Life,&quot; the new standard against which all female vocal  albums must be measured.
B000001ELB|5.0|This KISS compolation is awesome because it shows that even before KISS got big, they were good. Even the songs that came out when they were big are awesome! The re-recorded version of &quot;Strutter&quot; is even better  than the original! &quot;Calling Dr.Love&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll All  Nite&quot; &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Strutter '78&quot; are  the best songs and the others are awesome too. This is the best KISS CD to  get if you are getting into them!
B00003W8NM|5.0|The beauty of this film is that it is at its heart a romantic comedy. Not excatly &quot;You've got Mail&quot; but not the harbinger of Gen X doom that everyone makes it out to be either. At its heart, this movie wants to  make you laugh, and it constantly hits its mark. The jokes (often darker  and darker as the film progresses) are fast and furious and the ending is  not so much the narrartor overcomming Tyler, but realising that Marla  (Love) is what makes his life worth living. The exploration of Nihlism,  buddism, anacrchism are just diverting sidebars in what should be viewed as  the funniest black comedy ever (ok there is Dr. Strangelove but what is so  funny about the end of the world?). Forget the fights (ask yourself why  they are worse than any Arnie movie... are you bothered by real, not  cartoon, violence), forget the Nihlistic rants (the &quot;Robert  Paulson&quot; chant should be enought to make you realize that groups like  this are mindless anyway) and focus on the dry pointed humor that runs  throughout as a beacon to this disaffected generation.<br />Oh and yes this  DVD is AWSOME. The extras listed are great and this is easily the best  packaged DVD I own.
B000007S5B|5.0|This third album by The Doors, \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" features a few surprises and includes some (now) historic moments from these \\"Kings of Acid Rock.\\"  In \\"Not To Touch The Earth,\\" Jim Morrison's \\"Lizard King\\"  persona emerges for the first time; at the end of the song he utters the  words, \\"I am the Lizard King, I can do anything.\\"  And the understated,  powerfully simple way he delivers the line is chilling.  In the intense  \\"Five To One,\\" we hear the phrase \\"No one here gets out alive\\" for the  first time, delivered with guttural abandon and soul-bearing honesty.   There is a yearning, dream-like quality in the mesmerizing \\"My Wild Love,\\"  that evokes the need for freedom, the desire to be released.  There's a  hypnotic, sing-song rhythm to it, accented by a chorus of clapping hands  that makes it transporting.  The stirring anti-war anthem \\"The Unknown  Soldier\\" is another gripping cut, it's message underscored by the sound of  rifle bolts being thrown, the tension of a prolonged drum roll followed by  the caesura, then the dramatic crack of the shot being fired (and it seems  somehow ironic, now, that Morrison didn't live to see the end of the  Vietnam War).  The talented Robby krieger displays his versatility by  highlighting \\"Spanish Caravan\\" with some terrific flamenco guitar.  Also  included on this album is one of their more well known songs, \\"Hello, I  Love You;\\" straight out rock n' roll.  There's the poetic \\"Yes, The River  Knows,\\" and the thoughtful \\"Summer's Almost Gone.\\"  \\"Love Street,\\"  \\"Wintertime Love,\\" and \\"We Could Be So Good Together,\\" round out the eleven  offerings of \\"Waiting For The Sun;\\" each song unique, and all classic  Doors.
B00000K19E|5.0|If you're into a movie that gives your brain a good going over, with twists and turns and amazing special FX, then The Matrix is the one for you. It boasts stars like Samuel L Jackson and Keanu Reeves, who has, I  think revived his flagging movie career with this movie. The Matrix also  sets the scene for those who are fashion conscious. The very slick costumes  and sunglasses add to the very cool, futuristic feel of the film. The dark  feel of the film, which comes through in the characters and their costumes  are continued in the awesome sountrack that accompanies the movie. (fans of  Manson and Rammstein will love the music). All in all, I found The Matrix  to be a very polished, thought provoking movie about our present and future  society and the &quot;Big Brother&quot; complex that we seem to have in  this technological age.
B000000YG5|5.0|The 20 bit K2 coding of this disc is astounding in it's rendering of Sonny in the studio as it makes it appear that he is hiding in your listening room (behind my gear rack, dead center).  It is that good.  I had my  reservations and have not compared it to the JVC XRCD package but it is  heads, hands and feet better than the original cd release.  This is  probably Sonny's best work and deserves the best mastering and premium  treatment that can be bestowed upon it.  Unlike some other premium  packages, XRCD included, the content here is equal to the sonics.  Buy this  one or the XRCD and sell your other one at Disc-go-Round or better yet give  it to a gen X or Y er and turn them on to jazz.
630018403X|5.0|Did you know that \\"social\\" problems such as being \\"picked\\" on in school are one of the top reasons for teen suicide? Yes, it is true. Students commit suicide to escape the torture of being treated unfairly. The kid who  is viewed and labeled as a dork dream of being treated like the others. The  princess of the class flaunts her beautiful necklace of real precious  stones that her parents gave to her. Others look and wish they had here  wealth and looks. The bully is feared by many, as they tremble at the  though of being humiliated by him. Many, even weird by the dork, which even  in his case does not understand him/her, view the weirdo of the class as a  reject.<br />This is somewhat of what makes the suicide rate so large for the  American Student. Harmony among the \\"labels\\" is distant if not nothing more  than a dream for many. This film indirectly tackles this issue.<br />These  five students were scheduled for detention for eight hours. A dork, kook,  criminal, jock and a princess sat in their seats for these eight hours.  There sat five students, five labels, five minds, and five personalities.  Five students, five labels, five minds, five personalities that were  totally different and clashed horribly. At first the clashing showed the  dork getting picked on, the kook getting laughed at, the jock being  challenged, the princess getting lets say getting some inappropriate  remarks by the bully. <br />Their assignment was an essay on \\"Who Am I?\\"  Through the course of the film they would come to know the answer of this  more than they ever dreamed. The clashing turned into harmony. The realized  this difference which once caused the \\"clashing\\" is what made their  friendship so strong. Amazingly they came to understand they were as  different as they were the same. They entered each other's world. They all  entered the bully world as he told of this horrid and dreadful home  situation. They even smoked his dope that they once viewed as something  they would never do. (This is a funny scene Brain in this scene will make  you rewind a few times it is so funny.) The bully entered the princes'  world as he wore the expensive diamond jewelry earring that once was the  center and target of his jokes. Their world merged as they merged into one  and the harmony they once only dreamed of came rushing in.
B0000033RY|5.0|These guys were great and just slightly ahead of their time.  Hard rock boogie blues.  The only thing close was Foghat or Savoy Brown but Cactus would have blown them off the stage.  Tim Bogart and Carmine Appice were  the rhythm section from hell and Jim McCarty plays enough licks for 2  guitarists.  This disc contains all of the first album except one slow  blues tune and the best cuts from the One Way or Another album but leaves  out some choice ditties from RESTRICTIONS, their most successful album.   The last 3 songs on this collection are filler except for possibly the live  Parchman Farm cut which gives a hint at their awesome quartet sound on  stage.  You can almost smell the reefer.  Can you say that on Amazon.com?   WEA/Atco...put all three studio albums out on polycarbonate!  My import  vinyl is getting thin.  &quot;I know for a fact it was the road house woman  that done my brother in.  They put the last clean shirt on my poor brother  bill.&quot;
1882723007|4.0|I read this book about  6 years ago and I still remember much of it. After hearing the author tell of her near death experience on &quot;Oprah,&quot; I thought I'd read the book to glean more insight. Eadie is a good writer  and the reading is brisk and easy and the book itself is not very  long.<br />While I believe the author truly believes the account of her NDE, I  find some of it contrary to some underlying principals of the Bible ... and  considering she makes several quotes from the Bible, it is  relevant.<br />Regardless of my personal feelings concerning what did and  didn't happen to the author, the book is very insightful regarding the  needs of the human spirit.<br />Her story of being a lonely, mistreated girl  on an Indian reservation was moving and heartbreaking.  To see how people  who could have had such an impact on a little child abused their role and  treated her like human garbage because of her heritage made me cringe.  Often times when we talk to children, we forget that they will one day be  adults and most likely remember every instance of our encounter with them  if it is either extremely harsh or extremely benevolent. It makes you  think... do you want to be remembered in the thoughts of others, and if so,  how?<br />Regardless of your take on the validity of her account, her  descriptions are emotional and convincing and can really change the heart  of the reader.
B00003XACV|5.0|This was definately one of the best movie scores of the year, and decade.  It was one of those that you had to buy, and could listen to and not be bored with.  Much of this is because of its untraditional orchestra and  contemporary instramentations.  The music helped make the movie powerful.   With out the score the movie would still be great, but the score just adds  something more.  It's chilling, raw, and very original, and is also a must  have.
0783219598|5.0|I was given some free passes to see this film right before it came out. I had seen the trailers, and they looked cute, but if I hadn't gotten the free passes, I might have skipped over this gem. This is far more than a  children's movie.<br />The voice of the pig is absolutely perfect... sweet,  innocent and believable. Babe's tender heart will remind you of Wilbur from  E.B. White's &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; but this is a story in its own  right... and there is no talking spider.<br />James Cromwell received an Oscar  nomination for his role as Farmer Hoggett, a sweet, somewhat hen-pecked  sheep farmer who wins the piglet as a prize in a county fair.<br />Babe is a  lonely little piglet... he's had to say goodbye to his siblings and his  mother at a tender age and is thrust into a barn with all sorts of strange  animals he's never seen before. All of the animals, dogs, horses, the cows,  etc. feel sorry for Babe and look out for him. There is rivalry with the  top Border Collie, but Babe's sweet and innocent disposition wins the  hearts of all reluctant farm dwellers.<br />The farmer's wife initially sees  Babe as just a ham on legs, but the farmer sees more and finds a friend  that changes his life.<br />It is impossible to see this film and not get at  least a lump in your throat and many scenes will make you laugh outloud. I  wish the DVD included more features, like a behind-the-scenes featurette  outlining how they got the animatronics (which won a much deserved Oscar)  to work. Perhaps it was felt that children would be dismayed that the pig  really can't talk or that it took nearly 30 pigs to make the film due to  the speed in which they grow into 1-ton hogs... I'm not sure, but as an  adult, i would have enjoyed seeing more features on the DVD. This is still  a wonderful family film and unforgettable and sweet characters.
B00004STPT|5.0|This was simply a breathtaking score, with original music as well as a theme that is relayed through out the score.  The best part of it was the incorperation of spanish, roman, and northern Sahara music, which makes the  score very cultural and realist, as opposed to the grand 'ol Hollywood Epic  score.  It is very beautiful and entrancing, and is a good purchase if you  just like good music.

B00004RFFI|4.0|The movie, while not the best script the world has ever seen, is entertaining and the visual and sound effects are terrific!   I would recommend this DVD especially in the DTS format for anyone that has DTS  capabilities...
0767802470|4.0|The only complaint I have about this DVD is that it's a flipper - the one has material on both side and you have to turn it over by hand in the middle of the movie. Otherwise it's wonderful. The picture and sound  quality are supperb, excellent re-mastering job (it's a 1981 movie!). They  made it a flipper because the cut is very long (&gt;3hrs) and has both  English and German DD5.1. I will give it 5 stars if it's not a flipper. I  hated flipper and I sweared not to buy any flipper after Amadeus. But I  bought this one as exception - showing how good this movie really is.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's self titled album is considered it's best by many Metallica fans.  I do not know if I agree with that, but I will say it is one of their greatest.  Unlike ..And Justice For All, the lengths of the songs are  reasonable.  In this album, Metallica experimented with some sounds they  had never used before.  Enter Sandman is and always will be a classic.  I  have never heard of a Metallica fan that does not love the song Enter  Sandman.  Although I do believe the best songs on the album are The  Unforgiven and Wherever I May Roam, they are tied for first place.
044022165X|5.0|This book is a bit of a departure for Grisham from  the usual part of the legal industry he uncovers.  Rudy, our hero, is drawn kicking and screaming into the shader side of the law: even ambulance chasing.  But then there's  the shady side of what seems like high-class law, the kind of sleeze in big  law firms that we saw in &quot;The Firm&quot;.  You also had to feel drawn  yourself into Rudy's world - including the world of the new lawyer trying  to make his way.  It would be unfair to tell you how it ends - let's just  say the read is worth your time as always with Grisham's excellent  storytelling.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Significant Other is unlike any other CD I own.  It is always fun to listen to.  What surprised me is that the hits on this album are not the best songs, even though they are awesome.  There are some tracks on the CD  that I couldn't believe were not hits like 11, 8, 7, and especially 2. Just  Like This is extremely catchy and it has not been played on the radio or  MTV.  It can also be found on the Big Daddy soundtrack.  Trust? is probably  the loudest song on the album. My favorite song on the album is Rearranged.  It took me awhile to like Rearranged, but after I listened to it a couple  times it was my favorite song!  I cannot believe that Limp Bizkit aren't on  MTV's The Return of Rock.  Trust? would be the perfect song for Limp Bizkit  to put on it.
0440213525|5.0|Do you believe that in our society a story whose main characters are a 50+ attorney and her 11 year old client would become a best seller and a TV show?  I couldn't be more thrilled.  Of course, the book had to be good for  this to happen and it is. You become a part of the lives of these two  characters, worrying with them page per page about what will happen next.  The plot twists and turns and leaves you with a satisfying ending just when  you think it's not possible.  Well worth your time!
0380973464|5.0|I started reading this book, and about 3 pages in I thought, Man, this guy can write! Great pacing, fully developed characters, wonderful humor.  Good stuff.  I've gone on the read SNOW CRASH, and I'll be looking for more from  Mr. Stephenson. Great work.
0440234743|5.0|Actually would have liked to give this 4.5 but it's not on the list.  Only a bit off the usual storytelling of Grisham.  So often he takes you  inside the legal world of many shades. Here he takes you into shaded tropical  jungles as well. The contrast between the two worlds is compelling,  especially Grisham's sensitivity to the plight of the native population.  Descriptions are quite fine, story-line is great but could have been  shortened, I think. I think characterizarion could have been stronger -  more on some of the peripheral characters and one the reluctant heiress to  keep interest - you do get a bit tired of our jungle travelling, alcoholic  as the only big character. However, as the first Grisham I read (and I have  read five others now to compare this to) it was fine enough to send me  hurrying to Amazon to buy everything else he ever wrote!
0792837622|5.0|I first saw this movie because I was the only one in my Year 7 class that hadn't seen it.There was a certain ''revival'' for WEST SIDE STORY in 7x following a crush that a friend of mine had had on GEORGE CHAKIRIS whom she had seen in the movie not long ago.Being a 12-year-old FRIENDS fan I wasn't  expecting much of a 39-year-old musical,but I gave in and persuaded my  mother to let me rent it from the video shop. From the opening scene I was  hooked.The musical quality of the movie impressed me greatly as did the  actors,actresses and settings.The New York slums came alive for me and I  could picture the Jets and the Sharks in my mind as if they were there with  me.I was impressed also by the acting,as I mentioned,but was a little  disappointed by NATALIE WOOD'S performance.She didn't seem right for the  part of Maria,and I was dubious about her actual talent,but the others like  RUSS TAMBLYN and RICHARD BEYMER made up for it.All in all a superb  film....even better than TITANIC!
0440214041|5.0|My husband cannot understand why I prefer to read a book before I see the movie because it's such fun to see what they leave in, what they take out, how they cast the characters, etc.  But I didn't have the opportunity to do  so with this book. It was the wonderful movie with Denzell Washington and  Julia Roberts which sent me looking for Grisham's books.  I've been reading  them in the order in which he wrote them and have found them all wonderful.   The Pelican Brief exhibits very well something I often find in Grisham's  work - the expert unfolding of the story and of the details about the  characters' lives.  This book, in particular, has a complex plot and a  secret long-held within the pages of the book (and as well in the movie)  that keeps you spell-bound.  I found both main characters to be interesting  and I kept wanting to know more about how they thought and how they ticked  as they tried to save their lives. Read the book first and then see the  movie!
B00003CXDV|4.0|The movie worths for the comic scenes, Sigourney Weaver's blond hair, the great special effects and the sound quality. Packed full of extras and a special audio track, in Thermian language (which is always good to show to  your friends), gives the final touch for this DVD, that should be part of  your home collection.
078322818X|5.0|Where were you in '62?<br />AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a classic from George Lucas, made before STAR WARS it's a warm tale of a group of friends on their last night before they go their separate ways: to University, work, etc.<br />This  movie was a roaring success, and it's not hard to see why. The story's many  plot strands work well despite their apparent non-connection to each other.  The characters are richly acted and written, providing for some memorable  comic moments. By contrast, the serious moments of thinking about the  future are handled well with believability making them all the more  powerful.<br />The ending (I'm giving nothing away) also manages to pack a  punch. This is the type of movie you'll sit around reminiscing about for  weeks after you've seen it. A classic.
0790743132|5.0|Here's a dumb review: how could you not already know how incredibly perfect this movie is?  Why are you still reading this?  Go watch Casablanca!  Now, go watch it again!  And again!  I sure have: I'm over  thirty viewings now, and life is too short to waste time reading something  so obvious as this review.  Go watch Casablanca! If you're still here,  thanks for listening.  In case you haven't figured it out, it's my favorite  movie.  It's my mother's favorite movie.  It's my wife's favorite movie.   It's my best friend's favorite movie.  Heck, I've even ended a friendship  with someone who said they hated this movie; anybody with taste that bad  can't be a good person to have as a friend.  Go watch it with someone you  love -- even better, go watch it with someone you'd like to love you.   Trust me.  It works.
6302662648|5.0|Ever thought the Government know our every move?<br />SNEAKERS won't try to change your mind. This is a fantastic cast (Redford, Poitier, Aykroyd, Phoenix) with an equally witty, sharp and tense script. The story revolves  around this team of conspiracy theorists on a retrieval mission of the  ultimate password decoder: lethal in anybody's hands.<br />There are some very  suspensful moments here, some great comedy (particularly Aykroyd's  character who thinks everything is a Government cover-up or conspiracy).  Even if technology and hacking doesn't interest you, don't worry. This is a  stylish adventure in the best tradition: one worth more than a single  viewing.
B0000024VP|5.0|Psychedelic Rock! Yes kiddies, this is one, even though it seems like a Keltic/folk rock/pop album.<br />During the First Psychedelic Era, 1966, Donovan's laid back, happy, Summerland masterpiece was used to relax and  calm down people whose heads had gotten into bad places due to bad  influences. It still works for stress. It continues to be suitable (mostly)  for the whole family. Donovan chose to express his ideas through 19 century  Romantic, poetic images (mostly, except &quot;the Trip&quot;). What other  images are there have been woven into the dream, you may not know they are  there if you don't know where to look. <br />Pleasant, Contemplative, Exotic  beauty from end to end. The rejected Sunshine hero of the title track who  is sure his girlfriend will want him back, a girl with her hair caught in a  Ferris Wheel, diving kingfishers, the cold wind in the Season of the Witch.  Yes, &quot;Fat Angel&quot; was written to Mama Cass and mentions the  Jefferson Airplane, then an unknown/alternative/underground/ rock group.  People need to avoid coffee and other stimulants and relax more! In  &quot;The Trip&quot; Donovan tells us &quot;the seagull says, as I look to  way out then,/ 'the whole wide human race is taking far too much  methadrine!'&quot;. It was true in '66, it's even more true now! <br />Note:  Dylan's music was thought to be preachy. &quot;Blowin in the Wind&quot; and  &quot;Hard Rain's a gonna fall&quot; made the politically correct liberals  feel self-righteous and sactimonious, but Donovan wasn't Dylan. Donovan was  entertainment! You can't fault a giraffe for not being a pig. <br /> Not a bad  song. Donovan's masterpiece.
0790731231|5.0|This is a classic movie.<br />GOODFELLAS takes the story of Henry Hill, who went from being a petty criminal to a mob member amongst violent gangsters (Joe Pesci's turn as a merciless killer is shocking but brilliant). It's a  fluid story, from the 1950's to near the end of the century, telling us all  the interesting, violent and criminal things that happened in  between.<br />Great acting and a first rate script make GOODFELLAS a contender  for Scorcese's best movie so far. DeNiro is also on fine form as Jimmy  Conway, a seemingly 'pleasant' gangster who ends up becoming Hill's worst  enemy.<br />If you have any interest in the gangster genre whatsoever, you  will want to check out this contender for title of &quot;Best of  Genre&quot; as quickly as you can.
B00004S6GL|5.0|This is a great disc from Elliott Smith...I was skeptical when I heard the first couple of tracks, but it really is a great compilation of songs.  Although Son of Sam is getting some air-play and is perhaps the most  well-known song on the album right now, I think other tracks like Easy Way  Out, Happiness, and I Better Be Quiet Now are very strong as well.   Although in my opinion none of the new songs can match Waltz #2 (my  personal fave), this is definitely an album worth buying.
6302794331|4.0|Thankfully, the Muppets only adapted famous novels here and in MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, before going back to telling orignal stories. However, the idea (which was fresh with MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL) to convert a famous  novel to the zany humour and wacky acting of the Muppets reaps dividens in  this movie.<br />Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit: put-upon employee of  cold-hearted Ebenezer Scrooge. When Scrooge is visited by three ghosts (you  know the story!) Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat provide superb narration that  suprises by being both incredibly funny and spanning several types of  humour: adult, farce, parody and more.<br />The keyword in the Muppet movies  is entertainment. This is obviously not even worth comparing to the  Alastair Sim SCROOGE or even Bill Murray's gem SCROOGED. It's the Muppets  telling a story as they want to tell it: in their own magical way.

0783235968|4.0|In FIELD OF DREAMS, a man believes it to be his destiny to build a baseball field on his farm when he starts hearing voices. Everyone else doubts him, but he perseveres. Kevin Costner is on potentially his best  form as the man with a heartfelt mission to do what he wants to, not what  everyone else wants him to.<br />A pleasing soundtrack adds to quality of this  movie, and the struggles of Costner and his screen family to keep the farm  from bankruptcy whilst a dream is followed is a lesson for us all in doing  what we think is right.<br />Little is explained for the reason he was chosen,  or why the team chose that cornfield to appear on. Perhaps this is part of  the glory of FIELD OF DREAMS: it just wants to tell a story that will make  you feel good, not deliver a physics argument on the reality of ghosts.
6301697707|3.0|In TREMORS, a small desert town is attacked by huge man-eating, destructive 'worms', and two cowboys - Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon - set out to stop them. That's the premise: no explanation for the worms' arrival, no  elaboration.<br />And this works. TREMORS is not a horror movie: it's not even  scary. Sure, some moments make your heart beat a little faster, such as  when the guys are being chased across land by the worms. But TREMORS  doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't take it seriously  either.<br />A few of the jokes fall flat, but on the whole TREMORS is an  amusing, quirky comedy that's been overlooked.

B0000048V8|5.0|The little boy in this lovely tale so perfectly  represents kids in that great age of wonder and imagination where everything is possible; every dream and every adventure. When I first saw The Snowman (some 18 years  ago!), it left me with such a heart warming impression that even to this  day every time I watch the film, I become that little girl who was so taken  in awe and admiration after the first viewing of the film. This film is a  great family movie where both kids and adults will enjoy its beautiful  tale, and a holiday must. I especially recommand it to all of us who are  still a kid at heart and are eager to recapture a little of bit of that  sense of childhood magic and wonder- amid the chaotic world of being a  grown up!
0451197968|4.0|It is once again the future, as seen from the early Reagan Years, and life in the United States stinks.  Children of five years old die of lung cancer because of the air pollution.  There's enough war to keep things stirred  up, but not enough to keep everyone employed.  If the government has a plan  to solve the nation's problems, we don't hear about it.  We only see their  plan to keep the people in place:  television.<br />Ben Richards, formerly  employed by General Atomics, is unemployed and desperate.  His daughter is  deathly ill and his wife has to sneak out and turn tricks to care for her.  Even so, the medicine she can buy is all but useless.  It takes serious  money to get anything approaching real medical attention, and Ben's  unemployment precludes any hope for cash or insurance.  Finally convinced  that there's no other chance, he tries to get on a game show -- they're a  staple of the massive military-industrial-entertainment complex's  television agenda.  Their pay is decent and the mortality rate isn't too  high.<br />For better or for worse, Richards manages to end up on &quot;The  Running Man.&quot; It's the network's highest rated show.  If Richards can  elude capture for thirty days, hiding wherever he can in regulated and  totalitarian America, he'll win big.  If not, he's dead.<br />The book's mood  is bleak.  Ben Richards is not a lone hero fighting for change in a corrupt  society.  He is an angry young man who wants to take care of his family in  a world that seems to be conspiring to make that impossible.  If there is  any hope for this future America, it is not mentioned.  At best, there is  hope for Richard's daughter, and that seems like an unlikely prospect.  Every character in this book is either corrupt or desperate.  It is a dark,  gritty future, and the reader can easily be pulled in.<br />The name on the  cover, &quot;Richard Bachman&quot; is Stephen King's pen name, under which  he published a few books in the early eighties.  This book, along with his  other futuristic Bachman book, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; make me wonder why  he abandoned the future has since stuck with the present and the past. The  Running Man is short and intense, and is one of the less self-indulgent of  King's revenge stories.

'rio's lyrics come from reading 2 much italian vogue, the version of 'my  own way' is slower than the 12&quot; single/video version, which makes this  1 sound kinda clunky but not w/o its charm, 'lonely in your nightmare' and  'last chance on the stairway' show the people what this group is: a younger  roxy music, full of mystery, romance, with more vogueishness to them. the  hits-'save a prayer' (containing the immortal pickup line &quot;some people  call it a one night stand/but we can call it paradise&quot;) and 'hungry  like the wolf' (slightly different than the single/video version) are what  blew this puppy up and gave us the videos that have been etched in our  minds 4ever-and they are still very beautiful videos, especially in this  age of computer generation. maybe that's another beauty of this  album-there's not much falseness in the musicianship, cause say about them  what u will, but u listen 2 the per4mance aspect of this and 4 the  songhooks and u hear and see them in another different way. although it's  hard 2 tell what simon lebon was singing about, there is absolutely no  filler on this album-and let's hope that in the future there's no 'reissue  with 8 extra cuts'. only about 45 minutes long and it should be left as  such. also at times a strange album- odder than u would expect. but it only  adds 2 the ambience.
B0000057C5|5.0|I discovered Rammstein on radio when I were in Bavaria. Their music is wonderful. If you have the album 'Live', 'Sehnsucht' isn't essential, excepted if you are a fan like me. On this album, some songs aren't  released on 'Live', like 'Alter Mann', which is a beautifull song. Very  good album like the other one.
B000023VR6|4.0|Well i guess you were all wondering where Dr. Dre had gone....well that's what he thought anyway basing most of his album on reassuring us that he is actually back in the mix. Very strong album with alot of guest appearances  - quite a few by his up and coming talents (eminem, xibit...) and with the  new NWA album soon to be released it looks like it's not all we're going to  hear about Dre.
B00004T37H|2.0|Let's face it:  animé, like sushi, is an acquired taste.  I went to see this one because it drew solid reviews in the U.S., and because I happen to believe that all good films have certain storytelling elements in common,  regardless of genre:  strong characters, a well-crafted story, and pace, to  name a few.  PRINCESS MONONOKE nails the first one, falls short on the  second, and fails miserably on the third.<br />Let's start with the good  things:  first of all, the animation is beautiful.  Every hand-painted  frame of this film is clearly the work of an artist and a perfectionist.   Three of the main characters form an intriguing psychological triangle--the  young, heroic Ashitaka, the mysterious San (who is also the title  character), and the icy Lady Eboshi.  Early on, the quality of the artwork  and the appeal of the personalities involved fooled me into thinking that I  was watching a great adventure film.<br />Then the story went on.  And on.   And on.  I must have memorized every distinguishing mark on my watch from  checking it so many times.  Look, I don't mind an intricate storyline; I  happen to be a big fan of gratifyingly complex plots.  But a GOOD complex  plot has craft, coherence, and shape; it also has a clear sense of where  it's going, and it doesn't bore you to death as it's trying to get there.   PRINCESS MONONOKE isn't content with 90 minutes' worth of material; no,  anything less than epic scale would be unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it's  so heavy-handed and self-indulgent, so lacking in any sense of narrative  structure, that it feels remarkably turgid and unenergetic despite the  large helpings of action and violence.<br />Visually inventive?  Yes.   Wondrous to behold?  Without a doubt.  Da Vinci himself could have painted  every landscape in this film and it still would have been a bloody mess.   It has no pace.  It has no subtlety.  It has no restraint.  It has none of  the qualities necessary to take a well-animated epic and turn itinto a  truly great--no, that's aiming too high--an even remotely satisfactory  experience.  Note to the multitude of diehard animé fans who will no doubt  be infuriated by my lack of respect for this \\"masterpiece\\":  I may not be  crazy about the genre, but I believe that it's just like any other  genre--capable of great things, so long as a little economy is applied.  I  would rather sit through a fifteen-hour \\"Sailor Moon\\" marathon than watch  PRINCESS MONONOKE again.
6305971293|2.0|&quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; is a fair film. It was good the first time I watched it, but it the other times I watched it, it was boring! That is the reason it gets 2 Stars is for a low  re-watchability factor! The film itself is a great contiuation from  &quot;Halloween 4: TRoMM&quot; where this film picks up one year later  after &quot;Halloween 4&quot; where Michael (Donald L. Shanks) has been  rehabilitated by a hermit in the woods and comes back to Haddonfield, once  again after his little niece Jamie (Danielle Harris). Contains - Gory  Violence, Language, and Adult Situations. DVD - 4/5 - Good DVD with the  works! Good treatment DVD wise to a forgotten sequel. If only Anchor Bay  could've done the same to &quot;Halloween 4&quot;.
B000002KE2|4.0|THE BAND: Tony Iommi (guitars), Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Geezer Butler (bass), Bill Ward (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1972) 10 songs clocking in at approximately 43 minutes. The Warner Bros issue has 2-pages of liner notes and no artwork to speak of (basically the cover artwork and song titles inside). The remastered version is now considered an import from Castle Communications (1996)... this one has the digitally remastered sound from the original master tapes, as well as the \\"faithfully restored artwork\\" - 10 pages including all band photos that the original vinyl had, song credits and lyrics. I got lucky and found a used copy of the remastered version for a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />COMMENTS: While maybe not their strongest effort in many a critic's mind, this is STILL one of my all-time favorites from Black Sabbath. Tony Iommi's muffled and distorted guitar(s) are in rare form on this album... almost a constant electric buzz (except for one heartfelt acoustical masterpiece that is probably Iommi's best ballad to date - \\"Laguna Sunrise\\"). \\"Vol. 4\\" was original titled \\"Snowblind\\"... due to the obvious reference to cocaine it was considered an unsuitable album title by Warner Bros.  The songs that opened my eyes to Sabbath were \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Supernaut\\", the 8 minute \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" and \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\" (the first hit released from the album). These stand out among the others and are hard rocking Sabbath classics. \\"Cornucopia\\" and \\"Under The Sun\\" are underrated deep album rockers. The music seems varied, complex, and open to a little experimentation - much more so than on previous Sabbath albums. Sabbath's debut (1970), \\"Paranoid\\" (1970) and \\"Masters Of Reality\\" (1971) were equally brilliant early metal classics... and \\"Vol.4\\" showed a different side to the band. That's why I fell in love with this album... it was just a tad different than anything we'd heard before from Ozzy & Co. Great disc (4.5 stars).
6305137293|3.0|&quot;Halloween II&quot; is the 2nd Best of the series (&quot;Halloween&quot; being the best!) This is a great continuation to &quot;Halloween&quot;! Picking up where the original left off ... Laurie is  rushed to the hospital for stab wounds. While, Dr.Loomis chases after  Michael following in a trail of carnage across Haddonfield. But once Laurie  is hospitalized, Michael performs some un-authorized surgery on the staff  trying to get to her! Contains - Gory Violence, Language, and Nudity. DVD -  3/5 ... could've used Full-Frame capabilities, and some more bonus options.  (Comes with: Production Notes)
B000005ALN|5.0|A very different George Michael From his Wham days.  This album definitely demonstrates the versatility  and talent of  George Michael as an artist.  His music in this Album does not adhere to any boundaries which is what  makes it so special...one of my favorite tracks is &quot;strangest  thing&quot;  just listen to the words and the melody and you too will be  captivated.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I suppose Americans needed a 'feel-good' movie about themselves.  Unfortunately this created an isolation for viewers not in the U.S.  <br />If you can get past the really silly notions of a stripper saving the First  Lady, a Macintosh saving the world, and sheesh, Judd Hirsh, it is a fairly  descent no-brainer action film.  <br />A good time waster, but nothing more.   The DVD seems fantastic for fans of this film though.  My rating is on the  sillyness of the film, not the DVD because it's a pretty nice package and  deserves a five for that.
B00000K0DT|5.0|If you snooze you lose. I know it's a bad saying, but it's good advise to use before watching `The Usual Suspects'. Although it's almost impossible to fall asleep during this film, if you do it's not worth trying to  recuperate. There is so much information crammed into two hours of film,  one minute of not paying attention will require at least ten minutes of  explanation. <br />The film begins with the ending when a cargo ship, docked  in the New York City harbor, blows up. Behind a clump of boating equipment,  we see a scared Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), watching a man in black kill  Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), blow up the ship, and then walk away. Now the  plot is set. Through the police questioning of Mr. Kint, done by inspector  Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), we go back to before the ship's land siege,  finding out about a  police line-up, and the mysterious man in black named  Kayser Soze.  <br />Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete  Postlethwaite, Stephen Baldwin, Garbriel Byrne, and others, along with a  brilliantly written screenplay, make The Usual Suspects one of the best  thrillers and most unpredictable films of all time. I bet you can't watch  it only once.
B000006YTN|5.0|It is hard to imagine this record was done by teenagers. The bassist was only 16 at the time! These kids must have been geniuses. Considering the lyrics it's even harder to imagine. Kids shouldn't right stuff like &quot;I  give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth&quot;, it's too sexist.  Fun, though, and written with a glimpse in the eye.<br />I'm not very fond of  Free in particular, but this record has some great songs. Wild Indian Woman  is my favorite, with its funky driving beat. I also enjoy the bluesy  Moonshine. Mover is great and also have those funny sexist lyrics. This is  an album David Coverdale would have been proud of.
630512762X|4.0|I saw this in the theater when it was first released and then again last night on DVD.  This is a great thriller that you've gotta see.  Yes, it's action-packed and the body count is pretty high.  Woo wows the audience  with some really artful scenes:  Cage walking down the tarmac in all his  glory, Cage and Travolta facing off (uh, get it?) with the mirrors, the  little church with the doves.  Oh yeah, there's lots of gun fights and  explosions and stuff.   <br />Face/Off isn't even a double entendre.  It's at  least a triple.  And very clever.  Get over the ridiculous surgery thing.   You'll still be wowed by the performances by Cage and Travolta as they  believably master dual roles.  Good transforms into evil; evil transforms  into good.  <br />So why does this get a \\"4\\" and not a \\"5\\"?  The sound on this  disc is great, but lack of extras is disappointing.  (If it matters, the  sound more than makes up for the lack of extras.)  I think the writers  tried to appease the female demographic by adding some sappy relationship  stuff - the film could have done without it.  But I guess the #1 reason I  didn't give it top ratings is that I couldn't get over how \\"stupid\\" Sean  Archer's staff (and wife and daughter) suddenly became when Sean no longer  acted like Sean.  Hello folks - did you check your brains at the door?   Don't let that stop you from seeing this flick.  The \\"good\\" far outweighs  the \\"bad\\".  Just acknowledging that the plot isn't bulletproof.
6304994540|5.0|Don't worry about the plot of this movie too much when you first see it.  You'll miss some of the best dialogue and subtly sublime humor in any movie, ever.<br />The minor characters truly add to this movie- Bunny's first  scene had me searching for an ATM and Jesus warrants at least two rewinds  himself- but the bread and butter is The Dude, played beautifully by Jeff  Bridges.  The Dude is a 60s-esque stoner/slacker whose most brilliant  dialogue happens when he is most confused.  His response to a nasty threat  from Jesus:  &quot;Well that's, like... your opinion, man.&quot;  Or when  confronted with a glimpse of an older man's tears:   &quot;Bummer.&quot;<br />This is an offbeat movie with as much comic depth as  any movie I've seen.  If you enjoy films like Fargo, Pulp Fiction, or  Reservoir Dogs, this is one to own!
0380729407|5.0|If you are not in the right mood to read a book then do not read it.  If you are not prepared to think then do not try.  I am writing this to you, Mr. Tulsa, OK.  You are an idiot.  &quot;I would have enjoyed this book  more if I had been in the right mood for it.&quot;  How pathetic can you  be?  The philosophy implemented by Mr. Bradbury, amongst the text, reveals  the author's ideals and thoughts.  That remains as a standard for most  novels, short stories, novellas, and the like.  If you take out the  philosophy then you haven't a story.  And please, do not try to read  anymore because I don't want you to do it.
6302642256|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Brilliantly imaginative, well-written, performed, directed. &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; is one of those movies that represents my generation's childhood (with the likes of E.T.),  and the fantasy, imagination, and wonder that was so prevalent in the  1980's and seems somehow lost today.<br />This movie is a teasure from a  recent but gone era. It's a kid's movie, and an adult's movie. It's a movie  for everyone - now and forever.<br />And the soundtrack is stunning as well.  This movie needs to be released again on VHS and DVD. Perhaps someone will  read our reviews who can help.
B000002A3T|4.0|Pink Floyd's latest album is a great one, but cannot measure up to Floyd's masterpieces of the 60's and 70's.  It is unfortunate for this album that Pink Floyd has created so many incredible works of strange and beautiful  music, because standing alone it would have been prasied as a triumph, yet  from Floyd it seems that the critics, as well as some fans, cannot accept  anything short of groundbreaking.  While it lacks the brilliant concepts of  past Floyd albums, The Division Bell is full of genuineley fabulous tunes.   &quot;What do You Want From Me&quot; is an awesome tune, &quot;Poles  Apart&quot; is the closest anything could come to the subtle magic of Dark  Side. Despite the cheap shot at Waters, the last line of lyrics is almost  friendly, more sad than vicious. Hint, the keyboard part is reminiscent of  the golden days.  &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot; is a hauntingly  beautiful song, and &quot;High Hopes&quot;, if not Gilmour's best guitar  work since Wish You Were Here, it is a fine example of his writing skills.   In conlcusion, I feel a sympathy for this album. Recieving status as a  dissapointment in the realm of Pink Floyd Magnificence, It would have been  a triumph had it been done by any other band.
B00000099Y|5.0|As soon as I heard &quot;H&quot; on the radio, I knew I had to get this record.  It was my first TOOL CD and I was absolutely blown away by the power of the music.  It seems as if every note, every stange, synthesized  sound was carefully manipulated to perfection.<br />Before you even hear the  music, you can see just how dedicated TOOL is to every aspect of their art.   The 3D-like album cover is pretty cool.  I especially like the picture  underneath the CD.  It shows the United States with California breaking off  and falling into the Pacific (this is what the song Aenima is about, I  think).  Some may be offended by the picture of the man giving himself oral  pleasure, but you can always just tear it out and focus on the music.<br />The  first song you hear is the first single &quot;Stinkfist.&quot;  Like many  of the songs on the album, it starts off soft and melodic and then  explodes.  There are a few pieces of filler material on hear.  There's a  German recipe for eggs, etc.<br />As far as the actual songs go, there is not  one weak one in the bunch.  The longest songs are probably the best.  Songs  like &quot;Eulogy,&quot; &quot;Pushit,&quot; and &quot;Third Eye&quot; will  astonish you with their brilliance.  The drumwork is incredible, perhaps  better than Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains.  The blistering solos will send  chills up and down your spine.<br />It may take one or two listens to dig  this, but you will.  Simply put: BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!
0446677450|1.0|This book has some valuable and interesting tips for the financially savvy. Unfortunately, the book presents itself as a guidebook for beginners, and in inexperienced hands, this advice may spell financial  disaster for those who need the most help.<br />Example: Kiyosaki encourages  risky investments over more stable but less profitable investments. This  might be good advice for those with an already diverse portfolio, but  considering that the vast majority of people are not adequately preparing  for their retirement years, this advice might be the worst possible.<br />The  rich dad/poor dad story that everyone else seems to find so charming  repelled me--Kiyosaki seems in need of therapy to resolve his childhood  issues. He encourages the reader to not let money have too much power, but  then he has clearly made it the governing influence of his entire  life.<br />Sadly, the biggest weakness of this book is that Kiyosaki never  conveys WHY the acquisition of money is so important to him, or should be  to us. He doesn't know what it means to feel pride in one's work, or to  love one's job. He also doesn't seem to know what it means to enjoy life as  opposed to enjoying money.
0306801515|3.0|Let me start by saying I did not voluntarily purchase this text.  I had to read it cover to cover for my &quot;Solid Mechanics and Design&quot; course.<br />This book is filled with many interesting aectdotes from the  author's experiences.  It is written in a casual way, which I like.  Most  textbooks I had overcomplicate everything!  This book covers a broad range  of topics without going into any of them too deeply.<br />The problem is that  I found it lacked the detail I needed to actually &quot;use&quot; it.   There's no math.  This makes it great for the layman, but what layman would  be interested in reading about Civil Engineering?  It provided decent base  knowledge, but when it was test time, I found it completely useless.  The  author repeatedly suggests out-of the-box thinking, which is good, but  doesn't really help.  He'll talk about birds and say &quot;aeronautical  engineers take note.&quot;  Thanks a lot.<br />Buy this if you are passionate  about science and engineering or are a middle school or high school  student.  Don't buy this if you're looking for help in college or your  career.
B00000DFKF|5.0|Ok, lets set my opnions before i review the album. I love MayheM, Euronymous is true a Black Metal god, and i hate varg for killing him, but i love burzum too, great music, very pure Black Metal. okey doke, now that  that's out of the way, on to the album. well i decided to get this album  because i wanted to hear some burzum, even though i dont like varg, and i  wasnt disapointed at all. Varg is a very good song writer and he pulls off  the One-Man-Band thing very well. theres a cuple of synth tracks and there  good in there own way. the metal songs are very good. i especially liked  &quot;War&quot; (does he say &quot;This is.....wow&quot;?) this is highly  recommeded along with Mayhem - De Mystris Dom Sathanas, Bathory - Under the  sign of the black mark, Just about any venom album, Emperor - In The  Nightside Eclipse, any Darkthrone especially &quot;A Blaze in the northern  sky&quot; and &quot;Translyvanian Hunger&quot;
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is truly amazing. From the opening chords of &quot;Around The World,&quot; to the finishing strums of &quot;Road Trippin'&quot;, Californication is a non stop experience in rock.<br />The most outstanding  track by far is the title track. In my interpretation,  &quot;Californication&quot; is the slow deterioration of everyday life into  a phony, &quot;California&quot; lifestyle, though there are hundreds of  other interpretations. The song is pure art from overture to finale. I'm  glad the group finally decided to announce it to the whole world through  single. All of the other singles, &quot;Around The World,&quot; &quot;Scar  Tissue,&quot; and &quot;Otherside,&quot; are also exceptional  works.<br />&quot;Parallel Universe,&quot; &quot;Emit Remmus,&quot; and  &quot;This Velvet Glove&quot; are also great sleeper favorites of mine.  These three songs made me glad I bought this CD after almost a year of  hearing only the singles on the radio. It's a testament to the greatness of  the album that it remains in the Amazon Top 15 sellers after over a year.  It really is that good.<br />Bottom line, if you're a rock fan, you won't be  disappointed with &quot;Californication.&quot; It's a must for RHCP fans as  a defining album along the line of Tull's &quot;Aqualung&quot; and Floyd's  &quot;The Wall.&quot;
078324228X|5.0|I loved this movie. I don't know how much of it is true, but it was well done and very moving. I'm going to buy the DVD right now! <br />If any of it was even half true, the Ruben Carter has every right to be angry. I'm a  pretty angry individual and my life wasn't even a tenth of one percent that  bad.
B00003CX59|4.0|This movie is not a literal reading of Washington Irving's story, and only the most naive moviegoers would expect it to be.  What it actually is, is a very clever update of the classic Hammer horror film formula.<br />Hammer  Film Productions produced excellently creepy British horror films in the  late 50s, 60s and 70s, most of them involving Christopher Lee and Peter  Cushing (or occasionally Vincent Price) and truckloads of actresses stuffed  into &quot;buxom wench&quot; costumes.  The Hammer formula was to take a  well known story - usually something by Edgar Allen Poe - load it up with  sex, gore, bosoms, and weird plotlines - and let it loose.<br />The presence  of the venerable Mr. Lee himself at the beginning of this movie is a dead  giveaway; this is Tim Burton's tribute to the classic Hammer Horror films.  As such you're not meant to take it too seriously.  Like the original  Hammer horror movies it emulates, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is strictly for  entertainment.  Slightly gruesome entertainment, yes, but since when have  horror movies been tasteful?  And bear in mind the Hammer films were also  criticized for the heapin' helpin' of gore they provided as  well.<br />However, Burton goes Hammer one better by giving us a complex  storyline that would be well-suited to a detective movie, with suspicion  swirling around everyone.  Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is  delightful.  His Ichabod Crane is always balancing between wanting to fall  over in a faint at the horrors he sees and wanting to investigate the weird  happenings he comes across in Sleepy Hollow.<br />I never thought to use the  words &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;Miranda Richardson&quot; in the same  sentence, but it happens here.  Christina Ricci has been criticized in  other reviews for giving a subdued performance, but her primary purpose in  this movie is to look sweet (which she does) and fill out a corset and some  low-cut gowns (which she also does to perfection).  In short, she plays the  same type of role as Hazel Court used to in the Hammer Horror films this  movie recalls.  That doesn't require acting skills so much as it does a  soulful gaze and major cleavage, both of which Ricci has in abundance.<br />To sum up, this movie is a lot of fun, and should not be taken terribly  seriously.  Burton does manage to throw a few barbs at fundamentalist  Christianity, and at times he seems to have a definite sympathy for what  appears to be a version of Wicca that some of the characters practice.  However, this is really nothing to get riled about; once again, refer to  the Hammer Horror precedents for this movie (The Curse of Frankenstein, The  Horror of Dracula, etc.) or The Wicker Man (another Christopher Lee film)  for a similar sideways look at Christianity, twenty to thirty years  earlier.<br />This movie works as both a suspense flick and a respectful but  tongue-in-cheek tip of the hat to Hammer Film Productions.  I thoroughly  enjoyed this movie.  If you want a good evening of horror film fun, rent  this, Vincent Price's &quot;The Fall Of The House Of Usher,&quot; and  &quot;Horror of Dracula,&quot; and have yourself an evening of 19th century  horrorifics.  You'll be glad you did., she plays the  same type of role as Hazel Court used to in the Hammer Horror films this  movie recalls.

B0000025H4|5.0|Enough can't be said about this one. The only live metal recording of ever that comes close to this one is Riot Live ( if you can get it or still have it). For as dated as it is, the crowd is out until your'e supposed here  them. A very very clean recording of Judas Priest in Japan stil rocks my  turntable and cd and thumps my neighbor's walls ( 1/2 acre away ) after  many years. Rob Halford burns &quot; victom of changes &quot; into your'  soul and KK school-girls all the glitter, poser guitarists that hit the  radio from that time forward. This a recording of the true pureism of rock,  the way it supposed to be.
6303149200|4.0|Luckily, I found a barely-used copy of the 101 minute version for five bucks when a video store went out of business. I enjoyed the idea of the movie so much I had a librarian track down the novel (a must read if you  like the flick).<br />That said, let's be honest with ourselves here: the film  itself does look ameturishly made, and I don't see where all of the blame  can be placed on the mindless re-editing done by those who didn't actually  make the film (find a copy of CINEFANTASTIQUE, Vol. 6, #3, for the story).  The actors give their all to the script, which Christopher Lee called the  best one he'd ever read (not saying much, judging by most of Hammer's  output...but I like and respect Mr. Lee VERY much).  But even the longest  existing version remains distractingly flawed; no matter what version you  see, the accusations of inept execution are well-deserved (how else do you  explain the cameraman's foot? Don't play dumb--YOU KNOW which scene I'm  talking about! NO WAY post-release editing caused THAT!)  <br />But hey, if  you're willing to overlook all that, the movie is as thought-provoking as  they come.<br />One last, minor point--over the years I've found pagans of all  stripes who rally around this movie despite Lord Summerisle's admission  that the island's entire pagan culture--despite his own devotion to and  defense of it--is a SHAM invented by his grandfather for sheerly commercial  purposes. Not jerkin' any chains...just wanted to point that out.<br />So  Wicker Man ain't the best movie one might watch (what is?). But it's worth  seeing at least once...and I'm a fundamentalist Christian well to the right  of Sgt. Howie! Hey, put those torches down, y'all...
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well I think you either love or hate Britney. If you like pop music, you'll love her. If you don't, you'll hate her. So if you like pop, buy it! It's as simple as that. It's a wonderful album. There are some not-so-great  tracks, but the good ones make up for it. 'Oops! I did it again' stays in  your head for a LOOOONG time, just as 'Baby One More Time' did. While some  people say Britney can't sing, I personally love her style.
B00004SYZ8|5.0|Great CD, tracks from which have been used for the 2000 Tour de France opening and closing themes on Eurosport this summer. Perfect soundtrack for David Millar, Lance Armstrong &amp; 'The Pirate' Pantani.
B000000FG8|5.0|I've had this CD in my collection since I was in 9th grade (I'm now a college sophomore in case you're wondering).  When I was younger I dug the punk/ska/reggae rhythms and the charged vocal delivery.  As I've gotten a  little older and more politically aware, I find the lyrics inspiring as  well.  Some of these songs are total anthems.  &quot;Take Warning&quot;  should be as well-known as &quot;Get Up Stand Up&quot;.  When I was in high  school EVERY punk/ska group covered Take Warning.  I read in another review  that someone thought the singer is now a butcher.  To the best of my  knowledge, he joined the Peace Core (sp?) after the group broke up.
B000001EMW|5.0|When I hear this apocalyptica CD, I can believe that, the metallica's sound is reproduced very well.<br />A personal opinion: If you want to buy the metallica´s (and of course, pantera and faith no more) songs in  &quot;clasic&quot; style, dont thing so much, THIS is the right chice,  forget the patetic S&amp;M album... Apocalyptica is NOW, metallica is PAST.
0671042858|4.0|I am far from being a Stephen King fan, but I must say that he is a masterful writer in this work.  The girl is lost in the woods after a truly beleivable sequence of events where she got separated from her mother and  other members of her party.  King places you side-by-side with this girl,  wise in the ways of the woods, in many respects.  You walk with her.  You  sense her mounting apprehension.  You come to rely on hearing how Tom  Gordon is doing.  The reader must marvel at her tenacity and staying power.  King takes you right up to the end, arm-in-arm with the girl.
0312853238|1.0|I bought this book wanting to like it.  Given the awards it has won, I fully expected to like it.  But I was completely disappointed.  The reason for the book's popularity is clear: it panders to a very common personality  flaw among young, intellectual males: a belief in one's own intellectual  superiority, the notion that one is rejected simply because one is so much  &quot;smarter&quot; than others of the same age.  The way the characters  talk about their own &quot;smartness&quot; is totally juvenile and  ridiculous.  This theme of the intellectually superior adolescent is also  hackneyed beyond belief.  It turns up over and over again, especially in  science fiction; and no doubt this happens at least partly because the  author knows it will sell to the cadres of geeks who imagine themselves  geniuses.  For a mature person, this sort of stuff is simply tiresome.
B000001F5F|5.0|Two of things that make U2 such as special band is their passion and energy.  While these traits are present on their studio albums, they come to the front in their live performances.  Under A Blood Red Sky perfectly  captures all their raw emotions and energy.  The album opens with the  soaring &quot;Gloria&quot; from their October album and then seiges into  &quot;11 O'Clock Tick Tock&quot;.  Next is a scorching version of their  first hit &quot;I Will Follow&quot;.  &quot;Party Girl&quot; is a great  lost U2 song.  It was originally issued as a b-side and available on  imports only.  It starts off with just the Edge strumming his guitar and  builds up to a powerful crescendo.  Bono states on the record that  &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; is not a rebel song, but it is definately  an anthem.  Bono has always had a bit of a preacher in him and as he urges  the crowd to chant &quot;no more&quot;, the album takes on the feel of an  old time revival.  After whipping things up to a fever-pitch, &quot;The  Electric Co.&quot; and &quot;New Year's Day&quot; follow and they mellow  things out. The hymn-like &quot;40&quot; is the final track and the album  ends on a poignant note with just the crowd singing the chorus.  For those  of you who may only be familar with the U2 of the 90's and their mammoth  Pop Mart and Zooropa concerts, this album is a fine sampler of their  earlier efforts.  While the approach is simplier in nature, it produces  just as big of a sound.
B000002C1V|4.0|Waters was at his top creative form in this album, and this is clear here, where the songs go from one to another with majesty. But beware. We cannot call this a &quot;rock Album&quot;. There are almost no drums for  instance! , almost no guitar solos. THe strong parts are really the lyrics  showing Waters'pain.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I am so tired of all the stupid remarks about Britney Spears. Does it ever occur in your head that that is just completly saying &quot;JEALOUS! .&quot;  OKAY, I admit it. She can be a little weird.      Her album is listened to every day in my house. I know almost every dance  move to Oops!... I did it Again. The album is more her than ...Baby One  More Time. Both albums are my favorite CD's in the world. I am listening to  her music as I type this!                     If you do not have Oops!..I  Did it Again, I really suggest that you get it very, very soon. This album  has something for every person. This album is on the better side of music.    Britney is a teen idol. She deserves to be in the spot that she is. If you  ever watch MTV, you will know how hard she really worked to get in the  place that she is. Not everyone has the talent and will power that she has.      I love her new video Lucky. It's kind of depressing about how Lucky has  everything but she is not happy with what she has or who she is.            Every girl dreams to be Britney. That means that there is not just junk  behind her sweet face. I really want the world to know how great Britney  Spears is.<br />I rate Lucky as #1.<br />#2 is Oops I did it Again<br />#3 is Don't  Go Knockn' on my Door<br />I would have to say #4 is Stronger<br />#5 is What U  See (Is What U get)<br />#6 is Satisfaction (I Can't Get No)<br />Britney Spears  is really a great person.

B000007SIN|5.0|First thing i did after buying my new DTS receiver was to find a DTS encoded music cd. The store i went to only had Gaucho. I never had a steely dan CD before, so i was a bit reluctant, but then decided to go for it.   The music: - &quot;Hey ninteen&quot; and &quot;Babylon sisters&quot; are  great but &quot;Gaucho&quot; is certainly the best title.  The DTS mix:  Amazing! I have other DTS CDs (Sting,Brand new day and Clapton,461 Blvd)  but this one sound the most natural to me. The music just seems to come  from the right places! On certain titles you'll hear sound travelling  around you, Backing vocals coming from the back and a lot  of surprises..  As i said: If you're exploring DTS - buy this!
0671027344|4.0|I read The Perks Of Being a Wallflower expecting a reincarnation of an overused coming of age formula. I was pleasantly relieved.  Chbosky certainly summoned the tradition of Holden Caufield in Charlie but created  a modern portrait that has reinvigorated the genre.  Charlie, like  Caufield, lacks the adolescent spirit of complascency and instead allows  his mind to ponder truth where there are only lies.  Charlie has his  friends, who have clearly lived the same hell, to guide him through the  gauntlet of acceptance, understanding and presence.  Charlie's age is  inconsequential.  And while his experiences are hardly universal, he seeks  and finds (most of) the answers that subconsciously trouble a generation.   Charlie seeks the answers to the questions most of us will not ask.   Chbosky has personified the voice of our generation.

6303394000|4.0|With a typically sardonic and vicious glare, Bob Fosse examines his own obsessive life as a creator/director/choreographer -- and womanizer, drinker, druggie.  While this movie has its shamelessly over-the-top  qualities (Jessica Lange as Death, for one), the musical sequences are so  dazzling that they instantly make this move a must-see, if not must-have,  for any Fosse fan.  The opening, a wow-you-in-the-gut audition sequence set  to On Broadway (Benson's stunning version), does more in four minutes than  the film of Chorus Line does in its entire running time to convey the show  biz world of Broadway.  And the then-gamine Ann Reinking is on hand to  literally play herself, as well as dance in that feline way.  The musical  number Take Off With Us is at once amusing, sparkling, sensual and  spectacular, featuring an explosive ensemble of dancers.  Fosse's bitter  take on his own mortality may slow things down (the Lenny-inspired  sequences bore into your brain) a bit, when the music is playing you are in  for a revved-up treat.
0553573411|5.0|Fitz has remained in Jhaampe in the Mountain Kingdom, recovering from the attempts on his life by his uncle, Prince Regal. In a dream of King Shrewd , he sees the suffering of the old king, as well as his beloved Molly about to be killed by the Red Ship Raiders. Fitz and Burrich return to Buckkeep, where Fitz find new challenges, new trials and new, albeit temporary, happiness.    Fitz and allies struggle to save the Six Duchies its enemies, as Regal plots to undermine Verity in a coup. Fitz becomes Prince Verity's agent in the field, being sent on missions to hold back the Red Ship Raiders. However, despite his best efforts, the Raiders grow stronger and bolder. Verity, who decides that the only hope for his kingdom is to go in search of the legendary Elderlings, mysterious semi-mythical sorcerers of the prehistory of the kingdom, sets out on a perilous quest to the far side of the Mountain kingdom. Fitz remains behind to secure the ailing throne, but quickly becomes embroiled in intrigues, one of which is to place him upon the throne.    This is the tale of FitzChivalry Farseer. The discovery that this illegitimate son exists is enough to topple Prince Chivalry's ambition for the throne. He abdicates, ceding the title of heir to the throne to his younger brother Verity and abandoning the child to the care of the stable master Burrich. The youngest prince, Regal, has ambitions of his own, and wishes to do away with the illegitimate FitzChivalry. But old King Shrewd sees the value of taking the lad and training him as an assassin. For an illegitimate royal can be sent into dangers where a trueborn son could not be risked, and may be given tasks that would soil an heir's hands.     And so FitzChivalry is trained in the secret arts of being a royal assassin. He shows a predilection for the Wit, a beast magic much despised in the Six Duchies. This secret vice in the young assassin is tolerated, for a partnership with an animal may be a useful trait in an assassin. Whenit is discovered that he may possess the hereditary magic of the Farseers, the Skill, he becomes both the King's weapon, and an obstacle to Prince Regal's ambitions for the throne. At a time when the rivalry for the throne is intense, and the Outislanders and their Red Ship raiders are bringing war to the Six Duchies, FitzChivalry discovers that the fate of the kingdom may very well rest on the actions of a young illegitimate heir and the King's Fool. Armed with little more than loyalty and his sporadic talent for the old magic, Fitz follows the fading trail of King Verity who has traveled beyond the Mountain Kingdom and into the realm of the legendary Elderlings in what may be a vain hope to renew an old alliance.     Robin Hobb's first series introduces us to the Farseer line of Kings, and a well detailed and scripted world of dragons and magic. In Hobb's world, magic is the power of the mind, and sorcerers come in two varieties: those with Skill magic, to influence the minds of men, and those of Wit magic, who do the same with beasts.
0425170349|4.0|This is the first Clancy book I've read since Clear &amp; Present Danger came out (yep, it's been a while) - the only reason I chose Rainbow Six over several others was because Chavez was in it.  He's my favorite Clancy  character and I was disappointed he got so little face time in the movie.   Maybe he'll get more action in the next one.<br />Despite the length of the  book, it contains very little fluff.  Even the parts that could have been  less developed (like Popov's early morning horse rides), while not always  crucial to the plot, had purpose.  As always, the technical stuff and  battle scenes were top notch, and he spent more time on character  development than I remember from his earlier stuff.<br />The thing I was most  impressed with was how he jumped from character to character, getting  inside their heads and illustrating their respective viewpoints so  skillfully.  From Clark's intensity, to the machismo of Chavez, to the  pragmatism of Popov, to the by-the-book legality of the FBI agents, to the  fanatical idealism of the terrorists and Project members, he wore each hat  with aplomb.  It was fascinating to see the same moral and environmental  issues analyzed by opposing thought processes - sort of a self debate.   Clancy did such a good job, there were times I thought he could be a  Project member himself.<br />I admit the overall plot was a little hard to  swallow, but by Hollywood standards it was realistic and down-to-earth.   Considering what some people are willing to do for their beliefs, it's not  that farfetched.  This is definitely a strong candidate for the next Clancy  movie.  I can't wait to see how the environmentalists react when it comes  out . . .
0553573403|5.0|This is a stellar start to the series by the author. The story unfolds with each chapter varying perspective between the various characters (and it takes some getting used to), but you cannot put it down. The emphasis  here is on the intrigue, and not magic(though later books promise gradually  more of the latter). Obviously heavily drawn from incidents in our own  world's middle-ages, the death of a debauched king turns a unified kingdom  into a collection of petty states and civil war. By the end of the first  book, one wonders how it will be possible to pull all of the various states  together into a single empire again. Character development is first rate,  and the plot line(s) are well thought out. There are at least five major  plot lines running simultaneously just in Book 1, and Martin does a stellar  job at keeping you not only interested in each, but of making sure you dont  forget the action in a particular plot line thus far, despite several  intervening chapters.

0783241542|5.0|Not many people that are older than 30 or so  will like this movie.  American Pie is a movie made almost exclusively for the teen and younger twenties audience.  The jokes mostly revolve around sex and sex related  material (which has to be there considering the movie is about four guys  wanting to lose their virginity), so if that bothers you I wouldn't buy  this movie.  The jokes in this movie work very nicely though, and  are good  for more than a few chuckles. The teens in this movie are actually pretty  good actors, with Jason Biggs leading them with some fine comic work.  I  also really loved the dad in this movie, he was just hilarious with the  ways he tried to relate to his son (Jason Biggs), some of the conversations  between the dad and son were the funniest parts of this movie.  If all the  sex related material doesn't bother you, I'm sure you'll find this to be a  very funny movie. Strongly recommend for teens.

B000003N7G|5.0|This is one of the most widely known classics by John Coltrane, with good reason, this album is excellant.  Coltrane plays beautifully on this album, he is at his best here.  If you are a big jazz fan you must buy this album.   The only part I don't like is the minute or so where &quot;A Love  Supreme&quot; is chanted, other than that this is a masterpiece.  Coltrane  fans will not be disapointed.
B00003CX59|2.0|How could a movie crew this talented mess up this badly? Christina Ricci (Mermaids, Adams Family), Johnny Depp (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?), director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman), a well casted array of character  actors, it should have been great. However, even these fine actors have  trouble spitting out the unintentionally funny, wooden dialogue. The  cinema-photography is wonderful, atmosphere very imaginatively done. Sadly,  the pluses and minuses barely add up to the two star level.

B00003Q43G|4.0|Here is director James Cameron warming up for his masterpiece, Titanic. Is there any other director who even comes close to the nonstop pacing Cameron  is able to sustain? Ed Harris (Truman Show, Apollo 13) brings his  underrated, intense, very believable acting talent and pulls off a great  performance. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Color of Money, January Man)  as his wife and co-worker almost matches him. They make a memorable couple.  The rest of the cast is quite  good, and technically the film is breaks a  lot of ground. The DVD version come with a full disc of supplemental  material; trailers,  analysis of the script, a great deal of material on  the technical problems which were solved, casting and the training they  required to pull off this movie and much more, all accessed from a neat,  fun computerized recreation of the movie set. If there is any weakness to  this movie you might say the ending doesn't float as well as what comes  before, but that doesn't stop me from saying: don't miss this experience.
0812567110|4.0|It is a tale of moral decadence and debauchery. Dorian seems consumed in his self portarit, his love for himself is so big that he cannot see beyond his image and when his true image dawns on him he dies.

B00000269M|5.0|This is my favourate album of all time, I love this album so much. There are no weak songs, so it's no wonder Michael got 7 number 1 songs from this album. Most songs are upbeat, but there are Speed Demon and Dirty Diana (My  favorite song) which are rock/pop songs. Man In The Mirror and I Can't Stop  Loving You are sweet soft ballads. Just Good Friend got the best 2  vocalests in history, a duet Michael with Stevie Wonder. and I must say  they're great together. I recomend this album to fans and nonfans of  Michael Jackson.
0553573403|5.0|The Game of Thrones is everything that a great fantasy epic should be, terrific characters, exciting and intruiging plots, war, sex, romance, and a little of the mysterious and the unknown. I remember feeling this same  way when I first read The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan and thought,  terrific! I have finally discovered a great new fantasy series to get lost  within. Martin has a great talent for describing a scene, from the  frightening, (John's battle with the Undead in his commanders room, to the  heroic, (the final scene with Dany). His castles are large and forbidding,  his line that draws good from evil is muted by the various shades that lie  within them. I know, there is so much danger that Martin can succumb to,  focusing on the wrong characters, introducing too many new faces in a never  ending narrative, having his protagonists become too familiar and  repetative, but I am confident that this won't happen here. As again, with  early Jordan, the story seems to want to go somewhere, to tell it's tale  and be economical with the lengthy introspective passages that tend to bog  these kinds of stories down. There are many kinds of sword and sorcery  stories out there, mostly generic, and recycled Tolkien, with poor  plotlines, bad villans, and heros, and heroines, that have no flaws in them  whatsoever. Martins book gives us so much more than cute elves, haughty  gods, or invincible paladins. And it only promises to get better! The Game  of Thrones is killer fantasy storytelling.
0385484518|4.0|I read &quot;Morrie&quot; a couple of years ago and found it to be very good. As a retired teacher and coach, it's understandable I'd find Morrie's final lessons of interest. Still, I've wondered at the incredible longevity  of the book on the bestseller lists. It's very good; so are many other less  heralded and far less successful books. One I encountered recently, on the  New Arrivals shelf in the public library, is &quot;Mountain City&quot; by  Gregory Martin.  The cover appealed to me as did the title - I love  mountains. Perusal told me it was the true story of the 33 modern day  residents of Mountain City, Nevada, a nearly dead old mining town tucked up  near the Idaho border.  The author is the nephew of the Basque family that  owns the general store serving the town and nearby ranches and an Indian  reservation.  Often he visits the town and his extended family there,  especially his grandparents, to whom the book is dedicated. He has helped  out in the store since boyhood. He knows all the people of this remote  area; he knows the history of their families and the town.  The book is  comprised of those stories. As a result, it starts a little slowly.  Ordinary lives are like that. But gradually you develop enormous interest  in, and respect for, these simple but extraordinary people.  They are old.  All the young are gone; only the author, a visitor in his 20s, and his  uncle, who is in his 40s, are under 50.      With Mitch Albom's book, you  knew from the first how it would &quot;come out.&quot; With Mountain City,  the sadness at the end is almost shocking, but then you realize its  inevitablity. This is real life; these are real people. You close the book  with enormous respect for Gregory Martin and this tribute he has written to  his family, their neighbors, and this far away but oh so admirable  community.       So, if you liked &quot;Morrie,&quot; I urge you to give  &quot;Mountain City&quot; a try. It may never gain more than a tiny  fraction of the readership of &quot;Morrie,&quot; but to me it is an even  better, more touching and moving tribute of a young person to the old.
1559409002|5.0|I rented Carnival of the Souls about 5 years ago on a raggedy old VHS tape, not knowing what it was at all, and I thought it was great, definatly weird! Now we have a Criterion DVD that has a near Perfect Transfer!  Carnival of Souls is a Horror film where dark, eerie atmosphere is the key  ingredient to it's success, helped along by haunting organ music, and some  unusual settings. It moves at a very deliberate pace, building up to it's  strange finale. There is little, if any gore. This was a cheaply made film,  but then again, so was Night of the Living Dead, which borrows quite a bit  from this film. Why is this one relatively unknown? Lack of Advertising  dollars! It will probably not scare you as much as leave you feeling  uncomfortable or chilled. Acting in the film by Candace Hilligoss is great,  considering what her role required. The extras are fantastic, the only one  I didn't care for was the Mental Hygiene portion, but I even liked some of  that. I would recommend watching the Director's cut first. I started this  at 10:00 P.M. and finished about 3:30 A.M., this DVD is Packed!
B00003CXDU|5.0|O.K.,I will admitt it:I only watched the movie becuase I am a really big Tim Allen fan.That was the first time. The second time I watched it because it was really funny (allthough I never saw a single Star Trek episode). The  third time I watched it because it is absolutely genious. The plot,the  jokes,the cast,the scenery and everything else is fantastic. I will wait  till I can buy it in Germany,and then it certainly will get my most watched  video this year.And not only because of that great Captain Kirk-parodie  performed by Tim Allen...
0887306101|5.0|Market Wizards is one of those few books that you just buy. No questions, just buy. No where else can you find such concrete lessons from the best traders of our time. The interview with Richard Dennis alone is worth the  admission. This man lays it out straight that anyone can learn to trade. In  fact, he proves it with a trading experiment he conducted with complete  novices. Market Wizards goes beyond the sound bites so popular on TV. If  you want to understand the pyschological underpinnings of trading success,  the author Jack Schwager has compiled a worthy read.

0767802659|3.0|It's unfortunate, but Starship Troopers really fails in so many places where it could have done better. Although movie adaptations of classic books are known to be touchy and usually poor, it's clear that there was  little or no attempt to preserve the integrity of Heinlein's story.<br />It's  just silly to have the mobile infantry fighting the bugs with ordinary  machine guns when Heinlein equipped them with super-suits and truly  advanced weaponry. And was there a point in robbing the bugs of their own  weaponry and space vessels? The bugs in this movie are just big, stupid  creatures whose only benefit is that they're really tough and can shoot  themselves into space; it's a pale mockery of the book's vision.<br />Worse,  though, is the portrayal of the government. Heinlein was known to  experiment with alternate forms of government in his books, and this  &quot;franchise by participation&quot; model was one of the more  interesting ones he tried. However the movie completely misinterpreted this  concept as some sort of neo-Fascism, which shows in the censorship of the  TV clips, the uniforms, and even their sigil. Yet in the book, the good  guys were as American as apple pie; there was no trace of this dogmatic  Nazi garbage.<br />To compare the movie entirely to the book would be futile,  but still the writers didn't even put much effort into making a good movie  of it by unrealistically underequipping the good guys and pointlessly  disarming the bugs. The effects are decent, the plot is as good as can be  expected, but there's just no excusing that poor way it was all carried  out.<br />Read the book by Robert Heinlein; it's better on a hundred levels.

B000007NWI|5.0|....where have all the great songwriters gone?  This *posthumous release of alternate takes and &quot;just didn't quite make it to the album&quot; songs is simply extraordinary.  The tracks are a bit rough, however you  must keep in mind these were never meant to be released so, all is  forgiven.  Personally, I whole-heartedly enjoy the studio chatter between  Syd and Dave; it gives this collection a partially laid-back feel.  <br />20  tracks (including the six bonus, which are amazing)of pure un-refined  genius is what you get (plus, a hilarious, incorrectly translated lyric  sheet.)  I mean, come now, you'll have these profound musical stylings of  Syd AND Japanese humor to boot.  How could anyone refuse that?<br />So kids,  if sufficient funds remain after purchasing Britney Spears, grab one of  Syd's as well.  I guarantee your mother will find the charred remains of  &quot;Oops, I did it again&quot; in the wood-burner the next  morning.<br />*Refers to the creative death of Syd Barrett.
0380788624|1.0|I was only able to get to page 64 of this clunker.  Genitalia is mentioned often; the author even manages to slip in a reference during the attack on Pearl Harbor. <br />I should mention that I am not a fan of cyberpunk, and  thought Snow Crash was only OK.
0140446117|5.0|Who would think that an unfinished autobiography could be so good?  But despite its rough edges and  the odd passage of interest only to the author, the Life of Henry Brulard is very good indeed, and as moving as The  Red and the Black.  Early in the Life, Stendhal describes the pleasure of  reading Florentine goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini's memoirs, so fresh, he  notes, that they seem to have been written yesterday.  The same could be  said for  Stendhal's own autobiography.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is on the DVD version.  The SFX (esp. if you have digital surround) are not over done (ie. some of the louder action movies). The movie moves along well with only a few necessary slow spots. I enjoyed being able to  watch this with my whole family (although S. Weaver could have covered up  her wonder bra more).  The only negative aspect of the movie was the weak  ending - much like a sitcom it is all wrapped up in a neat little package  at the end and the kid-hero appears to get nothing more than a thank you at  the end.  Still a good fun movie that you can watch over and over again.

B00004T1HK|5.0|This CD is very good. It is very catchy, but most of it is &quot;listen to it once&quot; music- you aren't inclined to hit the repeat button. But all of the songs stand out in some way.  Track 1- Oops!... I Did It Again- Very  catchy. Everyone's heard it, so I won't start.<br />Track 2- Stronger- Kind of  corny, but all in all a good beat and like &quot;Oops&quot;, extremely  catchly.<br />Track 3- Don't Go Knockin...- An R&amp;B flavor we haven't seen  from Britney before. Good beat, and Britney does a good job of singing a  pitiful song.<br />Track 4- (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction- A good cover of a  classic, but the snare part is over-stressed. A respectable remake.<br />Track  5- Don't Let Me Be...- A country song from Shania Twain and her husband,  Britney handles it very well. She could continue into country, but she's  better in pop.<br />Track 6- What U See (Is What U Get)- Sounds too much like  &quot;Oops!&quot;, but a good song all in all.<br />Track 7- Lucky- At first I  couldn't stand this song, but I listened to it and started to like it. The  video is cool too with Britney guiding Lucky through her life.<br />Track 8-  One Kiss From You- Bubblegumish (is that a word?) pop that is good, but  should have been on BOMT and &quot;Sometimes&quot; on Oops.<br />Track 9-  Where Are You Now- I can't even begin to describe how awesome this song is.  Britney has conquered the high notes in this song and has shown her  improvement. This song has to be listened to all the time. The one  repeatable song on the CD.<br />Track 10- Can't Make You Love Me- A cool, lite  song with freestanding lyrics that just flow with the music.<br />Track 11-  When Your Eyes Say It- Another song I hated at first, now I love. A good  song once you get past the Britney talking part. As scary as it is, the  song is respectable.<br />Track 12- Dear Diary- Thank God Britney did not  write this song alone. Now I can't nblame her totally for it. A waste of a  track, but Britney should work on her songwriting before she does any more  of it.<br />This CD is a must have for anyone who likes or even respects pop  music
B000008GEF|3.0|This record marked the beginning of the end of George Harrison's career as an important artist. The post-breakup, break-out success of \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" (ATMP), and the groundbreaking event that was the \\"Concert for  Bangladesh,\\" had some people assuming that Harrison was an equal to John  Lennon and Paul McCartney. This album proved otherwise. Harrison has a thin  voice that seemed to sound a lot thinner starting with some of the cuts on  this album. George Martin worked best with Harrison's voice, and Phil  Spector did a good job with it as well. Harrison's voice needs a strong  producer, and he would go years without one. George, the car buff, was also  out of artistic gas by the end of this recording session. Just as Harrison  had not kept up with the guitarists of his generation who honed their licks  while he fiddled with sitars and mantras, he would also not invest much  time in becoming a good songwriter or a stronger singer. This was to be  Harrison's swan song as a major talent. Living in the Material World is not  without its charms. The title track is an interesting song sung well,  topped by Harrison's trademark slide guitar. \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,\\"  is easily the best song of the collection. An unpretentious car-radio pop  song, done with a sense of humor that is a nice contrast to (and break  from) the heavy songs about spirit and commitment to faith. However,  Harrison was starting to show that he didn't have much to say as a writer.  \\"Give Me Love\\" was a top-ten hit, but it was fluff. It also smacked of  Lennon's \\"Give Peace A Chance,\\" and his own \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" from ATMP  (which sounded so much like \\"He's So Fine,\\" that Harrison was sued).  Harrison was starting to leave a substantial paper trail. George Martin  once played down Harrison's talent by implying that his standard,  \\"Something,\\" was actually pinched from an artist at Apple Records named  James Taylor. Taylor's first album at the Beatle record company had a song  titled, \\"Something In the Way She Moves Me.\\" Hmmm. \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues,\\"  covered the same terrain as McCartney's \\"You Never Give Your Money.\\"  The  rest of the album consists of Harrison-style spirituals, with \\"Who Can See  It,\\" and \\"Be Here Now,\\" the best of that lot. Harrison, like Lennon, would  become a bit of a one-note Nellie. While Lennon would spend his solo years  as a confessional faux radical (and probably not a very honest one at  that), Harrison would spend years trying to make his spiritual world  interesting in song. Fans were getting sick of both, while McCartney's pop  kept him as popular as ever (this despite the constant stream of snide  remarks by those love-and-peace advocates John Lennon and George Harrison).
0800177177|5.0|Bram Stoker's orginal vision was some what different than what Francis Ford Coppla has brought to the screen, but doesn't all adaptations end up the same. Look at Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, the similarities between  the book and the movie were very small, but the film was still a wonderful  film.  If you have read the original novel by bram stoker, I suggest you  forget about it.  This film is a wonderfully scary masterpiece of forbidden  love and terror.  Bram Stoker's Dracula is a passionate love story and a  terrifying vision of the undead and their quest for blood. The acting is  great and the costumes are lavish, transporting you into the time and place  of an 18th century London.  Even Keanu Reeves does a decent job as Jonathan  Harker, even though his acting skills and talents do not go as far as say  Sir Anthony Hopkins, it's still a decent performance. See this film.
B000002UCQ|4.0|I remember wearing this record out when it was first released. At that time it seemed like many of the great `60's acts were either splitting (Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane, etc.) or really splitting  (Hendrix, Joplin, etc.). Also, shortly after its release, John Lennon would  do his infamous 2-part, \\"Life with the Lions\\" interview with Rolling Stone  magazine. In it, Lennon would, among other things, let out his disdain for  just about everyone. Considered shocking at the time, the interview comes  off as a hypocritical and embarrassing contrivance thirty years later. It,  along with the other breakups and deaths (and Kent State), made \\"All Things  Must Pass\\" sound almost like an aural arm around the shoulder. The album,  reviewed in one of those two issues of Rolling Stone has aged well enough.  It should be remastered, but even that won't cover its flaws. The record  was over produced, and did not have enough A-list material to be a double  album - a third disk of jam sessions, for the most part, sans vocals, is  included. It could have been a great single album. That said, the record  was thoughtfully recorded and packaged, as was its successor, the ground  breaking \\"Concert for Bangladesh.\\"  I mention this is as a sad irony. Four  years later, Harrison would tear up his vocal chords recording an album  (\\"Dark Horse,\\" 1974) and release it with the flawed vocal tracks. He would  then proceed to tour before his throat fully recovered. The shot pipes, the  refusal to do any Beatle material in a straightforward manner, the  religious tone of the tour, as well as the album (and its predecessor) left  many fans cold, many arenas not sold out, and Harrison bitter with America.  The tour would be the biggest let down of the post-Beatles Beatle scene of  the `70's. Harrison would never again be the force that he was in the  rock'n'roll world. \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" is an outstanding record. It is  perhaps underrated because it is identified with Harrison's fascination  with Hinduism, and Indian music. In fact, there is very little of either in  any direct or proselytizing way. Just as many people stay away from Paul  McCartney's \\"Tug of War\\" album because of the cringe-inducing single  associated with it, \\"Ebony and Ivory,\\" \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" may still turn  people off to checking out \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  That is a shame.
0782008372|2.0|I was shocked at the level of quality presented in this THX certified DVD. I have grown to rely on this certification, as most customers undoubtably have, to ensure that I'm getting the highest quality product. This goes for  equipment as well as (up to this point) DVD's.<br />The picture quality is  very poor and inconsistent throughout the film. The picture is very grainy  and washed out. The sound levels increase and decrease throughout the film  to the point where I became extremely distracted and began to pay  attenditon to the poor quality of film/sound more than to the film  itself.<br />I cannot get over the fact that this was THX certified. This  certainly puts a whole new light on the certification standards. I am so  dissapointed that I will be sending several e-mails out to other parties to  voice this opinion. Something that I never, ever do. However, I feel pretty  ripped off after viewing this film.<br />That said, there is one scene that  does shine. The last battle. Very nicely done and very clear and clean  visually.<br />Too bad. Otherwise the premise of this film is pretty  interesting. The screenplay varies from exceptional to cheesy. Again,  inconsistency. Someone else should have overseen production on this one.  Could have been a keeper.
B000002UCQ|4.0|I wore this album out when it first came out. Along with the Beatles, a lot of the great '60's acts were either splitting (Jefferson Airplane, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, etc.) or really splitting (Joplin, Hendrix, etc.)  during 1970. This album was kind of comforting, especially when shortly  after it's release, Lennon gave his infamous 2-part &quot;Life with the  Lions&quot; interview with Rolling Stone, and let out the dirty little  secret that the four pretty much hated each other by the end (the record  was in fact reviewed in one of those two issues).      The album ages okay.  Even if it is remastered, however, the over production, and the weaker  material show that what could've been a great single record is instead a  longer, flawed set. It is a shame that the care that went into the  recording and packaging of this album and the following landmark  &quot;Concert for Bangladesh,&quot; would be completely missing four years  later. In 1974 Harrison hurried an album out even though his voice was  shot, and proceeded to tour before his voice recovered fully. The shoddy  pipes, the refusal to do Beatle material in a straight forward manner and  the shoving of his fascination with hinduism &amp; Indian music in the  fans' face, made the tour one of the biggest let downs of the post-Beatles,  Beatle scene. Harrison has been bitter with U.S. fans ever since, and has  never been an artist of substance since. Like Lennon, he would constantly  be found ignoring the messages he preached in his songs to cheap shot  McCartney. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; reminds me of Paul's &quot;Tug  of War&quot; album in that it is a very, very good record, that is very  underrated. Both records suffer from perceptions stemming from their  initial singles (&quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; from George, and the  cringe-inducing &quot;Ebony and Ivory,&quot; from Paul).
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This album is the best album I have heard this year.  Its a pitty that Australian record company Warner Brothers have not promoted the album at all since its release.  Radio stations have also made the great error in  not picking up these songs for the radio. All it needs is some promotion  and it would be an easy Number 1 selling album.  This CD really grows on  you.  The more you listen the better it becomes. GO BUY IT

B000002C2E|5.0|The third coming of Dylan? After Dylan's initial coming, the now understandably mythologized and canonized period from 1962 to 1966, and his second coming trilogy of &quot;Planet Waves&quot;, &quot;Blood On the  Tracks&quot; (also arguably his finest album ever) and &quot;Desire&quot;,  Dylan's second slump (unlike his first from '67 to '73) was far too long.   Despite occasional bright spots from his Christian album trilogy (most  notably the much underrated &quot;Shot of Love&quot; album) and songs like  &quot;Lenny Bruce&quot;, &quot;Brownsville Girl&quot;, &quot;Every Grain of  Sand&quot; and &quot;Silvio&quot;, Dylan's career that stretched the twenty  years '77 to '97 was oftentimes dull, pretentious, unremarkable and, well,  just plain bad.  However, compared to other career slumps in the 1980s,  Dylan still managed to offer glimpses of genius even while swamped in the  keyboard swamped and overproduced world of the 1980s(unlike others, like  Tom Waits, who in the 1980s went on to produce the most original, offbeat  and decidedly un-80s music).  After Dylan's most unrewarding year of 1988  (which gave birth to his two most abysmal recordings &quot;Down In the  Groove&quot; and one of his few entirely unreedemable albums &quot;Dylan  and the Dead&quot;), Dylan released &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;.  Didn't see that  one coming.  It features distinctive production by that most distinctive of  producers (and not always in a good way), Daniel Lanois (of U2 Achtung Baby  fame).  In retrospect, this marriage may go down as one of the most  fruitful in rock history.  &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; was a mixed affair: it  produced some of Dylan's more notable failures: &quot;Political  Science&quot;, and packed with some of his more uninspired lyrics, yet at  the same time, it features fascinations -&quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;, a  Dylan original, sounds both ancient and new; in other words, it's one of  Dylan's most timeless and haunting songs.  But what is most notable about  &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; is how it sounds after the release of &quot;Time Out  of Mind&quot;: the former works as a kind of extended prelude for the  latter.  After &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;, Dylan saw a key selection of his  bootlegs hit the shelves, along with yet another &quot;greatest hits&quot;  package.  Add to that two albums of covers of songs (&quot;Good As I Been  To You&quot; and &quot;World Gone Wrong&quot;, which rank among his best  performances) hearkening back to his years as a folkie, and earlier, it was  the kind of period of career summation where most of us would begin to  write our wills and pick out a good stone for the grave.  Listen to Dylan's  gravely voice sing some of the most completely original renditions of songs  like &quot;Jim Jones&quot;, &quot;Canadee I-O&quot;, &quot;Arthur  McBride&quot;, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;World Gone Wrong&quot;,  &quot;Blood In My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Lone Pilgrim&quot; (just to name a  few of the key performances from those albums, the latter being a personal  favorite); in tandem with Dylan's earliest recorded work one gets a sense  not only of the extent of Dylan's growth as a musician, but also  sense of  degredation: you can hear it in Dylan's increasingly ragged voice.  So it's  without wonder that &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; focuses on aging and  facing death - it's with total wonder that Dylan, after so many previous  times, has evolved once again.  It's a testament to Dylan.  Most rock stars  end up like the Stones.  In truth, the album is best heard in its entirety:  there's plenty of catchy grooves (&quot;Dirt Road Blues&quot;,  &quot;Million Miles&quot; and &quot;Highlands&quot;, most notably) and  plenty of tear jearkers (&quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot;, &quot;Standing  In the Doorway&quot;) and plenty of cynicism (&quot;Love Sick&quot;).  As  far as emotional output, &quot;Time&quot; ranks with &quot;Blood On the  Tracks&quot;.  When it comes to Dylan, it comes right down to feeling, and  this albumcontains more feeling than his original work over the past  twenty years  put together.  Grammy award winning album of the year.  Damn  straight.
B000002USN|5.0|Sure his voice may not sound the same as it did when he was 30 (how could it?), but the fact is that Frank was still going strong at age 77!  How many people, let alone SINGERS, can say that?  Sure some of these songs  aren't GREAT, but enough are to warrant buying this CD.  &quot;The Lady is  a Tramp&quot;, &quot;What Now My Love&quot;, &quot;I've Got You Under My  Skin&quot;, and &quot;One For My Baby&quot; are GREAT.  His &quot;...Crush  on You&quot; duet with Streisand is also very well done.  A chance to hear  the Greatest with some contemporary artists.  To whoever said that  Streisand's voice can compare to Sinatra's at any age, I can only say that  I feel sorry for you.
6305807086|5.0|After reading a few reviews of this movie it is clear that it is a movie that you either love or hate. Personally, I love it. It is easily the best movie of 1999, and fully deserved its three Oscar nominations. John Cusack  is well cast as a struggling puppeteer whose life takes a strange turn when  he discovers a hidden door in his office. Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz  also put in fine performances. John Malkovich has a tough role to play but  pulls it off with conviction. If you are expecting a laugh-a-minute comedy  then this movie probably isn't for you. Although it has it's funny moments,  these are subtly played - like Cusack applying for a filing job on the  seven and a halfth floor, which has rather low ceilings (low overheads you  see, so the savings can be passed onto the customer...).  The overall  premise is pure fantasy and requires suspension of disbelief but if you are  prepared to go along with it, this movie is well worth seeing. It is very  thought-provoking. Finding a category for this movie would be a tough job,  but the best I can come up with is 'bizarre existentialist philosophical  comedy' (but don't let that put you off...). The DVD itself is very good.  Excellent picture and sound, and some extras although these are of  questionable quality. The 'interview' with director Spike Jonze is quite  frankly baffling. It takes place in a moving car and he ends up getting out  and vomiting. Whatever.  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this. It easily  slots into my top 10 movies. One of the most original movies I have ever  seen.
0446525537|3.0|I was very disappointed after reading this new Nicholas Sparks book.  (I cried all throughout his book The Notebook.)  After such a big smash hit with The Notebook I thought that this book would bring about the same types  of feelings (romance, true love, caring) that The Notebook did.  Boy was I  wrong....Don't get me wrong the last 20 pages or so were emotional, but the  beginning of the book lacks direction and fails to grab the reader and pull  you in....I am not giving up on Mr. Sparks yet since The Notebook is #1 on  my favorites list, so let us just hope he takes longer to think the  emotions and the characters through next time
B000001F7R|3.0|There are really two Def Leppards, pre-Hysteria and post-Hysteria. One is Rock and one is Pop. I can appreciate and enjoy both but there is always a part of me that wants to remember these guys as the brash teenagers who  burst on to the rock scene back in 1979 with this explosive album. If you  like the rockin era of Def Leppard chances are good you have High &amp; Dry  and Pyromania but not this one. For whatever reason this album is always a  suprise to folks looking over my CD collection, I hear alot of &quot;I  didn't know about this album&quot; or &quot;I've never heard this  before&quot; which is too bad because this album contains some killer  tunes, even the pseudo-ballad Sorrow Is A Woman has power to it. What is a  drag is that the instruments and the production methods make this album  sound really tinny and cheap. I hope that if the band ever decides to go  back to their rock roots that they simply re-record this album with modern  instruments and production methods. They should also consider bringing  guitarist Pete Willis back to help since he had a hand in creating the  album. The song Rocks Off set a level of intensity that they have never  matched since. Other songs like Rock Brigade, Hello America, Answer To The  Master, It Could Be You, It Don't Matter and Satelite are (no pun intended)  Wasted due to the shoddy production. The album High &amp; Dry contained the  song On Through The Night, how this album got it's name is a mystery to me,  it is an indication of how fast they slapped the first two together  perhaps. This album could easily be a 5 star CD if the band wanted to get  back on top and stop singing to and for the bubble gum crowd. When this  album came out Def Leppard put fear into bands like Van Halen, Black  Sabbath, Rainbow and Aerosmith. Today they don't even worry Brittny Spears.  Come on guys...what do ya say, throw us loyal long suffering rocker/fans a  bone and play it again!
0553213105|5.0|Although many might find Austen boring, I'm certainly not one of them when it comes to Pride and Prejudice.  I have to admit than Austen does have some pretty slow-moving novels, but this is not one of them.  The  characters are very lively and real.  Austen really does a good job of  creating a very charming and truly fairy tale-like situation.  This is my  favorite book to date.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is phenominal. Imagine if you will- Metallica, one of the greatest and most powerful bands ever; SFSO, one of the greatest orchestras in the world; and Michael Kamen, who did some work on nothing else matters  is back and better than ever. Imagine a Metallica song, say 'one' for  example. Now this is an absolutely brilliant song on its own, but with the  symphony and Kamen it adds a whole new light on the songs, so many melodies  and counter melodies that build layers upon an already great song, now this  to me is nigh perfection. Metallica also put in a storming performance in  which they slow down slightly, but this to me just makes it better and you  can appreciate the notes so much more. Summing up - this is an absolute  must buy. Listen to the sound bytes and see the brilliance. If you don't  buy this album because of the fact that it has a symphony alongside it, you  are being soooooo stupid. Just buy it and see what music is all about!
0679746048|4.0|I wanted to write a review for this book a while ago, but could never put my thoughts to words.  It's such a bizarre idea; a girl is proven insane in 20 minutes, then spends the next two years inside a building worse than  prison.  Kaysen writes about the people, events, and way of life within the  cement walls.  And for the most part, she tells it as a sane person.<br />The  book, at no point is a `beginning to end' tale.  It jumps around, telling a  new portion of the story at each chapter.  In chapter 9, a friend will be  talked about, but in chapter 10, the friend hasn't yet come to the  hospital.  This can be confusing at times, but is figured out soon  enough.<br />The novel (although short) forces you into the thought pattern of  the insane.  Everything is told in plain English so there is no confusion  going from the average live into the twisted world she writes about.  All  the characters are naturally interesting, without the specific quirks many  authors add to cover the missing personality.  The hardest thing to see is  that every person and event mentioned is real.  It plays so much like a  fiction, the reader begins to believe that's what it is.<br />But on top of  the wonderful stories, Kaysen also tries her hand at psychology.  She  explains conscience, memory and the entire mind with the same interest and  writing technique as she uses to write the rest of the book.  This specific  part could have easily been the downfall of the entire book, but the way  she wrote it made it the most readable section.<br />The four stars are for  the lack of order.  I spent the first three chapters wondering what exactly  was going on.  However, with that aside, it is still an excellent read.   There is some dark language but it is inevitable.  In this rare case it  actually adds to the story.  If you can get past that, pick it up.
B00004R997|2.0|Being a fan of all Disney animated cartoons and features,  I regret to say that I was quite disappointed by this release.  The problem isn't with the subject matter, but with what's actually on the DVD.  As an earler reviewer  mentioned, scenes were cut in which characters were seen smoking.  I have  to ask why? (Espcially when they leave in a scene which shows a  &quot;young&quot; airplane drinking gasoline). What else was removed from  the movie that we don't know about?  In the bonus material they mention two  other characters, an armadillo and a burro, which weren't part of the  feature.  Were they originally?  I recall seeing the burro character as a  child while watching the Wonderful World of Disney on NBC.  Maybe an expert  on Disney movies could enlighten us.<br />Disney, let parents decide what  their children should watch.  Remain true to the original films.
6302969352|5.0|Seven Samuari was the first Japanese movie I have even sceen, and what a way to start. I have been a fan of japanes animation, and culture for while and I decided to try live action. I was take in comlety by this beautiful  storie and since have been a die hard fan. Akira Kurosawa's work is truly  at it's best in this movie. The way he makes this less aobut war and more  aobut the how farmers and the samuari lives are effected. i think this film  shows how samuari wer ment to be, defenders of those in need, the touching  way they defend this village at the risk of their lives for nothing more  then a hand full of rice for meals. How the villagers are willing to risk  everything to save what they have worked so hard for. How the villager fear  the samuari at fist then grow to accpet them but know not to get close for  the risk of losing them in the battle is great. I really can not convey how  beautiful this movie is in these sort words. All I can say is if you do not  see this move then you are a fool, and you are denying your self one of the  greates cenamatic masterpieces ever created.
0060283122|1.0|A bad beginning to a dreary series.  Can't believe that anyone would like the way these are written.  The story could actually be better without all the sidelines giving definitions to the reader.  But then I suppose the  author was working under a deadline and word count.  No, this is not Harry  Potter and should not even be considered in the same class.  Drivel, in  this I mean it is badly written.

B00003CWOL|5.0|I saw this film finally last week, and what a movie. Kevin Smith has matured as a writer. The film itself is powered by infectious performances especially by renagade angels Affleck and Damon. It allows for character  development and during which the audience is empathetic with the leads even  when their moral centre goes completly awol.  I myself, a catholic was  thoroughly and profoundly impressed, but how could I expect less from the  ever impressive Kevin Smith. It doesn't make comments about catholism but  instead observations, about just how contrived religon has become in the  21st century. As Selma Hayeks' character says &quot;You don't celebrate  your religon, you mourn it&quot;.      Having only seen one other Smith  movie (Chasing Amy) I was soooo pleased with the increased participation of  Jay and Silent Bob. Those two never cease to make me chuckle. I highly  recommend this film to anyone who's not uptight, it's witty, complicated,  hysterical and believe it or not spiritual. See it now, it is one of the  best films to come out last year.
B00004TDTO|5.0|For those of us who grew on '70's movies this is one that can not be left out.  Literally creating the summer blockbuster season, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films ever made.  Speilberg took a mediocore book and  turned it into a true classic.  The characters, especially the three leads,  are fully realized and developed.  Each of the three men are different in  every way.  Yet, it the final act when they are on the Orca they all must  come together and do battle with the man eating shark.  <br />The story never  lags and the tension never lets up.  The first two acts set the final forty  minutes up flawlessly.  With the addition of John Williams and his classic  score and the supberb editing of Verna Fields, both won Oscars, it is  perfect is almost every way.  It is hard to pass this up.  It is the film  that made Speilberg and he has not looked back since.<br />On DVD the film has  never looked and sounded better.  Williams' score can finally be heard for  what it is.  The picture quality is great and the widescreen image make  this complete.  A must for DVD fans and fans of classic movies.
B000002C25|5.0|I don't know what some Oasis &quot;fans&quot; are talking about when they say Be Here Now wasn't a very good album.  I have What's The Story (Morning Glory)? also, and I don't like that one as much as I do Be Here Now.  I  like the music better, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Don't Go Away  is one of the best songs ever - a lot of heart poured into it.  Don't fall  for thinking it's a bad album.  If you like what you hear by Oasis on the  radio, you'll like Be Here Now.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This album has it all, metal for fans of the old Metallica and metal for the fans of the new Metallica.  The first cd is made up of newly done covers by the four horsemen.  The highlights are turn the page and whiskey  in the jar, though Sabbra Cadabra and It's electric deserve a mention also.   The second cd is filled up with covers that Metallica did in the past from  old garage days tapes.  My personal favorite on the second cd is Stone Cold  Crazy.  The driving guitar and vocals makes for a very energized song.  Am  I evil and blitzkrieg also are very good songs on this cd, just to mention  a few.  Overall this album is perfect for any new Metallica fan and any old  Metallica fan.
0312853238|5.0|&amp;#65279;This is an excellent, excellent, excellent book. But before I start with the review, I want to point out why I even took the time to read this book. <br />I read this book because I was depressed. I felt that I had  to drop out of school and that my life had no meaning. I told a friend of  mine. He told me to read this book... and it absolutely changed my life  around. It made me feel like just because I was being pushed around by my  teachers (who are still jerks), that I could still be the best student I  could be. I loved this book so much that I plan to buy a hardcover version.  <br />This is the story of Ender Wiggin, the brother of a person who kills  squirrels for fun and the brother of a girl who has a heart of gold. Then,  he sent of to `Battle School' to learn to fight against `The Buggers', the  alien enemy of the story. Most of the book is spent explaining what happens  to Ender during Battle School: his experiences, feelings, `battles'.  <br />This is an absolutely excellent book and you'll either love it or hate  it... I hear that adults (especially parents) hate this book... but if  you're a rebellious kid... you'll love this... just as I do. <br />ABSOLUTELY  EXCELLENT! :-) ENJOY!<br />A.A.
B000002J0P|5.0|This is the best CD I own.  The songs all come from the heart.  The music is always absolutely beautiful.  It is beautiful in simplicity and complexity.  The use of mostly guitars and three part harmony is  uncluttered, but always sounds full and rich.  The songs all sound perfect,  and offer variety.  I love all the songs, from the simplicity of Lady of  the Island, to the magnificent Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  In particular I  think this song is a masterpiece.  The way the feel changes throughout the  song is like a symphony.  The lyrics tell a story that is always relevent.
B00000IL1K|4.0|well i am not a operah lover. so mabey i don't know every little thing about music. what i do know is this is the first cd i have heard of it's kind except for enya. i think it is worth having dust in the wind is  wonderful. deliver me is a great track. all in all there are only 4 good  songs..but it is worth 4 stars just for that
0517548232|5.0|And make them read it.  Less a primer in economics than a concise debunking of crank positions on economic issues, this book can clear the air (and the mind) quickly after some interested sophist plumps for a  discredited idea.    Hazlitt's parable of the broken window, meant to show  how what dosen't happen as a result of human action is at least as  important as what does, is the best introduction to economic theory for the  average reader since Adam Smith.  The visible results that people see as a  result of government intervention in the market must be weighed against  what did not come to pass because of the reallocation of resources (i.e.,  your hard-earned money) that such action necesitates.  This book is  timeless, in that it is not tied to concrete examples drawn from the  headlines of 1946, and is also remarkably free of venom , passion, or  spite, which too often mar polemical works on economics - and serve to  camouflage bad reasoning.  This book can be a basic education in itself, or  the beginning of deeper study, in the works of Von Mises, Von Hayek,  Schumpeter, or of Hazlett himself.  Unlike his opposition (Keynes, et al),  Hazlitt is actually readable. -Lloyd A. Conway
6303913881|5.0|I remember seeing this film for the first time in the theater, and the quiet, satisfied sighs and coos being emitted from the men of the theater during the &quot;goodbye kiss&quot; scene.<br />This movie shows the  outstanding post-mafia growth of Las Vegas into a shopping/eating empire  that still manages to maintain its sexual mysticism and 24 hour access to  anything.<br />If you are at all intrigued by Las Vegas, you'll love this  overblown erotic fairytale.
B00000K32J|5.0|This video is wonderful, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It will blow you away.  Michael is the hottest Irish Dancer in the world.  Not only do I love the dancing, but I could listen to the CD of this video all day,  everyday.  I would recommend viewing his two other videos before watching  Feet of Flames.  I wish I could watch it LIVE!
044651652X|5.0|If you have ever been in love - truly in love, this is a book you cannot miss.  It shares all the joy, pain and sorrow that only someone who has been there can understand.  So far, I have read this book at least three  times over the years, and each time, it touches a part of me that it never  did before.  The movie was equally as good but the wonderful part of a book  is that you can envision the characters and the events as you wish. The  book makes us look at our own lives, our own fragile memories of that true  and eternal love that happens but once in a life time, and of making  choices that will sometimes haunt us forever.  This book is not as it seems  on the surface, about lust in a heated moment of passion; it goes much  deeper to the heart. It reminds us we are all subject to human feelings,  and that the choices we make in life will always be a part of us.  It  reminds us that &quot;our moment in the sun&quot; will live on in our  hearts forever.
079073804X|5.0|In 25 years of film, we as a human race have yet to equal the horrific and shocking vision that is The Exorcist.  Some friends of mine, grown men, refuse to view this movie due to its graphic intensity!  It matters not how  worldly you are, seeing a 12-year-old girl masturbate violently with a  silver crucifix will cost you a few sanity points!<br />The director says in  the commentary, &quot;I want to get a reaction.&quot;  Yes, even in these  days of jaded audiences and tasteless critics, the reaction will be there.
B000006OAM|1.0|THIS CD IS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER HAD THE NONPLEASURE OF LISTENING TO.......I USED THIS CD FOR FIRE WOULD I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT IT WAS WORTHY TO SELL
B00000IAU3|5.0|Hi, my name is Jenn. I would suggest that you buy this CD! I first heard of DIDO from the TV show &quot;Roswell&quot;. The song &quot;Here With Me&quot; is heard in the beginning of every episode. My first guess was  that the artist was Sarah McLachlan. But, I later found out that the artist  was Dido. I had never heard of her before. So, I went here, to Amazon.com  and hoped to find her cd, because, unfortunately I couldn't find it  anywhere else. I was lucky to find it. I bought it, and I immeadiately fell  in love with the cd. Her voice calms you down, and makes you relax. It  takes you to another world. I am so glad that I bought this CD. On a scale  of 1-5, I would rate this CD an outstanding 10! I would suggest this CD to  anyone and everyone! I hope this review helped you!
B00000J7JO|5.0|First off, if you are a newer fan of RHCP, take it from me, go out and buy Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their 1991 breakthrough album. Californication is great, but BSSM is just as good...maybe better. It would be a good move to  pick up BSSM along w/ Californication. BSSM was voted on of the top 10 best  rock albums of the 90's by RS magazine.<br />    I really like this cd. It's  w/o a doubt one of 1999's best. It is easy to see that a lot of time was  spent and a lot of planning was involved as well. The lyrics are catchy.  There is variety from song to song, rythm and vocal.     Flea's pounding  bass is what made him voted bass player of the year by rolling stone  magazine. John is one of the top guitar players today.     Every song is  good on this cd, they are all unique, yet original. I like the fact most  songs are 4min+     I recommend this cd highly to fans and ask that  non-fans listen to it. They have changed over the years.....not for the  worse, not for the better, but they made a good change and their talents  are paying off still after 17+ years in the business.
B000001FKY|5.0|This cd is 80's all the way. It has its loud moments, its sappy moments--altogether it is one great cd. &quot;Love Bites&quot; has to be the best power ballad ever written. Joe Elliott's sexy throaty vocals takes  Def Leppard's music to another level. The string arrangment is nothing to  cry abbout either. Rick Allen proved that he could still be called the  &quot;Thunder God&quot; after the amputation of an arm. This group proved  with &quot;Hysteria&quot; (the album) that they could overcome anything and  still come out on top.
B000002L3P|4.0|This is an update for a mistake of my previous writing on this cd. I didn't look at the dates on the cd's. Trouble is and then Live On are both 5 star cd's with the new lead singer. the lead singer Corey Sterling will  continue being super with another band.Noah Hurt sings with kenny's each  note.My apology for first review.I still give this cd 4 stars if not 4.5.  Blues is like being Black or White or Red or Yellow or green or blue you  are what you are.And this cd is the Blues with great people like Jesse  Thomas and James Brown helping and memories of SRV.Get all 3 KWSB CD's you  want regret it if you like Blues.
0783117388|5.0|I finally get why this series is so popular, as a late 20's something, I can totally relate to the trials and tribulations of these single women... I think that this would be a great video for a valentine's day when you  don't have a beau or just a night out with the girls... it is very thought  provoking and true to form.. While I was not watching it on a large screen  tv (only 20 inches) I found the quality of the VHS acceptable and clear.    If you are dying to know what everyone is talking about, it is well worth  the money.  I highly recommend it.
0441172717|5.0|Since enough has been written about the _Dune_ story, let me focus this review on helping the potential reader sift through the accumulated viewpoints.  I will allude to some degree to the series that follows it, on  the grounds that this pertains to whether one would want to invest the time  in the first book to begin with.<br />First off, _Dune_ is deep.  It's  exciting, and Herbert is a master of creating The Moment.  It has some of  the richest character development you will ever see.  It is often very  subtle and will tend to inspire you to question some basic assumptions.  It  is a very egalitarian book in which both genders are quite deadly.<br />So who  might not like it? Well, on your first go, it can be hard to 'get it'; my  first effort didn't succeed, as a matter of fact.  I read on, bewildered,  not understanding much.  (Lucky for me I gave it another go at a later  date.)  You should be prepared for there to be a large leap between each  book (sometimes thousands of years).  Herbert handles these quantum leaps  interestingly, but they can throw you a curve.  Also, if you want light  reading, Herbert isn't it.  And there is no question that there are mature  and sometimes disturbing themes.  (If your child is old enough to make  sense of it, s/he is probably old enough to deal with the disturbing  parts.)<br />Essentially, _Dune_ (and the series) is one of those works people  either love or they hate.  My recommendation is to try it--it is surely a  masterpiece in the eyes of many, myself included--but to be prepared to  invest time and brainpower in picking up the storyline, mulling over  questions, and other cerebral pursuits.  If you go into it armed with this  understanding, your odds of enjoying it are excellent.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is w/o a doubt one of the best of 1999. Very good lyrics. Every song is catchy amd well-scripted. Its easy to tell a lot of work was put in. A good variety (Californication and Right on Time are a world apart) Yet, I  wish younger fans would listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their 1991  release. It's one of the top albums of the 1990's (voted as top) and if you  are picking up Californication, pick up BSSM too. Seriousely, it's good,  maybe better.
B000002NJS|5.0|I think this is her best work yet. Voice is briliant and music is awsome. Go on Maddy....
0553573403|4.0|Having read the last published Jordan book in his &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, I was out looking for something as inticing and mysterious untill the next book comes out.  I have come to the judgement  that this is the best thing out there. Although there is rare mention of  any metaphysical energies, the political double backs and triple crosses  will more than make up for it. The author does a very good job of making  that(political unrest, intrigue and games) aspect of the story line  interesting, I usually find politics bland, but with the characters, who  are rounded and believeable, the political intrigue filters smoothly  between scenes of merciless masacres and righteous battles.
B000000OTU|4.0|I enjoyed this CD very much.  It's a compilation of their 3 most recent albums. my personal favorites on this album are &quot;Rag Doll,&quot; &quot;Dude (Looks Like A Lady),&quot; &quot;Eat the Rich,&quot; and  &quot;Livin' On the Edge.&quot;  The other songs are good too.  This is one  of my favorite CDs to listen to, so buy it and make it yours!
630575067X|5.0|This film gets progressively better every time u watch it. Can't wait for Episode 2.<br />PS. Major rumour!<br />U know how a lot of people were ticked that &quot;the force&quot; could only be acquired through DNA? There's a  major rumour going around that &quot;the force&quot; will evolve out of  its' &quot;Midichlorian&quot; form and into a spiritual sense allowing  anyone to access and utilize its' power.<br />U heard it here first.
B000002KLP|5.0|This is the rawest funkiest thing you will ever hear. I bet sometimes he sits down and listens to it and says DAMN!  This whole album is TIGHT it's rumored that Morris Day gave Prince partyup and in return the first  Time albun written and performed by Prince was born
6302256615|4.0|First I have to say, that as a surfer, I am biased.  However I LOVED this movie.  It is definitely in my top 10 action films of all time.  Keanu is, well, Keanu, no better, no worse.  Busey is probably better than average  here, Swayze doesn't fit the role, but does a decent job with it  nonetheless. Lori Petty was beautiful, sexy, and believable as Tyler, and  the everpresent B-movie staple, John C. McGinley was great as Harp. Chili  Pepper Anthony Kiedis makes a cameo, too.<br />The action sequences were  superb, especially the breathtaking skydiving scenes.  This movie also has  arguably the best two man chase scene in movie history. The plot is fairly  original and engaging, and Keanu has a few good one-liners that elicit a  chuckle every time.  My only real complaint is that this movie is not  available on DVD in the US.
B00004SCX6|4.0|The first time I listened to this C.D. I wasn't too impressed.  I liked a couple songs, but the majority did not appeal to me immediately. After listening to it for a while, however, I have to say that most of the songs  are really good!  My favorites are &lt;Opps!...I Did It Again&gt;,  &lt;Lucky&gt;, &lt;When Your Eyes Say It&gt;, and &lt;Dear Diary&gt;. I can  tell that she's been training hard because her voice has definately  improved!  The CD also has a lot of variety; the songs tell many different  stories and she sings many different musical styles-- Country, R&amp;B,  Pop, Rock, Soft Pop.   I've also noticed a new theme in this CD.  In her  previous CD she was more whiny and sang songs like &lt;I Was Born to Make  You Happy&gt;, &lt;Email My Heart&gt; (sounds kinda corny, huh?) and lyrics  like &quot;my loneliness is killing me...when I'm not with you I lose my  mind.&quot;  Although the songs were good, they gave off an image of a  dependent girl who was nothing without her man.  In this CD, however,  Britney acts as a better role model and is more assertive, independent, and  honest.  Her song &lt;Stronger&gt; seems to address her old song &lt;Hit Me  Baby&gt;.  The lyrics go &quot;I'm stronger than yesterday...my loneliness  ain't killin' me no more.&quot;  Her song &lt;Don't Go Knocking On My  Door&gt; also reinforces her independance. I also like the idea behind the  song &lt;What You See Is What You Get&gt;.  Strictly speaking, it's about a  pretty girl who gets a lot of attention from other guys and her boyfriend  is feeling jealous and tries to change her.  But this song has other  meanings and applies to Britney's own life.  A lot of people are critical  of Britney.  Most of these people are simply jealous or have been swept  away by false rumors from the media.  Many also feel threatened by  Britney's sex appeal-- the way she dresses, etc.  In this song, Britney  indirectly tells all listeners that what they see is what they get and that  she willnot change herself for them.  Way to go, Britney!  And another  thing which needs to be set straight:  Britney Spears did not get breast  implants!   Yeah, a lot of people would like to believe that, but it simply  is not true.  When Britney first started working on her CD she was only 15  years old, and now she's like 18.  Things happen to girls between those  years.  They mature, and that's what happened to Britney.  And it really  bothers me how people say that everything about Britney is fake.  She's no  more fake than every other singer out there.  In fact, I think she's very  honest.  She doesn't have a &quot;I'm better than you&quot; attitude.   She's really down-to-earth, crazy, silly, and a lot of fun.  People need  give her a break and stop letting out their insecurities on her!  If they  truly believe she has no talent at all, how could she ever become so  amazingly popular.  It takes a special something to have so many fans.  And  even if people don't like her voice (which is certainly unique), who can  deny that she's a hard worker (she's touring all summer!) and that her  dancing and music videos are just incredible!  All I have to say is: great  job, Britney!
B00004SCX6|2.0|I've been reading many of the reviews and I appreciate the difficulty of writing an unbiased one.  But I'll try anyway.  The fact that Britney does not write her own songs does not bother me as much as her blatant use of  sex appeal to gather an audience for her superficial songs.  I'm strongly  inclined to believe that her music video of Oops...I did it again played a  strong role in promoting her newest album.  I'm not saying that sex appeal  is wrong; on the contrary, many notable artists are able to use it  skillfully to add color to their more sensuous song.  But seeing someone as  young as Britney attempting to reach out to a male audience by using  premature sexuality with her tongue and body language is just disgusting.
B00004TDTO|4.0|THe EXTRAS on the DVD are all available on the Laser Disc Special Edition of the movie, so if you are expecting something new, forget it.  I think they could have at least addes commentary on an alternate audio track.  How hard is that?  You sit Spielberg and maybe one other person (WILLIAMS would  be my choice) in a room together, let them watch the movie and record what  they say.   Still, this is a fantastic DVD.  I noticed sounds that I had  never noticed before --like the bubbles during the opening underwater  credits.  Still well worth it! (BTW --WHy are there NO Coming Attractions  previews for JAWS on the DVD?  They had all the spots and commercials on  the Laser Disc!)
1570429596|5.0|After reading many of the less than glowing reviews I see that some people still don't &quot;get it&quot;.  I have read many self-improvement books, this one really is one of the finest. I will read it over and over, and I  will send copies to all my children.  I only wish I had read it 20 years  ago.
B0000042MY|4.0|Having just recently purchased the soundtrack CD after loving this film for several years, I was very happy with the soundtrack. I appreciate that the two composers' works are separated...the listener is able to feel the  differences in their musical styles, and realize how integral each of their  selections were to the film. As for some of the pieces being omitted or  shortened, I did not find the overall effect to be lacking. All of the  selections are beautiful; my favorites are &quot;The Glade Part II&quot;,  &quot;Promentory&quot;, &quot;The Courier&quot;, &quot;Cora&quot; and  &quot;The British Arrival.&quot; I would recommend this CD to  everyone...not just those who love the film.
B00000D9TK|5.0|This CD has inspired me to do things that I never thought possible.  The song &quot;Papillon&quot; for example is French for butterfly, it contains a lot of very interesting music patterns which make it the most enjoyable  to listen to.  Celine Dion has a wonderful voice, and I hope that you buy  this CD.  J'aime tout le monde!  C'est la vie!
6305858764|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley is the story of a poor young man in New York, Tom Ripley who is sent to Italy by a ship building tycoon to bring his son, Dickie Greenleaf, home. When Tom arrives however, he starts to fall in love  with Dickie's lifestyle, and with Dickie himself. ( Despite the fact that  Dickie has a fiancee, Marg Sherwood. ) Tom is soon accepted into their  world, but when his ride in their life is approaching an end, a desperate  and scared Tom turns to murder and deception. The Talented Mr. Ripley has  become one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it, I was  disappointed at the lack of mystery, it was not until later that I  understood the main objective of the film, to create a suspenseful drama  about lonliness and closeted homosexuality in the 1950s. Matt Damon makes  you feel the true depression and pain that is at the heart of Tom Ripley.  Since the story is told through his eyes, you start to be influenced by  him, and do not want him to lose. He is more of an accidental bad guy,  someone who you feel for and connect to. The supporting cast is for the  most part incredible, including one heart-pounding performance by the  always sensual and beyond outstanding Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf. Phillip  Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett take everything that their characters  could possibly feel and let you see it. The screenplay seems to flow  perfectly from the actors mouthes. The setting and directing are truly  brilliant, making Anthony Minghella a director to remember. It is filled  with enough sound, emotion, plot and scenary for a dozen films. The only  change I would have liked in the movie, is the casting of Marg, who ended  up being played by Gwyneth Paltrow, a highly untalented overrated and  annoying actress who failed to grasp any speck of hope that her character  had. All in all, the movie is spectacular and not to missed for anything.
B00001SIES|5.0|I bought this album after hearing them being comepared favourably in Rolling Stone Magazine to my favourite band of all time, Radiohead, and I wasn't dissappointed. If you like Radiohead, Get This! Muse may sound  similar to them because of the vocals and the atmospheric sound, but are  also origional in there own way, using latin arrangements on songs like  &quot;Muscle Museum&quot; and &quot;Uno&quot; and excellent piano playing  on &quot;Sunburn&quot;. I'ts been a long three years waiting for a new  Radiohead release, but this is the next best thing.
0451196716|5.0|When you think about it, the whole plot behind The Long Walk is both horrifying and ludicrous.  But once you sit down and become involved with the story, and the characters in it, it turns out to be one of Stephen  King's best books.  Many would think that the whole concept of the book to  be boring.  But it's not.  I was never bored during one point of The Long  Walk.  King writes at a steady pace, and the novel ends up being a quick  and easy read.  We read along, waiting to see who will get it next, and how  it will happen.  Sure, you know that it's going to happen to your favorite  character, but you wish that it won't, so you keep reading along.  A  surprising hit from Stephen King, that was written unders his alias Richard  Bachman.  Read the novel, and you'll know why!
1567184855|5.0|This book is an amazing way to solve all the questions that have never been answered.  If everyone could read this book, the world would be a much different place. There are so many people alive today that have so many  questions, if only one of them find this book in their lifetime, I bet you  they would be just that much happier.<br />When I read this book I half  expected it to try and snow me with opinions, cloud my judgement, and  confuse me until I wasn't sure what I was reading.  Much to my amazement,  that was completely the opposite. I was so into this book, I just couldn't  put it down.  He offers you the facts, nothing more, nothing less; and lets  you make whatever decision you want to about it.  It's almost as if he  says, &quot;Hey look, this is what I did, this is what they say, you make  the decision.&quot; <br />This book did more than fill my time, it filled a  part of my life. It sounds goofy I know, but it's true. I know what I  believe. I don't pretend to defend it to anyone else, and honestly there  are some things that I don't know why I believe them, but that they are  right to me. This book filled in those gaps. It gave a reason to my rhyme,  and I'm very greatful for it.
6305181772|5.0|It's strange, but most reviews tend to compare this movie to the TV-series. This isn't wrong, however, since it's based on the TV-series, but you can't really judge this movie by comparing it to the series. Some  reviews are simply about hardcore MI-fans who give it one star because they  believe this movie isn't like the series one bit, and some work the other  way around. Five stars because they believe it's exactly like the series.  Give it a rest people!<br />This movie has the excitement and the thrills  every good action movie should have, but very few reach this level. Sadly,  I might add. The movie builds towards the ending, and then it peaks, and  boy does it peak! My hair starts to crawl when the Mission: Impossible  theme starts when they're fighting on the train, and I don't have lice..  :)<br />Jean Reno is excellent as always. Jon Voight can't do anything but  deliver. Tom Cruise is as cool as can be expected, and Ving Rhames.. Well..  He's the man, as usual. Don't miss this great action/thriller, and don't  listen to the people who complain about it. The story is not THAT  complicated, if you really watch the movie. And please, do.
B000003CKH|5.0|Too often you buy a cd because you like one or two songs on it, only to find out that those are the ONLY songs you like. I've listened to this cd 5 times in a row, and have yet to find a song I didn't like. If you like cake  at all, buy this album!
B00004SST6|4.0|I have been a big fan of G. Benson's guitar playing since hearing some of his early jazz work in the 60's but have been disappointed with much of his light jazz work since then. It's great to hear him focusing on his  instrumental playing again. Although I'd still love to hear him return to a  more straight ahead jazz format, this album was a pleasant surprise.
0156421178|5.0|At a minimum, it should be required background for any class in which Animal Farm or 1984 are taught.  I'm quite serious.<br />Orwell's first-hand experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and the in-fighting on the Loyalist  side, led him to form the views of the man who wrote the more famous works  of fiction.  However, those who read only Orwell's fiction tend to see only  a condemnation of Communism (which is, at least in this country, too  readily equated with socalism).  They go away with a completely distorted  view of the meaning of those stories, and of Orwell's perception on  life.<br />Homage to Catalonia is the truth behind the fiction.  Read it.
B000023X9W|5.0|I discovered Neil Young in the late 70's. I have loved him ever since. I have lots of his tapes but I think this is one of the BEST. Every song on it is great. They all have something to say. The music is excellent  especially the harmonica sections. This is a must for any Neil Young fan.
0894803123|5.0|This is a fantastic book on making ice cream.  The recipes are great, and they even tell you a bit about the science in making ice cream.  They even give you ideas on how to create your own special flavor.  Also included are  good recipes for other desserts.  If you want to make ice cream go with the  folks that really know how to make ice cream.
630587493X|5.0|I bought this movie after much soul searching and with much trepidation. I get a bit tired of the frantic type of comedy embraced by Robin Williams, and others like Jim Carrey. Boy, was I surprised.<br />This is a fine, quiet,  thoughtful movie with a feel-good quality I haven't seen in many recent  movies. There is nothing in the movie that harkens back to any prior Robin  Williams movie except maybe &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, Good Will  Hunting&quot;, or &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;.<br />Williams role as the  android robot, Andrew, is understated and very engaging. And the supporting  cast is stellar, just right for this movie. I feel sorry for all the people  who missed this one at the theaters. Now they all have a chance, like me,  to view it again and again.
B000002C1W|5.0|A Momentary Lapse of Reason seems to have a fair amount of infamy among diehard Pink Floyd fans.  I can't argue with that; I don't own Dark Side, The Wall or Meddle and I lack the comparative perspective or the sense of  what Roger Waters brought to the group.  I like this album solely on the  basis of what it is by itself - not in comparison to earlier or later  works.<br />There are a few tracks I dislike, or at least don't pay much  attention to.  I would agree with others that Dogs of War isn't very  interesting.  A New Machine is just plain weird.  But those are the only  ones I rate short of excellent.<br />One Slip is a breathtaking and versatile  piece with inspired lyrics.  Terminal Frost is quite simply my favorite  instrumental - ever.  It is amazing and powerful.  Another Movie and Sorrow  are both excellent and deeply thoughtful.  On the Turning Away and Learning  to Fly are both quite good as well - worthy of their hit status.<br />I  recommend this album to anyone - fan of Pink Floyd or not.  It has some  excellent tracks on it, regardless of whether it sounds like prior entries  by the group.
0517122707|5.0|This book is quite simply a comic masterpiece, a novel brimming with original characters, absurd situations, and at its heart a blustery, vulnerable mama's boy named Ignatius J. Reilly. He is one of the most  startlingly original characters in modern fiction, and his efforts at  hitting the job market after his mother smashes their car will leave you in  stitches.<br />A word on the history of the novel is worth mentioning here.   The author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide in 1969, and his mother  found the hand-written manuscript in her son's papers.  She brought them to  a publisher, who dreaded having to read even a portion of the work and to  notify Toole's mother that it stunk.  Instead, he was blown away by Toole's  draft, and the rest is history.  The novel earned him a posthumous Pulitzer  Prize, and it is universally hailed by critics.<br />Trying to summarize the  plot is impossible - the book cannot really be categorized.  Ignatius is an  over-educated  oaf who stays home filling his writing tablets full of his  offbeat musings on ancient history, which he plans to organize and publish  some day but which presently reside all over his bedroom floor. Rome wasn't  built in a day he reminds himself.  He cites in footnotes, as authority for  some of his offbeat opinions, papers he had previously written and  hand-delivered to the local university library for inclusion into their  archives.  He watches dreadful tv shows and movies, howling at the screen  with a mixture of delight and loathing at the teenybopper drivel, and in  the privacy of his room his self-gratification is performed while imagining  visions of the old family dog. And wait til you see him out in public,  getting a series of odd jobs, including a filing clerk at Levy Pants (with  very innovative filing techniques to avoid crowded file space) as well as a  costumed hot dog vendor wandering around the French Quarter in a pirate  costume. All the while he begins work on his latest opus, The Journal of  the Working Boy.<br />There is a latent sadness to the plot, for while you are  laughing out loud at Ignatius, his bowling-addicted mother, and the motley  crew of skillfully drawn supporting characters, you sense that he will  never really belong anywhere, and that he realizes his outcast status with  his innate intelligence. Perhaps the author felt the same way in 1969,  leading to his own suicide.  <br />However, at least Toole did leave us A  Confederacy of Dunces, a novel which reveals more with each rereading.   Keep it on your shelf, and every now and then pick up the book to any page  and marvel at the absurdity of Ignatius's grandiose ramblings, read exerpts  of his bizarre historical writings, and revisit his comic efforts to  organize a worker's revolt at Levy Pants. The list goes on and on. There is  no work of litereature like it I know, and my only regret in reading Toole  is the sorrow felt in knowing the tremendous body of work that was lost  when he ended his life.
630018403X|5.0|I saw 'The Breakfast Club' in my sophomore English class because my teacher wanted us to watch this movie. 'The Breakfast Club' is about a group of high school students (during the '80s) who all end up at Saturday  detention, each for a different reason. The students at the beginning, of  course, absolutely HATE each other - they can't STAND each other! But then  they learn to appreciate each other as the day goes by. They start to  appreciate each other when they each tell why they were in Saturday  dentention, and become friends in the end.<br />I like how they have a cast of  completely different characters: a jock, a princess, a nerd, a weirdo, and  a metalhead. They actually seem like realistic characters - and some of the  stories they tell are heartwarming and devastating. All in all, good  acting; fantastic plot; and a great cast. There's also a really important  moral to be learned when watching this movie. If you listen very closely,  you'll be able to catch it. This is a great movie. You don't even have to  be in high school to enjoy it. I really recommend it!
0783240236|5.0|First of all, &quot;The Birds&quot; is a brilliant example of the sci-fi genre, because it explores new possibilities for the human experience: Rockets and moon trips do not always fit in as a rule... it's a simple  matter of questions.  Hitchcock never embraced openly the supernatural  aspect of &quot;The Birds&quot;, he merely denied the old fashioned  cotidianity of our own logical worlds. (And if Hitchcock ever succumbed to  an openly fantastic detail, as in the final sequence of &quot;Family  Plot&quot;, that introduction was clearly with the director's tongue firmly  planted in his cheek... ) New disposition of variables conform a whole  different logic. Supernaturalism in &quot;The Birds&quot; is a trivial  response because there should always be an excuse in Hitchcock's movies (a  simple motif, like the confusion of characters in &quot;North By  Northwest&quot;), just like chance or hazard are constants in Luis Buñuel:  there must be a story to tell, first of all, and it never must cause any  boredom.  With the confidence of a great master, the movie-making in  &quot;The Birds&quot; is quite simple (open and closed shots; natural  sound; always with the angle of the camera in the right place) and subtle.  Classic movie making. Elegantly, the movie opens with a comic scenario that  involves us within the lives of plain romantic somebodies.  Sure, we're  expecting the birds to attack at any minute, so why is Hitchcock bothering  with all the romantic knot? It is a golden rule, that silent comedians  followed early on, that a screenplay should not begin with a spectacular  display. Showing exact timing, Hitchcock breaks into the lives of the  people in California, through the attack of the birds, and realism  surfaces.  The main distance between the director of &quot;The Birds&quot;  and a montage filmmaker (just like  Brian De Palma, who who had achieved  the status of a suspense auteur), is that a montage fillmaker relies in  images and sounds that can be manipulated after the shooting. Hitchcock  never bothered with all that new wave stuff, he merely filmed exactly what  he wanted and left very little to improvisation... and yet &quot;The  Birds&quot; never lacks humor, romance nor a glimpse of sadness (which,  just about 99 percent of today's thrillers simply do not compress.) The  relationships between the women in this movie are so well constructed and  performed (the looks in their eyes; the silences; the faked smiles), that  could have sustained the whole story without any of the animal fierceness.  <br />Hitchcock could have done (in his own way, with his own generic means)  just about anything.
0312243022|5.0|Cunningham's style is so poignant and straightforward that he needs only a few words to describe truth and character in a complex story. He deftly ties in the creativity of Virginia Woolf, and reminds all of us passionate  readers why it is we love to read so much. If you are interested in how  people's lives touch one another and how creative thought is the one of the  best vehicles for that contact, read this book.

B0000020C4|5.0|its true.. the dream cast ever.. Lea reinvented the role of Eponine.. she has a stunning voice.. her role is not a leadstar but its worth remembering..  I love the way she utters &quot;Marius&quot; the  &quot;river&quot; and noone can reach as high as hers in the  &quot;blind&quot; of ON MY OWN. Frances is way too nasal which I could  hardly understand. The only flaw of Lea was her acting.. well come to think  of it.. this is more on singing than acting.. its a concert.. Judy Khun.. i  dont know.. she has bigger role than Lea but somehow the latter has the big  effect on the concert..  Marius hes cute.. hes voice is good.. but i dont  like him smiling during the sad moments..  lack of acting.. well.. like I  said.. this is more on singing than acting.. this CD is worth having .. get  also the video tape..
B000002J1U|4.0|After they had already put out 2 amazing albums, people were questioning Led Zep as to why they wanted to push their luck with another album. I think that they did an excellent job of silencing the critics. This album  is not as good as the first two, but that doesn't make it bad. It is a  temporary change for them. Things get started off with &quot;Immigrant  Song.&quot; It is an okay song. It is not as good as their other two first  songs. &quot;Friends&quot; makes up for it. Not only does it deliver a good  message, but it is musically great. &quot;Celebration Day&quot; has an  excellent riff. Of course, most Zep songs do. This is a good song.  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is the greatest blues track ever  recorded by Led Zeppelin. Not to mention it is the greatest song on the  album. If you are wearing headphones or have the volume up loud, you can  hear Bonzo's bass pedal squeak throughout the song. It is especially  evident in the introduction. &quot; Out on the Tiles&quot; rocks. I can't  make it more clear than that. After &quot;Gallow's Pole&quot; I lose  interest in the album. That is the reason for subtracting one star.  &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;That's the Way&quot; are good on some days.  The last two I have never liked. Even with that in mind, do not refrain  from buying this album.
B000002N2N|5.0|The Ramones had many great studio albums...but every Ramones fan knows that the Ramones were about the Live Show.  This album, more so then any other Ramones album, captures what they were all about.  Anyone can listen  to their studio albums, but without experiencing them live, you never  really &quot;know&quot; the band.  Now that they have retired, this may be  the best bet you have at hearing the band live.  They recorded other live  albums but this is clearly the best of them all.  A must for Ramones fans.
B000002J0B|5.0|Following LZ IV could not have been an easy task. Although, this is about as good as they could have done. &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; is an excellent way to kick off the album. Even from the very beginning of  this song, you are hooked. Things slow down a bit with &quot;The Rain  Song.&quot; This is probably the best song on the album. The Mellotron is  what makes it sound like there is a symphony with them. &quot;Over the  Hills and Far Away&quot; sounds like another mellow song from the  beginning. Then, it just explodes. If not &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, this  is the best on the album. &quot;The Crunge&quot; is one of the few Zep  songs that I dislike. &quot;Dancing Days&quot; makes up for it. I am sure  that you have heard &quot;D'yer Mak'er. Bonzo does a great job on the  drums.(as usual) &quot;No Quarter&quot;, despite what others say, is a  great song. Especially the version on &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;  soundtrack. JPJ does an excellent job on the piano. &quot;The Ocean&quot;  closes it. An excellent song that doesn't fail to rock you. The end solo is  awesome. This is an excellent album, buy it.
079072961X|4.0|This seems like a movie that is ripe for a special edition DVD. This DVD has no extras, not even a trailer, other than some notes on the insert. DVD collectors may want to wait for a special edition unless you absolutely  have to have this in your collection.
B000002JSN|5.0|Of all of Led Zeppelin's studio albums, this is the most musically diverse. Ranging from pure heavy metal (Custard Pie) to epics (Kashmir) to acoustic blues(Black Country Woman). Robert Plant says that this album  captures the essence of Led Zeppelin better than any other. Musically, this  is their finest moment. We all know that Robert Plant oozed sexuality more  than any other artist. (maybe Jim Morrison ) This is especially evident in  the opening track &quot;Custard Pie.&quot; It is an excellent way to start  off the album. &quot;The Rover&quot; is a great, and very underrated, song.  This song has everything. &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; is Led Zep's  longest studio version of any song. Clocking in at 11:04, you will be into  it the whole way. &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is a great song. This is  another song where, if you listen closely, you can hear Bonzo's bass pedal  squeaking throughout the song. &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot; has John Paul  Jones at his finest. His keyboard solo will blow you away. The first disc  wraps up with &quot;Kasmir.&quot; There is no doubt that this song is among  Led Zeppelin's best. Jimmy Page believes that this song has them at their  best as a group. &quot;In the Light&quot; kicks off the second album. It  does a good job of it too. &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur is a Jimmy Page song. He does  an excellent job with this one, as he does with every song. &quot;Down by  the Seaside&quot; starts out mellow, but by the end, it has done it's fair  share of rocking. &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, with the exception of  &quot;Kasmir&quot; is the greatest song on the album. &quot;Night  Flight&quot; is a short, yet powerful, song. The last four songs don't  stack up to the others on the album although they are still good songs. You  will not regret buying this album. It is a good album to buy to introduce  yourself to Led Zep.

B000002J09|5.0|At this point in their career, people knew that they would be around for awhile. I don't think they ever expected anything like this though. We get started with &quot;Black Dog.&quot; Even though it has been grossly  overplayed on radio stations, it is still awesome. The end solo by Jimmy  Page is great as well. &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; is exactly that. This is  among Led Zeppelin's best songs. Everybody in the band delivers an awesome  performance. From Robert Plant's screams to Bonzo's introduction and end  solo. &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; seems to be criticized a lot. I  love it. Then, everything in music leads up to this point. You hear the  mystical riff of &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; All of the hype of this  song is well deserved. It is the best song EVER. I could not believe when  it was number 3 behind &quot;Respect,&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; on  VH1's Greatest Songs Of Rock. The solo is the best ever. John Paul Jones  gives it the heavenly (no pun intended) sound with his keyboard playing. It  has Percy's voice among the best it has ever been. Even though it takes  over 4 minutes for Bonzo to enter the picture, he still delivers. After the  solo, it features Led Zeppelin at the pinnacle of rock. Listen to the  lyrics, they are inspiring.This is also the only song that gives me chills  every time I hear it. I feel sorry for &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; to be  placed where it is. It is hard to follow the best ever. It is still a good  song. It features JPJ on the keyboards and he does a good job. &quot;Four  Sticks&quot; is the only song on the album that is fair. But hey, fair is  still good. &quot;Going to California&quot; is a great song. The version on  BBS Sessions is better though. &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is an  awesome way to finish the album. My fav thing about this song is that it  has Percy's possible best scream. He has some good screaming, but at the  part, &quot;Don't it make you feel bad...&quot; his voice is just so  powerful. This is possibly the best album ever. Maybe behind &quot;Dark  Side of the Moon.&quot; BUY THIS ALBUM!

0553275976|1.0|Tom Wolfe's reputation as a good writer is one of those things that escapes me, rather like the appeal of figure-skating and the music of Dean Friedman.  His fans claim him for a dazzlingly witty writer and an inventor  of a whole new style of journalism - which style seems to me to be a  pathological delusion that we are more interested in him than in what he  writes about.  His book on architecture is farcically shallow, and his  major contribution to 20th century prose style seems to be the introduction  of multiple exclamation marks to signify when he's being funny.<br />So, no, I  don't like him.  Skip to the last paragraph if you feel you've heard enough  of my opinion.  The Bonfire of the Vanities was a major publishing event,  as it was Wolfe's first venture into fiction; he had claimed for years that  contemporary fiction writers had abandoned the idea that fiction had  anything to say about the real world, ignoring the fact that a really  _good_ novel like Pynchon's &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; is chock-full of  information about military technology, the complicity of America in  colluding with Nazi science (hiring the borderline war criminal Werner von  Braun to work on the space program, for example) and historical examples of  genocide.  Hence, he turned out this galumphing &quot;satire&quot; in which  a yuppie is prosecuted for knocking down a black man in his car.  Wow.   Like, daring.  Bret Easton Ellis' &quot;American Psycho&quot; was a far  more visceral registration of 80s greed than Wolfe had the nerve to dream  up.  The best thing about this book is that it gave rise to a very bad but  far more entertaining movie.<br />You may be interested to know that National  Alliance, an extreme right-wing group devoted to raising the consciousness  of the white race, list this book on their website as recommended reading,  along with &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and the works of Alfred  Rosenberg.  You can even buy it from their online bookshop (National  Vanguard Books).  I'm sure Mr. Wolfe would not be happy to learn this, but  if he were a better writer they wouldn't have found so much in his work to  admire.  Just thought it was worth pointing out.
0395595118|5.0|I was so amazed at how magnificent the books really were! The plot was so wonderful, and the characters were so well put together and I have not in all my life have read a trilogy of books as brilliant as the Lord of the  rings this is probably the greatest achievement in literature in the world.  JRR Tolkien is one of the most    brilliant authors of all time and I  advise young adults and adults to buy this collection of books. These books  are truly the greatest books ever written!
6305810109|5.0|I must admit, when I heard the premise for this film--David Lynch does a movie about a guy who drives a lawnmower hundreds of miles to visit sick brother, I thought, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  However, this movie is just  terrific.  David Lynch still has the knack for catching the weirdness of  life on film, it's just that in the Straight Story, he does it in a  non-shocking way.  The cinematography is wonderful, as you would expect  with a Lynch film and the acting is particularly strong.  These actors are  not beautiful Hollywood stars, but average looking people with lots of  talent.  The story, as Lynch tells it is heartwarming without being hokey  at all, it's funny, yet remains true to the story.  Richard Farnsworth is a  masterful actor who with one single silent expression can convey a wealth  of emotion.<br />See this movie now, you won't regret it.  Highly recommended.
B000001F7R|5.0|Many people say On Through The Night is completely different from later Def Leppard albums.  In one sense it is, but on this album I really do hear signs of what's soon to come.  Some of these songs manage to be very  catchy, and we all know where their pop sensibilities would take the band  later on.  So here's my song-by-song review of Def Leppard's On Through The  Night:<br />Rock Brigade - A rocker that has a great riff and a simple, but  catchy chorus.  A very likeable song even to those who only know  Hysteria-era Lep.<br />Hello America - The second single.  A little bit  lighter than Rock Brigade but with all its positives - especially the  simple, but catchy chorus.  This song foreshadows the pop-metal that would  bring them major success.<br />Sorrow Is A Woman - A dark half-ballad (like  Pyromania's Too Late For Love).  I say half-ballad because while the verses  ARE typical ballad, some parts do rock and there are two solos.<br />It Could  Be You - A rocker that opens with a wail from Joe that's very similar to  Robert Plant's in Immigrant Song.  Now that I think about it, the whole  song is similar to Immigrant song (even the length), except that it has a  distinctive chorus.<br />Satellite - Mid-tempo rocker that could have been a  single if the chorus was stronger.  Everything about the verses is  excellent, though, and there is an interesting solo.<br />When The Walls Came  Tumbling Down - Lyrically deals with the apocalypse, and the first verse is  spoken.  Still a very interesting rocker with a nice solo.  And of course,  at the end, we hear the walls tumbling down.<br />Wasted - The first single.   A cool riff and the only song from On Through The Night played on the  Euphoria tour (even if it was only once in Japan!).<br />Rocks Off - Starts  out with fake audience applause and a very cool riff.  This song is Def  Leppard at their subtlest (HA! ).  The bad production really stands out  about two thirds of the way into this song when the guitar switches back  and forth between the left and right channels.  UGH! <br />It Don't Matter - A  strange turn of events in that the chorus is better than the verse.  One of  the weaker songs on the album, but far from bad.<br />Answer To The Master -  Probably the weakest song on the album, but it features a short drum solo  from Rick Allen!  The guitar solo, however, is probably the best part of  the song.  Why did this song get picked over Good Morning Freedom (a strong  B-Side from the Hello America single) or even Heat Street (never officially  released)?<br />Overture - Ah, yes.  The epic.  Overture has an (extended)  acoustic intro and outro.  When the song finally kicks into gear, it  becomes a little more enjoyable.  This song really does rock, and it really  could've been called When The Walls Came Tumbling Down Part II.<br />So there  you have it.  On Through The Night is definitely the heaviest Leppard  album, and the production is not that great.  But I don't see why it can't  be enjoyed by those who only own Hysteria or Vault.  This album deserves a  place in every Def Leppard fan's collection.

B00004TH83|5.0|I have to admit that I purchased this CD on the assumption that it was going to be some kind of upbeat, dany disco-teque type album with the occasional ballad.  I had heard &quot;I Will Love Again&quot; and fell  deeply in love with it.  But when I listened to it the first time, it  totally blew me away!  I would have sworn I had picked up a Celine Dion  album by mistake.  She sounds so similar, and yet she has her own voice.   She is truly amazing.  I am already waiting for her next album!  Adagio is  so moving, and Not From here is so emotional, as are all the songs.  It's a  great easy listening CD and one of those Rainy Day Albums.  She is so  magnificent!  If you're suffering from the hiatus of Celine Dion for her  pregnancy, Lara Fabian is just what you're looking for.  She's everything  that you don't think she'll be!  This album is so great!  You will not  regret this buy ever!
B00000J7J4|1.0|I fell for the hype and I have regretted it. If you want to listen to Carlo's sublime riffs you are much better off listening to his old albums. The lyrics on this one (although not by the &quot;icon&quot; himself - he  just cashes in big time ..) make me think of either some guy that never got  off the LSD trip he took once back in the 70's or of someone who suddenly  found out he suffers from an incurable disease and - too late - decides  that life is all about love and light and &quot;Whoo-aohaha hey lala&quot;  (yes they sing this ..) - It's simply too much ...

6304712936|5.0|Mozart is arguably the best classical composer ever in history.  Mendelssohn is said to come close, but realistically, that isn't true.  There was never anyone like Mozart.  A PURE musical genius, actually able  to finish entire operas in his head before he wrote them down and without a  single error in his manuscript.<br />Actually, you may think this movie is  largely fictional, but if you research Mozart's life, you will find that  the movie is largely based on fact.  Not all of it, but most of  it.<br />Mozart did have a horrid mouth, The Magic Flute was composed in the  small house where he was wined and dined (they show the house in the  movie), etc.  Some of the historical stuff was completely ignored like  Mozart's appointment as the Court Composer, the Emporer's loss of power and  fall, etc.  How about Mozart's dominance of the piano and thanks to Mozart,  the clarinet is a permanent fixture in today's orchestra.<br />But with all  the factual flaws, Amadeus is a wonderful movie and is deserving of it's  Best Picture award and others.<br />The DVD has the movie on 2 sides.  The  video and audio transfer are excellent and the extra features are quite  slim.  But it was an earlier release when DVDs were new.  It would be  beneficial to make a new DVD of this and re-release it adding all the  extras that are found on today's DVDs.
0064471047|5.0|I remember back when I was in second grade and I read The Loin The Witch and the Wardrobe. I wasn't really used to something this long but I immeaditally fell in love with it. The Story of Lucy, Peter, Susan and  Edmund is an imaginative adventure of Narnia. WHen Lucy finds a door into  another world called Narnia she befriends a faun and enjoys herself very  much. But no one will believe her! ANd when she convinces then to come they  find them self traveling to find Aslan, the great lion, and running from  the white witch's powerful wrath. I'm 15 now and going to be a softmore and  I still love this book. Everyone should read it.
B000001DVD|5.0|High N' Dry is the forgotten Def Leppard CD. Most people immediately skip to Pyromania because that's when the band broke big. But High N' Dry is an amazing hard rock CD with top notch songs. Not only does it have Lep  standard &quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot;, but the title track, Let  it Go, Another Hit and Run (possibly my favorite Lep song of all), Switch  625 and You Got Me Runnin'. It's a shame the Leps don't play more of these  songs in concert. During the Slang tour they played them and the place was  rockin'.  I never grow tired of High 'N Dry. It's heavier than Pyromania,  less produced than Hysteria, and that means it's pure, hard rockin' Def  Leppard. Don't miss this one.
B00000IPAX|5.0|When I first heard Blink 182 with &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot;, I knew I would love them. All of the tracks on the CD are great, without sounding the same. You can just listen to the entire thing without having to press  the skip button once. No matter how old you are, or what kind of music you  like, I guarantee you will get a kick out of Enema of the State, so buy it  now!
B0000033OZ|5.0|This is the album that intoduced ELP to the world. Listening to it takes one back to the early, heady, synth-drenched days of the progressive rock era...before the critics (largely out of their own ignorance) decided en  masse to label this wonderfully intellectual music as  &quot;pretentious&quot;, etc., simply because it wasn't suitablty  &quot;dumbed down&quot; for them. When EMERSON, LAKE AND PALMER was  released, both the prog genre in general and the band in particular were  something new...and this album brims forth with freshness, enthusiasm,  technical prowess, and the flair for showmanship that would continue to  distinguish ELPs later work.<br />This record literally changed the face of FM  rock.  Several of the tracks, including &quot;Take a Pebble&quot;,  &quot;The Three Fates&quot; and of course &quot;Lucky Man&quot; became  album rock staples, and the music's daring showed the way to a new  synthesis between rock and everything else that came before it.  Highly  recommended.
B00000JCB2|5.0|There's something about Significant Other that just seperates it from the rest of their songs and compilations... and other artists at that.<br />Maybe it's the smooth stylings of &quot;rearranged&quot; that almost seem to calm  things down a bit, or the in-your-face lyrics in &quot;break stuff&quot;.  <br />I have still yet to find a bad song on this CD. I'm not a huge fan of  Fred Durst (Limp lead singer), but I think he may have outdone himself with  this album.<br />Their debut album, 3 Dollar Bill, seemed to have left me in  the dust. Produced by Ross Robinson, it had quite a distorted sound and it  was maybe 3 stars being generous.<br />This is basically nothing like that.  The songs are interesting, some in-your-face, others not. N 2 Gether Now,  where Bizkit teamed up with the Method Man, was quite an interesting song  too, altough not totally my favorite.<br />However, this album seems to  redefine the band's name. Although many say that they have &quot;gone  soft&quot; with this album, I don't. I think that they've gone  &quot;quality&quot;.<br />My favorite songs include &quot;Just Like  This&quot;, &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, and &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot;. <br />And  by the way, we didn't do it all for the &quot;NOOKIE&quot;, that song has  worn out it's welcome.
6305657947|3.0|This movie starts out with a very cool premise.  I enjoyed the first few scenes of the movie, but as the &quot;plot&quot; went on and the movie progressed it got more and more borring.  Up until a fairly neat sequence  at the end that was rather surprising and a tad silly.  The borring middle  was not helped by Pierce's continual mumbling.  I'll say again that this  movie has some neat sections, but at times it was so borring I got up to go  do the dishes.  I would rent it, but not buy it.
6302518423|4.0|When I first saw this film, I was projecting it for a college crowd of maybe 300+ on a Friday night.  By the end of the film, I would say that  maybe 50 people were still remaining.  Evidently, as with most of Peter  Greenaway's films, this is not an easy film to watch.  It just barely makes  any sense, and unless the viewer has read the text of Shakespeare's  &quot;The Tempest&quot; prior to seeing this film, he will become  thoroughly lost and confused very quickly.<br />That being said, this is still  quite a fascinating film to look at.  The cinematography and montage of  colorful images that comprise this film give it a magical, other-worldly  appearance.  There is really only one character in the movie - Prospero, as  played by Sir John Gielgud.  He is the narrator, the active player around  which the movie revolves; everyone else plays essentially non-speaking  support roles.  The movie appears as though we are watching Prospero's  dream of &quot;The Tempest&quot; as he follows us through his dream and  narrates the plot.  The narration, however, is difficult to follow unless  the viewer knows the play (as previously stated).<br />Admirers of Greenaway's  films will probably enjoy this film for its visual content and  iconoclastic, stylish approach.  I liked this film, though I feel I must  have burnt out half my brain cells concentrating enough on the film to keep  up with the plot.  Those seeking a more conventional telling of the Bard's  plays might do well to watch an Olivier or Branagh production instead.
0792156684|5.0|Titanic is first of all of love story, but it is so much more than that. Titanic is by far the best picture I have ever seen. What makes Titanic so great, mainly three things.<br />The fist is the bold exploration into the  world of the past.  Along with a great love story we see the history of a  wonderful ship. The people on board with but one dream, America. One scene  I really enjoy is when jack wins the poker match and screems &quot;We're  going to America&quot;.<br />The second is the script.  I have never heard  dialogue between two characters so beautiful. One dialogue that always  stuck out in my mind is when rose declares &quot;You have a gift Jack you  see people.&quot; and Jack romanitcally replys &quot;I see you.&quot; what  a wonderful peice of dialogue.<br />The third reason the film is the greatest  is the soundtrack. The music fits the film perfectly. It brings thoughts of  passion, happiness, and disaster into one's mind.<br />Titanic is the greatest  film ever.  Buy it today.
0380973464|5.0|*Cryptonomicon* was absolutely superb. Incredibly, Neal Stephenson's skills have grown since writing *Diamond Age*. His prose is so inventive and image-provoking that I re-read passages multiple times just to savor  the language. I had to interrupt my wife numerous times to read parts to  her, just to spread the enjoyment. Despite the length of the book, I didn't  want it to end.      Others have commented on the likelihood that  non-technical readers might have a difficult time with the mathematical  descriptions of cryptanalysis. I disagree. Most readers of the book are  fairly sophisticated anyway, and should have no trouble if they otherwise  enjoy the book.      I can't wait for Mr. Stephenson's next effort. One  point of correction-- the Skunk River doesn't go as far North as Ames, IA.    ;)
0783240236|5.0|First of all, &quot;The Birds&quot; is a brilliant example of the sci-fi genre, because it explores new possibilities for the human experience: Rockets and moon trips do not always fit in as a rule... it's a simple  matter of questions.  Hitchcock never embraced openly the supernatural  aspect of &quot;The Birds&quot;, he merely denied the old fashioned  cotidianity of our own logical worlds. (And if Hitchcock ever succumbed to  an openly fantastic detail, as in the final sequence of &quot;Family  Plot&quot;, that introduction was clearly with the director's tongue firmly  planted in his cheek... ) New disposition of variables conform a whole  different logic. Supernaturalism in &quot;The Birds&quot; is a trivial  response because there should always be an excuse in Hitchcock's movies (a  simple motif, like the confusion of characters in &quot;North By  Northwest&quot;), just like chance or hazard are constants in Luis Buñuel:  there must be a story to tell, first of all, and it never must cause any  boredom.  With the confidence of a great master, the movie-making in  &quot;The Birds&quot; is quite simple (open and closed shots; natural  sound; always with the angle of the camera in the right place) and subtle.  Classic movie making. Elegantly, the movie opens with a comic scenario that  involves us within the lives of plain romantic somebodies.  Sure, we're  expecting the birds to attack at any minute, so why is Hitchcock bothering  with all the romantic knot? It is a golden rule, that silent comedians  followed early on, that a screenplay should not begin with a spectacular  display. Showing exact timing, Hitchcock breaks into the lives of the  people in California, through the attack of the birds, and realism  surfaces.  The main distance between the director of &quot;The Birds&quot;  and a montage filmmaker (just like  Brian De Palma, who who had achieved  the status of a suspense auteur), is that a montage fillmaker relies in  images and sounds that can be manipulated after the shooting. Hitchcock  never bothered with all that new wave stuff, he merely filmed exactly what  he wanted and left very little to improvisation... and yet &quot;The  Birds&quot; never lacks humor, romance nor a glimpse of sadness (which,  just about 99 percent of today's thrillers simply do not compress.) The  relationships between the women in this movie are so well constructed and  performed (the looks in their eyes; the silences; the faked smiles), that  could have sustained the whole story without any of the animal fierceness.  <br />Hitchcock could have done (in his own way, with his own generic means)  just about anything.
B00000F14B|4.0|The previous customer reviews are going a little bit overboard on &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  Although it is one of Hollywood's musical comedy gems, it lacks a sense of good directorial pacing. Things are  overexplained, and the plot lumbers on; you don't mind this in the theatre,  but in a movie it's tiring. Songs that are fun to watch on stage get  tedious after a while on film. Still, what a pleasure to see Robert Preston  at the top of his form!  The producers of this film had the good sense to  keep the Broadway star, unlike the HUGE mistakes made by the film  &quot;Kismet&quot; in not using Alfred Drake and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;  in not using Julie Andrews.        My vote for the best song in the show is  &quot;Lida Rose,&quot; sung by the barbershop quartet.  &quot;Till There  Was You&quot; is sublime.  And the opening salesman sequence on the train  is a unique moment in Hollywood films.      While &quot;The Music Man&quot;  is high on my list of the second-best group of Hollywood musicals, it  doesn't get into the first tier for a simple reason: no great dancing.   Well-choreographed dancing is one of the special pleasures of Hollywood  musicals.         I should mention some of the musicals in my first tier,  and I'll be posting reviews of them: Singing in the Rain, The Band Wagon,  Easter Parade, Grease, Swing Time, The Red Shoes.............. Happy  viewing!
0790725657|4.0|A beautiful film with a happy ending, but the effect on parents (makes 'em cry -- a lot) may be too intense for young children.
0790749815|4.0|It is indeed an extremely enjoyable movie, and the rapid cutting at the end, leading to the erotic train going through the tunnel, is one of the most brilliant visual conceptions of all filmdom.  Yet the previous  reviewers gush too much.  As Hitchcock films go (and they go VERY FAR  INDEED) this one is at a high level, alongside &quot;To Catch a  Thief,&quot; and better than &quot;Marnie.&quot;  &quot;The Man Who Knew  Too Much&quot; (the James Stewart remake) is somewhat better, though  slower, than &quot;North by Northwest.&quot;  But none of the films  mentioned so far can compete with the sublime &quot;Vertigo,&quot; or  &quot;Rear Window.&quot;  Eva Marie Saint is OK in &quot;North by  Northwest,&quot; but oh how much better Grace Kelly would have been!  When,  oh when, are we going to get a decent DVD of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;  in 3-D? To see Ms. Kelly in three dimensions, as well as to enjoy a  Hitchcock movie that, seen in its original 3D, is even better than  &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (unless you're a scenery buff), is a need  that simply must be fulfilled by the folks who are turning out these DVDs.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|This CD has some very good songs. I especially like Lets Get Loud and Waiting for Tonight. This CD is really cool, but not all of the songs are worth listening to. If you just like one of the  hit song titles like  Waiting for Tonight, I suggested getting a single because you will be sorry  that you purchased the entire CD.
0671688782|1.0|The author continually makes unsubstantiated claims.  She quotes studies but gives absolutely no information about who did the study.  For instance, she states \\"Recent studies show that infants show signs of withdrawal after only one hour of separation from their mothers.\\" But there is NO mention of 1) who did the studies or 2)what institution did the study?  Harvard medical school?  Yo-yo U?  Where?  There isn't a single footnote in the entire book.  The author goes on to state \\"Think of how many hours the baby was away from you in the hospital nursery or even in the early months of life at home.  When constantly stressed by separations, a child eventually learns not to rely on his parents but to take comfort in whatever way he can.  As an infant he may withdraw into himself.\\" So basically every child in the western world has been damaged by frequent separations and has learned his parents can't be trusted.  I thought that was just a little bit dire.  And this is just one example of the author's sweeping generalizations. She suggests that I hold my child against his will and \\"physically force\\" him to look me in the eye yet she offers no evidence to convince me that this is a good thing to do except for anecdotes and anonymous studies. The other problem with Holding Time is that it is held out as a cure-all.  Sibling rivalry, whining, low self esteem, you name it, Holding Time is a cure for it.  I got this book off the bargain rack. I'm glad I didn't pay any more money for it.
0790751143|2.0|Kindler, gentler Dirty Harry film which puts our bureaucracy-hating,  crime-busting hero with a female partner played by Tyne Daly, who would  later achieve fame on &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; and is currently seen  on &quot;Judging Amy.&quot; Thin plot, some classic Eastwood quotes, but  the villains can't match Andy Robinson from &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; or  David Soul from &quot;Magnum Force.&quot; This might be the weakest Harry  of the bunch.
0805062971|5.0|Yes, I saw the movie first. Yes, I read about a half a book every three years. But I must say this is the best book I ever read. It offers some alternate scenarios than the movie. For example, the narrators first  meeting of Tyler, the aquisition of fat, the quiting of jobs, the working  of jobs, night car ride, the veterinary student &quot;hold up&quot; , the  Angel Face pummeling, the we have to get your b_lls confrontation, and the  much more fitting than the movie ending. There is more but one can only  recall so much. The writing style is just like the narration of the movie,  which make smooth, quick reading. Seeing the film first helped me a little  because a had a clear picture of the characters and Edwards Nortons voice  in my head. Oh no I must be crazy too! Chuck Palahniuks writing style is  very vivid and &quot;insane&quot; in a good way. This is a fairly short  book which is well worth getting enthralled into. Five and one half  stars!
0780626478|4.0|Brendan Fraser seems to specialize in `fish-out-of-water' characters, and he plays it to the hilt in this smart comedy. Fraser plays Adam Webber, the son of a Cold-War-obsessed scientist (Christopher Walken) and his wife  (Sissy Spacek) who hunker down in a fallout shelter for 35 years, when they  believe the big one has destroyed the earth. <br />In truth, a plane fell on  their house, and their now-grown son only wishes to go and see the world.  Their neighborhood has changed a lot, from quiet suburbia to punk clubs and  adult bookstores, but Adam, who only wishes to meet a nice girl, manages to  meet his match in the appropriately named Eve, nicely played by Alicia  Silverstone with the right mix of incredulousness and sweetness. Dave Foley  (The Kids in the Hall, NewsRadio) as Eve's gay roommate and Joey Slotnick  as a stoned club owner who becomes a cult leader (you'll have to see why)  are also very funny.<br />Director/writer Hugh Wilson has created a sweet,  satirical film that features romance with light, satirical humor. It also  has terrific sets (especially the Webbers' shelter) and a terrific dance  scene. Blast from the Past is a light comedy that is well worth watching.
B00000F5QE|5.0|Randy Newman at his cynical, emotional best! The interaction with the small crowd is worth the price alone. Linda Ronstadt sings &quot;Real Emotional Girl&quot; and engraves this classic Randy gem into your soul. Ry  Cooder is featured. All in all, this was the set that got me goin' on Randy  Newman's train. Probably in the top five songwriters of the post-40's  generations, Randy's never stuck in the style-o'-the-day - he paints his  own colors and bleeds his own blood without fear. &quot;Odeon&quot; is  almost 25 years old - the material is at least that old - yet you will  chuckle and cry and wish for more.  If you're a fan of songwriting and  eschew the posing commerciality of what passes for popular music, this is a  congealed example of the way things should be.  I rank him with Cole Porter  as a great American songwriter.  Check it out - as a first time listener or  an afficianado of Randy's work, this is a benchmark.
6305807043|4.0|Being John Malkovich is easily one of the most original films ever made. It's plot is twisted and difficult to explain; a financially failing puppeteer, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), works on the 7 ½ (!) floor of a  building filing papers and discovers a portal to the actor John Malkovich's  brain. His sexy, tempestuous co-worker played by Catherine Keener is along  for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both. Then there  is Schwartz's boss (Orson Bean) who also has a special interest in  Malkovich. <br />The idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of  all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation.  The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film,  and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport.  Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its  originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing. Spike Jonze  has made his directing debut that will be remembered for a long time.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 has added a great deal to punk rock with their new album, Enema of the State. Almost all of their songs deserve to be on the radio, such as Aliens Exist, Going Away to College, Don't Leave Me, and Dysentary Gary.  With their hit songs off the album already, What's My Age Again?, Adam's  Song, and All the Small Things, you've got a really great album. The only  song I don't listen to is Wendy Clear. So if you haven't already, go out  and buy a copy of Enema of the State. You won't be dissapointed.
6304504012|2.0|Musical version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1970's musical hit that showcases the life of Argentinian first lady Evita Peron. What might have worked on stage does not work here; it comes off more like an extended music  video.<br />Peron moved up the social ladder by sleeping her way to the top,  and she is an interesting character. She charmed and fascinated her people,  yet repulsed them by supporting her husband's fascist regime. Madonna sings  very well and her costumes are great (she reportedly had to change costumes  85 times!) and Antonio Banderas also sings well as Che, a sort of  narrator/voice of the people/conscience who seems to be everywhere.  Jonathan Pryce, who sang on Broadway in the original production of Miss  Saigon, does nicely as Juan Peron, who knows the power of his wife, and  knows that even in their marriage, he is not loved as much as she loves her  people.<br />As well meaning as the film is, it is simply boring. With barely  any dialogue, we are swept from one song to another without knowing these  characters as much as we should. A nice idea that would have better been  left on stage. How the film and Madonna defeated Fargo and Frances  McDormand in the Golden Globes is beyond my understanding.
6300185249|4.0|This is a very enjoyable, light-hearted flick. It features a younger, slimmer, and funnier version of Tom Hanks than the one we know from more recent politically correct or repetitious movies. His Socratic reasoning  with Shelley Long is just hilarious. Exaggeration is what makes this movie,  and every comedy that uses it, funny or funnier. So I do not see why people  criticize the film as &quot;unrealistic.&quot; This is not a documentary.   I definitely recommend this movie.
6305426694|4.0|After recently reading Jonathan Harr's book A Civil Action, I eagerly awaited seeing the movie version of this sad and absorbing story. The film version condenses the story and leaves out several interesting portions of  the book, but is fine nevertheless. John Travolta is a perfect choice to  play Jan Schlichtmann, the egotistical, free-spending attorney who dives  headfirst into a damages case against the corporate giants Beatrice and  W.R. Grace, who are accused of poisoning the drinking water of Woburn,  Massachusetts and causing a leukemia outbreak. William H. Macy, Tony  Shalhoub, and Zeljko Ivanek co-star as Schlichtmann's partners in the firm,  and one only wishes that they would have protested his actions, which led  to the financial ruin of him and his firm.<br />Robert Duvall gives another  terrific performance as Jerome Facher, Beatrice's attorney, who is the  complete opposite of Schlichtmann. In a scene at a fancy hotel conference  room, the frugal Facher is not impressed by any of the lawyers or their  arguments, but the free pen that he can take home. It's a subtly funny  scene that illustrates Facher perfectly. John Lithgow does a terrific job  as Judge Walter Skinner, who Schlichtmann believes is siding with the  enemy.<br />A Civil Action is a story where the winners and losers are  unclear, and it must have been difficult for writer-director Steven  Zaillian to condense Harr's technical-laden novel. The result is a solid  drama with powerhouse acting. Highly recommended.

B00004TLMC|2.0|As a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I had been eagerly anticipating this film. I can now say how disappointed I am. While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially  the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates.  <br />The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like  if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their  mouths.<br />Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve  no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.<br />However, as  for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating  and bizarre sequences in recent film.<br />I can't help but feel sorry for the  cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in  such a mess.
1556154844|5.0|More time spent getting the fundamentals of software development right could save industry a fortune, certainly more and switching to the latest language or develpment technique.<br />I've been developing software in  various languages for twenty years now.  In all that time I've found that  there are very few books about software development (as opposed to language  manuals) that have stood the test of time.  Steve McConnell has written two  of them this and 'Rapid Development'.<br />Code Complete contains an absolute  wealth of information and guidance on how to develop commercial quality  maintainable software.  Everything is covered from designing to naming  conventions to reviewing to testing to deploying.  The impressive thing is  that there is very little advocation of particular techniques (it's more  important to have one than what it is).<br />I've made a two page tick list of  checks that I regularly print off and hand out to people before code  reviews and it's surprising how often the reviews are postponed so that  people bring their stuff up to scratch.  None of the items on the list are  particularly specific (e.g.  Are loop index names meaningful (except for  small loops)? or Do all method and functions include comments explaing  their purpose?).<br />Unfortunately, there are very many programmers out there  who can write code for small tasks (e.g. exam questions) but who struggle  when it comes to a commercial project and the situation hasn't improved  over the years.  It's not because they're stupid but because they're not  being given a proper grounding in the fundamentals.  Lots of companies send  their programmers on courses to get them up to speed on particular  languages but few spend any time making sure the programming basics are up  to scratch.  Given that the situation isn't likely to change very fast,  this book goes a long way to redressing the balance.  <br />It should be on  every programmer's bookshelf (regardless of the programmin language they  use) along with Rapid Development, Design Patterns and Refactoring.
B000002AGN|5.0|I'm 15 years old and I recently received this CD as a gift from my father.  My parents listened to this album way back in the early 60's when it just came out, and they even loved it back then.  I have been studying music and  playing the piano for the past 8 years and this collection of songs is a  staple in my repetoire.  Even though I've never quite been a jazz  &quot;cool cat&quot; I think that after hearing this album, I am now  addicted to this kind of music! I HIGHLY reccomend Time Out!

6304119046|4.0|I went through my Citizen Kane phase a few years ago.  It's over now, so I can, thankfully, read the negative reviews below without feeling threatened. This film worked magic for me at one time, and still could  again if I were in the right mood.  The key, to me, is the sound and the  music.  Bernard Herrmann's score evokes feelings that are unique, that no  other movie score that I've heard comes close to.  This has little to do  with its intrinsic qualities as music.  It has everything to do with the  context in which the music is heard:  what's on the screen, what else is  being heard, where we've been in the story and where we're going. I'll give  one example.  After the long, soul-grinding Leland segment we cut to the  outside of Susan Alexander's nightclub.  The weather is calm (unlike the  first visit to the nightclub which took place during a thunderstorm) but  there is a chastened, morning-after-a-storm feeling.  In order to feel  this, we need to have already experienced: a) Susan Alexander's anger  during the first visit  b) the thunderstorms during the first visit c) the  later thunderstorm during the Bernstein segment d) the emotional  meat-grinder of the Leland segment. Both the characters and us have been  softened up by what's come before, but it is the music at this moment, a  quiet back-and-forth figure in the winds, that draws all these threads  together to express something for which the best phrase I can come up with  is &quot;a feeling of being chastened by life.&quot;
158234082X|4.0|Part autobiography, part a &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; view of professional kitchens, and part soap opera, I have a much greater appreciation of what a professional chef and/or cook goes through. It's not always pretty, and  sometimes very rough, but the book shows that many of the people who cook  professionally really love it.<br />While it is not a cookbook (there are no  recipes) it does talk a little about some little tricks of the trade, like  the use of butter and stock. I learned that if a kitchen in is a hurry, and  a customer orders a well done steak, they may throw it in a deep fat fryer,  to both save time, and to demonstrate their lack of respect of a customer  who likes to &quot;destroy&quot; a good piece of meat (fortunately, I am a  medium-rare steak eater). The section dealing with the authors opinions of  vegetatians is both illuminating and very funny.<br />All in all, a  fascinating read, that is generally well written. And after reading this  book, I have learned to NEVER order fish on Monday.
630575067X|4.0|This movie is worth checking out! The special effects are incredible...don't be fooled by what others tell you. It may not be a great Star Wars flick...but you should see it anyways. The first 3 films in the  past were great, but Episode 1 is much better because the way the scenes  were filmed, but the story line was weird. George Lucus once again shows  how the galaxy was meant to be seen with today's high special effect  wizards!
B000009O8A|1.0|This is one bad film. It has all the style and charm of a 1970 porno flick but with none of the benefits. Okay there me sex and violence, but is that enough? As that isn't even done well I saw no. All in all this is one Nasty  Video.
B000000OEI|5.0|Even if you haven't seen this film this album is worth buying.  From the first track you are lulled into a peaceful place inside yourself.  Suddenly the composer slips a gear, guns the engine and BANG! your heart races and  the adrenaline kicks in.  It takes a lot to get a film and music to match  perfectly and this is a perfect match, like coffee and cream.  All the  tension and excitement from the motion picture is here and you will be on  the edge of your seat, just with the CD!  If you don't own it yet BUY IT!,  if you haven't watched it yet SEE IT!  Perfect together and perfect apart.  A breathtaking CD.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I enjoyed this CD. It has the great #1 hit &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; and the sexy &quot;Waiting for Tonight.&quot; These are the stand-outs. The rest of the CD is okay. &quot;Feeling So Good&quot; sounds more like  something you would hear in a club. The duet with Mark Anthony is pretty.  Anyways,the two radio hits &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; and &quot;Waiting  For Tonight&quot; are the main reason to buy this one.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is the album that established Joe Satriani as one of the modern-day guitar gods, and deservedly so! This is a masterpiece of writing and skill. &quot;Surfing With the Alien&quot; starts it off and establishes Joe's  early tone that was copied by so many. This one also starts a series of  songs related to the Marvel superhero Silver Surfer (this album cover;  &quot;Back to Shalla-Bal&quot; on the album &quot;Flying in a Blue  Dream&quot; and &quot;The Power Cosmic 2000, parts 1&amp;2 on &quot;Engines  of Creation&quot;) &quot;Satch Boogie&quot; is an extremely rockin' tune  that is his trademark. Still jaw-dropping after all this time. &quot;Always  With You, Always With Me&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs ever  written and is one of the songs that got him noticed by mainstream  audiences (it is often played during figure skating routines, along with  another song by Joe, &quot;All Alone&quot;) &quot;Circles&quot; is a song  that was probably a source of inspiration for many alternative and punk  bands simply for the fact that it starts out nice and soft, then goes  nuclear, then back to nice and soft. Plus, &quot;Crushing Day&quot; is one  of the most all-around perfect songs I've ever heard. As a whole, this is a  must-definitely-own for any fan of the guitar. Well deserving of the  perfect score.
1577311523|5.0|Echkart Tolle's book is a living and powerful vehicle that takes the reader gently by the hand into the Now if they but will allow it.  <br />Via a question and answer format, he addresses just about every issue, question,  and objection that anyone could possible raise on the subject.  <br />The  power that the Now carries is transmitted in his words and seems to  &quot;ring true&quot; in the heart of the reader.<br />I highly recommend this  book for anyone who has read about being in the Now and desired it but  somehow has not been able to come close to experiencing it.  He writes in  his introduction that he hopes that his book will act as a catalyst for a  &quot;radical inner transformation&quot; in those who are ready for it.   Well, there is no question in my mind that it indeed can cause such a  transformation.<br />One of the things he said that had a great impact on me  was, &quot;The moment you realize you are not present, you are  present.&quot;  So simple.  <br />This is a book you will want to keep in  reach to renew and refresh yourself with anytime you need it.
6304057709|3.0|I loved this movie. Not for its base on the classic novel, but for the personality the actors brung to their roles.These actors made me truly believe I was there.<br />I also enjoyed the authenticy of the costumes and  language.<br />Even if you have never read the novel SENSE AND SENSIBILITY you  will enjoy and fall in love with this film.
6305558167|4.0|&quot;La Morte de Arthur&quot; put to film, Excalibur is  dark, beautiful, silly and sad at different times.  With wonderful actors (Patrick Stewart! ) and amazing writing, the film portrays an accurate portrayel  (for Hollywood at least) of the French Arthurian legends.  It keeps both  the good of things Arthur and Merlin's friendship, as well as the  disturbing stuff like the child Arthur has with his sister Morganna.  Well  done.
B00000JGOH|2.0|I know I am probably the only person in the world to not fall in love with this movie, but I do not love this movie.   <br />The story line and plot is amazing. How a woman can want to become an actor. Yet in my personal  opinion they could have picked better actors. Yes I am a Gwenyth Paltrow  fan, yet her acting seemed at times tiresome. Joseph fines could have added  more to his character.<br />The only part of this movie that was the most  enjoyable for me was the end.
B00000J7LA|5.0|I was very pleased to get this CD, specifically to have &quot;Music for Tables&quot;. The other 3 bonus tracks help make this well worth the money. &quot;Always In The Past&quot; sounds like the lyrics were laid down a week  before Roland decided to split from the old group and write some new  music...he sounded uninspired. There are some nice remastering nuances  noticeable, like on &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot;. The  highlight of this Seeds of Love work remain Phil Collin's melodic  percussion on &quot;Woman In Chains&quot; and Oleta Adams on all her  tracks. I wish Oleta, Curt and Roland were all in a studio making music;  this CD represents some of their finest work.
B000007OY0|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever had the priviledge of viewing. This movie had all the components to make an excellent classic.<br />The actors-Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, were GREAT.  Robbins and Freeman prove great allies and friends in this movie. Unlike  other films I truly believed these two had a genuine friendship. <br />The  plot was amazing. Focusing on the story of a man wrongly imprisoned for the  murder of his wife. The story continues as the man continues through his  years in prison and eventually his unconventional way of getting out.<br />I  recommend that everyone who loves great films should see this movie. It  will renew your faith in the human spirit.
0525457585|5.0|Michael Ende's &quot;Neverending Story&quot; is a childhoodclassic in Germany and is truly a great novel. After reading the HarryPotter novels and JK Rowling's imaginative world full of great ideas, I had to think of the worlds Ende creates in his novels, of his ability to bring together pieces of different mythologies and fairy tales and to create a witty book full of references, word play and ideas. This book should not have been made into a movie for it is an argument in favour of the world of reading and &quot;the movies&quot; that are created in your mind.  It is very sad that Ende died some years ago and therefore will not be able to bring us more novels like this and I am very surprised that most of his other books are still not available in English.
158234082X|5.0|Short review...buy it, read it, you'll like it. The writing style is engaging and interesting, the life experiences and lessons learned are entertaining and very funny. This is a great pool-side book, great for a  relaxing and enjoyable read. I particularly liked the part early in the  book, where he describes his idolizing the experienced chef and assistants  in the kitchen of a Provincetown seafood joint. <br />This book is well  written and I recommend it highly.
B00004CWO8|5.0|This is a filmed version of a widely-acclaimed production of Swan Lake done by London dance company Adventures in Motion Pictures, as staged in both London and New York. It was filmed at a live performance, but other than moments at the curtain calls, and during one specific scene in the ballet, where the live audience can be seen (appropriately in all cases), it could easily have been filmed in a studio. The camerawork and editing are the best I've ever seen of a live performance, coming as close as I can imagine is possible to conveying the sense of being present at the performance. The soundtrack, a slightly edited version of the full ballet score, is full-blooded, well played, and of studio quality. (It is identical to the sound on the separate audio CD release of this version of the ballet.) The packaging contains extensive liner notes, including an interview with Matthew Bourne explaining how he came to this re-visioning of a classic ballet. High marks for technical quality of this DVD.<br />It is fair to warn people of the content of the performance: this is *not* the traditional ballet most people would be familiar with, and does not contain the original Petipa choreography. Instead, it is a wholly new ballet, retaining the Tchaikovsky score. Bourne has abandoned the traditional \\"beautiful maidens trapped in a spell by an evil magician desperate to be saved by the handsome prince\\" scenario. Instead, we have an exceptionally moving depiction of a young man, a prince -- in an unidentified land, though its monarchy, class structure and mores suggest a 1930s Britain, albeit one with jazz-den waterfront dives -- who is forced to live a life for which he is ill-suited and who finds himself increasingly unhappy, until the spirit of the life he could or should have had, the one that was denied him by the fate of his birth, bursts into his consciousness in the form of a vibrantly-male swan, smashing his equilibrium. A note here: just ignore the alarmists who gasp atthe fact that all the swans are male; there is a reason for them being so, and this is not a gay love story. It is a powerful depiction of a man trying to come to terms with his own true self, and it contains wit and beauty, some remarkable dancing and often breathtaking imagery. It owes a great debt to Jung and is better suited to a modern world far more oriented to psychotherapy and internal vision than to the romantics of Tchaikovsky's time.<br />I found the ballet intensely moving and quite beautiful, and I rate this DVD highly.
0425104052|5.0|This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels.  It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable.  I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these  few pages.  I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!
B000003NA4|4.0|What an enjoyable, low-key jazz disc.  Ms. Krall has a wonderfully silky voice that is never overpowered by her trio.  It's about a 50-50 split between mid-tempo numbers (All or Nothing at All, Peel me a Grape), and  tranquil ballads (I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You,  Garden in  the Rain); a lot of the songs are familiar classics.  This is the kind of  disc to listen to on a rainy day.  Think of her as a female Harry Connick,  Jr in his 'When Harry Met Sally' days, or as a modern day Ella Fitzgerald  without all the horns.
B000002UB3|5.0|I think the fact that Abbey Road, an album which is now over thirty years old, is, as of today (July 17, 2000), in the top 25 bestsellers at Amazon says quite enough about this extraordinary album. It's currently selling  better than Eminem's latest. It seems that some people do actually know  what great music is after all.
B00000K19E|5.0|There isn't much to say about the Matrix that hasn't been said already. The Follow the White Rabbit feature is the most endearing part of the film....personally I can't wait for the two sequals to be made and  released.
B00003Q43A|4.0|&quot;Independence Day&quot; may not be the best science-fiction in film history, but it definitely isn't the worst.  The appearance of the alien ships and the firestorm that destroys some of the major U.S. cities are the  highlights of this film -the destruction of the White House is  staggering.<br />However director Roland Emmerich presents us a true recycled  product of some of the old science-fiction films.  There are shots in this  movie that are almost the same -and sometimes a carbon copy -as &quot;Star  Wars&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Battlestar  Galactica&quot;, &quot;Star Trek-The Motion Picture&quot;,  &quot;Firefox&quot;, and countless others.  Who knows if he was paying a  tribute to those movies?<br />This special edition DVD presents this movie  with 9 minutes of additional footage.  One interesting thing about this  extra material is that I could finally find the relationship of drunken  pilot Russell Casse with his &quot;son&quot; Miguel.  Apart from that,  there is nothing interesting in the extra scenes.<br />All in all, this DVD  presentation is a real kick.  It's worth the price.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I quite enjoyed Dogma, and it was one of Kevin Smith's top efforts so far. The 'controversy' that it caused was mostly unfounded other than via plain ignorance by those protesting. It's purpose is to get you to take a wider  look at religion by finding ways to poke fun at it..and at the same time  enhance the understanding of what it all is suppossed to mean. All the  characters were decently fleshed, and well cast..
6305313687|2.0|A very corny film that doesn't develop any of the portrayed characters except Norton's role. Cheesy slo-mo sequences like Bevery D'Angelo's scene where she kneels down in front of her house looked so amateurish.   And the  sports metaphor of the film!  White skinheads beating black homeboys  at...get this.... basketball?    And the &quot;super intellectual&quot;  high school teacher, reportedly possessing two PhD degrees, using a  double-negative in one grammatically disappointing scene. This film  could've said and done so much more than it did.  The murder scene on the  street curb was totally unnecessary -  leaving it out would not have  detracted from the film's &quot;message&quot;.....so why?   Second rate  entertainment at best.
B00002Z88D|5.0|The version of One on this 2 CD set made the wait for it worthwhile. I throughly enjoy listening to it, and the orchestra backing up Metallica is a quality sound, that could spark a new direction in the Rock/Metal genre.
B000002JEV|5.0|One of my favorite collections.  So powerful, I'll be doing my work for school and be listening to the second CD on my headphones and actually stop and just listen to this, it grabs your attention like little else does.   The first disc is a lot of early stuff like &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and  &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; but songs like &quot;Travellin  Riverside Blues&quot; is a lost classic.  Disc two-through and through is  mature Zep, great stuff.
0780624890|5.0|The special features and vignettes made Blade on DVD even more enjoyable than the VHS Version, not that anything should take away from that. The movie itself is fun, and this has probably been the best rendition of a  comic book character on film outside of Tim Burton's original Batman film  with Michael Keaton.
B000008DA5|5.0|This album contains all that the reasons why the you've heard that the Beach Boys were such an influence on rock n' roll.   Paul McCartney said that he was always &quot;trying to keep up with the Beach Boys music&quot;.  I always thought the Beatles to be the more innovative of the two  groups...until I heard this album.  In fact, I've heard many famous rock  stars say that the Beach Boys' music was a big influence...from Paul  McCartney to Andy Partridge (of XTC) to Frank Black (of the Pixies).  And  once again, I couldn't see what the big deal was until I heard this album.  A truely original and happy album.  If the fabeled &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;  was the result of the beginning of Brain Wilsons drug use and mental  illness, then the album after that:(Smiley Smile/Wild Honey) is, as you'll  hear, obviously recorded when those two things are in full-swing. I was  totally blown away! I give it 5 big stars.
6305750750|3.0|It took too long to get to good sequences, the good sequences didn't last very long, the storytelling took forever, the humor was too spotty, and the best part of the movie..the much anticipated fight scene took less than  even the classic Vader v. Kenobi matchup in Episode IV
0316286869|4.0|as a profressional, I do think this is a great book for creative ideas.  Not right if you want basic info on colors for skintones, though.  Beautiful pictures.
B000040OBS|5.0|Whereas Kraftwerk navigated the [[ASIN:B000007U6V Autobahn]] at a fairly moderate pace, Alan Vega & Martin Rev often break all speed limits. Controlled, even disembodied vocals characterize the German band's music while Suicide's is pierced by whoops, hollers & gasps. Most of these songs are so beautiful and tuneful that they would have been chart material had they been toned down to the level of say, [[ASIN:B000N4S90G OMD]] or Eurythmics. With the exception of the 10 harrowing minutes of Frankie Teardrop, a real piece of \\"psychobilly,\\" the melodies & hooks are irresistible.<br /><br />The pulsating Ghost Rider with its ominous drone is quite anthemic, more minimalist than Alan Vega's later [[ASIN:B000002MAP solo version]]. Although still appealing, Rocket USA is eerie & doom-laden while Cheree is a mid-tempo ballad with an enchanting chiming melody unfolding behind the drone. There are lighter, more accessible and highly catchy tracks like Johnny and Girl, another slow number with a hypnotic arrangement & richly textured sounds. The remix of Cheree sounds more soulful & romantic than the original. Its chugging rhythms & yearning vocals give I Remember a melancholic air. Then follows Keep Your Dreams, an addictive ditty with a lilting flow.<br /><br />Disc 2 consists of 6 live performances recorded at CBGB's. Mr Ray is a heavy but surprisingly subdued interpretation of the Velvets' [[ASIN:B000002G7E Sister Ray]], Las Vegas Man a musically monotonal but vocally exuberant excursion, and the cover of the 60s pop hit 96 Tears is punctured by crashing sound effects & Vega's yelping. There's a slower and warmer rendition of Keep Your Dreams where the synth sounds like an organ, and a menacing rather than mournful I Remember with some blood-curdling screams and echoing vocals. Sparks fly on the spectacular Harlem with its driving beat where Vega growls & bellows instead of the usual gasping & yelling.<br /><br />The brutal Brussels performance is cacophonic, dissonant and marred by feedback. Tension builds up through the swearing, booing, chanting and scattered clapping, culminating in the dispute over the microphone. It was quite a riot according to the sleeve-notes, making [[ASIN:B0012X6FT4 Elvis Costello]] for whom they opened, even more caustic than he was in those days.<br /><br />The band's sound on this album ranges from a unique type of electronic rockabilly to experimental like one of their Mute label-mate bands, [[ASIN:B000003Z6U The Normal]] (Warm Leatherette & TVOD), to the accessible territory later explored by The Human League, Eurythmics & OMD. The main difference with Kraftwerk is that in unifying man & machine, the German band restrained the emotions while Suicide does just the opposite by using the electronics to amplify emotions to the extreme. On the later CD [[ASIN:B0006IUE70 A Way of Life]], they did take a more pop approach but sacrificed most of the passion. This seminal album remains a masterpiece of electronic pop-rock.ension builds up through the swearing, booing, chanting and scattered clapping, culminating in the dispute over the microphone.

0767903854|2.0|Bryson's book is an account of his trip to Australia, an account which has been embellished by exageration, extrapolation, inventions and parodies. An example is an event which Bryson suggests was an A-bomb detonation, but was  in fact the impact of a piece of man-made space junk. The reentry of this  junk was monitored before impact; and the impact site was surveyed and  photographed; and so the event is not the mystery Bryson claims. A second  example is Bryson's parodying of poetry by one of Australia's revered bush  and war poets: Andrew Barton Paterson, CBE, but Bryson omitted any  inclusion of Paterson or his work in the book's list of references. This  book is funny in places, but the inaccuracies and the infantile quality of  the writing (and repeated focus on excretia jokes)will ensure that it will  be soon forgotten.
B00003CX59|3.0|Sleepy Hollow is truely a visual masterpiece! But other than that, it's not all that great. However, I must give credit where credit is due. The acting is good, and so is the dialogue. It also has some very good comical  moments. Sadly though, this tale of an officer inspecting mysterious  murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow by a ghostly, head-less  horseman---just doesn't click. Although Johnny Depp's character is  developed well, along with Christina Ricci's, the movie seems to not know  what it wants to be: a gruesome, slash-em-up film, or a subtle,  comedy-thriller. Also, the effects aren't so great; they appear OK because  of the unique atmosphere and beautiful settings, but in all reality they're  not realistic at all. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, because it's  not...I'm just saying, don't expect too much of it.

6305265488|5.0|Possibly one of the best Cinderella adaptions, this gem offers a twist on the classic story: what if there were no &quot;Fairy Godmother&quot;? Well, the result is a fantastic movie with great acting and a delightful  storyline. Drew Barrymore is *perfectly* cast as Cinderella, along with  Anjelica Huston as her cruel step-mother. Wonderful movie!  I thuroughly  enjoyed every minute of it.
6305177473|4.0|In this re-make of the Halley Mills classic, I was surprised to find that everything was ship-shape: the acting was superb, the directing was great, the dialogue (though lacking in some areas) was Ok, and over-all it was  great fun! The movie centers around two young teen-age girls who meet at  summer camp and discover that they are actually twins, sperated at birth!  The girls eagerly switch places, in hopes of getting their divorced parents  back together. Of course, there are complications...great movie that makes  the unbelievable plot, well, believeable, with the great acting and script.  Way worth watching!
B00000JPH5|4.0|In this delightful movie from director Jim Henson, a teen-age girl's baby sibling is kidnapped by the Goblin King. Attempting to get her young sibling back, the girl (played wonderfully well by Jennifer Connelly)goes  through a twisting, confusing, frightning labyrinth. Though this movie is  fun and exciting, at times it can seem dull---but keep watching and you  most likely will enjoy this great flick.
B00004SCX6|5.0|She has really cool music. Almost everyone I know likes it. All the songs are cool. I've been dying to have my own CD because she's got such good music and I love it. But my brothers don't like it as much, so they won't  let me listen to it when they're in my room.
0440211727|5.0|This is my first and will not be my last John Grisham book.  I was captivated from the very beginning, and never wanted to lay the book down.  I was captivated by all the pre-trial activites leading up to the big trail  day.  Once the trail started, I refused to lay the book down until I was  finished.  I was pulling for Carl and Jake the entire book, and glad to see  that they stuck to their principles and faith in each other and did not let  the other character's greed desire for personnel glory stand in their way.   A truely great book.
B000001FO4|5.0|great mix of slow songs and hard rock. Very good all around album
B00000295A|5.0|This has to be the best Jamiroquai album of the four. If you are a fan of thier new electronica tunes, this is not for you. On this album it contain some very funky tunes including: &quot;Emergency on Planet  Earth,&quot;&quot;Hooked Up,&quot;and&quot;Music of the Mind.&quot;
6304509154|5.0|Poltergiest is a special effects-laden shocker that plays off of one of our worst fears: the unknown. It's a chilling movie with top-notch acting, and is by far a visual masterpiece! Directed by Tobbe Hooper (The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre) and produced by Steven Spielberg (E.T.), this movie will  keep you biting your nails until the credits are finished rolling.    The  story opens up in the suburbs, somewhere in California. In this seemingly  ideal living area, we meet the Freeling family.  The Freelings are your  typical American family. They're all very normal. But their house isn't.  Strange things occur around the house, such as chairs moving by themselves  and things becoming mis-placed; and the little girl, Carol Anne, starts  talking to the TV when it is turned onto an empty channel... Then it  happens: five year-old Carol Anne is kidnapped by something not of this  earth...something so powerful, it can only be called The Beast.     After  Carol Anne's kidnapping by the evil spirits, her voice can be heard calling  out from every corner of the house, but she cannot be found! Seeking help,  the Freelings turn to a group of psychics; but the demented forces that  have young Carol Anne in their grip won't let her go without a  fight....Imaginative, frightening, funny, witty, spellbinding...Poltergeist  is all of these. It's a one-of-a-kind flick that garnered two blockbuster  sequals, and an important place in movie history.
B000002KIE|5.0|that should speak for itself. i'm not gonna waste your time with another opinion on their background. whether you believe they were punk rock revolutionaries or just a group of puppets doesn't really matter. whatever  they did it caused enough stir that we're still talking about it to this  day.<br />as for the music itself, it's raw screamy energetic catchy rock n  roll, not as clean as the clash but cleaner than the new york dolls. if  that sounds good to you then buy it. i personally think every song on the  album is great, and i play it whenever ive got tons of energy and im  jumping around uncontrollably. also if you like the pistols, The Great Rock  n Roll Swindle (soundtrack) is really the only other album you need, (and  maybe a live album or bootleg to get what's not on those two) it's got more  of the same type of songs with other members of the band singing, as well  as some live versions and really weird stuff like a disco medley of four  pistols songs.
6304675348|4.0|I found Scream to be an enjoyable spoof on the horror genre. In Scream, we meet Sydney, a young girl who is being hunted down by a horror-movie obsessed killer. Keeping the &quot;rules of a horror movie&quot; in mind,  Sydney is determined to keep away from this psycho-killer, but can she?  With clever dialogue and thrilling sequences, Scream is a winner, MUCH  better than Wes Craven's next movie, Wishmaster...ugh, don't let me get  started on that one! So my advice to you is to get this funny, scary, and  highly likeable flick from the creator of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm  Street.&quot;
0440219078|4.0|I thought that the book &quot;the Giver&quot; was well written and although the store line was very loose.  Lois Lowery wrote some good dialog between characters, but I thought that the word choice could have been better.  The storie was unorignal and it conterdicts it self alot.  I had  to read the book for summer school so we watched movies from the 70's that  were almost the exact same thing as the Giver only 20 years earlier.
B000002MU3|5.0|Not since their best album ever, Life's Rich Pagent, have REM issued an album as a whole which matches the gems from their early career.  This is one of those  &quot;if-you-could-only-take-with-you-to-a-deserted-island&quot; albums.   Sonically speaking, this is a very tight record.  The tones Peter Buck uses  are amazing and the back-up vocals continue to please.  Oh, yea.  Stipe....  fine as always....
051788710X|5.0|Hit home! I shared alot of the same experiences that I was reading about and still do. It opened new doorways to spirit and it was beneficial in  helping me use my dreams as a tool for my daily interactions. I have  recommended it to everyone and I plan to incorporate some of the lessons I  have learned into a discussion group I attend. Sorry I can't make it to  Australia in November-Sounds Great!
B00000163G|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out, and I'm still listening to it now.  Both disks are very good all the way through and there is some varience in style from song to song.  This is the cd by witch all other rap  cd's should be rated.  There really aren't any lows on this cd.  I would  suggst this cd to anyone.  Even if you don't like rap you should give this  cd a listen beacause Tupac has something to say unlike alot of new rappers  that just talk about all of the cars that they have bought.  If you don't  already own this one go get it now. You won't be disappointed!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden is back and the most definatly prove that with this album. Good metal, that really grabs you inside the music, if you know what I mean. Maiden fans, you'll love this album!
B00000JCOV|4.0|Let me start by saying that I really don't like this type of music.  I generally like rap, but one day I was on Napster and I couldn't think of any song that I really wanted to download. I had heard of this band but  never heard any of their music so I downloaded a couple of songs.  I was  blown away.  Later that day I went to the store and bought the cd.  It  doesn't disappoint at all.  From beginning to end this cd is tight.  I  would suggest that anyone take at least a listen to this band.  Not  everyone will like them, but they've got a sound that is purly their own.
B00004RF98|5.0|The movie is a classic, and the only comment I'm making here is that of the 40 or more DVD's that we own, this one has the best picture quality of all.  And, it is done in the 3:4 normal tv aspect ratio, which we  appreciate (don't care for the letterbox format used in many other DVD  products we've purchased, such as South Pacific).
0140135154|4.0|After reading Berger's book, you should be able to fill in the blanks yourself.<br />Berger, of course, didn't forsee the internet- and the &quot;democritiziationn of bandwidth,&quot; but, if you've read this book,  you'd be well prepared to anticipate the suppression  of &quot;pirate  broadcasting.&quot;<br />This book changed my perception- now whenever I go  into an art museum (or watch PBS or Jerry Springer for that matter)I'm  always looking for who benefits financially.  Of course, the book's about  painting mostly, but you can see the obvious parallels to pretty much any  other form of artistic media- Berger's analysis applies in spades, for  example, to Mappelthorpe's photography (funded not by the NEA, but,  orignally, by wealthy patrons!)<br />&quot;Mobil Masterpiece Theatre?&quot;  Ha! *That's* an oxymoron!
B00004THAY|5.0|After my first listen of this CD, I knew it was soon to become an instant favorite.  The two of them play off of each other beautifully.  I can't imagine what took them so long to collaborate together.  It just seems like  a perfect match.  The title cut is smooth, but my favorite has to be  &quot;Help The Poor.&quot;  This CD has yet to be taken out of my CD  player.  An instant classic in my book!
6305750750|1.0|I want those 2 1/2 hours of my life back, Lucas! The script was right out of an episode of that really bad Dungeons and Dragons cartoon in the mid-80s, the characters were as deep as a hole dug by Mr Burns using a  toothpick and the story was as exciting as watching &quot;Random  Hearts&quot; in slo-mo. Save yourselves 2 1/2 hours and stare at a wall  instead-it will be as productive!
6301963911|3.0|Woody Allen is a classic no matter who you are, or if you like him, you have to admit that. Even though he plays the same characters in all his movies. Watching Annie Hall I thought his views were funny, but his  character is just soooo annoying, in this and all of his movies. Movies  like &quot;Celebrity&quot; where he writes and doesn't act, are a lot  better. God bless you Woody Allen for ya' writing and directing talents,  but God help ya' if you can't act.
B00004RFFM|3.0|Jaws, with its rubber shark, was far more impressive than these weak CGI effects. The vast majority of effects screamed CGI and were thoroughly unconvincing in motion, texture and appearance. The movie could never  decide if the sharks moved at normal speed or faster than thought and their  research into shark behavior must have been more limited than my own.  Sharks don't attack from the head down and it's dubious to the point of  ludicrous to assume that one generation of genetic tampering would change  millions of years of successful predation in that way. The story line had  interesting concepts but fell short of fulfilling its potential. Character  development was weak to the point that I didn't care who got eaten with the  exception of the cook. Predictable and disappointing. Comparable to Jaws 3.  Unworthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as the original Jaws,  which was  masterfully told with rich character development.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This newest BG CD is one their best so far... The MP3 of Nightfall got me to buy this CD. And this CD got me to like Metal. Since I bought this CD I have bought ALL of the BG CD's (even those pretty crummy first ones). There  are none like this. Tolkien would have to be proud. These songs follow very  closely the events of the Silmirillion. The guitar of the very first song  (Into the Storm) is EXTREME! NOTHING can prepare you for it, and no one can  come close to the raw power of those solos. The epic choir vocals of  Nightfall are the best I've heard of BG, or anyone else for that matter. I  never gorw tired of this CD, each time I listen to it I hear something new,  and its like always listening to it for the very first time. If you are  just getting into the Power Metal genre its always good to start with the  best, Blind Guardian. This is German power metal at its greatest! I eagerly  await BG's next CD (they seem to get better and better as BG get's  older...). One last word on the guitar: People make a big fuss about how  good Santana, Blind Guardian makes Santana look like a little boy with a  banjo... and BG actually sings! :)
B000000WA4|4.0|This is a much better album than Siamese Dream (then again I still only paid ten bucks for this hee hee!). The first disc has mostly soft sounding songs and has some of the best stuff the Pumpkins have ever done. The  second disc gets more into rock but sounds kinda like Siamese Dream Part 2.  Not that I'm comparing the albums though. The lyrics are better too. By the  way even though the albums have &quot;Dusk to Dawn&quot; and &quot;Dawn to  Dusk&quot;  written on them they really don't have much of a night or day  theme to them. (For a day and night themed album listen to the Moody Blues'  &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;). Buy this album for ten bucks at a used  CD store. Paying full price might not make it seem so great.
B00000J7JH|2.0|It was 2:00 a.m. I heard a horrible sound it was my older brothers radio blaring that horrible horrible music told him to stop that music.  It was Horrible.
B000000WJZ|3.0|OK I know lots of people will hate me for saying this but Billy Corgan is full of it. Granted this album is good. And I'm not trying to bash the Pumpkins. (I have plenty of freinds that are fans that think Corgan is a  bit full of himself) This album has some great songs. For it's time I guess  it was amazing what with all those Nirvana Jam kids runnning around trying  to whine how they don't want to be famous. Buy this album cause it has some  pretty good songs. But don't pay full price. Do what I did and get it for 9  or 10 bucks at a used CD store. That way even if you do love it more than I  did you'll feel better caused you saved some bucks. So in conclusion I say  buy this album for &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and the other five or six songs  this album starts with for some wholesome moshing fun. But don't pay full  price.
0812550706|5.0|&quot;Ender's Game&quot; is the novel that brought me back to science fiction.  After an adolescence spent reading every last word of science fiction and fantasy I could get my hands on, I went off to college, became  an English major, and discovered I had terrible taste.  I stopped reading  the genre for almost a decade, until a friend of mine shoved a copy of  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; into my hands and told me to remember what reading  was all about.  And &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is an all-out page-turning,  idea-laden, exciting read with the best surprise ending of almost any novel  I can think of offhand.  Although Orson Scott Card denies ever having read  Robert Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; the novel is an almost  point-by-point refutation of Heinlein's closely argued paean to the  morality of war.  I adore Heinlein's book, even though I disagree with most  of his arguments; Orson Scott Card's plea for tolerance and rational  discourse before violence strikes my post-Vietnam mindset as far more  valid.  But I go back to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; just to keep my mind  sharp; a part of me thinks Heinlein knew what he's talking about.  In  short, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; are the  bookends to any discussion about the future of the military and our  species' proper stance when the (hopefully) inevitable contact with  extraterrestrials takes place some day. And until then, I will always be  grateful to Card for waking me up from my snobbery and sending me back to  my roots.  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is a novel that needs to be read by  everyone, both for its ideas and its sheer, fierce joy.  I've taught it now  for four years, and few students can keep themselves from finishing it the  first night they start it.
0380804557|5.0|I love anything Neil Gaimen  write. His style of writing just flows so freely that you are done with the book before you know it. The charactors are always suprising and you never know what is lurking around the corner.  This story is reminiscent of Neverwhere which also involves a man  adventures in a magical world.
0812550757|5.0|&quot;Ender's Game,&quot; a fabulous novel, was rewritten from a novella specifically to allow the writing of &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; a  considerably more complicated and challenging novel.  Ender Wiggin has  travelled from world to world, trying to find a new home for the Hive Queen  whose race he eradicated, so that he can expiate his guilt.  Along the way,  he has become a Speaker for the Dead, a kind of professional eulogist who  bares the soul of the corpse with all flaws revealed, so that we can come  to truly know the dead.  On the next world that Ender comes to, he becomes  personally involved in the family of the deceased, and in the indigenous  sentient species of this world, the Pequeninos.  A far more difficult book  to read than &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; a very different narrative style  drives the philosophical discussion of racism, family, love, and genocide.   Readers searching for the same kind of adventure story as &quot;Ender's  Game&quot; should read &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;; anyone looking for a  truly serious, marvelous philosophical novel that also moves with grace  should read &quot;Speaker for the Dead.&quot;
B000000993|5.0|This album is what hard rock is all about. My first sampling of Tool came almost 5-6 years ago, when I first heard Sober. I borrowed a copy of Undertow from a friend for a while, but unfortunately, I listened primarly  to Sober and Prison Sex, not bothering to give the other tracks a chance. I  rediscovered Tool's music a few years ago after hearing Stinkfist and  buying Aenima. I have to say that out of the 3 albums, Undertow blows the  other two away. Opiate is an auspicious debut, but lacks focus, and Aenima  is more of a wandering into darker, murkier themes and tones. Undertow  combines the best elements of both these albums, and strips away the  unwanted bits. Tool's sound is especially helped by Paul D'Amour's  outstanding bass talent (it's a shame he left prior to Aenima; Justin's  playing is good, but not nearly at the same level); his playing is both  rhythmic and melodic, something not many other bassists can do and do well.  Standout songs include the haunting Sober, ultra-agressive and pounding  Crawl Away, and the epic soul-searching Flood. Overall, Maynard's extreme  vocal talent, backed by some of the best musicians in the business, makes  for a landmark musical experience.
630575067X|4.0|Nearly every critic this side of the galaxy has bashed The Phantom Menace, saying that the characters are two dimensional and that Jar-Jar is a pain  to listen to. They say it lacks a good plot, and the dialouge is atrocious.  They say the characters have no real goals, and that the scenes in  Coruscant are boring. One of them even said the special effects are'nt that  good!<br />DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!  THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST THE  GREATEST SCI-FI FRANCHISE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND! <br />I'll admit that  the characters are flat in terms of personality, but I really don't care,  because it's Star Wars. Finally, the viewer gets to see at least some of  the beginning of the saga, with the rest coming in the next few years. I  heard that some people thought that Episode one was to bright and  cheerful... well, it has to be, because the next two are going to be VERY  dark, with the rise of the Empire and all that. Maybe we'll get lucky and  see Jar-Jar die in Episode two! Any way...<br />The special effects in episode  one are spectacular. Everything is just so detailed, from the tiny wires in  Quadrinaro's Pod racer to the way the trade federation deploys its battle  droids... your eyes will will lap it up! But Phantom is'nt just visually  stunning, the audio aspects of the film are very impressive also. Every  single pod racer has its own unique engine sound, like the nascar blast of  Anikin's racer, or the raw powered diesel locomotive of Sebulba's. John  William's score is also of equal level. Many people complained because it  rarely had the original theme in the score, but I think it is better  without it. This is a movie that takes place decades before Episodes four,  five, and six, with no rebel alliance or evil empire. There is no Luke  Skywalker in a Death star, nor is there a certain &quot;piece of junk&quot;  owned by a Han Solo. This is'nt supposed to be like the original Starwars  that much, so a new theme is welcome...especially when it's as good as it  is.<br />But here's the flaws. The dialogue is bad. It's blank, unemotional  blather for the majority of the movie, and Anakin says &quot;Yippie&quot;  to much. The characters are the same; blank, unemotional blather for the  majority of the movie. They have no concrete goals for them to follow.  that's probably why the middle part of the movie is boring to many people  (I find it entertaining, because it explains the government, and the  corruption within).<br />All things considered, I thoroughly enjoyed this  movie. Despite it's numerous flaws (most of them small and opinion based)  Star Wars Epiode 1- The Phantom Menace is one heck of a ride! Just make  sure you bring a blaster pistol along, just in case!
6304143184|5.0|&quot;E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is a classic and one of Steven Spielberg's most famous films. It's probably the one movie that defines the name &quot;Spielberg&quot; more than any other. The logo on the original  movie poster comes from Steven Spielberg's trademark &quot;Amblin  Entertainment&quot; production sign. One of the many things worth  mentioning in this movie is Henry Thomas' performance as Elliot. It is the  best performance from a child actor I have ever seen. He has a lot of  emotional scenes in the movie, which is what makes child actors better.  Whenever I hear or see child actors cry emotionally on-screen in movies, I  call that great acting {same can be said with Haley Joel Osment's  performance as Cole in The Sixth Sense}. I can't wait till a 20th  anniversary edition of this movie comes out to theaters 2 years from now.
B000001DYD|4.0|PJ's second full-length album finds her tapping a harder and darker muse.  Her guitar work on this album ranges from subtle and quiet to loud and abrasive.  As for her vocals, they are sinister and playful, in a very  wicked way.  And that's just in the title track.  In any case, this is  probably PJ's roughest album (produced by Steve Albini), and least  accessible.  I'd reccommend this to fans of Dry.  If you're a fan of her  later albums (namely, Is This Desire? and To Bring You My Love), you might  want to give this one wide berth, as it's definitely more straight-ahead  rock and raw.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This cd is pretty cool. the best song on it is &quot;one kiss from you&quot;. I got kinda sick of &quot;oops&quot; but the rest of the songs are great. Lucky was an annoying song at first but now its okay since its a  music video an all. well hope u buy this cd. its cool! ~L.L.
6305903182|3.0|The extras were there...they were just incredibly hard to find.  I will leave that mystery to you all to make up for the lack of real mystery in this film.
0679746048|5.0|the book is not that organized but it shows reallly well how she felt and she described things very well. it was really differnt from the movie.  but i think the book was better and it made me kept on reading.  it is really a  great book.
0783235968|5.0|This movie blends Iowa, simple living, baseball, family support and faith in a wonderful way, but &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is so much MORE than that.<br />It's about having the ability to step outside of the limiting  confines of mortal views and see the bigger picture, even when everything  that seems real and substantial is telling you that you're a fool!<br />And  when you have the vision and courage to follow your heart's dreams, all the  powers of the Universe conspire to work with you to help you become what  the Voice has told you that you were meant to be!<br />That's what I got out  of the movie.<br />We own this movie and watch it regularly. Have seen it  several times, but it's one of those flicks that regularly illicits a few  tears of joy.<br />Great movie!
6305127638|5.0|By far the best Star Trek movie yet. This includes the directing, the story, the drama, the laughter, frendship, loyalty, survival, freedom, human nature, cold heartedness, eveything! This movie is a way to see all  of humanity. Evil versus good.  The choice is simple. Live as an individual  or live without being able to decide your own destiny. This is what humans  have done throughout their existance. Invadors (Borg) and freedom fighters  (Enterprise crew)  If you remember one thing from the entire movie let it  be the conversation between Data and the Borg Queen. One of the highlights  of that is:  Data &quot;Beliving oneself to be perfect is often a sign of a  delusional mind&quot; and Borg Queen &quot;Small words from a small being  trying to destroy what he doesn't understand&quot;  I'll let you be the  judges of those words. The only thing I didn't quite like was Lily, the  black woman, Chocrane's friend. her character though very inspirational and  with a lot of common sense needed to be developed further.  Overall, i  repeat, the best Star Trek movie ever made!
B00003CXBK|5.0|After years of Hayao Miyazaki's work, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) has been one of his best one.  Actually, all of his work never disappoints the majority of his audiences.  This film is one everyone must see. Of  course, Princess Mononoke story is originaly written and created by Mr.  Hayao Miyazaki.  It took him 13 years of thinking and planning/sketching  and 4 years of working on the film production.  The animation is  astonishing, despite the fact it is traditional classical animation style  viewers are still inspired tremendously.  The music is incredible as well.   Jou Hisaishi has done it again!  He uses traditional instruments from Japan  and China to mix with the symphony instruments.  You can feel as if the  story is coming alive and taking you into its world of the 13th century of  southern Japan. I strongly suggest everyone to see it.  Children under 13  may not understand the theme and story, however, they will grow.  The film  is breathtaking and unforgettable.  You don't have to be Japanese or  Chinese to understand the story plot and culture, the film introduce the  culture to you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album contains three classics on a par with &quot;A day in the Life.&quot;  First, Paranoid Android, with the amazing guitar work that has Brian May wishing he'd taken more lessons.  Not to mention the vocal  harmonies.  Next is &quot;Let Down&quot; with it's thematic examination on  the loneliness of airports.  It successfully merges 5/4 and 4/4 rhythms to  climax with a dual vocal that is truly amazing (and Thom's E is as powerful  as any other singer's high C).  And then there is the lullabye, &quot;No  Surprises.&quot;  It's not easy to write a lullabye about the meaningless  of everyday life.<br />These three standouts (for all of rock) are combined  with a more than stellar cast.  There isn't a weak track on this album.   Even as great as these three are, the heart of the album is arguably the  esoterically personal &quot;Exit Music.&quot;  Mellotron choirs combine  with acoustic guitar to form an unsetlling masterpiece.<br />The greatest  album, ever.
6304466498|4.0|SPACEBALLS was perhaps the last of Mel Brooks' really funny spoof movies. Following from the classic BLAZING SADDLES Western parody, SPACEBALLS takes in all and every science fiction movie, breaking every rule and recycling  every cliche for maximum comic effect.<br />No sci-fi movie is safe: STAR WARS  is the biggest casualty, with plenty of laugh-out-loud references (Pizza  the Hutt and Dark Helmet being just two of many). The plot loses it way to  the insane jokes, much like many of Mel Brooks' movies, but that really  doesn't matter. You'll be laughing too hard to notice.<br />Obviously this  isn't going to appeal to everyone just as science-fiction doesn't appeal to  everyone. However, if you're prepared for a riotous, zany cast (Rick  Moranis as Dark Helmet brings pathetic bad guys to a new level) armed with  a funny script, then SPACEBALLS is for you.
B000002J20|3.0|No, it isn't the worst recording in rock history (no such thing).  No, it isn't the greatest recording in rock history (no such thing).  Yes, track 3 is the &quot;difficult&quot; track (one expects, about halfway through  Steve Howe's acoustic solo, the definitive thudwhack of  &quot;Roundabout&quot; to careen in but no- -it's the difficult track and  twee must reign).  That mine is here the 82nd commentary on this album some  27 years after its initial release on LP (1973) is something in itself.  Many will follow.  If the album is so awful (and it is) then why all the  insidious defense?  If the album is so great (and it is) then why all the  insidious detraction?  Why is this album controversial at all?  Yes, fans  and foes.  Yes.  Bloated and beautiful; majestic and portentious;  pretentious and astounding- -it's Yes.
6303269842|3.0|MAVERICK is based on the old television series of the same name, and follows Mel Gibson's character in an attempt to win a huge poker gambling prize. However, a lawman (played by James Garner) and a feisty femme (Jodie  Foster) end up getting in his way.<br />This is a fun comedy that has its  tongue firmly in cheek. I didn't know of the series, so can't say how  authentic it is. However, I did think that quite a few of the jokes were  either stale or fell flat.<br />The plot's interesting enough - particularly  the twists and turns and plotting that goes on. However, this isn't  sufficient to keep interest going and despite the high energy pacing of  MAVERICK, it ultimately failed to keep my amused.
B00004U9MS|5.0|And forget Radiohead comparisons too.

This is pretty  brutal stuff, that sounds pretty nice.  Comparisons, if you want that sort  of thing: The Drugs Don't Work, by the Verve, mid-period Beach Boys,  somewhat of a combination of the first and second Oasis albums.<br />Get it  before your friends and I guarantee they'll say &quot;WHO'S THAT?&quot;   Reccomended cuts: Shiver, Yellow, ALL!

B00000K3D4|5.0|Jim Henson was quoted as saying, in the DVD special feature Inside the Labyrinth A Documentary, &quot;when I go to a movie I want to feel better coming out than I did going in&quot;. This is exactly the case with this  fun puppet adventure.<br />Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie make a great  pair, battling each other for baby Toby. David Bowie is Jareth the goblin  king. Jennifer Connelly is Sarah, Toby's sister. After getting stuck  babysitting a crying child, Sarah wishes that the goblin king would come  and take Toby far away. When her wish comes true Sarah is forced to go  through the labyrinth to the goblin city, and get back her baby brother  back.<br />Of coarse, it's sounds easier than it turns out to be. Sarah finds  many pitfalls along the way, and some interesting friends as well. The  puppeteering is incredible, engineering the plot to a higher level, and  also spurring many humorous moments. This film is a perfect example of Jim  Henson's creative expertise, and a wonderful film that will leave you with  a grin on your face.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Yes, much of Furtwangler's Brahms is amazing, as is Walter's, and Klemperer's First and Second. But this Solti Brahms set has been unfairly maligned ever since it was released. Like this wonderful cycle, itself, the  Solti/Chicago recordings of the Brahms symphonies deserve more credit than  they get. All things considered, this is one of the best Brahms cycles  going, especially as a budget-priced offering. Those looking to purchase an  inexpensive Brahms Symphony cycle without having to buy individual discs  cannot go wrong with this set. The performances are solid and not lacking  in excitement, especially in thrilling moments like the final codas of the  First, Second, and Fourth. <br />The recordings have been maligned for being  too &quot;boomy,&quot; but I disagree. I think that the full, weighty,  well-rounded, bass response of these recordings is just right for Brahms,  whose orchestral sound starts from the bottom, up. The fullness of these  recordings gives weight and fullness to the brass, timpani, and low  strings,  but the &quot;late analog&quot; sound still has enough clarity to  give plenty of crispness in climactic moments. I think that people who  think these recordings are too &quot;bass heavy,&quot; have become to used  to hearing ineffectively thin recordings of Brahms symphonies: for example,  while I enjoy many of Karajan's recorded performances (and his 1978 Brahms'  Second might be my favorite recording of that symphony) I will concede that  most of his Brahms' recordings sound too thin to give full weight to  Brahms' orchestral sound. Brahms' wonderful symphonies are warm,  passionate, full-blooded works, and they need well-rounded recordings to  fully reveal their beauty. Furtwangler knew that Brahms' sound needed to  have a firm foundation of bass, and while Solti's phrasing may not be as  flexible as Furtwangler's, the orchestral sound on these recordings seems  to have exactly the right depth and fullness for Brahms.<br />I found the  depth of these recordings to be a pleasant surprise in an era when the  Chicago SO's sound was known for being on the &quot;blary&quot; side. I  don't always like Solti's recordings, but I don't think these performaces  can be faulted, unless one doesn't like his observance of the exposition  repeats in these symphonies. Furtwangler's Brahms is undoubtedly great but  I think that most people - who haven't been listening to Brahms for 20  years - may not respond very positively to the &quot;vintage&quot; of his  recordings, or his somewhat histrionic style.
6305165912|4.0|The Big Lebowski is a wonderful, underrated comedy with great acting and an interesting plot. The unusual characters bring on a love hate relationship. If you love them this comedy might become one of your  favorites. If not, give it a chance, you might change you mind on your  second viewing.<br />Jeff Bridges plays \\"the dude\\" who is an unemployed, laid  back hippie. John Goodman is Walter Sobchak, an over reacting, Vietnam  veteran who thinks that every situation has at least a literal connection  to the Vietnam war. Finally Steve Buscemi plays Donnie, who is pretty  clueless individual, always cutting in on the middle of a conversation.  \\"Out of his element\\" Walter says to Donnie. These three opposites make up a  league bowling team. Nearly half the film revolves around bowling. The plot  begins when Jeffrey Lebowski (the dude) has his house broken into, his head  repeatedly forced into a toilet bowl, and his rug peed on, an item which  \\"ties the room together\\". It turns out that the assailants goofed,  originally  planning to harass the other Jeffrey Lebowski, the older richer  Jeffery Lebowski, who's \\"trophy\\" wife, Bunny, owes money around town, even  to known pornographers. These \\"rug pee-ers\\" came to collect, but showed up  at the house of the wrong Jeffery Lebowski. This sounds bizarre, but don't  worry the film gets even more bizarre as it goes on.   <br />Jeff Brides, John  Goodman, and Steve Buscemi are all fantastic at these unusual rolls,  enhancing the humor of the nihilistic plot. However, some audiences might  find this film perverse and unappealing. Give it a chance though. This is  one of those films you might dislike at first, but it may grow on you after  your second viewing.
6305165912|5.0|Jeff Bridges does an absolute fantastic job of acting.  This is the type of movie you have to see the second time before it starts sinking in.  The first time I watched it, I didn't particularily care for it, then I watched  it again and thought it was the best ever!   I guess a person has to be in  the mood for certain films.  One of my all-time favorite movies.  A must  have for any collector of off the beaten path comedies.

Rather mundane compared to other parts of his.<br />That aside, I was not impressed with something Donnie Brasco.  Nothing of this film was bad but nothing stood out. Constantly I was  reminded of other movies that are better then this one. <br />To add to my  frustration, there are no extras on the DVD. Picture and sound quality are  passable. Rental.
6304696515|3.0|This is one of the best movies of all time.   However, the video transfer to DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen.  There are numerous video artifacts that pop up throughout the film.  I find them very distracting  and it makes the movie  difficult for me to watch.  If you choose to buy  this movie as I did, beware.  If you are irritated by video blemishes steer  clear of this title.
B00004SCX6|1.0|After listening to this CD which supposedly displays a more &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;grown up&quot; Britney, I have concluded that this CD is neither mature nor grown up.  How can a 19 year old girl who  sings pop music be considered mature?  Maturity is displayed through an  artist creating their own music which she does not do (according to her  last track, we should thank god that she doesn't write her own music).   This girl has an annoying voice that has no range or power to it.  It is  pitiful the way that she can't even sing during her concerts.  Then  recently she tried to escape the insults by attempting to sing live on the  &quot;Today&quot; show which was a sad performance.  Her voice was cracking  and flat which shows her lack of talent.  She is able to dance though; she  should be the background dancer to someone like Mariah Carey.  All Britney  does is teach all the 10-12 year olds who listen to her that dressing in  practically no clothes will guarantee happiness.  This CD is filled with  songs that get old too fast and have no structure, rhyme or reason.  Never  buy this CD; I can only hope Britney Spears will fade into the background  soon.

B000031WD9|1.0|I went with a group of friends to see this nuch hyped screenplay, and I can tell you that it was not worth it. I came out disappointed and puzzled that so many people (other college students included) thought this was a  great piece.<br />The &quot;I have to lose my virginity&quot; line is taken  to absurd levels that even made a liberal person such as myself shake her  head in disgust.<br />Not even the inclusion of Alyson Hannigan (BTVS) could  have convinced me this movie was as good as everybody said it was.I really  think the script writters and the directors could have and should have done  better. The infamous kitchen scene (from which the title comes from) was  something that might have impressed junior high students, but I did not  think it was good
B000002GC2|5.0|This is one of Quincy Jones' best albums.  Everything about the album is tight, from the instrumentals to the vocals, which are outstanding.  This album was a wonderful  introduction and  showcase for James Ingram with the  classic tunes &quot;100 Ways&quot; and &quot;Just Once.&quot; And PATTI  AUSTIN; what more can you say.  This is her introduction as the &quot;First  Lady&quot; of Qwest records, Quincy's label, after she left CTI.  Her  performance on this album gets you ready for what's to come from her solo  efforts of the decade.  The styles she explores range from the bouncy  &quot;Razzmatazz,&quot; to the understated elation of &quot;Something  Special,&quot; to the knowing lover of &quot;Betcha Wouldn't Hurt Me.&quot;   Patti gets funky on the title track with a little help from others such as  Michael Jackson.  This album was a blueprint for R&amp;B music as the genre  went from the disco era into the new decade.  This is the CLASS ALBUM of  the decade, and one of the albums I would want to have if I was on a desert  island.  A masterpiece.
6304411448|5.0|Although I do not know anybody specifically like the people in this movie, I was impressed with how humanely the mentally-challenged were treated. The idea that they can (let alone have a right to)find romance is still problematic  in many sectors of society.<br /><br />Both Joon (Mary Stuart Mastersion)  and Sam (Johnny Depp) are slightly atypical, they are very talented people----in their own way. Their main problems stem from a society that does not  understand their artistic and free-spirited tendencies. Joon's patronizing doctor either wants to hospitalize her or put her into a group home. The housekeepers recommended by this psychiatrist did not work because they treated her as a task/object to perform, instead of an independent person.<br /><br />Benny (Aidian  Quinn) really tries to be a good brother, but he wants to protect Joon. He does not realize that she is much more capable of functioning than he  presumes her to be.  He has her best interests at heart, she is his  last family member and feels obligated to protect her. Coincidentally, he has a friend at the same mental hospital where Joon's doctor has admitting privileges, who says he does not want to be a housekeeper. Benny has grown up with the medical perspective of disability.<br /><br />Only later does he figure out that this approach is making him 'sick'. He has no life of his own and is always stressed. He also has no girlfriend to share things with.<br />.<br /> This behavior is not  atypical among parents and family with another member who has any kind of  disability. It is both inspiring and courageous for a major motion  picture to show a transformation of the characters from supporting medical to independent living that independent living perspectives.<br /><br />Sam and Joon end up the  perfect couple, and Benny starts to relax and finally also get a life of his own. Treating Joon as a person vs. a medical case is healthy for the entire family.<br /><br />The movie is charming. It capitalizes with the entertainment  world's fascination with the Pacific Northwest and the grunge scene of the early 1990's, showing a lot of great scenery and music Unlike so many movies today, the romance and intimacy scenes  are both romantic, obvious and tasteful.<br /><br />I did not intially appreciate how revolutionary it was to show a person with a disability having sexual activity.--but it does show this, as well as the all-to-real fall out when Benny discovers what Joon and Sam did, because he did not want to come to grips with her being an adult woman who would be interested in sexual relations.zes with the entertainment  world's fascination with the Pacific Northwest and the grunge scene of the early 1990's, showing a lot of great scenery and music Unlike so many movies today, the romance and intimacy scenes  are both romantic, obvious and tasteful.<br /><br />I did not intially appreciate how revolutionary it was to show a person with a disability having sexual activity.--but it does show this, as well as the all-to-real fall out when Benny discovers what Joon and Sam did, because he did not want to come to grips with her being an adult woman who would be interested in sexual relations.
B00000255F|5.0|A few simple piano notes open up Backstreets.  Then a thunderous crack of the drums and the song explodes.  Springsteen starts to sing, an old story about a lover lost, and he says things you've felt before.  &quot;At night  sometimes it seemed you could hear this whole city crying...Blame it all on  me, it don't matter to me now.&quot;<br /> To open the record, a harmonica  comes in and Springsteen, a 23 year old at the time, sings a song about  reaching for dreams and running away with someone, &quot;who ain't a  beauty, but hey, [she's] alright.&quot;<br /> The title track is a blast  off heroic rock song.  There it was laid down, every ounce of teen angst  expressed in one 5-minute song.  Listen to it, Born To Run.<br /> The rest of  the album plays out street-filled adrenaline music with lyrically intensive  canvass filling stories.  Springsteen, as a 23 year old, became the future  of rock and roll as he made that album.  It only takes a couple listens to  see why it's still called a classic today.
B000006TRV|5.0|Well, well, well ... I finally broke down and listened to this album with an open mind and I must say that I am amazed.  My first exposure to these guys was the movie of the same title.  After watching that movie, my idea  of them was &quot;Those guys are crazy!&quot;  So I gave up on ever  actually listening to them after that.  This was about 6 yrs. ago and I  regret my shallow misconception of a decision now.  I'm going to try to  watch that wierd movie again and maybe I'll appreciate it more now.  This  album is basically the journey through the mind of an honest man caught in  a deceitful world.  It paints a picture that is full of emotion.  I've  declared that the song &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is the best on the  album and works well with any mood you could possibly be in while listening  to it.  This album has something for everyone.  I can't really define it as  a rock album because it has a lot of contemporary and &quot;pop-like&quot;  tracks on it.  My advice is to just buy it because how can all those people  be wrong?
B000001TVD|2.0|i was very disappointed when i purchased this album, since i already had some of george clinton's other work (including the awesome Parliament's Funkentelechy VS. The Placebo Syndrome).  Even the most musically  illiterate people would know that this is not funk. From the monotonous  title track which is just one long Pink Floyd-esque guitar solo stretching  ten minutes to the long and uninspired &quot;Wars of Armageddon&quot;  everything is under average Clinton. The only exception is the interesting  and somewhat acoustic &quot;Can You Get To That&quot;. I respect George  Clinton's attempt to get serious, but what's the point if the outcome is  worthless? Do yourself a favor and buy a Parliament album instead.
B000003BDJ|5.0|This album is the absolute definition of what defines rock 'n' roll.  Sure you have your Led Zep and your Beatles, but Zeppelin was more bluesey and/or heavier (versatile), and The Beatles ... well I their music doesn't  give me the same feeling as The Stones does.  Being a listener of all types  of music, I decided to try The Stones out recently.  I bought this cd and a  couple of their other ones, and I have to say that I CAN'T pull them out of  my cd player!  I am a huge Zeppelin fan, and these guys are right up there  with them.  This is the type of stuff that you like right away!  It doesn't  have to grow on you at all.  Mick Jagger's singing style is amazing and  will really hypnotize you on &quot;Sympathy for the Devil.&quot;  Plain and  simple, get this cd if you like music.
0440219078|3.0|The book &quot;The Giver&quot; is about a young boy named Jonas,who lives in a perfect world:In his community,which assimilates to an isolated town,there doesn't exist neither pain or hunger nor crime or divorces.As he is selected as the new &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot; he can see that  there's nothing as it seems. We think &quot;The Giver&quot; isn't that  good.Our reasons for not loving that book are that we are two very  realistic girls and simply can't follow the storyline,because it's so  confusing.Maybe we have  too small of an imagination,but above all the  ending of the story doesn't really make sense and so many questions are  still left open.
0553108034|5.0|I had given up on fantasy trilogies,after getting worn out by Thomas Covenant,and the like. It hasn't been since Tolkein that I read a story that was so rich and textured that I looked forward to what happened to  each charactor. And there many, many charactors in this story, believe me.  I keep going to the sci-fi fantasy sections of book stores, looking for the  next book, without even knowing the name of the next one. This book is not  to be read all at once. It is written to be savored, once piece at a  time.If you want to read a great story, and have the patience, and don't  get turned off by a cast of thousands (literally), then this is the book  for you.

B00003CWN3|5.0|I was rooting for Annette Bening on Oscar night but I hadn't seen Swank play Brandon Teena.  After I did, I realized she mowed down every actress in competition with her for the 2000 Oscar race for 1999 films.  You could  swear Swank is a boy but, when you see her as a girl, you believe that  also, albeit as a girl who should have been born a boy.  In the love  scenes, Swank is especially convincing as a teen girl's boyfriend, which  hardly seems possible because she's really a girl herself.  This movie will  really shake you up though so I wouldn't advise seeing it at the end of a  bad day.  Brandon hangs around with mostly society's dregs in the heartland  and that forecasts her short future as much as her being born the wrong sex.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

The only reason I gave this record a 4 star rating is because I prefer  something a little faster. But if you are a Nirvana fan ( not just someone  who likes &quot; Smells like teen spirits&quot; ) then get all you money  together run down to your local record store as fast as you can, drop the  coins on the desk and ask for this record because it rocks!
0783114893|3.0|So young Jim Halsey tells the mysterious man he picks up from a deserted stretch of highway.  If only Jim had listened to Mom.<br />All you have to do is watch this movie once to understand why it's become a Cult Classic since  its release in 1986.  The story tells of the ultimate cat-and-mouse game  between a mysterious hitchhiker and an innocent he chooses to terrorize on  a cross country trip to California.  What happens along the way are events  that will keep you from EVER picking up a stranger!<br />This IS the movie  that launched Rutger Hauer's career.  His performance as the evil  hitchhiker (listen for his name towards the end of the movie) could not  have been played better by anyone else. C. Thomas Howell as Jim Halsey also  turns in a great performance.  Add the excellent directing style of Robert  Harmon's direction with the deserted stretches of Texas as the background,  and you've got a movie that still stands up as a timeless movie.<br />The  picture quality on the DVD is the best ever for this movie.  Color fidelity  and shadows are crisp and pleasing.  The DD soundtrack, on the other hand,  is quite disappointing.  Though the movie was released in Dolby Surround,  that is surely no excuse.  The rear channels are hardly ever used  effectively, and the entire movie sounds more like a 2 channel mix instead  of 5.1.  Still the movie sounds more defined than from a VHS source.  Also,  the extras are rather sparse.  A theatrical trailer and some cast  biographies are all you'll get.<br />Overall, I consider The Hitcher to be one  of the best movies of its genre.  If the DVD release had a better DD  soundtrack, I would have undoubtedly given it 1 more star.  After all,  isn't a Digital discrete soundtrack one of the joys of DVD?
0671015206|1.0|this book just tells people that they should save money and be frugal.  This may make you rich, but it will also make you gloomy for the rest of your life.  It takes away the pleasures of money.  What fun is all the  money in the world if you can not spend it
6305910103|4.0|A classic line in a classic movie.  This is undoubtedly classic Trek.  <br />For most fans of the Star Trek series, Star Trek II is the movie which set the standard for all the following films in the series.  Nicholas  Meyer's direction is a welcome change from ST:TMP, which plodded along,  even for die-hard Trek fans.  Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Khan is what  really steals the show, though.  His single-minded purpose of destroying  Adm. Kirk is both chilling and convincing.  Besides Star Trek 6 (also  directed by Meyer), this is the only Trek movie that feels we've  &quot;Boldly gone where no one has gone before.&quot; <br />The DVD edition is  a flawless transfer.  Its presentation is certainly the best transfer to  date, though the sound fidelity sounds dated at times.  However, even the  sound is the best you've ever heard on this film.  The only thing wanting  in this edition is more supplemental material.  Come on, Paramount, where's  the beef!   Though the theatrical trailer is a nice touch, the DVD could  have had some added cast biographies and interviews.  The sparse  supplemental material keeps me from giving this DVD a full 5  stars.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this film to Sci-Fi/Action/Trek fans  alike.  If Hollywood invested more time in movies like this, a lot more  people would be more satisfied in spending a day's pay at the theater.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Even if she's handed some of modern music's dumbest lyrics to sing, and even if her musical backdrop is still robotic, synthetic and possessing of all the spontaneity of a computer program, Britney Spears' latest is still  a deep-grooving, attractive dance album that aptly showcases Spears'  considerable charisma as a lead vocalist.<br />She may not be a great singer,  but she's certainly more robust than Madonna, and she more than carries the  vocal hooks with confidence and grace.  Backed with a multitude of backing  vocals, she sounds infectiously energetic, as on the title track and  &quot;Stronger&quot; -- the latter sporting a mighty chorus that is  sonically almost reminiscent of Janet Jackson in her Rhythm Nation heyday  (!).  Spears seems to be looking to expand her horizons as well, covering  &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (bold move, even if it's a shaky  proposition) and even pitching in with a songwriting credit on &quot;Dear  Diary&quot;.  While there's no telling whether this is just a way to get  her in on songwriting royalties (Elvis Presley never co-wrote on songs that  he nevertheless shared writing credits on, eg. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel), it  shows ambitions to extend beyond just a pretty factory-produced  vocalist/dancer for assembly-line-manufactured pop engineers.<br />I certainly  hope she'll go the distance and shake herself free of the faceless, limited  talents who are restricting her right now on the songwriting and production  fronts.  Who knows?  Perhaps her next step would be a declaration of  independence rivalling Janet Jackson's on Control and Rhythm Nation.
B00003Q43A|5.0|&quot;They'll be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes.&quot;  HAD to put this in!  This is undoubtedly one of the most fun sci-fi movies in history.  The tale starts with a ship roughly 1/4 size of the moon  entering orbit of earth, only to send down multiple city sized ships to our  cities to wipe out humanity.  This is one of those movies where you won't  realize you've spent nearly 3 hours in front of your set.  In fact, you'll  probably want more!<br />Though this is not one of your &quot;great  thinker&quot; movies, it's not really meant to be.  From Dean Devlin  himself (Producer), it's really a &quot;popcorn movie.&quot;  Sit down, eat  your popcorn, and enjoy the ride.  If you want thought, Amazon.com has 2001  for sale, too.  Nonetheless, this movie still succeeds.  The story is fun  and easy to follow, the characters are believable (and equally fun to  watch!), and the special effects are still (4 years later) among the best  you'll ever see.  <br />This DVD release is great, too, because it gives you  the option to play the theatrical or the special edition versions.   Personally, I like the theatrical better, simply because the editing is  done more smoothly.  The special edition edits sometimes seem a bit rough,  but the scenes are still worth watching.  Also, the movie in DD is a  serious treat!<br />Supplemental material, you ask?  You got it, and LOTS of  it!  You've got ALL the trailers and TV spots, some cool interviews and  movie specials, and more.  For the price of the disc, you can't beat this  deal.<br />For sheer fun value, Independence Day sure delivers, and the DVD  transfer (superb color and shadow details, with a pleasing 5.1 surround  mix) is sure to make you thankful for your investment in a player.  This  disc is recommended in every way.

0743200799|5.0|Much has been said about the quality of the writing of this book, and better words than mine have described the actual content and its unique perspective.  It should be noted that the book reads very much in the voice  of Gene Kranz.  If you knew him or had seen him on the mission video feeds  or press conferences you could close your eyes and hear his voice as you  read the words in the book.<br />This is definitely a fascinating read -  especially for those of us who grew up in the shadow of the Johnson Space  Center and who knew many of these players personally.

1563894696|5.0|People always ask themselves the question what is it about the Dark Knight  that makes him one of the most enduring and popular characters of our time?  This wonderfully scripted trade paperback edition of the Long Halloween  points to the answer. The book delves deeply into the criminal elemant of  Gotham and bring out the best of Batman, who you see very little of when it  come to the action scenes, but a lot of in scenes depicting conversation.  The mood is very dark in this comic and reminisces the first Batman movie  by Tim Burton. Batman sticks to the shadows and you just can't help but  feel intimidated when he slowly walks out. The element of fear has always  been the Bat's strongest features and this book really shines through when  it comes to that. The coloring by Gregory Wright suits the mood so well  that yopu feel as if you're that third person looking at things from behind  a lens. Tim Sale is without a doubt one of the most promising talents out  there. His soft, smooth approach to the characters makes better than the  detailed, cartoony features that have become the norm in this day and age.  Jeph Loeb scripts one of his best stories in there and you can interact  with the characters and understant their expectations and wants. The story  is suspenseful, thrilling with action in just the right places. Loeb brings  out half of Batman's rogue gallery and portrays them right without them  overstaying their welcome through and through.<br />If you're a fan of Batman,  his first movie and the Godfather all put into one, you'll never put this  book down (I read it continuously without a break). If you're just a Batman  fan, then You'll be seeing the character written at his best.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|More than twenty years in the business is a lot for a band or any musician for that matter. The trend these days is to produce gimmick artists that are here now and gone tomorrow. These artists should be as volatile as the  audience that listens to them. How do you explain it then that a band of  more than 20 years still has the ability to turn heads and receive much  appraise in a music medium considered these days as good as dead. This is  Iron Maiden, perhaps, the greatest metal band to ever grace the industry  since their inception in bassist Steve Harris's mind.<br />Their new album  comes fresh off their last somwhat brooding two albums. It seems with their  classic vocalist of more than 10 years, Bruce Dickinson, IM tried to break  new ground with a different singer, that can be considered the opposite  coin of Bruce's, Blaze Bayley. While Bruce was optimistic, Blaze was down  right brooding. When Bruce was operatic, Blaze was churning through as if  menacing in catacombs with the dead. This change received great downright  reviews for the band, which the band answered back in their song  Virus.<br />Harris knew that things were not going too well with his little  band of misfits. Harris loves what he does and loves what his band has  achieved throughout and just did not want to see everything wasted through  that. He somehow tries top cajole Bruce back and it works. I don't know why  Bruce left Maiden to continue as a solo artist, but bringing him back sure  brought the magic. Bruce has matured in his own stance and was ready to  bring on the needed, &quot;fresher&quot; blood into the band that made him  famous to this day. The ace under Bruce's sleeve was to bring in old  bandmate Adrian Smith, who has been touring with him during his last couple  of albums into the foray of IM once again. The band already had Janik Gers  as a member and kicking him out just because Adrian was coming showed a  sign of disrespect to an artist that has witnessed IM's up and down and  been with them in their hour of need. This brought a tally of three guitars  in the band.<br />Their new album, Brave New World, is vintage Maiden. It has  the right amount of melody, the right amount of riffs and the right amount  dedication by all band memebers. All of them, with the exception of Nicko,  played a role in devising the songs and though Harris is credited more than  anyone in that album, it was great the amount of time and dedication the  old new members were dishing out. This produced an album that takes off  slow and progresses into a jamming 67 minutes that just can't be topped.  There are people who say that Maiden's album is not classic as their old  ones. It may seem true at the beginning, but these songs' lyrics have a  much more mature tone to them. The band had the creative control of  bringing out the best sound of metal at a time when the once old speed  metal bands were experimenting with hard rock/pop.<br />The highlight of the  album can very well be the song NOMAD, which hold a very strong connection  to POWERSLAVE. The middle piece of guitar is beautiful sounding that it can  pump you up or relax you according to whatever you are feeling at the time.  It sends you on a feeling that you're on a horse and ready to go at it and  take names later.<br />All in all the album is great, music wise and lyric  wise. The downside of everything is the fact that people tend to compare  all the guitarist and hold a negative look upon Gers. All the guitarists  have their own styles and though Dave and Adrian go well together with  their solos, Gers just is the most spontaneous and willing to break new  grounds with his music. He is very underrated in the eyes of many IM fans  and have him as the reason for the band's downfall, where he truly did not.  Most of the albums songs were written by him when compared to those written  by the other guitarists.<br />The boys still have a lot more in their heads  that can insure us that there will bemany great albums to come. These guys  love their job and most of all they love their fans. I have never seen  band/fan interaction better displayed in any other band that's better than  IM's. They hold great respect for them and know full well how to please  them. Same they have been doing for the past 20 years or so. By making us  feel good.
B00000ILBK|2.0|This is really a TV movie which doesn't have a story to tell. The &quot;exploitation of the fountain of youth&quot; plot was one of the weaker ones from the original series (&quot;Omega Glory&quot;), so it's  surprising that the producers would choose to recycle it for a movie. The  writers attempt to comment on America's &quot;forced relocation&quot; of  Japanese Americans during World War 2, but it comes across as forced and  awkward in this setting. The love story between the Baku woman and Picard  is about as romantic as stale toast. Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham is  totally wasted as a villain with some major skin problems. Troy and Riker  get to play on the set rather than act. As usual, Data saves the day with  some funny lines, but it's not enough to save this ill-conceived project.  Disappointing after the fun and adventure of &quot;First Contact.&quot;
B00003Q43A|1.0|Stargate, ID4, Godzilla and now the Patriot have all the same characteristic: they are lousy films made by the same incompetent director, Emmerich. SOMEBODY SHOULD STOP THIS GUY FROM MAKING MORE MOVIES, SOMEBODY  SHOULD DO SOMETHING PLEASE!
0446605409|5.0|This was my first DeMille novel, but it won't be my last.  I have never read a mystery/thriller where the detective was more sarcastic and/or funny than John Corey.  I encourage everyone to pick up this book, but beware,  after a few pages there won't be any turning back.
B00004TH83|5.0|When the first single Adagio came out in Europe, I kept wondering who that vocalist was because she sounded so much like Celine Dion. One day I decided to listen to the cd on a record store and after listening to the  very first lines of track 1, I picked it up and bought it. As I listened it  through, I was totally amazed by Lara's talent. From the very first time I  heard 'I Will Love Again', I knew it'd be a hit on the dance-club charts  and it was indeed. Love By Grace is another amazing song and one of her  favorites, You Are My Heart is touching and then the rest you have to  figure out for yourself. It's just so worth having it. I have been playing  it on and on for almost 6 months now only to find out about her French  material. Pure is an unbelievable album, but if you have a chace to check  Carpe Diem, don't hesitate! The first track 'Puisque c'est l'amour' is  a  true demonstration of her talent, of the way she can use her voice and  reach you. 'Leila' is another example of the diversity that runs in Lara,  she mixes rhythms and excites you with every song. She's definitely another  DIVA that just exploded in America, but was already en route to conquer the  world.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I can't say enough about this CD. It's truly amazing. At first, you won't see it, but with afew more listenings it will grow on you. <br />It's hard to compare PJ albums, but this one ranks with the finest (&quot;Ten,&quot;  &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Vitalogy&quot;). Each one is different and original,  but always great. You can't go wrong with Pearl Jam.
B000002VCB|4.0|I was in the dark about what Alan Parsons Project were or was about; the only popular song I remember as a kid was Eye In The Sky. After Eye in the Sky I thought all music created and performed by the Alan Parsons Project  was mellow light rock; WRONG ! Having recently purchased their Eve album I  discovered what I missed all these years. Even the album cover is  interesting with the cover models wearing hats and veils which is a  throwback to the fashions of the 40's and 50's golden era of Hollywood(  Anyone remember actress Bette Davis in All About Eve ?).The album is  faintly reminiscent of Pink Floyd (progressive sound) and E.L.O (rock music  combined with symphonic or orchestral music).<br />What prompted me to  purchase Eve was when I first heard a cover of the instrumental Lucifer  performed by T.A.A.W (an Enigma, Michael Cretu side-project). While the  song is basically a 90's up-to-date version infused w/ techno, it still  contains the strong Parsons melody.<br />This is definitely a keeper for  anyone's varied and wide c.d. collection !
078324228X|4.0|What is the proof that The Hurricane is such a great film?  Above all other reasons is this:  It has inspired so much heated controversy.  If it was dull, poorly written, and badly acted, no one would care to hate it  with the vigor that its most strident critics do.  <br />But know this from  the start: unlike its stranch fans whose reviews appear below claim, it is  NOT a true story.  It is a fictionalization of a real person.  Without  exception, not one scene of the film actually happened the way Norman  Jewison's direction portrays it.  And very few scenes are even remotely  close to real events. You cannot fault Jewison or his screenwriters with  taking such liberties with actual events any more than you can fault Monet  or Picasso for not producing paintings that look like Koda-crome prints.   Jewison is an artist, not a historian; a storyteller, not a court  reporter.<br />Also keep in mind that the film is based on Carter's book (and  the Canadians', too) so it is not a master stroke of objectivity.  Many of  the sorted details of Carter's life are purposefully left out.  By some  definitions, Carter could fairly be said to be a &quot;career  criminal.&quot;  His boxing career is very overstated. (He had a pro record  of merely 27-12-1 and he was soundly beaten in his middleweight  championship bout of 1964. <br />The portrayal of the legal battles is very  simplistic in the film.  But again, don't blame Jewison for his choices  here.  The real legal history of the case is rather dry and technical.  He  was never &quot;proven&quot; not guilty.  Rather, the federal court found  that his second trial was not a fair one, and thus he was never correctly  found to be guilty in the first place.  NJ could have tried him a third  time, but declined to do so.  (And he was released from prison for over a  year between the two trials.)<br />Still Carter's case is a compelling story,  and with a little adjusting and rearranging, makes good drama.  The  greatness of thefilm is its art. It is superbly acted, and Jewison does a  wonderful job keeping the focus tightly on the Lasra/Rubin relationship. So  what if he weaves the activities of hundreds of real life people in the  case into a composited of about into about ten film characters.  So does  the film &quot;A Civil Action.&quot;<br />And there is some very real  reasonable doubt about whether Carter committed these murders.  The  internet abounds with sites that claim that he is a guilty man walking  free.  That claim is highly suspect, especially since most of the eye  witnesses (including one victim) failed to identify Carter as the killer  even when shown his face (in an investigation procedure that is now illegal  in the U.S.) within hours of the murders. <br />Was Carter guilty or innocent?   This movie is not the place to go to seek an answer to that question.  The  question the movie does answer is more important than that specific  question.  It tells us that in this country, our sadistic lust to blame  people we think might be guilty or we merely want to be guilty can and does  easily cause us to convict and punish the innocent.  Don't fool yourself:   It happens every day.  Only courage and love can allow us to overcome our  hateful temptations.
B00004THAY|3.0|B.B. King and Eric Clapton are both up there among the worlds finest blues men, each in his own right. And that, I think, is the problem with this album. Technically, it's top notch but somehow the two doesn't quite meet  on the middle. There's a disconnect somewhere. It's slick and blue but  without the nerve and intensity vital for the blues to sprout wings and  take off. The three stars are for the technical merits. The missing two for  the lack of conviction. This album just doesn't get under my skin. Sorry  guys...

0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is an exceptional book.  From the moment I began reading it, I fould it hard to put it down.  The book gives a poignant recount of a girl's battle with depression.  I thought it was a very moving, touching,  and sometimes even humorous story.  It was at no time dull or boring.  I  highly recommend it.
B000000OY9|2.0|This is perhaps the only neil young album I can think that I can honestly say you shouldn't bother with. It's still neil, so its not all bad (the stand out track , hippie dream, is excellent), but the overwhelming majority of these songs just flat don't work. The biggest thing this album has going for it is its low price. Since its so cheap, its almost worth picking up just to satisfy your curiousity. Just don't expect it to be a constant fixture in your daily listening. If you want to check out neil's experimental period, you're much better off checking out trans...
B000005IU1|5.0|This album opened my eyes and ears to what ROCK AND ROLL was really about.  Iggy, the Brothers Asheton and Dave put together the best, most basic songs for this album and John Cale or not (no insult intended toward John)  they burst out of the recording with a ferocious and angry sound that made  me NEEEEED MORE! <br />The feedback at the beginning of I Wanna Be Your Dog  is trend setting, the attitude of Not Right is just right.  I don't listen  to We Will Fall, but the rest of the album makes for the one of the best  rock albums of all time and the BEST of 1969.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is about Jonas, a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect world - with no illness, no crime, and no individuality.  When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned a job as the Receiver of Memories for the community.   <br />Through his assigned profession he learns there is more to life than  sameness.  He discovers colors, feel, pain, love, war, and much more.  Soon  Jonas becomes discontent with his simple life in his simple community and  goes on a quest looking for a world that can provide more.<br />The Giver  captures the pricelessness of individuality and the cost that some  societies have to pay to be different.  This is one of the few remarkable  Newberies that EVERYONE should read.  I strongly recommend this incredible  book.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|&quot;I went out and recorded my own demo..&quot; This is what she said on television. I wonder if her voice on that demo was as studio-enhanced as on this, her first album.  I guess good looks will get you to high places.   What saves this album, are its special guest artists. If not for that, this  was an over-hyped debut. I didn't buy this CD, it was a gift. But man,  would I have been pretty upset.  I think someone nailed it right on the  head earlier-Where is her voice? still On the 6?
6303418287|4.0|As film adaptions of Frankenstein go, this is more accurate than most. It's good to see the Arctic climax restored, as it is so often omitted. Kenneth Branagh has made a satisfying, staightforward version of the story,  thankfully containing little of the wayward characterisation and tricksy  camera work which combine to sink Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. The  horror element has been toned down a bit, although the section where  Frankenstein ressurects Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) is quite  disturbing.<br />Just a word about the creation scene, which is somewhat  different to the 'thunder and lightning' scenario we have become used to.  The monster floats in a tank full of amniotic fluid, which Frankenstein  moves about the laboratory by means of chains and pulleys. The spark of  life is provided by power generated from electric eels. Frankenstein,  stripped to the waist, slips and slides on the fluid that has now poured  onto the floor, and strikes the monster on the back, in the manner of a  doctor slapping a new-born baby. It certainly gives a novel slant to a  familiar situation.<br />Branagh directs and also plays the part of  Frankenstein with energy and gusto. Robert DeNiro makes a formidable  monster, but also manages to elicit our sympathy for his plight, which is  just how it should be. The supporting performances from a host of well  known British actors are generally good, perhaps the most interesting being  John Cleese. He does well in a straight role as Dr. Waldemann, who takes  Frankenstein under his wing at medical school. The comic relief is provided  by Tom Hulce as Frankenstein's friend, Henry Clerval.<br />This is a good and  entertaining version of Frankenstein, and well worth a look.
B00003Q43A|4.0|This DVD is a must have for home theatre enthusists.  The sound is great.  The move is much the same as it ever was.  Weak story but good special efects.  Its just a fun move that just about anyone can enjoy.
0688170528|4.0|This is a book that stays with you after you finish, and you're sad when it's over. The characters become very real -- so much so that you'll wish you could help them to feel better. Having said that, it's a good length,  you can finish it without losing a week of your life.
B00004TDTO|5.0|It was wonderful to see my favorite scene again...the one where Roy Scheider is chumming and the shark pops up to say hello. I thought the idea of releasing this 25th anniversary DVD was fantastic. (I just wish they  would also do a short term theatrical re-release, also. Ah, to see it on  the big screen again!) This DVD is well worth buying.
0792156684|1.0|I'm sorry to all of the people out there that loved this movie, but it stank.  It started off as a classic love story, nothing original really, it went on to reiterate the same poor-little-rich-girl syndrom as Dirty  Dancing, even going so far as to repeat the accusations of thievery. This  was all very cliche, but nothing too terrible.  Then the narrative stopped.   It didn't just shift to some other action, it just stopped in the middle  of the movie so that the boat could sink.  The scenes while the boat sank  were wonderful and touching (the bit with the band was beatiful) but they  had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  90% of the scenes in the 1  hour period in which the boat was sinking had absolutely nothing to do with  the plot.  They could have easily been put together before the studio got  the script in the mail.  The makers of this movie just couldn't decide  whether they wanted to make a movie about a sinking boat ( which they would  have done well at) or about a poor little rich girl (which they also would  have done well at) but in the agony of indecision, they worte a love story  in the middle of which a boat happened to sink. it was disastrous.
6303014100|5.0|I have seen this film muliple times and it never ceases to move me.  It is not a &quot;war movie&quot;.  It isn't as much about the battle as the men who fought it.  Tired cliche it may be--but in this film they really do  come to life.  I found myself riveted--pulled in.  My favorite portrayals  are those of the exuberant George Pickett, and Martin Sheen's so soulful  Lee.  And the powerful musical score just crowns everything--it stays with  you long after the movie's over.  I recommend it highly.

B000000OMB|5.0|Old Asia was great, wasn't it?  I've had this album for several years now and it's still one of the best CD's in my collection.  To me all three of Asia's albums are gems.  Steve Howe's aggressive guitars combined with  Geoff Down's elegant and at times catchy keyboard playing, not to mention  the killer choruses, make this and all their albums come alive.  There are  no real highlights on this album because all the songs are GREAT!  To me  none of them stand out any more than the others.  The only song I don't  like quite as much as the rest of the tracks is &quot;One Step  Closer.&quot;  But even that song is no slouch.  Any fans out there of  progressive rock don't pass this one up!
0316777722|4.0|This is the first time I've ever experienced any of David Sedaris' work. Some stories were more hysterical than others, but overall it was really refreshing. Sedaris is dark and critical of almost everything, including  himself. He has the gift of looking at completely ordinary things and  describing it in a way that paints hilarious. (i.e. when he scores low on  his IQ test, he describes it as about the dollar amount to buy 3 buckets of  chicken.) I did find it strange however, how the book ends so abruptly, and  also how he manages to make himself look like such pure loser. He never  discusses his success in radio or writing. (I guess going on and on about  how successful you are just isn't as funny.)
0345403959|1.0|The Belgariad began with a wonderful, original and insightful story, with unique characters who had a vast potential for personality growth.  By the time Eddings reaches Belgarath the Sorcerer, however, the quality has  plummeted into nothing more than trite, overused words filling the pages.   The story itself had so much potential, but the writing and characters were  written so poorly that the book was difficult to read without becoming  frustrated.  The author attempts to make the narrative amusing with smart  comments and the like, but what this actually achieves is making Belgarath  the sorcerer, the powerful, insightful, complex man, into a peevish,  cranky, one-dimensional character.  What's more, the characters have all  become flat and dull - the dialogue that springs from the mouth of any  character could just as easily come from any other, with its weak attempts  at sharp tongued witticisms and hopeless characterization.  All females are  portrayed as manipulative; all males are portrayed as hot tempered  lunkheads.  Do yourself a favour:  If you enjoyed the belgariad, don't  bother with this book as it will ruin the entire experience for you.
0375703764|4.0|Where are you right now?  Are you sitting in your office? your bedroom? a library? a study?  Or are you anywhere you can really describe?  Now, just look at these words and think about nothing else except these words and  what you might be in for if you read HOUSE OF LEAVES.  Are you blocking out  the edges of your peripheral vision yet?  Until you do, then you do not  know what this book could even possibly be about.  It's an exercise in  psychology . . . the discomfort of not knowing what you cannot know . . .  or not wanting to know what you do know . . . or knowing it and knowing  that you know it and want to know it but pretending that you either don't  actually know it or don't really want to know it (even though you do).   There are several layers to this novel.  There are several parallel  stories, each of which is interesting on its own terms.  Each of the  stories is incomplete, not that this fact really matters because each might  be as complete as possible or not incomplete at all.  Incidentally, the  novel is decent in spite of itself.  Danielewski, Truant, Zampano, and  Navidson (the parties responsible for this work) are each a bit  self-indulgent on a regular basis (or is Danielewski strictly taking the  satire to an even deeper level?).  Ultimately, you actually know the answer  . . . even though you really don't . . .
6305750750|5.0|The Phantom Menace is a wonderful movie, I reccomend it wholeheartedly. The Boxed Set is especially fun, for me at least, you get a small strip of film and a little art book (enthralling for artists!) not to mention better  quality movie. My only note is to -please- make sure you've watched the  original trilogy... One of my friends that had only watched the Phantom  Menace gave me such a startled look when I broke the news that little  Anikin grows up to be Darth Vader!
0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand may get too philosophical at times throughout this novel but never strays from relaying her ideas through Howard Roark, Peter Keating, Dominique Francon and all the multi-layered characters.  It was the  contrast of these characters that kept me involved in this novel.  Rand  quite beautifully sets her characters up as opposites to one another and  then through intense characterization explores how these opposites interact  with one another.  Setting these complex people up against the competative  world of architecture shows just how confused and interesting these  characters can be.     Be prepared for some intense thinking when you get  ready to read this book.
B00004THAY|5.0|Loved it!  B.B.King and Eric Clapton are just the best you can get!  I have everything Eric ever did and most of B.B.Kings' so I feel like I know them both.  I'm a Mississippi native and grew up with the Blues so this  takes me back to a simpler time and place.  It's a must buy!
B00000IL1K|5.0|Uplifting and truly beautiful, favorites include, &quot;Only An Ocean Away&quot;, and &quot;Deliver Me.&quot; The entire CD is very well done. Classically and artistically sound. There is a strong sense of passion that  Sarah Brightman brings to her audience and yet it is passion tempered with  immense vocal talent. A truly beautiful and engaging CD, worth the  purchase!
B000002VC3|3.0|Producer/songwriter/musician Alan Parsons had a smart idea; that is, write and produce albums without a band. There is no Alan Parsons' Band proper, just a rotating group of musicians. Several are steady performers  throughout Parsons' ten album Project. Eye In The Sky makes heavy use of an  orchestra, choir and the \\"sounds like everything and anything\\" fairlight -  hence the album is often tagged \\"art' and \\"progressive.\\" Overall, Eye In  The Sky is rhythm-driven light rock. Whether provided by the bass guitar  (Eye In The Sky), rhythm guitar (You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned) or  drums; most compositions are compulsory toe-tappers. \\"Psychobabble\\" is a  bass guitar lover's dream - David Paton's work is brilliant and  arousing.<br />Parsons' approach is highly structured, prim and proper; and  his compositions often come-off as \\"calculated\\" rather than \\"loose.\\"  \\"Loose\\" is not in Alan Parsons' dictionary. With its fairlight programmed  rhythm, the instrumental `Mammagamma' touches on disco. The fiery rocker  `You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned' is a welcome change of pace to the  band's normally reserved playing. The most tantalizing composition is the  sentimental ballad `Old And Wise.' Zombie Colin Blunstone provides lead  vocals. His smoky and hushed voice is one of the most provocative in  popular music. Like all of The Eye In The Sky, `Old And Wise' is lush and  multi-textured.<br />Technical Note: Eye In The Sky is one of the fist digital  recordings (using the Sony PCM 1610 System). I suspect that the mix is  analog; therefore, the result is also analog. Arista could have sought the  first-generation recordings and produced a true DDD disc. Keep your fingers  crossed for a digital remaster.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Yield was my fav.P.J. record to date with 3 or 4 of their very best songs ever(In Hiding,Do The Evolution,Brain of J,&amp; the superb Faithful.After a few plays of Binaural I thought it did not reach the heights of  Yield..but whats now typical of a P.J. album...it GROWS AND GROWS. The  songs get under your skin..this aint Korn or Limp Biskit or whatever..this  group have matured over the last 3 albums its unbelievable. Sleigh of Hand,  Of the Girl, Light Years, these are masterpieces while Grievance,  Insignificance, OH HECK there is absolutely no dud on Binaural. Perhaps  placing Soon Forget and Parting Ways together at the albums end isnt the  best choice but , small crib! Altogether this collection puts Binaural, in  my opinion, their most mature and consistent album todate and they are  without doubt the only true rock group around at the moment.LONG MAY THEY  RECORD AND TOUR.And &quot;Whats the point? Your right Eddie, its a really  great place to play in Dublin.!

6304119046|5.0|Not a review, but a quick observation. In reading many of the reviews (pro and con) on CITIZEN KANE one element becomes clear. Just about every body is disturbed to some degree by this film. Why? Because Welles cuts to the  very center of what is to be a human being. No one, I think, starts out  with the premise  \\"I'm going to be a bad person\\". Kane, is propelled in the  beginning by a need to do good and gets done in the end by his obsessive  desire for power, wealth, material goods, control, love and adulation.  Shaped by events in his early childhood he is incapable of giving or  receiving  love.  In this respect, Orson Welles, has created a tragedy in  the classic tradition of the Greeks or of Shakespeare. Charles Foster Kane  is specify symbolic for each of us as individuals and in general for an  American society, where we have more and more of everything material and  less and less of  the humanity and love which makes a civilization great.  So, CITIZEN KANE is most defiantly NOT a period piece, but a timeless  warning to all, on the dangers of losing our very souls!

B000002UAX|4.0|The White Album was a revelation for me. Before its release, I thought that the Beatles were one entity, one musical force, one distinctive sound. With each song, all I heard was the Beatles sound: it was like a huge wave  coming directly from the speakers. I never stopped to consider exactly  \\"who\\" was singing, mush less \\"who\\" composed each song. The White Album made  me realize that the Beatles were four separate and unique people with  different styles and visions. For the first time I heard the solo efforts  of John, Paul, George and Ringo. John is an angry rebellious teenaged  rocker, Paul is one of the finest melody writers in popular music, George  is on a musical transcendental trip of innerpeace, and Ringo is the world's  luckiest drummer. The possibility that each was capable of writing and  performing their own songs was an eye opener.<br />Although the White Album  signaled the end of the Beatles, it was not a precursor to the \\"end of  rock'n'roll.\\" John, Paul, George and Ringo, no longer blood brothers  handcuffed together, later went on to pursue their own goals. The White  Album is both joyful and disheartening. Happy because it's time for each  member to leave the comfort and security of the Beatles, and go the road  alone. And bittersweet because the exalted Beatles' sound, that  awe-inspiring aural wave, had to end at sometime. Whoever said that \\"the  whole is greater than the sum of the parts\\" must have been thinking about  the Beatles. They must have owned a copy of the White Album.
B00003CWLE|5.0|Brilliant. The plots and pictures are close to perfect except the fact that the real palace looks better than in the movie, and the ship looks better than the ship in the movie. As a Thai citizen, it should be better  if people in the movie could speak Thai better since there are some words  which I still do not understand even it is my language. I would have to say  that Chow Yun Fat is very successful in this movie. The costume is great(  almost close to the real costume during that time period). Jodie Foster is  doing fine. However, I thought the movie is exaggerating the realities  about the love between King and Anna just because during that time a few  British came to my country. British people look strange to Thai people, so  I do not believe that much in love plot which probably makes the movie a  bit more interesting. This is the best movie I have seen in this  year!....and it should be considered the best movie. Another good movie is  Broken Palace. The movie is also about Thailand. Both of them are in the  same rating.

6305263248|4.0|In the post cold war era, many government spooks became freelance or mercenary.  Five of these people find themselves in the employ of an Irish woman, who is reluctant to identify her principle partner.  The task is the  retrieval of a case, the contents of which are unknown to the team hired  for the job.  At least, most of the team doesn't know what is in the  case.<br /> The team quickly tests each other to see who each believes  they can trust, and who can be counted on.  All of their trusts and  concerns are put to the test when their job doesn't go as planed.<br />  Ronin was the best action movie of 1998.  It was suspenseful, had nice  scenery, and most admirably, it commonly obeyed the laws of physics.  For  the most part, things only exploded when acted upon by explosives;  People  dropped like a bag of potatoes when killed by gunfire;  With only one  exception, cars impacted allot without any random or unexplained  explosions.  I appreciate realism.  The acting was good, but it was  expected of the lineup.<br /> Robert De Niro (Academy Award Winner for  &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;) plays an  American who needs the money from the job in question.  Jean Reno  (&quot;Leon&quot; aka &quot;The Professional&quot;, &quot;La Femme  Nikita&quot;, &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;) plays a Frenchman who knows  who will keep him alive.  Stellan Skarsgard (&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;,  &quot;Aberdeen&quot;) plays an ex KGB electronics specialist.  Jonathan  Pryce (&quot;Brazil&quot;, Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Something  Wicked This Way Comes&quot;) plays an Irish nationalist who will do as much  as any other person to take possession of the case.<br /> The best factor  of this film is the tangled web created by so many parties with interest in  the case, what they do to protect themselves, and what they do to obtain  the case.  The movie is very careful to supply the audience with all of the  relevant information, and to withhold most of the irrelevant information.  The character development was somewhat simple, but as complicated as it  needed to be to support the complications in the story.  It kept me on the  edge of my seat when I saw it in the theaters, and it did a fair job when I  recently viewed it on DVD.<br /> There were a few shortcomings in this  movie.  It did not always avoid the spy movie clich&eacute;.  I felt that the car  chase in Paris went on far too long, and was very unoriginal.<br />8.5 on a  scale of 10.<br /> Daniel Sanford,<br />-freelance reviewerld most of the irrelevant information.
