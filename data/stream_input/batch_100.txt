B00NLD32XA|4|This works great for people who need a strapless bra but can't, or don't want to, wear underwire.  It definitely stays put.  I don't find it as comfortable as a bra with straps, but it is supportive, and serves the purpose on my 36D body.  I ordered a 36C in lieu of a 36D, and it works, so the cups are somewhat generous.  The cup fits my D cup body fine.
B00BNAL97E|1|I bought this product for my girlfriend because I thought it looked really hot. I helped her with a hook on the back, but within a couple of minutes the fabric between the cups on the front had torn. We were both disappointed and I attempted to reattach the fabric with some crazy glue. Frankly, I messed it up enough to make the product  un-returnable. We wrote the whole idea off.
B008B7J5DM|3|But the top is worthless.  Skimpy is fine, but this thing flat out doesn't fit well.  Very strange fit and I'm not even well endowed.
B00AWMQDGG|4|I wore this dress to a wedding I had nothing to wear I bought this last minute online and hoped for the best. pared it with patten leather peak toe heels basically looked really pretty.
B002DYY19W|4|Nice hat. Great fit.
B000UU8ALG|5|This is a classic, clean cut coat.  A nice surprise is that it is heavier than I thought it would be so it hangs well and the skirt part is not full. Closures are rich looking, too.  It was difficult to find locally what I wanted in a coat but found that this one is perfect in every way including the fantastic low price!  The ONLY thing I would suggest is to get one size larger as it seems to run a bit small.  You will need to allow for extra room if you intend on wearing heavy sweaters, etc., under it.
B00G9TS7T2|4|I bought two different 513 styles in the same size. One was slightly loose. These pants were tight.  Had to let them out. Otherwise good.  Levis fit that you can wear to work.
B00I3G481K|1|The dress didn't look anything like the picture. The shade of yellow was a pukey-mustard. The style was slightly different, and the sizing chart was way off. It was supposed to be for my sister's wedding and I had to find something else to use, because it was a huge disappointment. Huge pain in the rump. -30 out of 10. Would not recommend.
B00MTKF2E8|5|i didn't expect that i'd love this so much.  the materials feels like a brushed silk.  though no weight to speak of, the design & effect is totally worth the low price.  size is as stated.
B00CAAJ24S|1|Too long and I have to have them taylored. Should hsve bought them in town. Needed them for this weekend. Grrrr.
B008NZTX34|5|I ordered this item and it came as promised. The item arrived on time and the quality was pretty good. I ordered another one for my girlfriend. Been using my belt pretty regularly and its holding up pretty good for a couple of months now. Will order again in the future.
B008AEE2F2|5|Love this with my skinny jeans or leggings. I do tend to itch when I wear this but then it goes away as time flies.
B00JQASOJO|4|So comfy and light weight for not to cold temps. 4 stars because it runs narrow
B005OBCY7W|5|This is the only bra my wife will order now.  She loves the fit and no loose tags to irritate.  The last one she had for over a year and wore it often so this time she bought 2.
B00BO0WZ12|2|I bought this as a spa present for my sister.  I washed it ONE time and it fell apart.  I thought that it might have from the reviews so I was prepared.  Lucky for me I have a sewing machine and was able to stitch it back together prior to her birthday.  Looks ghetto though because I had no white thread.<br /><br />Only buy this if you understand that you will have to sew it back together when it shreds.
B0035QQO2O|5|I bought this to go under a crochet top, but have ended up using it for dresses and other shirts!  Mind you; it's SHEER when stretched.  It's not meant to wear by itself.  But it's perfect for a little extra modesty.
B00JY7JC6S|4|These are a great substitute if you have kids that have to wear uniforms to school but you don't want to buy main line drab uniform wear.  My son usually needs a slim fit so make sure you get a belt to go with these if that is the case other wise great product that hold up well to the active nature of little boys :).
B00JAFEPKC|5|Great product.
B0042GM5G0|5|Looks just as the picture described. Sized normally for a guy. Came in a timely manner, seems to be god quality material. Great product!
B009GHNIXY|3|Bought this item for my son's Dr. Who costume. It was too big but still nice quality and looked cute on him.
B00G9G58A6|5|Given to a cancer patient as a holiday gift
B004GXA71O|1|I hate, hate, HATE this bra.<br />I washed it as soon as I got it.  So that it would feel nice and soft and not itchy.<br />The first time I wore it, I itched terribly.<br />So I washed it.  Twice. With fabric softener.<br />The second time I wore it, I itched terribly.<br />So I washed it. With every single load of laundry I did for about 2 weeks.<br />The third time I wore it, I itched terribly.<br />So I threw it out.<br /><br />It fit nicely, the color was adorable, but it made my knockers (yes, I did just refer to my breasts as my knockers) itch so badly that I wanted to cry.  I'm sure everyone else at the gym thought I was insane.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this bra.  If you feel that you must buy this bra, you can try a cheap trial run.  Take a sports bra that you own that fits you well and has excellent support.  Line the inside of it with fine grade sandpaper. Put it on.  Find a mound of fire ants.  Catch as many of them as you can.  Put them in your bra.<br />If you enjoy how that feels, than this is the bra for you!
B00PAATDUI|5|Love my snoozies 💚
B00JJ5FY9O|4|I followed the size chart exactly but the shirt I got was still too large for me. Still a nice shirt nonetheless.
B004QTQ8EI|4|A little too big on top (I'm small-chested) but I'm keeping it because it is very cute and it's not that noticeable that it doesn't fit perfectly.
B004XV2KQO|5|If you like a little extra room for for your little buddy these are great.  They are true to size.  Soft fabric and a sturdy elastic band.  They feel good.
B005P68KDI|5|The headbands and bows are of great quality and I love all the color choices.  It has been a lot of fun matching the headband to my babies outfits.
B001CP258W|4|I bought this costume to use in a theater production.  its the normal \\"halloween costume\\" material and isn't going to last forever but arrived quickly and in good shape.  The only issue i had was that when the jacket is buckled closed the buttons don't lineup, so i had to move some buttons to make a straight line.  Otherwise, cute costume!
B0071UVJRK|3|Around 2 months of average use matte finish started coming off in very small areas barely noticeable. But areas got way worse over next couple months. If babied they could last a while.
B002AQ91B6|1|I do not recommend these pants. They used to be great now they are trash. I bought a new pair last week wore them three times and the back side ripped!
B00M6KEZR6|5|This is how we made our announcement at dinner!!! The family absolutely loved it!
B00O7GST10|5|I am very please because they do not leave a line on the forehead.
B00AA0TUBK|3|PICTURE SHOWS SHIRT IS BLACK ON BLACK, WELL, ITS BLACK ON BLUE NOT WHAT I WANTED, BUT IT WILL WORK
B00IVEDVDU|4|I love the shirt's design and the price is fantastic. My only complaint is that as a woman with a 34&#34; bust, and tiny waist I wish it came in an extra small. I ended up ordering a size small and threw it into the dryer after washing it the first time. Still a bit too roomy.
B00A76FF16|1|Despite how great these pants are, they get ruined after just one wash.<br /><br />I first purchased these pants back in February, and I loved them. The fit is great: a fitted pant that is stylish, nice enough to wear to work and stylish enough to wear out on the town. I received quite a few compliments on them, and my roommate was almost going to buy a pair of his own.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after just one wash there were white-ish streaks all over the pants from color fading, front and back. The pants were ruined. I reported this to Amazon, and they were nice enough to send me a new pair.<br /><br />Just washed the new pair for the first time last week. This time, I took special care with washing; washed by themselves, turned inside out, gentle cycle, cold water, etc. AGAIN there are white-ish streaks from color fading. So frustrating and disappointing!<br /><br />A problem with one pair of pants is unlucky, but two pairs having the exact same problem is a design flaw. Unless unsightly white streaks on your khakis is the look you want, I do not recommend these pants.
B00CQ4D2F8|5|Another perfect outfit from Carters. Super soft material and quality is great for a little outfit to hang out in. It's always 70 degrees inside so it's nice to have a short sleeve onesie/pants for playtime and then a light hoodie to throw on for the trip to the car.
B00K7YJF50|5|Love this coat.  It fits perfectly and is stylish and warm!
B0031U0PAG|5|Well made and high quality.
B003VPU8LW|2|These are really large and baggy in the foot area  not that impressed by them at all I ordered a bunch as my little girl is wearing size 5 in clothes and size 10 shoes so she needed all new socks these are too big!
B00ESVN69O|1|Looks nice, but fell apart easily after only a few times of wearing.  Only good if you want to wear it once or twice.  Very poorly assembled at neck area.
B00DE0LIZE|5|cant wait for me, the wife, and baby girl to all rock our lamborghini outfits and have a family photo taken
B000NJDSMA|5|Although the beanie i received did not have a white background behind the plant, the logo was still stitched on very well. Durable. Keeps my head warm and everyone loves it. Have had it for over a year and it still looks good.
B000U8AXOK|3|these shirts are &#34;tagless&#34; problem is they replaced the tag/label with some sort of rubber stamped label/tag that CONSTANTLY is fusing with you neck or back skin. Very annoying. Also material seems skimpier and cheaper than earlier generation of this product which I much preferred. No more for me.
B00HRH764C|5|Great quality i love it i recommend it to every look and dress like a boss ja feel mee !
B00AQW6W7W|5|I ordered the red scarf and thought it was very pretty on.  The colors are true to the photograph and the texture is silky.
B00969UY6G|3|the laptop case is alright.. i expected the materail to be not that cheap.. its seems like it would rip easily.. but great fro all big laptops as well.. very fashionable..
B0014SD0XQ|1|I rarely use cash, the elastic broke and stretched out (no I don't calmly a lot of money) in less than 8weeks
B00I86F0IK|1|If you want what's pictured, do not buy this item.<br /><br />I researched so many swords because I need them for a theatre workshop, for which I am prop mistress. I read so many reviews, and ultimately decided on the one I saw in this picture - because it was the exact thing I'd read about elsewhere, but a dollar or two less.<br /><br />I really and truly wish I'd spent the extra money.<br /><br />Similarities between the picture, and what you're actually going to get - basic shape (loosely) and color (loosely).<br /><br />They're smaller than I'd expected and SUPER flimsy. Of course, I based my expectations on the image above, and what I actually received is NOT pictured above.<br /><br />I expect these will break in the first rehearsal I let the kids use them. And of course I now have no time to order any more, so I'm stuck with these pieces of crap.<br /><br />If I could give anything less than one star, I would.
B00IUFZMLE|5|very stylish baby set
B0058UXK6I|2|Arrived broken. Poor quality. Did arrive quick though. I didn't expect it to be great for the price but it shouldn't have been broken
B00LGCDTE0|5|Poi~fect. I love them :D
B0088WRMYO|5|Love my new Lucky brand jeans. Excellent quality and looks. People can tell that I spent time picking out these jeans because they stand out in a sea of blue.
B005BW27PS|5|We live in Australia and purchased this suit. Even with the postage it still worked out a bargain. The suit quality is great. The fact that you can take up the pants for a custom fit is fantastic.... and there is so much extra leg space for future growth. Sizing is generous. Our son is tall (but skinny) and 5 and a half years old. We got the size 6 and it'll do him til he's 7 years old easily. Shirt and tie match and we are thrilled with the purchase. So cute!
B003YLZDC2|4|Long enough to pull up over the back of your head if needed for both blocking the wind and utilizing the camo.
B002PJ58DS|2|I thought this is the same hat I've been buying for years at Big 5, but it's not.  Darker than it appears in picture, and too thick/heavy to be worn on a hot day.  It is sturdy, and that will appeal to some, but it's too formidable for me to wear comfortably.  Also, the mesh holes appear to be slightly larger than the similar hat I have.  This manufacturer makes many hat models that are too similar to each other.
B00I7H6CUK|5|Beautiful dress. It's even prettier in person.
B0013B2350|5|Cool hat!
B00BPRPZDE|5|Can't wait for it to get colder so I can put my son in this little outfit
B009Z42L68|5|I love this t-shirt.  First of all, it’s in beautiful shades of my favorite color – purple.  It fits true to size and looks great.  It’s very soft but is holding up very well.  My favorite part is that it’s long enough, which I am grateful for, to tuck inside low rise jeans and not have to keep re-tucking it in all the time because this is a huge pet peeve of mine with shirts.  I love the slogan, which prompted me to buy it in the first place, and I get so many comments and even a few thumbs up from the guys.  It’s fun to walk in a store wearing it and see the smiles because you know exactly who the WoW players are!  They understand it and know what it means.  My packages, as always, are packaged very well and arrive on time or earlier than expected, Amazon has not failed me yet!!! I highly, highly, highly recommend this t-shirt.
B00AW47OIA|5|Love this scarf! Very pretty maroon color and turned out just as I'd hoped.
B00A2OAYHI|4|Everything was received and was as expected. I bought this as a gift and they were pleased, and grateful. Thanks Amazon and thanks to all involved in making this a pleasant shopping experience.
B00I44ZLS0|1|Very nice design but poor quality. The design started peeling off after the first wash. Totally unusable after 3 washes. Waste of money.
B00CS5955G|5|This bow was not as big as I wanted it to be. I thought I wanted an oversized minnie mouse like bow. But it turned out to be perfect. I can compare the size to the type of bows the cheerleading girls wear on there hair. About 6&#34; long and about 4&#34; width. I really loved wearing it
B00DF0SHT8|2|Arms were too short and body size too small- I had bought this for our grandson, but had to return it as it did not fit him.  I purchased two 2T sized sleepers instead and they fit just fine.
B003VESX10|5|These pants fit and look like they were tailored for me. The wool is comfortable and the colors fit with most of my sport coats or golf shirts for versatility.
B007RGCXAK|5|my dad loved it!
B004XY0O0K|5|Available in 3 sizes:<br />- 3 to 6 months<br />- 6 to 12 monhs<br />- 12 to 18 months.<br /><br />Please specify he size with your order.<br /><br />For more designs visit [...]
B00OTFCDIE|5|love it, the sleeves don't go all the way down tho
B001CCFNG6|4|Would have gotten a five except we received the costume with two left hands instead of a left and a right. Made things a little difficult on Halloween.
B00BMCECTU|5|FIT: The shirt fits exactly as I expected/hoped. It fits like any other shirt I buy off-the-rack in the same size. I wouldn't call the style of the fit &#34;athletic,&#34; which tends to have tighter arms and a slightly less boxy hang. This shirt doesn't hug the body like an &#34;athletic fit&#34; shirt would, but it's not one of those cheap shirts that feels like you're wearing something a first-grader cut out of fabric and sewed together.I like the way the shirt fits.<br /><br />FABRIC: Besides the design, this is my favorite feature of this shirt. The fabric is great. It feels like a tee you've had for years. Very soft, very comfortable.<br /><br />STYLE: You can more or less see the style in the image. It doesn't differ much from that. One thing I would note is that you can kind of see that the image has a slightly faded look to it, and that is true to the product that arrived at my door. I like that look. It's not too much, but it's designed to look like a stenciled piece that's seen the washer a few times. It does so successfully.<br /><br />Love it.
B00GTCG7G4|5|Quality material...great color
B002NESYDQ|2|The clothing part of the costume isn't too bad. It says do not wash, but I washed it anyway (come on, it's for a toddler!) and it went through the wash and dryer coming out just fine. The lab coat seems more like a simple drape of fabric with sleeves. I will probably sew the collar down to the main part of the coat because the only thing creating it is a crease in the fabric with nothing to hold it in place. The accessories, on the other hand, are awful! The emblem on the bag was peeling off before I even took it out of the packaging, and there is stuffing coming out of the &#34;stethoscope&#34;. I don't feel like these are safe to give to my teething 10 month old (he wears 18/24 mo size clothing).
B00P67R096|1|Sooooo disappointed. Too small and the bottom too heavy and just not flattering at all. I have a number of dresses from same company which are all perfect. Guess there is a first time for everything
B00E0HY4MY|4|Too much glitter - but cuter than cute!
B003PPQYDO|5|Love neff hats. I buy them for my girlfriend and she loves them. They nice and have a little give for a comfy slouch.
B003V4AL06|4|Took a star away because mine doesn't look like the photo.  It's the same belt but it's darker brown on the outside face and similar on the inside.  Otherwise I have no complaints, shipping was fast.<br /><br />I had planed to use with a costume so the look in the picture was what I was really after, I don't think I can use it for that purpose at all.  The under side of my belt looks similar albeit pristine but there is no way to reverse the buckle without restitching it.  It's still a nice belt for the price the photo is of the belt I recieved
B00NQH9H9E|5|This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it!
B00I1FR2SO|4|I bought this for my niece and the quality is very nice. Cool design.<br />Just a little too small.<br />I would order a size up so it won't shrink if you wash it then hang dry.
B00K6ZSSSA|5|I love these sets! I have them all for my twins.
B0079TRA8A|5|Trekked home in the middle of an Alaskan blizzard wearing JUST this parka and stayed totally warm!
B00L1Q2ORO|4|Cut small, but looks very nice on.
B001KBZ2WE|4|fine
B00TX4R3BI|4|If it had fit it would have been perfect for our Las Vegas vow renewal.  The quality was great but she's 100 pounds and a small was to small even for her.  Zipper wouldn't even go all the way up.
B00M0W3HQU|5|the little boy I gave them to loves them, comfortable,
B00EHAGZM6|5|Lovely . A bit large for a 4/5
B003HC8RVW|5|love it
B007R6JPC4|5|This backpack has so many hidden features and is very durable. My only issue would be that the bag does not like to &#34;stand up&#34;. I find that a packed bag tends to fall forward no matter how I pack it. Otherwise, I love it and use it for work everyday.
B00I9KMME0|1|only worn it twice and it is all balled up on the sleeves... :(
B00FWKY9BE|5|I bought this as a gift for my 20 year old step-daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  She wears it to all of her &#34;going to be seen by many people&#34; events.  It looks really great on her.<br /><br />The details are so beautiful, the colors pop, and the little bells jingle when she walks.<br /><br />I was worried that it may be too big for her (she is a size 2).  But, it really does adjust to fit anyone.<br /><br />Love it!
B000KD2X52|5|WE LOVE THESE!  These are small and compact for packing but such a great tool for the camp site.  This is a gotta have for your supply pack.
B00CHOQEOI|5|very cute item
B00IU1T1OW|4|good fit, durable material, very satisfied
B00KRA4MIO|5|This little out fit is just adorable.
B0084ARZLK|4|If you're going by the manufacturers sizing - it runs REALLY big. Buy at least 1 (if not 2) sizes smaller. But it's a nice coat. Good quality. Love the fact that it has a zip out lining, doubling as a spring/fall jacket.
B00QLH2UV8|4|This swimsuit is exactly as I expected - the color and fit were perfect. The sizing is tricky - you must go by the size chart that is provided and use the size according to your measurements. I normally wear a large, but I went by the size chart and ordered the XXXL. It fit perfectly so thank goodness I went by the size chart and not by what size I normally order.
B00DU6A9SY|4|This shirt is nice but isn't very dressy. Would look better with a pair of jeans.
B00CMSSZGE|4|This shirt fits great and the material is also nice. I am 5'2''  and 120 and it looks very nice.
B00NXMK6IS|5|Perfect!! I LOVE this shirt
B00YKQ9JB6|2|Letters begin to peel after first wash
B00VKRLA1U|1|The waist rolls up constantly, creating an ugly bulge at the top, and the pants are see-through below. Also there was a run in them by the second wear.
B005WT1ALC|4|The dress makes a good night gown or each cover up.  It is sauna.  The colors are good and the length is longer then most.
B001CCJHBS|4|Nice jacket for the price. Goes well with my hoodies. It doesn't look cheap at all. Will recommend this ja ket for any working middle class gentlemen.
B003ZK6RTA|5|best wallet i have ever owned its very well built i think it will last for years and years all of the wallets i buy they start coming apart after the 1st or 2nd year i never knew what a well built wallet was unitl i bought this wallet i was worried about spending that much for a wallet but i guess i learned you get what you pay for and this is worth every bit i paid for it
B001AUDUA6|5|I just received the wig and I love it! The quality is great and the color is fantastic and perfect for what I needed it for!
B000ONJ3WY|5|This hat was exactly what my father has been looking for! I am so excited to give it to him for christmas!
B0042R6L82|3|Was waaay too big for my toddler.
B00KYHC0FM|1|The chinese measurement does not match with USA size and measurement,totaly waste of money.....big mistake, never gonna order to china......
B000IF3VE4|5|Great quality thick cotton, doesn't fade or shrink much and the colors are vivid.  great shirt and I like frogs!
B00P0DQ5WE|5|Just received my corset and noticed first, great quality. It's rubber so it's much more sturdy than others I've ordered that's cloth and also harder to put on, not a bad thing. The spines are flexible which means they bend back in place not bend out of shape.  It's long which helps cover the bottom tummy pouch. Being 5'2 doesn't matter so don't let the word 'long' in the description deter you. From the first hook, I could tell it was going to make a huge difference. It's feels extremely comfortable and when you move, it moves. I'm 5'2, 192 lbs.  I ordered a 3XL and it was PERFECT. My clothes size is XL and XXL so I looked at lots of reviews to help decide best size for me. I would go up 2 sizes from your normal clothing size. Mine hooks into the first set of hooks and you want to have a bit of a struggle to get it on to get maximum effect and use for your money. I will re-evaluate in a couple of weeks on the sturdiness to ensure it doesn't lose it's elasticity and shape.
B00856YHD2|5|I normally hate wearing stockings but they are sooo comfortable and soft. I've never had a better pair!! I'm actually going to purchase a few more in case I get a hole or something.
B004CO8DZY|5|Perfect!
B006B5Z616|1|The pants size are smaller than advertised.  The quality was below what I expected, so I returned it to Amazon.  I need to go to a store and try on the pants before buying them.
B007M7FSVK|5|Easy to put on and keep my toddler dry while he walks through rainy Seattle and splashes in every puddle he can find.
B00026YSKU|2|These were my first pair of briefs. I have worn boxers for well over 10 years. I figured briefs would be more supportive and comfortable. In terms of support, sure it is a positive over boxers, but at the expense of comfort. When I run out of boxers, I DREAD the idea of having to wear these all day, to work, sleep, or even watch TV. The fabric itself is a very, very comfortable material. The issue is that is rides up the legs, if I push it down, and do anything other than stand there, with no movement, they go right up. It literally will ride up your legs ALL day no matter how little of physical activity you are doing.<br /><br />I understand these aren't compression shorts/underwear, but I was expecting better considering compression shorts stay in place much better during a lot of physical movement at the gym. I liked the tighter feeling, and that is what wanted me to try briefs, for all day comfort; but Jockey's fail at that, miserably.<br /><br />I am hesitant to try another boxer brief because these have been a total disaster. One star is for the look, they look very nice, and the other is for the great comfort of material. The other three absent stars are for its discomfort while wearing.<br /><br />For better or worse, hopefully this has helped someone.
B00CPKFR6U|5|This scarf every time I wear it I'm always asked where did you get that scarf, and it goes with so many different outfits😘
B00BKWTOZO|4|Perfect fit, but back pockets too low.
B0027NMSL2|5|Great shirt! :)
B00NBWUSSI|4|Color ran when washed
B005OTG916|5|I love it
B00K3W77II|5|perfect
B00DW4NC42|5|Like it
B004PSVV3I|5|The picture hasn't peeled or cracked, and I've owned it for a year. It went through the laundry without a problem all year.
B00CE91HDE|4|This is a nice, quality sweatshirt. My only complaint is if you don't want the mask over your eyes, you can't use the hood. The mask part doesn't stretch the width of the hood, making it impossible to put the hood on. Otherwise, my daughter loved it.
B0002U2YAC|5|I use this bag for all of my school stuff and I can honestly say that the bag is huge and it can expand to an even bigger size. The bag is very well constructed and it deals very well with any abuse that mother nature can throw at it, I have taken this bag through rain, snow, sleet, heat, below freezing weather and it still looks brand new. Plus it looks cool and  is not too metro.
B0086UA7WW|5|GREAT TOP AND LOVE THE STYLE, I WILL ORDER MORE TOPS FROM PATTY'S BOUTIQUE...KEEP ON MAKING BEAUTIFUL TOPS AND I WILL GIVE YOU MORE BUSINESS.....
B007NGB95E|4|I got these socks for my 10 year old daughter to wear with her sneakers during PE at school.  She really likes them, but has just one gripe:  &#34;They make my feet sweaty&#34;.
B00OMWJHRO|5|The design, fabric and fit are perfect! Thank you Seller. I would buy this again in other colors.
B00JMF389Y|5|Very nice veil. I like the ribbon detail. I wore this for my wedding. It comes with the comb attached. I bobby pinned it in my hair to hold it in better.
B00CV39POG|5|I have one in a different color and I love it .bought it in a store and paid a lot more! Makes a great over shirt/lite jacket for cool evenings,would like one in blue, but have to draw the line somewhere.
B0038Y6SRY|5|Really works.  Wash and they are dry in the AM.
B009CTUIF2|5|I love how the pockets are nice and big so there's no worry of anything falling out. Plus the smaller pocket within the pocket is usefull from keeping my keys from scratching my phone
B002G9U8A0|5|This jacket is my go-to as soon as fall hits.  I wear it from October through Spring.  It keeps me toasty in very cool weather, but at times I wish it were a bit larger so I could wear another layer under it.  It truly is a workhorse - I've had it now for a few years and it looks brand new.  When it gets dirty, I throw it in the washer and it looks like new.  This is definitely the absolute best bet for your buck.
B00BXT577I|5|Most probably use these as a fashion statement or to look Tacti-Cool. I wear mine when working outside to keep the sun off of me. After having some skin cancer removed, I tend to be much more careful to keep the sun off when I'm working outside for long periods. Works great for mowing the lawn. Keeps the sun off, filters out some of the dirt and dust, and soaks up the sweat that would otherwise run into my eyes.<br /><br />Was kind of stinky and itchy at first, but a run through the washer and dryer solved that problem. Handy little trinket.
B00LQEK4AU|5|Bought it several months ago and still looks new after many washings.Toasty warm and soft. Normally take a 14-16...bought the plus size for extra comfort. Buy a size larger if you like your PJ loose.
B009EOPNAA|2|there's a line in the pattern that does not match. I thought that it was common sense to match the lines for stripes. I am pretty DISAPPOINTED~
B00NPAHAVY|5|Just as pictured. I love this coat!!
B000I2KWTO|1|I would not recommend this costume. It is way over priced and online it looks adorable, in person it is very cheap looking. Plus you only have 72 hours to return it and now I am stuck with a costume that is WAY to big for my 4 month old daughter.
B00IQITBM6|5|She loves it ,shipped as expected .
B00K8F3XJC|2|Pretty dress but not quite what I was expecting from the product photo. The dress fits fine but is much shorter than \\"tea length\\". Hits right above the knee. Not nearly as full as pictured and, in person, the sheer part of the top just made the dress a little too \\"grown up\\" for my 5 year old.
B00NL6UWTO|4|I usually wear small, sometimes medium, according to the size chart ordered this in XL.<br />It took almost a month for me to get it.<br />Not bad for the price, though the fit is somewhat tight, I could not add a sweater under it.
B002C5EU0W|3|Runs small
B00HPZLVMO|1|the clingy material is not flattering to bigger women
B00SF84LG8|5|Dress fits great! Even prettier in person.  Elegant look for a great price! Very pleased with this purchase
B00E8DBBEY|5|Works well.
B00L6W80QW|5|My co-workers went absolutely nuts over this wig when I wore it with Vulcan ears for Halloween. I liked it too. Now I'm thinking of doing the two tone thing for myself.
B00PXWMDLE|5|Love, love, love this shirt, new favorite. I am curvy and it hid the curves I wanted hidden. Fits well and is flattering. It is a bit sheer, so wear a cami or something underneath.
B00KK3TJAE|5|I wear small,  I ordered a XL fit as expected ,nice blouse. Love it !!
B00DDM8C20|5|Love it
B00KT1LMZC|3|These would be great if they were sewn like the other David Archy styles with an indent for the package.  These feel too tight.  The fabric also feels more like a nylon than a bamboo.
B00DUUN5JU|5|The material is nice.  They are soft and comfy. Good weight. Kids liked the color, the zippers are well made and easy.
B0057I6676|1|Cheap looking shirt! My son wears it to bed and that's it. I would not recommend buying this cheap shirt.It looks like a bunch of stickers on a t-shirt.
B00BU11Q38|4|the style is very nice the colors are a little muted, the red is more maroon compared to the picture but I like the colors. The cotton is a little thinner than expected but I'll let you know after I wash it.
B008RKE3JE|4|Cute outfit. OK quality. I would suggest to go up a size for a chubbier child. The one I got for my daycare boy was a little snug.
B0009MZV94|5|Super for my upcoming GC hike!  Comfortable, thick but not bulky.My feet did not get too sweaty.Look forward to another pari.
B0000ZFHI0|3|I've used similar thigh highs before that were the same size, but fit better. I used the size chart, but these were just way too difficult to unroll. The quality was good, but not sure I'll get a lot of use out of them because of the size issue.
B00A74I17S|2|Not the same as you can buy in a department store.  They are made of stretchy, thin fabric that hug your body like a glove (good I guess if you're looking for skinny jeans).  The 514s I buy from Belk are made of thick denim and fit your body a little looser. I already took the tags off and wore this pair once so I'm not sure if I can return them at this point.
B00H5MTT0I|5|I love this dress!  It's well constructed and the material flows well without being clingy.  The wide fabric at the shoulders and the back cofiguration is very light and and airy but doesn't show your bra straps.  I am 5' 10&#34; and this hits me just above the ankles.
B002PDPEEW|3|The padding is very stiff but for the price, it's apretty good bra. They have a lot of great colors too.
B00DB3EKM2|4|Fits well, cool style but is definitely more of an inside jacket and not an outer layer.
B004X6515G|5|Soft and matches in color. It is slightly thin but long enough to doule wrap
B005CSOFIS|4|I ordered XL size for this hoodie, because of previous reviews. But probably I was wrong. It is a little bit bigger, than I expected. No question about quality and color.
B008YQYITG|1|You are only buying the jacket and not the suit. I recently made that mistake thinking I was getting a suit Because the product description had said \\"Doublju Mens luxury one button Dress SUIT...and they only send me the jacket. I think the reworded the product description now to fix the issue. As far as the jacket in my opinion is not worth the money. The material is stiff and again if you have any build to your body it will probably fit very snug as it did on me.
B002XZMCR4|2|I like to quality of the fabric but the description of low rise is under estimated. I am pretty evenly proportioned and bought the same size i buy in my other leggings they were not transparent but the rise was so low that the waist band in the back did not cover everything that should be covered...think plumber.
B006UJD7EQ|5|Great!
B00IP8G8AU|5|This was a fantastic costume, I got tons of compliments and I was so glad I didn't pay more for a &#34;higher quality&#34; dress, this one did the trick! I paired it with cuban heel hose, some long gloves, and a headband like the one in the picture. I looked at 1920's make up tutorials and did an emerald green eye shadow. I win Halloween!
B004SUGRI2|4|I bought the wrong size. ㅠ ㅠ<br />However, the color is the same as shown in the monitor.<br />22 months until the son, keep well though.<br />Not only incorruptible said.<br />Oh! This should not be verified by the tracking number, but the delivery is good it was a little ahswiwot.
B0009MZWFW|4|After 2 washings the tops do not stay up as well as I would prefer. I would recommend them to others.
B00MQ1BEQU|5|Love it
B00SG8DULO|5|I love this dress and wear it often. It's comfortable and I love how it looks.
B00KIJOLCQ|2|It's a very pretty shirt, but I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with how it fit me. I purposely ordered it in a larger size because I figured when I washed and dried it that it would shrink up somewhat. But when I tried the shirt on it was extremely snug on me and didn't look good. I ended up just giving my Mom the shirt.
B005XI5MXY|5|I've been using this bra for work for several years now. They are comfortable and a perfect fit
B00BV9002C|5|The Grand daughter and her friends had a great time with this piñata. Was very bright and easy to use.
B007C5M5MM|5|Awesome looking SOA long sleeve shirt.  Washes well and so far has held up to wearing quite well.  Second shirt I've bought through this store and first shirt is doing as well after a year.
B00Q2PTEO0|4|I liked it even my daughter like it.. It's small than I expected ..
B00QNW1A8K|5|excelente producto
B007FYYSLQ|3|This hat has great coverage, but the adjustable cord is difficult to get right.  Because it has a wide brim, it catches the wind and is apt to fly off my head.  If the cord is tight enough to keep the hat in place, it leaves marks around my forehead.  Because I wear this on my commute or when I go out for lunch (versus hiking, where I wouldn't really care about my appearance), its not ideal.  I'm still trying to figure out the right amount of tension.
B001MKBSD0|4|I ordered this for my son's communion. It is a nice suit. The jacket was a little big to where the vest was slightly small but fit well other wise .
B00UPNCT9W|4|With every cent
B002G9UEHC|5|This had was not only fashionable, but very warm.<br />It was bought along with the Carhartt's Men's Therma;<br />Lined Duck Active Jacket. Worth the Money.
B005K2N3K2|4|Small = 28-30  , this is the size of them.
B00564B0UY|5|Got it in the mail the exact day they said it would come, it was perfect! It's meant for older ones, really not little kids, but it's still really cute! I love how durable it feels, and how warm it really is(= Perfect for a winter trip to New Mexico!
B00CMQ9ITE|4|I wear it every day
B008NB46NU|5|Nice shirt, people keep walking up to me squinting at the pattern to see what it is. Well made item.
B00MEB71C8|4|very pretty but too tight in my hips and belly
B006SVWGTI|1|I ordered the blue cake headband for my twin boys and instead received two pairs of pink booties so I was very disappointed.
B003IBECB6|5|Excellent quality, well made.super cute and seems comfortable
B00LWHANT8|5|It was perfect,  just like the ones I wore for years.
B0046MFRC4|3|I recently purchased some similar shorts from Croft and Barrows, same size and they fit. These are tight and have no give. So I gave them away. I hope the latest recipient is happier.
B00L2FIB08|5|Absolutely love these shoes!
B00BMJ00I0|5|Love this roomy wallet. Has many pockets and card slots as well as a roomy change section. stunning color. The snap to close the wallet is VERY TIGHT so hard to pull open.
B0076R6NSI|5|very good!!
B00EZAV8PW|4|Totally got my money's worth
B0058D2GBU|5|Excellent quality! Shipped quickly and well packed. Should last for years to come. Highly recommended.
B00FW8951A|5|Wife bought this item for a base layer to keep warm. they work well and not as costly as some other big name brands. will buy again.
B00NGH44UQ|5|I purchased this for my son's prom.  The jacket arrived much quicker than expected and, though we were worried it would be too small (or possibly too big,) it fit perfectly. He is 5'11&#34; and is very slim (he weighs 120 pounds.)  We ordered the 3XL/US med based on the measurements.  No one at prom had a jacket like it and he won best dressed.  :-)  He's not sure how he's going to top that jacket next year........
B00D4IY8OE|4|granddaughter loves it.
B001UHMYSS|5|Wish I can buy a few more pairs for my winter trip to asia.
B00FMQZUZC|3|Only came up to my knees, I'm 5&#34;0
B00J63U4J4|3|larger than expected
B0065W1MTU|4|I loved this suit in the picture, then I recieved it in the mail.  It was extremely small!! My daughter is very petite, she is one 15# at one year.  This suit at the 12 month size looks like a 3-6 month suit.  I am sending it back because it doesn't fit.
B003DPP090|4|While this hat is not the most structural sound or 'perfect' fit, I still consider this a good buy.  Others have mentioned the fact that the beads seem a little off center which I also found, but for a beach hat that is going to get banged up, it served its purpose.
B00B46JJ1U|5|These are beautiful gloves!!!!!! Love these so much I am buying more for me and giving some as gifts! Amazing quality. Never guess they are so inexpensive. They took a bit to arrive, but worth the wait! They even came with a nice note!  I get compliments every time I wear them.
B00M4D65LO|5|This robe is everything I was looking for.  It is very thin but I was looking for lightweight for the warm/hot weather. Looks just like it does on line, same color and length.  It came sooner than I expected so I was very pleased with the shipping and handling. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a lightweight robe.
B000VLVPHA|4|Pros: This is not your typical lightweight, flimsy Halloween cape, but is well constructed and made from durable materials.  Only complaint was the collar does not stay up very well and you'll want to remove the tags because they tend to show.
B007FZHGIC|2|Drawstring on pants...was too costume like for what I wanted
B00KXHNOYE|4|great material. The baby wears them to sleep under her pajamas during the winer
B005Y16YDM|5|beautiful, high quality outfit. I purchased the 3m size but it fit my 8lb newborn pretty well.
B00P000UCS|5|Products great, and it didn't take long to get.  Exactly what I was anticipating and for a great price.  Usually you have to buy them individually from a hippie mom on etsy for $15 each.  Now...if I could only get my daughter to keep it on her head.
B00ISQ35IW|5|Great shirt, and very comfortable fit
B006L6SVMQ|1|I have no idea how this item looks. I purchased it on December 5th with a bunch of other items. I received the other items but still have NOT received this particular item. I tried tracking the order but NO tracking info. The order amount has already been taken out of my account so I guess I'm out that money. Not cool at all!!!!!!  So I finally received the gloves around the 2oth even though it said they would be delivered by the 14th. I didn't look at the tag before wrapping them. The person I gave them too couldn't even wear them they were so tight. She finally figured it out by looking at the tag which clearly said YOUTH on them. Do NOT buy these unless you are getting them for a YOUTH! They won't fit.   Thankfully, I have been created the full amount and plan on purchasing a different gift. It's just unfortunate that they didn't get to receive a gift for the holidays.
B00CNV5EIW|3|This bathing suit is smaller than I would have liked.  If you are smaller chested and want your twins lifted up, then this is a good bathing suit for you, but if you already have a nice size pair and don't need to perk them up, then beware.
B006PF0VOY|2|Beautiful piece. Arrived far too loose fitting. Very sad, returning item.
B004GGUA1I|5|Love the graphics on it and the colors are vibrant. Fits well and the material is smooth to the skin. I've ordered some other Godzilla shirts from Amazon. Some are cheaper and some are sold through Amazon Prime.
B00ACIFXJ8|5|The quality of the cotton is superior, very recommended.
B00IYJQHU6|5|Love this sash! I wore it with my wedding gown and it really made my dress pop! Great sash with a great price! Two thumbs up!
B00JUM31F0|4|Comfortable hoodie at a good price.
B00C6F6ODY|4|I tried these pant because they has a longer inseam length and I liked the pocket. I have straight leg jeans in other brands and thought this would be a good all-around pant/jean. For my taste, the legs are too large. The legs were very loose on me while the fit through the hips and waist was okay. I will look for NYDJ skinny rather than straight-leg in the future. There is nothing wrong with these pants, they are very nice. My personal preference is for a more tapered or fitted leg jean.
B00TEC2WNI|5|I love these capris!
B00NHQ24RQ|5|Great looking shirt, fit perfectly.
B00DT70DK8|3|Love the design, but it was small for an extra large
B00KHKMTPW|2|They are ok.  Not staying together well and hard to adjust.
B00JHZSWDQ|5|First bathing suit since I had my daughter 8 years ago that I feel comfortable & still stylish in!
B00CQ9ENVA|2|These socks are perfect if you are wearing a low cut shoe. It will appear as though you do not have socks on. Great for summer. The biggest problem with these socks is that after wearing them for one day they developed a hole because they are Very thin. If you can afford wearing a sock one time, they are good for what they are intended to do. No show sock - but will not last long.
B0009GB88S|5|Great shirt...
B00U2E7WF0|5|These are wonderful!  I love them!  They are just as expected.  I haven't washed them yet but you can tell that they will be really soft once they are washed.  I had been looking everywhere for a set of pajamas with shorts and short sleeved shirt that was a &#34;boyfriend&#34; style pajamas.  I am a size 14-16 in misses or a 14W in women's and the XL fits me perfect!
B00A7QUBAG|5|Nice tees that fit will and don't shrink.
B00DG7ES4I|5|Fit exactly as described, I ordered a size smaller than normal.The fabric is light weight and feels soft,cool and comfortable.
B0035YH5YC|5|Got this for my mother in law for her birthday.  I was concerned about the quality because I shipped it directly to her but my mother in law loves it.
B0001FF80G|5|Lots of room for things and well made.  I can put everything I need in it.  Good zipper and lining and the top stays open when you need it to.
B00FHT7QSS|5|It's my 3 rd one have the same in black, rust and now this color! It's soooo soft and cozy I love it!! Can't wait Til cream color is available!!!
B00Y43QT1S|3|The dress is beautiful BUT runs VERY small. The XXL is closer to a M.
B000YXGNKY|5|Awesome these are such a hard thing to come by in a normal retail setting. My Husband just loves these.
B00INTZ99W|3|Good Quality
B00DSYEHSQ|1|What ever it had ordered it didn't came like that. Totally upset with the product. Size was not fit. It was valentines gift to my husband but all in vein. Returning back.
B00ENLQ704|5|Beautiful hat full of American truth
B00DQNASPU|2|The center seam gives a weird shape under clothes.
B001F6S3L6|5|Excellent purchase. I bought it for my daughter's homecoming date to match her dress...It matched perfectly and everyone loved his tie. Customer service was excellent when I phoned to get the correct color of pink! I will always buy my ties from this seller! They rock!!
B0085B4H9Q|5|Great quality product, soft fabric, cute design! Was delivered in two days! Quickly shipped and awesome company!
B00OIROLQA|5|Received a lot of compliments- great fit
B0043WIYWC|5|So 'cute'  I love it!  Bought it for a cruise, going to elegant night as a flapper!  Can't wait to wear it and have pics made!
B00OTG9B92|1|Too small for usa size
B00IBD8CJO|5|I love it
B00DZYRNV2|3|As advertised
B00SV0SM88|5|The shirt is perfect and so is the fit
B00W1F7N1G|5|VERY BEAUTUFUL.
B00GO0GEQO|1|Poorly sewn and constructed.
B00JKE6LDM|5|This outfit is absolutely adorable! We get compliments on it every time she wears it! I wish it was made of cotton but the material is soft and is holding up well.
B00C6L117C|3|Had purchased a pair of jeans several years back that had quality fabric.  I was disappointed in the quality of the fabric in this pair so I returned them.
B00JZBLTCS|5|Love the graphics with this one.
B008B476Z4|4|These jeans were for my husband. They looked good on him, and the fit was not super-slim. However, choosing between these and another pair of slim jeans, he picked the one with the more uniform color. Fading on the thighs always makes them look wider.
B00CHQ4G0K|4|Loved the color, loved the feel - just too darn big! I got the L/XL -  I'm 5'9&#34;, gave birth to twins, & it STILL wrapped around to almost front again!  I went with the next size down, S/M, which is still pretty voluminous, but I loved the color & feel, not to mention the length, so much, I'm keeping it!  The sleeves fit perfectly, & there's a belt on these things for a reason!  ; )
B000A3NR20|5|This is a beautiful gown!  It's really sexy and my mate was estactic when he saw me in it!  You dont need a \\"perfect\\" figure to wear this.  It's soft, extremely sexy, it flows beautifully, and all that you can imagine in a sexy, sexy, piece of lingerie. The bodice has elastic stitching to support the breasts.  The thong is trimmed in lace. I absolutely love it!!! Its really comfortable. It makes me feel extremely feminine. BUY as many as you can!!!  I know I am!
B001LV8B62|5|I have been looking for something more form fitting that wasn't a Speedo©.. cuz I dont roll like that.. haha.. but these are just sexy enough without being too over the top (depending on your definition I suppose). They are like shorts.. made of a swimsuit material, a bit more of an athletic cut... very comfortable. Holds.. everything.. in place.. and they look great. I will say that I was expecting a different kind of material,  but it is swim wear after-all.  Since  I have been busting my ass to get in an even better shape before the next big birthday, looking good in these have been a nice reward. The lady in my life thought they would be a bit too revealing, but that is now her favorite feature :)Not a bad price either.
B00ORZIYBQ|5|Absolutely the best &#34;wallet&#34; I've ever owned.  I don't like rear pocket wallets, though, so I am biased. This holds all my cards and you can fold up a little cash and stick it in there too, if you want.  I've never tested its water resistance, and I can't imagine why it would matter anyhow since all I keep in here is plastic.
B00BPW08B8|5|This dress was beautiful and fit perfectly. We are very pleased with this purchase. Our daughter received several compliments when she wore it.
B000J3GDF4|1|The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back.
B00LV5ES8S|5|Gogeous!
B012FH49NY|1|This art is stolen, please do not buy, see www.facebook.com/noflutter.
B00GV8GJR8|5|It fit nice on my daughter, and got here in time for my friends wedding, the comment where amazing about how cute she looked!
B00DYB2AGO|5|This is a wonderful company! Not only are their products loud and deliver a message, but they are also affordable, great quality and made from sturdy materials. I was pleasantly surprised with how fast this shipped! Arriving 2 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. A great surprise! Also, I emailed the company regarding a inquiry I had and they replied immediately as well as were very attentive and compassionate. A personal feel you don't often get when conducting online interactions these days. Fan-girl for life here!
B00EOIDU24|5|We got a chubby baby with some thick legs, so we buy bigger sizes, especially for pants. This outfit has just the right amount of stretch; not something I could say about other items I bought in the past.
B00FT72XZE|3|Got an extra small instead of small cause they &#34;run large&#34;. Top fit perfect but the pants only made it halfway up my thighs. Makes me wonder if I really should start hitting the gym or if the sizes are messed up cause regardless of brand I'm always a small except for unisex. It's a hit or miss which sucks cause it shouldn't be. Good luck
B00DLK1MV2|4|Love the dress, too large for me 5'5 125lb but figure I can have it altered or shrink it.
B00J0AYY9E|4|Robe was somewhat large. Robe is nice and heavy. I weight 170lbs 5'9&#34; will enjoy this robe.
B00GKC1TEI|3|Dress is beautiful.  top is too small and bottom of dress is to large.  should fit any shape but it doesnt
B00A8VZLQ4|1|Do NOT buy this dress. It's cheaply made and is not worth even five bucks. I was super disappointed and refuse to buy from Allegra K again. All of their products are cheaply made. Not even as good as a Halloween costume
B009J2VHAM|4|From reading the reviews, I expected a bad costume.  Instead I got a nice costume that fit well.  Definitely not a high end jacket/outfit, but for the price it is cute and will work nicely at my event.
B000UCR5N8|5|I let my daughter pick out the cute underwear to get excited about potty training but I can't tell you how often I was cleaning the run or a floor out in public.  It took me about a month or two to find these and I LOVE them!!! They are awesome! They don't hold it all in of course and I do carry extra shorts/pants since they get wet buuuut it doesn't always go down her legs and onto the floor. I highly reccomend these!!! I just wish they were a bit cheaper but I still would pay the price!
B008BRM2FA|5|This is a very cute dress. Stylish but casual. The size does run small but luckily that was mentioned in the reviews. I normally wear a large or an extra large (size 12 to 14) so I ordered this in XXlarge and figured I would have alterations done if needed. It actually fits pretty good. I dont think any alterations will be necessary. I do wish it was about 2 or 3 inches longer though as it is a little too short for me, but I am 5'10 so im sure most women wont have a problem with the length.
B009PHDOCK|4|Grandson loves Bacon so he should like this one.
B0091K5B0Y|3|ho
B0009MZUWC|2|The socks are well made and provide great cushioning, but contain a heavy seam that runs across the top and over the toes. I use the socks on three runs and experienced irritation and bleeding on all three runs. Suggest they get rid of these seams.
B005GPPHAC|2|This skirt fit just fine.  When I opened the package, and shook out the skirt it was pretty classy.  However, I usually wash everything I buy because I am uncomfortable wearing something new until it is washed.  I followed the washing instructions, cold water etc, and when it was time to dry it, the instructions said to wad it up like a rope.  I did this and when I pulled the skirt out of the dryer all the broom pleats were gone!<br />It was rather expensive and I am returning it.  It looks horrible without the broom pleats.  I thought the pleats were sewn in.  Guess not.
B00NAG69YW|4|I read the reviews before I bought mine so I automatically sized up to a large, but I usually wear a medium or small jacket and I'm 5'1&#34;.
B00LXVWIAK|5|Beautiful colors & designs
B007JAJZ50|3|I ordered the Nautica coat in size xl which is 14/16. What I got was size 18/20!! The coat is too big on my 10 yr old son. I'm frustrated and upset.
B00O8YMMOG|5|WONDERFUL
B0043LYBUC|2|I ordered the shirt 2 sizes larger than I normally wear and it's still way too small.  If you are selling clothing, give true sizes.  It's not that hard
B003TV24JM|5|Bought this for my daughter. She is getting her first key and loves horses so I surprised her with it. She absolutely loves it. It is heavy so she should be able to keep track of it.
B00HLDNW36|2|Not very comfy
B00G9X95TE|3|Material very thin. Disappointed.
B001A15K6C|5|These look and feel great. Size is perfect for my husband, May get some<br />for myself for summer sleepwear. Very soft and well made.
B0018OT8EG|1|I recently purchased two pairs of 560's.  It was immediately evident that Levi's rigorous quality standards had been dropped.  Sure, the fabric and fit were fine, but one pair lacked multiple belt loops and the other pair lacked a front pocket liner.  2 of 2 garments were defective!  Sheez, did quality really cost so much that production of an American staple needed to be outsourced?  Products returned for refunds.
B003LUBV68|2|This would be a great t-shirt if it said what the item name says. Instead of the desired \\"I've had it up to here with midgets\\" the actual shirt says \\"I had it up to here with midgets\\". Quite a grammatical difference, which rather mars the humor.
B002QVWWIO|5|I am writing this reveiw after full and extreme use of these chaps. I have used them for just about everything. The big one is using my chainsaw with a new carbide chain, I lost my balance and the bar hit my leg. The chaps got hooked and the chain stopped with no injurt to my leg. These are nowhere near what real logging leggings are, but I am glad I had them on.
B00MOP23TK|5|beautiful
B00G1T6E1I|5|such shirt. much amaze. very quality. wow. what cotton. wow. so much wear. very compliments. wow. much love doge. wow.
B00B2G1334|3|it did not fit 100%
B00D402M7W|5|Love the coverage for my baby! And we get compliments everywhere we go! Super easy to get on and off as well.
B004VSAFNE|5|I used these all the time but now i cant find them lol cause my 2 year old had lost them. But they are really good and definetely worth the money.
B0007QMKD2|3|I wish I would of ordered a medium it will severe its purpose for the time tho! I like it
B00JDUEIQK|5|very cute
B00C5R7WAW|4|great shirt.. Washes very well and is very nice to the touch. Was a bit larger than expected though.
B0085BAAEC|4|great products but it runs big. buy one size down, esp for Asian ... value for money and it will last longer than its cost
B0056C1H2W|5|exactly what I was hoping for. these were a gift for my dad and he loved them. fit him great, good quality, over all a good choice
B007HON8G0|4|I ORDERED THE SKIRT A LITTLE TO LARGE JUST AROUND THE WAIST. BUT I CAN TAKE IT IN BECAUSE I LIKE THE WAY IT FITS OVER THE HIP AREA.
B004049ZRQ|4|Quality, pre-shrunk fabric, well made shirt!  My daughter LOVES Deal or No deal!!!
B004VIH49W|5|My son loves this tie! He's 13 and has worn it for 2 years now.
B007SOTRNC|1|This is hands down the worst dress I have ever gotten I was beyond excited to get this and was so very disappointed it is completely see through  and is NOT the cut in the photo it has elastic on the neck area I have never seen that an a off the shoulder dress I am sending it back for a refund.
B00JLUG1NU|5|Pricey, but worth it.  These are fantastic.  And they look amazing next to my baby.  That's worth a few bucks alone.<br /><br />I bought lots of cheap stuff when baby came.  Cheap bibs, cheap burping cloths, etc.  It's a piece of cloth, right? No need to spend?  Wrong.  Get good stuff, now, and make your life easier and more pleasant for years.  I am sending my cheap stuff to goodwill soon.  Couple these with these bibs for a divine experience:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K9OS2LG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_67
B006RHWOUO|5|I love love LOVE this swimsuit!! It is slenderizing... With just enough sexy while its on. I'm currently losing weight, and wanted a suit that might still fit when I reach my goal, this suit has enough sucking power that it should still hug my curves when I'm done battling the bulge. Highly recommend!!
B00NPWUGJK|5|I wanted a large sweater that I could wear with leggings, and that's what I got! I got it in the mail today, which was, by the way, over TWO WEEKS before the earliest expected delivery date!<br /><br />I am so thrilled with my purchase. This sweater is extremely soft, and warm! Ugh. I put it on as soon as it got here, and didn't want to take it off XD I've already gotten numerous compliments on it too, because I shared a photo of it.<br /><br />Great buy! I love Home Alone, and I love this sweater!
B00MMMS1YQ|4|Really nice gift for younger girls; my cousins loved them!they are comfortable and warm.
B00A65Z9FA|5|Love love love this shirt! Fits great. So cute. Buttons give it extra flair. Had to buy it in multiple colors.
B0018OSF6I|2|I do not know what happened to levis. I feel their sizes are all over the place.  These were way too tight.  I am aware that they are slim and i did order a size larger.  I would have had to order 2 sizes larger for them to fit.  I was not happy with anything about the jeans.
B007WADUVC|5|I got more compliments on this shirt when I wore it the other day.  It is very comfortable and I<br />love it!
B00816O40C|5|I bought these for my 3 y/o.  She wears a size 8 in boy shorts 10 in briefs.  these panties are very cute, fit good, and provide adequate coverage for a little girl.  I choose these because they offer more coverage than regualr panties my duagher is bottom heavy.  they are descibed as seller mentioned and arrived on time.  I would purchase from this seller again.
B00LMYDFSW|5|I usually wear a size 16w, but purchased this in 18w because of the cut.  This dress looks amazing!  Amazon didn't have my size, so I purchased locally, and I'm so glad I did.  Don't miss your opportunity to own this flattering dress that can be worn from the office to a night out on the town.
B009GRVMI2|1|Very poor quality
B007DBGUS0|5|I wear scrunchies often.  These I bought for a different reason.  I have a holiday sweater that has sleeves way too long .I used these to hold them up.  They worked great.  The material is a good quality.  I wear them for my ponytail too.
B0073167RY|5|I was hesitant to purchase this dress as one person said it was low quality and others said that it was low cut and did not fit well.  I guess I'm just an odd shape b/c I ordered the size I typically wear (refer to size chart they provide, NOT amazon's size chart if you have questions) and it fits me like a glove.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 135lbs and the size 8 fits perfect.  It's just the right length for me.  I can see where it would be long for people who are shorter.  Yes, the chest area is tight. Probably not good for those who are &#34;blessed&#34;.  I'm a B-C cup so this was perfect for me. There is no give to the dress so check the measurements before guessing.  The fabric is wonderful, good quality and I ordered the white which was not see through at all.  There is enough fabric in the chest where I won't be needing a bra.  You could wear one with it, the only place you could see the bra was around the armpit area, which is cut low.<br />LOVE this dress and can't wait to wear it to a beach wedding I'll be attending in Hawaii.
B002ZKO65I|5|I recieved a different set of Trumpette socks as a gift and they fit so well that i ordered these. My son is 3 months old and they fit great. He gets lots of compliments too.
B00C91BHA0|5|I took a chance in getting something too large or too small,but instead the robe fit the person just right.
B00J2GWJZM|4|just fit as expected. Great!
B00IYIIOGC|5|The color,pattern,fabric ..all vey nice
B004RKLV48|4|I bought this for my husband and he says the shirt is very comfortable.
B00O1AGB1C|4|My son is a huge Ghosbusters fan and wants to wear this shirt every time it's clean... Sometimes even the second it's out of the dryer. Seems to be good quality, BUT a strange thing that we can't figure out is that it doesn't actually have all of the Ghostbusters-- it has Egon, Ray, Peter, then.... Ray again. Where's Winston?!?!
B00BW036TE|5|Great umbrella!  Perfect size for a toddler and super adorable!
B00AT0N5RG|4|It's excellent and very easy to tie around mah cranium!
B00H9HPB6K|4|This made a perfect baby shower gift, it was ADORABLE!!!
B00I6A6I52|5|good
B00EGGM29G|5|Been using this product for 30 years. Never disappoints. Best fitting underwear on the market and has consistently been produced with not only quality materials but quality workmanship.
B00VWEKOAE|2|It's nice not what I thought or planed on but it will do...it's nice though...
B006R99F68|5|I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it.  The quality was as expected and I think the price was good.
B00L4ZHKGC|5|My 3 years grandson love it.
B00D6NX9VK|5|My daughter loved it! Much better price than at stores we saw it at.
B00NO3VLB2|4|This is a lovely top which you can wear as casual or for more social outings. It is extremely comfortable and looks nice with either trousers or skirts. It was very nicely packaged and was received within the time expected. Very pleased.
B00DS2OADA|3|Flimsy, thin (not in a good way), and not well made. Parts of it look like there's about to be a hole already.
B008OHNB7U|5|I bought this bag for a specific event. But ended up loving it! Its well made and far more versatile than advertised. Would love another, in a different colour.
B00PRBJPVM|5|excelent
B004FEEZ76|5|Cute and effective at blocking sun. Only hat I have found which fits my five month old, so being cute is a bonus.
B00A4A9T5I|3|The gloves keep my hands nice and warm (great!), but they do a poor job of letting me interface with my phone. If I hold the phone in one hand and use the other (very carefully) to poke at the phone, then it sort of works; however, that does me no good when I have coffee (or something else in one hand) and just want to send a quick text message with the other.
B0077RDVFU|5|Being an individual with a 64 cm head, I was beyond exciting when this helmet actually rested on my head. The helmet was in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes.<br /><br />The leather liner on the inside adjusts along with the chinstrap, making it easier to fit the helmet on your head depending on your head size.<br /><br />The helmet is fairly heavy, and I don't recommend wearing it for extended amounts of time.<br /><br />Overall 9/10. Only complaint is the chinstrap is a little stiff and hard to use.
B009AC5BK8|5|If you love the Redskins and RGIII, then pick up this shirt!  It's comfortable, washes well and catches attenttion from passers by!
B00EAJNAPY|4|This cardi is fantastic; the color is a wonderful adobe brick color, the style and texture and the buttons are lovely.  This runs a tad large, but that's okay, it still hangs well.  I love all these sweaters and they launder well, absolutely no dry cleaning expense!
B005IZ0K9I|5|I LOVE these leggings and the are the perfect finishing touch to my 80s costume!  They are even better than the picture.  Note that they are hot pink, not a soft pink as the picture shows...but that is what I wanted and what I love about them!  Shipping was a little more than I like to pay, but as I said they were the perfect finishing touch to my costume!
B00P0FEZQ0|3|Its cute and looks like the picture shown but smaller than expected.
B00QM2SAO8|5|Just as described!
B00O9MJFAQ|5|Loves this for my little princes just turned 2 months ordered size 0-3 months fit her perfect!! Will purchase the blue one also when she's older
B0091EZMWC|5|I am in love with this kigu!!!<br /><br />1. I am 5'7\\" 190 pounds and it fits perfectly with room to spare if any of you plus size beauties are wondering about the sizing!<br /><br />2. The fabric is SOOOOOOOOOOOO soft!!! I feel like I am living in a cloud with this item!<br /><br />3. It has buttons instead of a zipper like other kigus. My other kigu has a zipper and it's really annoying and scratchy! Buttons on this are virtually non-existant when it comes to comfort AND they are super cute!<br /><br />4. The shipping was from China and SUPER fast!<br /><br />All in all I love this item! Can't wait to wear it every chance I get!
B00O3GZGME|3|Like the sarong, but a little &#34;pricey &#34;.
B00939SDUI|5|Love the fit
B00K5TC8TC|5|I bought this for what I'm guessing is an unusual reason: I was having a biopsy on an area of my breast and I was told to bring a sports bra for the extra support and to hold a small ice pack afterward. I couldn't imagine trying to put on one over my head after the procedure so I bought the zip front. It was wonderful. Exactly what I needed. I do feel like it will give me plenty of support when I'm actually able to exercise again, but I have not had the opportunity to try it yet.
B004PKXSNM|5|I bought this corset about 4 weeks postpartum with twins, and it was well worth it! Great product! Worth the price!
B004NY7RCI|5|I initially ordered the Leveret truck pajamas, and after my experience with them ordered a bunch more. I was extremely happy with the pajamas. Yes, as another reviewer says, they run small; but so do many other baby clothes which do not have their advantages. These pajamas are very soft and pleasant to touch; they are very thin, and yet warm - my baby was comfortable just in them with a light blanket in somewhat chilly nights. They came out well from the wash, and the patterns are very cute. This specific pajama made my husband smile when I brought the baby to him dressed in it, and baby and mom got a big hug. I am very happy with them, especially for the price.
B00N7EHGVM|4|Slightly smaller than expected, still love though.
B009ZHANZ6|5|Very bold colors and the material is thick enough I don't need another layer underneath. I listened to the previous comments that it fits snug so I ordered a large (I wear either a medium or large normally and do not have a large bust), and it fits perfectly. Very, very satisfied!
B00HB55BBK|5|I have this in 3 different colors, and it's all I wear. It's super comfortable and fits great. I'll probably need to buy new ones soon, though, because my current ones are starting to get stretched out.
B001IVY2I6|5|Even though I've read so many great reviews of these around the internet I was a little reluctant for some reason. Now I could kick myself for not ordering sooner. 2.5\\" seems to be pretty much standard as they've fit in all my shirts. The only way I've popped one off on accident was ripping a lanyard off my neck that I already had on when I was showing someone how they worked and the lanyard was trapped behind the magnet. If my shirt would have still been tucked in it just would have fallen to my belt line.
B007S64QDQ|5|Is a cute costume and seems to be made well.
B00LK0ENFC|2|I ordered these along with a pair of the regular, non-sateen, version.  The regular ones at my waist size fit perfectly.  These were a good inch or two from even being able to button them.  I checked the labels, inside and out, and they say they are my waist size - no way!  Length was fine, but be warned that waist sizes run way small.
B007S01VIU|5|Bought this for my 13 year old, took it in a little to make it fit more snug and air brushed accents on it.  Well made for a store bought costume.  Would buy from them again.
B009KO0MVE|5|Love the design.  Love the room and the weight of this wallet.
B007ILRU1G|3|Size is for the most part okay however the feet on this were huge
B00EVI2OAG|4|I bought a size L and feel t is true to its size and is quite flattering over the tummy area. I have used it over my skinny jeans to dress it down a bit but could also be used by itself as a short dress. The fabric is stretchy except for the beaded area which are not. I am very happy with it and am sure ti will come to good use.
B0057ZBL8I|5|I have thick legs yet I'm only 5,3 - 110 lbs this item fit perfect.  If you have larger legs I would say this item will fit a tad snug , it was perfect for my bachelorette part in Vegas .
B00EAPG8GG|2|Oh the original version of this pant was rad...the Frickin' Chinos I bought a couple of years ago  were stitched well, equipped with durable fabric & reinforced in high-stress areas (knees & inner stitching for skating hard!)& a cel phone pocket on the right leg...sadly what I got in the mail last week had all the durability of a pair of dress pants so I returned them.
B004S98O1Q|5|Ok
B001JBH160|5|Husband was happy, and Sears lost a sale<br />Pricing was decent and washed well<br />Would buy again in another color
B00KIL31BG|2|The dress was short and the sewing quality was very poor. The fabric is more similar to that of a Lycra swimwear.  Not flattering at all... I ordered an XL and i'm 5'3&#34; this dress barely reached my ankles.<br />I give it two stars because the seller did offer a refund, but only after I paid to return it to Asia. It was not worth spending any more money.
B00IPXZ7ZM|5|great
B008VI65RK|5|Nice quality t-shirt for the Batman lover. Great gift idea.
B003F44U0Y|5|The hipslimmer corset is amazing  I love it!!
B00LA53UA6|5|The reviews said it runs small. I normally wear a medium and I got an XL. It fits perfect and is super comfortable!! Best buy ever on Amazon!
B007SOMDIS|1|I loved the look of this dress but the sizing is nowhere near correct. I bought my normal size AND the size up just to make sure that I had it for vacation. I didn't notice much difference at all between the sizes but neither of them were even close to big enough.
B000YXBSZY|2|Agree with other people on the snags already in the stockings, I ordered nude so luckily you dont really notice them as you would in black. Def DONT order black...but they will do the trick for the look I am going for. Also the \\"seam\\" is pretty raised and not flush with the stocking, not a prob per se just an observation.
B006T5306G|5|Very flattering. Everything is covered and my husband likes!
B00B3VIWYG|5|In a one single package, they put it all with every item mentioned in the description with good protection and all in their own boxes. Very good deal.
B00R5B29TM|5|Good
B00IGE28BG|2|I ordered the 6/8.  These must be girls sizes.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 123 lbs and I thought I was going to have to cut this thing off me.  The material is not stretchy like you would expect &#34;jersey&#34; to be.  There is also no slit, or kick-pleat so you walk like a mummy.  You get what you pay for, folks.  Very poor design on this dress although the overall look is cute, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
B00FDV3S9G|5|Looks & fits great.
B008VAUNNK|3|Wrangler needs to start putting Extreme low rise versus low rise for their jeans. The fit is completely different for both of them.
B005GCBDKS|5|So fun! Get so many compliments on these.
B00GTCQGKQ|3|Thanks for fast delivery but this dress was huge. I normally wear the size 8 but I would rather order the size 4  for this.
B00JUM6D82|5|I bought these in the largest size available not knowing they were going to be huge on me (I'm a big guy) but I don't even care because they are so damn comfortable it's like slipping on some clouds
B00WG8QPS0|4|a little bit to small but would buy again
B00KCM89XG|1|Not a size XL at all!
B00GTU16YO|5|Very cute summer outfit is this Hello Kitty girls romper! I got this for my granddaughter and it fits her perfectly!
B00OJNHJF8|4|Starting a tradition this year and going to shop with my sister and niece.
B00IHJZTDO|5|came in as specified nice tee
B00E87WJMI|3|I am happy with the purchase.  fits a bit tight.  color is great.  length is short. not as it looks on the picture.
B001CVJZCA|1|I bought this backpack to carry the essentials (phone, keys, wallet, water bottle) for a 3-day music festival. It only has one large pocket, but I was still happy with how cute the bag was. Unfortunately, I only got to use it 2 days before the thread completely separated the shoulder straps from the bag. The fur started falling out as well. Granted, I was dancing and having a good time, but this bag is specifically intended to be used at these types of events. I was very dissappointed that the stitching & materials weren't sturdy enough to last. I'm attending another 3-day festival in a few weeks and plan to purchase the \\"ful Unisex Adult Ditty Mini Backpack\\" instead. Hopefully it will hold up.
B003543UOG|3|Great looking shorts. Runs a little on small side. I have several pairs of these shorts and from experience, always either hang dry them or dry at low heat only. If you dry them on regular heat like any normal load, the side pattern striped stitching towards the bottom of the shorts (where it creates that unique triangle shape) will shrink abnormally causing it to then shrivel up and look really goofy. Trying to iron them out doesn't work.
B0043D7N78|3|Fit and quality is great, But I found Bali has the same type just well made at less than half the price.
B004ARTYHY|5|Great product at an afforable price. These are very durable, well made, and they are very comfortable to wear over a 12 hour period.
B00S4ZXTT2|4|I bought a size up and I'm glad I did. A size was a looser fit. Love wearing this shirt when working out-- it really keeps me dry.
B00NQ74PFK|5|so far I've been wearing it since the 26 of February it has helped tremendously with my back I have a very big arch in my lower back causing me a lot of back pain as well as a 4wheeler accident but other than helping with my back has helped with my stomach it feels a little lose now so might go down a row in the next few days as of today it feels lose so yay!
B000IJA6K2|5|I love this bra. It's the second one I've bought, the other one lasted me over 3 years and is still usable, I just figured it was time for a new one. It is extremely comfortable and never falls down like most strapless bras.
B0031U0O02|3|Belt is sized large but is sturdy.
B00NAIQ9CW|5|This is the 2nd one I bought . I love them . They come fast. They fit perfect. They are very comfy.
B00ISQ0K6M|2|Shipping: Shipping was fine. I ordered this product May 23rd and received it on May 27th.<br /><br />Product: I was really excited about this shirt. I love Attack on Titan and the design. But these sizes are ridiculous. I ordered my shirt in a XL. This in no way was a XL. I would seriously considered this shirt to be a medium. Silly me, I have ran into this problem with Hot Topic's shirts before. It's like these shirts are meant for women with no bust, no shape, and you have to stand like a solider to probably wear the shirt due to the sleeves in the shoulders.<br /><br />Overall: I really do love this shirt, don't get me wrong. I think if you're considering to buy this shirt, you need to go to the store to actually see how it fits you. I'm now going to be out money for shipping to return the shirt. Just not worth it.
B007U46U1M|5|Arrived promptly.
B00HA67J4M|4|These were just ok;run large so size down.
B00Y2ES5DO|5|Cool product
B00BKRMEAG|3|Too small. Design is on the small side.  Color was beautiful. Fabric excellent.  Bodice sits high on breasts, not the right fit for my body type as I am large brasted.
B00DPQ8FTO|1|I ordered this as a Christmas present for my bearded man, shipping was perfect, came right on time and very quick. But when I received the shirt, it came as a WOMANS large. I thought &#34;adult tee&#34; was a mans shirt. So it was no big deal. Thought i'd just send it back after I e-mailed the seller, nicely. I might add. Its been nearly 3 months, and I've never been contacted! So not I'm stuck with a shirt that is too large for me, and way to small, with tiny little sleeves for my boyfriend. Thanks a bunch.
B000PUFIRA|5|You can spend a ton of money on straw hats and the first time you sit on it you are out a nice chunbk of change. OR you can spend substantially less and get what you pay for. This hat was a nice surprise because, although inexpensive, it looks good and is holding up quite well. Good job Dorfman!
B00U7780LW|4|Very nice, true to size
B00OZMBZF8|5|Cute dress I ordered small and fits fine i'm 5'1 135 lbs on the curvy side if that helps to figure what size others should buy. The material was thick enough no need to wear slip underneath.
B000AAY46G|1|I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them. <br /> <br />Thank you, Robert Butz
B005NJXNES|4|I feel a bit old-school in this skirt, but it is perfect for work.  Hits just above the ankle on me (I am 5'5&#34;) and has a high comfortable waist.  The fabric is heavy, so don't expect it to be cool in the summer, though is nice and warm in the winter.
B00O5MRA02|5|I have them on now, very comfortable
B00P6VBKTS|3|They seem like really good socks, but look surprisingly big.  Big enough, I considered returning, but I had already taken the plunge and thrown away all the packaging.  So, I'm hoping that after a wash they'll shrink a bit.  If not, I'll gift them to someone with bigger feet in colder climates (I think these are more than I need for Hawaii hiking).
B00JGHLSEA|5|My daughter loved this and looked cute on.  I did follow recommendations and sized up, usually by size 5 and got a 6.  My daughter is tall but lean.
B00DUWLHZ2|4|These are much better than the silicone nose pads and prevents my glasses from slipping down my nose due to my very greasy face. The opening may be too small for some glasses, but I managed to push it through the widest point which was about 8 mm. They do the job nicely. Only problem I seem to have is with it getting caught in my long hair. To avoid that, I usually flip it upside down, put on my glasses and then flip it right side up and adjust the position. I've given a pair to my mom and sister and they both love how it keeps their glasses from sliding off their face.
B002Y2UYNU|5|GREAT JACKET!!
B0027T75C8|5|Excellent
B000PQHTSA|5|Definitely love it!
B00GNJL49S|4|They are advertised as 'athletic fit' but I would have liked it tapered in a little more at the waist.
B00J49XG0Y|2|For what ever reason, the cap never fit right...one size was too small and the next size to big?  Plus it never looked good on me.
B000C7KFVU|4|Very satisfactory fit and quality.
B00C79DMI4|5|Purchased as swim top cover up.  Really cute.  Size was spot on.  Laundered in washer & line dried, no shrinkage, dried quickly.  Too thin, with burn out design, to wear without cami, tank or swim suit top underneath.  I would purchase this again.
B00EQHE4LE|5|Fits great and feels wonderful.
B00HG7H4YK|3|I'm giving this 3 stars. Let me start by saying this is a wonderfully made replica of the Oblivon keyblade. It's detailed and the colors are on point. My delivery came much earlier than expected considering from where it shipped from and for that I am greatful.<br />Where this piece goes wrong is the fact that it is made of wood and not of the PVC it is claimed to be. Even says it on the packing slip. Also, there is no clear coat sealant on the wood to keep the color from fading or scratching off. So basically paying $200 for wood seems a bit silly. But like I said it's well made otherwise and I'm on the side of happy with my purchase but only just so. I wish this item came as it was advertised.
B000F1NFQK|5|THIS IS A GREAT CARD HOLDER. IT IS WELL MADE AND LOOKS GREAT. HOLDS A LOT OF CARDS AND IS VERY DURABLE
B004XDJDOE|1|This dress was a waste of my money , was ripped and terrible quality, I really disappointed with Amazon to sale this kind of trash , yes trash .
B00RYLWVCI|5|The problem with being an epic Olympic-level runner is that my legs typically can't fit in the fashionable pants of the day. Not that I'd want to wear them, but skinny jeans? Fugghedaboutit. I can't even fit in the slim-fit pants.<br /><br />These Dickies Regular Straight jeans seem to be a comfortable compromise for those like me with Adonis-size thighs and Herculean calves. And they look about as skinny as I would want them to.<br /><br />Now I can finally fit in with all the hipsters at the craft brewhouse after my epic 3-milers! Thanks Dickies!
B00JHCS766|5|perfect pj's for summer , I live in a tropical country and this pijamas are perfect for the summers here. love !!!
B00CCHL7N8|5|Scarf is a beautiful, rich purple and keeps me warm! It's thin but wide so you can layer it up.
B00BOVDF3S|5|These socks are really comfortable. They are hella soft and cute too. I can't wait to get more colors! Get them
B00HYJJYDO|5|My grand daughter loved Elmo...but the glitter from the shirt was everywhere
B005CSOGFU|5|Ordered these for my 20 yr old son, along with a few other brands<br />because I wasnt sure which he'd like best. He said these were great.<br /> Not too heavy, not too lightweight, warm, cozy and a good<br />length for his 6'2&#34; frame.
B00859OQM6|5|Beautiful scarf and shipping was SUPER fast. Thanks a bunch!!!
B000JHHF20|5|Carhart jeans are better made than Levi jean.  A couple of years ago I started buying Carhart jean because Levi's quality and fit has declined while their price has increased.
B00L37WEJY|4|Love the color mix
B009LDPA2U|4|i got this shirt for myself for christmas. it is very cute and fits pretty good except the sleeves are a little short on me. it may just be my arms but its not that big of a problem if i try to stretch it out. it may look better on skinnier girls. so i reccomend it.
B00HS9HY14|5|I ordered these for my bridesmaids and am very happy with the quality of them. Awesome customer service as well! I would highly recommend!
B0012UWDT8|4|Love it!! Great looking shirt
B00MX14KQ4|1|Quality was very poor, material was very frayed and not at all like pictured. Not satisfied with purchase
B0097M9TOA|5|The best undershirt
B000XB2M70|5|I liked the first one I ordered so much I ordered a second one in a different color!  Great for poolside
B009DNWH2O|1|They fit fine but they smell awful just like the other reviewers mentioned.  I also bought fleece line leggings from what I thought was a totally different company but these are exactly the same. Disappointing
B00006G9B0|5|This classy cape came out of the box ready-to-wear having been packed so nicely with tissue-paper padding and plastic to protect it. It looks great on me! This is the kind of service I remember from shopping at Field's when I was growing up in Chicago years ago. I bought my prom gown there in 1966 and it was deliverd to my house a few days later in a signature green truck, on a hanger, all pressed, with white muslin basted along the hem to protect it from dirt during transit! I felt like a princess!<br />Back to the cape -it fits well, drapes well and is just about perfect. I'm very pleased. There is one thing though - I believe the description mentioned &quot;patch pockets&quot; and there are none. Oh, well. They would have been handy.<br />My shopping also included a box of dark chocolate Frango mints as no &quot;visit&quot; to Field's is ever complete without that treat.<br />A classy cape from a classy store. Thanks!
B007IYF3R6|1|cheap made fur feels like a cheap rug
B00KVITVE2|1|Too stiff, too small, hard to deal with and its heavy!  Not happy with it at all!
B009Q2129G|5|Again, something i cant seem to find in stores! I only find them in weird fits or weird material. the price its off, but I guess not since it looks like &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
B00JGPNKES|5|Beautiful and excellent quality.
B00RBF6M86|1|it was cheap and dint look like the picure
B007G3DQ7I|5|This shirt is good quality, love the colors, and versatile for a great price! Came true to size would definitely order again.
B00IWYW4DC|5|Good Product, Good Quality. My daughter loves them. Great value for the price.
B00IJST27W|3|By using the size chart provided, I selected size 12 but when I received it, the size actually fits too big. I think a size 8-10 would have been a perfect fit. At 5' 4&#34;, the length was okay for me.  None-the-less, it was a great buy. Just what I expected for my money.
B00DRJD1T8|4|The snowman is very cute and well done; however, I wish it was bigger.  I will have to surround it with other smaller Christmas patches in making my shirts.
B00JRUYSAW|3|first off, I hate that this is called plus size.  I just have large breasts, but am not a plus sized women.  The bra is very nice.  Very pretty, but runs small.
B00Y16HOO4|5|Loved this shirt! It fit perfectly and I rocked it for the 4th of July!
B00H58FYQK|4|Love the The look of it and fits as expected The only thing is the hood is a little small overall I love this jacket for my son
B00I2NYXDW|5|Ordered one to wear out casually. Was really happy with the fit and quality of the t-shirt. Can't beat it for the price!
B010MXH78W|2|This shirt was too small to be called a medium, you'll rip it if you're not careful.
B00GFE0P9Q|4|nice.. my husband is a Republican legislator so this little scarf gets used for campaign events.. fun
B00722RHF0|4|The shade aspect of these sunglasses is pretty cool. But the biggest perk, in my book, is their understated ability to act as a mustache preventer.<br /><br />I was sitting by my backyard pool yesterday and was wearing my USA shades. I had one of those stupid cups-of-soup that you microwave, then eat straight out of the container. It was tomato soup, so rather than spend too much time using a spoon, I simply drank straight from the container. The lower segment of the US blocked my upper-lip from getting tomato soup grime on me. In fact, the lower edge of Texas cut down the severe flow of tomato soup into my mouth... so rather than almost drowning in soup, I got just the perfect amount at the perfect speed.<br /><br />These sunglasses are perfect.
B00NP3J4MY|4|You need to steam tall the wrinkles all of the yime.
B00FRQWJZQ|2|These run small.  Also the liner is a thick round disk that is very noticeable with a light or patternless shirt.
B001L9Y0IM|1|It is a very cheap product. And, I fell in love with the color on this picture. The real color is very different. It is bright grass-green, which was not what I was going for.
B00DQY4LNO|3|Just received my Fan Guide. In the listing, it states that there are 180+ colors, but that is not true. This is the 2013 edition and there are only 170 colors. The guide is still useful.
B003BWICZE|4|This hat is such a pure white, that it is amazing. It fits my head like it was made especially for me. In the summer it even protects me from the sun. The material it is made of is strong and durable and easy to clean. The price was one of the reasons I bought it.
B00G4JQIRA|5|I bought this jacket in black and pink for my 7 year old daughter. The size I got her was 6/7 and it fit s her perfect with a little bit of room to spare. My daughter is on the smaller side, which means this fits true to size. The jacket came in good condition with no strings hanging. The material is very soft, has a good weight to it and well made. The jacket is perfect for spring and fall. My daughter loves her jacket and wears it to school. I wish the pockets were real other than it's really nice. I highly recommend this jacket for any little girl.
B00KNU0NCW|5|though the straps on this dress are little big because I'm a petite this dress fits absolutely wonderfully and looks so great and makes me feel so great it's just perfect. The fabric is just right its not too thick but its not to thin its definitely not cheap material. I just love this dress its great it's everything I wanted.just add a great petticoat and you've got an absolutely awesome retro 50's look.
B00D3YQFO0|5|Great style--nice fabric-- fits well
B001P3OXXG|5|These did exactly what they were supposed to do. Invisible under clothing. Kept things smooth and classy all the way. Highly recommend.
B00IZHK1BS|5|I needed black & white leggings for a performance.  These are very comfortable and wash beautifully.  The black is pure black and the white is pure white.
B004RL0LTI|4|I thought the belt material would be more like the belt I had in the military. Thicker.
B0054420O6|3|These are decent enough pants for sure.  The 34W-32L sizing was accurate (I'm 6-0 and 165#), but I was really expecting something more suited for crawling around on lumber than on polished floors.  That said, I was happy enough with the construction and price to keep them.  The knees on these will last a lot longer than on a pair of my Dockers.<br />I would like the side pockets to be deeper.  Keys and coins too easily fall out when sitting in a car seat.  If there was a zippered or Velcro'd side or leg pocket I would trust it to hold my phone but these pants don't feature that.  The open leg pocket that is there is a little too narrow to slide a phone into but it's just deep enough to hold a pliers or marker.  No hammer loop, and these sure don't have the utility of cargo pants although I wasn't buying those.  And that's about it.  No frills, and they look good.
B00JQT0OJS|5|Perfect!!!
B005CSOJ2U|1|Fabric seems a bit skimpy and I am a size 8, ordered a large, and it is too tight. How will it fit after I wash it? These sizes are too small.
B00BQKNF5K|4|This looked snug on the model, so I ordered a size up. Could have worn the smaller one, but this is such thin fabric it clings.  Not a problem.  I love the graphic and have never seen anything like it.
B00HAY71YC|4|Nice but I like  cotton
B005ZBNRKY|5|This is just a very nice wallet.<br /><br />All natural hemp. Looks and feels good. Wears quite good.<br /><br />This wallet has plenty of compartments to help you keep all your stuff organized.<br /><br />Have have had several over the years and always get another one.
B00LO592F4|1|Very flimsy material, cheap thin and very wrinkled and even after ironing still looks wrinkled. Not impressed won't buy another.
B00604UC4O|5|Love these!  They fit perfectly!  The lace at the waistband is sexy and comfortable.
B00IPQIJ6S|5|it is beautiful!  Wish it came in other colors.<br />Love it!  Fits perfectly!
B005I34C1C|5|Husband loves them
B00LUN581C|5|Great for the holidays...fit as expected.
B00DRKKVL8|5|I ordered the Azules Women's Ponte Roma Stripe Maxi Skirt in black & white (size L) from the seller 82 Days and I absolutely love it! The skirt fits great and is a good length on me, which is sometimes hard to find given the fact that I'm 5'9\\" tall and very curvy (35\\" waist and 45\\" hips). It has a good amount of stretch and flows really nicely. I do have to wear it the way it appears on the model, however, in order for it to be true maxi length on me (no folded waist band). Something to note that I didn't realize until I had ordered 3 of these Azules maxi skirts is that there are 3 different material types to choose from for this maxi (Rayon Span, Poly Span, and Ponte Roma) and depending on which one you choose, you'll see a big difference in the quality makeup of the skirt. This was the first maxi I ordered and it is the Ponte Roma material, which is a thicker polyester/rayon/spandex blend material and is definitely not see-through, even in lighter colors. The second maxi I ordered was the Rayon Span material, which is a thinner rayon/spandex blend material that can be see-through in the lighter colors. The third maxi I ordered was the Poly Span material, which is a polyester/spandex blend material that looked too much like a cheap spandex material for me to even want to try on, so I returned it and cannot comment on the fit. I now know to stick with the Ponte Roma and Rayon Span maxis only. With that being said, if you get the right type, this maxi skirt is super cute and gets lots of attention (I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it). I will definitely buy more.
B00HEUXCT0|5|EXCELLENT price, Perfect in EVERY way.
B00DV0G73A|5|I love this light sweater tunic. It fits perfectly and is a great length at mid- thigh. I wish I had more of this in different patterns.
B00YP2TVDG|4|Awesome for the price. Legs a little tight as others stated but just need a good stretch to loosen them up. Ordered a large, I'm 5'3&#34; and 135 lbs.
B00FO3AR6K|5|I like this scarf. It is not small. It fits me well! And the price is reasonable!
B00NB96W8G|5|Nice Belts! 😁
B0058EDCBM|5|This vest is perfect we need it for a wedding and the color matches perfect and we love the paisley design and we recieved a tie with it which we did not realize we were getting when we ordered it so that was a nice surprise
B00LFJ5BKO|5|Love this suit! The material is a little thin, and you NEED to buy at least one size up, but otherwise it's absolutely adorable!!
B002UG30YA|5|I was sent the wrong item initially. I emailed seller at about 10:00 p.m. on a Saturday, 6 days before my event. Imagine my joy when co-owner, Ray, replied within 15 minutes!!! Correct item arrived on Tuesday!!<br />The costume was of far better quality than I had hoped. The material is a thick flannel, which hangs well. The apron and fob cap have cute details. Fit was great... I am an XL 44D, and I ordered the plus size to avoid a tight chest. It's generous in the waist, and it is a little long ( I'm 5'5&#34;)
B0042M4D00|5|Soft, great quality. Still looks like new after a couple washes. My son wore it at his Dr. Seuss Birthday-Party.
B0076JWZ3S|1|Too small. Not sized correctly. Need to return, or exchange for a larger size.  Package came with no return label.
B00DS40EY2|5|my son is 5'6&#34; & 110 lbs , the length & waist fit perfectly. will definitely recommend these pants. and the price is right.
B00457WW82|3|I was wrong with the size. So note that for M you better order L. But generally it is a good support for nursering mamas :-)
B00KSZCR6M|5|Love it
B008EBUN7C|5|What a beautiful scarf!!!  Excellent quality, beautiful rich blue color...everything I hoped it would be.
B00ZRTXNIU|1|Be careful!!! I ordered the one like the picture... Red print with sleeves... It came as a tank romper, no sleeves!!! And I am usually size med. I got a large and it's still a tad snug.
B0067CREUO|4|Sent a pair to my son in WI and he hasn't used them because they aren't heavy enough for Wisconsin's frigid winter temps!
B00PFDBMJA|4|Sexy  but I wish it was connected
B00KZ1H4T4|5|Very cute headband!! Good quality too!
B00E97KDNO|5|great.. love this jacket :)
B00CWACCU2|1|I hate this top it runs way too small and states it has bat wing sleeves.  It does not!!!!  It has regular  fit sleeves, which are tight.<br />I am very disappointed in this top. What a waste of my hard earned money.  Unfortunately it will cost me money to return I, therefore I<br />am stuck with it.
B00K1953DE|3|The picture is nicer than the item, but it isn't bad. Luckily, I was buying this for a 10 year olds birthday.
B009LJAK7Y|4|Person that received the gift liked the shirt but said it had a funny smell to it when it arrived. No other problems though.
B0064EYS2M|5|I purchased these underwear a long time ago in Wal-Mart. But they don't carry them anymore. So I have been looking for them  for a long time now!! I couldn't find them anywhere. So I looked on Amazon and finally I found them. I love this underwear it stays in place. No problems at all....I would recommend these to anyone.
B00XA8EFGE|4|I like!
B009NIPISO|5|I couldn't find this cap anywhere, except for your wonderful online store! Thanks for all your wonderful, fast service!  A+A+A+A+
B0006ZJMM6|5|I buy Izod American Chinos because of the fit they almost feel tailored.  And I buy them through Amazon from Bealls because they carry the full range of sizes, including 29 inch leg length.
B00KTOME42|4|but to small not US 1xor2x.
B00KU83GKI|4|I like it
B002BJHZ1A|3|Good shirt but not red.<br />The color is more like a pinkish light red.<br />Looks good but different from picture.<br />Fits well.
B000TGWFNK|3|As expected, I ordered a medium and fits large large.
B00A7FQRGE|3|Hat is funky and all but you need to have an elephant-sized head to have a good fit. I only wear this hat when I want to look a little ridiculous.
B00CO9NCDM|3|Buttons don't work properly, skips
B00OFVTYRA|5|Got the pink one for my wife and she loves it , both as skirt and dress. Ordered the blue one as well.
B00F0TH2X4|5|Fit is good and pretty style that doesn't look like grandma's bra.  It can be hard to find that combination in larger sized bras.
B00E0EPHVE|4|Was a little snug but over all a very nice dress! My daughter loved it! The color is vibrant :)
B0018OLDWG|5|Levi 's are always a good purchase
B001FOR2CY|5|Nice strong belt.  Adjusts to any waist.  Sturdy material.  Reminds me of the belts we wore as cub scouts.
B004V9R2BG|4|Cherokee is my go to brand for comfort and durability.
B009RHNMI4|5|Wear it all the time. Great price.
B00M94VQ1C|5|This is such a classy and great bathing suit top. It looks even better in person and I love it!  I highly recommend this.
B00LPMGM90|1|BEWARE of tariffs Great Britain imposes on packages from America which make any return, even flat-rate, cost upwards of $25 without insurance and easily $80 to insure for $65! &#34;Love CASH&#34;mere is happy not to have to warn of this. They know this as they smugly issue a return authorization which insists that you insure any return without any help from them. You will also be faced with having to fill out daunting customs forms which even most issuers aren't sure how to fill out. Any mistakes and your package is confiscated by British customs.<br />If you're still interested, know that this men's one-size hat is so tight it would have to be stretched to fit a pinhead. Besides looking skimpy, it's not smart because there is less insulating value when it has to be stretched thin. It's so thin you can't even see any difference in thickness when it's doubled over your ears.
B005WA63DG|5|I really love these shirts - since buying my first ones i have purchased these shirts for my employees who work out in the field , my kids for waiting at the bus top and a few more for myself so that during the winter I can wear one every day. Wonderfully soft and very warm but thin enough to not add bulk or make my shirts too tight-  these are my new favorite article of clothing- LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!
B007HQVO8W|4|Very sexy, I bought it to spice up a little and my husband definitely enjoyed it, sexy nurse lol. I would definitely recommend it
B00AAJIRUQ|5|I love these gloves, but they are a little tight in the wrists.  Worth it to go one size larger.
B003VRXGQ4|4|I was looking for good socks for my son, and came across these here on Amazon. They served their purpose, but they were a bit smaller than I thought they should have been. I ordered the right size, but they were a bit small for my son's feet. He doesn't have large feet, they're average, so they should have fit perfectly. We were still able to use them, but I thought they fit a bit on the small side, so beware. Ordering a size larger should be just right.
B00R5L0XYK|5|If you're small, these may feel a bit bulky, otherwise it's a wonderfully crafted product when you're suffering through the presence of Aunt Flo.
B00FNHQY1Y|5|Best board shorts I've ever owned! Highly recommend and is worth every penny.
B00JTY2DJ4|5|Very nice
B00K175MRS|5|Exactly as picture, good feel, room for what I need and fast deliver.
B005FYNXGO|5|These are just thick enough for daily use, but not so thick as to make shoes uncomfortably tight. My husband appreciates the quality - we will definitely buy again.
B00HV6FXT4|5|I love this shirt, liked so much i bought the blue one too.  Wish they came in other colors.  Perfect for wearing to my job, very comfortable, different than the plain old boring polo style shirt, and doesnt shrink up like many polos do that makes it hard to keep tucked in.  This one tucks well with just the right length.  I have fairly broad shoulders and prefer atheletic cut shirts and the shoulder cut and fit is perfect!
B00LISZQ6G|5|Follow the advice of other reviewers and order up.  Quality is excellent for a lightweight and stylish look.
B00NMY1SQQ|5|Wife loved them
B00OS1NEM8|5|My daughter wanted to get this for her brother for a birthday present, he loved it!!!!!
B00UNV0SAS|5|Nice fitting shirt.
B0024KF31U|5|Anybody looking for a long, absorbent bathrobe should look no further!  This robe is thick, absorbent, comfortable, and very long.  Want to look like a Jedi while you dry off from a nice hot shower or bath?!  This robe can make that happen!<br /><br />It doesn't come a with a lightsaber, but what self-respecting Jedi would want a catalog ordered lightsaber anyway?<br /><br />Climb into this robe and begin your new life Padawan!
B00LA5VBNE|5|It's a high quality product, very useful, very attractive because of the pretty color.
B0089ZKXUK|5|These panties are so great!<br /><br />So, of course they are all ruined now. I bought them a couple months ago. You know how whenever you get pretty, new panties, you will start your period no matter where you are supposed to be in your cycle? Well, that happened. That was ok, it only ruined a few pairs. Then my sister did the laundry so now they're all a weird gray-brown color.<br /><br />But, as long as you know how to do laundry like a real adult, then you'll be fine.<br /><br />I got the medium. I'm 5'2&#34; 111 lbs and they fit wonderfully.
B00ES53NZ2|2|too small
B00YE152GI|1|Super cheap material and way too translucent. The edges were ready to fray out of the package.
B00PCAD0DW|5|I ordered this jacket for my daughter who lives in Michigan and I had it sent to her with all of the recent snow storms in the cold weather that they're having this year this was the perfect jacket for her. She absolutely loves it and she says it keeps her very warm to the point where she actually sweats wearing it I think it was an awesome purchase.
B00L36MTEA|1|I feel like I'm swimming in this sweater, not flattering at all :( I love the color tho
B00KTJLWAO|5|My husband loved this Christmas gift.  I read the comments of other purchasers and the size was perfect.  Absorbent and warm for lounging after a soak in the hot tub.
B001BXPVYK|5|Scared the crap out of my kids, neighbors kids, adults and more! Had to do some slight modifying to fit my face, just a little trimming but its great! Also won me the costume contest at work and a free day off! Worth the price if you know how to do effects make up!
B009GGVU6W|5|Super price and super fit.....you just can't go wrong.
B00GOI8DMY|3|Quality of product not the best......fabric is very thin.
B0044NUTO6|4|Cute. Sexy. Hot. I Love Them. And they came pretty quick :) great product.<br />If your looking to buy sexy under wear Groovin is great
B00NA7E2ZE|5|really cute socks for my daughter, loves them but she wears the banned book ones more then these.
B005SVILLQ|3|The reason why it's okay is because of the shape on the front part of the hat it kinda slants back but i'll wear it into shape. Plus it's not a trucker type hat like in the picture with the holes & its not snaps it's straps, not trying to sound to negative but you get what you pay for. But overall I like the hat girls are going to be all over me cuz I can catch em.
B00LU59Q04|4|My husband is Italian and our chihuahua loves him. My husband is dyslexic.  Need I say more?
B00IOBTH0Q|5|This is a gorgeous outfit!!
B00QFX5SB2|5|I have a 31 waiste and was concerned because I fell between the sizes. I got the large though and it fit like a dream.  Very supportive and comfy.  These are great!!
B005SN5I74|5|Very satisfied with this quality product.
B00S4QTQ5W|5|I absolutely love this dress! I do have to pin it at the shoulders to keep it in place but it's totally worth it because it's so adorable. I've gotten lots of compliments
B00IGZWQYE|3|Ok trunks. Rum small and short
B00KCWNETU|1|They stated was women's!!! Unless they consider a 12 yr old there is no way they were women's size
B008VVRS2S|5|Needed some black leggings for my 4 yr old who will only wear this style pant. She is tall at about 42&#34; and I knew I would need something a little larger so I ordered the 5T. As most said they are long and would fit skinny kids. These were a little long which was expected but not so long they look funny. Just enough room to grow and be able to wear one more year so I'm glad I went with the size up for her. They are thin but good quality material and will last. Definitely a good buy will be buying more as needed.
B009JKIHA2|5|This hat is a little too big, but that's easy to remedy with some foam around the inside.  The hat is GORgeous...
B00PFL8060|3|Again , The sizing chart should be redone. I ordered a size too big and it barely fits my girls
B00I1RLBZC|5|I saw a guy walking out of a store wearing this shirt and after I figured out it was a Seinfeld joke shirt, I had to get one.  Found it on Amazon.  Good price, quick shipping, and the shirt is nice quality too.
B004NRNR5G|5|Great compared to all the other sites this one really outdid itself. Thank you all for making ordering easy for me.
B002JIO318|5|This wallet is so soft and supple. It's easy to recognize the quality. Lot's of credit card slots and places for other important cards. In my opinion, it's a Great Wallet.
B00K5ZIUDY|3|It's pretty but I wouldn't say it's one size fits all.  It fits more like a size 14.  So, if you are larger than this... Pass on this.
B00TFARWXY|3|Got size 10 for my slim 10 year-old and it fit right in width but was like an 8 in length. She has a Justice swimsuit that is a size 10 and is about the same width, but longer. The fabric on this Kanu suit isn't very stretchy, so it was uncomfortable. The quality seems nice otherwise. The colors are vivid and would go with a lot of shorts, .
B002HE0VBK|3|Not What I expected,but it helps with a Lil fullness. I don't dont think the silicone was shaped correctly in accordance to different shapes and sizes that we all come in. Honestly I think they should've made it a lil more rounded instead of oval. I might wear it once in a while which isn't What I inticipated in terms of daily wear  enhancement.
B0036L5XRK|5|Given as gift the parents lived it!
B006ZEQOIC|5|I really love this top! It's super sexy and has a great fit. It's like your favorite Tee from the front, but has a surprise in the back!<br /><br />I must say though, although the Small fit me perfectly (34'' chest and 28'' waist), you can't really wear a bra with this top and have the same effect. Also, the material is rather thin. I got the black, so no see-thru problems for me, but if you get it in another color, I can imagine how it could be a little more revealing (Go with the black!).<br /><br />The top can also be somewhat adjusted to your size since the back is like a corset, although the string used to tie the corset is a little thin and silky, so you have to double... even triple knot it to keep it from opening.<br /><br />All of this said: The item for the price is fantastic! I receive so many compliments everytime  I wear it! And have already had a couple of friends order this top as well. I highly recommend it.
B000I12I56|4|Great apron, I was expecting this Apron to be a longer one then how it was advertise , I thought it would go to my knees, This one is average fit, I am 5'10 so it is short on me, it goes just below my stomach , Other than that! Great quality Apron,
B007CLSUES|3|I would advise ordering a size or two smaller, the back is adjustable which is nice if it were a bit small... but for me is not the case for me. It would look best on those with broad hips.
B002G4IF0U|1|When I first ordered this dress, I was pretty excited. It looked great in the picture, and the fabric seemed very metallic colored and nice. However, when I got the package and opened it, I had no idea that the dress in the package was the dress that I ordered a few days ago. The material was much darker and seemed a little cheap, and instead of being metallic, it was charcoal gray with millions of sparkles tossed onto it. When I tried it on, I found it to be too big and the dress shed a pound of glitter onto my floor. Unless you want to look like a Disney fairy, I do not recommend this dress.
B00BSE0I68|5|Excellent Quality
B00BLXL7B6|1|Simply they did not stay on my feet.  Also very thin, I would have liked something a little more substantial.
B00NZR9NSA|3|It doesn't look as it looks in the picture but overall quality and design are acceptable. Considering the price of the dress, it is pretty good.
B006JH6XXG|4|The Dockers fit well except they are a little tight in the waist.  Buying online is different than buying in the store where one can try slacks on.  It seems each pair of the same size fits differently, so trying them on is a definite benefit to buying online.  Finding D2 Dockers in stores is the problem.  All in all, I'm happy with my Dockers, but I've got to make sure I don't gain any weight!  LOL
B00LG0FW56|5|Prettier in person.  Lovely scarf
B008SGB55M|5|This looks and feels great! very thick and authentic. I would definetly recommend this to another person who is interested in buying armor. Thanks!
B00BDVCBUW|5|I REALLY like this product. It fits well, feels comfortable, looks very nice. My wife has washed it several times now and it still looks and fits as well as the first time I wore it. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a t-shirt with a pocket (an additional plus) who expects good value for the money.
B005Q12R8G|5|I bought this for my Halloween costume and it's awesome.<br />It's exactly as stated in the detailed description (stretchy, thin, long, comfortable)<br /><br />I was really happy to see that it doesn't look nor feel cheap.<br />It's almost see-through, so you'll have to wear something underneath (a black shirt for example).
B00PFDBMJA|3|This lace has no stretch which is rather uncomfortable when walking. Almost a good fit if It wasn't for the lace not stretching.
B0002TORIU|5|product arrived on time and the fit is just as expected which is good.
B0057XFQXG|1|These jeans are not of standard size, as in traditional marks such measures are very small, for example, my size is 42 and this brand should I buy size 46 to carve carving like 42 brands. Wont buy again.
B003AGACQ8|5|Excellent
B00ICT4XEU|2|These are OK, but here's the problem:  They are NOT AM Landen brand, at least not what I received.  In fact, the three pairs that arrived are not even the same brand among the pairs.  Two were labeled &#34;Delightful&#34; and the 3rd was labeled &#34;Zocks.&#34;  They also are not thigh high, despit ebeing advertised as such.<br /><br />Now, the seller, Jam Closet was very responsive and offered to take back the items or discount them.  So they offer good customer service. But their response that their &#34;factory in China manufactures these&#34; doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They are either AM Landen brand (they are not) or they're not (they are not).<br /><br />That said, they appear decent for the price and they fit true to size, running perhaps ever so slightly small.  The items are advertised as thigh high.  The size we ordered was Medium (2-4) for our daughter.  She has a petite frame and a height of 5'2&#34; and there is no way these are thigh high on her.  They are over the knee by about 3 inches or so, but no more.<br /><br />Overall they are decent, but the ad should just read what they are to avoid confusion.
B005KGL170|2|Im beginning to see a trend with this company. Maybe they are just different in their production than other places but again another product from this company has poor quality, material and measurements. What I mean by measurements is that the size will be US Large equivalent but have size Small arms in terms of width, very wide neck, very tight torso. I would just steer clear unless you are absolutely in love with the way it looks. That is its only redeeming quality. It looks pretty good but close up is bargain basement quality.
B00RCM4YLK|4|The bathing suit was great! It was just the right size for like cup size just a little small around like my back, but otherwise I got alot of compliments and its really cute!!
B00328HRAS|5|They are comfortable and fit well.
B00CVQOLD8|3|It fits but not as well as I'd like. I'm L and this is more comfortable for a M if you order a L
B009SNBDWO|4|the wig shed when i first got it but other than that it looks real and didnt get ruined when i used a straightener on it, all round its a pretty good wig
B001T8MAPU|4|Love l'eggs
B002HRS2JA|5|I bought this cover to replace one I'd had for years that had been patched with duct tape.  It actually still worked fine but didn't look great.  This new one is made out of a softer, slightly textured plastic than my old one and I prefer the look and feel of it over my old one.  Being softer, I think will be less susceptible to tears and will probably last even longer than my old one.  I haven't had a chance to test it out in the rain but believe it will do a nice job of keeping my head dry.  It fits nicely over my size 7 hat with a 3 1/2 brim.  There is enough room for about a 7 inch crown, but it can be smushed easily into the pinch and crease for a more custom look.
B002EL2WPO|4|Is well made and has a decent capacity for stuff.  Overall a good wallet.
B00793K6A0|5|Very good product and super soft and form fitting and have room for pouch area so I stay comfortable! Would buy again!
B00NKM2YKE|4|Good  quality button.
B000GACW4G|5|This case works perfectly! I've used it to run and the clip hold the ipod in place perfectly on my gym shorts band. As for protection, I've dropped it about 2 times since I got it and it keeps on playin'!! The only thing that is and issue is I have an adapter for it to play through my system in my car and the case is a little too small around the headphone port for the adapter to go in...if that makes sense....but it works fine if i squish it around a little :) its definitely worth the extra cost compared to other cases. my favorite part is definitely the clip. i was worried about running with it, but it is great...
B0088X2ESM|5|So comfortable and did the job!
B008AQBHY4|5|Love it
B00ZV61VOW|5|Bigger than some of my hats. Its going to Europe.
B008DD3RJM|4|Overall it's a good looking gown, although the material is a little more 'plastic-y' than other satin items I've seen.<br /><br />Had some minor issues with the transaction however. Shipping was slow taking 3 days before the item was even in the mail, then receiving the wrong size. It turns out the one they sent fit, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but realistically they made a mistake in the order. Initial emails to attempt a return were speedy but eventually I was told that the size I ordered wasn't actually in stock anyway.
B00DC3O2PG|5|I got the medium (I'm usually 6-10) and it fit well. It's not loose like the picture, it fits pretty tight. I'm more of a pear shape, but it was still long enough for me to wear only tights with it.
B005CSOO3Y|5|6' 1&#34; comes just under my knee. Good fit and pockets!!
B0049P5MBO|5|The clips are easy to use, and the bows are pretty without being too much.  The texture of the fabric gently grips my toddlers fine and thin hair to stay in.  Better yet, it does not pull or get caught so removal is easy.  She can play for hours with this bow on when others do lot last as long.  If your little girl also has that in-between length hair that keeps getting in her eyes, this will do the trick!
B00KDLQ6U4|5|Very soft Tee. Luv the Blue.
B00OVZF82K|3|Material is kind of thin.
B0030BEXU4|1|We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform's website, and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length (the 36 was more like a 34 or 32), and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit. They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges. They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support.  The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it \\"mostly\\" fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way.
B00HYYJBF0|5|Very cute. I loved the quality of the shirt
B0018P06LE|5|Love levis..fit good..
B00V7X0JS2|4|These come marked with strange sizes. I ordered M, but received XL. I think this has to do with the intended market. It looks like the labels are in Chinese.
B000CEFV8U|5|Just what we needed.  Speedy delivery too!
B007EH86JY|5|Love this hat! You can roll it up and take it with you anywhere.
B00D1K3J5E|3|Although the costume looks great, it is quite uncomfortable. First boning in the stomach area is bothersome, the costume has no lining so it's itchy, and it does run a bit small.<br />I am 5'2 bust 34C, waist 27, hips 36 and I ordered a medium. At first, the costume was stiff and the boning in the ab area made it stiffer and it also felt a bit snug around the bust, top back, and underarms. I decided to keep it and make some changes that would help make it comfortable for me to wear. First I removed the ab or waist boning in the front, then I washed the costume before wearing it and added a slip so that it wouldn't make me itchy. After my small changes, the costume felt more comfortable. Oh and the wings are a bit annoying, at first. I used crazy clue to make sure the straps stayed in place.<br />Because of all this I gave it 3 starts, but the look of it is 5.
B0112WAGL2|2|Much too small for a shirt listed as Large, but gave it to my daughter who actually wears a small and she is very happy!
B00OTT7C4U|5|Want more colors!
B00QSKYKL6|5|Great quality shirt - not like most of the ones you see now days that are made out of cheap material.
B0018OFK2U|5|none
B00R8HEKPO|5|Fits as expected
B008TNNLUG|5|This was the hit of the hippie party we went to. We added some black mascara to the beard and mustache my husband already sported to match the wig.
B00ALG1C6Y|5|Went well for the occasion intended.  Beautiful color and because I love large purses, it was the perfect size and fit.
B00TJ59MNS|5|Nicee dope shirt👌💯
B004WE4P10|5|This brand is a no fail, superior product. I will look no where except Cherokee for my work wear!! Thxs
B00ZJ801AW|1|Wasn't for me. I sent it back. It was cheap material and poorly made. It fit horrible.
B004XV2K9Q|5|I've recently picked up a good amount of these and I have to say, these are among my favorites. The waistband is stylish without being over the top and it looks good as a contrast against the black rayon. Excellent fit and finish on these, quality is top notch and they fit the goods like a glove. Definitely worth adding to the collection if you're into A.C.'s Almost Naked line.
B00N3LDEHE|2|Worthless...just gloves... That's all.  Forget about touchscreen capability... It's just not very effective.
B00KGGYIVU|4|Kinda big
B00AUHXWVW|5|Love it and the colors. Thought it was going to be small but fits perfectly! Especially with my tig ol bitties lol
B001TB8RHM|5|the guitar t-shirt arrived on time and was a big hit as a Christmas gift for my brother in law who loves guitars.  True to size, nice cotton and graphics!
B00LCFLBH8|5|these pants are great with tunics. smooth, gently shape hugging, seems to smooth out the bulges! love that!
B00THE516S|5|Great socks
B00EMG3U7S|4|You never know the size of your future baby...<br />My baby was large! and the bodies only fit him one week...<br />Good quality and nice print!
B00GBI5MA8|5|Top fits great and is excellent quality.
B005DJ8EHO|3|More of a 0-3 months, NOT true too size--definitely runs small granddaughter was 4 months old & this was very tight.
B001WPCOQA|5|I was looking for socks for my daughter to wear during soccer practices.  She loves them!  The socks are good quality.
B00BJ9AYM0|5|Fit as expected, looks very cute and i love the details in it.<br />Color is great too. I really love it
B009V0YXEO|3|This is a very pretty handkerchief  but I was disappointed that it is very thin. Looks exactly like a sheer curtain panel. You can see behind it. Definitely not a blow your nose and I personally would not use to to dry my eyes but I can see some would.
B002LK7A5K|2|This is one of those items that just looks really cool if you're a Misfits fan, until you put it on. The fit is all wrong, and there's not enough room at the top of the mast to fit a normal-sized head. Also, to echo another review, the fact that there's a nose hole doesn't make a whole lot of sense, especially since your nose (or at least my nose) will actually poke through it. All-in-all, this is a great idea done horribly wrong and will be a disappointment to those Fiend Club members who fork over the cash for it. Me, I just gave it to the kids to play with.
B00I2TKXU8|3|Bought this for a birthday gift and it did not fit her!!  It was too late to return it so it's in her drawer and not being worn...ah too bad it's a cool shirt.
B00AWL4KNU|4|Fun to wear.  However, I found the fit to be a little bit too big in the cup. I probably should have ordered the next smaller size.
B008238R0C|5|Cute skirt!
B007BZ5V2O|5|I bought my T for layering and it fits really well; not tight and and baggy or saggy to spoil the layers. I needed the shirt to be cool as well and it is. It seems a good product at an affordable price.
B00LHZF3EA|3|Nice wool coat with nice detailing, unfortunately runs much smaller in sizing then other brands.
B00CZ7VOSS|5|Fits perfectly very comfortable
B005EJGUE2|5|Great jeans for a great price. Being just over 5'1, it is hard for me to find jeans the right length, especially since many brands do not make petites. But the ankle length is perfect, for a regular length fit. Also, the jeans really do hold their shape and I usually don't need a belt, whereas most jeans I do. Definately recommend these!
B00L2PNDHE|5|Cute dress and fits perfectly!
B00EE1FFTM|1|Very large polka dots, NOT hearts. They're way to big (not a small-medium). They were supposed to be hearts.  I wouldn't purchase again
B00HLRNQ74|3|The color is great and all the different pockets but the material is cheap.
B008R4HNJ2|5|Cape is a bit much, but the shirt rocks!
B005SW6JKU|5|I have never worn Dickies before but had heard of their durability and quality; since these were one pair of very few I could find that wasn't either a bermuda/granny lengthy or an up-your-booty length, I took the risk.<br /><br />I have a 37 hip and 26 waist - the size 4 fits well and as expected, before and after washing (there was some shrinkage, but it was minimal). The drawstring is functional (not just decorative), so if you have trouble with &#34;gapping&#34; in the back waist, these will cinch up for you. However, I found that they fit nicely even without having to use the drawstring too much.<br /><br />The length is on the longer side of what I as a 26-yo would normally wear, but the shorts are still cute. Recommended!
B00RHWCONU|1|Material of this bra is very cheap. It smelled weird when received and on the first wash it looked like i had for years full on lint. The clips of the bra works very well, but I would be embarrassed to have anyone see me in it.
B00KMQ41YS|5|I absolutely LOVE this dress!! I usually wear a size 10-12 however I have a big chest (34DD) and have a hard time finding clothes to fit. So I ordered a large after reading reviews. It fits great! The slit is perfect right around the back on my knees (Im 5&#34;4) so my behind is not out lol. There were a few strings hanging off but I just cut them. My dress was a hit at my friends wedding! Took a chance and love it!
B00CMC7X4K|5|Thank you
B00RG2ACHQ|5|Great
B00901MLNO|5|I ordered a small and the package wrap was labeled a large. It fits great and is so flattering! It is a bit translucent so I would recommend wearing a nude bra or slip. It came quickly too for the estimated shipping time.
B005HEOXVQ|4|real, but full price
B0033PRG9M|4|Love the Hat!! Very happy with the purchase. Took 1 year to find a great one that was good for the beach.
B00OTTQZ5W|5|great, fabric feels very cool
B00B6E9FLO|4|Skinny as expected, no surprise order. Description merge what's received.
B00CBEYYM8|5|if you are just big (overweight) it will be too long and look like a camo dress for a chick.  That is how my husband is and that is how it looked on him.  Must be big and TALL to wear the XL sizes
B00AQH35AE|5|Again great material, draw string in place, front and back pockets. I'm 5,6.5&#34; and the tall are a bit too long. But between the regular and the tall - I'll take the tall!
B00EOHZ6YU|4|This coverall is sized appropriately, well made, and very cute.  The fabric is quite soft and of medium weight.  The color is more coral than pink but it's a pretty color.
B007VV4QYM|4|It replaced my wife old one....hers was a bit heaver, but she is very satified...a good buy for the money.
B00A433T5Q|5|I live in a rather cold area and when the weather dropped below 0 recently it did keep me rather warm. It's not like abominable snowman fur thick, but thick enough to not be freezing or sweating. It did smell a little strange but the smell went away after a few days without even washing it. I really like the length of it as well.
B00C3GU7DO|5|fit great and looked good I'm very satisfied,Great seller! Fast shipping.<br />Great price and Quality product.Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again
B0045WEMMQ|5|I ordered two of these skirts in small and they fit just fine. I love the fact that they're stretch because I'm currently a size 5 but I plan on going down to a size 4. And I will still be able to fit them if I stay this size or not. Very pleased with my order!!!
B006JYG5TQ|5|Had the right amount of insulation and was more than essential during our trip to new york during the New Year.
B0002TOZ1E|5|Very comfy. These just rock. Most comfortable ones i've ever had!
B00BF0MAXO|1|Not sized properly.
B00I1AJC6O|5|The lemonade and antique white is way more of a pink than red. I am keeping it though because it fits great and is a higher quality than another similar one I have.
B009DSSB7Y|4|I love the shirt, some of the words look a bit distressed, but I believe that is the design. Can't try it on my son because he's not here yet ;) Can't wait to though!
B009205QVM|5|She loved it!
B001U8PG96|5|These gloves are the best for protecting hands and arms - to the elbow.  Materials are heavy enough to keep really nasty palm needles and thorns from puncturing through yet pliable enough for comfortable working.  Bought for my hubby and he said the only thing wrong was that we didn't get them sooner!!  Thanks for a great product - very much worth the price.
B00J5VOP3I|2|fabric quality isnt so good.. it fits good, but the only thing i didnt liked is the quality
B000JHQBTI|4|I needed this shirt as a backup for work at Yellowstone National Park.  It was the right color and style and it dried overnight without ironing. I have added it to my regular wardrobe - nice shirt!
B00AKSC6UE|5|Excellent deal!
B003JTI0OM|3|I love these tights, but a huge hole opened up in the heel the second time I wore them. This is sadly the usual for Hue tights, and I hate it because I love the fit(!). Four out of five pairs will develop big holes within the first four or five times wearing them.<br /><br />But if you get a pair that stays intact, they are great tights.
B00C51623G|3|Love it, good quality, length is good but runs really small - unless you like a very fitted tee.
B00BL74OFI|5|Glad I read the reviews-they helped me get the right size for my boys. Perfect fit! And they LOVE them! I bought the Ninja for my 7 yr old (very skinny) and the checker pattern for my 9 yr old (who is very petite for his age). Both boys got a size medium, and they both were able to wear them comfortably for Halloween...and both had a t shirt and shorts underneath because it was cold! They shipped very quickly too, I would recommend these.
B009FV86RO|3|The first shirt I got came in the mail with a black stain on the back shoulder. I contacted the seller and they told me to just keep it and they would send me out a new one... which they did. So.. that I really appreciate. They were prompt with sending me out a replacement.<br /><br />However... even though that part was nice... when I got the shirt and tried it on I couldn't believe how tight it is in the HIPS. It's strange. It's like its fine everywhere else.. the arms... the neck.. but the hips are unbelievable tight. And I look at other reviews that say the same thing. It must just be how this shirt is made. Other than that... a nice shirt.
B003IC15MO|4|The price is right for this hat. My concern was the hat being once size fits all would not fit my larger than normal dome. The hat fit nicely and the band stretches a little, so there is nice flexibility with the size range. I am happy with the fit. The brim of the hat has an adjustable wire running toward the outside, so you can bend it to fit your visual taste. When it arrived it needed adjustment, but it was simple and looked great when I was done. The skull is a bit darker than the picture depicts. Not a problem, but worth noting. Overall I gave the product 4 stars. Would have been 5 starts but there was some shedding on the inside of the hat upon delivery that got on my head when I wore it the first time. Not a big deal, but I needed to blow the black debris (same material as hat) out before wearing it again. Very happy with the product.
B00404WNXO|5|I ordered the adult small, and got what I expected. This is certainly a men's cut. But I hemmed the sleeves in and trimmed the bottom off the shirt, and its perfect :).
B00S5PA8FE|5|So pretty! The color is gorgeous, and the detail in the back is really nice. The quality of the dress is very good and it is very soft and comfortable.
B00DIGZA8A|4|The socks looks very tiny. I ordered size 13 and was shocked when I received these tiny socks. But, the looks is very deceiving, and these socks are stretchy and comfy. My husband likes it.<br />The price was good, too.
B003D29X4Q|3|nice
B00DDKN7ZO|5|Purchased this as a gift and he loves it. It looks good on him, the quality is good, and he says it is comfortable. If you have a tall guy to buy for this fits very well using the size chart provided.
B0065ECHEM|5|great fit love the pockets
B00D6C8BQ4|4|Very cute costume, I wasn't sure what was included or the fit, so I thought I'd elaborate;<br />Included:<br />-Jacket with a detachable ruffle strip<br />-Tank Top<br />-Shorts with the ruffles you see at the hips on the photo<br /><br />I am 6'0 and wear 18-24 depending on the store. I do not have hips, so the bustle from the ruffles on the shorts looks fantastic and gives me great shape. Absolutely love that. However, it's horribly wrinkled and due to the nature of cheap halloween costumes, I am not sure how to get it out without ruining the shorts. The jacket almost fits great. I need maybe 1 more inch across to wear it comfortably, and due to my extended height, the arms are a little too short. Overall, I love this thing. I will just suck it in, and when I figure out how to get the wrinkles out of the shorts, I'll be happy! Much cheaper option than getting a real outfit made at several hundred dollars.
B00BANTRIC|5|good
B005F9H572|5|Really nice socks, warm and fit well. Was concerned maybe would be too tight but glad I was wrong :-)
B00B1HILR0|5|Lovely!
B007MFWTJG|5|A great casual pant for every day wear and still maintain a neat appearance. Great garment for shopping and everyday errands.
B005DA530Y|4|finally a shelf bra camisole that isn't too tight in the bust or the arms, and loose around the torso.  This one is perfect on top, but a bit too loose around the waist.  No problem, it can be taken in a bit.  Much better than others I've tried.
B006V766JA|5|I want a pair in all the colors available! Fit well. I also bought a black halter top to go with them
B0070CPFXS|5|Very pleased with purchase!
B0087C5P1M|5|I like the color and fit.The large cargo pockets are very handy. Anyone with back problems, because of sitting on a large bulky wallet,can be helped with these pants.It may not cure the problem,but the use of the cargo pockets might help.
B00IPDFCA2|5|Gorgeous swimsuit. Just like the picture and the jeweled bra is stunning. Order a size larger because it runs small.
B00CH106EK|4|As most Carter clothes, this runs a little small in the pants, don't seem to be very roomy, but love the outfit, and looks cute on. Would suggest going up a size for longer wear.
B00IGVAZHS|4|sexy sexy!!
B00N3RBS0S|4|cute! little bigger than expected for a 2T but great because you always want a larger fit for them to grow into. its soft and the print of dinosaurs is a little bigger than shown on the robe.love the product! thanks
B00BYUWZCQ|5|Grand son love it. Wears it as much as possible.
B006FYW6YI|5|Product was as described and works great!
B00SGV6UEK|4|Fit as expected. Quick delivery.
B00LLIVQL2|5|This product was just what I was  looking for. Great material it is at great price point other companies want much more for the same product. You will not be disappointed I will be ordering again when I need another size.
B00GI6X4B2|2|Can somebody give me the web or # for customer service i bought this dress and didn't fit i want to know if its possible to return it
B00ATM8MCW|4|Nice good price
B00LKW2RQC|5|fine
B00JAFEPKC|5|Great hat, love it.
B00JF0JMRS|5|Awesome thanks!
B00CC6ZKZ0|5|Baby is due in 5 weeks.  Material is nice and soft  and looks as advertised !!! Big hit at the shower!!!  Workmanship is great!!!
B00PBZR0T8|3|I had to return it as it was too plus for me. I did love the style and the neckline. Fabric was ok not sure what it was made of but it would be a wonderful LBD for many occasions.
B00X2J11TU|5|Love it 😍
B00MRB4W18|5|it goes awesome with my Rat Fink tattoo! I'm 5'8&#34; and an F cup and the XXL fit snug with plenty of wiggle room and length so I wasn't having to constantly check myself. Very comfy and sexy all in one! It's kind of a &#34;costumey&#34; material but I didn't find it too weak or itchy personally, and it came almost a week early!! I am very, very pleased and will be ordering more of this dress in different patterns!
B002UD64V4|3|I bought this dress for a \\"casual-dressy\\" occasion and was generally pleased.  The dress looks great without the jacket---add pumps and you have a very retro look which is in fashion right now.  With the jacket, it's casual enough to wear with flats.<br /><br />As for sizing, I would say it runs a little small.  There is no 'give' to the fabric at all, so it has to be big enough to zip comfortably (it's an invisible nylon zipper, so forcing it will no doubt cause it to break). I returned my original order and got the next size up even though it's not commonly what would fit me in the department stores.<br /><br />Not sure if the price point is just right for the item, though---at $79 it seems a little high.  Overall I'll be fine with the price if it turns out that I can wear this enough to make it worth it!
B00J3WM4BO|3|Very cute & comfortable. . A bit chilly now that it's getting cooler, but comfortable!
B00BTWWD30|5|Well made and they fit great!. Very fun, quirky, & stylish.
B0098W8FYY|4|Very nice. Normally I wear tshirts to work that arent fitted at all but they're making us do polos so its gonna be weird to get used to. My fiance suggested I get a bigger size (its not even tight).<br />I love the buttons. Im 5'3 and 130lbs. Its sort of short but doesnt show skin. A size up may be a good idea if you dont like to wear belts or tuck in your shirt
B00GN8K16Q|5|Flattering, comfortable and great support.  Have worn this style for years:  very durable!
B000UJZDDU|4|The product was brand new, and just as specified. However, during this time period (I was buying several items for a trip I was planning) my card number was stolen and used for purchases I did not make. I am not saying this is the seller that committed this fraud, I'm just putting a warning out there.
B00HVUQCAE|4|Thank you, i like it
B008VT4OYA|4|This shirt looks great. The colors are different than your average polo, and the Penguin is always a plus.<br />Looks great with jeans, or chinos. The only thing I can say is that XL with Penguin is more about length than anything.
B00TH23NXS|5|Love it, fits perfect will buy others!
B00UVYS84K|2|The top was way too big and the bottoms were way too small. I wish you could order different sizes of each
B0007CKIPS|5|Fit as expected
B006Z8HWAC|5|My husband refuses to buy clothes, so when I could see through the fibers of his sweats, I decided to purchase him some new ones.  The tag was still intact on his old pair (which were pre-ME, 16 years) so Jerzee's really hold up well.  This pair ran a little big, but we love them.  Burned the old pairs. Thank you.
B00KS45O72|5|Loved it very much, it was so soft and worm and stylish I looked amazing wearing it thank you Ted Baker
B001BLLQMI|4|I bought 4 of these - for myself, my husband, and each of our 2 children, and they were perfect for our trip to Disney World.  Although a little bit big for the kids (ages 9 and 11), these wonderful lumbar packs had more than enough room to carry everything we needed for a day at an amusement park.  We were able to carry water, snacks, wallets, cameras, and still had extra room.  We lost one of the water bottles on a ride, so we put a regular 500 ml water bottle in the mesh holder and it fit fine.  The packs were versatile - sometimes I wore mine in the back, sometimes in the front, and sometimes I carried it over my shoulder (though not with the water bottles full).  I can't wait to try it out hiking and biking!  Overall, a great lumbar pack for the price!
B0018Q6B3U|5|The Levi's 560 jeans are the most comfortable jeans. They are loose in the areas that need to be, and tapered at the bottom of the legs for a nice look.
B00WH30N2I|1|These things come in 10 sizes too small
B00L1PMQM8|4|it is very very comfortable
B00W66VDGQ|5|Great fit at a fantastic price.
B00511SXJS|4|These jeans are a great fit for me, and I have received several compliments when I wear them. The only negative is that the front pockets are very small. I carry my cell phone in my pocket, and there is barely room for it to fit. I find myself struggling to get the phone out when it rings. If the pockets were deeper, as are those in my other jeans, I would have given these jeans a five star rating.
B00OA45CUK|5|Love this so much. I wrote where bottoms were so read that and you can tell how happy I am!!
B009MIMWY8|5|Love it, fit perfectly
B00KW7R4KK|4|While I prefer button up jeans these will work!
B00Y5VF9MY|5|I love these gloves. They are very comfortable and light weight for the summer.
B006PGGJOE|4|Great for holding credit card sized objects.  I would give 5 stars if cash would fit better.  Would still purchase again.
B003DHVZJ2|5|A little thinner than I had hoped, but adorable and a win with the hubby.  Washes well and looks great on.
B000N8Q2P6|5|I usually buy blue jeans when I have to. The ones I have had lately don't fit anymore and are tearing up. I will wear jeans until they tear up to the point that they can't be work in public anymore.<br /><br />These jeans seem rugged and sturdy. I think I'll be wearing these for several years to come.
B000V6X6I6|1|This was a waste of money because I didnt ear it and so was the outfit that is sized 3X/4X and fits a person XL.
B006WCUN3O|5|Great outfit and is true to size. Can't go wrong with snoopy, he's a classic. Washes nicely and wears well.
B000UZ5VVI|5|I had been looking for a wallet exactly of this kind. It has good leather and many compartments. Good for my use. It also has zipper compartment which helps in keeping coins. With this price its the best I can get. I ordered similar one for my sister also.
B0024YVG5S|5|The few people who complained about the size of slots or how money fit must have not researched what they were buying. This was my introduction to this companies products and I am SOLD. The quality is amazing the attention to detail is top notch and it is perfect for slimming down to the essentials of life.  I'll keep my Coach wallet in my car for all the additional cards I feel I have to have but keep this on me at all times.  The cards fit and if you squeeze the sides gently the center opens allowing for placement of cash (I am a money clip guy so I only kept big bills in my wallet anyway).  I was tired of my back hurting from sitting on my wallet. I'm not a front pocket wallet guy and this is like nothing is in my back pocket. If you want to complain about the price remember that you get what you pay for and once it is in your hand you will not care the cost!  I am already making a shopping list of needs from SBL and will be ordering another of these for a Xmas present. Yes the fit is tight but go to the essentials for a few days then add a card or two if need be. It will stretch but not shrink so customize it to what you need day to day and you will wonder why you carried all that junk around for so many years.
B00MH6SL10|5|Love this shirt, it's one of my favorite, I bought 2 of them.
B008OVN0ZE|4|These tights are super cute! Great pattern. They do however run a little bit too small. I'm a small and the small/medium were a little snug in the crouch.
B003IBV71E|5|My adult  son who is autistic wore it to 3 holloween parties.. He was really happy about it.  When he was leaving All the  gang said :<br /><br />  Good by &#34; Charie brown &#34;  Thanks<br /><br />  ..Gary  Roanoke Va...
B00401R9N6|3|Very thing is good thank
B0054TC3PM|1|Just received this costume and was kind of shocked at how paper thin and cheaply made it is. I guess you get what you pay for. It looks a whole lot nicer in the picture then what it actually is!
B00DX7T2KG|5|I love this jacket! The price was a steal ! Thanks!! I will wear this for a long time come
B00ELUV61C|2|This sweater is pretty big, which is to be expected, but there needs to be another shirt underneath. I would wear one anyway, but the slits up the side come up pretty high. Also, the off-the-shoulder look the model has in the image doesn't work as well as I thought. It's pretty grandma-ish.
B0076R6KY0|5|Was bought for my 12yr.old son I got the black size small he's 4&#34;9 109 pds...it fits perfect....shipping was excellent and he finally liked something I picked out....what a surprise.....he thanked me...i would definitely recommend
B000IZCESS|5|It's great but, when I ordered my size, it was a little bigger. The material and design is awesome though.
B00MNCDRNK|4|came really fast and fits great
B00JK6SC50|5|My grandkid love hello kitty ,and good jacket when it is cool outside.
B00NEJAGFI|4|Nice quality and true to size.
B00EYXEYUQ|5|Was looking for a Minecraft shirt that was not the same ones found in the stores. Very cute!  Kids love it!  Good quality T-shirt.
B00APYRR4I|5|These pants arrived on time, just what I ordered, right size and I am very pleased with them.  Color is good and the price was right.
B002FU62QO|5|excellent product, very warm and soft, fits perfectly,looks great. It just too long, but first washing and drying fixed it. Very good for cold and windy weather.
B00NOFLB88|1|It is VERY SMALL
B00K47YY88|5|Beautiful I love it.
B0087678RW|1|The pantyhose I received were true to size and color- but the design was nothing like the one pictured. The pair I received had a few random flowers on the side and a little in the back, but purely fishnet on the entire front. I did not try them on until the night of my event and had no back up pair so had to wear them. Very disappointed.
B009PJV6KK|5|So real, excite!
B00EKIYL3A|3|The zipper was bad, due to the good reviews I'll return it and try this one again
B00HCC0XVA|4|I ordered a size up as advised and my daughter only keeps these up because the legs are so fitted. The waste band hovers around her body like a halo. I love the feel of these pants for her and since they don't fall down due to the super stretchy fabric on her legs they're keepers. They'll fit her for years I'd imagine.
B00MNRVB4M|5|Better looking in person, very comfy
B0063ASHSS|5|This dress is beyond beautiful and was one of the greatest gifts I could've ever stumbled upon. My sister's wedding was 11-14-14, and it seemed as though I'd looked everywhere for a dress. I was the Maid of Honor, and I struggled to find something in the right color that I loved which also flattered me. I checked online, in-store, thrifted, and even Amazon.com.. or at least I thought! With less than a month left until the wedding, I thought to check Amazon one more time. Low and behold... I stumbled upon this beauty, in the right color (around the wine/cranberry family), in my size, and it was Amazon PRIME... which would come in 2 days! Life-saver! The fit was lovely, the bottom flowed beautifully as I walked down the aisle, and the jewels on the shoulder were a perfect touch! The only slight-issue I had was the V-neck cut was a little low for my personal liking and some might have considered it a tad inappropriate for the wedding... but my sister's new soon-to-be mother-in-law sewed it up a bit and voila! I would highly recommend this outstanding dress for any special occasion. I would also like to send a HUGE thank-you to &#34;Ever Pretty&#34;! I found the perfect M.O.H dress for me that I fell in love with, and my sister was more than pleased! She cried tears of joy! We are so grateful...
B005EFOIDQ|5|An astonishingly good product for the price. Good fit and quality material. I'd certainly buy more when the need arises.
B003K1CSFQ|5|just gorgeous
B0029EBNI8|5|Fits great.  High quality.
B00E8IKIWK|5|High quality and comfortable.
B00IZE24J8|5|I love this dress!
B007D1PD9M|5|Got this as a gift for Christmas for my 2 year old son and it fits really well. Now of course I can never get him to keep it on his head. The quality is really impressive. It has a very soft feel to it and the fit is spot on. This is a great gift for any Star War fan... my cousin was jealous they didn't make it in Adult size.
B00KQIRI4W|5|Nice fit and exactly as described.
B00LU55WC0|3|Order size up
B0073MLZ70|5|This wallet has slots for everything, is a bifold with the feel of a trifold.
B00630KYZM|4|they are ok
B001CWM756|4|It was good, definitely need to have the petty coat under it. also the straps on the shoulders don't like to stay up. I had to leave them down. But I still loved it. I also had to wear a corset underneath because the outfit is not cinching.
B000S3UW8Y|5|This is a great product for its price. The fabric is even nice, and the letters don't come off in the wash.
B00GUFHF9S|5|exelente
B006X2573O|4|Good quality and enjoy them a lot. Very comfortable.<br /><br />It did take a long time to get them and the tracking information and process was lagging behind the actual delivery.
B009DNWH2O|1|You can't see it in the picture, but there are panels sewn into the leggings so that there are unsightly bulges when you put them on.  I'm sad to say that I had to send them back.  Too bad because they were priced reasonably.
B0063LWCVA|5|gave these as a gift for christmas. They are soooo soft. True to size. I bit short waisted but nothing too noticable. great deal!
B001IAWVEO|5|See my review of &#34;Designer Mens Suit 2-button&#34; for my story. Bottom line, these inexpensive suits are well cut, sewn well and fit very nicely.  I recommend these suits for light use (I live in Arizona, the goal is to get the coat off ASAP, and all in black, at that!), and if I can keep the waist line down, these suits should last me years.
B00DF1P5HY|2|The fabric was poor quality and wrinkled and hung in an unflattering way.  I returned it.  It looked much cuter on the model.
B005O7J76W|5|friggen adorable. too big for a newborn but just clip it to size...no biggie. worth the money.
B00B5TSK70|5|Bought this for my husband for xmas and he loved it!!! It came early thanks!!
B001TXO66G|3|The hat itself is fine , but it arrived with a completely different hat band to the one shown.  It was also a size too large.  Overall, not very impressive.
B00EAXTFQ8|5|Nice dress.  I have several.  Wonderfully cool in summer.
B00IW03NV8|5|Love these pins of course don't expect to look like the model lol they are so silky soft and cute! I'm defiantly gonna get more when I can! Love them super cute and sophisticated all in a cute on gown for bed! Xoxox
B008PDC1MO|4|These pajamas are very comfortable.  The fabric is very soft, but a little thinner than I expected.  I wanted to replace my velour pajamas which were too big. The length of the sleeves and legs are just right.  I am 5'5&#34; tall and I ordered a small.  The color is a watermelon red rather than the cherry red shown.
B005CSNVN8|5|They are a little snugger than I expected but medium would not have worked.  Just gotta stay on the diet.
B0028K33L8|5|I haven't figured out the Derek Rose line of PJ's yet.  I mean It all started this one pair (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055NFXHM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  This set  was so solid and thick and well constructed with piping and the works.  All it said was 100% cotton?  So I tried another 100% cotton and they were just flimsy and didn't feel at all like the first pair.<br /><br />Now for this pair.  OUTSTANDING!  Like my first, they are well constructed, elegant, feel great and look better.  I love them I'm a Danny DeVito body (though Im 5'9&#34;)  type so XL fit perfectly and they weren't too long!!<br /><br />I love them.
B00KRECXX6|1|It was made of inferior quality fabric and looked as if it had been already worn
B00HYRI8G0|3|The shirt is ok nice fabric and all, the jersey however feels a bit too light and the Jeans are way smaller than those for a 2 year old!!The outfit looks good for the little man but i think its overpriced for the quality!!
B009V7A8QY|5|It was such a nice outfit and the price was reasonable.  My grandson looked so cute.
B00VWXQMJ2|4|The shirt is very  nice & I got it very fast seeing where it was coming for. Overall satisfied!
B00RY54NMK|1|This print of this dressd is gorgeous but it runs on the large side. I ordered a large and I have to give it Away.
B003IFY78A|5|Everyone adores them. I'm glad I bought them. I ripped one pair when I face planted so be careful.
B008PUO4RC|4|Es un jeans que se ajusta bien a mi cuerpo esta bien de altura  porque soy una persona talla alta el color es el correcto lo recomiendo que lo adquieran 100%
B00KDCBN56|5|This thing is so perfect. It shipped fast it fits wonderfully and i like how theres strings so i can adjust it; i will not have to buy another one ever. Its wonderful and saves alot of money.
B00IHQNDWG|5|Just what I was looking for and it fits perfectly.
B00EXJCDFY|3|Side panel material is thinner than the rest and so not as nice looking.  And the side panel material does not provide enough support.  Tummy panel does not provide enough supoort either.  I am 5'5&#34; and 123#.  The length of the torso is right.  The eye and hook gusset is convenient.  I saw one design with a slit in the gusset ... really?  The cup size fits well for 34C.
B008FVQQHM|5|Nothing bad about this at all, loved it, great quality, decent shipping time, and great customer service. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great skinny tie.
B00KBA2BY2|5|It was the perfect fit and quality product.
B000PC0TWM|4|As far as quality goes, this is an excellent buy!  It runs very large.  I thought plus size was a 14..it is actually more like an 18-20..had to take it in.
B000VK2LB0|5|I had purchased these bras at a local retail store and have never been able to find them again, I went on line to the manufacturer and the site actually read you can purchase online at Amazon..I was so please.<br />These Bras are THE BEST Ever !!<br />I ordered two at first, because the seller had a limit per order, and then later went back later and ordered another, I would have ordered all of the four available but someone beat me to it and purchased the thing .. so I have 2 and the third is in transit. I could never say enough about these bras,  the underwire is comfortable and the more you wear them and I hand wash them and air dry, the more comfortable they get. The underwire underneath the arm pit area is a little annoying at first but after a few washes it 's fine..Absolutely No complaints about these bras, just waiting on the third one purchased :)
B00EHCM8KM|5|The corset is perfect. It ties with ribbons above your neck. The lace in back is also a ribbon. It is covered in silky fabric, including a regular purple and a slightly more berry-like shade of purple for the stripes. See photo.
B001507ZBG|5|I wear this blouse as part of my work uniform I'm required to wear. It washes easily, looks great and has served its purpose very well.  The shipping was super fast.    I'll be buying more!
B003QHZ79I|4|I was excited that the costume came with all the accessories, but it was cheap quality. However, it served its purpose and in all I am happy with my purchase.
B007OX5FZQ|5|great item fo the price, than you.
B00CWWP3K6|5|Definitely not disappointed. The shape and size is perfect for my little ones coming to see me for photos. :) Thanks!
B0048KUEK4|1|I've had this bra for a couple of months and already the wire has poked through and it rubs under my arms. Terrible product. Already had to buy a new black bra from another company. WASTE OF MONEY.
B00FUHWT5C|3|smaller than expected
B000ELQMK2|5|I love this apron. Always gets a laugh, albeit a nervous one! Durable and handy to have in the kitchen. Stands up to washing and hasn't stained yet.
B006SRTDH0|5|Great thermals but could use a little more room in the &#34;caboose' area. Otherwise warm and scratchless.
B00KHJRVNI|4|This is a pretty piece for it's low price but it did look like one of the bits was sewn on inside out as the seam was showing. It's no biggie-- it's still beautiful and my boyfriend certainly loves it. :) 5'1, 130lbs 34B I got the medium fits great. Thanks!
B003E6ZOOY|5|I am in love with this bra.  The fit is perfect. Makes the bust look fabulous and the underwear is fine. Which they had things so I would have an option.
B0050AFYNS|4|I absolutely love it! They are very very comfortable, nice texture. Your manhood and ass would love fitting in those. They are a little bigger than I expected, so buy 1 size smaller than you actually wear.
B00K74ZMTS|4|I've only worn it once so I can't talk about durability/longevity but the material is thicker and nicer than I expected. The sleeves, like most of these Asian-sizing shirts are EXTREMELY tight and short, similar to doublju and h2h brands.
B001HQJA2A|5|I guess a rating of what is equal to an XL vs 2XL... I ordered incorrectly the first time.<br />Got the replacement and it fits fine.
B00UF7YL9E|5|Beautiful shirt - it saddened me that it was too small for me.
B0028PBENC|5|I bought these as gifts for business associates. Very pleased. Definitely met my expectations.
B00BGVDS6K|3|Too small THO I figured the size i ordered would be fine. Product and service good just too small
B0009MZV94|5|Great socks! I have a shoe size 6.5 and the mediums are perfect for my feet. They are warm and soft too.
B00E7W1AKQ|2|Received with a broken zipper.  Was unable to return because it was over 48 hrs from recpt. when actually taken out of the package and looked at.  This is a really poor policy.  Very disappointed.
B005EME72G|5|These are super cute and comfortable! I love wearing them with a tunic. They do run a but long but I have still purchased over 10 leggingsqueen brand leggings on amazon.
B0033UMWC8|3|Don't like the material...not flattering at all. The design on the other hand is great. When it came it had an awful smell to it though. I have washed it twice now and it is still VERY strong. It's rather disgusting! I hope I can get it out of it, but i'm not too sure just yet. VERY FAST shipping. Shipped in 2 days with free super saver shipping. I would buy this again....given I can rid it of this odd smell.
B004XVXIFG|4|These were purchased for a 3 month old. They were a bit tight in the waist. They don't have a super stretchy waist elastic like other baby pants you buy and I wish they did. The elastic is really thin and that makes waistbands not as comfortable.<br /><br />The fabric was perfect for me. Very thin! I didn't need a bulky, super warm pant but if you do don't buy these. They're lightweight! Which as I said was just what I was looking for for springtime.<br /><br />The colors are pretty true to the photos. I have three pairs of these, the light green, the purple, and the brown. The brown in the photo is darker than they are in real life. The green and purple look like the exact color.
B00V9VRMO6|5|Light flowey fabric - so comfy! Make sure you don't just pick your size USE THE SIZE CHART!!
B00E1CGSY0|5|Huge hit with my wife
B0094Y1CBE|3|Too big. Lovely hat but closure is awkwardly positioned and not adjustable. Little disappointed. She doesn't wear it often because of this. Too bad
B000Q8H284|5|Excellent product.
B00DNT98YE|2|The tie was fine.  The color was off.  Expected more of an aqua to match a dress, but when it arrived it was a light blue.  Definitely not the color showing up on the screen.
B00LW2OV3C|5|Although it runs a bit small, it is great quality, soft and is adorable on!  I am very pleased with this purchase!
B003M2YRK2|5|Love these jeans!!!!
B00LENAJIK|4|Very cute, fits as expected.
B00SRSLRXG|5|Very nice casual top.  Just the length I wanted to wear with skinny jeans, leggings and boots.  Ordered the large when usually order medium because I wanted it bigger and a little longer.  Nice green, cute and comfortable.
B0095NQHAA|3|This is a very nice and very soft blanket.  However the trim started ripping off very quickly.  Not very good quality.
B00FDSTMD0|5|Nice.
B00EPKKLIM|5|I got the fox color. Good quality faux fur. Wish it was a little longer, but I knew this before ordering from reading other reviews.  Looks great on my jackets and is very warm. Highly recommended
B00MRPSWVA|2|Understandably upon opening the package, the top was extremely wrinkly. This causes the material to feel quite a bit like crepe paper and very rough. After ironing the material was much softer - chiffon-like.<br /><br />I tried it on and was disappointed because it was very large, but still looked cute so I was on the fence whether to keep it or send it back. I folded it and set it on the package for a few minutes, decided to look at it again, and it was already wrinkled. I seriously dislike clothing that wrinkles too easily, and this would definitely have wrinkles in the front and back after a couple moment sitting down so I sent it back.<br /><br />The color was very pretty, but it just wouldn't work for me. Definitely buy it true to size if not a size smaller than you normally wear. There is a lot of excess material for the drape and with a size small (I'm a small or medium in women's sizes), it billowed around me a bit more than I like.
B006PGGJOE|3|I had other wallets like this one, although it is good, the edges are rough
B00A76MNHU|1|the item in the picture is nothing like what I received in the mail...I will not recommend anybody to purchase this product or from allegra again. I will be returning my item and await a refund. this is unacceptable. the colour is not the same the material is very flimsy and there is no tags on the blazer to indicate size, washing/ironing instructions, not even the material type.
B00DEXLHDO|5|These are the most comfortable and best fit I've found anywhere.  I'm glad I got them, will get more, and definitely recommend them.
B011P8F6B8|5|I loved this bathing suit so much I odered another one in a different color! Beautiful color, looks exactly like the picture. Fits great I'm normally a size large but I went 2 sizes up because most swimsuits run small I got an XXL. The suit fits perfect!!! Can't wait to wear it on vacation
B00LCQXQRA|5|I love this belt!
B0023TT22I|5|men's scrubs in this color with the two front waist pockets is just what i needed. they feel great and carry my tools conveniently. no noticeable shrink post wash. i recommend.
B00FW7K4T8|5|It's tight, but that's kinda the idea haha I started clasping the top hooks, skipped to the bottom, then went back and did the middle ones to get it on. You get pretty fast at putting it on after a few times of doing it and it really looks great! Definitely makes a difference during and after wearing it, but I didn't wear it long enough to see if there were long term results.
B00D5SVLNO|5|Great set
B00KV85USS|1|I just gave it to someone cause I'm bigger round and it didn't fit right
B002MAPG32|4|I bought this last winter and so far it has been the only peacoat style coat that has actually kept me warm in NJ winters. I always get compliments on it and the quality is great.
B00EUGDL9W|3|This dress was as expected look wise, but the bust was WAY too large.. now I have a smaller build being a 34, but there was no way to even button it shut-- just way too much extra fabric.
B00N3N5TJS|3|Im 5'7&#34; and 135lbs. Got an xtra large and it's still too small. Pushes all the breasts down to your stomach instead of doing the opposite.<br />Don't buy this!<br />Go to a store and try other ones on instead!
B004BW187W|5|Product fit well, it looked good, the material is good quality, I have worn the product for 2 weeks. Very happy.
B006PGGJOE|5|Had an issue with product at first, I called them and got new product within 7 days. Went on three week vacation and loved the ease of having my credit cards in one secure place. Slides easily into my purse. Now my husband wants one too.
B00LGW5IBW|5|Getting ready for a second year of the arctic blast in the Midwest.  Cuddl Duds are wonderful long underwear.  Thin enough to wear under office work clothes with a slippery outside finish (like a slip) so your outside clothes glide on nicely.  I pretty much live in these December through February, so I needed to stock up.  This style has a traditional high waist (good for mom pants).
B00MSOVIO8|1|Runs very small
B00C2XMPEM|5|Absolutely an excellent product, delivery was fast. this belt fits a tiny bit smaller that i expected my waist size is 32 so i got the 32 and wish i got the 34 for a little extra belt room. otherwise i love. bought a few other colors because its excellent quality.
B00TT3CAF2|3|Really cheaply made but it did what i needed for my costume.
B004FZY16A|1|Took over a month to receive. Arrived in what looked like a garbage bag with tape and no tags on hat. Pretty sure it is a fake. I even checked the NF brand website which says this hat is supposed to be 100% acrylic, this one is 100% polyester.
B00O3D165S|5|I lived in these during my hospital stay after giving birth. My shoe size is around 8-8.5 and they fit perfectly. They are a mix between a sock and a slipper. Very cute and comfortable. Easy to wash. I received a pink striped, blue striped, solid black, and solid blue pair.
B00N9ZI6TU|4|This pajama set is pretty and comfortable as well.  I only gave it 4 stars because it runs a little small.  If you like your pj's loose you might want to order a size up.
B00PCXAGC2|4|Great quality looks like picture, all stars and strips. Only reason didn't get 5 is because it didn't come with a fuzzy part for the Velcro only had one of the two needed but it was okay because I already had one but just to let others know.
B00ASHIYB2|5|This shirt has really nice drape, not boxy or awkward. I could see wearing it a lot in all seasons. The fabric gets a little staticky but it's real silk.
B00W62NS0O|4|The charm is a lot larger than I expected.  It seems sturdy.  The cloth is literally just a strip of cloth the edges are not sewn together.  But over all the scarf looks beautiful.  I would say it is very nice and I would buy again.
B0046MCQCI|5|I must say that, first, these boxer shorts are NOT made of real silk.<br /><br />Secondly, three of them tore at the seam in the crotch after three months.<br /><br />Lastly, they \\"rode up\\" during the day, so almost every night I had \\"wedgies\\".<br /><br />My advice is don't waste your money.
B00GO9LO6A|5|I have an 11 year old. He loves Minecraft and really loves this shirt. His gaming friends like the shirt and asked where he got it. Good quality T-Shirt. I would recommend it for a Minecraft Lover.
B00NRSJ8J6|3|Attractive but not great quality.  I am keeping the scarf because it is cute knowing that it will have a short life.
B00K5TBCNU|5|Good price. Good quality. Perfect for a long run.
B00COLS780|5|This is a gift for my husband, I know he's going to love it. Arrived very quickly.
B00JOMVZQ8|3|Fun shirt!
B00GWGGLPO|4|Originally I ordered this jacket to wear next fall, but it runs somewhat small, so order a size up to get the most use out of it!<br />My son wears size 12-18 months in most clothes and outerwear (he is 13 months, 22.5 lbs, 30&#34;), but I ordered it in 18-24 months and it fits perfectly. The fleece material is warm and soft, and the color is beautiful.
B008NCYBJ8|3|I ordered these leggings looking for something that I could wear without showing my underwear/skin through them. Although the material for these is nice and stretchy without being confining, it seems to be very thin and leaves clear pantilines.I'm 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs so I think if you're even a little bigger showing a lot of skin is going to be unavoidable with these.<br /><br />Pros: good stretch and comfy<br />cons: thin material
B00IYJQLJI|5|Perfect!!!
B00CNURPRQ|4|Tight across bust but would but again. Breathable  material
B00HESRHWU|5|Does the job, keeps my neck warm, durable and I don't have to worry about it snagging.
B00GA42KNA|5|This is just gorgeous. It will be beautiful at Christmas time to wear. It is so soft. I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. I know she is going to love it.
B00CYGURG0|5|Good quality shirt. The Daleks still look good even after a ton of washings. My husband is 5'4&#34; and 110 pounds. We ordered the Medium and it's not too big or too small for him.
B00B2FU8A4|5|Fits beautifully with a great feel of well-made clothing... and looks even more amazing than in the picture! Ordered for my teen and she loves it!
B00CI13DL2|4|grandson adored this
B004AGXPJS|5|no more cold head  fits great, looks great and no more cold ears!!! Based on other reviews that stated sizing might run a little small, I accounted for that and I bought an L/XL instead of SM/M and it fits great.
B00GRS9FMI|4|Looks great & fit great.
B00UU6J4WO|1|Only received a 6 pack pair of socks not 10 pack.
B00PR6ELAM|5|I love this shirt! All my coworkers wanted to know where I got it and it's so comfortable! Will definitely be purchasing more from them.
B00CPUSQPO|5|I wanted a fun, silly patriotic tank to show my love on the Fourth of July and I'm so glad I stumbled across this one. The girl tanks were all boring or too girly. I almost bought one of the \\"back to back World War champs\\" tanks (which are admittedly still hilariously awesome) but I know this one is different and not so many people will have it. Arrived fast with Amazon prime shipping and it looks great. The screen printing is really vibrant and it looks just like it does in the picture. I couldn't be happier with the symbols on the front. They really capture what 'MURICA is about. I don't think the neck is too loose but then again let's just say I don't have a problem filling the front of most shirts... Have a happy 4th of July fellow patriots! 'MERICA!
B00JGF96HS|5|I love it,  it's warm and soft
B0087COTEQ|2|I loved this book bag. I'm enrolled in college and high school with tons of books and laptop. Got it in July before school started and it was amazing. until in January the plastic things on the strap connecting it to the bag and where you change the length of strap snapped on both sides. I still use the backpack I just tied the straps together on both sides. Loved it but after the great reviews I read about it holding up well and then paying as much as I did for it I'm not to happy it broke.
B00PJ5NFX0|5|Can be worn as a smart or casual shirt..good fit too
B00CYUBHI8|5|Gave these as gifts.  I like them & you can get 2 or more cards in each sleeve.
B00NC03HDW|5|I love this coat. I'm completely satisfied.
B00MV340LE|5|Lovely dress will recommend it for buying.
B002WHY7QM|5|Very good quality, fitting well, 100% cotton tanks.<br />Great value for the price. My son feel comfortable in these tanks.<br />Recommended.
B007F2K5CY|5|much warmer than expected this is almost a jacket. Fuzzy inside is cozy and sleeves have more of a jacket feel that's much more comfortable than comparable products.
B00H8ANNMC|5|Fits perfect!
B00IY4NNK8|5|These are the best pants I ever ordered from China I love them👍👍
B0041EFHG8|5|love it's thanks
B00KDFZR82|4|runs big
B00HQZKTKS|4|Great product that changes with your breathing. The only downside is that the black areas were difficult to see through.
B00K6Y6WSO|5|I love this costume  it suited my needs to coincide with the frozen theme to match my daughter who was Elsa.
B008293YFE|1|Listen to the reviews. They are right! It runs really big, very unflattering. I hope I can return this because I'll have to spend more money taking it to a tailor to have s possible chance of using it!
B004V8XPGS|5|t'was a gift
B001EJBYJC|5|fit is good our  10 year old loves it he were's it all the time
B00DVLBSPG|5|I love this shirt! Being a plus size lady, it's alwys hard to find shirts that look nice, fit nice, are made well, and are long enough! This shirt fits the bill. Plus it's stylish and feminine. LOVE IT!!
B002X115DK|1|Waited for 3 weeks for this shirt...emailed seller 3 times...no response...Amazon did right in refunding my purchase but NEVER purchase from this seller!
B001JBGXQO|5|Same high quality I've come to expect from Fruit of the Loom
B00363VN1I|3|the sizing on this item runs large
B00L3MEP50|3|OK.  the gold is a little much, b ut they fit well and seem to work ok.
B002SLKN06|5|This robe is thick and soft. Just washed and dried to find the robe expand and fluff up and it is even thicker and softer. The quality is top notch. Great price as well. Will definitely recommend to others. Bought for my boys to have after swim class. I think they will be living In these robes during the whole winter!
B00CIB5GLW|3|The dresses are cute, however ,the flowers fell off the pins as soon as I took the dresses out of thw packaging.
B003V8AKM6|5|Got this as a gift for a son in law who is very Eco conscious and he loves it.
B000N5NKGI|5|My husband fishes bass tournaments every weekend.  Because he had been complaining about his neck and ears getting sunburned when wearing the \\"standard gear\\" baseball style cap, I searched the 'net and found this hat.  He wore it for yesterday's tournament and absolutely loves it.  The hat keeps the sun off and the mesh allows his head to stay cool.  He commented that it is not heavy on his head either.  Hopefully, he never tests the company's claim that the hat floats...
B00K12V0LU|5|good
B00422M6FE|5|Still using this wallet, no rips or tears yet!  I like to use the little card pouch mainly as it fits nicely into my pants pocket without the bulge!
B008LZLKPK|4|I like the quality of bag: it is heavy duty and well made. My house is kept cold at night (around 62 degrees) and it did the job keeping my baby (3 months old) warm by following the recommendation on how many layers to put on your baby for the night). The only reason I gave a 4 star is because there are snaps only on one shoulder and it makes it hard to put your baby in there without waking him up. I would have like to have snaps on both shoulders so it would be easy to put my baby in the bag at night. If your baby is a light sleeper, puting his arm in there is definitely going to wake him up. But besides that I love the bag and the fact that it will grow with my baby. It was expensive to buy but it will last a long time as it is pretty big. Honestly, I don't really see putting a newborn in there as it it big. Overall. I would recommend this sleep bag. I also ordered a lighter one for the summer (the cotton one) but haven't tried it yet.
B00W1JAV66|3|Cute dress - sizing is wayyy off what they say it is. It is more like kids sizing. Very disappointing due to waiting so long to receive it and then being way to small.
B001CO7TM0|5|Looks good and keeps your head warm.
B00LLVT6K2|4|Takes a while to get, but cute.
B00HLSRNO0|5|Used for our wedding! My husband is 64 and it worked perfect! Def worth the money. Didn't fall apart and we will use it again! The kid size works great too.
B003ITAFMS|5|Looks just like the kit I was issued in the service.
B0006U68BE|3|It was time to move up from 32&#34; waist to 33&#34;. Too bad the 33's fit the same as the 32's so I haven't moved up. I am very happy and surprised that these are available in a 33&#34; inseam. Maybe I don't get out enough but I haven't seen a 33&#34; inseam in decades.
B00K5MI9O2|3|Good looking jacket and very warm, but the fleece got a lot of little lint balls after the first wash
B01160QX9Y|5|I bought this even though it's for men, and it's SO soft!!!
B00FA7G2UA|5|My niece  loves it1
B00FO74LGS|1|The bottoms were too small and the top was very large.  I have the average hour glass shaped body. Very disappointing.
B0018T5AZ2|5|Bought this for my son as a gift and he loves it. True to size and good quality.  Not too thick and not too thing.  I washed it in cool water and air dried.  If it is stiff and little wrinkly from air drying, I throw it in the dryer with a clean bath towel on low heat for a few minutes so it won't shrink. The color did not bleed.  Highly recommend.
B00DM82P6O|3|Good quality,not meant for girls over 5'10&#34; Color was lighter than expected. The waist rides low. One size fits all???
B00FHM9KZW|4|A little shorter than I thought but is nice material
B0082IXSM4|5|I couldn't really see the image that well but ordered this shirt because I like S&S. I was not disappointed, very good lightweight material perfect for summer.
B00GBM0LLE|5|Great quality and very cute on!!! They fit my 2 month old and have plenty of stretch to fit her for many more months!
B00EDRZWD6|5|I'm 5'6&#34; and 142 pounds and the size 12 is perfect. The ruffles in the front help hide any little tummy bulge.
B00199FWVI|4|The wallet has plenty of space for cards. Too bad it was designed for dollars only. Made the fold out part longer and the wallet bigger (more to fold). But overall it is a good wallet and the design is spot on.
B00LXFKQ78|4|I got this shirt for my girlfriend... she is a new aunt. The shirt feels very soft (almost too soft), and the print is decent (worn look and feel, but seems quality). I would have given five stars, but the price was a bit high.
B001GHSLCU|5|This is a really fun costume wig. Lots of dreads. I mean, it does look like a wig, but it's a really fun wig at that!<br /><br />I rock it :)
B00CIYJGE2|5|This is surely the best product for what it says it does. I've used pads, double shirts, and many different kinds of deodorants, but nothing seemed to work at all to avoid the embarassing sweat marks under my arms.  I bought one to try it, and I'm so happy, I am buying a few more. It does take a bit longer to dry, but it's understandable.  Also, if you are on the heavy side like me (6'2&#34; & 300lbs), an XL size may be a bit small, unless you want it to fit tight. I like it like that so it does not bother me and it does not show when using short sleeve shirts.  Take it from Mr. Sweatman here - this is a 5 star product, worth what they charge for it... well... I'd like it to be cheaper, but at this time, there nothing else out there that works, so that's why it's still on the high side for its price.
B007BRMYGS|3|The shipping time was OK, but the T-shirt sizing on the product details is not true....<br />I order for a M size based on this description: M - Underarm to Underarm 21\\"; Length- Shoulder to Hem: 27.5\\"<br />In fact after notice how much the T-shirt was big on me ( i normally wear M size). from my measurement on the M size Underam to Underam is 23\\" not 21\\". The Tee shirt quality is OK.
B00RU0YZ9K|5|Great pajama set.  He loves them!
B00FWEGURG|4|Enjoyable shirt. The sizing for this company seems to be geared towards people who are more tall/skinny than stocky, so please take that into account when ordering sizes.
B004QF0TFQ|5|They feel sturdy.  I run size 12 in shoes, so these one-size-fit-all, fit snugly.  But securely.  And warm.  But not to wear my feet sweat feel or get too hot.  I wore these on vacation in the desert during the day and they were all-purpose.  I will be buying more.
B00INYPIXY|1|Hello ladies (or anyone else who's buying this,<br /><br />I love amazon and all it offers, and I have honestly never written a bad review before, but this is an exception. I'll start by saying this: the patterns looks AWESOME and the fabric is indeed soft (as many reviews mention), but the reality is that unless you're really short (and even then), this sweater looks like it was sewn together by a beginner. The &#34;waistline&#34; hem that you see in the second picture hit my UPPER BACK, the sleeves/arms hit a really awkward length, and all my roommates said it looked like someone washed it and shrunk it, cause it wasn't even a length I could pull off as 3/4 sleeve. Furthermore, the front part of the cardigan does not drape as the picture suggests...I know, it looks like this dress would hit you at all the right angles since they make it look like an hourglass....alas, it fails at looking or feeling good at all.<br /><br /> I REALLY REALLY tried to like this....but this sweater is not worth the money (even as low of a price as it is). You'd get a lot of comments like, &#34;omg what a pretty pattern!&#34; but then behind your back they'd be starring and wondering why it doesn't fit right...aka....pattern is good, sweater is bad. It makes me really said such an awesome print had to be made without any proper measurements (clearly) :/ In short, unless you're like 5'2 and have super short arms and potentially feel like risking having a &#34;waistline hem&#34; on your back, unfortunately, this product is just not as good as it seems. Sorry to disappoint, I just don't want anyone else to get too excited and then disappointed about the product :/
B00NNXLPKA|5|my son loves them
B00HRCO9WY|5|Sometimes when I order a &#34;small&#34;, it's just a little too form-fitting for my preference, but this shirt is great.  It's a perfect fit, the fabric is incredibly soft and the color is exactly what I'd hoped for.
B00KIHXT62|1|Took forever over a month and a half to get it and its WAY to small I can't even wear it......BOOO
B0045ON1TE|5|Very good quality. It's light, soft and bright. It's a nice gift for any age lady. I'm happy with the purchase.
B00CEH0PIE|5|Much longer than I expected and I'm 6'3&#34;, luckily there is a little shrinkage.  Collar holds its shape, which is important.
B00GZ1X6Z4|4|Good not so very good, maybe I will rate very good when there a side pockets. Over all I like it, I can alter and put pockets the way I love it. And yes it arrives earlier than I expected, so have a lot of time to do add the pockets.
B00FOSEUIQ|3|Even though it's small and my foot is 9 and a half... the heel still slips easily regardless of the rubber bit. It does help a bit but not completely.
B006UJFOHE|5|I ORDERED THIS SHIRT FOR MY DAUGHTER, WHO RECENTLY HAS GOTTEN INTO DR. WHO, AND SHE JUST LOVES IT!  IT'S NICE AND SOFT, AND WE RECEIVED IT PROMPTLY AS WELL.
B003C27VDC|2|As I now know after reading many other reviews, it is apparent that Sport-tek does not remember their roots. Price and style are important but if the size isn't true, it doesn't get worn.
B00KBS9Q7Y|2|Unfortunately, way way too small so it's being returned. Im sure the XL would not fit me either. I'm a standard Large in US sizes.<br />The design is nice and the delivery was efficient.
B0051EKMGM|1|They are cheap looking and shrunk too much right after first time wash. Don`t buy them!!!! waste money!!!  These are the worst shirt ever!!
B004UUKWWW|3|I snagged the size 8-10 in this costume for under $20.  For that price it was definitely worth it.  Very cute costume, got lots of compliments on it, and it even went through the wash fine and kept its glitter.<br /><br />I did find the top to be excessively large and had to pin it back.  I'm normally a size 4-6 but can fit into some 8s.  I'm not very big on top though, so if you are, you will be in luck with this costume.  It's very stretchy.<br /><br />Although I was pleased with the costume, I wouldn't pay more than $25 for it.  It's not built to hold up through many uses, and the little hat included, although cute, is formless and pretty much unwearable.
B00NPG5VZU|5|I'm partial to flannel but I love these fleece pjs for those cold winter nights.  Pattern is cute and fun.
B0129CYEEY|4|I like it a lot, my only issue is it is a little short on my torso. It's still cute and good quality.
B002L5Q8FS|4|I ordered this dress for my 16yrs. old for a formal event.  This was not our first choice but are overall satisfied. We really preferred the satin halter dress, but because of the way the halter was made it did not work for her body type.  This dress has the perfect fit but the color was little lighter than advertised.  The dress is very plain, but I guess we can find some type bling to add to it.  Overall, the dress nice and made of good quality.  I can't complain, since this was great price for a formal dress.
B00AHCSOWM|1|I have quite a few size fours -- found this one ultra small and very disappointing!<br />also very  short compared to other leggings.  Order a size or two larger.
B00D6CWPTI|1|I got four different colors of this bra and the fit of them is absolutely fantastic. The different colors must all be made by different companies because I ordered the Magenta me Crazy and it came with one cup that looked smooth but the other cup looked like a raisin because of the severely rumpled material beneath the cover fabric. It wasn't how it was packed either and it would never have smoothed out to match the other cup.  I ordered a new one that had the very same problem! (I still had the previous bra in my possession so the same one wasn't resent).  Like I said, my other colored bras were flawless but who ever the company is that's making the Magenta line has absolutely no quality control and their finished product sucks.  They should be embarrassed to ship out an inferior product like this!
B0009JE7DI|3|The fabric quality is nice and the body fits my baby well but the necks are super wide and actually come off her shoulders a bit.
B003JQL650|5|These leggings are very comfortable and easy to wear.  Also, when I wear these leggings I always get multiple compliments and questions on wear to purchase.
B008OQRB36|5|From a-z I am super impressed with this purchase. Not only are these gloves super adorable, they fit like, well a glove!  They are also super soft and comfortable. I bought the purple pair and the color is perfect. It is a deep muted shade that has that timeless, classic look, right down to the little bow. They came very nicely packaged, and even had a separate gift bag included. I was knocked out the minute I opened the box! Very happy customer!!
B00ELMXZA0|5|I Love how this look its a very &#34;hipster&#34; feel to it. Bowtie is adjustable I was worried it would be too big because I'm a girl I have a smaller neck but it was perfectly fine . I let my guy friend borrow it and he really liked it as well. (So don't worry fellas it would still fit you fine) . I would defiantly buy from them again.
B001JTADR6|3|Griever's head snaps from the cross fairly easily, also the item that connects Griever and the necklace tends to snap as well.
B001KTORYU|5|These are the only underpants she wants to wear.  What little girl doesn't want to wear princess underpants?  So, I should really buy another package.<br /><br />Anyhow, good quality, size is true, beautiful images.  A little unraveling of elastic, but all of them still are wearable and work (we've had them a few months).  I think they're great.  I will probably buy another package right now.  ;)
B003XVYBFS|2|This product is not a bra top as the title states. It is a fitted tank that is very small and does not have a built in bra.
B010CRTY0C|3|Ordered a Medium for a costume, but this shirt's proportions seem to be just a tad off.  The halter/collar/neck fits fine; however, the underarm / armpit areas are extremely baggy - I will have to get it taken in.  The back of the shirt - while I appreciate that it has an elastic band, it is just too large and hangs - I'll have to get that portion taken in as well.  The length of the shirt is good and the fit throughout the waist is fine (with room to spare).  Fit issues aside, I do like the accent buttons and overall the shirt is decent - remember, it's a steal and not a formal tuxedo shirt from Neiman's or Saks.  For context - I'm 5'8, 140 lbs, neck 12.25&#34;, shoulders 40&#34;, chest 35&#34;, waist 28&#34;.
B00R6QUDCQ|2|These pants are baggy through the legs and very short in the crotch.  They are basically just denim jogging pants.  I thought they would be like a comfortable pair of jeans but I don't like the way they look.  I will just use these for working around the house.  They are lightweight and fairly comfortable.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review
B008VPS580|5|Good
B0012QT1DI|5|To be brief, these briefs are the best. Once you go Barelythere, you cannot go back. I like the full briefs, but you can choose briefer briefs if you like. They hold up well and are very comfortable.
B00AVXB36G|5|The grandchildren went to Disney Land for a three day vacation.  They<br />did not leave without Grandma outfitting them for the occasion.
B00KIHLS42|3|I read and reread the measurements so I would be sure to get the right size. After measuring my own waist and factoring in my small pregnant belly and knowing I normally wear 8/10 but what the measurements suggested on actual sizes for waist / bust made it seem an XL would be better.<br />What I didn't factor in or even read about was that the waistband was ELASTIC. Now the dress fits too large and I'm going to have to do some altering so I'm able to keep it on.<br /><br />They definitely need to update their sizing and description to add the ELASTIC waistband.<br />Maybe include that the M/L is 8-10 and XL is 14-16.
B00HN2ZYGS|5|It has room to grow in based on the material type. Its ok for the price I paid. No faults to say I would not recommend.
B005DIFMYS|5|Cinch jeans are great fitting and super comfortable. These are comparable to Harley or Carhartt. I love these jeans period.
B0014J3LX4|4|They would be better if they had a heel grip.  The name should also be on the bottom instead of across the toes.  HUE hangs out on the side in my mary-janes!
B00AWMO4WG|5|The Color is perfect. It fits well. After the first wash though it looses it's shape, but it is still cute.
B005I73XKY|3|I am a size 10 but these run way too small! I would even say they are more like a 6. I wear a 10 in CK jeans and sometimes an 8.
B00SYB9E7C|4|I read the other people's comments so I got my sister the large instead of medium, which she wears, and it fit perfectly.
B0045S0H1K|5|I got this for my wedding (Renaissance/pirate themed). Helped make our wedding look like what we wanted. Fit very nicely.
B000BLKOUO|1|My husband got a pair for Christmas.  They did NOT live up to the product description.  They were loose, soft and comfortable, but forget the durable.  These \\"Work Horse\\" jeans only made it to work for 3 hours before they split from the crotch down the leg about 3\\"-4\\". At $29.99 that works out about $10 per hour for wear--definitely not a good deal.  Will stick to the Rip Stop jeans from now on, as they have proven to last.
B00916QBIE|5|Super comfy & exactly what I wanted. Light, casual & they fit perfectly! Think I'm going to buy them in every color!
B00AJ36WG4|5|The item came very quickly and was a great price.
B00HG7FBEA|4|Very cute, is quite green in person.  More green then I expected, it looked closer to teal I thought in the picture.
B00ACIGM9S|5|Good UW.  Fit and quality are good...no holes so far!
B00JM47U4Y|5|Linda
B00ABKARS4|2|The whole point of this thing was to have longer legs in a mens boxer brief.  This was NOT what was advertised.  They are the standard length for briefs.  They also weren't boxer briefs, they were regular boxers.  They didn't fit snug and weren't any longer than any other briefs that I have had.  I would return them but I know I can't.  Guess I will just go back to Walmart to get the ones that I initially started with.  This sucked!
B00AECT1ZE|5|These are the first socks I've ever ordered online. They're much nicer than I thought.<br />They fit well and I like the bit of compression they provide.<br />Probably the best socks I've ever owned.
B0067VMXQK|5|I must tell you these shoes got more attention than the baby. They were gorgeous and fit his size one feet perfectly. They really added the perfect finishing touch to his Baptism outfit.
B00BOOTTPI|3|THE IS A LITTLE TO THICK FOR A TIE
B00CU5148A|5|No Review<br /><br />This was a gift for my daughter.  It fit well and is just plain cute.  She lves it.
B00R7X96GM|5|Very nice but a bit pricey
B00M9VXR8A|5|Absolutely perfect quality and fit as expected...
B00E30W8KS|4|They were just her size!!
B0096DREBK|5|My wife looks awesome in this, I bought it for our anniversary and we couldn't be happier with it. It fits great, it looks great, and its a great price.
B0081STN4W|1|Waaaay blg ordered Med got XX-Lrg. Just can't keep them on. Why can't you just get the size right I love the shorts. Try me and I'll re-write this.
B00NHOCA90|4|Cute but not as cute as the picture
B008LD1VUG|5|Love the design of this and the feel of the cotton material.  Baby has worn it so much I lost count.  The hat however was a bit large for his size head.  I think my baby's head is on the smaller size, but it's fine if you just want to throw it over to cover from the sun for a short time while sitting.  Baby's not a hat person anyway.  Cutest outfit ever!
B001IVX3YK|5|always wore banana republic jeans but these jeans fit great look great comfortable and a lot less cheaper
B00NMDV8M6|5|I was looking for a fall scarf, and I love this one!!
B00PN4LLJW|5|Good
B00BAWXGI0|4|I like it
B00284B5T6|2|I was disappointed with the compression considering that it is called the Ultimate Slimmer. It does smooth out bumps but it didn't make my tummy any smaller. I also bought the Miraclesuit Shapewear High Waist Brief and that one had much better compression.
B000PGXNSA|5|Great!
B007W0XSOG|2|I guess I'd order the next size up if I really wanted it to be a wearable item.  Oh well.
B0053O1O8U|5|Perfect fit, great costume. Would definitely recommend it !
B00I4R4Q4W|4|It's too large for me, I often wear NIKE sweater of SIZE M, and this T-Shirt is too large for me, maybe I bought a wrong size.
B00GKF5EDC|4|Good Quality...but big
B000NZW3IY|5|I must admit that before reading these 478 reviews I had strong reservations about the wolf t-shirt. I feared it may be too powerful. I especially worried about its affect on my rehab group therapy members. By after spending all of my work-release day reading and re-reading the reviews, I came away believing the shirt possessed more power for good than evil. So many lives had been touched in a positive way by the wolf shirt, and frankly I wanted some of that magic to rub off, particularly with my sentencing date approaching. So I pulled the trigger (a phrase I should refrain from using so close to my court appearance) and ordered what I then saw as my 'wardrobe of salvation'. When I arrived at the courthouse, I half-expected the prosecutor - who must have grown up in these same Kentucky hills - to take one look at the shirt, wipe a tear from his eye, and recommend the dismissal of all charges. But unfortunately when I found myself in the same room with my co-defendants for the first time since the regrettable incident, I was shocked to find they were all three wearing wolf shirts (though none as fabulous as my own). The judge assumed it was a sign of stone-walling solidarity and perhaps even a threat of gang-related retaliation, and he sent us all to separate prisons around the state. But I do not blame the wolf shirt. It now awaits me with the rest of my personal belongings in a storeroom near central processing. Some nights, as I lay quietly in my cell, I can hear the wolf shirt calling to me, howling in an encouraging manner. I do not blame you wolf shirt, I do not blame you...       Pros:  Wolves represented on a black T-shirt howling at the moon.  Cons:  Possible misinterpretation by judicial figures;  tag is a little scratchy so I would suggest cutting it out;  position of Shackleton's Crater as represented on the moon image appears to be several hundred kilometers off.

B00H3NWDMU|4|Well, you could have knocked me down with a feather when I saw these Ann Arbor garments for sale!  Especially to find my home at Inverythan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland (  population: 13 humans, 13 cats, 4 dogs, a donkey and a guinea pig ) described as a 'City'.  I know this company has identical apparel with 'Inverness' printed on them, and as the generic design includes the Loch Ness Monster I guess that's the market they were aiming for.  I'm just baffled to see 'Inverythan' emblazoned on the front!  Hope they haven't made TOO many of them!<br /><br />Four stars for putting a smile on my face!  The quality looks excellent, and I MIGHT even buy one!
B00FALM066|4|this reaches right at my knees, i am 5'4&#34; :) colors are as pictured, belt is attached, not removable.  the only thing i don't like is the back above the belt is see thru, so bra strap or slip shows.... :( i would have rated 5 star if that wasn't the case.  I'd recommend this for women with slightly larger busts i had to inch in my under arm seems, and the V isn't too low for lot of cleavage.
B00MFKWX12|1|Um, this is such a weird sweater. Couldnt figure out which side was the front, and its short in the back. Poorly made sweater, but it is comfy and keeps me warm. And with the right accessories and confidence anyone could rock it.
B008KE4BGW|3|Fantastic cut and fit, but it is see-through. Wouldn't have bought it if I had realized that.
B005MQNSPQ|5|Bought this for my mom in the sea glass color. She loved it. Having bought this same flannel night gown in two other colors for some friends I know that it is a very thick high quality flannel. I will keep this in mind for future gifts and maybe one day get one for myself. If you like flannel night gowns you should really like this one. Great price great product.
B000632U5O|4|Good looking although cheaply made,
