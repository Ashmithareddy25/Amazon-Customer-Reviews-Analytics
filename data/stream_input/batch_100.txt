B00T1766QU|5|I was looking for a good kit for my ATV when I came across this product. It is one of the best products to use. I have already used this GOOFIT L7T Spark Plug Ignition Coil 44mm Cylinder Piston Kit for 49cc ATV and Pocket Bike for both my pocket bike and 49cc ATV. The bike piston hasn’t given me any trouble since I started using this kit.<br />The 44mm cylinder piston kit is exactly what I needed and has promised to live up to my expectations. Interestingly, the kit has everything that I needed such as the L7T spark plug, cylinder piston and ignition coil. At such a reasonable price, this product is definitely the best and undoubtedly a value for money.<br />I have recommended the product to my brother and he is really happy with this and can’t live without it. Well, this kit is a life saver for me and I would highly recommend it to all.
B000PS8J64|5|easy to install and well built, should last a long time!
B002R1PWWQ|5|Just installed yesterday. Looks great=works great. Very happy!
B00KTIYXLU|4|Great price for this remote. I followed the easy instructions and it worked better than the one that came with my car.  The only thing is only one can work at a time. You must reprogram but the bottom line is it works.
B000VKODIO|5|This fit my Toyota 2002 Highlander perfectly. Why wait until speedy lube brings out your dirty filter and then charges you three times as much? Just do it. Youtube will show you how.
B00OOCP38O|4|Well the light bar came in today. Before installation I realized that the light bar in the pictures only looked half way like the one I received. It said Cree chips and in the pictures it showed a square Cree chip but when I opened the box I found out quickly it wasn't the same. I do have to say it is very very bright! I'm disappointed in the so called &#34;Cree lights&#34; but I'm in love. Now to see how it does during rain.
B005R4LECC|1|I bought these light and they do not fit. You rely on the website to ensure that if it states that it's the right fit, it will be but that's not the case. And with a 2 week return policy it's not enough time. So my money was wasted do not buy!
B000CGM1D6|5|Saved a lot of money buy purchasing this from Amazon, approximately $60 compared to all the local auto parts stores. Did not want to tackle the replacement of the fuel pump alone (no one to help me) so my mechanic did the job. He charged me $120 which seemed fair. Purchased it for my 2001 Silverado 5.3 liter.
B004O9WC18|4|Great item, to protect the lining of your cargo area. The liner will slide a little if there's hard breaking or acceleration, but nothing bad really.
B003ENE6LO|5|The hook did fit really well with provided nut and bolt and a socket wrench. No special tool required.
B00W4XO62O|5|I'm proud to display it.
B009QRWHYK|5|It fit my 2008 Honda Civic beautifully and accommodated a Thule car top carrier for a 2000 mile trip exceptionally well.
B00MWCYI34|3|hard to put on and was missing cover for console which description says was included with purchase
B00342XWVK|5|Thanks!
B000CPI5XW|5|I started using this a couple years ago upon the recommendation of many forum members for a clunky, noisy tranny on my 2001 Dyna Defender. At this point, I can't imagine running anything else. It quieted and smoothed out all shifts and makes neutral much easier to find. I've even went on to change my manual trannied car (2003 Mazda) over to this brand with similar effects in it.<br /><br />No more jump starts at the light when you kick your bike into first!
B0050SFVO2|5|Thanks!
B00G6UNUF0|5|Very easy to install
B0002SR48G|5|great quality
B003TQ3CPC|5|Magnaflow mufflers and cats are the best.  This has a 2.5 opening for use with 2.5 pipe.
B00NXUA8X8|1|Horrible color retention.  5 coats and this is just starting to look like a solid white.  Took me way to many cans to get the engine white.
B008S9CHW4|4|Fine,<br /> But was smaller than what i guess !! L
B00T9H5PJ6|5|So far so good I have had it on my f250 for 5 days now.
B00KMBEMZG|5|Great! Just what I needed without having to. replace the remote.
B00G6IQYAU|1|Doing a complete restoration of a motorcycle for my wife.  We purchased a brand new seat cover (Black vinyl).  We wanted the seat to be brown to work w the paint she had chosen.  Obviously, I wanted this color to last.<br /><br />After reading many reviews from delighted customers.  Ordered the Colorbond prep cleaner, Adhesion Promoter, and LVP spray dye.  Followed instructions for all three products.  Watched the tutorials on the Colorbond website.  Waited til we had nice weather and plenty of uninterrupted free time.<br /><br />The finish went on smoothly and turned out beautiful.  Gave it plenty of cure time.  A week or so.  At first it seemed to be pretty tough stuff...I was really impressed.<br /><br />Over a couple weeks, rode the motorcycle 3-4 short trips around the neighborhood.  Pleased as punch w Colorbond finish.<br /><br />Rode bike yesterday.  Wearing Levis blue jeans.  And the Colorbond is starting to RUB OFF the seat.  Exposing the original black finish of the vinyl.<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTED.  COLORBOND LASTED 5 RIDES OVER A COUPLE WEEKS.
B004NNOH9A|5|The replacement light was a perfect fit for my son's car. I installed it in less than 20 minutes. I am very pleased with this item. I would purchase it again.
B000WJ7FF2|5|Wow! Fast free delivery(3 days), great price, and exact fit. What's stopping you from also buying?
B00WAL5JVM|5|fast service and quality part
B000RXKR6M|4|Was on a friend's birthday list. Was a convenient purchase.
B00QLFD5N2|5|These are a great product. They have a long lasting scent that is not overpowering. They  were  mailed out quickly and packaged well.
B0002KKTTA|5|works great.
B00SGGTO1Q|4|Great
B004QJMG80|3|For what it is, this works decently. Its just a pain in the butt to have to clean it after every few working areas because it gets so clogged with product even when using as directed, and pea sized drops of polish. I used compressed air to blow out the excessive product. The benefits just don't outweigh the performance of a good foam pad. Also, don't wash these in the washing machine if you want them to last. use a good microfiber/foam pad cleaner. The washing machine will delaminate the pad after 2 to 4 cycles.
B00N509LP2|4|Good value.  Pretty comprehensive.  Although I added a few things like road maps and emergency water.
B000C5CEC0|2|I received the order without &#34;SEAL&#34;
B000E24APU|5|great product worked as expected, Highly recommend.
B0070Y35OC|5|Excellent product - I am just terrible at putting it on.
B01092I9LA|5|Item was exactly as described. I'm very pleased with my car seat covers and would order them again from FH Group. Item was well packaged and came with installation instructions. I purchased the gray set. They look great in my 2013 Nissan Cube. I received them on 8/13/15 the earliest date indicated.
B00P2SLQZ8|4|They definitely look a little plasticy and stick out a bit from my rims, but they're well priced and do the good pretty well.
B002XM5G70|5|Works great
B005CLNMD4|4|Good but really wish it wasn't just made of just plastic
B000IYISY8|5|Perfect replacement for my upstream (closer to the engine) sensor on my 5.4 Expedition. Drivers side is an easy ten minute job. Passenger side is very tight for tools, a standard crescent wrench worked for me at just the right angle (parallel to the exhaust pipe). Adapters and O2 sensor tools wouldn't appear to fit well in the limited space. Easily took 45 minutes or more.
B000CQHVLI|4|Best Muffler cement I have used.  Simple and easy to work with.
B000C9DJ2K|5|Worked good
B0007N5758|5|Does an excellent job of cleaning my dirty fingers; the side hard-bristled brush finishes off what ever else might be left.
B00CIMBOTY|2|If you plan on installing them yourself, think again.  Had to take car to a reputable muffler shop.  Both sides, the hangers had to be cut relocated and welded.  The flanges didn't work either had to weld mufflers to exhaust pipes, had clamp tightened all the way was still lose.  They do sound great for a V6.
B0024ECE22|4|These containers are great for our RV. It's so nice not to have to measure anything out or clean a cup after using it to measure. Being able to just toss the bottle when we are done is nice after a long trip. We have ordered these from Amazon a few times. Once, one of the bottles was leaking when we got it which was a little messy, but easy to clean and there was still enough in the bottle to be usable (this is why I took off one star).
B00479SK66|1|Not the size for my mb<br />Model even though you promote it as the indicated one
B006TMTHKC|4|Had to use a few pieces from the one I was replacing.  Other than that, great price and works well.
B000CQOIVE|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B00JU7LQ8Y|5|Great product shipped fast fit perfect
B001G9B5XK|5|Easy to install. Leveled my Sequoia when towing our RV.
B00DR15LOO|4|This top is awesome. I had a hard time getting the download for instructions sent to me but started installing and that day right when I got to the part I was confused on they were received and I was set. I have never done a top before but consider myself above average at these type of repairs. It was a challenge and rewarding when completed.
B005IZ17CC|4|works good
B00E0OQAGK|5|Like it
B0082OU772|5|Worth every penny
B00EED8COA|1|These Decals say (Face Gum) I took that to mean they were glued on the face for applying to the inside of my window to face outward. They are only a Static Cling decal, What in the world is Face Gum???
B0012XIV82|5|Great for kayaks. Beats the ropes that come with kakyaks. Very easy to use.
B00IKSN0CE|4|Good for the price. They just sit a little bit low than the stock ones.
B000C54496|5|High quality better than OEM
B00BVYEUQ4|4|Bright and they work very well. I am impressed.
B00KTIZ2C4|1|Will not work.
B001UGLPAC|5|These are very effective at reducing if not eliminating the annoying rocking and swaying a travel trailer is haunted with. They do take considerable critical thought to plan the installation. The install time took me over 1/2 a day taking my time to do it right. Lippert makes many products for travel trailers including frames, so they know how their products can be improved. Why these don't come standard on the trailer is beyond me. All in al, this is a great product that delivers the intended result!
B00877SL2M|5|Extremely bright
B00CASDZKC|5|Great product!  Keeps the black marks off my seat!
B004VQM4A8|5|great product, sounds awesome at 3k,
B00SGZ1AGY|5|Great product. It is very bright was worried it was going to be a cheap knock off but it works and performs greatly. 0 condensation or fogging of glass. Excellent quality.
B0126GJ4UW|4|The seal looks to be nice quality, shipping was very fast
B006B279NM|2|Advertised to fit a 05 klr250. Out of the box they did not fit. I had to use a dremel and file to clean up the poor quality forging. Still cheaper than paying a shop to replace the brakes but their quality control is sub-standard.
B000TRBOK4|5|I have an R Pod trailer by Forest River. This tub fits perfectly in the sink.
B0090NQQ2Y|5|Perfect!
B00R1X85Z6|5|No issues.  It went right in like it was supposed to.
B00192JFF4|4|not easy to install but with patients possible so far has taken several trips and held safe. keep you posted
B00RO8SGGG|5|Great  quality  very  rugged  not  pleased with the  cable  to  unlatch otherwise  happy with it
B008N1UUS0|5|Good product and fast shipping!!!
B0084FSQ9K|1|not worth the time or any HID's tried them all never made it threw a winter
B00OPJFTOE|5|Terrific! Order arrived right on time!
B00Y2NWXN8|5|great jdm billet screws.
B000WBQ4U2|5|Great tool, I think I have the only tool like in our town.<br />I now have the ac working in my 1978 Buick regal<br />Thanks R.L.Long
B000A0CAGM|5|Perfect fit.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Worked exactly as advertised.  I have a car problem and have had to use the jump 4 or 5 times already.
B00CU8ZN34|4|works
B000CIXZFM|1|Both we're bent and scratch. Very unsatisfied
B0000AY4YJ|5|I keep this stuff on my boat at all times because it is a great general cleaning solution for the seats and deck.  There is stuff out there that is more powerful but it also is a bit abrasive and does not have the protectant built in to help fight sun and water.  The water beads up nicely on the vinyl after using.  Highly recommend.
B000C93ESO|5|very  perfect fit
B00ONDM07G|5|Got this brilliantly fast from Amazon. I don't know how they do it. Product is exactly as described, does exactly what is claimed. Took a couple of minute to install. Fits perfect. Has no 'added on ' look. I got it for my Go-Pro but also holds my 6+ just fine.
B00OJHPQSQ|3|Normally not needed; but when you do it's great.
B000G72W1C|5|Perfect replacement part.
B000CJRJQC|5|very good filter, i like it. thanks
B00KTGLCW0|5|Worked as advertised. They were not very helpfull in getting a return on the core. I had to pry the info out of them.
B001EEXJUE|5|On time and as expected.  Super easy install to replace tired factory parts.
B006PASA5Q|5|Nice product. Matches interior, great fit, and amazing value.
B009DJRQJM|2|When I plugged the vehicle information in i was told this was the correct part.  Unfortunately it was not.  However, it did arrive in a timely fashion
B000CNJKXS|5|A+
B00RNIQQS2|5|Awiwichu a merri crismas
B001NZO4KI|1|Transmission lines are smaller than factory tubing and will not work. The mounting bolt on the passenger side is different than OEM and will cause the mounting bolt to puncture the radiator. Buyer beware.
B00MQ4WXQ2|4|They said that this carpet would be made within 48 hours of the order being placed. 5 days after I ordered it Amazon showed it as delivered. I was a little disappointed to find only an installation instruction CD; the carpet was delivered two days later which was still earlier than the expected delivery date to interior Alaska. Kudos guys. A little lighter weight than I would have thought but I did buy the least expensive one. The color was right however and it was molded, the foot pad and the floor pan padding are in the same place as the original. I went to a box store and bought an equipment mat (36x78 for 20 bucks,) and cut and glued it to the floor pan using spray can type contact cement. Interior Alaska and 90 miles one way to work you want all the insulation you can get. Using a 3/4 inch hole saw in reverse mode on the drill I made clean cuts in the carpet for the seats and seat belts. With the extra padding under it I had to do no trimming at all, perfect fit. Gotta love it, inexpensive and looks great.
B00JJ3R8RC|4|looks good,fast delivery,all that I expected,  Thanks
B00XBEJZA8|5|I cannot compare this light-bar to others, as this is my first one.  I can however say that this light-bar is incredibly bright!  As tacky as it may be (my choice in mounting it on a car, not the light), I mounted this to the front of my car for greatly increased night time visibility.  I live in a rural country town and deer are a severe problem here, the extra light this bar puts out helps to see them well before they become a problem.<br /><br />Installation was easy, it came with tools to assemble the mounts on the light (not tools to actually bolt it to your vehicle).  Some quick wiring with a fuse, relay, and switch, and i was ready to roll.<br /><br />I've only had it on for a little over a day, but this thing seems to be perfectly capable of handling small debris hitting it (mounted quite low on the front of my car), and all the water puddles i can throw at it.<br /><br />I did receive this light bar at a discount in return for my review, but I would not hesitate to buy this light again if I needed another.<br /><br />Note: I wired the light-bar to only come on with the high beams when a separate switch i installed is also on.  So I can have the high beams on and decide if I also want the light-bar or not.
B006G4077U|5|Nice price, good quality socks for my hot running, wire frying 91 Corvette! I would buy again!
B004JLEOCQ|3|Have a nice day
B00XL72HQ4|5|Awesome they were tight fit . But that's exactly what you want !!!
B00029XD7G|5|all good
B00R6S0MEI|5|I can't speak to longevity as yet, but the initial feel and quality is excellent. The mechanism for adjusting spray intensity and pattern is the smoothest of any of the four I have tried.
B002OAV7XS|5|Great bag! Fits the tools and more.<br />Thanks!!
B00EECM5FI|5|Passenger side went out on 2007 Saab 9-3 so I bought this as a replacement for both instead of paying ridiculous prices at automotive shops. A pair of these cost less than half of just one bulb anywhere else. Noticeably brighter than the OEM bulbs I replaced. The only downside I've had so far is that they were a little difficult to install. They do fit but they were quite a bit harder than the OEM bulbs were to get lined up correctly. Had them installed for about a month now and still working great, will update later if either fail early.
B00VDQMT40|5|Exactly as described!
B00G66KNZY|5|nice helmet
B00FALVU8A|5|Can't believe how serious this product is. I've use a few other wax brands before this and I have to say WOW....
B00HTP8N0I|5|Easy to use and very strong.  I use these to strap my touring bike on the trailer
B00E0LZYLA|5|Nice quality. Would recommend.
B002J7O95Y|4|I love this thing. I already had a bunch of microfiber rags and this goes perfectly with them for dry dusting my floor. With 2 dogs and a cat I can pick up a lot of hair with this thing, a lot more hair than I even knew was there. After my dad installed hardwood floors in his house I got him one for Father's Day and he loves it too. He just loves how easily it picks up all the cat hair.<br /><br />This thing is basically a more eco-friendly and cost effective Swiffer, so if that's what you're looking for then buy this.<br /><br />Oh, my little kids (2 and 4) love this thing too. I make the handle short for them and they run around the house picking up animal hair, sometimes they even fight over it so I'm thinking about buying another one. I just love it when my 2 year old yells at me to &#34;put a rag on it&#34; so she can go sweep the floors.<br /><br />***Edit***<br />I just lowered the star rating by 1 star because my kids broke part of this mop. I contacted customer service to ask about any type of warranty and never heard back. I would have been fine and just bought another one if I had gotten an e-mailing stating they only had a 30 day warranty or even no warranty. But to never even respond is just terrible customer service. The kids still get to use this mop but I have recently bought a Fiber Mop for myself. I bought a Fiber Mop 11 piece kit which is double the price for this mop but I like it and it seems like it will hold up better.
B008VR5WD4|5|Well made and easy to install. Good quality and style.
B000LPMI54|4|Definitely better acceleration, but tends to not have horsepower past 3000rpms
B002VU29XS|5|Protuct works and look awesome .5 stars
B000C16XK8|4|Worked as expected
B005URC84Y|5|Great price, shipped fast, installed on a 2003 bmw 325i no problem. Gives it a really nice growl above 3K rpms, makes you really want to gun it in 2nd and 3rd gear in steptronic mode. Does feel a bit faster, and seems to have given it around 0.5 mpg extra. Definitely worth it on an e46
B00JU65OP6|1|Didn't work as expected at all.
B00K779E9E|5|Did the job!
B000WJF4HS|3|I received this item quickly, However I had to modify the bracket to get it to fit around the switch housing on the handlebar.  I bought this because it said it fit my bike (2009 Vstar 1300 cruiser) without modification.  This is incorrect info, I would suggest revising the list of bikes this actually fits on.  Anyway, once I bought the longer bolt and spacer washers, it worked fine.  The threads on this part are unique, I ended up having to &#34;modify&#34;  the brass threaded collar inside the handlebar bracket to accept a standard thread.  Once those two issues were corrected it works fine.<br /><br />Loctite EVERYTHING.  After a single test ride the handlebar bracket came loose and almost fell off,  (like 2 or 3 threads left on the bolts they provide)<br />After torqueing everything down with Loctite everywhere it hasn't come loose again after a six hour ride.  So overall 3 stars for having to modify things but operability is still there.
B00NF1Q3EI|5|exactly like the OEM and cheaper than buying it at an auto store
B00KGGTGO4|4|Nice really big shade....more than covers my f350 windshield..
B001QU9NC4|5|Fits my 94 yj jeep wrangler perfectly
B009ZCADF6|1|I bought this throttle cable assuming it was an exact OEM replacement. Unfortunately it has one minor and one major deviation. The 90 degree elbow is about 3/8-inch diameter whereas the original is closer to 1/2-inch. This is results in the elbow being able to move around in the bracket opening in the event the nuts loosen...not a major issue, but could be a concern. The bigger issue is that as part of the manufacturing process, they stopped the threads 1/4 inch short on the elbow. Now, let's say the space between the carburetor throttle lever and the cable mounting bracket is about 5 inches. When the mounting nuts are moved to their lowest position on the cable elbow (the longest adjustment possible), you can only get about 4-3/4 inches. This causes the ski to be idle at red-line. I called the SBT and they could only understand the stop to stop length and the cable sleeve to cable sleeve length, whereas the most critical measurement to maintain is the mounting bracket to throttle lever. My solution was to use the longer OEM wire inside the SBT sleeve and use brass wire stops with SS set screws. If you're smart enough to install this, you're smart enough to make it work, but it is not an OEM replacement.
B0041P5T24|5|By far one of the coolest aesthetic mods I've made to my 2003, 1200 Sportster. I also felt a difference in performance right after installing it. Others have mentioned having to rejet the carbs, but my bike sounds fine. I'll eventually check the spark plugs though to make sure.<br /><br />Installation was almost too easy as the filter bracket is pretty straight forward. I ran into no problems as everything lined up perfectly. Depending on how big of a perfectionist you are, this kit isn't quite perfect though. The plate that mounts up against the air filter does get a slight concave crater once you begin to tighten the bolt down properly. This doesn't bother me however. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product for anyone of any skill level.
B00DB8K55S|1|Doesn't fit right and poor customer service
B001O7PNS2|4|I'm very satisfied with the Product ,Product is exactly as described<br />Great seller! Fast shipping.Great price and Quality product.<br />Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again
B002I1EDT8|1|Not as expected. Not proportioned for all vehicles as stated and the plastic around letters collects dirt
B006BBHEJW|5|It's big! Never saw anything like this but I actually love it. One  of my friends was standing a few feet away from my car and she's like for your car smells really good. That's a good thing.
B006L80QHM|5|Smoother, more precise shifting. Easy install. No complaints so far.
B00MLP30IG|5|Love it! Looks great
B00VT1S5G0|4|Only had this for a couple of months but I love it. Will see how it holds up this winter, the price is fantastic
B00132CH46|5|Easy to install
B007OUPSII|5|very nice wear it with pride
B003UM7B98|5|Seems sturdy and well made, I like the large, rubber covered contact point. On the one hand, I don't care for the long handle, on the other hand, I like that you can leave it on the jack, and just leave the jack in a corner of the garage because the handle stays at a 90 degree angle.
B000CN5QG8|4|great
B003S0B9EA|5|Goood
B00ANVNV20|5|No problem putting them on. They didn't crack like I read in most reviews. Good price looks nice
B0002NIF70|5|Good quality and great price.
B00D2QL0DU|4|I got this specifically to use when changing the oil in my mower (so I could be an Independent Woman and all that).  I wanted to be able to siphon out the old stuff rather than turn my mower over to pour out.  It works well - but I suggest not being SO independent that you don't ask another person to help.  I did it okay by myself, but it would be a lot easier with an extra set of hands.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that it could be a multipurpose tool.  I realized, however, that after using it for old, dirty motor oil I wouldn't want to use it for anything else - it would just be too gross and too much trouble to clean.<br /><br />Now I can feel like Wonder Woman and save money and time doing my own oil changes.  I think I'll use the extra money for ice cream.
B005DLNDVY|5|Great mirrors
B004RNOW64|5|Okay. This thing is honking huge. It's a frickin weapon. That's about my only criticism--it's a bit unwieldy. On the plus side, that means extra reach and room for fuel.<br /><br />I have tried a fair number of these long-neck lighters. Most recently before this one, I tried the Zippo Flex Neck Utility, which so far has been a POS. I am on my second return with them--and they charge you to return it even if it is defective. Ridiculous!  Enough about them, though..<br /><br />This one is great. The flame is huge. I bought this to upgrade my smoker/grill lighting experience, and it has totally delivered. I use a chimney for my grill, and it launches the paper on fire. I use lighter blocks for my smoker, and it lets me easily reach and light them in the firebox drawer. It has two safety switches, and it has a safety light mechanism, so I feel safe having it where my kids might get to it (not that I intentionally leave it out for them ;) ).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great refillable utility lighter, the best I've found so far. Just keep in mind it is a monster.
B005BWIBN0|4|Yes it works. But the lock text on the handle is on the wrong side of the locking latch, making it somewhat confusing if the door is locked or not.
B00JZG2J3G|1|Useless. Do Not Buy. Has no light projection value. Can serve only as day running light. No focused beam to render it a usable  headlight bulb.
B004AY3NHE|5|Best muffler repair tape out there!  I tried everything else and this is by far the best and strongest.
B00YM8JC1O|5|Top notch. True german replacement part. Perfect.
B00J42PK6O|4|Nice cap but unable to fit my bike.
B004K0TTVM|4|Worked great on my 2008 Nissan Altima 3.5 SE.
B009XU8W6W|1|Nothing like what it was suppose to be. Legs were too long than my original one.
B007VCOIAS|5|The overall fit once placed, is the best I've seen<br />yet (even though I have this brand for another vehicle).  It may take a bit of tussling to seat it into place, but once in, it's a great cover to block out the sun - there's some light that comes through the center of for the rear view mirror, but you need that clearance to get it through in the first place.
B000MNN4WQ|5|These operate great and meet all my expectations. Recommend to other people.
B00SWRDU5A|1|Much smaller than picture shows!
B006YBCXLI|5|I just wanted to add my positive review to the others already posted for these mats.  They fit the front and rear of my 2010 Santa Fe SE 5-passenger perfectly.  They are lightweight but seem to be durable and they look much nicer than those ribbed rubber mats.<br /><br />The only thing I might add is they do not have the floor hook holes as the pictures show.  Even without the hook holes, they do not move or slide at all and really seem to hug into place.
B001MZZ61A|4|These are very nice, I get eye when driving makes the ride standout with the newer models. Sweet!
B000C2QMZI|5|Fit perfect like OEM.
B00HSIF7YQ|5|great deal and a great help
B007WR25GG|5|This cartop carrier was amazing. We used it for a trip of over 7,000 miles and it performed beautifully in the heat and cold.  We went through drenching rain, wind and even a hail storm and our belongings stayed dry and secure.  It was easy to load each morning and unload each evening.  Throughout the trip it was quiet and dependable.  We highly recommend it.
B00AOYXATA|5|Great product
B00877SL2M|5|Great price and fast shipping!
B00E34AVZ8|4|These look good and are easy to install
B000GU168O|1|One mirror? Really? ! Who does that? The description says &#34;mirrors&#34;
B0040CVZN0|5|OEM fit and performance. Was easy to solder into wiring harness. Should last indefinitely.
B0058WXNOK|5|saved me a fortune !
B0033YZLA4|1|no mounting parts
B007AOQQ52|5|Excellent fit.  Appears to be of good quality.  It is sturdy.  Of course only time and wear will prove the value.
B00NYYJ1E0|1|They fell apart during installation they currently don't grip correctly and spin while my hands are on the handlebars he's a cheap piece of crap and I wouldn't recommend them for anybody
B00913O3ZK|5|These are wonderfully made.  Was very easy to install with great instructions.  Only wish I would have known about sooner before our dog scratched the leather.
B0087NB1IW|5|A very good product, I'm very satisfaced with the purchase
B002R0OI90|4|It worked and installed properly.  There was nothing extraordinary about it.
B005Y5TW1O|5|This helmet is adorable and sexy combined. I ride on the back of my boyfriend's motorcycle and I needed a helmet but I didn't want to pay $100+ for occasional use. I got a size medium which fits perfectly. It isn't too tight but it's not loose either. The padding inside is comfortable as well. The matte coating is another perfect touch to it. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cute, comfortable, and affordable helmet!
B000182CPM|4|I only give this four stars for the following reason.  They have to be replaced periodically.  The first set I purchased lasted about three years, though I could have replaced them after two.  After a few trips through the car was they tend to bend and bow.  You can straighten this out by hand in most instances, but after some time they just start to look trashy.<br /><br />When they are brand new, it is a must have on your truck.  They really do make your vehicle stand out from the others.  Especially if you have a lot of factory chrome on your truck.<br /><br />Good, but could be a little better at a higher price.
B005CLL4K2|5|nice

B009OBVRY4|5|I have always been a hands-on guy, but have also always been scared to buff my own cars, especially our black Lexuses.  But after I had a crappy experience with a local detail shop, I spoke with a PDR (paintless dent removal) professional and he recommended a bunch of products, polishes and waxes to me.  I found this Meguiar unit and took the plunge.  I mounted it to my rechargeable Ryobi drill, though I was worried the drill wouldn't have enough staying power or torque to run this buffer properly.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  The two work together like hand and glove.  I did a bunch of wet sanding on my wife's Lexus (using the 3M denibbing tool and 1500 grit inserts), then used multiple grits of Meguiar's and 3M compounds to shine everything up.  I worked up a better sweat than I thought I would, but the end result was fantastic.  I will say that the dull areas the denibber caused took a LOT more polishing than I thought they would, so I urge caution if using a denibbing tool, even with 1500-grit inserts.  And be careful with this Meguiar tool, as running the edge of the pad along the car will cause some marks you'll have to work hard to get out.  Having said that, I'm angry with myself from shying away from doing my own polishing all these years, as this Meguiar tool made the job far easier than I thought it would...and yielded results that are far better than I hoped for.  I highly recommend this tool!
B007N6YYI8|2|After the communication back and forth before buying, and the assurance the trunk lid struts would work as an excellent replacement, the Lexus LS430 trunk is as hard to open now as before, and harder to close now than before, and this is not good for the almost 80 year old senior I thought I was helping.
B00VXNK490|4|Very sturdy hinges and seems well made. Slight bend in the visor, not exactly flat. Also received with a few scratches. But works very well, having it polarized makes all the difference.
B00CFALFXY|5|Great turn around time and the cloths are work horses!
B000EDUUJ4|5|Just what I needed
B004J0SPSG|3|Fans worked shroud was busted and not usable luckily i still had the old shroud
B00HLW18T2|5|Great Light
B004809YBE|4|works good
B005VG3CNK|1|The Headlights look cool and the HID set up lasted 3 months before it crapped out.
B00C0ZNTGU|5|Exactly what I needed
B00FBOW814|5|Great!  Beats Toyota replacement price
B000C544X2|5|High quality better than OEM
B00VGCTNR2|4|Works well, but it's not very secure.
B0051PJWQW|5|Easy to use. Spray on a clean cloth and wipe the entire lens, walk away and let dry. After drying, the lens feels very smooth, like your car paint after waxing.
B00M90F1IK|5|Works great, fits a Prius steering wheel which is too small for most steering wheel covers. The textured surface is pleasant and stimulating to touch.<br /><br />The one thing to be aware of is that the color as shown on the web doesn't do justice to the EYE SEARING NEON of the real thing. (LCD phosphors can't show the full fluorescent near-UV glow.) It's eye catching even from the other side of tinted glass.<br /><br />I can't help thinking that people would probably prefer gray or black, though.
B001VYRKPM|5|It is practical way to cover the truck for a small value. It fits my vehicle perfectly.
B0067UCHTO|1|This is the right sensor, but it DOES NOT COME WITH THE PIGTAIL AS ADVERTISED.  Don't pay more for this one because you think you'll get the pigtail pictured and promised, get one of the cheaper ones.  You're going to have to get a pigtail separately anyways.
B004NEPE1E|5|Good
B000C7S4R2|4|I'm on lyrics giving this item a four star because the first one I got was damaged. However, when I received one in good condition, it worked great.
B000C39CL8|5|Very nice cooler for the price. It's recommended for old Hondas with the BAXA Transmission, which is what I have. On the car's 2nd tranny rebuild I bought this and had a transmission shop install it, and they said it was a very nice cooler and smart move. Hayden is a good brand. The cooler has been in a year, and no issues from it or the tranny.
B001DRG57Q|5|Works as a coolant sensor should at a great price, I'd buy again.<br />Installed on my 91 vette
B00K85H9F6|2|doesn´t fit on my dashboard.
B00P99KKAM|5|No problems fitting it on the wheel (1998 Ford Explorer). Cushy comfort, and stays cool in the sun. Arrived on time, with appropriate packaging.
B004CIB5D2|5|Cant go fast with a dirty little filter!
B00840JS5Q|5|Worked great on my company's 96 chevy. This kit coupled with a new PMD and located behind the front bumper (with a couple ventilation holes drilled) has eliminated the random dying the truck was experiencing. Good kit, plenty of cord to reach to the bumper with cord to spare.
B000WJEY8S|5|This is exactly what I wanted.  It was very easy to install and works like a charm.  I only wish  that I had gone with the one that could be reset, so I wouldn't have to right down the hours to keep track of when to change the oil.  I could have just reset the counter and waited for 50 hours change and reset again.
B00QQ52PT2|2|This item is NOT a direct replacement for a 94 -03 750 magna. I had to replacr the 3 wire plug with a male plug connector and trim down the bolt housings on the heat sink to make my bolt bracket reach thru far enough to get the nuts on. After mods it seems to work fine but not plug and play
B0022XTZO0|4|Good packaging, been holding up, I have purchased this brand for all my smaller batteries, seem to hold up, just be smart about it and make sure you don't have a drain on the system and take care of the machine and the batteries hold up.
B00RPBF1LU|5|Perfect fit,just what I needed
B000AP6RFM|5|We put K&N filters in all of our vehicles and are always very satisfied.  Performance is greatly improved and it's nice to never have to buy another filter.  We just purchase the cleaning kits and out filters last forever.  I highly recommend the K&N filter to everyone.
B00RBCB11M|4|I ordered this because i couldn't find original parts.  For the price it is great.  It works great on my 17 hp mower.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was that the choke was not compatible with the engine.  I knew a couple of tricks i learned from the Backwoods engineering school I attended and got out my drill and made a choke pulling device.  A one second pull and it is up and running like it was new.  It is 15 years old and it is running better than it has in years.  I used to have to run it with the choke on just to keep it going. I never expected it to do this well.
B0074DFMD6|1|I purchased this oil pan and yes it lined up and didn't have a problem installing it but I did run into a problem with this oil pan . The line that feeds from the oil pan to the turbo did not like up . The one that came stock on my car is faced top to bottom on the oil pan and I wasn't aware that this after market oil pan is slanted a bit sideways . So I had to make a compression tube in order to make that oil pan work . I also thought the drain plug is really cheap and my personal opinion I wouldn't recommend keeping the Allen wrench drain plug . It stripped pretty easy on me . Other than that it's an ok idem
B000TYFWY6|5|good working product
B003L2XPBK|5|just what i need it
B00KMR3J7M|5|This is a real plus for looks, it operates perfectly
B00D0R4ZH4|5|I love my key chain  and it arrived in a timely fashion. Thank you.
B005BNP7YU|5|Ram head lights up at night and is really noticeable.
B004I149TK|4|mount seemed a bit off, but fit.  Does not seem to go as &#34;deeply&#34; into the plastic bumper as the OEM light, but works otherwise.
B005CLMRE4|5|Very pleased
B00W5YK4BO|3|too tall, not wide enough.
B009OBW29S|5|excellent product at an excellent price...
B0049HS6HO|5|Ordered these for my Tahoe and they work perfectly
B00XVBHYXG|5|Looks great but needed gasket
B000NWA4F6|5|Just like the original!  Very easy to install and performed as intended.
B000BQSIWK|5|Works great, Glad I bought this!
B001GMFISA|5|Loving the look of my truck with these bars everyday.
B00IRBPCEI|4|It works
B006VN3GHY|5|Looked up a 5 minute &#34;How To&#34; video on YouTube, it took about 10 minutes to install. Easy.
B000IG1SDY|5|Great
B00MKD8KAW|5|Best purchase I have ever made!!!!!!!  Slide card in while car is off. Turn it on and you have a GPS system. Why pay 800.00 to the dealer? Shameful that they try to rob us. I love you Amazon.
B0070NNUQG|5|Excellent!! Factory quality, consistent tint and correct bulbs. Great value! Impressed.
B00R8LBVVQ|5|Excellent
B00GFZLPSK|5|Nice Lights
B00651CBO6|5|Looks great an works well.  I have a 92 F150 in great shape.  This is a nice addition.
B00M9ONVWY|1|This is garbage
B000COBXPA|5|Both came exactly as described and work perfectly.
B00OMZLK2G|5|What can I say, it's 100' of 16-gauge wire.
B004G5A7NU|5|Fast and strong - lifts one side of Hummer H2 with ease.
B00EUEJPSU|5|Item fit my 2015 Outlander like a glove. Installation took about 30 minutes, instructions were spot on. Excellent product
B00EIRAB78|5|Works great!
B009MJWZ9E|5|I like it it fits nice and looks cool.
B00GXZ6P8C|3|It is much more flimsy then I thought.. It needs to be almost twice as thick for the price they sell it for. I would not buy it again.
B000GKEZFK|5|OK
B001UL4ALS|5|Worked great!  Have now used this toll on over 10 clamps and all were crimped successfully.
B00G44KDCQ|5|Good price and GREAT customer service,  I would recommend this company. GREAT JOB AP PRODUCTS !!!  It does seem that the prices for the lights have gone up a lot since I last purchased. So I think I got a good deal
B008G1WT0Y|5|Perfect replacement headlight lens.  Easy to install, once I read up on how to remove the side lights and then the old lens.
B00D1CQVIY|3|Everything works well but I had to do a couple mods on the wire lengths especially the power wire what runs to the switch
B002YCDU7C|5|Great Product and fast delverly
B00LNJI1KI|5|Well worth the cash. So glad I purchased
B00S5ANUPO|5|it work well
B000IG5PZQ|5|Needed a clock for a piece of heavy equipment. Works great, and I'm not late for lunch 😋.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Bought these to replace my cargo light bulbs and reverse lights on my 2015 Chevy Colorado.<br /><br />These bulbs do a great job of throwing a nice, white light compared to the yellowish stock bulbs.  Ordered 2 sets (4 bulbs total) from JDM ASTAR's store and they all came 100% functioning.  From prior experience buying LED bulbs I know that sometimes you get bulbs that are DOA, but not the case for me.  These bulbs helped with nighttime reversing via my backup camera as well.<br /><br />At least for my application, the bulbs fit securely in the stock bulb sockets, so no fear of them falling out from vibration or bumps.<br /><br />I have had them on for 2 months and they are still working great.
B00KTIUG5C|5|they worked
B00KV8U20O|5|I got these for my 2000 Miata as one of my headlights had burnt out and I was looking for a good cheap replacement. These are great headlights that far exceeded my expectations. They are a nice crisp white light that offers great visibility. Will be buying again in the future.
B007USCM7E|5|Delivered before expected. Great product.
B000IY5Y9U|1|item did not fit perfectly had to cut to fit.
B00BK292TW|3|Ordered a medium and the jacket fits perfect over another jacket or by itself. The pants however are cut small and even looks like a small. Does not look like a medium pants. Wish I could order the pants separately .
B000KL1A2Q|5|Everything going so so far
B00KIF2UUK|1|Took over one month to arrive & didn't even fit in the car. They would have fallen right out as I drove away. Had to purchase another piece from another company. However, I will say the product did look nice. Just unable to be used on vehicle.
B0055F5050|5|Very nice
B00JODE8WA|5|Perfect for the wife to ride and relax now, great finish and product
B003YLH8QQ|4|Good product at a fair price
B00F0M7XZ8|4|Well made and sturdy.  Wouldn't necessarily want them for hard core rock sliders but for my simple off-road and camping needs I think they will hold up fine.  Initially had some fitting issues due to weak instructions included.  Finally took them to my professional, Knuckle Busters, in Mesa AZ.  They look great on '89 Cherokee now.
B0023VGRAG|5|Fit prefect and came on good timing!
B00480GYSA|3|White light for a few months but they get a bit yellow overtime. A little pricey. I would go with a plug and play HID kit instead. 5300k if you want OEM looking color temp
B0016KBS2C|4|Fits good easy to put on. Made a nice touch to the tailgate. A little expensive for plastic.
B00TO659I4|5|My 03 Mustang GT seems to like this stuff. I bought this oil as part of a high performance tune up I did on the car at 70,000 miles. This oil was a change from the normal Mobile1 I've used since buying this car with 36,000 miles on it a few years ago. I get sum flack from my buddies for buying premium oil and still changing it every 3000 to 4000 miles. However, I can honestly say that I do things with my car that most people don't. I drive it hard and fast and I meticulously maintain it myself. When I read the bottle of RP oil I got the sorta warm fuzzy feeling one might long for when reading the Mobile1 bottle. It also confirmed on the label, what I suspected: be sure to purchase a premium high performance oil filter when you buy this oil. The ingredients are designed to flow and clean like no other, so a proper filter to protect your engine from the contaminants that are likely to come loose with this RP oil is important. I installed a new KandN oil filter, and fuel filter along with new autolight spark plugs and a radiator flush and fill. Transmission flushed recently with Mobile1 ATF, and I advanced the spark and fuel pressure settings a tad on my Diablo-intune computer tuner tool. Let me tell you I was NOT disappointed! This oil may not be the whole reason my car suddenly feels awesomely more powerful, but I'm sure it don't hurt.
B00LZYROEU|5|I love the product!
B00144B26C|5|Complete multiple application coverage in one kit. I will stock THIS item and get rid of 3 other SKU's.
B00KHUQAY8|3|Really nice just the right amount of bling
B000E7FN5Q|4|Its  really just for looks and sound but it gets that big airbox out of my way
B000BPSVV4|5|Its always tough to get it on the wheel but works great
B0031XXW4O|5|Love it. Makes the shower seem twice as big.
B0074JUODS|5|Small, but powerful.  It works as advertised.....FANTASTIC !!
B002JBDH26|1|Would help if it was preassembled. Spending too much time trying to get spring, lever, and nut to go on. Seeing that this was NOT going to work, I just took the handle off the this part and put it back on the old assembly.  That, worked like a charm. I wasted at least nearly an hour fooling with that.  NOTE- SEND THESE OUT ALREADY ASSEMBLED.
B00PCHSMW4|5|I bought this for a July cross country RV trip because my back always sweats in the leather seat while the AC blows on me, freezing the front of me.  This product kept me comfortable for all 70+ hours of driving for over 4,100 miles.  It is a ventilated seat not a cooling seat, and if you understand that, you will be happy.  It does not cool you, but does something better: Ventilation!  It keeps you comfortable without letting you get too hot or too cold.  If you sit in it with a sweaty back, you quickly cool off as your shirt dries and then you are comfortable again.  Don't buy this expecting it to make you completely comfortable if you do not have AC.  If you have AC, then you will be completely comfortable.<br /><br />It installed quick and easy (in and RV with a high mounted seat) and is relatively quiet.  It does make noise, but it as quiet and as effective as any standard OE version in any luxury car that I have driven.
B00FF1K7BQ|4|Only have used the Leather.. Pretty good scent, 2 squirts over back floor mat. Do it the night before you drive the car.
B007GRGWDY|5|WOW! worth every penny! We just took a 100 mile or so ride after installing these and all I can say is , they are great! Bike handles much better and no bottoming out. I got the heavy duty springs and they are just perfect. We ride pretty hard for two old folks.
B0016IMQHU|4|Works well for about 1-2 years and then burns out.  This is the 3rd unit in 4 years.
B0014BEDF2|1|I check to see if it fit my Mazda and it said it did but it didn't .. Waste of time and money
B000C5G42G|5|Perfect fit, easy to install.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Hi.Thank you for my order.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Love them....they come off easy for the occasional drive thru restaurant ,,,,
B00GSAUHB8|3|I guess the sun shade works somewhat. It is easy to use and convenient to store, but I don't agree that it reduces the temperature 39% as stated on the you tube video. A vehicle can easily reach temperatures of 120', 39% collet means that it would stay at 73'. I haven't experienced this result yet.
B00897OSRM|5|Cool
B001C6OYGM|5|Nice build quality and a direct bolt in on a 2007 accord 2.4
B00JHEG7UW|4|4 stars because one of my headlights keeps going out... The bulb keeps burning the ballast or something... I've gone through 3 ballasts and this bulb stays on and after a couple drives it burns out again. I love the way they look, definitely my best kit I've owned but there's something wrong going on. When I changed my headlights to H1 is when I started having this problem. I used to have 9006 and I had them for over a year and never had a problem with them.
B000CFPCBA|4|Fits the car and works.  Not much more to be said.
B0058J4NLU|1|Product doesn't fit my 2013 chevy silverado. My dad has a 2009 and it's the same problem. The back up light hole  is too small for installation. Line up pins are not designed for this model as well. Not to mention that you can't even contact the seller. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
B000C5E0CC|4|Would of got 5 stars but bearing made in China, working OK
B0057NWCG0|4|fits perfect
B00TEG1IWK|5|Quality product
B000CAZ5LM|5|good price
B001UL0E2M|5|Perfect fit on my 1983 GL1100 Interstate.
B0038F8SYE|5|very pleased with this stool, it is sturdy and well built will be used a lot by my son in his shop. Sears has always had good product
B0073H8564|5|It worked just great and was sent to me on a timely manner.<br />Thank you<br />Leslie Allwhite
B008NMHDKC|5|just got mine mounted the engine  running just good no more weird sound from the muffler I will recommend this .
B00AB2PBU6|3|The material is thin and the black coloring begins to fade after some exposure. Invest an extra 10 dollars and get yourself some descent real car seat covers.
B00C7YTP3K|5|all pistons weighed within 2 grams quality parts and service
B000GTUM9O|5|I ain't eeeeveeer gonna sell this bike! too pretty
B00ZS8ES0W|5|Boat was MISSING cup holders (only had the holes) There were 6 missing... Just what I needed. I painted them one of the colors of the Boat and they FIT and turned out Perfect
B00YWCB1FK|5|I ordered the German Shepherd Clear Decal Sticker and I am extremely impressed with the quality and vibrant colors of the Decal. It was easy to install and did not peel off the window like others which I have previously purchased. It is clearly visible and I have received several compliments from other owners of German Shepherds. My husband and I have purchased this decal for both of our vehicles. I highly recommend this item to those wishing to caution inquisitive strangers who tend to approach a vehicle without warning or to those who simply wish to boast the fact that they are travelling with a magnificent breed.
B00MBPT0F8|5|Excellent alternative to steel wool; use before the grey scuff pads to remove deeper scratches from stainless steel; then use the grey scuff pads to restore original brushed stainless finish.
B001P2HWC6|3|So far really great quality. Will probably be great ONCE WE GET PINS FOR IT. THIS DID NOT COME WITH PINS. I'm now on the hunt to Home Depot with my husband for pins or bolts. My own nightmare.
B00CD6FPEK|5|They work &#34;awesome&#34; !!!!
B000A8FJ12|5|Added some horsepower good product.
B00M9IH8JC|5|Fit right where the old one was  with no problems .
B000GD5FMY|3|lenses are  ok but the arms are too short
B00BFDGL4K|1|DO NOT BUY!!!! You can not program it!!! I thought I would save money by buying this online. No I ended up spending a while lot more instead of saving money. I am so upset. This key is not made by Honda, but rather by some cheap shop in China and you can't program it with you honda car!!! Grrrr!!!
B000GTJ5I8|5|Great tool, works as it should, no problems.  I'd recommend this product for all inner coil spring compressions.  I've the hook type and they are really dangerous, this one is definitely the way to go.  I compressed my front coil springs (for a 66 Comet) to 12 inches with no issues.  Don't get me wrong, I still was very cautious and handled the compressed springs very carefully, like one of the other users said, &#34;like old dynamite.&#34;  I've attached a couple pics, hope they come out clear.
B000HAB7G4|5|Perfect for wooden truck bed
B00D3RS64E|1|Kit does not come with barrel style terminals as pictured.  It came with crimp style terminals.  The description and picture are wrong.
B00029XEEI|5|I've got quite a few of these and they always work!
B000EDOSME|5|So far it looks great although not installed yet...  I was reading other reviews on people looking for a big Allen wrench for tightening the hose connection.  Here's a little trick to get it done without the Allen wrench.  Just use a 1/4&#34; bolt with 2 jam nuts.
B00V2RVAAE|5|Great fit and grip
B000GKD722|5|Sanded the breads on the rims and then used this to seal the tire to the wheel.  Works wonderful.  Also worked great for sealing pruned limbs on my fruit trees.
B000M5W25E|5|Great product
B00XWCS8DE|5|these are for low side not hi side
B00L8VZXIY|5|work as advertised, truck stops quickly even with heavy 22&#34; wheels on it
B010RTGIQI|5|What a great, ingenious product.  It has saved me bunches of money. The folks responsible for these small wonders should receive a medal.  Thank you.
B002G2261G|5|Works
B00KUL6X8M|5|Perfect... works as expected.  Very satisfied.
B00CG0IXCE|3|it's fine with the price
B003IS3HV0|4|Does the job, but not mind blowing.
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|Our neighbor had an old car that he was considering junking.  I asked him if the batter worked and he said it hadn't worked for years.  I asked if he would let me try out this new product I received to sample through Amazon and he obliged.<br /><br />First of all, this whole unit fits inside my glove box, which is awesome.  It is small and cute enough for a woman to use and not feel intimidated.<br /><br />The unit is not difficult to use at all.  Simply clamp red to red and black to black, turn on the battery pack and then turn on the car.  The old car started up immediately.<br /><br />I was really surprised by how well it worked, and I suggest if you are driving around with an older model car, you purchase this unit and stick in your trunk, because you never know just when you might need it.
B000CKOVSK|4|As described

B00D6NC5TW|5|Stays
B0085IFXI8|5|It's an clear angled sewer fitting, not much to say.  But, it does allow you to tell when the tanks are drained and clear.  It also fits in the rear bumper of my RV with the hose attached which was important to me. I bought it to replace my old NON-clear fitting that was leaking.  This is much better!
B00DVWK7YI|5|gave it to my middle granddaughter's mother with instruction that she give it to her daughter at an appropriate time.
B000CFAV7A|5|sleek
B008LMOM9O|5|Turns heads.<br />Small yet eye catching on my Jeep Wrangler.
B000GUWLJC|5|nice set.  great price.
B00GSGVVTO|5|Fit Nicely<br />Sealed even better than my Original Tailgate Seal.<br />Definitely getting the matching Door Set.
B00KHUQ6L0|1|This is 100% man made material. The cover ripped when I was putting it on. It is a wast of money.
B00KLZ65GM|3|Cut to high, to much black is showing so you have to fold it so the skull looks right. Pretty thin and more for show. But gor the money, really shoukdnt complain. Lol
B000C9N8G2|5|just like the original
B0048J05C2|5|Review is for a Honda CR-V driver's window motor.  It installed just like the Honda original. No problem with the auto door locks or the auto-down feature. Works just like the original. I expect to keep this CR-V for years, so I will update my review if I encounter any problems with durability.
B004GC2E16|5|Look great.
B004UM93HU|5|Great price. Fast shipping. Thank you
B000KL32YU|4|Works great on my boat and self-stores.
B009XIOZ4C|5|These fit perfect and were made from gasket material about 1/32&#34; thick. Good price and fast shipping. These fit both HD 5spd and Ultima 6spd trap door.
B00WXBYYR4|5|Great product, name brand, and half the price of the cheapest local store. Great shipping time too.
B001BCK984|4|The unit is a perfect match and easy to install. The mirror vibrates a little bit when you are idling at a stoplight. Otherwise it is fine.
B0066PI154|5|I have a Volvo, and if any reviewers have worked on their own Volvos, they know they can be a real pain.  There was absolutely no clearance around the inner tie rod to get a wrench, pipe wrench, or file.  I rented a tie rod tool from a local auto parts store.  The flats were too wide, and would not fit on the grips.  I had just about given up when I decided to visit Amazon.  This tool saved me from having to reassemble the outer tie rod and pay a shop to do a relatively simple job.  One quick note:  this fits a 3/8 drive.  Most breaker bars are going to be 1/2 inch (if you're using a breaker bar, you're going to be placing a lot of torque on the tool, and 1/2 can withstand more).  If you're removing an old, stuck on inner tie rod, you'll likely be using a breaker bar.  Just note that if you don't have a 3/8 breaker bar, you may want to order an adaptor when you order this.
B000CIT3N0|5|No better oil, no better filter. The engineers at ExxonMobil are the world's best.
B009NOZ4NW|2|not very bright
B00LC82GZQ|5|Works perfectly. Instructions were super easy to follow. Literally took me 5 seconds to program. Buying another as a spare!
B009MASYRA|4|The C-Max has a huge front window that my old shade wouldn't come close to fitting.  This shade fits perfectly and helps a lot.  But, like many of the other purchasers, I agree that it is big and bulky - but the window it big so what do you do?  Deal with it.  This product is a perfectly fine product and has quality - it isn't their fault that the C-Max front window is huge and needs a big shade.
B007NEUZUQ|5|Great product. Durable material. Only way to improve would be if the screws were black but a little touch up paint and it's perfect!
B008CE06ZA|5|very nice hitch and just what I needed, well made and heavy duty ...added t3 receiver lock and hitch clamp
B000JZFV8C|4|I just purchased a 2005 Durango with the 5.7 Hemi so I bought this kit. The instructions could have been much better. For example, &#34;Step 6 - Unclip the engine wire harness from the resonator box as shown&#34; is unnecessary on an '05 Durango, they could have mentioned that. I often had to refer to the main exploded diagram to fill in information that is omitted in the individual steps. Also, the silicone crank case hose is at least 1&#34; too short - even without fully seating it there is a restrictive bend, I'll have to purchase a longer one, and maybe an elbow connector to make up for the sharp turn it has to make. I took advantage of the exposed throttle body intake during the install to give it a nice cleaning.
B005VWRAIC|5|Easy to install, the door works pefectly ones again.
B00BZLPC0G|5|great product
B00DX8AVEQ|5|Works as well as the factory bumper
B000C1JWJW|5|Thanks!
B007Z4X1Q4|5|easy install. shipped quick. great fit and finish
B00864NGX0|4|The cover fits well and still looks really nice after 18 mos of use.  My only problem is that there's a cut out (approx 3&#34; square) on the top of the dash for something that some models have but mine doesn't.  When I contacted the company because I thought they'd sent me one for a different model, they insisted that the year and model I gave them showed it having a cut out.  I ended up having to get some black cloth to cover the cut out to keep that area from the sun but otherwise I like the cover.  If it hadn't been for the problem with the cut out section, I would have given 5 stars.
B00JREPRJE|5|as described
B00GBRG4TC|5|perfect fit.. great price
B001UOUM6W|5|Just like factory mirrors
B00PGCDFH2|5|Easy to Install, fit good and look good
B001S8EC2K|5|factory replacement and it works
B00EHE851Q|5|Pre-assembled in the box so that installation on the rails was a piece of cake.  The installation took 10 minutes and looks great!  Now my roof top rack is really functional.  Without these cross bars, the rack is just for looks.
B00PGK2CXM|4|Arrived promptly and worked!
B001GF7M18|5|I have a 2015 Toyota Tacoma TSS and it fits the windshield perfectly.
B004T1BZ8W|4|Used part but very good
B001BNHY1S|5|They do the job great. Not as fancy as weathertechs, but also not $130 a pair! Very happy with the purchase.
B000CPCS80|4|I bought this for my daughters car to help save her tire and rims from scrapping the curb and It helped. I replaced almost brand new tire that was damaged from hitting the curb. So far after installing it, I haven't seen any new scratches. Four stars because the spring rusted and broke after awhile. I replaced it with the springs that harbor freight sells, those $0.99 magnetic pickup tool. It's about 2 ft long so it is enough to replace 2 rods.
B004PEZ2ZK|5|Work perfectly
B002ZPFZ94|4|very good
B0002Q81W6|1|Does not fit
B00SOP3T06|5|Nice product for Mercedes Benz Sport models especially in black
B00B0C0TCQ|2|Installed on 2010 charger R/T with road and track, stock 20&#34; chrome clad. Nice upgrade over stock. Feel Great!<br /><br />** UPDATE** rotors warped within a few months. Thought it was something loose on the front suspension until I went with new solid rotors and powerstop red pads. No more wheel shake on braking.  I hear most slotted/ drilled rotors warp. I would stick to solid rotors unless you are at the track every day.
B00VB8BIP6|2|quality is ok but how do you install the letters in the grill ?<br />not a simple attachment to the grill, a real hassle, also the threaded bolt does not go in deep enough, some type of glue to make sure the threaded bolt does not come off the back of the letters is needed.
B004MDEV38|4|I thought I was man enough to mount this thing on my 2006 Honda Odyssey, but I was wrong. I spent far too long cleaning out the weldnuts and working the tap back and forth...in the end, I wasn't able to supply enough torque to mount it properly. I brought it to a local U-Haul and for $30 they went after it with an impact gun and installed it in ten minutes.<br /><br />Since then, though, it's been extremely solid--exactly what I was looking for.
B00NB808P0|5|&#34; fills the bill &#34; .
B0040CX36M|5|Worked well for 98 Dodge Caravan.
B006G3KUYQ|5|1996 Toytoa camery they fit great
B003CR2ILM|5|On time shipment and product was complete with all parts.
B000GBIQ36|5|snap to install
B002L1DD3M|4|Meets my expectations
B004J00GII|1|does not fit 2015 ultra limited
B004BTMGS0|5|Correct part and delivered on time<br /> Awesome price
B002UD0GGS|5|good stuff
B010Q4PWCK|3|Not as bright nor stand out like they show in the ad........  To expesive for the size, quality and print brightness.....
B00353PWAW|5|Excellent product and it does just what it says on the label.
B00JR4D70K|4|Two months in ,so far good , I fixed loose rain guard.
B006MX8196|1|Do not use for Jeep Patriot! More work that it's worth. Front seats fit okay. The head rest covers look like crap and really cheap. Cheaper than what you play for it. The rear seat covers are impossible to install no matter what instructions you follow.  You will have to cut the product to make it look some what good but makes it invalid to return. The finish product look is not worth the headache and aggravation.  Pay more for a better product and less of a hassle.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very nice. I am amazed it can squish down into a small circle.  Buy a jumbo one for a minivan, this one is a tad small--I am still using it but would prefer a larger one
B00LAHMQF4|3|I would like this a lot better if it was not made in China. I bought this to replace the frame that came with the bike, from Barnett's in El Paso, that got broken in an accident. It looks ok, but I'm not sure it's going to stay on the bike. I might just get a new plate and ditch the frame.
B0016IDE12|5|Awesome item great price
B000C9SR90|5|very good
B007M2Y1FE|3|Not what I was expecting - but we used it anyway<br />Fast shipping
B00DZUCPXW|5|Worked well to allow me to install stock Jeep rims on a trailer axle.
B00DLIL2FA|2|Mat slides around on floor. Shows scuffs and marks even right after cleaning. Flimsy and not what I expected based on description. I could have gotten a much better quality product for same price by buying in auto store. Item was shipped fast and without damage.
B007N3P9DA|4|Works wel,! Used it on my trip to Moab, UT and was able to take on more obsticles than I was on my previous trip without it. Takes a few days to break in; as the first few days the locker would bind up the axle and make a loud pop, but that pretty much went away except for the occasional time I'm turning hard into a parking space or something similar. I also added heavier gear fluid to the diff to help with that was well.
B001OMRF7Y|5|Fits well. does what its supposed to.
B0057ZQJ12|5|goods product fast delivery
B003SZ3COU|5|Excellent delivery speed and good quality part. I highly advise piercing gge upper boot and spraying light oil into the  main housing, then using silicone on the boot to deal the opening. This should preclude loss of travel due to corrosion.
B004GCXV5O|4|Good product
B000BYGGMG|4|used the wires before good stuff! Just wish they resisted pulling the wire off the plug terminal a little better.
B000IEZENQ|4|Easy to install. Holds on tight. No crack in product. I would recommend to anyone. As in other reviews some morons said the achohol running pad strips the paint. Don't listen to them. My car is white and after wiping it clean it was almost full black.. It takes WAY stronger solvent to take paint of, as I would know since I did auto painting for two years. Buy the product.
B00GUYCNMS|5|Does work perfectly, easy to install,
B00L8FLX7K|3|Item arrived quickly, mounting threads on one of studs not correct for mirror stem. Mounting hardware junk. Used my own mounting bolts and washers. Chrome looks weak and may pit or peel. Mirrors look sharp and appear sturdy. Seller shipped quick. Good price but u get what u pay for
B0002JMSHW|5|Worked Great on my 2011 Camaro 2 SS with the annoying Master Cylinder Cap always wanting to Leak!
B00DU0UWO6|2|Back seat cover doesn't fit 1992 Beretta. Material will singe with ash from cigarette
B008JYXYNY|5|If not for my Loopo, would probably go without a seatbelt at all. The shoulder belts are so uncomfortable, and Loopo is the best gadget I ever found!
B00IIWJLO8|5|work perfectly buying some for my son son:s truck
B00IUVN4SQ|5|It works. Fine. That was what needed
B00C2FKPCY|5|Helped me with lots of problems so far and I own a 2010 Chrysler Town And Country. OK so far I love this particular unit works wonders has helped me pass inspection a few times already and has saved me thousands the steelier  dealers would have charged me. Gives me Live Data I am able to view while driving coolant temperature the cat temperature the o2 sensors and many more a great diagnostic piece of equipment. You can even run some tests freeze frame erase codes and most importantly properly diagnose your vehicle if you have a newer can running CAN network than you need this especially if you are like me and purchased a new LEMON CHRYSLER MINIVAN.I am very happy with my purchase many options and you can even update this unit when they have a new update for i. This procedure is very simple read the instructions it came with trust me you will be happy. If anyone has any questions just ask I am here to help if I can. Please also note I am not telling you to drive and look at this unit as a distraction because it would be illegal it is equivalent to someone texting on a phone so please use caution have someone in the passenger seat relay readings to you. UPDATE: 8/14/2016 Thank god I made this purchase today I was set up for a emissions inspection coincidental as I started the vehicle in the morning I get a charm buzzer going off then the check engine light so I put this bad boy on and found emissions code for a small leak  P0442 which is Evaporation System Malfunction, Small Leak detected. I checked all I could and at the time also smelled gas vapor went followed the smell found a loose gas cap tightened the gas cap erased the code drove around for a while it's been 3 weeks now and code did not come back and in between had about 6 fill ups of gas and no code today I will have to call dealer to set up another inspection appointment. If the dealer took the car in as is I would have paid a $150.00  diagnostic fee then they would have installed a new gas cap costing $50.00 with labor --LMAO--- a fee of $278.00 in all this is how much I just saved by purchasing this unit still love it thank you OTC.  Chrysler Lemon
B00C7UP3XK|2|Very tough to install. Had to cut some plastic pieces to make it fit. cheap powder coating that chips very easy. doesnt feel that study.
B0060A76B0|5|Easy to instal
B00I0W1EDW|5|Worked perfectly on my 2012 C6.
B00B81780K|5|Fit very nice. Easy to install.
B00EDFM6R8|5|This is the second set I have ordere since I didn't want to buy all that I needed before I knew how they worked. A little whiter than the standard incandescent bulb, but plenty bright, cool to the touch when lit, and a huge savings in power usage. Great bulbs!
B0068ESNGU|5|I have a 2005 sportser and I've been in the market for a bag but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for bags!! Afte much debate I went ahead and purchased this bag and I Love it! I have a low profile single seat so I was worried about how tight it would fit around my fender! It fit great!! Very tight and it's a pretty good size! I love that I can make it bigger with a quick unzip of the zipper! I can even fit my purse in it and I don't have a really small purse either!! I love being able to bring my purse with me or if I need to pick up something at the store I now can ride my bike to the store by I have a little storage now!! I am soo please with this product and would definitely recommend it! It's very functional and it also looks nice on my Harley!!!
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Work great
B00LCD8ITO|4|Nice, very practic to put and happy
B001U75RY6|5|Little  smaller  than I expected  overall good quality
B00E1ETJNU|1|Not a good product for MN plates. The bottom of the frame is too wide and covers up a large portion of the month and year tabs. Note you only get 1 frame for that price..
B00LSTE2SS|4|Delivered promptly. Good quality product.
B0030I05ZO|1|Inside bearing wrong size. Check your needs before ordering.
B00AWMRKVS|5|RE: the sizing - most of the reviews below are saying that these run small, and that 5'8&#34; 170lb people are wearing the M/L.  Not sure how, but I'm a 5'10&#34; 190lb dude with a 34/36 waist and the M/L were huge on me, dragging on the ground and stepping all over them, so I went with the XS/S.  The waist is admittedly small for me, but the elastic makes them fit fine and not snug or uncomfortable at all.  They are perfect over regular (not skinny) jeans.  And yes, on my bike (Triumph Bonneville) they fit great and don't ride up.  I wear high boots with the jeans tucked in to keep things from getting wet.  So the moral of the story here is that you should probably try them on in a store as sizing reports are all over the place and your tastes may be different for baggy vs. tight fit.  They are a common find in many of the shops in the Seattle area.
B000K03U48|4|Worked fine
B00E0FRZJK|3|Seem like a durable jacket but the sizing system is all messed up and didn't fit properly
B00PFDB0NS|4|Shipped promptly.  It fitted my car perfectly, so far it is working fine.
B000EPVQBI|5|Works good, as described, good service.
B00AMKNA28|4|I love the way it looks on my 675r the carbon fiber just pops! Looks great while giving that added protection.. Only thing that bugs me  just a little bit is the little air bubble that came up right above the triumph logo other then that its perfect
B00ELHT3PG|5|everyone  will love it if try one time and came back buy it for sure, thanks.
B00RIIINO2|4|They are brighter than the 12 v incandescent light they replace.  If you turn them on in bright sun you probably won't know they are on.  The plastic seems sturdier than the OEM lights (I don't know the brand)  The integrated lens/LED light is easy to snap on and off but should do OK when scraped against branches lightly.  The base raises the light about 3/8&#34; which I view as a downside.,  I'd rather see a really flush mount.  The the base is mostly flat with a channel for the hot wire.  It was tricky for me to get the pigtail for the light and the two hot wires (in and out from the light grommet in the camper).  If the base were more hollow, it would be easy to mount, or if there were fittings to insert the an outgoing &#34;hot&#34; it would be a big better.  All in all I like it and I will buy another for a spare.  It's a lot better than the incandescent fixtures the camper came with.
B004MDEVBU|5|works great
B0002NYBC8|3|I seems to me that the product did not flow from the can because it is not pressurised and therefore it didnt make any change in my AC so finally i did buy a can from autozone that comes pressurized and fix the problem.
B007AAUTG8|5|Great backup camera for my Scooter Lift & Go.
B001CF5D18|5|if you are any kind of a mechanic it installs in 45 minutes! yes  the top bolts ARE  a little hard to get to but.... either paysomeone or do aint big deal
B00PQNZILM|4|Cool sticker looks good on my gas tank door  slight bubbles hope it lasts
B003UWTJ2A|5|This product is durable and provides a nice sheen to tires and trim in a cost effective manner. It does not leave a high gloss finish, so if that is your taste buy something else.
B004GEPCBS|5|good solid product. would recommend it.
B00EDY7DUY|5|Gift for a person who loves wolves and feels they are her spirit animal. She loved it and its on her car
B00N675IZQ|5|excellent item
B002LGQMC6|5|Excellent product and high quality fit perfectly and works great
B00144B32A|5|A boating friend recommended marine Spray nine . I tried it and really like it. Good on about everything related to boat<br />Cleaning. I wish someone could explain the difference between marine spray nine and spray nine . The marine is harder to find, but not sure what the difference is.
B00JQYNMRY|2|whoah, $22? don't order this unless you have no choice. it sells for $8 and change in RV shops.
B002QPV40M|5|good product
B008B23B28|5|Bought this helmet after many hours on an overnight and after 3days of wearing it this has become my primary helmet! This helmet is so lightweight comfortable and extremely aerodynamic.  Romping at higher speeds there is zero head bobble from the wind it's quiet and has plenty of ventilation.  On cooler mornings it's warm as well with the cloth mesh near the chin preventing air from getting up in the helmet and vents closed I'll be wearing this far into the fall until there is ice on the ground! I highly suggest buying this helmet and it fits great!
B000AY4O9Y|5|Ok value. Daughter wanted for her car.
B0014B5TAA|5|Excellent upgrade for any fox body build !!
B00FC223N8|5|this is very good  I recomend
B00G27LHYS|1|Great looks.  Poor material.
B00B88Y8Y2|5|Not as bright as the Harley version, but hey - it's a fraction of the price.  Spend $300 if you want really bright LEDs, or go with this if you want to save a lot of money.  They work great for the price.
B0027UO7PU|5|Easy to install and works great on my 2010 Rancher. Upgraded the fairlead with the KFI and all is good.
B002MO9OYA|3|THIS IS *NOT* the actual light, but just the replacement reflector.
B00TT6DIQY|2|Definitely not worth it. 2 stars only because it looks like the picture. Flimsy plastic with stickers on it, I doubt it will last 6 years like it states. I can peel it with my fingernails. The L on top of the E is slightly off so you can see the orange underneath. It just looks amature. I don't think I'm even going to put it on my car. Just not worth what it cost. Shipping was though priority mail, definitely shouldn't have cost $5.99.
B00RW7X1QE|1|When I turn my wipers on, seems like they are coming off. Makes a lot of noise
B00771WT8Q|5|brake pads fit my 2001 yamaha warrior 350
B0068O20MS|1|Complete junk! They're not even white!!! They are some horrid bluish-grey color! The numbers/letters aren't even crisply printed... They are &#34;fuzzy&#34; around the edges as if printed on an old ink jet printer from the 1990s.  I was also expecting the km/h values to be in red, as in one of the pictures...no such luck.
B000IOONEC|5|Wife ordered this for her 2008 Harley Nightster. Bike has solo seat and this trims the look very nicely on the metallic blue.
B00KZD8ME8|5|Learned about this at the Infiniti Q50 forum. Easy to install and looks GREAT.
B0013RIOMK|5|Looks great<br />Tight Fit.<br />I highly suggest these to all Wrangler owners.
B00T47K604|1|It's coming from China and doesn't fit a Honda Odyssey.
B004107292|4|Great product and value!
B006LJA63U|5|Really easy to install and fit well.
B000C1Q68M|5|So far so good, installed these pads on a 2001 Honda Civic LX Sedan.
B004K6HZFS|5|Started the first pull
B000OV7DG4|5|Works
B000C9WLBA|5|I use these for two Victory motorcycles(2005 and 2012), and remove the sticker for esthetics. I do not use a wrench, nor pre-fill the filter. I swipe the gasket and threads with old oil from the drain pan before hand-tightening. The Walmart filter is identical (7317), at 1/3 the WIX cost.  There is no such animal as a &#34;motorcycle&#34; filter, nor &#34;motorcycle&#34; oil. Same with the 20# battery--the sticker is placed at the yuasa factory:  $150 for a Harley sticker, $100 for a Kawasaki Jetski sticker, and $75 for a Walmart sticker.  It is exactly the same battery.
B00QJLMKU2|4|Is it original?<br /><br />If would I add Bluetooth  obd I can?
B00MB0EDMS|5|i love them!!!!!!!!! they fit my vw beetle!!!!!
B007TKLBMA|5|this cover has a good fit on our camper. the material has a strong feel. I think this cover will last for quite a while.
B00QPV8B22|5|These brushes not only look great, but the perfect size for clearing and snow from car windows. The brushes are made from quality materials and look like they'll hold up for years. The foam grips also help prevent brushes from slipping out of your grasp when snow is between your hand and the brush. Overall great design and excellent quality!
B004GE3MNS|4|Great in every way but one: Photo and description shows grille as grey, but arrived as unpainted black plastic. Had to spend an extra couple of days prepping and painting (which added about $25 bucks to the cost), but in the end, it looks and fit great.
B003UVCY00|5|Have bought lots of these for gifts to family living in the Caribbean. We have had ours for at least four years now, but we just use around our house. Our family uses their in sea environment and ocean fishing, no complaints!!
B000XJRYQ6|5|Best on earth
B0001DUJAW|5|Used to spray paint some ceiling tile that had discolored. Super easy. Looks great!
B006H34BUY|3|I expected it to hold the dust like a swiffer.  It doesn't do that, but it is great for carrying in the car.
B00FPL10WQ|5|works and fits nicely
B007H2SIKS|4|It is reasonably well crafted, and my only disappointment perhaps is that the gauge of the original piece was heavier. That may be a function of having been built a long time ago. It is attractive and fits well enough.
B00HVRTX6C|3|grill is good quality. screws are junk that come with
B000SXCLIS|5|I Like the thick durable material. Protects my harley from the extreme heat and the rain, being its parked outside.
B00ADO9GJY|4|there bulbs enough said
B00306YESK|1|One glove was smaller than the other. Used 4 hours and had 2 holes.  I know they don't cost much but wouldn't pay a penny for another set
B00OPMIR2M|4|Excellent tool for maintaining the CORRECT pressure. It's amazing how far off my el cheapo &#34;gauge&#34; was. My only criticism is the material this is made from, it is hard plastic that feels very cheap and seems like it would be easy to break if you ever dropped it or something.
B000CKPD64|5|timely response, then the old one resumed working. Will keep it for future replacement.
B005CLN6VC|2|like others have said.  it does not line up well.  You will need to watch a youtube video to see the  best way to get this thing to work.  Overall i would rather spend the money here and do it myself then to spend 80ish dollars at my local car parts store.
B00QFHIX5G|3|Bought one locally and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't charge fresh out of the package.  Inner fuse was blown. I am buying a new one today, think it will resolve the problem but just wanted to put it out there in case someone has a similar problem.
B000C2O9QM|1|Motor I receievd had been opened, and missing half of the mounting bolts!  Had greasey hand prints all over it and the instructions.  I am going to have to go to home depot to buy mounting bolts for it and the fan blade, since its a different thread pitch that came on my OEM fan.  So, I can't give this anything more than a 1 star review because it appears someone sent it back, and they just resold it without even looking at it.
B00AWYBKK8|5|Make my Civic look amazing,  and easy installation an A+
B004OK4T2M|5|Good buy looks nice.
B000P0ZJIS|5|Worked great on b-series head
B005BT90DI|3|didn't work very well
B000C42SQ8|3|Might or might not be a good stabilizer, does not fit a 2000 Suburban 2500, which uses a &#34;jeep&#34; style stabilizer that already has the mounts.
B0083W16SM|5|Excellent!
B000KKF6L8|5|They kept my wheels on!
B007TY59TM|5|As good as OEM. Easy to install, works well. Switch was wired with polarity backwards needed to be changed
B003TPUOEK|4|Works fine.
B00KPQVZMQ|5|Quick delivery at a good price !!!
B00OTZ2QZE|5|Yes it was perfect fit thank you
B00BOVDCPE|5|Excellent
B003CGH13S|5|Fits perfect

B00NQD21AK|4|Wasn't the exact one for my Trailblazer but got the job done
B000S2SKIY|5|working very good thank
B00CPN0BB8|1|Came silver plain looked like a peice of aluminum foil with one side sticky never recommend to anyone
B003WOXOD6|1|I should have known better, I bought this as a recommended add-on when I bought the &#34;backpack&#34; for my truck (which I love), but this things isn't worth the money.  Anyone carrying a pair of sharp scissors can cut the cable.
B000N9V8Q8|5|Worked great. 1990 Bayliner Capri 2050 CX
B000LNBLTK|5|Perfect! Works as intended and no brakage on dashboards now!
B00Q4O1HQC|4|I love these and wear them everyday. Very well made with thick material that makes you feel protected. They come with knee armor and have pockets to add your own hip armor. If you take the knee armor out, they are relatively comfortable to wear all day.  They are a bit of a challenge to get on and off since they are double lined and they are skin tight. They are not super breathable if you're wearing them in hot climate. Note ***  I am usually a 6-8 in pants and I couldn't even get the size 8 over my leg.  I do have muscular legs, so if you do, make sure you go a size or 2 up from what you usually get. Overall I love them though and will definitely by more.
B005N6WXYM|5|Works great for my jeep xj. Homemade cowl intake
B0009YDQEO|5|Very good value, received sooner than expected
B007GRSIZ4|5|I got these thicker 39mm cheekpads for my size small Neotec (comes with 35mm pads) and they make the helmet fit more snugly which is what I wanted. It's a subtle difference in size, but it makes a huge different in fit. Same quality and color as the original cheekpads.
B000BGHYDO|3|This is a good product but MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT ALL THE WAY INTO THE TANK BEFORE turning on the water. This will spray you in the face with sewer water if not. Works well but just be careful unless you like to wear sewer water..
B00TFQ6DEW|2|It does not stay on the armrest on my Paceman. The elastic band in front slides right off - totally useless. NOT RECOMMENDED
B00493V684|5|OIL PRESSURE GAUGE WORKS AGAIN. THANKS FRED PFIESTER
B000C9DQMI|2|Fairly good made in china !!
B0060ZEPRI|5|Very nice matches my steering wheel
B00DOZC26I|2|They do not fit over my glasses, they sit on the top of my no rim glasses. Only buy if your glasses are very small and fit close to your face.
B002OP74CG|5|Excellent Windshield. Easy Installation and looks great!
B00BD4SLV2|1|Tag on the outside. Not well crafted.
B000E4JK76|5|Worked perfect, and fit just like OEM.
B00NB7UZCM|4|Really like the saying but the mylar, even though I carefully smoothed it out, still did not come out completely clean.  I had to work with the &#34;c&#34; in 'could' as it tore.
B012MZGKOU|5|The Etek Wifi Wireless OBD2 diagnostic tool is a great little gadget to have in every home. Every vehicle I have owned I experienced the same issue at one point. Where a warning light would appear, I would make an appointment and take it to the dealer. Once I arrive the warning light goes off and they said there is nothing I can do unless the warning light is on at the time. Now this is where this baby comes in handy. Plug this into the outlet that is typically where all the fuses are, drivers side, under the steering wheel behind the little door. I have an android OS phone (Galaxy Note 4) I joined the Wifi called WiFi_OBDII.  I downloaded the Torque software from the play store. there is a lite version and a full version for $4.99.<br />Once you are connected, software installed and Torque running you can do a bunch of stuff. You can leave it plugged in or ug it in when you want to run a scan. It can capture metrics when you are driving.acceleration such as the throttle, how fast you are going, boost, coolant level. there is a graphing feature that can capture stuff suck as RPMs, Absolute Throttle, Acceleration, Air Fuel Ratio.I did receive this scanner for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. In my opinion this is a high quality diagnostic tool, it works extremely well, easy to use.
B00B0ZBJB8|4|Great item. Fits perfectly. Excellent quality.
B004HCM9H4|5|Goes on easy..... Comes off easy. Great shine.
B00029WSW2|5|Good size. Easy to increase view. You may have to install new base. I glued it to my original base.
B001W443FQ|5|Awesome. I hate the &#34;All Weather&#34; floor mats.
B00R6ZX342|5|as expected
B00OZXBVL0|5|😊
B000ID0H7K|5|Very good metal polish.  It cuts fast and really puts a shine on steel.
B00F672LSQ|5|Quality product. Installed snug just like the original part.
B00062Z1YM|5|perfect fit great product
B008DKDT0C|5|good retainer worked great for benz.
B00HCQA7S0|5|(Husbands truck and his feedback) Easy to install and they look great, however 5 of the brackets are the same and the different 1 for the front on the passenger side is just wacky and didn't need to be different I don't think.  I have 2015 Silverado Crew Cab and it seems like a bracket exactly the same as the other 5 would have been a better fit and saved me some time on the install as well (install video on the manufacturer website made it easy for those of use who learn by watching someone).  Otherwise, great so far just installed them today.  Total install time (went slow because I did it by myself) about 2hours.  You could do it in less time.  They are much lighter weight than they appear to be so handling is easy.
B007QXW5W0|5|Got them and put them on. Perfect match for my 98 Durango.
B00R6N975S|4|Doesn't fit ova da seat, only da back but I just slid it between da two & it looks good👍👌
B0031HZZTK|5|Perfect fit!
B00J7EEJLG|5|I didn't rasef LLE02-4.A Leather key fob...
B00KLEMC1A|5|Fits and works great
B001BLWCTO|5|Awesome lights to set you apart from the crowd!
B000VU7B4W|5|works well
B00DCO081W|5|I recently replaced both of my front CVs on my 07 Impreza.  Installation was surprisingly straightforward and only required a little bit of muscle at some points.  YouTube videos will show guys having to knock out a roll pin, but this is not present on the Non-Turbo models.  This confused me for some time.  I was able to simply pull the old ones out with a couple hard jerks.  If they give you a little trouble, use a screwdriver between the transmission and the axle and pry on it with gentle force all the way around.  You can tap the screwdriver with hammer lightly and they will budge.<br /><br />I've been rolling on these for close to 10,000 miles now and all noises when turning at lock out are gone.
B00LBIX6X8|5|Fast shipping and great product
B000C5HR6I|5|It's the best Cap ever buy OEM quality.
B00029WRM8|5|I installed this on my 1967 Cad. pass side and looks great and works fine.
B003VGMAM6|5|My headlights had gotten very foggy over the years and even acid washing by a professional would not be very good. So when I started looking at buying new headlights for my car I thought I was looking at over $600 for the pair. I was able to find this pair for under $200 for the pair. They fit perfectly and look absolutely wonderful!!!
B00GOQFDQA|4|Good quality bag but a little difficult to buckle
B00D3QUIUA|5|Bought item for my 08 jetta and they fitted fine!
B010HM43RQ|5|Did what I expected it to do
B00199BXU2|5|Easy installation. Included the electrical plug, high temp grease, and the plastic retaining clip to hold plug in place on vehicle. I had a heating element failure/code which is why I bought this. Fixed the problem and passed CA smog.
B001HLIMD8|5|Yes, it had a smell initially.  But it didn't take long for it to subside once exposed to the air.  I recently had a port installed for medical reasons, so this made the seat belt in my car more tolerable.  My son asked to use one too.
B00LXIYI7O|4|Nice
B00LWDVKD0|5|This is very nice, it fits good, and it ,looks good I am sure that you will like it.
B00BSEJYCM|5|Great value. Fast shipping and works perfect for the kids toys.
B008O8EGBE|5|This is a very high quality ladder. It is painted aluminum (black or white) and the hardware is all stainless.  Machining is exact. What I mean is that all the pieces fit together with no sloppiness. Once the Allen head bolts are tightened down there is no telling its sturdiness from a weld. The paint is beautiful, but brittle. While tightening some of the recessed bolts the paint would shatter. Its a small issue and now that it is installed on my van I think the paint's hardness will keep the ladder looking good for a long time.   I installed this on my 2006 sprinter rear door and discovered that access to the top ladder mounting bolts, where they would come through the exterior sheet metal at the top of the door was not possible from the inside. Tastefully cutting away the inside of the door (top only) was mandatory for putting on the self locking nuts. (The bottom of the door has a removable panel for access, but at the top there is no access.)   Cutting was easy with a reciprocating saw and a drilled hole to get the blade started. I've been wanting to insulate the back doors and now, with the new access that's possible. I'll cover the access hole with a panel of some sort and some nice looking screws. I'll probably replace the bottom access panels with the same material, as the original cardboard panels were getting a little beat up anyway. So it was a little more work than I'd imagined when ordering, but it worked out.  Just be aware that you'll need access to the back of the exterior skin (for nutting the bolts) no matter where the ladder is mounted.  Side vehicle mounting is also an option, and despite the fact that the ladder was only recommended for use on a Sprinter or Nissan I'm sure it could be used on any number of vehicles.  The ladder can be cut shorter and the rubber end caps simply installed over the cut end. Mounting brackets can be placed anywhere along the length of the rails making it very adaptable. The ladder is 14 inches wide with 12 inches from rung to rung and 82 inches in length. On my installation the outside of the ladder rails protrude 7 1/2 inches from the body. Between the body and the inside of the ladder rails there is a space of  5 1/2 inches. These inside and outside dimensions can be increased or decrease by 1 inch by utilizing different holes in the mounting bracket.   I'm very pleased with the ladder's appearance and quality and would purchase it again without hesitation.
B00TPZREQ4|2|Cute and well made but way too small for my 2015 GMC Acadia.
B000C9HWNM|5|ok
B00DSD58DA|5|Nice decal ... good quality
B001OZL9OQ|4|Great value although box was a little wet from a leaking bottle during shipping.
B003IS3HV0|2|I bought this product along with the cleaner to refurbish my 2002 acura rl's leather interior. After cleaning with the cleaner, I dried the seats and applied conditioner with a sponge. I followed directions and rubbed in a good amount (see photos). I let it sit for 24hrs before wiping it off with a lint free cloth.<br /><br />Results: The product was oily when applied, but came off clean. I was sad to see that the seats looked the exact same, and felt minimally more hydrated due to residual product. After a day went by, it looked the same as before I applied the product, except now my wallet was $15 short.<br /><br />I see a lot of reviewers here who give great praise to this item, but dont overlook the &#34;i received this product free/discounted&#34; disclaimers. It seems the company does a good job of hyping this product. I gave it a chance with high hopes and was let down.<br /><br />*shiny photos are the before, nonshiny are the after
B000NW8ES0|4|Good product
B0081S8S9I|5|Easy to install. A good way to fix the charging system on your old Kohler engine.

B00T6JGMP8|5|Worked great with my Joker turn signals.
B00C250MJA|1|THIS HELMET HAS BEEN RECALLED. I bought this exact helmet a couple years ago. Got a letter in the mail stating it was being recalled. Wouldn't recommend anyone getting this helmet.<br /> Defect Summary:<br /> recalling certain TMS JX-A5005 full face helmets with visors, size XL, manufactured June 1, 2013, to July 15, 2013. The affected motorcycle helmets failed the penetration test. Additionally, the helmet label does not meet DOT regulations. As such, these helmets fail to meet the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 218, &#34;Motorcycle Helmets.

B007IVTYPG|5|I found this Jeep License plate and was completely amazed with how it looked on my Jeep. It really compliments it well. I have not had it on long enough to see how it holds up to the elements, but for now I'm happy
B0000C6FOM|5|wish there were just a little taller
B0072AIOHW|1|It broke the first time I tried to use it, metal in the chain breaker is too soft.  The metal in the chain breaker is softer than the chain.  After 1 use it was clear I couldn't use it again.
B000AXE7DI|5|This works a lot better than the other cleaning sprays I've tried on my grill. It's the next best thing to bringing the grill inside and cleaning it in the sink with steel wool.
B00HZBOR56|1|I bought a black touch up pen for my toyota. It is essentially like someone took the ink from a sharpie and loaded it into a touchup pen. I verified I picked the correct one, but it doesn't match at all. It also will gush out of the pen with the slightest pressure because the ink is so thin, and it will get everywhere. In fact, even when wiping it off immediately with a damp cloth, it still discolored the clear coat around the scratch and I'll have to try to polish it off. Overall, pretty dissatisfied.
B000DINKPQ|4|Slightly better than stock volume.Decent value for $
B0054HNPDS|5|perfect
B0002STREU|3|Smaller than I thought, had to buy something else
B00COYNVLA|5|Love these. A tad too big for my car but works fine for what I need.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Easy to carry and fold back up and it's really big! My set up outside of our beach shelter and it kept the sand out.
B0083H4SMI|5|quick delivery good price
B003XU6D78|5|Great buy love them.  Sizing is correct and this model not leave your hands black.
B000CGVSG2|5|Great quality abd seller ..  would definitely recommend this product
B006B7YMRS|5|Superior fit and finish. Very happy with it. Well worth the extra money over the k&n.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Very sturdy. Easy to place.  Makes me sleep better in the evening.
B00YMU985M|4|nice anchor
B00RIV7C4Q|5|It is very suitable for MINI Copper 2008.
B001G4X4LQ|5|We purchased this to go camping. We recently bought an older Honda CRV. It fit perfectly and worked like a charm. It is sturdy and held up over hundreds of miles. It even came in handy when, mid trip, we helped a friend move. It was easy to assemble and put on the hitch. I am very satisfied with the quality of this carrier, especially for the price.
B000BUTD8Y|1|This cover will not fit 30lb tanks. It is about 6&#34; too short. You should change your description !!!!!!
B005JJ0D22|5|Great price and very fast shipping!
B00YB5GAEA|5|Excellent and small light,rechargeable via usb , bright enough to be seen I the evening or dark
B0000AZ71U|5|very happy
B00IEHIJ3G|1|remind me to never by a Kawasaki product again. this teryx has been broken more than it runs. then have to pay 650 dollars for a forty dollar fuel pump is the end for me and every person I can influence.
B001LHVOVK|2|It works okay but the acreen sucks! Pixels and can only read it tilted at an angle. Id prefer the ms309 over this model. Still reads codes and get the i/m readiness status
B001IH0SGU|5|Was exactly what I expected.  All items were in the package.  My boyfriend installed it at his work's shop.  It was handy to have as many tools available to do the project, and to watch the how to video on youtube.  I have had it on my Nissan for about a month.  We used it for a Bike Rack attachment and worked well.
B003YCMQCG|5|These are great gym towels.
B000RFUETA|5|very good
B00G5N24E6|5|thx
B001CF5156|5|I used these in my 2005 F350 and they worked out great even though I originally purchased them for my Jeep W Rubicon.
B003XU6DMI|3|Originally I bought these to use with my motorcycle, but I found they made my hands ache after about 30 minutes (I think because they don't have any pre-curve to them). So, now I use them for mowing the lawn, raking leaves, and around the house work where it's nice to have a little extra cushion on your palms. I also use these on my bicycle in cooler weather. The hi-viz is very bright. The reflectors aren't actually reflective as far I can tell. Just an FYI, the first few times I sweat in these gloves, there was black dye on my hands, but after a few wearings, the dye residue is gone. It did wash off with soap and a little scrubbing, so it wasn't a huge deal. I'm a medium in most gloves, and the medium size fit me just right. If you're looking for breathable but protective motorcycle gloves, there are better options even at this price. If you don't care so much about protection, these will probably work just fine for you. The palm is full leather, so it does have protection there, at least.
B00W31VMYC|1|Don't buy, it doesn't work no matter what you do or try[[ASIN:B00W31VMYC OxGord® Bluetooth OBD II OBD2 Reader Scan Tool - For Check Engine Light & Diagnostic Interface - 2015 Newest Technology - Android & Windows ONLY]]
B00O8QFDUO|5|Worked as advertized 1999 Toyota Tacoma. Does make the blink rate of the turn signals increase.
B000LNBLTK|5|Easy to use.
B00W24N1M6|1|Absolute waste of money. Did not cover and did not stick
B000C9IYIO|3|Fairly good

B00ODSB0MM|5|Nice, cool lignts.
B0000AXR76|5|350 mercruiser now runs like a top! I did have to gap them but you always should anyway.
B0036E9VB6|4|Does the job.
B0009JKIRC|5|All their products are superb! Old line company and German...
B003YMRNUG|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B00BH34DW0|2|Fan is very noisy and mounting bracket is flimsy.
B003G9IYQY|4|Appeared to be aftermarket or some other company makes it for Suburban. Different label packaging and sightly different part. The prongs where a little shorter than the original factory part so I used a screwdriver to bend the bracket slightly so get it in the correct position. Don't try to bend the prongs as you might damage the ceramic. My problem ended up being the circuit board but I had to at least try the lower cost part first. It will work though. Thanks
B00OLVGIDC|5|Nicely constructed mat.  Purchased this for my 2015 Chevy Colorado long bed and the fit is great.  The mat is nicely weighted that I know it will stay down while driving.  It does take some getting used to as it can make items catch on it due to the rubber construction but that is true for any rubber bed mat.  The cuts were spot on and very little if any gap is left on the rear tailgate side edge.
B003UGX4NG|5|Perfect replacements.
B00J8QNNWY|4|I ordered these capacitors because I've ordered there HID kit and I love them. The only thing I found bad was that the plugs were lose and bent. I fixed them and they work great. If you are looking for an anti-flickering options these are the way to go

B00NYMDXXW|5|Awesome decal will definitely buy more from sticky creations!!!!!!!
B0107S3XK8|3|Shorter than the original. Now my bike has two different length antennas. Makes it look like is has cerebral palsy. It also took 2 weeks to get here. On the plus side, it was beautifully packaged.
B00UO4EBYS|5|Was given as a gift and they were very pleased with the covers.
B00E3YH638|5|Good quality and arrived on time
B00H9S71LW|5|Couldn't have been any easier to hook up. No problems yet, I believe there won't be any either.
B004UPZVSC|5|liked it so much, I bought 2
B009ZCHFTI|5|Super product, a bit pricy for me but leaves a great finish
B0019IADHW|5|as expected
B00EKTJU26|4|good quality merchandise, looks food on car.
B00BZSDZ5I|3|Let me say I just installed this today, but I've seen them on Jeeps which is why I bought it - looks sharp.  I have no idea how long it was on the Jeeps I saw but this is made of plastic, not chrome or metal - it's very flimsy.  Second the installation parts come with no extras so make sure you line everything up correctly the first time when it comes to the stickers and all, and the screws are tiny.  Once you get it on, it looks really, really sharp - and looks like chrome, but I do question how long it will last and I don't think if anything impacts it like a highway rock, it will last.
B000E4PCGE|5|Perfect fit
B000KZ2CBA|4|works great with my 2000 honda accord, even opens the trunk. i just wish they where a little bit cheaper. the remotes for other models are way cheaper.
B0006IX7UQ|5|We've had these ice cube trays over a year and they are our favorite trays.  The ice cubes are a great size for our cups with lids and straws.  The ice cubes consistently pop out.  And they fit in my mini-fridge at work.  We're going to buy some more to keep at home:-)
B0028JQYPG|5|Car hasn't fallen on me yet. Will revisit if it ever does.
B000F34RWE|4|fit well wish it came with more Velcro.
B0007TQWKQ|4|Does not really look like fabric but that may be my application of the product.
B0015YD3AY|5|good product
B005ER5L26|3|rad helmet
B000RU41NU|1|This is a great shock.  Unfortunately it doesn't fit the Sprinter
B00NLVG3M4|5|These were to replace all components as water had destroyed most of my old ones. I was expecting the parts to ship just as you see here, all apart, and we just need to put it together and get them in the truck. I was pleasantly surprised to have everything all pieced together, ready to install. It was literally plug and play! I would recommend you buy these RIGHT NOW. Everything fit perfectly by the way.
B00KIZP8PO|5|Great product and customer service!
B00DBENCZC|5|My English is very bad! but not last lez lights burned in 8 days
B002PZ1ISG|5|I was having problems with my motorcycle due to leaving old gas in tank.  I am now using sta-bil in my fuel for motorcycle, 4 wheeler, lawnmowers, chainsaws, weed eaters & vehicles.  I highly recommend using it to have less fuel problems,
B001FK7KUM|5|Although it was a MAJOR pain installing this fuel pump, it's working great and it is good to know that it's the true OEM model.
B00S5O3DIY|5|I use this in my classroom, my students love it!!
B008FCE880|1|Does not fit Buick Enclave.
B00029K21G|3|Good equipment but could not use
B00CZEZNGU|4|great lights a little pricey
B00GX4Y9AY|1|Not worth it does not hold charge.  When I got let charge for a day.  Kept in vech approx three months after having and not using went to jump vech the pack was dead as a nail.  Junk.
B00QRJMMP4|4|up one size when ordering mine is a little to tight
B011FXQUCC|5|These protector handguards are stainless and durable. They were easy to install in my motorbike because I didn’t face any challenge. I love the great protection they offer while riding. I will recommend this product to all people who have Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Suzuki Motorbikes.
B004GCDU28|5|Delivered on time and item matched the description

B0073MEOGO|5|So impressed with the quality of Workmanship went right in no problem needed a new thermostat because it cools that good
B007ZGBMMM|4|I had my coilovers installed a week ago and so far the ride has been really comfortable. The coilovers are adjusted by the recommended height Tein suggests, which is 1.1 inch drop on the front and 1 inch on the rear. The best part about these coilovers, I'm able to adjust how stiff I want my ride to be.
B0001CMUV4|5|This coast four times as much as at my hardware store. But it does do the job
B007RZ06TQ|5|Universal fit for Saabs and does everything as advertised
B003HF0Q7W|5|Used it on the interior of car that I was changing from beige to black. It works great! Don't be afraid to apply it in generous amounts on the first coat. It's not really the type of paint/dye that you need super light coats. At least that was my experience with it. They call it paint here but I'm pretty sure it's really a dye. Sprays on just like spray paint though.
B000C9GYOA|5|Worked great. A/C is back.
B000BZAAY0|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B00B7ORHNG|5|Cheap and easy. Perfect protection for my head unit.
B007U9EXVQ|2|After it is applied does not stick very well.
B0064ELHX0|3|Will not work with standard lug nuts, will need to purchase extra long lug nuts.
B00H5A4F22|1|Broke out of nowhere, for no reason. I bought this for my girlfriends car, which I am not in very often and I noticed a really annoying sound which she solves by turning up the radio. Finally after hours of searching and paranoia I realized the clip had broken and there were pieces inside the mirror rattling around. Now we literally put this in her car and never moved it. It's not like we took it from car to car all the time and were using it hard. I took apart the mirror to find that this fairly tough springs were being held by these little plastic tabs. It's just a bad design is all and cheaply made. Too much tension on these tiny little pegs.<br /><br />As for the mirror itself, I liked it. It added visibility, the blue tint does help with lights at night since you lose the ability to tilt it like your stock mirror.
B0039OB60M|2|Hose popped off the bag after a couple of weeks.
B00VB2OE9O|2|To small
B00PFFG1EO|5|Works great to diagnose and program my Honda and Lexus.
B008NFIRBS|3|It looks good and works ok but I had to add washers as spacers so the outer chrome trim from the bike wouldn't bend. I also enlarged the back holes in the frame and tapped them to support the rider better.
B000HS1356|5|I have two of these covers, for my 2013 Fx1 and a CBR 1000.
B005FKMQDO|1|Trying to figure out how to return them.<br />Parts don't fit my car
B00BD4ORCO|5|Could be a little wider,other then that, great
B00SS12TP2|4|It may be chrome &#34;plastic&#34;, but accent the saddlebags very nicely. Be careful during installation - Once the adhesive touches something, it is there to STAY! Make sure you have the accents where you want it the FIRST time - No second chances!
B000CMJIIG|5|In my car now and has gotten me out of a jam more then a few times. Closes a bit weird but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad. Nice little tool set.
B0020MGA4G|5|I have already install it!
B00KXNR4YO|5|Very happy with this product. Easy to install. Clear and bright.
B00L6NTF06|4|I have purchased a set of 5k lowbeams, and 3k foglight bulbs. They look great, and are easy to install. I am planning on buying more of these for my other vehicles.<br /><br />the picture is of the bulbs installed in my 2004 pontiac bonneville GXP
B000YE59A8|5|I just installed my driver side on my dakota,easy install seems like a good quality hub to me,had no problems whatsoever, perfect oem fit,I had no idea that this part was gonna come with a new spindle nut,I ordered a set of 2,when i ordered this 1, so now I have 2 extras lol,Its ok though I liked it so much now im gonna order the passenger side,I dont care what other reviews say about this product not lasting long,as long as you know what your doing and and have the tools and knowledge to install this the RIGHT way,I cant see this part going bad anytime soon,Just make sure you have a good impact with a 36 mm socket ,If you dont use an impact your gonna have a helluva time busting off the stock 1 , get some good hi temp grease,and follow the torque specs of the spindle nut,and you should be fine:)
B00B0C7PJG|5|The power stop brakes are quiet and work really well. I will definitely be purchasing a set for the rear. The only issue I had was from shipping, the pads were damaged from the weight of the rotors. If your on the fence about purchasing the power stop brakes and rotors, they are worth it!
B009VUABGS|5|Quality product and fast shipping!
B0095TC6I6|4|This product really works! I have a travel trailer and I have purchased and returned generic mirror extenders from the big box stores that just don't work at all, even though they say they will fit my particular car mirror. The JR Product really does fit and it is so easy to attach and remove.
B00KJ8PP58|5|It is easy to install.  Remove the fuse cover plate on the side of the dash put your old switch in off potion, push in and turn right it will come right out. Unplug the old switch take the wire and plug it in to the light sensor controller and run wire for light sensor I installed the light sensor in the upper part of the A pillar. Plug sensor controller into new switch push switch into the dash and bam your done. Took me about 15 min total. The switch works well and looks OEM in fact the switch had a VW part number.
B004QEM6HQ|5|I didn't want to write a review until we actually used the receiver hitch so now that we've done that I can write an honest review. Installing it was a snap and I like the way it has the slight drop...makes it easier to pull shorter trailers. You can also flip it over, adjust the ball and use it for a taller one (we haven't done that yet). The hubster keeps forgetting its on the truck and smacks his shin on it ALL the time, so listening to him cuss gives me some comical entertainment. :)
B0006H841O|3|When they arrived there was a piece broken. We were able to JB Weld it back for the sake of dealing with the return. The piece was a little spoke like object sticking out the back used for placement.
B002E7FKCK|5|Great lights. Look really good.
B00916MMJG|4|Little bit bendy but I also but a HEAVY bike on it. Kl600. Still sturdy enough I trusted it in a maiden voyage of 200 miles and it did just fine. Assembly was actually fun and I would rather assemble it completely myself anyway as I don't trust other people
B00GM4UUZS|4|Arrived promptly.  It's very nice, but is not rainproof.
B00WUP0580|4|Easy to put on and easy to use, great product.
B0031P6B3Q|2|Did not fit my 1999 Coleman Bayside popup camper door. The product itself was good quality, however.
B007Q1DQHK|1|Set speeds already whent out....2days.:-(
B0089C4J5S|1|did not fit car it specified it would fit
B003OEXYZC|5|High quality sun shade.
B009ZQ7OC2|5|Affordable & fast shipping.
B00B29VHTQ|5|Great product.  Very well engineered and made.
B003DL9DC4|1|I bought this mount and it broke after only 300 miles leaving my plate somewhere on the road.
B00VK4H75G|1|I purchased this for safety (as it is for my daughters Jeep) not simply DOT compliance.  This mirror is impossible to see out of.  The mount and shaft retainer suck, that is they do not hold well.  When you try to adjust the mirror they strip the practically useless knurls that are intended to keep the shaft from pivoting once tightened.
B00SK49JNM|5|This light bar is super bright and looks good on my RZR 1000. Instant daylight at the flip of a switch.
B00RRCHND6|5|Great Storage...keeps things from sliding around. I truly love it.
B0000AYFTH|5|Does what it is supposed to do, great little extendomatic for trailers that aren't yours.
B0050I11PA|5|AWESOME! Didn't even have a key to start with I had lost my original Easy to program tried 2xs then it started!! Saved so much $$ Only thing I changed the 2nd time was waiting 5 seconds between on an off on the instructions Highly recommend!
B007B83T98|1|Led works but very very dim barely see that it is on
B000C5HRGS|5|In the last 50 years, I have only had one (1) thermostat fail mechanically after only two (2) years in service.  In the last two (2) years, I have had two (2) of these thermostats leak around the O-ring.  It looks like Ford screwed up the O-ring size or the material.  These thermostats on the 6.0 diesel need to be replaced each year or you risk a leak.
B00D329B8Y|5|Fits great in my Toyota 4-runner
B002XLHUQG|5|Great stabilizer.  It stopped the camper from moving and the added ability to lock them in place with a regular pad lock adds an additional level of security.
B00AFEM0KO|5|Great little sound systems can be heard over Vance Hines pipes at 75 no problem would recommend to anyone . Getting ready for 1200 mile road trip will let you know how we'll they work!
B001AWPYA8|4|Very easy to install, looks good, and more importantly serious smoothed out my ride.  One thing they don't tell you ahead of time is that on some bike models (like mine) that require a specific sleeve (included in packaging) you will need a U-clamp or something to press the sleeve into the eyelets.<br /><br />2015 XL1200X Sportster 48.  Bought it new off the lot and had only test driven one in the city.  When I got mine out to the highway I was amazed at how horrible and even dangerous the stock suspension was.  Dangerous because the first time I hit a bump at highway speed I damn near was launched off the bike.  It might as well be a hardtail.  Actually kind of pissed at Harley for how crappily the bike rides on the highway.  Crap suspension, crap saddle, etc.  Good thing I plan on heavily modding this bike....anyway-<br /><br />I put the Progressive 430s on and took her for a ride last night.  It's still a sporty so this is never going to ride with the Cadillac smoothness of a &#34;glide&#34; model but compared to the stock springs the Progressive shocks give my 1200 a plush, smooth ride that is FAR more comfortable.  It's really an amazing difference.  I banged out 60mi with the progressives and it was very comfortable.  I highly recommend the upgrade.<br /><br />Hand adjustment is relatively easy.  I read some reviews that it can be tough for some people to adjust the pre-load but it was far easier than I expected.<br /><br />WELL worth the money.
B00BTJN2GA|5|Nothing says satisfaction like a repeat customer.  I've ordered three different colors and they were all a perfect match.
B00IAAV5XI|5|just what my truck needed  drives better than new
B008MDX8CO|5|Beter than I expected ,<br />Super fast shipping ,<br />Will recommend
B000C55SXW|5|ok
B00DC5TV0A|5|seems like a good set of ramps  nice and light too
B0067NGQQQ|5|Just as described, fast shipping.
B0054T8XE2|4|SO FAR SO GOOD
B001LLFOZS|4|a
B00P7EQXZU|5|They work great
B00C2LYHWW|4|Worked great inyerchangable from a 05 to a 97
B008L4SXQU|5|Fits perfectly. If you don't mind the fact that it won't match the color of your car it's a good replacement. This is the third time this piece broke so this is a less expensive alternative to the Toyota product.
B004107292|5|perfect of changing the oil
B00YNNAXKM|5|Well made and fit my 2015 GMC Canyon perfectly.
B0018YE9GI|5|Good price, no squeals
B00MBVA3LW|5|Great product!
B008AGKSXA|5|My teenage son loves this new helmet that I gave him for his birthday.  He says that it is comfortable, cool, and the vents work better than his old one.  And he loves the bright color, which I like too because it makes him more visible.
B006O0H9PO|5|Worked perfectly, received on time. Great product at a great price
B00JZXDE3S|4|What I was looking for.  Did some modifying to improve performance.
B007NZ9GYG|3|You must have a spring compressor and you will most likely need new boots anyway, just buy complete quick struts
B0092P19T0|5|Easy to install, fit perfect and does exactly what it was made for.
B00U8MR6SE|2|It's not the right size as the two contacts are bottom plug end are the smaller size and I couldn't find this in reviews or description...will hopefully pass along to someone that can use it
B002626OLY|3|Dried out my Louis Vuitton and cracked the canvas :( but worked great on my other leather bags!
B004NK5FI0|5|Slight difference but is working great
B0085IJIPC|5|Exact match, cost more then the round version (which will work). This was for a stove top fan. Please note, reach up and hold back of fan motor or remove motor with bracket, yes it is a  small space but I was able to get my hand up there. I also used a small wood mallet hammer to tap center of blade onto shaft, much easier the pushing with thumbs. Fan blade is a tight fit. Works fine and is quite. If you are not sure of direction of motor spin, after installation of new blade, turn it on, light a match and blow it out and watch smoke direction. If done correctly, smoke from match will go up and out.
B00K87U5CI|5|unbelievable price. amazing quality. FAST SHIPPING!!!!!!!
B008FCE7ZO|5|Excelente product original
B005EMGV3O|5|Great product and shipped on time.
B00WN5NAFC|3|I rated it a three star as it is a pain in the butt to put on and off the truck !
B000NKU13S|5|satisfied!!
B002NGCO30|5|I got this a few weeks ago, I can't attest to how long it lasts before running empty which is important BUT I've used it to pump up a flat tire, jump my car when the battery died, recharge my cellphone and light my way to the men's room in the woods when I forgot my flashlight while camping.  So far it's very handy, I do hope the battery lasts awhile, it's very useful at camp or in the car.
B00HNKYD0I|5|great door edge guard protection and easy installation on my vehicles. Stays on well without all the fuss and using double sided tape. It does already have glue inside of it so it will be sticky if you have to pull the sides apart for installation when it hangs up and doesn't go on smoothly. Helps to maintain the value of a vehicle with less scratches and dents. This is indeed enough for two vehicles.  A+ seller and great items.
B0042Z0XWY|5|perfect
B00DSD81IO|3|Has small intricate parts that are very difficult to peel off without damaging. Took two of us to put in on my car window. For $2 you can't expect perfection. Once we got it on it looks adorable!
B00QCI2V10|1|PLEASE DONT BUY VERY CHEAP AND WONT STICK THIS LASTED LIKE 2 days!!!!!!
B00HZ870GM|3|Have tried several of the built in tune packs not noticing much of a difference.
B007QC3HP0|5|Came in on time and was perfect for the job I had!
B00HUVR528|5|Great price fast delivery
B00MWH72IW|5|Nice cover fits a 2011 Mustang Convertible. Good quality for the price !
B007ZGBLNW|5|A+
B01024SQ4U|1|Didn't fit properly had to make it fit -03 corolla
B000CN9KB0|2|Installed fairly easily and look good.  The problem is that the windows will not go up more than half way.  The instructions say to raise and lower the windows approximately 5 times to help seat the visors in the channel.  After 2 hours I have yet to get even one window to close.  I'll be returning this junk and plan not to buy anything else from EGR.  Thanks EGR for waisting my time.
B00EIR7PW2|5|wifey likes it...sooooo I guess I like...lol
B005VV9UBS|4|Fit my 07 Avalanche perfectly.
B00KTHZISI|1|these keys are  nice looking useless product. You can not place your lexus original key as the metal is fixed to the case.<br />I wasted my money.
B00V3XFFE4|5|Very cool seat bolt, tried others, but this one is hands down the best. Perfect size, and stays on. The last 2 I bought were really big, and were ugly as hell. Your eyed went right to the seat bolts because of its unusual size. This one is way smaller, better quality, and doesn't come undone.
B00075XCAS|5|It took my son and I all of 10 minutes to install!  The predrilled holes lined up perfectly and the unit is well constructed. Very happy I went with this model!
B00C5RB03W|5|perfect fit  no more bugs in my drain hose
B005EJGSQ2|3|A small bit of plastic broke very quickly, leaving sharp screws sticking out.  The elastic is weak and it doesn't stay put on the seat very well.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's very cheap and definitely gets nice and toasty.
B005LASPB0|5|The original one in the car was tan and the lid hinge was broken.  Easy to replace once I received it (took about a month to get)  Quality is good and the black one looks much better than the old tan one.
B00SA3TSE8|1|Lookes really good till they turned white would have just bought white and save some money if i would have know they weren't going to stay blue very disappointed.
B006CSSKCO|5|The best
B009LOS0KS|5|So far so good.  Hard to really say, since it took the original about 6 years before it became a defect.
B00F8LEB9W|4|Keys arrived promptly.  However, the batteries were old and after a couple of months, needed to be replaced.  It can be tricky to get multiple KEs set to the same security code - primarily because of the &#34;strange&#34; way Ford designed the activation sequence.  When I had my truck into the shop for other work, I asked for some help with it and it was a kind of hit and miss proposition but with two experienced staff, they finally got 3 of them set the same security code.
B000ZIC18Q|4|great speaker
B008JORKP2|5|We were planning a camping trip a few weeks ago, and noticed that the campground had a campfire burn ban in effect.  It did allow for propane firepits so we decided to try this out after reading reviews.  I absolutely love it!!!  We did not have to worry about having campfire smoke blow in our faces (it always seems to follow you even if you move your chair).  I might use this for now on when camping.  It put off great heat, and was easy to put together.  I highly recommend.
B00336TW6Q|5|These fit on my 2007 Saturn Outlook XR with an automatic rear liftgate perfectly. If you're original ones are slowly going out dont be intimidated on replacing them, it was super easy. I did it in a few minutes, but you just need a specific tool (a long stick or a friend) to stand there and hold the door up all the way while you change them. Also, replace BOTH, even if one of the old ones still works replace it. It will go bad and put more stress on the new one.
B000CGI37O|4|Exactly what I needed.
B008HIVH5E|5|Very nice sticker.  Works well on van rear window.  Sharp colors.
B00QMWQSAG|4|Vehicle:  Hyundai Elantra Sedan, 5th Generation (MD/UD)  These mats arrived quickly, and were easy to install.  The charcoal color was a good match for my interior trim (gray) -- not perfect, but just about as good as I could ever expect to get without buying custom mats.  I've seen a lot of reviewers complain about the thickness of the mats. They seem fine to me.  I have no clue how thick car floor mats are supposed to be -- but these are definitely a lot thicker than the carpet inside the vehicle -- so I don't have any complaints.  I paid the full cost on Amazon, which was $12.95 + free shipping at the time I bought them... so I can't see how anyone could expect better for the price.  The mats are carpeted on one side, rubber backed on the other with nibs on the backing to keep the mats from sliding around. Again, the carpeting is thicker and has a somewhat more plush feel than the factory-installed carpet in the car itself -- so whatever the quality, it's certainly good enough for this particular vehicle and trim.  My car has little plastic hooks to hold floor mats in place.  These mats do not come with holes for those hooks.  I was able to easily create my own holes by putting each mat in place to measure the location of the hook, then pushing  a nail through the mat to create a hole, and then using a threaded metal bolt to widen the hole so it is large enough for the hook.  This left no visible marks on the mats - in the car you can see the hooks coming through, but the edge of the mat is flush with the hook.  I don't think that the mats are likely to rip in the area of the hole because of the rubber backing.  The driver's side mat was not a perfect fit.  Good enough, but too wide at the top to fit perfectly into the well.  However, I was able to install it as is -- I did not attempt to cut the mat size down.  It seemed to fit well, lying flat under the pedals -- but just to be extra safe, I added some velcro strips to the back of the mats in that area.  Therewas nothing about the mats themselves that would cause me to believe they would slip around.... but this just seemed like a logical thing to do.  I am happy with this purchase and feel like it is a very good value.  I've uploaded some pictures to show the fit problems on the driver's side. I also included a passenger side photo -- no problem there-- just to show what the mats look like when installed
B00C565O9Y|5|Excellent fit and fixed my problem quick.
B00XTA787Q|3|only fits smaller vehicles
B004DJCS2M|3|I D K ?
B000W0TM6Q|5|Top Quality, would buy again!
B00CIVU0K4|5|great
B002LGEMOQ|5|Great inverter,feeds my rv with hreat power
B00KVL4QOE|1|Was not jumbo at all. It was for a Mini Cooper or smart car. Very disappointed.  Quality thin
B00QHA3356|5|Fit well didn't use their adhesive had my own
B004HELSU6|5|It works great. Easy and simple to install.
B00TRTVGCQ|5|Superb. This is not a decal or bumper sticker: the white characters transfer onto the target surface<br /><br />I installed this on my Cessna and flew  it for 12 hours at speeds up to 180 mph. I'm guessing that is the most extreme test ever performed. Gets a chuckle out of all of my passengers. (I fly with my dog frequently).
B00H9WO3N2|5|Perfect
B00RHE9SRI|3|Should be &#34;Firemen&#34;
B00EYC1VA8|4|Good
B004IVGA0G|4|The hole for the flagpole itself is bigger than I expected. Does not really fit too well with a regular flagpole. Pin is also a bit too short. All in all it gets the job done
B008Y3OQSM|4|thanks
B00JL7Y8MY|1|Not happy :(
B000NVW1LM|1|Had minor leak from oil pan and this product was no help what so ever.  Waste your money at your own risk...
B00BG3G5FO|5|Works great.. easy to change
B00T9URV40|5|Exactly what I needed
B00SH1SN6C|5|I am delighted with the product,  but to be honest, it's one of those things that you hope to never have to use. In that regard, so far so good.
B00HKTMQQ0|5|Lasted way longer than I thought it would. I used it in my postal delivery vehicle. I get in and out hundreds if times day, so I expected it to wear out quickly. Worked to relieve my lower back pain.
B00QXVZNPM|5|Fit perfect.
B00651CLCS|1|Doesn't fit 2015 jeep as stated...adaptor pieces are all too small.
B00Q5VVH2S|3|Hard to get a good connection. Disappointed. Would send it back but lost the packaging.
B0006MRS3Y|4|Worked as intended.  Seams had sharp protrusions which had to be shaved before use.
B001NYYREC|5|worked great.
B00NETL472|5|Great price.  Looks nice on my new Indian Scout.
B00NTU18KY|4|Works Great - a few minor things.  First, the display text, when connected to a device, is backwards.  Not a big deal but you need to bend the cables a little to see the output.  Second, I wish the built-in light stayed on a little longer.  It shuts off after a few seconds.  Overall, it works as advertised and I'm happy with it.
B002WTMR6W|5|Well, it's an O-Ring, and it works.
B007J7G4HK|5|Excellent item
B00IB1XAK2|5|Just put them on our FJ...Look awesome, great quality.
B00HSDT9FE|4|Met expectations
B000CSPI3E|5|it sparks, the engine runs good
B00IWP3RN2|5|These tools works great for me
B001O7PNXC|5|Good
B006X98A7C|1|Appears to be used/reconditioned.  Arrived with scuff marks on the underside, and what's worse viscous liquid resembling electrolyte, in the packaging and on the battery case.  Works now, but I doubt it'll last very long.  Going to return it.
B002WV80CA|5|Fantastic bag. Good quality. Perfect place to put all the stuff I carry in my pockets when I ride my KLR.
B00HVHA0EG|5|One of  our two 2007 Lexus RX 350 key FOBs broke.  I repaired it with super glue. I purchased two of these rubber key covers and they fit snugly over the FOBs.  So far I am happy with the product.
B006QGD996|2|&#34;Directions&#34; were terrible - didn't explain how to thread the fabric through the ratchet and these ended up being useless.
B00EF1ES6C|4|installation was more time consuming than I expected but they are as advertised and do the job.
B001AZVRAQ|5|Really nice
B00U1OA4L0|5|love it...looks alsome
B008FTWW9A|5|Still looking good after many miles
B001AVXA0K|5|A straight-forward, heavy-duty steel sprocket.  I mounted this one side-by-side with my stock 50 tooth sprocket-I had to buy about $15 worth of longer bolts, some nuts, and some washers to space it out correctly, but it was all money well spent.  My motorcycle runs much better at highway speed, and doesn't feel nearly as &#34;buzzy,&#34; due to the lower RPMs.  Highly recommend.
B001JL4294|5|Sweat Well worth the Money Looks awsome  on my black truck with black tool box
B000CCFCEK|4|Hard to find full front floormats for a truck these days.  I put them in my 1980 Chevrolet C10.  These do a great job.  They are a little thin, but they get the job done.
B006K8IR3I|3|The quality of construction is quite good.  Very solid.  However, the item description says that it's a &#34;swivel style&#34;.  They do not swivel.  Because of that, they don't work for my application.  Nuff said.
B000C36BDK|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B000CRCVDK|5|Product worket well
B003O93Q50|1|Impossible to install on my 2008 MB R350. I had to return and pay shipping.<br />Had to go to MB dealership to buy the OMG  $100 for the set.<br />Waste my time and money on S/H. Don't buy.
B007RHX06U|4|ok
B0071I2N18|5|It took some work to remove the old pin and bushing. Once I accomplished that the new pin and bushing worked perfectly. My advise is to support the door and unbolt the door from the hinge. Do NOT remove the hinge from the body of the truck. Otherwise you will have to realign the door. I cut the old pin with a dremel tool and use vise grips to  twist the pin to loosen it.
B00S5HMVM0|5|This is an excellent triangle and everybody must have it in their cars. I looked different options but this got my attention. I read a few reviews about no reflection properties but I said Nah, let me try it. It's true that the triangle doesn't have reflections but the lights on it are amazing. They improve a lot because the triangle can be seen far away. I put a small vinyl reflection (red) on large edge beside the lights and problem resolved! I have an amazing triangle ready for deploy in any case. BTW, due to the batteries compartment is not hard to open I have a small piece of paper of the end of the battery in order avoid any drain or leak of the batteries.
B000JFJLP6|4|we used the Jump-N-Carry as a power source at a campground. It was used primarily to charge cell phones, computer, recyclable batteries, two kindles and to power the pump which blew up the mattress (Let the kids rough it. I camp comfortable.) The unit works fine and we had no problems. We used it for 10 days. Except for the fact that it is one heavy piece of equipment for its size, it was exactly what we needed. When I got home it still had enough power to do a quick vacuuming of the car.
B00HQZNOQO|1|Doesn't fit. It's way to small. The brackets click in the pop out as soon as you close. Not even close. It's molded plastic so I'm guessing no of them will ever fit anything
B001EAQTRI|5|This device removed the whining noise from a  Bluetooth Audio to Aux receiver installed in my wife's car. Well worth the money for reliveing my audio aggravation!
B00G23Y37U|5|Make my Rogue wheels look nicer.
B005WXDPRA|4|It works fine! Wish it came with tied owns.
B0013REXI4|5|Very heavy duty.
B001SGC6T8|5|Perfect Fit on 2000 Pontiac Sunfire, easy installation if you know what you're doing.
B00L7XH9D0|5|they are great on the truck makes my 99 look new or close to it
B0002F66DI|2|Wrong size
B00AQSO49E|5|Lots of features for the price, seems well made. Would buy it again.
B0018YCRVM|5|Perfect  Great price
B00EC1N83E|4|As everyone states its a very focused and small beam but the light is very clear. The distance is great too. I wouldn't pay the full market price for this but the amazon price is fair. Attached is a picture of the color difference between the halogen and LED spotlight
B00IKYP9Q8|5|Tail light was delivered in good time and was received in perfect condition. Only problem was the installation lacked a nylon clip that holds the light in place and  is only intended for one time use. Would have been great if the nylon part was included since it is integral to installation.
B00V0UNNVW|5|Item arrived quickly.  It was well packaged and as expected.  THANK YOU
B00VK1GOSU|5|they are clear but light up 2 red & 2 amber
B008CE0W5Y|5|This was a great purchase. I have a 3.5 X 5 trailer from Lowe's that I use on the highway and it was really hard to see the brake lights on a sunny day. Not any more. These LED's are bright and Distinctive. Even the side markers stand out.
B000TYTSPA|5|good quality for the price, looks just like the original.
B000ZMWYVQ|5|good price.
B0002JN588|5|As Advertised
B00M7RERPS|1|This product begs for you to get into an accident because you are distracted. Seems very very unsafe. Note that I do not own this product, but instead just want to encourage everyone to slow down a little and be safe. Multitasking is not always the best way to do things!!
B004MDEV38|1|This CURT hitch has a great reputation.  Unfortunately we were/are unable to experience this as the hitch was delivered to our home completely unpackaged.  There was minimal protective wrapping.  It was left laying on our side steps outdoors which would not of been an issue if it were wrapped in bubblewrap and a large cardboard box.  The hitch is completely scratched up with large chunks of paint missing,so much so that bare metal is showing in many areas.  Its very disappointing since the CURT website prides itself in their craftsmanship and especially their high gloss enamel protective finish.  It doesn't make sense to have something crafted so well and then ship it totally uncovered.
B0009H529S|5|good stuff
B00DNX92TQ|5|bag is well made and big enough for a day trip...will not hold a helmet.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.
B00MT3W29S|5|As a parking garage worker, spills occur regularly. This absorbent is very effective. Almost always just sweeping is needed. I would just like to say that be sure to have plenty on hand BEFORE you need it.
B002XYAKU6|5|Perfect.... my husband loved it.
B00R0TU2IO|5|The fuel cut off is definitely sweet but the cap being able to bend and hold the hose in place is also much appreciated.  Awesome product.
B00HWKL5GY|5|Product was beautiful and it was exactly what i wanted
B0078U9KJW|4|App on the site said that it would fit my truck but it was too long and had too send back, But looked to be of very good quality.
B00VPRIXGU|5|did the job.great going!!
B009OBW5XQ|5|Works well!
B00DZEA1W0|5|ok
B009TUCD8O|5|Fantastic buy and the tool works well
B008K7U35M|5|This stuff is expensive....BUT....it really does work and a little goes along way.  Many RV parks no longer allow washing rigs in the park, or charge crazy fees, to spruce things up this is the ticket, just get some micro fiber rags and most road dirt will come right off leaving nice shine and protective coat behind.
B007V2CM2O|5|it could've been a little wider and a little taller for an even better fit.  But I love it.  Gonna get one for  my Charger.
B00WQYL9T4|2|The mailing was great but item did not work at all
B00873J0YY|4|I like that the padding adjusts on the j-frames, and that they arrived quickly (dusty and banged up box, but all parts there!) and the set of straps will work for a while (not great quality, but they don't loosen, which is important. Assembly was a pain in the butt, the bolts that cross through the frame and serve as the anchors for the crossbars have a hex shaped head that has to be pressed into place exactly or they don't tighten down completely. So I had to improvise to get them through the rubber mold and j tubes by hammering onto a socket wrench nestled into the opening on top of them, AFTER making sure everything was lined up right. Took a bit to figure this step out, but once I did it was smooth sailing. Instructions were complete crap, but they've a very logical set up and order for the parts to go to assemble. I'm glad I only have to do it the first time though, and that attaching/removing them from the car rack is easy. My Rola car rack has wide braces that are low in profile, the curves of the j racks anchor really well to those!
B00563C6L2|5|Awesome fit!  Great feel in the hand.
B000CIV70W|5|I was glad that Mobil came out with own oil filters some time ago. When I change oil, I always but this oil filter.
B001B0QBZ6|5|Works great and is a very simple item.
B004A2D4N4|2|Did not know that it was just repair parys
B001AY2WLU|5|this was an absolutely amazing tool that incongruously see my dad use. it's pocket size and really unique!
B00RUE1RUQ|4|Everything was fine except, all of the light bulbs were double prong on the ends. The front lights are double prong but the rear lights are a single prong. You may want to fix this on your next shipment.<br />Rick
B00LEBLI82|5|Very bright and dropped my amp draw on my batteries considerably.
B00QFMA8DQ|4|These are fairly bright and more of a white light. They are much brighter than the standard bulbs, which are more of a yellow color.
B004GCYPYU|5|It is the same as the original, can't tell it has been replaced
B00J7RB72M|5|good dal as advertised
B001892W7G|5|So much easier thatn the old bolts.. Highly recommend.
B00KVO2XXW|3|it ok
B004SND8EA|4|Great rack. OEM BMW so it fits great. However, I hate the premium price for BMW parts
B000EDUTNQ|4|works well
B00S7ONHH4|5|It works.  Simple to use and even comes with a convenient case. Haven't tried updating it, but it worked right out of the box.<br /> My code shows up as a right front passenger seatbelt tensioner.  It only showed up after inadvertently sliding the seat too fast forward and slamming it.  Not sure if the shock was enough to disrupt something, but I find it hard to believe that something was actually broken.  I've used the scanner to erase the code ... hasn't shown back up in 3 days, but at least I know if I need to replace the tensioner this scanner will indeed erase the code.
B005FJ0BRI|5|cool
B00RXZBBHG|5|Exactly as described, works great
B00GMYN28A|1|VERY CHEAP AND NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY ONE BROKE OF AND NOBODY TOUCHED IT
B007YVOJZK|4|As described.
B00T8GH35M|5|goood
B00VPRIXGU|5|They expedited this part to me overnight at what I considered a very reasonable cost. There description of the part was perfect so I knew it would fit my machine. I give these guys five out of five.
B00AFV7DHW|5|Great product for the price !<br />A lot cheaper than replacing the whole mirrors. They vibrate a little but serve their purpose, I only use them when towing which is not that often.<br />They snap on easily and look great, same appearance as my stock mirrors. Thanks for a great product !
B006R2RZOY|5|Extremely bright festoons! Did not expect that these would have such great light output but I am thoroughly impressed!
B00883N7AQ|1|didn't work
B00M6TX5NW|5|Excellent appreciate the service
B007SVE2R6|5|So i told all mah boiz dat i had a ducati and nun of dem beleeved me. So i bawt diss keychain until i could steel a bike cuz mah credit is so bad dat i can't even apply for a job. Dats why i dont werk either
B00ABRFG1U|5|Good quality.  Had to go to you tube for instructions.
B000IZ5ZJ8|5|Super easy to install, the whole process to install it took 30 minutes in a parking lot. I had it shipped to me on the road because I wanted to roll up my window. Crazy right? It fit perfect, and worked perfect.
B00GHXWDG8|5|Great. Just follow directions and its all good
B00NS283CE|5|Best ones I have ever used, comfortable with a helmet, good noise isolation, but can still hear traffic, radio etc, good filter of wind noise.
B0070I83ZY|5|As described, great Product.
B00KPZECVI|3|It works but i didn't realize that the remote state button was not included.  Not sure if the description stated this.
B00AA7OFLI|5|Used half to mount to my original brake and clutch mounts and mounted my speakers ,  Works Great
B00OGMPZ62|3|The seat cover is made decently, and of thick material.  It is similar to the old one that came with a classic truck I bought, and that's why I purchased this one.  This cover would be 5 stars, however the seat belt cutouts are in the wrong spot, about 6 inches away from the seat back.  The seat belts cannot be easily accessed the way it is, and once I cut out new holes for the seatbelts to protrude from, then I'm left with two sets of holes.
B00192JFBI|4|Fairly easy to install. I'm wondering if the springs are strong enough to keep them attached at 65mph.
B0049U04PI|5|Works beautifully!
B004HJNFM0|4|decent gloves , hard armored knuckles , small vents on each finger , soft piping around the cuff , a three inch velcro fastener , you should order one size up , they run a little small . good gloves . 4 stars .
B00NEL6HK4|5|Excellent filter,and yes it does fit right in if you know how to put it in properly.
B0096UAZ6E|5|excellent
B000M8O04M|5|GOOD STUFF
B00GY5RKNU|5|Nice mirror little hard to fit at first but now that its on love it.
B007VR86UG|5|Stopped leak
B001TJBDIE|4|Good product, but was shipped without applicator or spicket.
B00E841D2I|3|It didnt fit perfectly i had to make two holes for better fit!!!
B008N8ILQG|5|Great product
B002RRKW4I|4|As this was the first time I used this product and I was very happy with the outcome so 4 stars,  even though i only needed 14 inches and bought a full roll I was disappointed that I did not realize it came in the color black and I needed white. I also ended up with 2 rolls not knowing I ordered 2 rolls of black and my RV is white therefore I give website 2 stars for confusion as I wish I had white and now have to figure how I'm going to use the black.
B000EQDYUI|5|Arrived earlier than expected. Is as described.  Works perfectly. Just haven't had any rain yet to make sure.
B00AUJ9DB8|4|did the job as expected, although a little bent afterward, but still useful and a good buy
B00DQU9XMC|3|Not waterproof,  lightweight  easy to handle.
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Bought a new 2015 Silverado 3500 SRW. I ordered the splash guards from the dealer as they look good and have a little logo. Well to my horror they require drilling in the most sensitive area of the truck for corrosion in the northeast. I promptly returned them and sought out another option. I found these and a direct competitor on various websites. I chose the Weather tech because of the no drill fastening system. These went on about 5 min per wheel are very solid and fit perfectly. I am more than pleased.
B004BTKZME|3|Throttle sticks now with this part from no throttle to light throttle application
B00VNJ3NFQ|1|These seats are great if you don't mind voiding any warranty due to all the built in seniors in the factory seats
B0058J4M5C|2|These tail lights are a ripoff not smoked at all. They look decent on the truck but not the product i thought i bought
B000CPI5Z0|5|I used two bottles of this in my Bentley Arnage Red Label as it has a very large fuel tank. About a 10% increase in gas mileage, but a significant increase in acceleration and the engine runs smoother.  The engine is an L2 Rolls-Royce 6.7 litre turbocharged.  I would recommend for almost any gasoline vehicle.  I normally use Shell Vpower 93 octane in the vehicle and the Red Line helped with engine smoothness and acceleration.
B00FYX21SM|4|On my Rav4 2015 it's just about 4 inches short on the depth.  The length is more than enough :)
B00OQP8JEO|5|Insanely bright. And the plastic covers can be pulled off if you dont want to use the diffuser.
B005MZX03C|4|Like it on my car!
B003NBFKDK|2|Not as sturdy as some others I've seen,
B00QKX4G06|5|Just bolt on pluged in and ready to go. Awesome, great quality.
B00ECTRBHA|3|Not that great. They remind me of the puffy stickers we grew up with as kids. I would prefer a flat sticker. Too childish like..
B003CJWQAS|1|The seal started to leak right away
B000C55MMY|5|Smoother ride plus extra payload. Put these on my 1986 f250 and it vastly improved the ride. But tricky to put on. I would highly recommend this product
B000GU5IH4|5|Great cover for the money.....
B00O83T4C0|4|tail lights came on time,but 1 light had corner piece of len broken (small). Over all it looks nice.
B0041M98CY|5|Finding gmb to be just  as good or better than most local parts store house brand
B00Q1F20BU|5|great product-only issue was packing was not considered.  These ramps are heavy and they banged around in transport and arrived damaged.  Damaging the paint and bending corners.  Nothing one can't fix, but that's not the point...it's the thought that goes into serving the customer professionally.
B003WOWAFO|5|This is a nice quality mirror that I used to watch skiers on my new pontoon boat. This is a good quality deal.
B00W4XNQ16|5|These key chains are so nice!!  I love that you get a set of two because I like to keep my house keys, gym keys, storage keys (my heavy keys) on one key chain and my car keys on another key chain so there's not a lot of weight hanging while in the ignition of my SUV. This is the perfect solution to that issue.  The fact there is two different colors is also great because if you keep one and give one to a family member or spouse you won't ever get them mixed up laying them down in the same household. Also, I was impressed with how sturdy and durable the leather and the key rings were on both of these key chains.  I really like this set a lot and may purchase some for family around the holidays.  If you're looking for a gift or a nice key chain for yourself you can't go wrong with this set. I highly recommend.<br /><br />I received this product for free or for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
B0043DSGX8|3|This clamp does not fit 2.5 inch exhaust pipe, the clamp is way too small.
B001Y8LA74|5|Soft on the feet, and we bring less dirt into the camper now.
B00D1CQVIY|4|Great price for wiring harness. Only reason didn't give 5 star rating is description needs to have wire gauge listed. Wire size too small gauge for 30 amp fuse included in holder
B000I16PPK|5|Tool was very inexpensive and worked perfectly ,91 wrangler
B000VKG1CA|5|Fit great. Be careful because these are for 2wd, not 4wd. The hardest thing about replacing these was removing the old bearings. Some coaxing and WD40 the old ones popped off, new ones went on with no problem. Watch Youtube, some good educational videos. I have a 2008 2wd Silverado with 80K miles.
B003S1RQ2S|5|I purchased the battery for my security system. I've had it a couple of months and it's doing what I would expect. Time will tell.
B000VUAMQQ|5|i have a polaris sportsman with extra bumpers and a big box on the back and this thing fits like a glove. thick and sturdy. Im happy with it
B00DPI4WAS|5|Arrived promptly & car is wearing it already
B00T31P5MU|5|Perfect replacement for my 2008 Trailblazer. Picked up a # 8 external TORX socket  at the auto parts store and it was a breeze to aim them. (Bought both left and right side)
B00QO70NJ6|5|Very nice switch, looks great.
B0056JBJXC|5|It looks great on my car
B00VM8DPYC|1|Pure garbage. Does not fit my motorcycle at all. Product comes directly from China. DO NOT BUY.
B005JZOKO8|5|Nice
B00AZZV842|5|Great OEM replacement and it's a snap to install. The hazard symbol lights up too which is cool
B001UC9EYK|1|All good for what it is but it isn't used on the 06 f150.
B005PY40GG|4|Installed way faster than I thought. Looks great. Now let's see how they wear.
B0002SR4Q8|5|Need to take of a uber stuck oil filter ? This is your tool. Somehow my filter got torqued down by the hulk. Tried all sorts of hacks and YouTube tricks. The only thing that worked was this. Lesson one only hand tighten your filters but if it is stuck this is the tool to use.
B00NM4GZKU|5|It was a great gift selected by my daughter to give to her boyfriend.
B00PEXGJE4|3|Not bad...you need to make sure they are tight and/or use zip ties on the end so they don't float of move to much.
B00M17RRBU|2|The parts are OEM parts the same as the ones that a Hyundai dealer would sell you at far lower price point.  The drawback is that they shipped from The Republic of Korea and it took literally more than a month and tracking of your order is non-existent!  Nothing wrong with the product, however it is a sad commentary on Hyundai that they have always known that these door handles on the 2010 Sonata models were defective but will not fix the problem if the cars are beyond 60K miles (even though they should).  You also do have to have them painted to match your car and unless you know body work someone will need to install the painted ones on the car.  We never got an estimate on the work that was under $500.  That is TOO MUCH!!!!!!!
B000VEKRTE|5|Product looks exactly like the discription and where so easy for my husband to install!
B00KH2X8W8|5|Great product
B005R4L25Q|5|Lights work good easy to hook up and easy to go back to stock If I would decide to
B0030ICO3U|5|Great product
B00CNI1SDA|3|I put this on some leather in my car. After a few days in the hot sun you would think it would soak in, but instead there was a shiny surface. I cleaned the shiny surface off with Lexol leather cleaner, and followed it up with Lexol leather conditioner, and the result was pretty good. But I think I could have got to the good result using just the Lexol leather conditioner. This is basically a bottle of oil, and oil is good for leather, so it is not going to do your leather any harm. However you may need to use this as part of an overall strategy for leather softening and preservation, rather than thinking of it as a one-step cure all.
B003CJZ41G|5|Bought these for the rear of my 2010 BMW R1200R because I was pleased with the same pads on the front of my old '07 R1200RT. They have not disappointed me. Less grabby and more feel than EBC HH pads. More bite than the stock pads. Happy.
B004TADG7Q|5|Cant go wrong with the fit and finish as they are made by Mopar. Super easy install. Just dont drive the bolt in caveman style as these are plastic. Genuinely makes your factory bumper look aftermarket. Very pleased.
B0012INT98|1|makes too much noise with the wind when on the road. It is big enough and durable material but honestly I regret the buy.
B0095FANCG|2|First of all...This oil is the recommended stuff for my aging Porsche Cayman.  Otherwise, I wouldn't pay $13 per quart for any oil.  Next, bought it from a place called &#34;Wholesale Performance&#34;  The package came today.  Stout cardboard box undamaged.  Inside, a MOUNTAIN of styrofoam peanuts...Hate the things.  Then another stout, undamaged cardboard box that had oil marks on the bottom.  Icing on the cake was that at least one of the quart bottles had leaked in the case.  Not a lot, but 4 or 5 bottles are wet to the touch.  The tops were on the plastic bottles loosely and one of the tamper-evident foil things must be leaking.<br /><br />My first Joe Gibbs experience and not a very good one.  Doesn't speak well for their quality systems.  I think this is a small company started by a racer that gets fancy prices for oil and doesn't have experience in large scale packaging processes.  These sorts of bottles are generally super-tight.
B00E3A018O|5|Product worked well
B00H6XPZN6|5|Love these! Perfect for my baby
B007HRN650|5|Did what I wanted it to do ,Good product
B00HQ6XRLA|5|I found it to be a superior product, and it is working great on my Chevy Blazer!  The price was great too!!
B000QS2XQK|5|No complaints with operation. Very simple to use. Only drawback is that the carrying case could be made a little more durable. It is not stiff enough to serve as a base for the scale. If you are in field environment, on dirt or uneven surfaces, you will need a small board or plate to set the scale on to get good measurements.
B0019COQ6C|5|Not quite as powerful as my BIG hand pump (@100psi), but fast!  EXTREMELY well built.  Note: if you need more PSI, your earthmover trunion pins need pulled out and cleaned/groove turned.  Best grease gun I bought in 40 years, love it!
B001JT19GK|2|What I ordered and what is pictured is purple. What arrived was blue.
B00ERXG4TM|5|Worked great
B00BWU6Z5Q|5|Good decal, image is exactly as shown. And it is small (correct dimensions listed).:) very happy!
B00AQ478QE|5|worked great!!
B002UC8UL2|4|Had to trim it to fit but worked like the original.
B001NZFCRW|5|If you follow the mixing instructions you will look at the solution and think &#34;that doesn't look strong enough&#34;.  Resist the urge to add more chemical.  It works very well at removing foreign debris from the windshield
B00P1G9WY8|5|on time shipping and fit as it should, my b6 avant idles perfectly with this kit. 034 means quality.
B007TG7IKI|1|Just stick with factory.  I have tried Bosch and various other blades, but have had to go back to the OEM blade for each of my cars.
B003YMX0OY|5|It solve my problem and thank you very much 5 star ... Fit and working nice
B001CF3IZ6|5|Fit perfect. 94 wrangler. Drilling is required though.
B0013V6NBA|5|Love it.  Great quality at a low price.
B00NITVMCA|4|This is my third set of All-Weather 3D floor mat.  I gave the other two five star but this one does not fit well for my 2009 Corolla S.  Leaving a big hole next to the gas cap release in the driver side.
B007PSRF0I|5|I Love it. It is strong and sexy...
B00OJXT032|1|DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I have reinstalled my conventional bulbs. I parked in front of my garage door and turned these on and I had to get out of the truck and look directly at the lights to see if they were on. They didn't even light up the door from 3 feet away.
B00BT1UNR4|1|JUNK
B00979NOWQ|5|Good Item Highly Recommended Happy With Item
B0013ERRSK|5|We have been using these for the dogs during travel, at shows, in the car, you name it, for a long time and I wouldn't recommend any other travel bowl/bottle.
B000HE6H3S|5|Its tranny oil line, not much to say. It works
B005ASY23I|4|As an air compressor once overcome or deal with its limitations this is fantastic.  Electrical cord and air hose is short.  If you have a long car or truck reaching your rear tires maybe impossible.
B000E3EXH4|5|Awesome! They fit perfectly and look as though they came with my new car. Would definitely purchase again
B000CG9058|5|Just what I was looking for
B00UEWT0XC|5|These lights look reel good on my truck  I will buy this again.
B00A1X9AES|5|Not much else can be said that hasn't been said before. But these are very good quality long lasting oil filters. I was previously using K&N oil filters but soon realized that they began to make their products cheaper in quality and made in China. Well I came to my senses and did the math, buying these Thailand made filters are<br />by far more economical in every way. Use quality oil and these will last 6500miles easily. Don't use this info as a recommendation but it's what I use on my 2012 Tacoma and Mobile 1 5W-30 Synthetic oil and she runs like a beast all year.
B00ZOH97XU|5|This is an excellent product at first glance. I'll attempt to put up a follow up review once I have put the car back on the road. My expectations are more consistent back to back dyno results.
B00FI0MS34|5|Flexible, bendable, and Comes with a lifetime warranty perfect. Unlike the heavy duty version which is strong but if you put too much force it snaps.
B0010E00T6|5|It was past time for a new filter and this one fit in the '03 Accord sedan (4-cyl) with no problems at all.  The light fragrance is nice and the cabin of my car seems fresh.
B007Q146HO|5|Arrived as said & promptly
B0040RIBY6|5|This is a great way to let others know that you have a student driver and to (hopefully) exhibit a little patience.  It easily sticks to your outside window and stays on.
B000C9QG70|5|this is my favorite air cleaner i got a tenth of the price the store had it im very pleased,
B001GRWD74|4|Item is as described. Fits 2007 Acura MDX perfect. I was thrown off a bit when I saw &#34;made in Germany&#34; however after further research noticed not all products were made in America- with regards to whether product was real or fake weather tech. Installation was pretty easy, had to use a bit of force for the front windows. My only complaint was that the items appears a bit scratched, more like swirls found on dark colors vehicle that goes to a car wash.
B00HE1FT86|4|I purchased this after the mirror off my truck was stolen.  First thing, it was so much more affordable ordering it than going to an actual auto parts retailer. It fits perfectly. The installation was extremely simple. My only complaint is that it doesn’t seem to stay in place as well as the original and it fell off twice, luckily it didn’t hit the ground since it had the plug. That was an easy fix with some Velcro strips.
B001EOV492|5|Excellent product...well made..heavy duty....
B00PGCV4HK|5|Fits perfect great product.
B003VASRCE|4|Great support- you definitely need to be a contortionist to put this in place and adjust- if I had to do it again I would get the ones that ratchet.
B004IU42U2|5|Nice chairs very comfy....
B005N53C9I|1|I ordered 2 one was perfect 1 was defective. Had to return. What a waste of time
B0094B5E66|5|Good fitment.... I didn't use the hardware or stock clips I screwed it directly into the metal so it fit flush without a gap.... Which isn't the spoilers fault
B00V52RE0Q|3|Doesn't stick well to tank
B009DJY546|5|Bumper slipped right on the car just as it was supposed too.
B000CEO7LM|5|Take note of the size!!  6.8 != 6.9  (it doesn't say 6.9 in the title, but I didn't think to look when I was ordering - I just assumed they'd be the same)
B011W6G0LI|5|working great
B00GWEY0YA|4|Works fairly well, though they do have a little bit of flex to them.  Can also be difficult to find a good spot to attach jumper cables to (depending the cables I guess)
B004ZF4MW8|5|I have tried several brand. Some more expensive than others. I have never noticed the difference between them in final results. I usually buy the 5K or 6K color temp to be the closest to daylight color balance. Past that they start to look too blue. If you have never had Xenon bulbs for your car your missing out. I put these on my parents cars because their night vision was not what it was 20 years ago. This did the trick!!!
B002EVWDNU|5|Easy to use and cleaned up really nice!
B000M5Y72A|5|Love them I got new lenses for my car too and with the lights makes a world of difference on a 14 year old car.
B007H8DKJG|4|Good fitment and quality
B003U086XK|5|Good quality emblem.
B0048J2VTW|5|This part is a+.  Built strong.  Perfect fit. Just take broken one out pop new one in
B00WW1O8H6|5|I am 5'4 and have proportionate hands to my body size. I wear a size 7 ring. The gloves fit great, and feel secure. Great item for the price. Can't wait to use them!
