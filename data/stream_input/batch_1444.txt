B002L6O1RE|1.0|This is not the first time Amz has sent a product badly packaged. But if you are reading this review, you'll be shocked if I say that this limited edition and delicate steelbook was sent loose in a bubble mailer to my country WITHOUT any padding at all that is thousands of miles away form America. Needless to say, what I received was a crushed piece of metal with a broken disc inside. That is their level. International Buyers Beware - Worst Packaging and Customer Service Ahead!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is a God!!!!!! truly amazing! I would kiss the creator of this app!!!!! works perfectly couldn't ask for amymore!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not a lot to say about it.  It works fine...it's not world peace or anything but in the realm of solitare there is nothing wrong with it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the price is right and it is a great time waster. good looking game, but it gets a little slow with a lot of characters on the screen.
0307352145|4.0|I liked this book. And when I read sections in full to my daughter, age 13 and a confirmed introvert, she only said, \\"That's me. That's me. They are writing about me.\\" It's comforting to know someone out there both gets it and can eloquently write about it -- with studies to back up the information. We are not all made the same nor should we strive to become such. And while I agree that challenging ourselves and our children by pushing outside comfortable boundaries can reap real rewards and often lead to growth, it can also backfire, and miserably, making future challenges that much more impossible to overcome.<br /><br />It's great to celebrate our differences -- and capitalize on them. Everyone can contribute in their own way. Conformity while great in theory, makes for pretty dull table conversation. I do confess to liking the first half of the book better than the second -- but did enjoy reading the personal profiles dotting the back text to illustrate a point here and there. I did sometimes find myself skimming but the book aptly makes its point -- and the suggestions with regard to educating our youth, school administrators might do well to consider.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|this app asks you for a 40 meg. upgrade and you are not allowed to even get in. i have a kinde fire and advise you to NOT buy this app. this is a waste of money.
B002R25THI|5.0|arkin is composed as an projection of the darkness that submerges his blinded prey, in dark mirrored glasses, smooth and equally dark hair, cut in a sharpened bang, dissonantly formal black shoes, and a tightly fitted black leather jacket...but as a personification of constricting darkness he is much better than memorable...audrey plays off of every character perfectly...ciao.
0446677450|5.0|This book is well written and easy to understand.  It provides a shift in the way you view money.  I would highly recommend this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|omg great game!I love it! even though I fudge up a lot, its still a great game. the only bad thing is that when you stop pressing the left/right button, you kinda slide. ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THE GAME=)
0345803485|4.0|love the book, price and shipping were great!!!!!!!!<br />i went back and purchased the second and third books also, i love them, they are great
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I got this game 4my ego 4g. Now it,'s on my wife,'s kindle fire. Love this game. But it froze after I reached the final wave and started a 2nd round with huge upgrades. Lost the upgrades. Gonna do it again!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Last update ruined it, it wasn't bad before that. I have a lot of personal stories and docs I convert to MOBI and have in my Kindle reader and it used to work fine but now everything shows up as unknown and i have to unauthorize my device and then reauthorize it to get them to show up properly. It would also be nice if you could give the Kindle the ability to read subfolders within the Kindle directory so that those of us with a lot of books and documents and who like to keep things organized can organize them how we want on our device.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|game is awesome, and you are wrong if you say you have to shut it off to get out of it.
B0072OFOM6|1.0|the first season and the prequel were extremely good... plot, acting, everything. My expetacions towards the second season were high but... there are too many gore and blood (it seems that they wanted to give us \\"more and more\\" but sometimes is not for the best), it feels that the new actor didn't suffer trough all the madness of the first season, it seems that he took vacations and is well rested. The new actress portraying naevia is a horror. The only episode I felt a bit of the emotion is when gannicus; doctore and crixus were in the arena fighting.<br /><br />I hope the producers invest more in the plot and in godd actors instead of computer animated scenes in the next seasons
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I liked Delirium, but the 2nd book was 10 times better than the first. Usually the 2nd book isn't as interesting or exciting, but I could not put this book down! I loved how it moved back and forth from \\"then\\" and \\"now\\". I loved the Julian character.... a lot more than even Alex. I won't spoil anything, but I know how I hope the third book turns out. I will preorder it as soon as it is available. The writing was so descriptive and captivating... I just can't say enough good things about this talented author. My only complaint is the use of the \\"f\\" word a few times. I wish she had left that out. I would rate the book PG13 due to the language.
B00284G2JE|5.0|sleeps holy mountain is one of those timeless classic heavy metal records that rarly comes around. from start to finsih this album delivers like it was 1972 again. does this band remind me of the first classic 6 albums by the almighy black sabbath? o boy, does it ever. all the riffs on this cd are over the top heavy. its got a sludgy downtuned feel while still containing melody in alot of areas. matt pike is an awesome guitar player.(check him out in high on fire too). i swear every song is amazing, heavy, and classic. i think my favorite tracks are the druid and evil gypsy. sleep is in my top ten favorite metal bands of all time, and this record is probably in my top 40 of all genres and of all time periods. even though i was only 4 when this record came out i can still appreciate it fully. sleeps holy mountain is finally starting to get the recognition it deserves. if you dig sleep, check out kyuss, acid bath, high on fire, and down. have a good day guys.later
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read the first 2 in the trilogy and am hooked. AWESOME books. Definitely not for prudes, though! Must have an open mind! :-)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games. I think that a lot of people would like it too. the best game is the one bouncing a soccer ball.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I saw this app and I thought, FINALLY! I payed 0.99 for sketch with friends then deleted it. I play this on my iPad, and my brother got the bought version with a gift card, but then I saw it free, and I loved Amazon. Thank you OMGPOP!!!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time. It was recommended to me by my aunt and 13 year old cousin her were reading it for a book club some months ago but I just brushed it aside. Eventually I heard all the hype, and gave in. I can not say enough great things about the originality and writing style of this book!
B0000E5PEE|4.0|If you are a fan of Ennio's work, you will enjoy.<br />Even if you don't understand anything but English, it is still beautiful music.<br />I bought this specificly for one song, Your Love, but was not disappointed with the rest.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I heard about this book on NPR.  I read a lot of mystery/thrillers, and found The Expats to be one of the few that keeps me guessing until the end.  I really liked the twist that all the characters were not who they appeared to be.  Looking forward to more from this author.
B004GYY714|5.0|this thing is a pretty decent little app. I have been looking for one that has Jake f.m. on it and its the only one I have found out of 23 apps...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The app is OK. i was hoping for a little more, but its actually kinda fun (: but overall, its not my favorite game. i'd give this about 3 stars!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This series is great once yo get into it! May take a little while to understand all the characters, but it is a whole other world.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|this app is so cool! you should get it. listen to me get the app. I use it all the time
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love the game. fun new levels around every corner! fun! fun! fun! so so glad I got this game. love it.
0439023513|4.0|Some good things in this finale, and some bad things. On the one hand, lots more about the world of Panem and its people, the continuation of The Hunger Games' condemnation/examination of media manipulation and of never being able to trust what you see and who you work with, and lots and lots of attention to how ambiguous, awful, and impossible to recover from being a war hero must be. On the other hand--the last section of the book. What the hell? What kind of defense system is that? Who would design that? How would you maintain the resources to keep all of that up and ready to go? Does the Capitol hire unhinged video game designers for its defense contracting?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To borrow words from reviewer 'An older man on truckling': \\"James' strong suit is her ability to elicit sympathy in the protagonist.\\" And, just as 'An older man', \\"I wanted to find out what happened to Anastasia, and that lent the story a compelling, page-turning quality. . . Her dialogue is crisp, her prose poised, and her paragraphs well-parsed.\\"<br /><br />That being said, I found myself immersed in a story of BDSM erotica that is able to keep a body thrumming throughout the read - which I did in one afternoon and evening. Is this subject matter something that I would consider for myself? NOT IN THIS LIFE TIME.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to begin \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\".
B00005RDRO|4.0|I thought it was a very entertaining movie. Just sit back and relax and take in the simple humor. I love the cast of actors and actresses like Peter Falk, Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|AWESOME GAME. best defense type game on the market. you play a character while controlling an army. love the images and how responsive it is. would recommend to anyone out there. Evo 1st gen
B001N3GUIE|2.0|Here is the {Bottom-Line} on the Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />The Video portion is just fine.<br /><br />The Audio that is suppose to be as I recall in 5.1 Surround is, \\"Pitiful\\".<br /><br />Sorry folks but you might as well here it the way it is before you order the Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into the Movie in regards to the Special effects etc.<br />I think all of us know about that.<br />The real question that should be answered in this Review is about the Blu-Ray and if it is Good or Bad.<br /><br />Terry Honaker
B00005N6KG|1.0|Not impressed. I went out to a store and found a much more comfortable pair of headphones. Ordering this particular product was a futile waste of my time. They are now just sitting on a shelf collecting dust!
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you liked the Star Trek movies certainly buy this set.<br /><br />Plus 5-Stars !!!<br /><br />The Video & Audio are A-Plus.<br /><br />Some of the Movies are better than others but all are certainly OK.<br /><br />I'm glad I purchased the set.<br />Would purchase again.<br /><br />Terry Honaker
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book, I read in a week. It's a very intriguing and sexy read. I'm on the third book now... love the story :)
B0058VW36U|1.0|Used to be good, but the latest update has added in-app purchasing.  I'm sorry, but I cannot give a good rating to a pay app that expects you to pay again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|IF YOUR LOOKING FOR WAYS TO SPICE UP THE BEDROOM OR KEEP FANTASIES ALIVE THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. NOT THE BEST WRITING IN THE WORLD ( gets redudndant in the detail factor) BUT MR C.

0670022950|5.0|This is a very important book. I have it in MP3 format, and almost did not purchase it because the subject seemed too cerebral. Also, a part of me assumed that he was probably wrong in his conclusion. Well, I am here to tell you that I was riveted to this book thru the full 35 hours of narration, frequently revisiting compelling passages to see if I heard it right. Pinker has made sense of the things I have witnessed my whole life, but could never see in terms of the bigger flow of life. For example, civil rights for minorities, womens rights, gay rights, animal rights, political correctness, and so on : ALL of these have unfolded in my life, and ALL are steps in the increasing general respect for people and life of all types. Pinker proves with tons of evidence that this is the arc of history for at least the past 500 years. The opening chapters on the history of violence, both personal and state directed, are horrific reminders of just how bad and dangerous the world used to be - and which much of the world is no longer. His chapters about the increase of violence in the 60s (my generation), and the subsequent decline in the 1990s, are a trip to read. I lived thru all of that!<br /><br />It is about time that someone has been able to see what is really happening in our world, not just what we see on CNN and Fox news in the evening, and express that reality with such exquisite language. I am sharing awareness of this book with everyone I know who cares about the world and our future; especially those friends of mine who believe that the world is going 'backwards' in terms of cruelty and violence. It just ain't so. Wonderful news! Read it and feel gratitude, just as Pinker has expressed in his closing. Gratitude...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like this app's features, especially the reminders (and that it is free). Works great on my Kindle Fire. Just wish it didn't require wi-fi to access the Bible.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I looked at a couple of the negative reviews and found them to be bizarre. This is very thoughtful and well-written show that stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of what is currently out there. A couple of people seem to be fixated on the Betty episode which I would agree was the weakest of the first six that I have seen but that is only relative. The other episodes have been among the best of the series with the the further fleshing out and development of the older characters going hand in hand with surprisingly strong and complex new(er) characters such as Megan and Ginsberg, not to mention Mrs. Francis (Henry's mother). I just think that this show continues to be a wonderful window into upheaval of the 1960s that still affects to this day. The early comments do not reflect the high quality of the fifth season at all and are misleading. Update: I just completed watching Episodes 7-11 and found two of the very best episodes ever produced including The Other Woman which really exposes the seamy underbelly of the \\"getting ahead at all costs\\" nature of the world of advertising and of the corporate mindset in general.
B00009R86L|5.0|I have attached this strap to one of those fancy custom camera bags for women and have loaded the bag down with several pounds of lenses and camera bodies. This strap makes carrying them so much easier and more comfortable. I love it!
1451627289|1.0|Burnt souffle. This book is like a dish perfectly created except for fumbling the very last step. The payoff does not work.
1594744769|2.0|as soon as i start reading, i got pulled  in into the book, i thought to myself \\"wow, i found one of those you can't put down book\\", that lasted thru about half of it. Great writing, loved the character development and emotional drama, 2/3 of the book was really great, and that where it should have been done. there is no really ending in this book, it's one of those, finish it as you want, though it's pretty obvious for the outcome.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I ordered the 3-movie set.  I received it very quickly and for a great price.  I've ordered many times from Amazon and because of the great prices and service, I always go there first when looking for items.

B000002HMH|4.0|I'm a fan of metal, and a fan of Metallica. But I'm also a fan of MUSIC. It's easy to argue that Metallica lost some of their heavy metal edge with this album - the guitars aren't as thick, and the album is lacking in speed. However, the actual MUSIC on the album is still just fine. With the Load album, Metallica alienated a lot of fans who weren't already alienated by the Black Album (a masterpiece I might add). Metal purists hate this album - and it is understandable. There are songs that would be rather disheartening to fans of the first four Metallica albums, such as the radio-ready hit singles \\"Until It Sleeps\\" (Metallica's first and only top 10 hit and a rock chart topper) and \\"Hero Of The Day\\" (only peaked at number 60, but also topped the rock chart). Even more disheartening to those fans would be \\"Mama Said,\\" a full-phledged ballad with a country twang to it; at first listen that one came as quite the shock to me. Aside from those really, the material on this album is not all that different from the template they created for a sound on the Black Album, so why the fuss?<br /><br />Personally, I say if you find those 3 particular tracks bad then skip 'em and try and enjoy the rest of it for what it is. The opening trio of \\"Ain't My B*tch,\\" \\"2x4\\" and \\"The House Jack Built\\" all fit right in with the Black Album sound. \\"King Nothing,\\" another hit (only peaked at number 90 but also made it to number 3 on the rock chart), basically sounds like \\"Enter Sandman\\" backwards; I might have a problem with this if not for the fact that it ends with a somewhat humorous nod to that. The remainder of the album does sometimes tend to drag a bit; I will admit that songs like \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" feel a bit overly long. At the same time, there are some brilliant album tracks buried in between them: the bluesy \\"Poor Twisted Me,\\" and the rockin' \\"Wasting My Hate\\" and \\"Thorn Within.\\" The two more bloated compositions slightly weigh the album down, although if I'm in the right mood they will satisfy me. Also, \\"Cure\\" and \\"Ronnie\\" feel kinda like filler, they are among the less memorable tracks in Metallica's catalog.<br /><br />Honestly, after listening to this several times through I just don't understand the fuss. Arguments can be made against this era of Metallica like, \\"They sold out,\\" \\"They cut their hair,\\" \\"They abandoned their roots,\\" \\"It's not a full-on metal album\\" - but I don't care. Metallica's early material is undeniably the best work they put out, but the fact that they were able to move on from it and make music that appeals to a more commercial audience without completely destroying themselves in the process says a lot. Load, if taken for what it is, is not a GREAT album by any means. But it is a GOOD album, at the very least, and one that should not be shunned as it is by so many people who swear by the first four albums.the right mood they will satisfy me.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book.  The best part about it is that when you are done with it, you can move on to Book #2 in the trilogy!  I was worried it might be too graphic or gory for my taste, but it is perfectly balanced.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|im more of a suspense, thriller reader and decided to give this a go based on the ratings.. im so glad that i did - i absolutely thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that really surprised me.<br />her characters are spot on.. i loved her family who were so interesting yet so normal...<br />will and his family also were well rounded and well written.<br />its a wonderful story of love and hope and laughter and sadness...<br />louisa is quirky, interesting and yet so normal that any girl who is a little bit insecure can relate to her..
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app.  Helps keep your mind occupied while waiting for appointments or just to relax and shut out the rest of the world.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not read Romance, if that is the genre into which this book falls, and this is not a great way to persuade me. I went into this book with such high expectations after hearing all of the hype construed by what I consider \\"reputable\\" media sources. I have even heard people say they are so taken with Grey's psychiatric issues and how he \\"evolves.\\" Please. If you are looking for a book that stimulates your mind, look elsewhere. This was a waste of my valuable time.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This app must have changed over time because the numbers and buttons are huge and easy to use.<br /><br />This calculator is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  All the functions work exactly like they should. The history option is awesome.<br /><br />Please don't succomb to feature creep temptations.  You know what I mean, where companies start with an excellent program and keep &quot;enhancing&quot; it until the original function is lost in a sea of &quot;improvements&quot; at which time I go looking for a replacement.<br /><br />An excellent app  thanks
B000JIHP88|4.0|We got this mobile and are overall very pleased with it.<br /><br />When it was about a month old it suddenly stopped working. We called Fischer Price and they sent us a new one. It has been a few months and that one still works great.<br /><br />My son loves it. He has been entranced with it since we got it. He loves the animals as well as the light in the music box. He falls asleep to it almost every night.<br /><br />It is great for keeping LO occupied and happy.
B006BXT4TI|1.0|Man, after hearing them for months on Pandora, I popped for this with a $5.00 Amazon sale - my first non Pandora listen, and I feel gypped. It's not anything like the tracks they're spinning from other albums. It's a shame. I thought I would like them, but this is bubble gum pop with hint of rock and roll blended in the horrid voice killing overmixing. Sad - I really wanted to like this band....
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I didnt even want to put it down. It has so much accion and it keeps you on your toes. Can wait to read the next book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this app is so cool, it has some really fun games and some are quite hard. you get money as a reward(not real money) to winning a game. and when you win a game you can spend your money on other games. this app does have to do with real money but you don't have to play with real money if you don't want to.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|so happy that I can get this now!! ;D thank you people who decide what apps the kindle fire beholds!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Well worth the money. You can set multiple types of alarms (work day, Saturday, Sunday, etc.) and have different settings for each (ring tone, number of snooze, etc.)<br /><br />It's totally geeky to have to solve math problems (multiple difficulty levels, if you are worried) to wake up, but it really DOES help me wake up. After 4 months of daily use, I recommend it highly.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a very well-done app with great instructions on how to get started for new cooks and several dozens of straightforward recipes.  The tips and tricks are very useful too for anyone who cooks.

B005DKLPQ0|4.0|Nice as it is to have all the studio albums remastered and together in one set, why couldn't they have added a rarities bonus disc, and completed the picture?
B0026IUXO2|2.0|This should have been an interesting story.  She's a fascinating character and the movie gave me just enough information to form that opinion, but the entire plot was shallow and lacking.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I chose to read this novel because I wanted to learn more about life in North Korea.  I was not disappointed.  However, the reality is so brutal and so depressing that I must admit that I only read about half the book before abandoning it.  I always knew that the regime was oppressive but some of the horror scenes that will forever stick in my mind and haunt my dreams are worse than I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of a young man who is considered an orphan, even though he had a father who ran an orphanage.  Orphans, in North Korea, are treated horribly, given the worst jobs in the orphanage and later used as little more than beasts of burden and cannon fodder in an unfeeling and cruel world.<br /><br />The narrator works on a ship and some of the first scenes in the book are scenes of how the Koreans kidnap Japanese citizens from a beach.  But the horrors get worse as we learn about slave labor, torture, and a world that is incredibly cruel.  Reading this book was like one long screech of despair.  I found it unbelievable and horrible.<br /><br />And then, just this week, I read an article about North Korea in The Economist and I realized that everything depicted in the novel was based on reality.  I shudder at the horror.  I mourn for the people who are condemned to live their lives in this world of repression and fear,  And I could not read another word.  It was just too sad.
B007Q476KU|3.0|This is a unique and fresh movie about the bond between a young man and a horse that costs his family almost everything. This is special for those who love horses.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A person can critique a book on its character development, sentence structure, grammar, etc.  I can go head to head with any lit snob about various aspects of this book; but in the end, a story is just a story. And this is a great story. I would like to one day meet that one person who would come up to me, shake my hand, tell me she's my greatest fan, and then say, \\"And Sassy says hello.\\"<br />Read it. Enjoy it.
0061433047|4.0|Tiffany Aching is a young woman serving as the witch for the Chalk, a stretch of countryside in an alternative universe. Tiffany serves her flock with devotion, even though she is viewed with as much suspicion as respect. When the occasional suspicions turn into a more pervasive threat, Tiffany begins to worry. She finds help in the big city--Ankh-Morpork--when she goes their on a separate mission to bring news to the new Baron of his father's death.<br /><br />Tiffany is a charming character, and the humor that pervades this book is indeed uproarious. The Week folk and their antics are similarly amusing. I'd read one other Discworld book previously, which was often hilarious, but also very confusing. This was much clearer to a reader unfamiliar with the series. I enjoyed the book thoroughly. Mature topics of life-and-death, etc. suggest a readership of at least 15 or 16 years of age.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app is a lot of fun, its easy to pick up and play . comes with free updates its worth your money.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Since the first day I put it on, my Garmin 405 has been an incredible tool to aid me in my fitness. It is easy to use, very interactive and the fact that I simply walk into my home and it transfers my data to both the Garmin site and Runkeeper.com with little or no effort is fantastic! Highly recommend!!

B005LAIHE0|3.0|The movie is mainly a comedy yet it has an edge if you look closely. There are a myriad of different takes in how you view it. Some of it felt dark but always with the comedy overlining it. The things I liked about it were, the carefree easy way the main characters were together, they had a bond which felt like not being alone but really with a partner. They had fun together and allowed themselves to show silliness and playfulness. I liked the Pink Bunny Costume and kind of the flat affect that went along with it, at the couple's first encounter. I liked when the male lead tried to find himself hunting, letting everything fall apart in a funny way. I don't like to kill animals but I think it would be fun to hunt animals that are not alive so you could have the experience. I liked when he made a hunting feast even though his guests weren't in the spirit of the party, although he wasn't either although he was still using his creativity. I liked the big cups that looked like coconuts and the big serving utensils with the animal skins on them. The big bowl of wild game stew. It was fun. I liked when he went and stuffed himself with all kinds of beautiful wedding cakes, different colors and tastes. He made friends that were in touch with their feminine sides. I also love fresh orange juice, and I loved the tinkling champagne glasses with everflowing beautiful juice. The movie is easy to watch and could help some unwind. The acting is done by good comedic choices.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have been waiting for this film for over 30 years and It was well worth the wait! Having viewed the film over 8 times in the theater, have to say that it doesnt get old. Everytime I see something that I missed the first viewing. Those of you who have large screen TVs will enjoy the full edge to edge action filling the screen in every shot.<br />The two best things I can relate from taking friends and family to see the film was one My 75yr old mother's comment that \\"John Carter was the best film I had seen since the first Star Wars in 77\\" (she is now reading all of the John Carter books) and my best friend Shanon who said she hates Sci-Fi movies and loved the movie so much that she named her next rescue dog Dejah!<br />Dont let bad press keep you from owning the best film of the year! Take your Face out of a Book and Take Me Back To Barsoom!
0345803485|1.0|This book is disturbing - the author using child abuse and torture as a vehicle for eroticism is repulsive.<br /><br />Besides, even if there were less violence, it is just a horribly written novel. The characters are unbelieveable, the story line lame. Are we supposed to really believe that this 21 year old college graduate has never kissed anyone yet willingly becomes a sympathic submissive?  The author has a fascination with pain, and well, she created a painful experience for this reader that hopefully others will not have to endure.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is NOT a romance novel.  Of the two main characters, one is an abusive man and the other is an insecure, desperate woman who thinks she's in love.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I almost had a fit when I found out I had 3 months to wait for the second book! It's a fictional story not a text book! Lighten up people!! It's for fun not education! I think Harkness did pretty darn good for a first novel and I completely enjoyed it. I have already pre-ordered book 2! I do tend to pick out typos and mistakes in books but I do not let that take away from the experience. I read to escape to different & interesting places with different & interesting people, for me, this book did that and I loved it! I would love to see all these people that pick apart writers' books based on nit-picky errors, write their own books and see how their reviews are! I have 3 different degrees, most certainly am NOT an idiot and I KNOW I couldn't write a novel!! Kudos to all authors who DO give it a shot! Keep right on writing!!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|One of the hardest parts about watching a movie like this is knowing how the season turns out.  If the movie was not made for another 10 years, the end may not be as predictable.  More time could have been spent on character development, but good film anyway.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I downloaded this book to my Kindle.  So easy to find and purchase (I had an Amazon gift card).  Great book!<br />I was also able to read it on my Droid.
0345803493|5.0|My Review:<br />This book was completely shocking to me as the second book in a three-book series, because it did not follow along the prescribed novel arc that a second book normally follows. For all practical purposes, this is the Happily Ever After book (which is normally the final book.) I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop like it did in Book #1 and it never did...and it was totally refreshing in that fact.<br /><br />In this book, Christian and Ana have settled into a real relationship. He's accepted the fact that she is his girlfriend and that she is not going to play the sub to his Dom. There are still lots of challenges between the two of them. OMG, Christian is a complicated character, but for the most part this book is about their relationship and the development of it.<br /><br />They are learning each other and how to be in a relationship which is completely new for both of them. Ana was innocent coming into this, but so was Christian in that he's NEVER had a real honest-to-god relationship. They are both learning their boundaries and each other throughout this book.<br /><br />This book remains as hot as ever and Christian is volatile as ever, but throughout this book, he has more of a vulnerability about him. He definitely seems younger in this book, which honestly just puts him at his age. Such a good series and that's simply because these characters are written so incredibly well. It's just riveting reading!

B0000C23DO|3.0|While it might come as a shock to many, there is a group of older people, who took their fair share of mind altering substances, who just were not big fans of the Dead.Personally,I always found them to be lacking a competent vocalist,an above average instrumentalist, and found their extended jams somewhat snooze enducing.<br /><br />This is not to say however,that they were totally incapable of some decent songwriting on occasion. Rhino has managed to compile the best of these recordings on this CD. While the flaws mentioned above are certainly evident on these tracks, the songwriting is strong enough to still cause them to be relevent.And the remastered sound quality is very nice indeed.<br /><br />A good CD for those who want a taste of the Dead in their record collection, but dont want to mull through the rest of their stuff to collect the better songs. I own this, and Blues For Allah, thats as dead as I care to be.
0345803485|5.0|My Review:<br />A<br />I don't plan to write a really long review because I figure most of it's already been said about this book. Before we read this book, we were discussing it at my writers' meeting and someone said they heard it actually wasn't written all that well. When I first started the book, I had to concur. There is a stilted, awkwardness to the writing, but the entire book is told from the heroine, Ana's, POV and she is a stilted awkward person in a lot of the circumstances that she finds herself in. As a result, the style of the prose really works. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose or not, but the entire book is entirely compelling and riveting.<br /><br />The hero in the book, Christian Grey, is such a scarred person. There are just hints at what his childhood (i.e. formative years) involved and those glimpses are horrific especially when you consider his proclivities. And they are definitely the reason that he is the way he is...extremely controlling and domineering. He's young...only 27 years old and I like that fact in this story line. I'm not sure I would like him as well if he were older. There are moments when his youth shines through and you get to see the man he might have been if he hadn't had the childhood he did.<br /><br />The heroine of the book, Ana, is a different case. There are aspects of her that are completely unbelievable. She's graduating from college and completely innocent...to the point that she's never held hands or kissed a man before (at least that's what this book basically said...later books say differently...a minor inconsistency). I could deal with the virginity, but I just can't believe the other two aspects especially since she has no particular hang-ups about sex. It's just a little too outside the realm of believability for me with an attractive college-age girl.<br /><br />Like I said before, this book is incredibly compelling and I think that all comes down to these two characters. They both are written brilliantly. Within the book, we live in Ana's head so everything is skewed from her point of view. She's enthralled by Christian, but more than a little horrified by what Christian is proposing and that she's even considering it. In case you haven't heard the hype from this book, he is very into BDSM...not a mild thing for an inexperienced girl. Her reactions are so honest and genuine....I loved her observations of the world and the split personality she sometimes develops between her inner goddess and her subconscious.<br /><br />The book ended with a cliffhanger and even though it was midnight, I immediately had to download book #2 and read the first few chapters simply so I could sleep. The first book was amazing and I am pretty sure I will be reading the next two today. Eyeing the review pile which is going to suffer for it, but these books are so good. I simply can't resist....much like Christian Grey himself.ntly. Within the book, we live in Ana's head so everything is skewed from her point of view.

B003QS9WIE|4.0|Just watched 'The Prestige' again on cable for the 2nd time today in April 2012, i have rediscovered a gem of a film in this masterpiece. Initial released in 2006, and very much marketed like the over commercialized and packaged hollywood movie, (how could it not be with Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman), i watched it with a 'great' pinch of salt back in 2006. Finding it pretty 'run of house' hollywood.<br /><br />Watching it again today, i saw the movie in a total different light which spurred me on to write a review for this well-deserving movie. The movie will definitely go into my top 50 list of greatest movie ever made based on story, acting performances and scripting.<br /><br />Many reviewed that the sci fi element in the film (Angier discovering the human duplicating machine) was the downfall of the film, i however beg to different on this opinion. The film needed this 'out of the world' element to push it to another level of intrigue and intensity.<br /><br />Although one cannot argue with Christopher Nolans direction and \\"correct\\" style of film making, ironically, thats the very thing that is holding me back for giving 'The Prestige' a full 5 stars rating. I still find it a tad too \\"Nolan well made\\" aka hollywoodish. I envision the look of the film turning out much darker and moodier perhaps with more erratic camera work which would have taken the film to another level of mystique.<br /><br />Summing up... Great performances and entertaining twists in the film makes 'The Prestige' a highly recommended watch for the mystery and thriller genre fans out there which will keep you intrigue and guessing all way till the end of the movie.

0345803507|5.0|My Review:<br />OMG, I love this series!!! All the books have been wonderful, but this final book...OMG! The beginning of this book starts a little slow, but the second half reads like a suspense novel. I loved that.<br /><br />In this book, Ana and Christian are married. The book starts off on their honeymoon with a few flashbacks into scenes we've missed since the end of book #2. Overall, they are in a good place. They have their minor issues when Christian has an over-the-top reaction, but they've learned to talk through these for the most part. They are learning to have a truly functional healthy relationship.<br /><br />Yep, then something happens, but I am not going to say anything more about this besides the fact that I have read these scenes at least 3-4 times since I finished the book. Emotional doesn't even begin to cover it... for EVERYONE!<br /><br />The series....the characters in this series are so complex and the basis of the story line is really harsh stuff. Christian has some serious mental issues that are based from a really traumatic childhood that he experienced up to the age of four. Then, as a teenager, not knowing how to cope, he was taught coping skills through a Dom/sub relationship that never should have been. Honestly, he was too young for that kind of relationship. He is definitely fifty shades of messed up and has the fifty personalities to go with it. Ana talks about him being mercurial and she is so right.<br /><br />It's serious issues that this book series deals with, but in the midst of it all, E L James manages to insert humor and fun and LOVE. With the wonderfully fun and insightful emails between Ana and Christian to the internal quips and actions of Ana's inner goddess, there are moments when you can't help but to smile and giggle as you read. Then there are such beautiful, romantic, heartrending moments between the two. It just leaves you gasping for more.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to fathom how E L James started to work with Christian's character. He's so complex and mentally scarred from his horrific childhood. So many times he can be really harsh, but at the same time, she manages to keep him as a character that you still love. With the fact that these books are written entirely from Ana's point of view, I am astounded with her skill in that.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ana is such a strong character. In the first book, she starts out as this vulnerable, shy, inexperienced young woman, but as the books progress, she finds her inner-strength and uses that to connect to Christian. She fights for their love and truly for Christian's sanity. Together their characters are dynamic and, I've said it before...JUST RIVETING. You get caught up in their story and their love and it's just gorgeous.<br /><br />These books are erotic and there is a LOT of sex, but for me, I connected to the love story and the complexity of the characters. I understand now why these books have been so incredibly popular. Just an amazing series.ith Christian's character. He's so complex and mentally scarred from his horrific childhood.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I was surprised this was released to DVD so soon after being in the theaters.  This was a fantastic movie which followed the book better than most Hollywood adaptations.  The casting was well done for Mikael and Lisbeth.  I even prefer this version to the original Swedish version of the film.  I can't wait for the new two!!!!

0307951529|4.0|\\"The $100 Startup: Reinvent The Way You Make A Living, Do What You Love, And Create A New Future\\" by Chris Guillebeau is an interesting and informative book for those who are or want to be entrepreneurs.  It is not about a specific business that you can start for $100, but rather a book about a new model of doing business that the author calls a microbusiness revolution, or a way of earning a good living while crafting a life of independence and purpose.<br /><br />The two themes in the book are freedom and value.  The author states that we are all looking for freedom and value is the way to achieve it.  The book is then filled with case studies of people who have done just that.  They have obtained freedom through creating value for others.  While the author uses personal examples, he also uses many examples from the research he's done on people who have created businesses, with little start up costs, but provided value to others in a way that enabled them to grow the business and provide the lifestyle they desired.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not a get rich quick book.  Building a business takes work, and lots of it.  However, the author believes (and so do I) that you can transition to a meaningful life oriented toward something you love to do and make money doing it.  Others have done it, and this book shows the path they took.  The author's premise is that you can also follow this path to create the freedom you crave.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, the first, \\"Unexpected Entrepreneurs\\" contains five chapters that deal with Renaissance, Give Them the Fish, Follow You Passion...Maybe, The Rise of the Roaming Entrepreneur, and The New Demographics.  There is some good advice in these chapters, especially in regards to figuring out what you will do, and how not everything will be a great business.  Reality checking is important.<br /><br />Part Two, \\"Taking It To The Streets\\" has five chapters that deal with The One-Page Business Plan, An Offer You Can't Refuse, Launch, Hustling: The Gentle Art of Self-Promotion, and Show Me the Money.  One of the things I really liked in part two was the motivation to act.  Planning is important and good, but you must act.  The author shares his one-page business plan worksheet.<br /><br />The third part, \\"Leverage And Next Steps\\" contains the final four chapters on Moving On Up, How to Franchise Yourself, going Long, and But What If I Fail?  Again, this part has some good information for some people in certain businesses.  My favorite line was at the end of the book when the author says the most important lesson in the whole book is \\"Don't waste your time living someone else's life.<br /><br />The book also points to on-line resources to help further the guidance this book provides.  Overall, I found the book motivating, and containing some valuable information for the would be entrepreneur who wants more freedom.  The world is changing and the way people do business is changing.  This book will help you ride the wave of that change.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain B.

B003G4W49C|1.0|Good day, I love science fiction and have heard many good reviews of this book, along with the upcoming movie release. However, I will not spend my money on this author due to his virulent anti-gay ideology. I am gay myself and my spouse and I have been together for 12 years; four of which officially married in California. I believe that everyone is entitled to their opinion and free speech as I am entitled to not send money to this author whom turns around and uses that money against me and my spouse. Card has publicly stated that granting gay couples equality will coincide with the end of democracy in this country. He has publicly stated that gays are simply victims of rape and/or molestation as children. We are damaged humans.<br />It saddens me that such a great sci-fi author would be so hateful towards a particular group of his fellow humans. Additionaly, he is giving Mormons a bad rap with his homophobic rants. My spouse and I live in Arizona and know many Mormons whom have never been hateful towards us. Actually, these Mormon friends have actually supported gay equality unlike Mr. Card.<br />So if you are gay or are straight with gay family members or friends or neighbors, please think twice before purchasing anything written or associated with Mr. Card. In a capitalistic democracy, the best way we can voice our displeasure with his ideology is not to spend money on his products. Then maybe he will get the message that America is a nation

B004J8HWS2|4.0|This is a work of historical fiction. A true event in history with a fictional plot wrapped around it. In this case, the first ascent of Mt. Everest by the Englishman, George Mallory.<br /><br />The novel opens with a team finding a body on the slopes of Everest and one of the team members searching inside the clothing of the body looking for a picture of Mallory's wife. Mallory always climbed with a picture of his wife in his jacket pocket. Upon finding no picture, the prologue ends there and the novel begins. Note, the finding of no picture doesn't mean this isn't Mallory. (pure Archer)<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer can hold my attention like no other author. I'm immersed by the end of the first chapter and held there until the turn of the final page. His characters are so rich and always intellectual which, by osmosis or something, has his works imparting knowledge onto you and you don't even realize it.<br /><br />I'm running out of Archer's works to read but I'm excited he has announced a further 3 more works of his saga: The Clifton Chronicles.<br /><br />Great read, pure Archer. Highly recommended.

0399230033|5.0|This is one of my favorite books to give to new or expectant parents.  There are few words (just the guard saying goodnight to all the animals at the zoo); it's what's going on behind his back that makes it a delightful story about a mischievous gorilla.  The illustrations are wonderful.  Look for the balloon in the background on all the pages.  All four of my kids (now ages 10-15) adored this book when they were little.  It's a keeper.  Look for Officer Buckle and Gloria, another wonderful picture book by the same author.  More for toddlers, but my 10-yr old still likes to read it!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I got this for my kindle fire and its a pretty cool game, took me about a week to complete it. Lol it was a little frustrating at times cause I think it has a few glitches like when jumping there was sometimes a short lag and it causes you to die but that's ok. also when you get game over it takes you all the way back to the first stage of the level you are on and that drives me crazy haha but once you do a level 3 or 4 times you can start to memorize it and it gets easier. sometimes frustrating but otherwise a fun game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was so excited it was finally out. but after downloading, the game wont open... at all :/ maybe it needs to be fixed, or maybe its my kindle. I played this on an ipod and loved it. anyone know Boston fix it?
B006OOHYIC|2.0|I read the reviews for this game and purchased the game based on those reviews. Regret paying the 99 cents. I find the game to be boring.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games as my first ever Kindle read and purchase. Just loved the book and it became addictive. Read the trilogy in a week-haven't read a book in a few years!! Have started many paper books but just haven't finished them. Heard about the Hunger Games and thought to myself that is something I wouldn't want to read or see! I was definitely mistaken. Couldn't wait to finish book one and get the other two.<br />The Kindle was a gift for my birthday and I just love it. I think it is easier to read than a paper book.
0451196716|1.0|My husband is a fan of Stephen King, he has an entire collection, so I started reading this book... personally, I like to know why things happen so I can be interested. I figured I would eventually find out while I was reading, but it kept dragging over and over about the same thing that had no reason to happen at all. I kept waiting and expecting for it to get better, but it was just more of the same. The kids on the book are just walking and getting killed for no reason, yet they sign up for it and are very excited about it... ???? So I just kept wondering why everyone in the book was so dumb, and continued reading. The book has good ideas, and of course I think it is a predecessor to The Hunger Games, but this \\"story\\" is very disappointing. It just narrates people walking and getting killed. I continued reading anyway, then started skipping pages, until I gave up and asked my husband to tell me about the ending (because I skipped to the end and the book just stops). So he explained that THAT was the whole idea, to keep you wondering. Oooooh God I'm so glad I didn't continue reading until the end. It was such a waste of time! So to summarize this, the book is pointless, boring, dumb and a waste of time. He should've never released this book without trying to make some sense of it all.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|This book is being compared to 50 Shades for good reasons. It's story line is similar to 50 shades of grey. I thought that there were some areas, in terms of character development that could have been better. It felt like we're going from meeting, to sex, to relationship, to undying love all in one breath! Where's the build up? Where's the getting to know you phase? There really wasn't any of that in this book.<br /><br />Was a good enough read to buy. Yes, I don't regret that, I just wish that the characters, who are complicated in their own right, had been developed more and presented in a way that you felt that you knew them.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a great book, action packed that keeps you hanging until the VERY end!!  Many books are reviewed by people who have never read them and have issues with the author, ignore them, BUY THIS BOOK, Two thumbs up!!
B004TPXVKS|5.0|Wow is all I can say when I hear this LP, well the 1st 4 LP's actually give me goosebumps. I am so glad I am a fan, and...the ONLY problem, with this CD is...A Annoying STICKER some idiot put ON the COVER of the CD which cannot be peeled off without damage. Dumb Idea. You blocked out a lot of the classic LP. It reminds me of Pink Floyds collection of 1st 2 LP's re-released as \\"A Nice Pair\\" This LP shows little block pictures of different things, one being a toad in someones mouth and a very psychedelic hippie sitting on the floor looking at his comic books and you can see several strange things around him...as well with this double album a huge round sticker put over the nude part of a female. This annoyed many people. I do like and always thought the idea someone came up with in late 60's to release \\"X-Rated material\\" or...\\"Reference to drugs and or alcohol\\", etc...anything questionable to be released in a brown paper wrapping to people over the age of 18, etc...But no one would use this until 20 years later...

The characters in this book were so real with their feelings and emotional hangups, the sex scenes were so HOT!! it would leave me drooling over here, you could almost feel yourself in the story itself. When a book moves me like that I know I have read a really good book whose author has put so much feeling and depth into her work. I give praise to you Sylvia for bringing this book to life. I cannot wait for the next book to find out what happens between Gideon and Eva, I could not have asked for a better read. I will definitely be reading more of your work.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|In Time is a futuristic movie where time has literally become the currency for society.<br />The people in the society have to find ways to earn their time in order to subsist or else they die<br />once they \\"run out of time\\" on their imprinted watches once they turn twenty - five. Since the<br />time also functions as currency, the people have to use that time to buy food, money and other<br />necessities all the while worrying about how much time they have until they cease to exist. In<br />Time does a pretty good job representing dystopian ideals but is a bit idealized as a movie.<br /><br /> The movie reflects dystopian ideals by having the society split into two: the ghettos<br />where the bottom of the society preside and the luxurious city - like area where the rich preside.<br />The people from the ghettos struggle to earn enough time to subsist but the people from the<br />luxurious city - like area live their days without a worry about time. The dystopian society<br />functions in a similar way where there is the bottom of the society(majority of the population)<br />whom struggle to maintain a living and the top(minority of the population) who have more than<br />they even need to live. The society of In Time maintains a control on the bottom class of the<br />society by never allowing them to have the ability to get out of their own time zone and even if<br />they were able to become a little richer, the prices of goods would just raise in order to maintain<br />the large gap between the two classes, which reflects dystopian ideals.<br /><br /> The movie also reflects dystopian ideals by having the currency actually become time.<br />Because currency represents time, the people from the ghettos have to constantly struggle in<br />order to live another day all the while having to pay for food and other necessities that also<br />contribute to survival. The society has exerted a kind of control on the people in this society by<br />having them constantly worrying about their own time that they can't worry about anyone else's,<br />save the people they are really close to such as family members and close friends. Throughout<br />the movie we see the occasional dead bodies in the ghettos that the people cannot feel sorry for<br />as the people are constantly worrying about their own time and how they are going to get<br />through the day. The dystopian society also maintains a control on the people by having them<br />become less sympathetic to those around them as the people have to worry about how they are<br />going to get through the days as well because time is essentially money - even if time isn't<br />currency in the dystopian society, money is needed in order for that time to really be worth<br />having.<br /><br /> However, the movie is also a bit idealized. It seemed so easy for the two main characters<br />Will and Sylvia to rob the time banks so easily and distribute it among the people of the ghettos.<br />Usually in the dystopian fiction \\"resistance is futile\\" - the ones who try to go against the<br />dystopian society will usually be caught and punished. In all honestly I was expecting an ending<br />where the two protagonists would be caught eventually and the society would have been what it<br />always was. The ending was a bit idealized where the people in the ghettos were actually able to<br />escape their own time zones and the two protagonists were able to actually make a change in the<br />system of the society.<br /><br /> All in all, In Time is a movie that reflects the dystopian ideals. The film's society in this<br />is split into two: the few very rich and many very poor, which is how the dystopian society is<br />usually structured and also shows how the people in the ghettos have become less sympathetic to<br />those who also suffer the same fate as them. However, the film is also a bit idealized with how<br />easy it was for the characters to rob the time banks without having to suffer inthe end. In Time<br />would have been a very good dystopian film if not for its idealizations.
B001DE29SS|4.0|i just adore robert downey jrs work as both a singer and an ACTOR. he truly has done some AWESOME work. i am so glad he is clean and sober and i hope he and his family have the best before them. AND you really must listen to his music. BUT his work in this movie should have gotten him an award as he truly hits chaplin on the nose
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book and storyline were riveting.  The characters were clearly defined allowing you to love/hate or both their roles within the story.  Surprizes lie around every corner and you will find the book difficult to put down. I opted to buy this book since I was unfamiliar with the plot (originally I thought it was another vampire triology). As soon as I finished this first book of the trilogy, I purchased the other 2 books.  Be smart and purchase the trilogy at a reduced price right up front. Enjoy.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I know the critics did not like the movie.  I LOVED the film.  It is a women's film, and that is probably why the critics were so negative about it.  Just like they were about \\"Eat, Love, Pray.\\"<br /><br />Madonna took the iconic figures for true love of the 20th Century - Wallis and Edward, and takes a compassionate look at the couple.  At the same time their love story is related to the present-day story of a woman trapped in marriage to a selfish and abusive albeit successful doctor.<br /><br />The film tells the stories of being trapped inside of relationships, and women seeking emancipatory experiences, much like \\"Eat, Love, Pray.\\"  Evidently these are themes of little interest to today's outlook which still values women as wives and mothers, above all else.
B0053TMP24|5.0|this book is awsome. its full of adventure romsance suspence and the classic percy jackson we all know and love.i loved this book so much im antiously waiting for book three to come out.
B004DK49DW|5.0|I was just walking through the store the other day and this CD just happen to catch my eye.  I thought to myself, \\"Hey, these are the guys that sang that killer tune \\"Bad Luck\\" way back when.  That's like 20 years ago,,,and their still a band?!  So i remembered how much i loved \\"Bad Luck\\" and decided to buy this on a impulse buy. I gotta tell ya, this CD kicks ass!  Since then I have gone out and bought the 2 solo CD's by mike ness and those kick ass also!  So now im in the process of basically picking up all of Socials CD's.  So basically, I'm a new fan of SD and Mike Ness.
0439023513|4.0|My husband read these books first. He told me how much he enjoyed reading them and after reading them told me about how much he wanted to see the movies. He just was curious about if they were able to convey the book through the movie. So, after a while of listening to him telling me about how diappointed he would be if we didn't see the movie on the big screen, I figured it was time that I read the books.<br />  The first two books had me trapped. I couldn't do anything but read them. It was almost as if I had to finish them as quickly as possible. I was just that wrapped up in them. I felt almost like I was on the Horrible Journey with Katniss. As I read each word, I actually began to see things through her point of view. And, I could understand it. It was written in such a way that I could feel her emotion as I read the books. I zipped through each book wanting to get to the next one just as quickly. Then I got to mockingjay. I can't believe that this is written by the same author. The books seems devoid of emotion. There wasn't any emotion in the writing which really did reflect upon the characters as well. I found myself wanted the book to just be over, which was a contrast from the first two books which I didn't want to end. The books to me seems forced, like she was just going through the motions of writing a book because she was on a deadline and needed to be done with it.<br />  Someone had posted on the forums if there was a re-write what would we like to see different? What I would like to see different is bring back some of the emotion from the first two books, stop wasting peoples time with having Katniss be this whiney person. If you want to show her struggle then show it..... if you want to write her as a wreck thats fine too but commit to it, explain it, make me understand it. Don't just flip flop between it all because you feel forced to have the book end. I understand the need to create drama in a book and kill off characters... it makes for interesting reading... but, some of the character get killed in a very flippant manner and then there's nothing. NOTHING. no response. there isn't even a written explaination about the character ignoring what happened. The over all plot of the book I didn't mind... it was just the lack of the fire or passion of the first two books seems to be lacking in this one. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I loved the first two that much.

1400032717|3.0|I read some professional reviews of this book before deciding to read it, and have read some more after reading (as well as many Amazon customer reviews) and I've had an interesting realization. The central conceit of this book provokes a level of fascinating discussion that the book itself doesn't really earn or deserve. That is, it's more interesting to talk about the book and its implications than to actually read it.<br /><br />It would surprise me if this were the first book to adopt an autistic person's point of view, but that seems to be what has everyone talking. My issue is that this tact presents some formidable challenges to any writer who attempts it, and I don't think Haddon really succeeds. For example, one of the main traits of an autistic person is a lack of empathy; they have a difficult time connecting with others. That doesn't mean they don't have feelings, because they certainly do, but they lack the ability to recognize those feelings in others or to express their own feelings in ways appropriate to the non-autistic world. This all makes someone like Christopher a difficult character to like, at least in the context of a novel. Of course I'm not saying that it's impossible to like or love an actual autistic person. But as written in this book, I found it ultimately too trying to empathize with a person who displays no empathy, to the point that he appears quite cruel in certain moments. This in itself is very interesting; is it possible to empathize with someone who cannot empathize with you? Would that violate the definition of \\"empathy\\"? Or does empathy possess some kind of transitive property?<br /><br />The author often makes pit stops, interrupting the narrative to have Christopher explain what preoccupies his thoughts, mostly because he retreats into his own complex inner world in times of stress or fear. Christopher is fascinated by math and logic most of all, so at many times the book digresses to explain a math problem or logical riddle, complete with diagrams. At first this seems refreshing, an interesting departure from traditional narrative writing, but as the book goes on it becomes suspect and tiresome. Maybe this is how the author intended to instill empathy for Christopher in the reader - as if these things would make us think, \\"What interesting thoughts Christopher has beneath his difficult exterior - what a neat kid!\\" It didn't work like that for me. As more and more of these episodes pile up, it begins to seem cheap and gimmicky, as if Haddon is simply using the stereotypical autistic preoccupation with math and logic as an excuse to thrill the reader with neat facts, stories and riddles, the kinds of things that might appear as sidebars in a science magazine. It takes on a too-cute quality, and in the last third of the book, it even becomes kind of maddening. Important things are happening to Christopher, and he keeps interrupting the flow of the plot to retreat into more of these math problems. It stops being interesting and seems superfluous and almost disrespectful of the reader - a kind of crude and taunting way to build suspense.<br /><br />Autistic people tend to be quite literal and pedantic when they speak or explain things, and Christopher is this way throughout the book. His voice as a narrator is extremely pedantic, and like the little logic/math vignettes I describe above, this got increasingly old for me as the book went on. This is one of the challenges I mentioned, that I don't think Haddon quite rose up to: how do you accurately portray a character who thinks and speaks pedantically, without alienating or irritating the reader at some point?<br /><br />Another challenge in this book: how does the writer make subtext and emotional content apparent to the reader, when the voice of the book is unaware of these things? Sometimes Haddon succeeds in this, and these are the most potent moments of the book. Yes, at times there are impactful flashes of emotion and complex sadnessthat surface. In the first half of the book I felt conflicted sympathy for Christopher's father, and his mother and their trials. But there's not enough of this stuff shining through the superficially obtuse, cutesy, pedantic way Haddon chooses to present Christopher's voice. The plot of the book itself is pretty simplistic, and plays it safe. In the end, I feel Haddon was never aiming that high to begin with. I feel he began with a novel concept - why not write a story from an autistic point of view? - and he did just that, but *only* that. He didn't sort out some of the messier by-products of that approach. He tells a simple story with a novel point of view and uses the autistic conceit to present us with some \\"interesting\\" science vignettes along the way. That just isn't enough, not for me.<br /><br />I think this would have worked better as a longish short story or novella; limiting the length would have prevented the above problems from being such an issue. Perhaps he could have alternated Christopher's point of view with his father's point of view? That might have been pretty great, actually. As it is, this book doesn't handle things as well as similar novels like Flowers for Algernon or Forrest Gump. Like \\"Life of Pi,\\" it's a long and problematic children's story masquerading as adult popular literature.
B0076D20E8|3.0|If you are the type of viewer swept up in fantastic sets and costumes, then \\"Anonymous\\" will prove entertaining.  If you are looking for an outstanding story or extraordinary acting, then look somewhere else.<br /><br />I was terrifically disappointed in the performance of Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth, and kept wondering why Glenda Jackson could not have been lured away from the British Parliament.  Redgrave made for a sad, pathetic Queen E the first.  The performance was poor.<br /><br />The story wasn't very good either.  It rather got out of hand by making Oxford not only the lover but also the son of the queen.  How ridiculous!  If Queen Elizabeth is going to be a main character in the film, she should have not been turned into such a ludicrous creature.
0345803485|2.0|I was amazed at the sensation over this book. It is mildly interesting while being very predictable. That part was no huge shock as it is very formula - innocent girl falls for dashing bad boy. But whay surprized me was the level of writing. The inner goddess was over the top. The same scene played out over and over again.
0670022950|5.0|The breadth that Dr. Pinker has attempted to cover is astounding.  He nearly makes it there.  This systematic discussion of trends in violence is a comprehensive, readable and thoroughly enjoyable analysis.  It reminds readers of the disconnects between the media's fascination with violence and the fact that violence has declined dramatically over time.  Strongly recommend reading this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this portion of the trilogy.  The characters picked up right where they left off in the Hunger Games.  Recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so many of my friends discussing this book and the trilogy so I had to read it to see what the hype was about.  'Wow' doesn't even begin to cover my thoughts.  I began reading the book on a Wednesday evening and by that Sunday I had already finished the entire trilogy.  The books are amazing!  And \\"oh my\\" what it has done for my husband and I.  You should definitely not read this book if you are close-minded against sexual experimentation.  But if this is something you are into or are at least open to learning about, this book is for you.  Can't wait to see the movie (EL James has already sold the movie rights to Universal Studios) and hopefully more installments of Fifty Shades of Grey.  There has to be more, right?
B007JRU2UK|5.0|I never before held George Clooney in high esteem regarding his acting, but \\"The Descendants\\" gave me a new respect for the actor.  Clooney was awesome and the story is so well-written.  Loved it!
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I didn't realise a book meant for teenagers could give me such a thrill. After reading The Hunger Games and watching the movie, I thought the sequel would be an anti-climax; instead I just couldn't finished Catching Fire fast enough to get on to The Mockingjay !

B000001ESJ|4.0|After the make-or-break success of 2112, Rush followed this up with a record that features a few longer tracks mixed in with some exceptional shorter, albeit powerful songs that culminates in a record that remains one of my top 5 favorites from them. The opening title track is well structured and written and shows off the dexterity and cohesiveness of Geddy, Alex and Neil and provides a great song within the growing Rush catalogue. Xanadu is somewhat of a mini-epic number along with the album's closer Cygnus X-1 which further displays growth and musicianship while paying special homage in parts(with the growing addition of keyboards), to some of their contemporaries like Yes and Genesis, proving that Rush were coveting the prog-rock mantle, while also stamping out their own creative niche and archetypal sound of style. Closer to the Heart and Cinderella Man are the most accessible tracks featured and display the more melodic and commercial side the group had to offer within the wealth of this fine set of material. Kings features a perfect balance of melodic songwriting, impeccable musicianship and a taste for improvisation that is wrapped up rather nicely and sustains the band accordingly. For people whom are new to Rush, I strongly suggest to begin with this record as it features something for everyone to experience what the band is about: perfectly competent and exceptional playing styles matched with an uncanny talent for innovative and original songcrafting. 4 solid stars
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Overall, I love Alabama Shakes but a lot of the music on here came across a bit 'pop' for me.  Apparently I had heard the best of that singer and band... and much of the album is actually grating to my ears.<br /><br />I do recommend it but listen on iTunes to the songs to see what you think. Any 'different' group deserves to be supported and so go for it if you just want some new music with a f++king great singer!!
B000I186FW|5.0|V for very, as in very entertaining; very well done special effects; and very thought provoking. The cast and crew did an excellent job in bringing this story life. The storyline is highly plausible in today's world of political and social extremism. Set in the not to distant future, a religious fanatic and his neo-fascist party come to power on the wave of a mysterious virus and begin their campaign to subvert freedoms in all its forms. The first to go are those it considers \\"different\\" or non-conformists. Who will be next? Your friends? Your family? You? An outstanding movie with a strong underlining and relevant social theme.
1401937268|5.0|I could not wait until I received these cards in the mail.  This is absolutely one of the best Tarot decks that I have ever owned.  I also own John Holland's: Psychic Tarot, and I love it to and he also did a great job on this deck; however, there was one flaw...he did not include the court cards, which are very important when you are doing a reading.  Doreen Virtue, Radleigh Valentine, and the wonderful artist Steve Roberts included them: King/Queen/Knight/Page of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire.  Court cards are very important in a reading because they could shed light on something about yourself, or someone that may come into the questionnaire's life.  I love how Doreen Virtue, et. al.  also had different colors for the different four elements: Fire=Red Air=Blue Earth=Hunter Green, Water=Turquoise Blue, and the Major Arcana was illustrated with a color purple, which indictates deep spiritual matters. I also love how Doreen included archangels for each of the major arcana cards that corresponds to each of those issues and how you can ask for their assistance with those deep spiritual matters.  Additionally, I think that it is also great how she tied in the different metaphysical beings in the following ways to represent the different suits of the Tarot: Mermaids, Dolphins, and Ocean Waves=Water (Cups); Unicorns=Air (Swords)...(NO FORMS OF NEGATIVITY LIKE 10 Swords stuck in the back of a dead bloody victim...or a heart with 3 swords piercing into its top); Fairies=Earth (Pentacles/Coins); and Elementals and Dragons=Fire (Rods/Wands).  Finally, I loved how at the bottom of each card it has a generalized meaning or description of the card, which helps a novice to the Tarot learn the true meaning of the cards.  Also, Doreen mentions in her guidebook about the two cards that were restored in their appropriate order from the time that the original Tarot was done by Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Coleman Smith.  I love Doreen Virtue and the great lightwork that she does forthis planet.  She could not have picked a better group of helpers such as Radleigh Valentine and the acclaimed artist Steven A. Roberts to help her with the creation of these cards.  They are absolutely wonderful and just stunning work!  I am very impressed with this work, and I am looking forward in November when Doreen comes out with Mary Queen of Angels Oracle Cards.  Thanks Doreen, Radleigh, and Steven for your tremendous work!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love that they made this for kindle! played it on bf's cell at first much better on the kindle Bc there's more room to draw. the only thing I would suggest would b a cancel button for creating a game. I press create game sometimes and it take a little longer than other times and id rather just cancel it so it dosn't mess up the other games. other than that it runs smoothly and very fast.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Its been years since I've really been into the music of VH and I openly admit to being a bigger fan of the Roth era than the Hagar era, even though with Sammy they produced some great material(5150, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge). But, that notwithstanding, once Eddie and Alex reunited with Roth in 2007 and adding Eddie's son Wolfgang in place of Michael Anthony on bass, I was skeptical as to whether or not they would be able to stay together long enough to produce a proper VH release that would be respectable and worthy of the legacy they had built in the past. Despite the fact that alot of the material comes from older demos and outtakes, even dating back to before they were signed to Warner Bros. in '77, the material here recalls alot of familiar ground and is suprisingly refreshing to witness once the cd begins playing. Tattoo is actually a grower of a leadoff track and becomes better with each rotation. Blood and Fire and The Trouble with Never are sustaining tracks that anchor the record and consolidate the gains from the impetus behind this comeback release. My Personal favorites are You and Your Blues, Big River, Beats Workin' and Bullethead which all recall moments from the 6 records done with Roth and offer up a bevvy of KickA$$ heavy rock in the process!! Other tracks worthy of mention on the heavier side of things are the somewhat progressive Chinatown, As Is and the explosive Outta Space. Though Roth's voice may not be what it once was, he still maintains a vibe and aura that cannot be matched by anyone and as a result, Truth is sustained as a success because of his involvement.<br /><br />Its a trip to hear VH still maintaining itself as a force that is still powerful and relevant within today's ever changing trends and styles of music and its comforting to know that the guys are still making quality music. Stay Frosty Fella's!! 4 Solid Stars
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This movie is daunting. You HAVE to watch it to the very end to fully appreciate what it's about. I've seen all of the 'long and boring' reviews. These people are not to be listened to if there is any vestige of true intelligence beyond blood, guts and crude sex that I'd bet most of them are into. This is one of those films about something, and it isn't 9/11 either. That is simply a backdrop to the story. This is about fear and loss through the eyes of a boy with problems. He's clearly not normal as you watch his obnoxious behavior. That's exactly. I remember watching and thinking to myself that this boy is really getting on my nerves. As I went through it, I started to understand him and his issues. People with no sympathy for a kid with this sickness are just irritated. They aren't looking, or trying to look, under the surface. He only had a connection with his dad in a world that was strange and scary to him. He found his mom and vice versa in the end. There's much more also. Good movie.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book was perfect for my severe Hunger Games withdrawl! I loved it from the beginning. Lena is very believeable and relateable. There were a lot of moments when I tried putting myself in her shoes and found myself saying \\"Yeah, I'd react the same way\\"<br /><br />She's not the strongest or most likely heroine but she is honest and innocent, that means something and it's refreshing to watch her transformation (especially carried into the second book). Her romance with Alex feels pure, if a little quick paced, but it definitely makes you relive your first love. I love seeing Lena grow and become the heroine we hope she'll be from the beginning.<br /><br />I love this series and can't wait for me! Now I need to find a cure for my Delirium withdrawl!! :)
1401924751|5.0|Just another great deck created by the wonderful Doreen Virtue.  This deck provides great insight into one's life purpose.  I am glad that she created a deck like this.  This deck along with the Romance oracle cards, The Archangel Michael Oracle Cards, and The Archangel Raphael Cards really helps when you use your Angel Guidance Board to help shed more light on any deep questions that you may have. I must have for anyone trying to discover what direction to go in their life purpose or career search.  Thanks Doreen for your great work!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game, good waist of time. only problem is an objective that requires social media to complete., just wanna play
B000002JSJ|3.0|Presence represents Zeppelin past their creative peak, but the group still manage to whip out a collection of songs that are quite solid and still contain alot of ambient power and majesty that recalls some of their former glory days. Opening with Achilles Last Stand, Jimmy Page's craft of overdubbing his guitar melodies is, once more, to the fore here and builds this number along with the powerful kit playing of Bonham, John Paul Jones' steady bass and Robert Plant's familiar vocal voicings which play off of Page further into the duration of the number. For Your Life is a mid-paced track that has a touch of blues and a slow boogie rhythm attached to its arrangement, but also provides space for Page to stretch out and the track benefits from his invigorous guitar lines. Royal Orleans is a bit more uptempo, but still retains a boogie feel and lyrically was inspired by John Paul Jones' trip to the cajun country infamous French Quarter in New Orleans; its slightly derivative, but is a bit of fun for the band as the feel is musically loose, but also driven by the power of Bonham's drumming.<br /><br />Nobody's Fault But Mine retreads the familiar blues base of what made Zeppelin such an important rock institution while also showing off the core of the group's collective powers amongst Page's ambient guitars, Plant's intertwined voicings and Bonham duly accentuating the track's stop-start rhythm patterns. The track would feature along with Achilles' as more of the prominent features on the subsquent '77 and '79 touring shows and provides Zep with stronger latter day material to mix within the setlists. Candy Store Rock has a somewhat rockabilly rave-up quality about it and has a touch of filler within the song cycle of the record. Hots on for Nowhere echcoes a bit of the style of Royal Orleans, previously, and has a bouncy melodic vibe about it that makes for a refreshing listen and further drives the vibe of the record which, taken in overall, brings Presence as a simple and basic release that strips down the sometimes, overblown arrangements that adorned prior Zep albums like Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. Tea for One is the record's closer, and once again, Zep conjures up a longer track that returns to the blues for inspiration and although it features more blistering leads from Page, it is also a track that is seemingly lost in the shuffle of quality Zeppelin material, oftentimes looked over, and when it is discovered, becomes a powerful unsung hero in the Zeppelin catalogue.<br /><br />I find Presence as a satisfying release and while its clear that the band had peaked creatively on the hodge-podge double set Physical Graffiti, Presence shows the pure muscle and heart of the band even though the material may be berefit of quality songwriting to match the instrumentation involved. Still, Presence contains a slow, brimming power to it that can ultimately draw you into the simplistic, yet solid qualitiies of the aura of an aging, but still pioneering group of its time. 3 and a half stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome! I am a fan of the Twilight Saga and this is a similar adult version. I couldnt put it down!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Usually a the second book in a series never lives up to the first but I almost think that Pandemonium surpasses Delirium. We see Lena continue to grow. She is stronger and harder but I never felt like we lost out old Lena, she's in there, just a little sad and angry. I wasn't too sure about the new love interest but it was done very well, I didn't feel like she was betraying Alex or having a \\"rebound\\", it was very genuine for me.<br /><br />Again, for me, Lena is the driving force in the series. I just love her, she's pure and believable. And now she is strong and driven. Watching her grow and growing with her is a great adventure and I can't wait for more!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Sometimes you just need to focus and clear your mind of distraction. This puzzler is excellent for getting to that place. The music is excellent, the levels challenge without being overly frustrating. The price makes this game one of the absolute best values I have seen for any app.

B0024RID6U|4.0|Tattoo You represents a mini-renaissance for the Stones here and even though the majority of the songs stem from outtakes(some go as far back as Goats Head Soup ala Tops), the overall presentation sounds crisp, clear and fresh. Start Me Up provided the band with another anthem to add to the canon of classic material and features an archetypal Richards riff that is instantaneously familiar and profound, coupled with Charlie Watts' mechanical drum beat and the gloriously sloppy harmonies from Jagger, Richards and Wood. Hang Fire is another Chuck Berryesque rocker which features sunny harmonies and biting leads from Ronnie which makes this track succeed most tellingly. Slave dates from Black and Blue and is a funky rocker that lets the Stones jam out a little bit coupled with some great sax work from Sonny Rollins, whom also adds his talents to two other numbers in Neighbors(one of 2 new tracks written for this record) and the album's closer, the carefree and laidback comfort of Waiting on a Friend.<br /><br />Little T&A features Keith on lead vocals and like Happy before it, it is a good old sleaze rocker that's rough around the edges and cooks its way through as an overlooked gem from the band and for Richards in particular. Black Limousine is a derivative blues vamp that chugs along nicely and features a piercing wailing harp accompaniment from Jagger. Worried About You begins with Electric piano and is another Black and Blue outtake that avoids oversentimental traits and succeeds as a midpaced track for the album. The aforementioned Tops came under scrutiny many years later by one Mick Taylor, whom had claimed that the finished track was used on Tattoo You and the Stones failed to acknowledge and credit Taylor for his guitar contributions to the finished track; all parties have since settled the slight and Tops is a track that continues in the vein of the previous Worried About You in its midpaced, somewhat soul flavor. Heaven is the second and final \\"new\\" track tobe included and uses studio trickery and mixing which gives this number an ethereal and dreamlike quality in its structure. As a whole, I find Tattoo You along with Some Girls and to a slight extent, Undercover as being a loose triad of solid and sometimes powerful moments that revealed the Stones in their older age as still remaining somewhat relevant after all these years and still maintaining a strong finger on the pulse for their latter day era. 4 stars

0439023521|1.0|Stephen King gave it a B.  I think he was too kind.  It was an okay book but the hype.... I only read it because of the hype and I'm so glad to be done with it. Now I can get on to reading really good books that have meaning and contribute something.  What a waste of time.  I'm embarrassed that so many people thought it was a great book.  It bothers me that parents and teachers are okay with the premise and violence.  The ending with the dead children coming back as \\"mutts\\"....  did I say \\"stupit\\"?
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I've always enjoyed any movie that Clint Eastwood has appeared in.  This one is definitely one of my favorites.  It accurately reflects the sad situation that this country has allowed to bring upon itself but also shows how friendship exists between different ethnic groups and a supportive nature to each other.  Definitely a good movie to see!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game. has a pay- to - win systrm in place, but it is still a fun game. worth the download.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|The concept behind In Time was amazing. Instead of running on money the people run on time. I found this really ironic because the way we make money is through time, and I think that is something the writer wanted to make very clear to the audience in this intense theoretically dystopian future. Instantly I felt connected to the protagonist Will, always searching for time yet always giving away time as well. The way we run around constantly complaining about how we don't have enough hours in the day, really seemed to be the general theme of it. The society created in the film really embodied a total dystopian society. The System is in complete control of the people, leaving no time for justice. The timekeepers following Will and admit that they have no cares or worries about justice. The system keeps everyone believing everyman for himself and aspires to survive be Darwin's fittest. They people live day by day and in the end want to be the people with the most time and that is why the system is able to maintain its control. The people follow the system because it is all they know. Some people don't even know the system is corrupt, because they see it through blind eyes. The female protagonist Sylvia is a perfect example of the deception the system uses on the people with the time/power. Sylvia is given everything from her father and knows how he does business, but because it is or her family and he what she knows she accepts the corruption as normal. She believes they are free to be or do or have anything because the lifestyle they live is all she knows. Even after she starts to trust will, she still continues to have that want for time, the want that she and will are trying to fight. Although the characters have freedom of most choice, they are still under control of something much more manipulative and controlling than the bureaucracy, technology.  The humans them selves have become pieces of technology. The numbers on their wrists run electronically and are connected to a huge database system. Machines run everything including the humans. The scary idea that the machines are in charge completes a complete scene of dystopia. The people only know what they are taught but they do not look outside the box because they believe they are already so advanced through the technology that controls and runs them. They are also not very free because the people are constantly under video surveillance no matter where, when or why they go giving the machines and the people behind them the control. The citizens have been dehumanized by their constant connection to technology.  They live day by day in an illusion that they are in a comfortable state. The segregation of different age wealth districts, have left the people in fear of other people and places, also keeping the technology in control. In a struggle day by day for time will embodies the hero that can change it all. The film was inspiring and eye opening to certain aspects of our somewhat near dystopian future.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was not a Trekkie fan before this, so I can't say that I know what happened before or after this video and I am not interested in seeing old clips-this however was a wonderful film that engages you-even made me cry in the beginning! There's drama, action, unexpected friendship and even a subtle hint at romance. I would recommend it. 8-) I don't watch films often but this one was entertaining, and you don't need to have watched the rest of the series to understand the story.<br /><br />-Dani.

B0062KJ1Q6|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this movie.  I enjoyed the cast, and although the plot line was simple, the movie did have some laugh out loud moments.  I think you have to have a silly sense of humor to enjoy this, and not take the movie too seriously.
B004FGMV0W|3.0|This has some decent songs and songs that will seem familiar to prior fans--even if they have not heard them. Derivative of prior CDs, it is as if Lavigne just tossed off a carbon copy. One thing Lavigne has failed to do is show a trace of growth. It's the same old, same old--teeny bopper affectations, echoing choruses, casual vulgarities, bizarre rhymes suitable to a teenager and Valley Girl overtones. A good example of some of that is the \\"What the Hell\\" number given air play--the \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\" chorus and the echoed, spoken \\"what? what?\\" in that simpering Valley Girl tone. What was funny on \\"Girlfriend,\\" which had the amusing lyrics to match the affectations, merely seems like a style mindlessly repeated here because she can't think of anything new. It's not bad, indeed it is quite bouncy in places, but in places it also seems more suitable for a 16 year old. In particular, it is not new. While most of it is pleasant enough, there is nothing that seems likely to be as memorable as past hits. The rest just seems to be Lavigne on auto pilot.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Antarctica, winter 1982.  This is a good prequel of the JC's \\"the thing\\".  Of course is not the same as the 1982 version, there is no way to compare both.  Here are some key parts of this prequel if you already know well about JC's version.<br /><br />We know now more about the UFO, but still the movie left behind the key element of the crash, unfortunately Universal decided not to put this part on the film, overruled the Director.  Listen the commentaries.<br />The Thing in this prequel is acting too fast, and sometimes the lack of blood gives us hungry compared with JC's version.<br />The Thing makes sounds not as good as the JC's version, which this can add more tension and suspense in the movie, only the split-face deserved \\"the oscar\\".<br />Yes, Split-face is the best part in the entire movie, ask McReady and Doc if you want to know more about it.<br />Kate gives us more information about the \\"aline cells\\", and provide us a different perspective on how to know if you are infected, and here we know that Childs is human.<br />The end is considered, the bridge between this prequel and JC's, it matches everyhting.  A little fast but well enough to continue watching the other one right away.<br /><br />Just watch it and enjoy them, both versions.  Get a lot of popcorn, drinks and watch them very late at night.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Okay, okay, Bateman/Day/Sudeikis are superb (and ad lib and mesh sensationally), but come on:  Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and a surprisingly hysterical Colin Farrell make HORRIBLE BOSSES the outright side-splitter it is.  Spacey plays an immoral megalomaniac, Anniston a maneating predator, and Farrell a lowlife cokehead; all three are unabashedly over the top, and it pays comedic dividends in spades.  So when Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day is hysterical) are collectively overwhelmed to the point of plotting to kill their bosses, they enlist the aid of a hoodlum (Jamie Foxx, yet another grand enhancement to the cast); and of course, everything goes to Hades in a handcart, making this madcap gem one whale of a fun ride.  Sure, there is locker room humor, and it's rude and crude, but it's done so masterfully it dares you not to belly laugh.<br /><br />Look for cameos by Ron White and Bob Newhart that deliver some grins, and the entire cast deserves kudos for comedic timing, pacing, chemistry, and delivery.  It's nonsensical and out of control; but because the cast obviously isn't taking the story seriously, why should the viewer?  Just roll with the punches and enjoy the nonstop ride; HORRIBLE BOSSES is a comedy that satisfies the funny bone and serves notice that R-rated comedies can be very, very good.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

B005LAIHE0|4.0|Teaming up again in another adult comedy, Nicholas Stoller (director, co-writer) and Jason Segel (co-writer, actor) prove that \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" was no fluke.  They manage to have just the right amount of raunchiness mixed in with over-the-top and subtle humor and enough drama and sweetness to keep most people happy.  Tom (Segel) is a San Francisco chef, on the verge of getting his own restaurant, who proposes to his girlfriend of one year, Violet.  Violet (great as usual Emily Blunt) is an ex-pat Brit working as an educator in the field of psychology.  She obtains a grant to obtain her doctorate at the University of Michigan and Tom gives up his own career opportunity to move with Violet to Ann Arbor.<br /><br />After a struggle with Michigan winters and Tom's inability to get a decent job, he descends to the brink of craziness with the help of a househusband he meets played by Chris Parnell.  Violet on the other hand is very successful, perhaps aided by her boss (Rhys Ifans) who has a crush on her.  Tom and Violet's pre-marital struggles keep the wedding date constantly moving.  Complicating matters is the pressure from both sides of the family.  Violet's London based family is losing aging members left and right and Tom's Jewish-rooted parents are longing for a traditional marriage.<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest pair however is Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt from TV's \\"Parks and Recreation\\") and Violet's sister (Alison Brie from TV's \\"Mad Men\\" and \\"Community\\").  At an early rehearsal dinner the unlikely couple hooks up, quickly marry in a beautifully conceived wedding and have a couple kids before Tom and Violet can pick out their own wedding cake.  The movie runs long at a little over 2 hours which might have been forgivable if we spent a little more time with Alex and Suzie (Brie) or Lauren Weedman's Chef Sally, Tom's lesbian (\\"but I voted against California's gay marriage act\\") boss.  Judd Apatow is one of the producers and we can certainly see his influence.  Ultimately the movie is a worthy addition to the genre, even if we get a little too much of Tom and Violet's Michigan struggles and that the humor misses some of the time.e his influence.

B007RPM1B2|5.0|I loved this entire show. Amazon thank you for having it available for cheap. The quality was great. To the reviewer before mine, Amazon did not cut any time out of the show. It is a 2 hour finale on TV(keep in mind this includes commercials). When you remove the commercials, you are left with the 1 hr 22 min show. Also, it says that the finale includes the opening commentary. So you have a final show and commentary. You might want to edit your review and up the stars :)
6305882592|5.0|I don't really know what I could add to so many positive reviews except to say this:  I saw this movie in the theater when I was in high school because my favorite teacher told me about it.  My best friend and I liked to go to movies so we went and saw it.  We liked it so much that we stayed and watched it 3 times (that was in the days when you could do that) and it was a double feature.  To this day, I don't know what the other movie was.  This movie contains so much about how I feel about life and what is important.  I showed it to some of my nephews when they were around middle school age and said something like, \\"If you want to know what Uncle Steve thinks is important in life, this movie contains most of those things\\".  After we watched it, laughed at all the funny parts and were sad at Maude's death, we talked about it.  They said they could really see how the movie was the same as they knew I felt.  I was glad that they didn't just ignore an old movie or be grossed out because of Maude's age.<br />  Anyway, I still love this movie as much as always and don't forget Cat Stevens.  His music has influencd me just as much as the humor, events and performance.  I listen to Cat Stevens as much as I always have and I pull out Harold and Maude and watch it once in awhile still to this day.<br />  If you have not seen it, watch it.  Especially watch it with your kids and nephews and neices.  There is so much wisdom in it that you, and they, can't help but pick some up.<br /><br />PS: This NOT a black comedy!  It is totaly the opposite.  To me it is very life affirming.
1933633867|5.0|First off, I have read this book and intend to re-read it soon.<br /><br />Reviewers:  I find it interesting on all the quasi-intellectual objections to this book.  Most entertaining are people who can't stand the fact that the author along with doing tremendous research and presenting re-searchable facts actually HAS A POINT OF VIEW.  There is no such thing as a truly disinterested historian that is unbiased.  Subjects like this affect people and peoples lives so to try and write about it without deep down inside having a point of view is absurd to even consider and really you are comparing fellow humans on the same lines the AUTHOR laid about as basically self-interested, calculating robots.  It really just shows were the reviewers are coming from and their POINT OF VIEW.<br /><br />Many of these reviewers are just being intellectually dishonest and they are bashing the book (certainly some reviewers are more thoughtful and constructive than others) because they just don't agree or have an agenda and internal bias.  The whole books purpose partly was to point that out so it comes to no surprise that I am reading such divisive reviews.<br /><br />They don't get and and if they did, they wouldn't know how to react anyways.  People are so trained these days, can't really handle confront facts and truth that challenge their construct of the world we live in and how it works.<br /><br />Read the book or not, my vote is to read it.

(The tiny one percent with overwhelming wealth & power of spiraling concentrations of control via twisted NeoCon politics SUCKS, as it's treasonous, unpatriotic, apathetic, & racism.) Buy this book & read it to cut through the distortions made by selfish Republicans & their out-numbering lobbyists lies & deceptions. NeoCons just lie & lie & lie more & more with [politically engineered DISTORTION]. This book cuts through all those tricks & traps of NeoCons attempts at confusing the public.<br />BANKERS PLAYED LIAR'S POKER: THEE TRUE CAUSE OF THIS ECONOMIC DEPRESSION: Republicans aggressive anti-regulation & anti-tax demands caused underfunding, understaffing, & elimination of FEDERAL OVERSIGHT AGENCIES allowing uncontrolled tranching (slicing & dicing) of sub-prime toxic mortgages disguised as TRIPLE AAA PRIME using [credit default swaps & actuaries bogus derivatives] gambling by banks without proper collateral. REPUBLICANS NO REGULATIONS & NO TAXES DEMANDS caused uncontrolled hidden greedy chaos & gaming the system rampant FRAUD WITH A MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR DARK HIDDEN CASINO that imploded, all started by JP Morgan & Goldman Sachs young novice stupid actuaries. Novice actuaries were PROVEN WRONG in their risk formulations. NOBODY WAS WATCHING. NO ONE WAS REGULATING ALL THESE HIDDEN DARK MARKETS. NO MUSCLE OF ENFORCEMENT STILL TO THIS DAY.

0385523394|5.0|I really wanted a bit more post-script than what we get here, since the book ends abruptly when Piper is released after her year in prison. How did she fare after Danbury? She professes great love for her fellow cons, but did she ever go back for visits? Also, she writes that she never had sex in prison, despite her lesbian orientation in her youth after Smith College. That could be a lie to protect any partners still in jail, or her straight then-fiance who was waiting for her to get out. Either way, the details we do get are fascinating here about life at Danbury, Conn., womens' prison. If you have an interest in the topic, this will be a satisfying read. Not only did I live and work and imbibe at the brewery in the Massachusetts college town where Piper first got involved with her drug life, I probably ran across her then since it's a small town. Pure coincidence. Great reading.
0375703764|5.0|I am amazed at how many individuals gave this book a low rating because of the way it was written or the effort that was required to read it or because it was too \\"experimental.\\" Surely, you were aware of this before you even picked up this otherwise obscure title? Surely, had you wanted a no-nonsense, linear story, you could have purchased any one of the tens of thousands of books available on Amazon.com in just such a format?<br /><br />I, personally, enjoyed Danielewski's departure from conventional norms in print. In fact, I probably wouldn't have found the book as entertaining, otherwise. I assume that Danielewski intended the actual act of reading this book to engross the reader even deeper into the labyrinthine world of the house and of the protagonists of the book. And, certainly, many of the passages are even physically arranged like a labyrinth.<br /><br />That said, I do disagree with many of those who have called it a \\"horror\\" novel. While there are certainly elements of suspense, and even fantasy, it reads primarily like a drama, focusing on two individuals who are struggling with their own demons, some possibly real, possibly imagined. It is an intriguing tale with a lot of clever tangents, if you can keep yourself from getting too sidetracked by some of the deliberate minutiae.

081297381X|5.0|The Black Swan The Impact of the Highly Improbable<br />Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br /><br />A brief review<br /><br />Extreme events are more likely than we think - Taleb calls these \\"Black Swans\\" after the one-time European certainty, based on northern hemisphere experience, that all swans were white. Before we had an inkling of the global financial crises starting in 2007, Taleb, with almost impeccable timing, discusses the risks inherent in the big banks, and goes on to say, \\"Likewise the government sponsored institution Fanny Mae, when I look at their risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite,..\\". I should say, he wrote the book in 2006 and published in 2007.<br /><br />I, like many others, would ask, why isn't this required reading for those thinking of wanting a life in politics, economics and/or finance.<br /><br />The Black Swan challenges our desire and ability to acknowledge the impact of unknown, highly improbable events that can and will occur over our life-times looking at some of the features of human psychology that make us poor at evaluating uncertainties and risks, instead, amongst other things relying on narrative explanations and blinkered views.<br /><br />In \\"The Black Swan,\\" Taleb proclaims that the unexpected is the key to understanding not just financial markets but history itself. History, he writes, proceeds by \\"jumps,\\" controlled by \\"the tyranny of the singular, the accidental, the unseen and the unpredicted.<br /><br />Whilst the book contains numerous insights evidenced by examples such as: \\"We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control.\\" Like all things, there are shortcomings. The bulk of this book is underpinned by criticizing others for failing to see the future -- though who exactly can see the future? And on this Taleb generalizes, for instance scoffing that the collapse of the Soviet Union was an unfathomably unlikely event that \\"no social scientist saw coming.\\" The historian John Mueller's brilliant 1989 book, \\"Retreat From Doomsday,\\" published just before the Berlin Wall fell, did see it coming.<br /><br />The Black Swan is brilliant, thought-provoking and challenging in the most constructive and valuable ways.an John Mueller's brilliant 1989 book, \\"Retreat From Doomsday,\\" published just before the Berlin Wall fell, did see it coming.<br /><br />The Black Swan is brilliant, thought-provoking and challenging in the most constructive and valuable ways.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'm a fan of fiction which graphically depicts the dystopia we can fall into all too easily by trusting or surrendering to malevolent authority. The list is short of those writers who created enough authenticity to convince us their dystopia was or could be real - Orwell, Huxley, Butler, Wells, Rand, Heinlein, Bradbury, King, Atwood - and now Collins.<br /><br />In the Hunger games trilogy Collins has done a masterful job of weaving personal narratives and human conditions into the fabric of a post democratic American despotism - a dystopia where people are ruled by fear and absolute authoritarianism. The state shows its absolute power by making people submissively subject themselves to games where they are pitted against each other in life and death struggle for the amusement of the political class in the capital. These Roman like gladiatorial games utilize all the sinister little devices and technology that a high tech despotism can create. The slaughter is televised for the viewing \\"pleasure\\" of the slave classes - to both intimidate them and to give then a small sense of hope in their wretched servitude.<br /><br />The series of novels follows the perils, triumphs,loves and seemingly charmed existence of the protagonist \\"Katniss Everdeen\\" as she and her associates survive in the surreal despotism America has fallen into. Along her journey she gives others hope and inspiration to free themselves from the prison of fear in which the state controls its servile class.<br /><br />The novels are embracing and written in a protagonist narrative. The writing draws you into Katniss's world, you feel her fear and apprehension and the freedom in no longer being frightened of her tormentors. Collins has demonstrated a talent for not only being a master story teller but as being social visionary to have created this generation's Orwellian opus.<br /><br />Katniss's golden quote: \\"At some point, you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead. The hard thing is finding the courage to do it.\\"

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I found this movie engrossing.<br /><br />Alexander Payne once again tells a story of everyday life and in a just under two hours lets the viewer consider a variety of emotions from different character's perspectives.<br /><br />Clooney was an interesting choice as the very emotionally distant father to his two daughters. To be honest, I think he was too extreme and bordered on non-believable. Perhaps his lack of experience as a father was difficult for him to grasp the sincere empathy that the role required.<br /><br />Shailene Woodley was tremendous for a 21 year old with little movie experience. She was able to bring the pain, hurt, rage and sense of loss all to the screen. I hope we see more of her.<br /><br />Hawaii as the backdrop to the movie was inspired. It's tranquility and beauty in complete contrast to the emotional drama being played out in the foreground. I quite liked how one reviewer suggested Hawaii was in fact another character in the movie.<br /><br />So some excellent acting, a script and plot that allows the viewer to \\"participate\\" in the emotions played out on screen, made this a very thoughtful and strong drama.

B0016492BW|1.0|When I saw that this movie was available on Blu-ray, I ordered it almost immediately because it is one of my favorite movies and I love the Blu-ray format... so I pop the disc into my PS3 and it starts to play, then the screen goes completely blank and the lights on my PS3 are just blinking red and the system won't respond to any input... i try to eject the disc and nothing happens, so i basically had to take the whole system apart just to get the stupid disc out so now my PS3 is completely dead... then I try to play it on another blu-ray player that happened to be in my house and the screen just keeps saying \\"loading disc\\" and the front of the machine just keeps blinking lights and nothing is happening... I don't know if anyone else had a bad experience playing this disc like I did, but i am not happy.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|There are not words for me to describe how incredible this film is. Every family owes it to themselves to watch this movie. It is a moving and deeply profound look at family life, one that will change your heart forever!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This book and two following were all excellently written and entertaining.<br />I think Suzanne Collins could write on any subject and make it interesting. Her writing skills are well honed.<br />The thing I liked most about her themes was that I could not guess beforehand the way the plot was going forward.<br />The highest accolade is to have your book made into a movie - which has happened.<br />Standby for the next two movies based on the next two books in the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm sorry to say that I would only give this book a 3 star rating.  I was expecting much more after listening to so many good reviews, and people just voicing their opinions.  First, I had a really hard time with children killing each other for anything, but being manipulated made if ever worse.  I did read to the very end because even though I was uncomfortable with the story in general I had to give it a fair chance.  I do not plan on reading the next two and feel my time is too valuable, as well as there has to be much better books to read.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was having a lot of fun with this game. I reached level 50 and had over 100k coins; when I checked on the game today after work, with only a few hours since I last  played, my timers had all reset to 300 hours!!! I was planning to spend real money on gamecash but not now. Uninstalling. Very disappointed.

B003JYOEYM|2.0|Is this the worse movie I have rented through Amazon? No. Is it the worse movie George Romero has put out? No. Is it at all a good movie? No.....it was absolutely dreadful. If Romero hasnt \\"lost it\\", he has certainly \\"misplaced it\\"......this wasnt worth the small rental price I paid to see the thing. I wouldnt recommend this movie to my worst enemy.....well, maybe I would....but he would be the only one I would recommend it to.....absolutely dreadful!!
1451626657|5.0|One of the most hilarious books of all time. No other book has made me laugh out loud as often and authentically as maybe this except The Hitchhiker's Guide.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I will keep this brief. I discovered this album in the spring of 2008. It has been in my (constantly updated) playlist every day since. Regardless of what you think of BSB this is an incredible album. If you haven't heard it yet just buy it. It's only $7 bucks anyway. That's a trip to Wendy's. You'll be glad you did!
0062112430|5.0|For some reason, I've been hooked in YA books lately. I wasn't sure if this book would be for me when I read the premise. That's why it took so long for me to pick it up. I'm actually glad that I did because it had a very original concept and Lauren Oliver is a great story teller. I fell into her world head first and I don't know what hit me. Maybe it's love....<br /><br />In this book, love is considered a disease by the authorities and the government. A select few see past this \\"lie\\" and try to escape the procedures that are forced on the people to remove the possibility of getting infected by love. What I found interesting is the fact that most people actually buy into this \\"love is a disease\\" idea. Most city dwellers are happy to get the procedure done, and then paired off and forced to marry someone of the opposite sex.<br /><br />The author dabbled a bit with the idea of homosexual love, and how that's even scarier than heterosexual love. I think she made the right choice in mentioning it and on not elaborating it. The homosexual theme could be investigated a bit further in the series but there was enough information and conflict in this book to begin with.<br /><br />I will probably read the next book soon, since the author left us with a major cliffhanger. I heard that the cliffhanger for the second book is as bad as the first. I'll see for myself very soon! Great start to a great series. Young adults and adults are bound to \\"fall if love\\" with this story and its characters.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|One thing is for sure: There is no shortage of action in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. In fact, Tom Cruise and Director Brad Bird have created such an action packed spectacle with this movie that it made what was just over two hours of movie seem like like only an hour. Seriously...the action never slows down in MI Ghost Protocol that has Cruise and his gang out to stop some nut that wants to start a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution.<br /><br />While breaks in the action are few and far between, you do have to check reality at the door for this movie. Most of the stunts in MI Ghost Protocol are death defying and awesome to watch. But there were several where I was saying out loud \\"Yeah, right!\\" or \\"Oh, c'mon!\\" But all in a fun way. The entire movie is exactly that: Fun. Simon Pegg is back and adds his element of humor. The rest of Cruise's team is balanced out with Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton, and the group gels well together and have great chemistry on the screen.<br /><br />And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some of the gadgets: bionic contact lenses, gloves that stick to any surface, and a BMW with a touchscreen interface integrated into the windshield. Man, it was worth the price of admission just to see those three things in action.<br /><br />MI Ghost Protocol is a visually stunning dish of a movie with a nice side of good story writing. Get this one to the top of your list.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent book (actually series of books). It is a very suspenseful book once you get going and it broaches big ideas. I would say if you like sci-fi, suspense/thriller, or books with deep thoughts this is a good book for you.
B006QKJZMW|3.0|I am a tried and true horror fan from waay back. I adored Hostel 1 & 2 but this..Hmmm..It was not a suck fest, but it lacked that special something that made it's predecessors truly kick ass. They snuck into your brain and scared you to the core. Made you gasp. They were not cheez-oid slasher fliks but very real and very raw and very possible!<br />I say don't dismiss but don't expect the same intensity and rawness of the other 2.
B000002GB6|5.0|My husband has always love the instrumental \\"Feels So Good\\".  I think he has listened to it over and over since we got the CD.  He even has it as a ringtone!  The rest of the CD is pretty good too!!
0345803507|3.0|The entire series is a perfectly good fluff piece. This one was my favorite of the three, so I'll just review this one.<br /><br />Yes, I know that it was fanfiction first, which it does read like. The way the first book ends is exactly the way a fanfiction writer ends a story they're about to have a sequel to.  The first book especially is laden with bizarre consistency errors (7 hour of sleep goes to 8, or particularly bad is a scene where Ana starts out wearing a mint skirt, and ends wearing jeans).  Also, it's not very well written, though the author herself acknowledges this and can't seem to believe that people like it so much.<br /><br />Yes, I know it's based of Twilight, but while certain character dynamics are the same, it's really not very like Twilight... at all. I actually preferred this series to Twilight (and no, it's not all the kinky, kinky sex. Smut bores me terribly, and I ended up skimming just about every scene where they have sex.) What I liked better about this series is that I actually like the main couple. I never hated any of Twilight's characters, but Bella was not someone I liked, and I never liked Edward at all. In contrast I actually like Ana and Christian. Ana is actually not useless, and when the time comes she is very capable and resourceful (though I wish it had shown up before the third book instead of just being talked about).<br /><br />No, Ana is not a strong heroine, and no, Christian is not an ideal boyfriend and their relationship is weird and shouldn't work, but somehow it does. No, do not take this for real life... but then who actually think that real life is supposed to be like this? There's no reason to call this a blow to feminism. It's a book, it's fluff, it's fun.<br /><br />Why did I like this book the most? Because at some point there's an actual threat. The first book was the getting to know each other book. Book two seemed to drag on... a lot. I kept wondering why nothing was happening... or why the main action ofthe book seemed to be wrapped up half way through. This one seemed to have the same problem as book two, until I got to the end and some action really did happen and I ended up ignoring the rest of the world for about an hour and a half so I could finish it all. Also, this book has the part at the end from Christian's perspective, which I found really cute and interesting.<br /><br />Now, a bit on the characters. In one of the reviews someone complained that college students don't think the way Ana does, that her thinking is very adolescent, like a high school girl. As a college student about Ana's age I can say that her thinking is really pretty normal. Most college students see themselves more as kids than as adults, even being able to drink and drive and vote (though not all at the same time, we should hope). Bella Swan felt like a teenage girl, with all the whining and teen angst. Yes, this has whining and angst, but the character is self aware enough to reflect on her own actions and things she does.<br /><br />She's not my favorite character ever, but as an avatar she does quiet well and as a character she stands on her own fine. Christian Grey is an appealing man. Women like a project. He's also messed up enough that you can see that Ana is also messed up. There's a moment in the second book when Dr. Flynn points out that her self esteem is almost as bad as Christian's is. With Bella Swan, her comments on her looks never made me question that she was plain, which made me question why Edward even cared except that she smelled nice. Ana is shown to be a bit romantic, a bit spacey, and most of all and English major, someone so wrapped up in her own world that she hardly notices the outside. I believe that she doesn't realize that she's being flirted with, because it's just a function of that particular mindset (speaking from experience, and knowing from other English majors).<br /><br />The question is, is the story any good? It's not great, and it's not Twilight. There's not as much action, but I cared more about the characters than I did with Twilight. I did want to see what would happen to them. One of my favorite things about the story is just seeing the intimacy. Normally stories with romances end once the couple gets together, but the couple sustains three books by being together the whole time, just learning about each other. Things are a bit repetitive, but then people like to use the same jokes over and over, and they need the same reassurances. Someone telling you that you're beautiful once will never cut it, and for two people who think badly of themselves positive reassurance is pretty necessary.<br /><br />On the whole I can see why people love these books: they're fun. They're not great story telling, but they're enjoyable and relaxing and just gripping enough to be interesting without forcing the reader to abandon their lives to finish the series. Not good, not bad, but definitely fun.

As long as they dont kill off a main character!<br />Oops..Bobbie and Cass who?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. It is easy to learn and enjoyable to play if you like little puzzles. The levels are easier than I expected, and receiving a perfect score on all levels seems a little too easy.  The execution and presentation make it a great game, only a little short on replay value.
145162445X|5.0|As much as I appreciate science, I would not consider myself very well educated in the field. This book, as well as the lecture he gives on the same topic, succeeded in teaching me some of the concepts that I previously struggled with. If you aren't a scientist, like me, he might lose you in a few spots but he does a WONDERFUL job of bringing it all together and helping you comprehend some of the more complex concepts. This book showed me how far science has really come, and also how far it has to go. Christians who want to remain uneducated about science will negatively review this book, but if you're open to learning, you will love it.

0142410705|4.0|Colin Singleton is a washed up child prodigy who never quite achieved genuis status. Despite his impressive anagramming abilities, his sexy jew-fro, and winning $10,000 on a gameshow called KranialKidz, he is in a serious slump. He has just been dumped by K-19 (the 19th girl he has dated named Katherine), and he can't seem to find the missing peice of him she took with her.<br /><br />Luckily for Colin, he has an underachieving best friend, Hassan, who is determined to prevent Colin from wallowing in self-pity. Hassan and Colin leave Chicago and embark on road trip that takes them exactly where they need to be. Green shows us that contrary to popular belief, sometimes it's not the journey that matters, but the destination. Set on proving a theorem on relationship predictability, Colin researches his past, analyzes the present, and attempts to predict his future using his mathematical abilities.<br /><br />I have had this book for quite sometime but had put off reading it for several reasons. Mainly because I despise math, and between the math and the anagramming, I thought this book would be a nightmare. However, by page 11, I myself had a crush on Colin (and the anagramming is ironically entertaining). Green shows that even child prodigies can be unpretentious and lovably clueless. The randomness of Hassan and Colin's interations accurately depict young adult male friendships. Hassan provides comic relief (we're talking laugh out loud funny) and a necessary balance to Colin's serious demeanor.<br /><br />Several quotable passages make this a thought-provoking read as well as an entertaining one.<br /><br />\\"You can love someone so much, he thought. But you can never love someone as<br />much as you can miss them.\\" (p.105)<br />\\"Books are the ultimate dumpees: put them down and they'll wait for you forever;<br />pay attention to them and they'll always love you back.\\" (p.110)<br />Due to the abundance of four-letter-words and plenty of sexual references, I probably couldn't get this book into my classroom even if I begged, but I would definitely recommend it to friends. Green is a seriously talented writer with an amazing ability to capture audiences of all ages and both sexes. Colin is one of the most unique protagonists I have ever come across. Picture Adam Brody in the movie version, but quirkier and less confident.couldn't get this book into my classroom even if I begged, but I would definitely recommend it to friends.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Just like any other skill game, it starts out simple enough, and gets more complicated as is goes on.  Except this one lulled me into a sense of complacency before pulling out the stops and actually making me think for a change.  Nice.<br /><br />It's almost a too-simple idea for a game, but it works and will get you hooked if you play it long enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|loved it.  I couldnt put it down.  Can't wait to get to the next one!!!!!!  It felt as though I was in the arena with Katniss and just wanting to help guide her.  Great read.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|that some reviewers in the press would have us believe.<br /><br />I was expecting the worst, but this film is actually ok! Very similar to Oceans 11 (especially in some sequences and sound-track areas, deliberately of course), this film isn't a laugh a minute \\"Airplane\\" type spoof, but a fastish paced heist movie, set in  tower. It doesnt get too silly and some time is spent fleshing out the characters a little, and all in all, you could do far worse than get this out on a saturday night, or download it or whatever the kids do these days, internet in ireland is generally crap, in fact, in many places, it is actually easier, and cheaper to hire a set of actors to come around to your house and perform the film for you, rather than rely on streaming...for added realism, one of the actors will spin a plate with \\"buffering\\" on it every few seconds whilst everyone else stands still... ho hum,

0439023513|3.0|After reading the whole Hunger games triology I find this one to be the weakest. Its not bad but has a far different pacing then the other 2 books which sours it. Hunger games and Catching fire were books based primarily on survial. Mocking Jay is more a Behind the scenes of war and torture. Personally I think the book would have been better if Katniss and co. had been taken by the capitol then had to make there own escape however this \\"war story\\" is an orange in a package of apples.<br /><br />Also when the captiol invasion comes I find it to be frank a little cartoony and silly which is sad considered the dark and grim setting privious. Its not that people are that way but the foes that they face.
0765316994|5.0|As I read John Scalizi's book Redshirts I repeatedly found myself thinking about the movie `The Cabin in the Woods'. Both are very meta and recursive and both are loads of fun.  If you've ever seen any episode of a science fiction television show and cringed but loved it any way, then I think you will enjoy reading Redshirts.<br /><br />Even though I knew that the main gist of this story was `death by away team' the plot still followed a path that I was not quite expecting so I do not want to give away too many details.<br /><br />I am a quasi-sci-fi-fan. My favorite television show is Doctor Who. I watch Fringe. I loved Firefly. I know my Star Wars and Star Trek just enough. But I've never been to comic-con. I am not a card carrying geek nerd is my point. I just dabble from time to time. I have explained my credentials because I think that's important for recommending a book like this. I loved the book and laughed a lot. It was great fun. I'm not sure how a real science fiction fan would take to the light tone of the book.<br /><br />The story is very creative. I really did laugh out loud quite a bit. I even got a little misty eyed at one point.  This business of a novel with three codas goes over my head. I am all for the idea of three different endings but all three of these endings were lame compared to the ending the reader first comes to. Other than that feature I enjoyed the rest of the book very much.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It's amazing how the same game can feel fresh just by updating the graphics/theme, but it works.  Gameplay is better in ad-free versions but this is as good a Angry Birds game as any.  I especially like the different musical takes on the regular Angry Bird theme that come with each season's layout.  So far I think my favorite is the Chinese New Year.
B006PZBR8S|3.0|Really don't have any idea what the point of this movie was, has all the thought of a WWE wrestling match [but not as cerebral, lol]<br />Kind of like the opposite of Stallone's 'Over The Top', in OTT Stallone is fighting for his son, in this movie Jackmans' totally forgettable character Charlie is not fighting for anything - nor do we have any compelling reason to want him to after his character is revealed to be a person who seems not to give a crap about anything but money. There was an attempt to redeem him but way too late in the movie and far too little content to that redemption... there's no real emotional climax for the father it seems.<br /><br />All story criticisms aside, there are some genuine worthwhile points in this film, the interactions between the kid and his robot are solid \\"boy and his dog\\" tropes, with the added layer of the robot serving as a surrogate father figure for the son. My kids loved it - but all agreed the dad was worthless. Even at the end, the best we get from him is pretty lacking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this trilogy after reading the first book, I ordered the second and third in the series.  I couldn't put them down.  I went to see the movie and was very glad that I had read the book even though I loved the movie. You can't beat having a Kindle especially when you finish a book late at night and want the next one right away. do your self a favor, block off some time and read these books you will love them.
0446572993|5.0|Most books I read today are rather formulaic and I can usually anticipate the ending in the first third or so in the book. This book was a pleasant surprise. Not only did it keep my interest, but it kept me guessing and popped up interesting twists throughout. Baldacci has always been a good writer, this is one of his better ones.

I found the book to be beautifully written and it not only helped me to learn the Tarot (because the learning system within it works very well) but also to access a part of me I didn't even know existed. The cards that accompany the book are absolutely beautiful and add to a deeper learning experience I didn't think possible. I really loved it. I highly recomend it to anyone wanting to learn about Tarot or even a deeper meaning of one's self.

What I got was an app that doesn't print the entire page, but rather cuts off the last few lines on a page or the last section or paragraph of the page.

B00402FGE4|4.0|Look, I'll be honest.  I think the original [[ASIN:B000JCSPG0 Stargate]] was a great sci-fi movie.  But the side series just never caught on with me.  People went through the gate, had an adventure, then returned, ad infinitum.  I'm surprised I even gave SGU: Stargate Universe a try.<br /><br />But I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The unique nature of this Stargate story is that a bunch of people, ill sorted and ill prepared, have to go through a Stargate to survive.  And they find themselves on an ancient ship located... on the other side of the universe?  No [[ASIN:B00062IDDS Star Trek Voyager]] here, stuck 70 some years from Earth.  These passengers will have to get the shipboard Stargate powered and dialed for Earth.  And the eclectic nature of the part civilian, part military crew gives the screenwriters a great deal of material to work with.<br /><br />Interesting stuff!

1451673442|5.0|I love this book!  Have The Secret DVD and CD and they are also great products by Rhonda Byrne.  Anyone who reads this book and doesn't achieve their dreams isn't practicing it on a day to day basis.  It will change your life if you let it.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Actually I would recomend this Home Alone and the first Home Alone movie because both are just as funny. And actually they didnt do it twice because while they left him behind in the first movie in this one he had his own ticket and got on the wrong plane. For that reason alone I disagree with anyone who says if youve seen one youve seen them both. Yes they have similar plotlines. I dont want to get negative or preachy but has it occured to anyone that it stops there? Anyway give Home Alone and Home Alone 2 a try. The third and forth are where they went downhill. Merry Christmas.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but I have to in this case.  Elite Pro's has to be one of the best companies with an outstanding customer service department.  I have been dealing with them on a purchase issue and they are doing everything in thier power to make the issue right with me.  I am very satisfied with how they conduct their business and am very pleased with their customer service.  I would recommend them to anyone anytime!<br />Edgar

0802798225|5.0|Originally Reviewed at:Mother/Gamer/Writer<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 Controllers<br />Review Source: Purchased<br />Reviewer:Jennifer<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles is a new and interesting take on the phrase; opposites attract. This is the tale of two seemingly different teenagers from two very different worlds on the north and south sides of suburban Chicago. This tale narrated by its two main characters, Alejandro Fuentes and Brittany Ellis.<br /><br />Brittany Ellis is a typical high school student living in the wealthy north side of suburban Chicago. To her friends and other school mates, she has the perfect life, perfect family, perfect car, and perfect boyfriend, but this is a myth that she encourages to disguise the truth. At home, if Brittany doesn't do exactly as her mother wishes, she has the deal with her mother's intense attitude and often yelling. Her father offers no relief as he is always gone with his job at a computer company. On the few occasions' that he is home, he does not interact with the family choosing to lock himself away in his office and continue his work. Brittany's only relief comes from caring for her elder sister Shelly. Shelly, who has cerebral palsy, cannot function very well on her own and must be taken care of 24/7. Spending time with Shelly is the Brittany's only real relief from the stress of her chaotic life. The chaos only worsens when she catches the eye of well known Latin Blood member Alejandro Fuentes.<br /><br />Alejandro Fuentes is an eighteen year old high school student living with his mother and two younger brothers on the south side of the same city. Because his father was murdered when Alex was very young, responsibility has fallen on his shoulders to be the man of the house. This includes joining the Latin Bloods in order to keep his family safe. This also means making sure that his younger brothers, fifteen year old Carlos and eleven year old Luis, away from the same lifestyle. Though Alex does achieve high grades and has dreams of going to college and having a better life, he feels that he will never achieve those dreams. Therefore, he intends to see that his brother can have the life that he can't. Much like the locations, his life is the exact opposite of Brittany's. At least that's what they believe.<br /><br />Brittany and Alex's paths first cross on the first day of their senior year at Fairfield High School when Brittany nearly hits Alex when attempting to pull into the same parking space. Their paths cross again when the two are paired together in their chemistry class leading them into a relationship neither can understand nor stop.<br /><br />Simone Elkeles does a phenomenal job capturing the reality of teenage relationships and situations. She keeps the book interesting by putting the reality of teenage life into a romance novel for young adults. She also tells of the realities of gang life and how seemingly perfect lives aren't always what they seem. If you're looking for a steamy teen romance about the good girl and the bad boy, who always turns out to be better than you think, Perfect Chemistry is the book you want to read.eve high grades and has dreams of going to college and having a better life, he feels that he will never achieve those dreams.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|First of all, just go to 4shared and download the full version for free. That is if you want it. It takes up a bunch of space and it's not even that good. I don't hate it, but it's not that great.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|time consuming, but very fun. So much so I'm running two apps on different devices. also like bakery story and fashion story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great.  I love it and miss playing the old scoop Oregon trail game. I give it five stars.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show just gets better and better and better. I got this for my mom but watched it with her. I am current on all seasons and I just can't believe how funny and clever the show is. I can't get enough. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stop now.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful Trilogy and looking forward to more from the author. Love my Kindle. It is the best. I am a Digital Convert!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lots of fun. good controls. good graphics. you will have a lot of fun playing it. worth getting. flashbacks to Mario brothers.
0738711500|5.0|I bought this set from a bookstore, locally. I absolutely love how beautiful and well-designed the card deck is. The book also is very explanatory and makes learning how to do spreads and read the cards easy. I would highly suggest this set to anyone who is looking into learning how to read tarot with little to no previous knowledge beforehand.
1468179993|5.0|This should be required reading for anyone preparing to speak at TED or TEDx.  The chapters are really concise and insightful, all you need to know and nothing you don't need.  I read it before my TEDx talk and the suggestions given by Jeremey made the whole preparation process much easier for me, from the research, to the writing, to the rehearsal.<br /><br />One of the most useful elements is how Jeremey breaks down actual TED talks and explains what made them effective.  You can then refer to the videos on TED.com and see it in action.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone giving a TED talk or any presentation in general.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I wanted to show my son this game but I think it is horrible to wait so long. funny thing is that it should take 10 minutes for some things to finish but now it tells me 175 hours.... that's like a week
B0071QIN00|3.0|ive played this on my friends kindles and love it but I cant download it on my own kindle can someone help me thx
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The Oregon Trail: American Settlers is a game where you have to make a settlement in Oregon.  I think this game is just a good game because of the supplies problems.  When you first start the game, food and lumber are easy to get.  But later in the game, food becomes a concern.  This is a good game and I would recommend this to people who like history.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games (1st Volume)  & love it.  Wii be buying other Two.  I read them on my Kindle.
0345803485|4.0|Easy read. Loved it. On the third book. EL James really captivates the reader. I can totally relate to Ana.
B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|I found Inkeepers to be painfully slow. I won't bore with details about the story of the movie since by now you've probably read the synapses and if not there are many other reviews that contain these details. In my opinion there is such a thing as too slow. I usually am drawn to slow burn movies, where the creepiness builds to full impact. I sat through paranormal activity, the others, orphanage, and most will say those movies seem slow. This one didn't really seem to move at all for a very long time. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Most of the time when something did happen, it turned out to be mostly the types of things that one spooks them selves with, like hearing a noise in the other room, but finding no real evidence or source, leaving you wondering, is it just Claire imagining things or is something really going on. It seemed the male lead just kept going off to bed, like a lot, and Claire was left to deal with the ghost hunting stuff which was mostly her walking around with a long microphone and recording device. I found Sara Paxton overly quirky, like she was trying too hard to fit into this boring role, and it left me wondering why she took the part. She definitely doesn't look like her usual self in this movie, having little to no make up, a bad haircut and tomboy clothes. I found some scenes just felt like filler and had no reason for being in the movie, like an interaction with a talkative diner waitress that leads absolutely no where and does nothing to move the plot forward. The movie did have a few interesting moments, but they mostly came at the very end. Generally I was left feeling underwhelmed. I found little comparison to House of the Devil by the same director, that movie was slow, but stuff was still happening in it at least. I was actually really disappointed in Inkeepers after all the hype, and really wish I had rented first. Too much expectation after House of the Devil I guess. Win some, lose some, but there's no pointif you can't get to the end. A real snooze!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like most of the games. gives you variety and you also don't have to download a bunch of games to cure boredom
B007BRJYF2|5.0|Worth the buck.  Finished it in two days playing if off and on. Very addictive.  Live the graphics.  Recommend for all ages.  Great worn my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I accidentally found this music on Youtube and was so impressed that I immediately had to download it. The downloading process what quick and fairly painless, and the music is absolutely superb! If anyone likes the scores from Harry Potter, The Island or from movie trailers, you'll definitely like this. A smooth mix of orchestra, techno, and new age with a very wide range from happy and light to much darker. It's been very inspiring!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|WOW! Its a twist on the good old Angry Birds. It is a lots of fun trying to find the right shot to launch the bird and get the pigs. Its cool how they just hang around in space. Nice time killer!
1423136802|5.0|I bought the Percy Jackson series for my daughter's birthday, but the books were so enjoyable, I ended up reading them before she did.  They are very creative and are very descriptive so you can form pictures in your mind about what is going on.  I also want to get the next series by this author.  Very enjoyable reads.
B004JHY8A8|4.0|This story was moving, tragic & compelling. It tells parts of the  Jewish holocaust experience from the French perspective through the eyes of an American. It tells a heart wrenching story of how thousands of French Jews were herded into the Vel de Hiv before being sent to the camps using one families' experience. Through the Americans' research you get to see what happens to the girl \\"Sarah\\" and her family during and after the war and into the modern day. The secrecy, guilt and tragedy of the Holocaust for many survivors is paramount especially to Sarah's future. A must for anyone interested in our not too distant history. Tugs at the heart strings..
1932100660|5.0|Once I started reading this book I could not put it down.  I felt like I was in a college course and learning so much.  I have been a vegetarian for over twenty years but this book kicked it up a notch higher.  I kept reading parts of it to my husband who became interested in it and also read it.  He has been a real meat eater all of our 43 years of marriage and immediately after reading the book he turned vegan as did I.  We go forward with good health and he has lost seven pounds in a little over two weeks.  We eat wonderful vegan meals that I prepare at home and enjoy doing so.  We have since given this book to many of our family and friends.  I wish it had been published thirty years ago when I was raising our family.  Thank you Colin Campbell for all your research and this amazing book!
B0037RDPEG|5.0|I loved \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" I can't believe so many people I have spoken to didn't like it - It was easy to read, emotional, romantic and yet therapeutic. I would love to be able to travel like she did but i dont hold that against Elizabeth. She went through rough times and found ways to deal with it - yes its a little \\"out there\\" for the average mum to achieve - but I loved the ideals behind it. It was a great book - I really liked enjoyed one & the movie as well. I'd read it again.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|GREAT,GREAT,GREAT, CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 5. SOA ROCKS!! I WOULD ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF  GETTING PATCHED IN WITH THE SONS.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|it was a wonderful book. very exiting. only problem is that it ended with at least ten cliff hangers. MUST MAKE SECOND BOOK!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I think that this is a great game!!! If this game was maybe a little more different from red remover in a unique way it would be complete.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This movie is great for anyone who needs a little inspiration. Bethany Hamilton's story is so powerful, and the movie does a great job of telling it!! Definitely worth the money.

0071636080|5.0|Disclaimer: I am an Apple lover and a big fan of Steve Jobs, very grateful and appreciative of products that I have found to be transformative.  I greatly respect his dedication to the passionate pursuit of excellence.<br /><br />I have always admired the oratorical skills of Steve Jobs, particularly the brilliant Apple keynote speeches and his iconic commencement address at Stanford.  I do<br />my fair share of public speaking and aspire to have the smooth style, brevity and enthusiasm that are intrinsic to the grand master.  Carmine Gallo does an inspiring job in deconstructing the key elements of the Jobs' oratorical techniques so as to understand how to deliver a phenomenal presentation.  This book was an easy and interesting read and I found it to be of great utility and immediately integrated the tenets and secrets of Steve Job's rhetorical skills and passionate style into my own public addresses, whether the audience be one person or an auditorium-full of people.  In the following words, I will summarize the salient points made by Carmine Gallo.<br /><br />Regarding the use of data during a presentation, make it specific, relevant, and contextual. Speak in simple, clear, and direct language.  Unclutter and eliminate redundant language, buzzwords, and jargon. Edit, edit, and edit some more.  Gallo references Kawasaki's qualities of an outstanding demonstration: simple, short, sweet, swift and substantial.<br /><br />Make an effort to stroke the dopamine receptors of your audience. After all, your customers are your sales force and the most potent evangelists for your cause.<br />Dopamine greatly aids memory and information processing and if you can get the brain to put a chemical \\"post-it\\" note on an idea, it will be more robustly processed and easily remembered.  Powerful terms, when integrated them into your talks, will help release the dopamine, as will an emotionally charged delivery. SJ loved the following zippy words: amazing; incredible; gorgeous; insanely great; coolest; buckle up; put on your shoulder harness; lust object; stunning; miraculously engineered.<br /><br />Presentation skills are fundamental.  It is important to maintain good eye contact and positive body language: an open body without fidgeting or other distracting habits without looking back at slides or hiding behind the lectern. The delivery should vary the vocal volume, inflection, and cadence.  Filler words should be avoided and pauses should be used in their place.  Unleash your inner Zen by using very few words and plenty of compelling visuals.  An energetic delivery is quintessential--passion in the voice, a bounce in the step, and a smile on the face are inspirational.  Enthusiasm makes one likable.  Share your passion for your, subject and your enthusiasm will be contagious.<br />One's speaking style should be informal and casual. Never read slides or turn your back to the audience.  Slides should be highly visual with one key idea only.  Memorize the one key idea per slide. Practice the entire presentation without notes simply using slides as prompter. Spontaneity is the result of planned practice!<br /><br />Steve Jobs consistently adheres to the rule of three:  the human mind can only consume three points of information in short-term memory. Our brains crave meaning before detail, so deliver the big picture before filling in the details. If you can't describe your product or service in 140 characters or less, go back to the drawing board. Every great book or movie has a hero and a villain. Consider a presentation in the same way--a theatrical event complete with a protagonist and antagonist.  Jobs uses the rhetorical device of raising a question and providing the answer. Your audience is asking what's in it for me?  Don't leave them guessing. The villain can be a competitor or in many cases a problem in need of a solution.<br />Most presenters have more information than they can easily convey in a short amount of time. Don't try to squeeze in everything. Simplify communications. If you want to deliver a Jobs-worthy presentation, avoid content overload.  The 10-minute rule simply states that your audience will lose attention after 10 minutes.  At the 10-minute mark introduce a break in the action: a video, stories, another speaker, and a demo all can be effective. A prop is anything to take the attention away from the presentation and gives the audience a break from the slides. They appreciate the diversion.<br /><br />In summary, Carmine Gallo's book is a winner and will prove to be of great help in improving the communication skills of anybody doing a presentation. I only wish that the presenters at many of the medical lectures that I have attended had read this book!<br /><br />Andrew Siegel, M.D.<br />AUTHOR OF: PROMISCUOUS EATING--UNDERSTANDING AND ENDING OUR SELF-DESTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH FOODeze in everything.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I actually prefer this version to the first one...seems easier?!  Love a game that makes me think without pressure of time limits.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I was hoping that I wouldn't be one of the people that couldn't download it to my Kindle Fire but sadly I was.  Many attempts were made to download, including uninstalls, etc. but to no avail.  I quite enjoyed Snark Busters and was looking forward to this game but that's not going to happen....
B00006FI51|1.0|Useless. Can't play it! Wrong region encoding!  Warning!  A complete waste of money!  Warning! I am being clear? I don't suggest buying this DVD.  Honey, they shrunk my wallet!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is super long and sometimes a challenge but besides that this game is amazing!!!!!!!! i cant thonk of 1  bad thing about this game...get it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a pass the time game for young and older alike.  It helps one appricate forces and angles in order to complete each level.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|Having been a huge fan of The Edge, I was really mostly interested in only his part of the film. But I have to say, I never really got into much of Jack White's music. But after watching this, I truly appreciate his musical talent and his raw ingenuity. I also now have a whole new appreciation for Led Zeppelin. I mean, Jimmy Page blew my mind! I have Led Zeppelin's box set, but now knowing how Jimmy and the rest of the band created their music was really inspiring.<br /><br />The film is pretty fitting considering the 3 differences in generation gap between the guitarists and history. It's like the film has something for anyone who's into rock and roll.<br /><br />I would like to see a sequel with some other guitarist like, BB King, Clapton, and Slash. (There are some many greats!)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like this game alot.  It takes a fair amount of time to get from one level to the next but not so much that you get bored.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun you play mini games to unlock more mini games the mini games are fun and hard
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|Filmmaker Ti West pulls a page out of old Hollywood using an old hotel as the backdrop for a supernatural mystery. In the sense of \\"Paranormal Activity\\", West relies on sound and cinematography to enter the audiences imagination and saves the makeup for the last 20-30 minutes out of a 110 minute film. The idea is cool, the dialogue bounces off well, the atmosphere is creepy, and the minimum cast make it believeable, but the script is filled with one major plot hole: what the crap happened?! The two main characters are so determined to solve the mystery behind a woman's death, though it's never explained nor explored leaving the audience scratching their heads and with a disappointing ending. I liked it, but would've enjoyed it more if it stuck to the concept it was trying to build instead of building around it.
0345803485|1.0|I was very dissapointed in this novel since it seemed to be a HOT topic.  There are some good sex scenes but the story is very lacking in any real substance.  I was half way into the book when I realized that the story was the sex and email traffic between the two.  I have the second book but probably will pass as I need more then just references to genitilia to keep me reading.  If you look at the reviews,  there are quite a number of 1 stars.  Are some people giving this 5 stars just porn addicts or afraid to say they found reading about this particular story based on sex boring?  Even a porn addict would need the some visual, though.  Oh, well if you wasnt an interesting story with suspense, drama, comedy, etc, skip this series.  If you just want to read about domination and sex then it may work for you.
B0034G4P1W|3.0|\\"The Pirates! Band of Misfits\\" is the latest from Aardman Animations, the studio who brought to life \\"Chicken Run\\" and the fantastic Wallace and Gromit. In this adventure, Aardman Animations tackles the high seas focusing on The Pirate Captain and his dream of winning the Pirate of the Year award. Who holds the most booty receives the reward. The Pirate Captain and his crew set off attacking ship after ship in search of gold. But when the Pirate Captain meets scientist Charles Darwin, the two have a misunderstanding about unlimited wealth causing the Pirate Captain to choose between riches and re-discovering the true meaning why people become pirates. Based off Gideon Defoe's novels, the adaptation is an 88 minute decent 3/5 stars. If it weren't for a few plot holes and a few boring moments where I wanted the characters to \\"get on with it!\\", it might've lived up to it's overhyped trailer. It's not one of those \\"once you've viewed the trailer, you've seen it all\\" but it's CLOSE! I don't recommend theatre admission unless your children really, really want to see it. Fans of the studio (particularly who love Wallace and Gromit) will be disappointed.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is AWESOME!!!<br /><br />I went from season 1 to season 2 in one day. I just had to keep on watching to find out what's next? Who is going to die next? Where they going to go next?<br /><br />I couldn't stop watching for longer than a hour. After finishing season 2 I was sad that I had to wait till October before season 3 starts. But knew I had to wait even longer before the whole season 3 finish before I start watching it. I hate watching week by week, so I won't do that and am very sad that I have to force myself to stay away from this series like this. But, I know it's for the better because it's torture for me to watch weekly.<br /><br />Season 2 picks right up from season 1. Rick is trying to find the group of people to a safe place to stay. They end up at the CDC building and think they are safe there, when the doors are lock shut and no zombies can ever break in. They manage to get in, but later they find out they have to leave again for a different reason than zombies. Yet another character will die at this location but I won't say who.<br /><br />Rick and the group now are back on the road and trying to find another location to stay safe at. They end up at this farm and they will be there until the end of this season. They are fairly safe at this location. But, what they are really doing is trying to locate a missing party member when they get to the farm. That is why they stay at the farm for so long.<br /><br />When the group eventually leaves the farm, few people in the main party will die, but they will pick up new party member in the group going into season 3.<br /><br />I really can't wait for this awesome series to start up and end, so that I can watch it all in one shot later on. :)<br /><br />I highly recommend this series if you love zombies!
B005FUTBWS|4.0|Kevin Smith's most recent and last film \\"Red State\\" features a kick ass performance from John Goodman. It was a change of pace for Smith. It's preachy, it's thought-provoking, and it's controversial. The film made me wonder what else he's capable of. With this piece, I think he's throwing in the towel way too soon because I feel there's a lot more left unexplored inside the mind of a filmmaker who brought us \\"Clerks\\", \\"Dogma\\", and \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\".
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The only reason why I'm giving this series 4 stars and not 5 is because I kind of felt it was too short. There's only 6 shows and it's really quick compared to season 2.<br /><br />Yes, I know this is the same old Hero leads a bunch of people out of this Zombie hell of the world story again, but the formula works. I love it! In this show, the formula kind of changes. You get to know the characters more and more, but they will end up died. The zombies will eventually find and kill a character you grown to like/love, and you don't know who is next to die!<br /><br />You might think that in all zombies shows, you know a bunch of people and they will die eventually, but it's different with this show. You don't usually get to know those people that MUCH! You really get the feeling that anyone could get caught by a zombie and get infected and just turn into one at anytime, anywhere.<br /><br />In the story Rick is pretty much the only 1 person, you know for sure, he will not get turned it a zombie. The only reason for that is because he is the MAIN CHARACTER! No, not just a main character, THE MAIN CHARACTER. A main character can still be likely get turned or die in this series.<br /><br />The story follows Rick and what he is doing most of the time. The show also shows other people like Rick wife, son, and best friend and what they are doing. Rick is trying to find his wife and son, but unkonwn to him is where they are. He believes that they are safe and unharmed, but doesn't know where they are. He gets pieces of info from people he meets to where his family might be.<br /><br />The people in this story continue to find themselves never ever being save. Even if they think they are \\"safe\\", they eventually are not safe and have to keep on moving and finding somewhere safe.<br /><br />I did not wait to watch season 2 after finishing season 1. Season 1 was awesome and I knew I had to keep on watching to the next season 2. Hint: Season 2 is even better than 1!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Yes, the book was very wordy.  However, if you stuck with it and I did, it was worth the read.  It is one of those books I can say proudly that I read.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I have to say, as a novice indie, I found David's eBook superb. David shares his obvious wealth of knowledge in a clear, concise and well organised manner. His book takes the reader through all aspects of eBook self publishing and at the same time provides great encouragement for aspiring indies. I would consider David's book a must have for anyone considering the new media indie route. Once read the book then becomes a reference source which users can easily dip back into as needs arise.
0345803485|1.0|This book is nothing but TRASH !!!!! Do NOT waste your money !!!!! I can not believe they would publish such rubbish !!!!  How it got on a best selling list is beyond me. Don't waste your time or money !!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I would like it.  It's written in the first person and I normally do not like books written like that.  As I read I found that I had to keep reading.  You all know what I mean.  It's about a 21 year old girl and a very, very rich man.  He is not that much older than she is, but on the surface, is so much more experienced than she is.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the girl has more smarts tham I gave her credit for.  Kudos to Ana for what she did in the end.  Spoiler Alert.  It doesn't end the way you would think a romance should.  I find that I have to get the other two books just see what happens.  I do feel that, based on what I've read about the 2nd and 3rd book, that it probably could have been all one book.  We will see.  I read some of the reviews that were not very complimentary and find that some of them missed the point.  That's my take on it anyway.

B003NHRIVQ|4.0|My daughter and I are suckers for a love story.  This movie provides several levels: the realistic love of bad girl Ronnie and rich, but troubled Will, the love/hate relationship of Ronnie and her Dad, even the love of her brother, and mother.  We enjoy the supporting cast including brother Jonah, and father Steve (played by Bobby Coleman and Greg Kinnear).  The only parts that don't fly are the beach volleyball.  Who would even care?  Our three favorite scenes?  When she plays the piano for Will, when she appears at the wedding in her fun but believable gown, and when the turtles hatch.  Is it the best movie ever?  No, it's a warm cup of cocoa on a wintry night, or a cozy blanket when you're wanting a little cuddle time with your favorite girl.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love RPG games in general and this one is awesome. Great graphics and action. I wish more games would be life this one.

1416955070|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I became hooked and had to pry myself from this book to get back to real life. The biggest part of the book for me was the end, in which a very big twist shocked me and made me rethink the whole book. I am rating it four stars for two reasons: the first, because a few parts of the book bored me and made me want to skip ahead a little to see what was going to happen next. Second, because the very end of the novel was very wordy, and all I wanted to do was find out more about the twist. The very end of the novel is a blur for me because I really just skimmed it.<br />I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good action book with a little bit of romance in it. You will want to read it before the movie comes out!

B002X1MUXY|2.0|INCESTICIDE got some decent Nirvana songs like DIVE, ANEURYSM and Sliver...but is by far the worst album by nirvana...Nevermind and In Utero are good albuns, but this one and their debut BLEACH are really not so good...Well, the nirvana mania is totally unexplicable...i think if someone deserve to be a Grunge legend, it got to be Alice in Chains, 100 times better than nirvana...
B002JVWR54|4.0|Series two largely abandons Series one's reliance on standalone episodes and instead accelerates the main plot. The series creators obviously knew that the writing was on the wall, because it races at a breakneck pace to wrap up before it hits the end.<br />It does feel rushed at times, but the story is good enough that you won't mind too much. And at least, unlike Firefly, this series had a proper ending.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|RIO is a really nice animation...The musics are beautiful and the visual are magnificient...the story is good, and i gotta say that the producers really done a great job demonstrating what Rio, as a city is about...even the Rio problems are show in a nice and funny way...Really nice, i´ve seen Rio many times and i recommend to everyone in the world!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|This is a really good book and is definitely worth reading, especially if you saw the movie and left with more questions than anything else.<br /><br />It is not perfectly written, and if a bit \\"convenient\\" at times, but still very entertaining and easy read.

B0037TPMOA|5.0|It took me a long time to get around to reading The Shining, but once I started I couldn't put my kindle down.<br /><br />Superbly written and one of King's less eccentric novels. Absolutely 100% worth reading.
0316098329|5.0|Strong praise for this book. I loved it and I was sad to see it end (though I think it ended at the perfect place). Emma Donnaghue came up with such an interesting and unique way of telling this story. Her character development was fascinating and believable. Words and images from the story still reverberate in my head.I have recommended it to everyone and I know that I will read it again.
0345803485|3.0|So I after hearing all the ranting and raving about this novel, I decided to download it onto my Kindle. Let me start off as saying, if you are looking for some form of cheap entertainment then you might enjoy this book. I have to say it is addicting. I am a sucker for love stories and drama, so of course, I was sucked into the storyline and just had to find out what happens. However, if you are the type of person who appreciates great literature that involves vocabulary, themes, and symbolism, then this book is definitely not for you! The storyline of the novel involves a young, inexperienced college graduate who becomes entranced by this wealthy dysfunctional man and then they have a lot of sex and then they fight, and then they have a lot of sex and then they fight, and then they -- well you get the picture. It goes on and on like this throughout this book, and the second book in the trilogy. This is definitely not a piece of great literature. This is a form of cheap entertainment that tells a dysfunctional love story with a ton of sex scenes strung together. To be honest, the trilogy is just one giant sex scene. The main girl, Ana, is definitely not a heroine in my eyes. I don't understand how all of these women think she is so brilliant. She is the stupidest, most naive character. I am about her age in the novels, and if some rich guy I just met took me to his apartment and showed me his \\"playroom\\" with genital clamps and whips and other torture devices, I would leave, not lose my virginity to him! And the sad thing is, she's not even after his money, which would be the only thing that could possibly keep me hanging around. But whatever floats your boat, I guess. Not going to lie, the book was entertaining and slightly addicting, but it definitely wasn't the greatest book ever written, more like a trashy romance novel.

1419702238|4.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. It was a great read with lots of humor that made me chuckle on almost every page. The wit of the author was excellent, it was almost like a stand-up act with a constant flow of funny small stories and thoughts that came together to form a book. I'll probably borrow other books of this author from my son's bookshelf.
0307592731|4.0|I would not exactly call this a memoir, nor would I call it a good hiking journal, having followed several through hikers journals. But, I would call this a good read. This was a person that needed to make some changes in her life, and yes, she was woefully unprepared for hiking the PCT, but she did it. She perservered, made some dumb mistakes (but hey, that's how we learn) and when she finished, she was on her way to being the person she envisioned for herself. That's what this book was about. She hiked the PCT....how many of us would take on that challenge? This was not about the PCT itself, and if you're looking for that book, don't look here. This was a book of a life change, and a successful one at that. Good for you Ms. Strayed. I enjoyed this book.

B005K17RU0|3.0|This app works just fine on my new Kindle Fire; and provides more information than the comparable Weather Channel app. That having been said, I ended up removing it from my Kindle because it would not stay off and used excessive memory. The Weather Channel app isn't as feature-rich but at least it behaves itself.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was fun but confusing at times and every time you beat a game an add pops up for one of their other products. the games werse good but they could be better.
006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium is the second installment in the Delirium trilogy and I could not put this book down!  It was better than the first book, which is usually not the case.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a awesome game. love the old school Mario feel. really easy game but still could play this all day. good
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part. I believe in a good love story that could possibly happen and the way that these two people love each other are pretty realistic. I have actually known people just like them in real life. And they were a beautiful disaster as well but lived happily ever after. I think that there could have been a little more character development with the background characters, especially America and Shepley because they were as much as the story as Travis and Abby were. Overall, if you are into books that give you an overall good feeling when you are done reading it, this is the book for you.
B0000019HU|1.0|I downloaded this music for free thank goodness just because of all the five star reviews. After listening to this album I have my doubts about these five star reviews. Not much to say about the album except I was totally disappointed. The album was monotonous and boring to the extreme. Almost all of the songs sounded the same. The same guitar rifts, slow beat, and jamming on each song. The song Washer was so so, but was ruined by the lyrics of the lead singer. It sounds like a group of guys in their late teens/early twenties(which they probably were) in a garage just jamming with no common goal or purpose with each band member having their own direction or agenda. No band assimilation whatsoever. To make matters worse the lead singer is not actually singing but just occasionally speaking or telling a story. Fortunately he speaks so low that you can't even tell what he's saying with headphones on. Not that it matters what he's saying anyway.<br /><br />The band reminds me just a little of a much less talented and interesting version of the great band Bedhead.  Bottom line this album was terrible and would never even consider listening to their other music.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|thanks for listening to all our requests and finally getting this app....ive been playing it on my daughters tablet so im happy to now have it on my fire!
0061733199|5.0|Excellent book, very well written and instructions are clear and concise. Just thumbing through it, it has common plants and their picture next to them and a short description of their properties and benefits(or harms!). And also rope knots, food sources, weapons, shelter, survival first aid just to name a few. I was impressed and would highly recommend it.
B0073XORCY|5.0|starting where TAAB part 1 ended TAAB part 2 flows seemlessly with the story of<br />what if or what had become. Ian Anderson's new band well the sound like Jethro Tull. this CD put a smilee on my face 30 seconds into it. A must for any Tull fan.
0345803485|5.0|I have never been more emotionally involved in two people I'm reading about. I don't want to give away the story line so all I'm going to say is I cry for the last 15 pages of this book uncontrollably and for an hour after. And was so inconsolable I decided to start reading the 2nd book right away just to continue on this journey with these two people. I have to say I'm way more emotionally connected to Mr. Grey and his troubled past- I can relate and therefore I understand him. I on the other hand do NOT understand Ana but love her any! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will not be disappointed
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|fun. fun. fun! I'm addicted to the game. if u like pictionary u will love this too. pity you cant switch games in between rounds
B007BRJYF2|2.0|I usually love HO games but even though I had no problems with the downloaded others have mentioned I wish I had......not downloaded.  Even with my KFire on the brightest setting and zoomed in most of the objects seemed invisible. That and being on a short timer that kept making you start over made for frustration and a lack of any fun. I requested a refund from Amazon but hope to save others the trouble. I can't understand the high reviews but maybe their vision is super enhanced. The graphics I did see since I never got past the first screen were childish &amp; disappointing as well. Allnin all an app to pass on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided to read this book after listening to my friends go on and on about how fantastic it was.  I have to admit I was hooked immediately.  I found myself entranced in this story.  I could not get enough.  I had the book finished in less than a week and have already purchased book 2.  I don't understand the bad reviews.  I found myself drawn into Christian's world.  I highly recommend this book.  Very sexy and intriguing.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A very enlightening and quite possibly a life changing book.  At the same time it can be disheartening.  If you keep an open mind and accept all that Anita describes it's not exactly a happy ending, everything is positive and right in the world type discovery.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I wasn't sure what the book was about before I got it and I started reading it because of it's popularity.  I was so greatly disappointed in it, as it doesn't seem to have any substance and I felt it was near pornagraphic.  There was no plot to speak of.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, found it hard to put down to go to bed! Keeps the suspense going until the end. Well written & enjoyable. Now on to the 2nd one!

B00466HN72|5.0|Was very happy with the delivery time of the product and the condition of the movie. Movie was also very good and something my 5 year old watches ALL the time.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game looks fantastic, fanciful and original. The graphics are quirky and colorful. An amusingly fun game and a steal at 99 cents! Other developers could take a page out of Alawar Entertainment's book and not charge exorbitant prices for quality apps. Looking forward to more apps from this developer.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|After watching the movie In Time, you tend to wonder what if our world today ran like that also? Where time truly is money and that you literally have a certain period of time to live. That's not even half your lifetime and you have so much more to live for. You can definitely say that In Time reflects the dystopian ideals because the society is divided into social classes of the rich and the poor. A dystopian society represents different kinds of repressive social control systems and the societies within the dystopian worlds often explore the concept of humans abusing technology. Societies are often pictured as police states with unlimited power and control over the citizens. Just like a dystopia, the society set within In Time has this social class for the rich and poor called Time Zones, and for those who live in the poor have to work every single day just to earn a few more hours to live. And if your clock reaches zero you die automatically. However, for the rich they have unlimited time and usually live for centuries. Everyone looks young because for those who are unfortunate only live 25 years. The use of technology is used throughout the whole film because they use an internal clock that controls their whole body. I believe that the use of technology was ultimately abused because it was used in a way to control the matter between life and death for humans. While watching the film it really made me think about how unnatural it was to use technology as a new way of controlling someone's life, and it definitely was abusing technology because I believe it should be used in a way to help us progress in our future, not end it. Automatically you can tell everything was different within the society now that time really was a major issue. You were paid with time and not money, which also really shocked me because your time was your money and everything you need, your time was involved. Money was not needed anymore for this new world. As the police usually have the power within a dystopian society, the police in the movie also had the power and control over the citizens. The police in the movie mad sure that everything ran smoothly and was in its right place. When the police found out that someone was giving more time than they were suppose to, they quickly acted on that and treated the citizen as a victim in the society. Reasons for this was because they wanted to make sure that those who lived in the poor stayed there, and living in the poor was the fastest way for people to die.<br /><br />-Gio Bonadie
B007R41E8O|5.0|This was a superb game. Priced at 99 cents, it's a great value. Just goes to show that good quality, well done apps do not have to be unreasonably priced. Nice help feature guides you if you get stuck without having to search all over the internet for a walkthrough. A bit long on the download time but patience IS a virtue! The game wasn't too short; right amount of difficulty, all in all a first-rate app.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|Robert Plant found his new (true?)identity on this album.  He wasn't the cock rocker from the 70's anymore with that 'other' band, and he was settled in a new phase of his life: solo artist and single.  His first solo album was somewhat transitional, sounding a lot like LZ and occasionally touching on his divorce.<br /><br />In this album, he is more reflective and exploratory - both in the music and the lyrics.  I've always felt this album was the perfect Robert Plant vehicle.  He is a singer, first and foremost, and this album let's that golden voice take the spotlight.  The music is indeed 'ominous melancholy\\" and is constructed in a way to be non-obstructive.  Basically, a subdued (not including the rocker 'Wreckless Love') and atmospheric sonic backdrop was created to act as a platform for Robert's voice to 'walk around' on: there are hills and valleys, strange stairs that climb and drop, and the mood is consistent throughout.<br /><br />Robert's voice has never sounded better (well ... maybe on the Honeydrippers album but that's another review), and as others have mentioned in their reviews, 'Big Log' is a highlight.  His vocals on this song are the stuff dreams are made of.  Other highlights are 'Thru with the Two Step' and the wonderful and very 80's 'In the Mood'.<br /><br />When I first heard this album, I was in high school and loved it.  As I got older, and went through my share of relationships, I 'got' this album a lot more as there really is a lot of relationship-oriented stuff on here, both pre and post divorce in Plant's life.<br /><br />While this album is definitely a grower, it is more than worth every one of the five stars I gave it.  Essential listening.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down from beginning to end. All 3 books are just amazing! I think people of any age could enjoy and even learn from this thrilling series.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The production is great. The books are great. And all the background information in the special features really helped me understand both. It's worth having the Blu-ray because it's so beautifully filmed.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I do like this game to pass the time when I'm bored.  I just have one gripe.  There are many levels that Ive achieved that says I have opened up various new foods.  However they do not show up and I think that's a problem.  I am on the same level with many of my neighbors but I notice they have a variety of foods that I don't.  if this was fixed id give it 5 stars....
0545425115|5.0|This book is a must-read kind of book. It's storyline is amazing and it's imagery was excellent. Before I bought it, many people told me to read this book. And now I am. Already up to Part II. If you don't have it, get it.
B006T5FDLG|3.0|Metallica have some potential left after making this album, it's not the best but it's a good EP. It has some b-sides from their previous release Death Magnetic from back in 2008. It's a good comeback from there disaster with Lou Reed \\"Lulu\\". The songs are the traditional thrash metal and hard rock Metallica. It's a good alternative to their previous work and it's a lot like Garage Inc. which was a good alternative to their mid '90 era.
0312323867|3.0|My daughter and I watched the movie [[ASIN:B004EPZ070 Something Borrowed]] and I had to find out what happened with all the characters.

B004EPZ03O|4.0|Thirty years after \\"The Muppet Show\\" went off  the air, I wondered what a new Muppet movie would have to offer. Apparently, its creators were wondering the same thing, because \\"The Muppets\\" asks, literally, if the Muppets are still relevant in today's world. Walter (Peter Linz) is a Muppet who grew up with a human brother Gary (Jason Segel), and he is a huge fan of The Muppets well into adulthood. Gary plans an anniversary trip to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Walter. There they discover that the Muppets have disbanded, and Muppet Studios will fall into the hands of an oil baron (Chris Cooper) who wants to tear it down unless Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) can buy the theater back for $10 million. They only way to do that is to host a Muppet Telethon with all the old gang.<br /><br />Though \\"The Muppet Show\\" was intended to entertain children and adults alike, it always seemed like the words were intended for the adults and the actions were aimed at the children in the audience. \\"The Muppets\\", the movie, actually parodies children's programming at times. The self-consciously corny musical numbers are all parodies of something. There is some stinging humor and vicious mockery here, couched in smiling song and dance numbers. There are also the requisite comic interactions between the Muppet performers: Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson), Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson), Gonzo (David Goelz), and the rest. I have to admit it's nice to see the Muppets again, especially once the Telethon gets underway.<br /><br />I was surprised by how reflexive \\"The Muppets\\" is, but the relevance or irrelevance of The Muppets is an obvious choice of theme, isn't it? If the filmmakers were wondering how much audience a Muppet movie could possibly have in 2011, why not make the movie about that very subject? It's more economical than searching for other inspiration. When Kermit wants to host a Muppet Telethon to raise money to save the studio, no network wants him. The motley crew of fuzzy puppets are assumed to no longer be relevant. Even Tex Richman, the oil baron, says so. Well, Kermit gets a break and a chance to find out if The Muppets can play to a modern audience. And the filmmakers found their answer in those box office receipts.motley crew of fuzzy puppets are assumed to no longer be relevant. Even Tex Richman, the oil baron, says so.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Retired professional who was concerned this was really just for teenagers.  Many adult friends enjoyed this book.  Not literary--but compelling and enjoyable.  Have read all three of the books and I kept turning the pages to see what would happen., next.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|A cleverly crafted novel, which is a good read.  The repeated expressions of angst -- mostly questions of spousal fidelity -- become tiresome, however.  After reading 2/3 of the book, I was ready to give it away, but the ending was worth the frustration.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first Rose Gardner Mystery novel and I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment in this series.  This was a light-hearted novel, but was packed with romance, mystery and laughs.  I read it in less than a day and was left wanting more!

B00000J2SR|3.0|Rainbow never fails to impress, and this album is no exception. This is the third and the last album of the Joe Lynn Turner era. It's not as good as Difficult to Cure or Straight Between the Eyes, but its got some good songs on it that make it worth the purchase-Standed, Can't Let You Go, Desperate Heart, and Street of Dreams but none of the others really stand out. If you're not a diehard fan and you already have their greatest hits, you can probably pass on this one.
B000002KO3|5.0|This is the first album by the Talking Heads I've bought, mainly because they were one of those bands I'd never got around to listening to (except for hearing their pop singles on the radio) but kept hearing about as if they were important.<br /><br />Well I have to say I like this album, which seems to me to have two distinct halves to it.<br /><br />The first half is flat out, high energy chaotic funkiness. It's incredibly over the top, and I think it is probably the closest thing music can provide for a cure to depression. I put it on in the car, and immediately I felt compelled to start shaking my head like a monkey on crack. Good stuff.<br /><br />In the middle we have the track \\"Once In A Lifetime\\", which feels a bit different from the rest of the album. It's a more mellow and uplifting kind of track, I'm sure everyone knows this one because it is a radio staple.<br /><br />The second half is much more dark and serious in tone, with David Byrne quietly reciting lyrics like he's telling a story in some parts. It all ends on a track called The Overload, which is more or less the same thing as Joy Division's closing track \\"I Know Nothing\\" from Unknown Pleasures: droning and heavy and quite oppressive.<br /><br />So overall it is quite bi-polar, but also very fun and every track is a good one.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Soft leather, even a well-worn look to it. Kindle fits perfectly. Stays shut when not using it. Does everything I expected. I'm proud to carry it. My one suggestion would be that somebody PLEASE make one with a pocket for the power cord/charger. I hate having to pack them separately when going on an extended trip where I know I will need one. Too many different pieces to keep track of then.
B005N7CA3A|2.0|I have been a fan of Darren's music since the early days.  I adore his charming personality and his quick wit, and I wish him all the best life has to offer.  I will always cherish when I actually got to meet him during his Borders tour in November of 2007.  I consider myself extremely lucky to actually meet one of my idols.<br /><br />That being said, I am sad that, with regard to my opinion of \\"Secret Codes and Battleships\\", I am not in the majority.  While I do respect how much work he has put into the album and how important it is to him, it feels like a step backward, musically speaking.  When I bought \\"This Delicate Thing We've Made\\", it accompanied me on every lunch break spent in my car in 2007/2008.  I was sure that SCBS would enjoy the same longevity, considering the fact that Darren is back on a major label and was incorporating such elements as an orchestra and big-name producers, yet I was rather disappointed with it.  His mainstream pop lyrics are not as poignant as are his indie-pop lyrics, with the exception of \\"Black Out the Sun\\", and if I could sum up the album in a word, I would use \\"fluff\\".  This record did not resonate with me as strongly as the rest of his catalog has, and after reading many people's reviews of how they enjoy the originality, I fail to see it.  I never thought Darren could disappoint me, but then I guess he wrote \\"Hero\\" (from Tension and the Spark) for a reason.<br /><br />Bottom line: Love Darren, love his catalog, but this one let me down.  Though, I still look forward to the day when I can see him live in concert, and I look forward to the next album that he is probably already working on, knowing him.  ;)

B0059XTTW8|1.0|The Smiley novels can best be described as \\"character driven\\" novels, in the spirit of any Graham Greene novel, but written by David Cornwell.<br /><br />So, how is it possible to make this film adaptation successfully and coherent if you don't bother developing any of the characters?  Answer, you can't and this movie suffers for it.  The mole, Bill Hayden doesn't utter one word in the entire movie and therefore you have no idea as to his motivation.  You don't know anybody's motivation in the movie as George Smiley is the only crucial character to utter any lines in the movie and it's like George Smiley is sleep-walking through the entire movie.<br /><br />The producers, director, and anybody else responsible for this trash should be barred from ever making another movie, and that includes Gary Oldman, for whom I had held in great esteem . . . No more.<br /><br />Please, go out and buy the original version of Tinker Tailor, Soldier, Spy and forget the Oldman version.  You won't regret it.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Prepare to be amazed. George Martin did well with his first two books, but this one doesn't even compare. A Storm of Swords is by far the BEST fantasy novel I have EVER read! The nonstop action will keep you on your feet from beginning to end, and you will never want to put this book down! Martin outdoes his own standards with constant plot twists, new characters, and surprises that will have you staring at the page in disbelief. A Storm of Swords is, by far, the best book in A Song of Ice and Fire series.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robie be able to handle three women in his life?<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read several of Baldacci's books before, but it has been a long time. I forget how thrilling and satisfying they can be. If you like thrill, relationships, romance, and non-stop action this book is for you.<br /><br />Will Robie kills for a living. He normally works alone, but finds himself in a situation that he is not able to be alone or risk someone innocent losing their life. He becomes a juggler at this point and hopes he is doing it right.<br /><br />Julie Getty is the first \\"woman\\" in his life. She is 14 and full of life. She's pretty smart for her age, not only school wise but street wise. She surprises Robie time and time again.<br /><br />Agent Vance is the older woman in his life who is in the same career field and respects what he is doing. They work side by side, but develop a close relationship.<br /><br />Annie Lambert is the sexy, seductress, neighbor. He finds himself caught up with her and wonders if it is okay.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Will Robie was portrayed as a tough, but sensitive at the right times male. He was smart and knew how to read what was going on. While it was difficult, he did allow the woman to work with and help him in the investigation.<br /><br />Julie Getty is a tough little cookie. What she went through and what she finds out in the end is amazing. She is portrayed as a very smart girl (intelligent), but she was also caring and forgiving.<br /><br />Agent Vance was your typical female cop, but didn't over do the toughness to prove who she was. Baldacci was able to describe her a competent, but not overcompensating. She did learn to let her guard down a little.<br /><br />Don't expect just thriller, suspense, and toughness in this book. Baldacci does add some humor along the way.

0765316994|5.0|In the Star Trek show, whenever a main character goes on an away mission, an extra wearing a red shirt usually dies. In \\"Redshirts\\", the main characters are the people that would wear the red shirt. The main character, Ensigh Dahl, notices really weird things happening on the ship and wants to find a way to save his friends from dying on an away expedition. The satire of bad sci-fi TV is hilarious. The book has very funny moments and it moves at a nice pace. It is a short novel (a little over 200 pages), which is a nice length for a parody. After the novel ends, there are three codas, touching on the after lives of three different characters. All three codas are more serious in nature and are worth reading.<br /><br />Overall, a quick, fun, entertaining read. I recommend it.

B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Silly pun yes but pretty true to me. It was 1982. Led Zeppelin was long gone. And Robert Planet was ready to embark on a solo career that promised a lot of success.  Considering the era choosing Genesis/Brand X drummer Phil Collins was a great choice. It's apparent Plant was looking to create a sound for himself that while removed from what he'd been doing in Zeppelin would'nt repell any admirers he'd earned during those years. The band he had here was a small one. Of course the main concern must've been the guitarist. Turned out to be Robbie Blunt. With a playing style as theatrical and varied as Jimmy Page but with an ability to smooth out to period specifications,he turned out to be just what Plant needed at this point.  Not to mention Blunt co-wrote many of these tunes as well. Of  course an album can have all the right people involved but still have the end result fall flat. Luckily that was not what happened here by a long shot.<br /><br />  This is an excellent pop-rock album. Really nothing like Zeppelin at all. But in some ways does have some similarities to period Genesis. In particular with it's use of reverb and echo. Honestly on some of these songs I have no clue what Plant is singing about. But that is part of it's musical uniqueness  too. \\"Burning Down One Side\\",\\"Slow Dance\\",\\"Worse Than Detroit\\" and \\"Mystery Title\\" are bluesy,deep rockers with heavy grooves that drive right along very well. \\"Moonlight In Samoa\\" is a dynamic midtempo ballad. Very interesting for someone who admitted that once \\"loathed English pop\\". Shows an important growth process. The ska/reggae pop styled \\"Pledge Pin\\" and the bluesy pop/funk styled \\"Fat Lip\\" both explore the more rhythmic style of this album. That bluesier style comes to mind on the more epic \\"Like It's Never Been Before\\",presented here in an elongated live opus among the bonus cuts along with the bouncy pop/rock of \\"Far Post\\"<br /><br />  At a time where changes in rock n roll seemed to be happening at all too fast a pace,it's interesting how in the mid 1980's everything settled down into a couple basic sounds to choose from. But in the first few years of the 80's there were a lot of creatively and commercial viable genres to deal with. You had pop,rock,funk,soul,punk (or post punk anyway),new wave and synth pop. And the more different ways you could combine them,the better. In 1982 there was still quite a lot of that innovative spirit of the 60's/70's culture left in the music world. And this album really embraced that. He may not have had a supergroup consisting of all legendary musicans to fall back on anymore. But his writing,singing and production were perfect indicators he'd have a fine career ahead of him. And it turns out it's been a steady road from this point on because he never has,nor seems to have any intention of stopping until he just can't do it anymorea pace,it's interesting how in the mid 1980's everything settled down into a couple basic sounds to choose from.

B000HWZ5W4|4.0|Robert Plant's debut [[ASIN:B000HWZ5VU Pictures At Eleven]] showcased he obviously had the ability to deal with life outside of Led Zeppelin. And he actually chose to follow it up very close on. The following year in fact with this album. It's pretty much the next logical step musically. But there are some key differences. The same basic band is still onboard. The excellent Robbie Blunt is still on guitar and Phil Collins is still on drums. But so is Barriemore Barlow. Also it's boutful anyone is going to mistaken this for a carbon copy of Plant's debut set either.<br /><br />  Overall this is a somewhat poppier and more uniform sounding album than the previous album. With more attention on song craft than instrumentation.  Everything is very well oiled from  the light country rock influenced \\"I'm In The Mood\\",the bluesy \\"Wreckless Love\\" and \\"Other Arms\\" as well as the rhythmically dynamic \\"Thru With The Two Step\\"  and \\"Stranger Here Than Over There\\" all have different flavors but maintain a certain slickness throughtout. Even with the more rhythmic \\"Messin With The Mekon\\",this definitely has a more AOR type flavor musically. The album closes with the forboding and poetic \\"Big Log\\",the only real ballad on the album and probably it's most popular tune. The bonus tracks,aside from the bluesy groove of \\"Turnaround\\" are enthusiastic live versions of some of these albums songs. Sort of a mini audio concert as it were.<br /><br />  So while this doesn't quite have the same variety of sound and sonics as Plant's debut album this is an excellent and balanced album creatively that manages to also be very contemporary for it's time. Not only that is has the advantage of holding up very well over the years generally. Plant woud continue to make solo albums after this. Growing,experimenting and continually forging ahead in terms of his sound would prove very much to his advantage. This represents the only time where he might've really drifted close to something somewhat radio friendly. But it's still Robert Plant all the way. And bursts out with his own energy level.riendly. But it's still Robert Plant all the way. And bursts out with his own energy level.
0374203032|2.0|I'm afraid this book is likely to give \\"moral philosophers\\" a bad name. And it isn't simply because the dust jacket uses the \\"bait and switch\\" technique of praise: big names are trotted out to commend the author on the strength of another - excellent - book: Justice, rather than this far less valuable effort. The current product reads like a collation of excerpts from term papers the author has gathered in his undergraduate course, lightly mixed with thin moral sauce.<br /><br />Take the first section: \\"Jumping the queue\\". Out of 21 pages, about 16 are forgettable anecdotes repeating the same point; the rest is reflection. The author misses the fundamental point: queues are more a market than a moral mechanism. The \\"currency\\" in this kind of market is the disutility of having to wait in line. One can legitimately either charge a price, or ask people to queue. When both pricing mechanisms are made to coexist, however, trouble starts: the currency of \\"queing\\" is debased and it no longer works - consumers no longer are treated equally (a necessity for a well-functioning market). It's like bi-metallism: parallel currencies are incompatible with each other and create havoc at speculators try to arbitrage. Collaterally one may ask - strictly in market terms - why should a third party (the scalper, the firm that hires place-keepers in the queue) be allowed to skim off \\"consumer surplus\\"? To do so is to pervert the functioning of markets, which reject monopolies, even third party ones. Again, the matter needs no morals, only insights in how a market works, or fails.<br /><br />On the other hand the author misses the social and political implications of queuing to participate in a Congressional hearing. These hearings are one of the few places left for Mr. Public to make his concerns known to the Legislative, if nothing else by showing up. Packing the hearing with paid partisanship lowers the democratic debate. Atmospherics count, and Congressmen need also to feel the \\"willof the people\\" rather than just the \\"will of the lobbies\\".<br /><br />The second section, on \\"incentives\\", is even worse. The author misses the whole point of \\"incentives\\": incentives are a half-way house between regulation and indifference of the legislator (see: [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]). They are indicative rather than prescriptive, and allow the person to adapt and adjust. There is much merit in \\"nudging\\" people, rather than forcing them to comply: it allows for flexibility and exceptions. Nudging also lowers compliance costs significantly - all points worth considering.<br /><br />What the author also misses - and this is a core point - is the fact that \\"economics\\" is not so much about dollars and cents as about choices in a material context. The author cites Gary Becker disapprovingly for stating: \\"I have come to the position that the economic approach is a comprehensive one that is applicable to all human behavior...\\" (pg. 49). But Gary Becker is right. If I have one op-room and two very sick patients, I must make choices and tradeoffs and so much moralism about \\"life being invaluable\\" will not help. How best to call this judgment is a matter of proper balancing of material as well as moral benefits and costs - one that an ethical committee of MDs will be familiar with. And irreconcilable material considerations will be in the forefront. Over time, coherence and consistence are needed - on moral grounds. All of this is the stuff of properly understood \\"economics\\" - the art of balancing considerations.<br /><br />The author finally misses two fundamental points about markets. Markets are based on legal contracts - signposts established by society and determining the conditions for transactions. The corrosive effect of the market ideology arises when moving the legal signposts can become a matter for negotiation in accordance with \\"benefits and costs\\". It is a well-known economic theorem that any \\"constraint\\" reduces profits, so de-regulation (moving or eliminating goal-posts) axiomatically means more profits. Deregulation always \\"pays\\". But when there are no rules left, the gun rules - naked power. Markets emerge through social institutions, yet undermine them. Politically countervailing forces are needed to keep it from destroying society and in the end, itself.<br /><br />The other core issue has to do with division of labor, on which markets are based. Division of labor puts the individual into a schizophrenic stance. In a minimal area he is pro-active and professional; the rest of the time, and in particular his private life, he accepts passively the expertise of other professionals. \\"Think locally\\" - is the mantra. This is abdication from responsibility for the whole - be it for himself or society - and the beginning of the end.<br /><br />PS: Jeremy WALDRON has published a review of this book in the August 16 issue of the New York Review of Books. Though more guarded is his formulations it appears to me that he is making essentially similar points. He notes \\"over 100 examples\\" - my point that in this aspect may be overrepresented. He comments \\"I think [SANDEL] wants to open the discussion up rather than nail it down\\". Between a simple \\"opening\\" and the ultimative \\"nailing it down\\" there is, however, the \\"framing the discussion\\" in such a way as to facilitate rational analysis. WALDRON points to the seminal work of Michael WALZER [[ASIN:0465081894 Spheres Of Justice: A Defense Of Pluralism And Equality]], which SANDEL has reviewed [[ASIN:067402365X Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics]], but failed to engage in this latest offering. A pity.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci is never bad, and it is too early to say that this book represents a decline in his powers.  Still, this is middle drawer stuff.  The plot is simple enough.  Will, the hero, is an assassin working for the usual \\"shadowy government agency\\" which targets individuals whose removal is necessary but deniable.  After many successful missions, he returns to the United States with instructions to kill a female mid-level government employee.  He refuses to do so; she is killed anyway, and he is targeted himself.  Meanwhile, a spunky-but-vulnerable 14-year old girl loses her parents to an assassination, and joins forces with the hero and a spunky-but-skeptical female FBI agent.  In Baldacci's favor (for avoiding at least one cliche), his agency concludes that he has done nothing wrong and aids him on the mission.  After much chaos, matters resolve.<br /><br />Baldacci never writes badly and he keeps the action moving.  But the book has a tired feel.  The identity of the villainous assassin is all to obvious all to early.  The real villains remain in the shadows until almost the end -- which is too bad; Baldacci is very good at creating villains.  The two shootout finales are relatively weak:  the one in Washington is too perfunctory and the one in the Middle East is too easy.  \\"Thriller\\" heros are always one-dimensional, but this one seems more so than usual (the Camel Club members are one dimensional, too, but each character's dimension is at least interesting).  The kid is too precious.  And it sounds odd to say this in a genre as far-fetched as the political thriller, but the plot is not far-fetched enough.  The villains are all too omnipotent in their operations until the heros get on top of them, and all too incompetent once they do.  It should not have taken a five-page denoument to explain what the villains' game was.  While Baldacci is a much better wordsmith than Robert Ludlum (at least before he died), this book all too often reads like mid-period Ludlum without the energy.<br /><br />Sorry for all the criticism.  It is still a page-turner, well written, and fun to read.  It is just not everything one expects from this author.thout the energy.<br /><br />Sorry for all the criticism.

0985114606|3.0|This book started out really good. I loved Gideon in the beginning the best. I wished he had taken a bit longer to change from the crude guy we met at first. Don't get me wrong, I liked that he fell hard for Ava and was willing to change, but I was hoping that he would have been more of a challenge. It would have given the story a little more angst.He gave into Ava's demands way too quick and easy before he even got to know her, and it didn't ring true from the guy he was made out to be when the book first started. The story started getting a little tedious after a while for me because Ava had him wrapped around her little finger from the get go so their little arguments seemed useless. The only way I would continue reading this series is unless the next one is going to be more about Cary finding a girl that could whip him into shape. Not a bad book overall. Ten times better written than Fifty Shades Of Grey. Very steamy.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I love romance novels and was really looking forward to reading this one based on the good reviews. The plot was so horrible that I could barely get through this book. The relationship in this book was beyond dysfunctional, the characters shallow and under developed, and the fighting was ridiculous.  Travis seems to me to be a slutty, bi-polar control freak with a rage problem and Abby is so insecure she confuses his behavior with love. It was also strange to me that Travis could go around beating people in cafeterias, at bars, in school basements and yet never gets in trouble with the law? He also goes around sleeping with all these girls and Abby (a virgin)  can't even dance with someone? By the end of the book I was hoping somehow it would turn around and she would realize she was worth more and deserved someone better (but just like the rest of the plot the end was ridiculous!) I hated these characters by the time I finished reading, they had few redeeming qualities and if this book was supposed to be even a little realistic it failed miserably!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series. It seems that people forget that YOUNG ADULTS, the genre that this series is aimed to, are the one's that are actually fighting wars, such as the one going on now. I happen to be a young adult who is married to an iraq purple heart veteran. In this book we see katniss change from a young naive warrior into what can only be described as a modern day veteran returning home from war. This series may be fiction, but in conveys the real struggles of soldier's and what they go through. PTSD is a huge problem with most veterans, and this book doesn't sugarcoat it. I applaud Suzane Collins for having the courage to write the truth about war. It's not that Katniss wasn't a strong heroine in this story, because she definitely was. It's that at the end of the day, Katniss is human, and she went through many very traumatic experiences. I hope that this book can help anyone thinking about joining the army reconsider if it is the right choice for them.

B0060QM0AG|5.0|I've read this book before, and was delighted to read it once again. James Herriot mixes life stories with veterinary experiences to make truly enjoyable reading. Each chapter is a little story in itself, so it's also an easy book to read out loud to someone (as I did to my Dad when he was hospitalized). It's also a good book to read right before bed to wind down. If you love animals, or books about people living their lives, you'll love this book.

All the compositions are pure, fresh, well written and easy to listen, especially \\"Life in dark water\\". The saxophone is great. Essential for all the Al Stewart fans.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I cannot deny that this book will spark sexual emotion while reading it, the sex scenes are hot for the most part and quite erotic. On the other hand the book is very poorly written and therefore the erotica the only thing that keeps it afloat and allows me to give it two stars. For a story that is meant to be set in modern times the author uses language that feels as if this story is occurring in another century. You will not go ten pages without the word \\"panties\\" being used or the blatant disregard for human anatomy. For whatever reason the author of this erotic novel never once calls the vagina by its name or any of its synonyms but instead refers to it as \\"sex\\", as in \\"he touched my sex\\". I found many of these small writing quirks throughout the novel and thought it very distracting odd for the type of book it is trying to be. In all I don't think the novel is worth anything other than its erotic scenes for your own pleasure.

0670023329|5.0|Only in leftist socialist countries to the horrible camps exist. National Socialism had it's death camps; the Soviet Union had it Gulags; China and Viet Nam had and have reeducation centers for reactionary dissenters; Pol Pot's Marxist regime had it's killing fields; Cuba has forced labor camps.<br /><br />This book reinforces what most of us already know: The Left (Liberals and their kissing cousin Communists) will not tolerate dissent.<br /><br />Should liberals ever manage to circumvent our constitution, the camps in America will follow. Even now, Occupy protester call for death to capitalists and reeducation camps. A liberal is merely a Communist constrained by constitutional democracy. Their ideology of an overbearing, centralized and all powerful government is the last stop on the way to Marxist totalitarianism.

0545425115|3.0|I have to admit when a friend loaned me this book I wan't expecting too much. I wasn't even planning on reading it with all the hype the movie was getting it didn't seem like my thing. I'm glad I did though! It wasn't at all what I thought it was- but in a good way! I loved the style of writing the author used and the story line was so creative. As soon as I started reading it- I was hooked! Great characters and interesting plots and twists. I love trilogy books too- so I'm on book 2 now and I bet the next one will be evn better. Although I'm not sure why they keep comparing this book to Twilight. I am a Twilight fan and I can tell you they are two totally different genres of books. The only similarity they have is the possible love triangle and that the authors have great writing. Definitly recommend it!

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|From top to bottom, whether it's acting, sets, costumes, dialogue, or story, this is simply the best fantasy series ever made for television (well, to be fair HBO is a sight better than television). This box set has plenty of extra features, and is priced very well. Highly recommended for everyone who isn't a prude!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|very fun game.  needs to have notifications and needs the ability do quit or cancel a game.  for those who are not familiar with Draw Something, essentially you pick from three words (easy, medium, or hard) and draw it.  your friends and family get a replay of you drawing the picture and some letters with which to guess.  then they do the same for you to guess.  it turns out to be loads of fun.
B002U6CJCE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Jean-Claude Van Damme movies. As of this moment I am the owner of about 6 Van Damme movies on blu-ray. I realize that most of his movies are a little lacking and are far from being oscar-worthy material, but there's something about the awkwardness of the Muscles from Brussels that makes him very compelling. He is not the greatest actor ever, but you can't help but root for him. It's like he's the ultimate under-dog. The guy who can't catch a break, but always beats the odds anyways. I love the original Universal Soldier, and I have never seen the oft-maligned sequel. I purchased the original Universal Soldier a few years ago on a whim, when I first discovered Van Damme and his peculiar way of emoting. I was smitten. I love action movies. Particularly ones that are bombastic and entertaining. I had heard that US: The Return was a major failure, so I decided to be content with the first movie. Flash forward a few months, and I stumbled upon the trailer for this movie. At first I was very wary. I mean, let's face it, Van Damme is not a major name anymore and most direct-to-home video releases are horrible. I read a few reviews, and I saw a few clips, and I decided to take a chance.<br />It was the best decision I've made in a while. This movie is spectacular. The script is good, the acting is excellent, and the fight scenes are something to behold. I like to consider myself a sort of action movie connoisseur, and I like to consider this movie as a type of hidden gem. One of those movies that kind of slipped through the cracks because some studio big shot didn't think it was good enough for a theatrical release. In my opinion, Van Damme's acting abilities have improved exponentially in his old age. He has somehow managed to make his wooden and awkward way of acting into something resembling the persona of a troubled and afflicted warrior. The way he talks and the way his eyes look empty are very fitting to his character.<br />The movie clips along at a good pace, and there is hardly any filler. From beginning to end we are treated with a competent (if a bit fantastical) and well-handled plot. The high point of the movie is definitely the Van Damme vs Lundgren face off. That fight scene is particularly brutal. It's also a nice tip-of-the-hat for fans of the first film. Lundgren, by the way, is extra creepy in this movie. His portrayal of Andrew is damn good. It's actually a little unnerving.<br />Something that is worth mentioning is the soundtrack for this movie. It's synthesized, and it's phenomenal. It's really reminiscent of classic 80's action movies. This movie has actually given me hope in Van Damme. I sincerely hope that he can get back to being a big name action star. He may not be the best action hero, but in my opinion, he has the potential to be more entertaining than Stallone or Schwarzenegger.<br />Obviously, I cannot recommend this movie enough.a good pace, and there is hardly any filler.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|So I have played for nearly 2 months and am close to level 50.  here is why I shall play no more.  today I log in to harvest collect and whatever and for like the fifth time every crop business and house's timer is reset to 95hours.  it buggy as hell and it keeps messing up on me.  sometimes I cant even click on things or drag the screen until I log out and back in.  the game itself is fun if a bit tedious but I am not playing anymore unless they fix their problems.  way too buggy.
0385535139|3.0|The Litigators does a great job of reigniting the Grisham fire from early in his career.  Still this is a comedown from the Confession.  The beginning and ending were so trite as to be almost comical.  The story reads well but in the end it doesn't work. I will give him a big pat on the back for not letting the small fry win an obviously flawed case.  But the end was just contrived and equates money with good when the good guys win.<br /><br />Basically read it if you're a Grisham fan but don't knock yourself out over it.
B006P0FD4W|4.0|It must be said that the \\"found footage\\" sub-genre of horror movies requires the audience to suspend disbelief a bit.  The idea is clever - you're watching something that allegedly really happened, which gives the movie a bit of documentary-style credibility.  But you have to accept that at some point in the movie, you're going to shout, \\"put down the darn camera!\\"  It's surprising that the \\"Scream\\" franchise hasn't mocked this trope yet.<br /><br />Either you can get past this, or you can't.  If you can, the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" series should be on your must-see list.  The first two movies tell the present-day stories of Kristi and Katie, two sisters whose pleasantly suburban lifestyles are ripped asunder by a sinister spectral force.  In \\"Paranormal Activity 3,\\" we return to 1988, where the sisters first meet the poltergeist who will terrify them and their families a few years down the road.<br /><br />The movie sets the stage by showing grown-up Kristy and Katie rediscovering old videotapes from when they were children - a gift from recently departed Grandma.  These tapes are later stolen in a scene all too familiar with fans of the first two films.  The movie then switches to the videotapes.<br /><br />Young Katie and Kristi are enjoying Katie's birthday party, and we also meet their mom Julie and her boyfriend Dennis.  (Oddly, there's never any mention of the girls' biological father - where did he go . . . hmmm.)  Dennis, conveniently for the movie's conceit, is a videographer, so naturally his response to every development is his life is to tape it.  During the birthday video, we learn that Kristi has a close relationship with an imaginary friend, Toby.<br /><br />Toby, as you might guess, turns out to be more than imaginary, and he quickly proves to be one scary, demanding guy.  To avoid spoilers, that's it for the plot summary.<br /><br />Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman know how to make a found-footage movie.  Tension builds nicely as we strain towatch a seemingly innocuous scene - are the bedsheets moving?  How about the lamp?  Perhaps the creepiest scenes (before the final 15 minutes, which are terrifying) come with their use of a video camera set up on an oscillating fan base so the camera slowly pans from one part of the house to another - the directors' clever use of the \\"that freaking thing wasn't there a few seconds ago\\" trick will have you looking over your own shoulder the next time you're all alone in the house and hear an unexplained noise.<br /><br />For a third installment in a horror series, \\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" exceeds all expectations.  A spooky film that builds to a truly frightening third act, \\"3\\" succeeds in deepening the story created by the first two installments without wearing out our interest - the filmmakers know that we're here to get scared, not to get a PhD-level understanding of Toby . . . and scare you they do.  Terrific stuff.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Continuing the saga from the first two books, this was a rewarding read.  I enjoyed all the books in the trilogy and am sorry that the author has passed away and there will be no more.
0345803485|1.0|I try to read at least the first 100 pages of every book I pick up before giving up on a story, but by page 113 of Fifty Shades of Grey, my own pain was unbearable. If I had to read \\"I flushed\\" \\"Holy hell\\" or \\"He's so freaking hot\\" again, my brain would explode.<br /><br />Because of the subject matter, I thought the story would be geared for a more mature audience, but given the style of writing, it leans more toward the less sophisticated reader.<br /><br />The author gives new meaning to the term, \\"Show don't tell.\\" Her initial description of the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" was sterile and left no impression this room could/would be a pivotal part of Ana's story. Her style continues in this fashion, leaving the reader with a laundry list of useless descriptions.<br /><br />A good thesaurus would have greatly helped this story too, along with developing the main character into a strong modern day woman, not some Victorian era virgin, who at the age of 21, knows nothing about an orgasm. Maybe than I could have made it passed the first lack-luster love scene to more juicer parts.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|It's true, Meryl Streep gives a brilliant performance in this film.  From all the film footage of Margaret Thatcher that I've seen over the years Ms Streep's depiction of the first and only woman to be Prime Minister of England was dead-on.  Bravo!  However a film is a sum of all its parts, not just one player in it.  If more care had been taken with the story to make it more riveting, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.  Also, the fact that the film is told from the perspective of flashbacks from a senile Margaret Thatcher was almost, in my opinion, unflattering to her.  The film is called The Iron Lady yet they chose to show her at her weakest moments: having hallucinations about her dead husband, Denis.  Denis was charmingly portrayed by Jim Broadbent.  I don't want it to seem as if I'm bashing the entire film because I'm not.  The other actors gave solid performances as well as Ms Streep.  I especially enjoyed seeing Anthony Head in a film again.
1609611543|5.0|I bought and read this book after I was hearing more and more people say that they had developed a wheat allergy.  It helped me understand why that is happening, and I vowed to not become one of them. I loved that the book has so many scholarly journal articles backing up the conclusions.  Without them, I would have been a doubter.<br /><br />I started wheat free cold turkey 9 weeks ago, and I've lost 10.5 lbs while still eating my hard-to-give-up bowl of ice cream at night.  I began reading food labels and was amazed at the things that contained wheat (malted milk balls). But after a few days of craving, I found that the hunger diminished, and I started losing weight.  I felt like taking lunchtime walks.  I did find myself buying a slice of pizza and scraping off the good stuff and throwing away the crust, but that craving also disappeared.<br /><br />Without the crackers and breads and cookies, I needed something to eat, so I'm now spending more time at the vegetable aisle, and we are eating much healthier.  I asked my favorite sandwich shop if they had something without bread, and they accommodated me with barbecue in a container like it was a request that they got everyday.  I found that my favorite bagel sandwich shop has the best salads around.  Those little (albeit more expensive) rice crackers taste great with hummus on them, and are very satisfying.<br /><br />My knees aren't nearly as complaining as they were several weeks ago, so I plan to keep this up even though I approached it as an experiment.  It's gotten to be an easy habit, and it's now easy to eat right.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|After much hesitation, I decided to upgrade from my E7... What a difference!  I had always been a little disappointed in my setup, especially at higher volumes, and the E17 cured it.<br /><br />I compared the E7 to the E17 using Jriver Media Center 16 (in WASAPI output mode) with FLAC files (spanning many genres) and the Klipsch Image X10 headphones.  The E17 has much more separation, greatly improved bass definition, and what I believe to be a smoother treble delivery.  As before, the hardware is top notch.  Unfortunately, Fiio did not include a silicon case as they did with the E7, though the E7 case fits the E17 fairly well.<br /><br />Now if Fiio would just put an SD slot in one of these already!
0470876417|5.0|From start till just about finished, this book is the most innovative literary piece I'v ever encountered.<br /> I believe this book could benefit any student or aspiring learner, whether business student or not.  The books' format creatively engages the reader with the canvas, diagrams, varying fonts and colors, and structure that makes learning the material progressive and fun.  The layout in which the authors presented the information need to be implemented into textbooks of all subjects, because its stimulating and so helpful.<br />  If you a VISUAL Learner, like myself, and you are considering being an entrepreneur, don't be a cheap a*s and buy this book.  Its content is priceless  (like a business model bible).  Perfect for the ADHD type, because it keeps you engaged and excited, not leaving you bored.<br />I really think this book should be read by any young people aspiring to be an entrepreneur, whether in college or not.  Business model generation has been a priceless investment.  Need not comment anymore, just make investment and you'll understand, have fun.

B006PTL1QM|4.0|Immaculately filmed and edited by David Cronenberg, this film was inexplicably ignored at awards time although all three New York Times critics picked it in multiple categories. All five performances are outstanding. Keira Knightly is brave and touching. Michael Fassbinder is perfect as the repressed and conflicted Jung. Viggo Mortensen, playing against type, steals the show as the suave and wary Freud. A film for grown-ups that may well lead them back to reading about these seminal historical figures.

If you expect a well-rounded female character who has actual talents, skills, interests, and opinions (and isn't nice all the time), then avoid.  This is fanfic dressed up nicely.  There's nothing wrong with fanfic sex stories when they're free.<br /><br />I disliked the Twilight Books too, so my tolerance is low for these kinds of stories.

They are in great shape, ripping it up and performing well now that DLR is not completely inebriated. I am looking forward to seeing them again June 2012 but it will be for the original songs, not these.<br /><br />This sounds like old VH but lacks the swank, smart-ass, fun and punch that is their signature, it is well performed but lack-luster.<br /><br />If they had stayed together from the beginning this would have been a FAR better album.

B003TOH8AE|4.0|These days, it feels like you can't go 3 months without a movie based on a comic coming out. Usually they're the superhero kind, and other times you get something completely different like Oldboy or Sin City. I've never been a big fan of the superhero genre of comics or movies, apart from the ones that were meant to be entertaining and no much else. Kick-Ass didn't seem very interesting when I saw the trailer for it, and I hadn't read the comic either. I just watched the movie last night, and I think I'll be ordering the comic pretty soon because the movie sure won me over. Kick-Ass has just about everything I want in a good movie, and while there were two things toward the end that killed the moment for me, I have to say that it's one of the better movies I've seen this year.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is your average high school geek. He has no luck with the ladies, fantasizes about his [totally stacked] teacher Mrs. Zane, isn't even the funny one in his small group of friends, and spends most of his time at the comic shop or online. To make matters worse, he's constantly being robbed by two hoodlums in the neighborhood. During one robbing session, he notices someone observing the situation from their window. Rather than come down and help or call the police, the person does nothing, and this irritates Dave to the point of wanting to make a difference. He orders a scuba diver suit that looks kinda superhero-y, gets a baton for a weapon, and makes it his goal to become a local superhero: Kick-Ass. And wouldn't you know it, he just so happens to encounter the hoodlums pretty soon after getting his outfit. Things...don't go as well as he'd like, though he was off to a great start, and Dave gets stabbed AND run over, accidentally, by someone else who just drives off without helping him. The poor kid ends up in the hospital and comes out with messed up nerve endings and some enhanced bones. Rather than give up, he continues with the Kick-Ass thing and when he finally manages to bring justice to someone being beat up by 3 big dudes, it gets recorded and goes up on the internet, making him an instant star. But at the same time, there's a rumor going around of someone who looks like Batman...or just a superhero...messing up a local mob kingpin's business. Yep, Kick-Ass is in over his head, and it's going to take some people with much better training than him to set things right.<br /><br />I was impressed by how well comedy, drama and action were all mixed together in Kick-Ass. The first quarter of the movie is comical, the middle is action-packed, and the final part has a lot of action with drama while still knowing when to throw in some humor. And my god was I happy to see that they had him fighting like someone who didn't know what they were doing and just brawling to their heart's content. I hate fights in movies that -look- like choreographed fights (think Tron Legacy's god-awful bar/club fight), but nearly everything here looked good. Even more amazing was Nicholas Cage giving a performance that wasn't bad. In fact, this could be the best thing I've seen him do in years. He does a terrific job as the Big Daddy character: a nice blend of loving father and revenge-driven psycho. Who knew? But, I have to agree with the majority here, when I say that the real winner of the movie is Hit-Girl. A little girl who isn't even a tween, cussing up a storm and literally shredding bad guys to bits with double bladed staffs, knives and more. Somehow, her character fits into the world of Kick-Ass, which sounds silly on paper but when you see it for yourself, it works. Had the movie been just about Kick-Ass himself, it probably would've gotten stale with the whole awkward superhero thing. Leave it to Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to keep things moving along just nicely. There isn't much else I can rave about without ruining some plot points. The cast and acting is solid all-around, even from Mark Strong and Mr. McLovin.<br /><br />It's too bad that thefinal act is, in my eyes, underwhelming thanks to the big reveal of something Big Daddy and Hit-Girl order. Not that what I was expecting was much better, but when it's showtime, my shoulders drooped and I was let down severely. The climax is ruined even more by the use of a weapon. I won't say what, but when it's used, man...had that happened earlier on, I might have just turned the movie off because it was such an easy way to end things. So much for a big finish. And yes, I know this is a comic book movie, so it might've worked better in the comic, but on the big screen it looks goofy. Sorry.<br /><br />Despite the below average climax, I had a good time watching it, and will be buying it sometime in the future. Kick-Ass deserves the money it earned in theaters (nearly 100m worldwide), and earns the R rating it has. How often do you see an action movie that could've been PG-13 if not for a few profanities? If you're sick of Spider-Man or like your heroes a little more realistic, go with Kick-Ass.<br /><br />Once again, big props to Mrs. Zane.

B000O176Q6|4.0|Bruce Lee...Enter the Dragon...a great movie, and on blu ray, the colors are brilliant and the picture is sharp, a improvement from the dvd I have....but...there is one problem, the blu-ray doesn't last as long as the dvd. I had the DVD when it first released, about 15 years ago. I purchased the blu-ray just 4 years ago and it has already gone bad, the picture freezes and skips more often than I like to count. There were no marks on the disc of any kind; I have always taken good care of both the dvd and blu-ray. Sadly, the DVD out lasted the blu-ray. I do not plan to buy another, since the price is still too high, although Amazon will always offer great prices, it's just that I believe in about 3 or 4 years I would have to buy another blu ray. Beware, not all blu-rays last as long as they say, My DVD of \\"Enter the Dragon\\" still works great. I have decided to stop buying blu-ray, it's just too expensive and it doesn't last. I expected it last a long time, as they have advertised many times that blu-ray will out last DVD. Sadly it doesn't. I hope this will help people decide from Blu-ray and DVD. I'm sticking to DVD.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Let me first say that I read all 3 books within 4 days in the time I had between work and school. I could not put them down willingly!<br /><br />The first book (Hunger Games) is my favorite of the 3. The story is really gripping and you get really invested in the characters and their survival. There's a lot of shocking moments to keep you interested and the entire part of the storyline taking place in the Hunger Games arena is very action-packed. It also started a sort of love triangle involving the main character (Katniss), her friend (Gale), and one of her fellow Hunger Games competitors (Peeta).<br /><br />The second book (Catching Fire) is pretty good as well. There are quite a few twists and many new, likable characters are introduced. The shocking end of the first book is the entire storyline for this one. I don't feel like it was as exciting and catchy as the first, but I still loved it.<br /><br />The third book (Mockingjay)is my least favorite. Not because of the quality of the writing (very good), but because I didn't care for the direction the writer took the story. It wasn't what I would've done, but hey, I'm not a writer. Nevertheless, I still could not put it down for a second. The story gets really crazy in this book and Katniss has to take on a new role in her life. The book is a finale to the part of the story involving the oppression of the outer cities by the main city. For Katniss, the love triangle finally breaks and a choice is made.<br /><br />This trilogy is definitely worth reading if you enjoy action and a well-written story. If you watched the movie without reading the book, I'll say it did not do this book justice. And, not gonna lie, you might just feel legitimate joy, anger, or sadness while reading (maybe shed a tear or two haha).
B003OCWF6I|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies!  The action is good, the story line is good, there is a good amount of comedy, good music, and great acting!  I thoroughly hope that there will be a sequel....

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|One of the best uses of 3D technology is in this movie, the story is pretty good too. This is one of few movies which actually make things jump out of the screen and its kid friendly. I reconmend this if you are looking to add a 3D movie to your collection. I would not have purchased this if it was 2d only.

B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Well, I am probably one of a very small group of people who is just now getting into the Harry Potter series of books and/or films.  I chose to forgo the reading of the books and simply order and watch every one of the Harry Potter movies from the very first one to the final, Deathly Hallows Part 2.  Being an older adult, I was surprised how much I enjoyed these movies.  The special effects and characters were unbelievable.  Again, having the ability to watch these Videos on Demand from Amazon at the simple touch of a finger is wonderful!
0545265355|5.0|Great boxed set, good value for money. Fast delivery and item as described. My daughter couldnt wait for these to arrive and she has not been disappointed, far better than the movie in her opinion.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|My husband (that is not a fan of romantic movies, I think he actually likes only \\"As Good as it Gets\\" and \\"Something's Gotta Give\\") and I watched this film on the theater last year and LOVED it. So two days ago coming back from work I heard the song \\"I had the Time of my life\\" somewhere and the first thing that came to my mind was that perfect scene of Emma and Ryan in this movie. I don't buy DVD's much but I needed to have that Dirty Dancing scene from \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" with me forever. So we bought the DVD and enjoyed the movie one more time, it has so many funny and original lines!!!. And yes, as everybody has been saying, Ryan Gosling can not go wrong. I knew Emma, Steve, Julianne, Marissa and Kevin were funny, but after watching Ryan Gosling in \\"Blue Valentine\\" (he was great but his caracter is so depressing) I never thought he could make me laugh. Emma and Ryan should make many more movies together (I know they are making \\"The Gangster Squad\\"), they are perfection.
1423136802|5.0|A Fantastic boxed set, fast delivery, highly recommend to others. Item was as described. My 12 year old son loved these books.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|When I heard about this movie, it wasn't from any Hollywood report, it was from an online artical about the best movies that didn't make it to the American Academy Awards. Truly sad considering how much acting potential there is in this movie, mostly consistent of kids and teens who show the potential to become great actors. Not to mention the one and only Nick Frost (wait, wait, with long hair? That's different) who goes on the sideline to let newcomers have a shot at shining. And shine they definitely do.<br />A gang of English teens attack and rob a young woman and, in the process, witness something ruin a car a few yards away from them. That something turning out to be an alien, and not a friendly one in the slightest. But not entirely the most formidable, either. After ridding it, there comes a mini-invasion of more creatures. Unlike the first, these have pitch dark fur and glow-in-the-dark fangs and get described as \\"werewolf chimpanzee\\" kind of monsters. Only not everyone believes they're aliens, which adds to the crazy brand of humor only the English can truly do effectively.<br />A gang of teens, a young woman who's graduated a nurse, a couple potheads, not to mention a hardcore gangster who's rather opinionated, but nonetheless, all the ingredients add up to very crazy good sci-fi/comedy flick.<br />I do hope there will be future movies including any (maybe all?) of the young actors, that's how good at acting they are. Their debut turns out to be VERY strong.

Cline narrative has a good flow, and with all the pop culture in the book, is hard not to like, if you're into any of the 80's pop culture.<br />An amazing and light read, for everyone.<br /><br />Oh, and I bought kindle edition, nice and numbered.

B005LAII0I|4.0|Although not exactly a masterpiece, this film is a very pleasant, very amusing and very nice moment of cinema. It doesn't pretend to have other ambitions than to give us a merry good laugh - but in this mission it succeeds very nicely.<br /><br />This is a very unorthodox retelling of the Snow White fairy tale, but the principal characters are all there.<br /><br />The Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) is probably the main attraction in this show. She was \\"modernized\\" (she is in fact a gold digger exhausting financial resources of successive husbands) and \\"upgraded\\" (she can do REALLY BAD magic - it is not just disguise and poison). Her Magic Mirror is also much more powerful than earlier versions. Julia Roberts clearly had lots of fun playing this character and she is simply excellent! She is also very atractive in this film - frankly, I think even more attractive than Snow White... And the scene in which she takes care her of her body, face, skin, lips, hair etc. to better ensnare the Prince Charming is worth an Oscar!<br /><br />Snow White (Lilly Collins) is of course also more \\"modern\\" than the one in Disney classical movie, but she is definitely not a modern teenager. She is brave, clever, funny and has much more ambition than just being rescued by the Prince Charming, but she is also a true lady: she is always impeccably dressed, never raises her voice, never curses, is always polite (even to the enemies) and although she can swordfight if necessary, she has also all the charm (and timidity) of a very young girl who was never allowed much out of her house... Last but not least, she is clearly a real future queen material - because with all her charm, manners and timidity she can also be ruthless, when necessary...<br /><br />The Prince Charming (Armie Hammer) is a handsome young man, a little bit arrogant and conceited in the beginning, but also courageous, clever, resourceful and ultimately rather likeable. He can also quite well spank young ladies with his sword...)))<br /><br />The Seven Dwarves are a very special bunch and I will not say much more about them, to avoid spoilers. But they certainly give a great show! After the end, just before the credits we learn what happened to them later - do NOT miss that part!<br /><br />This film has a lot of easy and pleasant humour, with the results of magic used by the Evil Queen (magic is always a little unpredictable) and her comments on the developing story being the best moments. A good advice - never get changed into a cockroach. And if it happens, beware of grasshoppers...))) Also, before serving somebody a magic elixir, check well the notice...<br /><br />Towards the end of the film Sean Bean drops by just in time to conclude the film and give away Snow White in marriage and he is a very impressive presence. And no, just for once, his character doesn't get killed in this one...)))<br /><br />All in all, this is a very amusing, nice little film, watchable by all family, with two very beautiful women, one very handsome young man and seven very amusing unusually short freedom fighters! Enjoy!)))<br /><br />The Seven Dwarves are a very special bunch and I will not say much more about them, to avoid spoilers. But they certainly give a great show!

B00338QENI|4.0|The book gives the reader good insight into the medical world of tissue donation.<br />It proves that we (rich or poor), ultimately do not have control over our own bodies once<br />the medical field removes tissue.<br />The Lacks family portrait is a sad but truthful story of how one event can have a positive or<br />negative impact on family generations.<br />Very good read.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|This film has for only purpose to entertain us and in this aspect it is highly succesful. The main hero is very likeable, the leading girl charming, the display of military hardware impressive, the aliens naughty (and ugly and stupid!), the scenario doesn't make much sense, the CGI effects are EXCELLENT, US Navy is the best, US government is incompetent - in one word, everything is as it should be in a movie made to go nicely with your popcorn on a Friday evening. WARNING! Some SPOILERS incoming at six o'clock!<br /><br />The main hero, Lt. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a troubled young man who after messing up a lot in his early life finally joined the US Navy and by some extraordinary miracle managed to become an officer in charge of weapons on board of USS \\"John Paul Jones\\", a very powerful destroyer of \\"Arleigh Burke\\" class. He is however poorly noted by his superiors and is generally considered as a disappointment and a failure. The unexpected alien invasion during a naval exercice will suddenly force him to take command (\\"Who is in charge now?\\" \\"Hopper!\\" \\"We are so dead!\\") and lead his men into a particularly deadly fight against a vicious and resourceful enemy.<br /><br />Other than his messy life style Alex Hooper has also another \\"problem\\" - his gorgeous, sculpturally beautiful girlfriend Samantha (Brooklyn Decker). She loves him, he loves her and they are engaged to be married - but her father hates his guts and for reasons which you will have to discover yourself his agreement to their marriage actually matters...<br /><br />Other characters are also important: Alex's brother, Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard) who is the older, responsible and organised version of Alex; Vice-Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), tough, impressive commander in chief of US Pacific Fleet; Japanese Navy Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano), commanding the Japanese destroyer \\"Myoko\\" and Lt. Colonel (Retired) Mick Canales (Gregory D. Gadson), a bitter US Army veteran who lost his both legs in one of recent American wars.<br /><br />Rihanna makes her movie debut in this film, as Petty Officer Cora Raikes, a weapon specialist and crew member on board of USS \\"John Paul Jones\\", serving under Alex Hopper orders. She has a lot of screen time and she is VERY good! I was very pleasantly surprised by her acting and I am looking forward to see her in more films.<br /><br />The display of modern weaponry is very impressive. 5-inch guns and 20mm Phalanx CIWS (Close-in Weapon System), \\"Harpoon\\" missiles and 324 mm torpedoes of American and Japanese destroyers are used generously and they give a great show. And once the old battleship USS \\"Missouri\\" enters in action with her 16-inch big guns, things get even better!<br /><br />The aliens are very very agressive and naughty - although to be fair, they seem to avoid the colateral damage as much as possible, by sparing the obviously harmless oponents. They also try to rescue their own soldiers taken prisoner, which is something not so frequent in SF films. Other than that they are the \\"standard issue\\" aliens: ugly, hostile, technologically advanced in some fields but limited in others (they do not seem to grasp fully the concept of guided weapons) and last but not least abysmally, galactically, terminally stupid! BUT, in this film it actually is an asset, because it allows USS \\"Missouri\\" to engage the alien flagship in a way which reminds of the bloody and dramatic fight between HMS \\"Victory\\" and \\"Redoutable\\" at Trafalgar...<br /><br />The scenario doesn't make much sense as for the reasons for this invasion which seems ultimately to be just a reconnaissance. The reason for the attack on Oahu island and the whole battle around it are even more ludicrous - as for the whole \\"saving the world\\" thing, let's just throw a veil of silence on it... A civilization able to send a scouting military expedition of five ships through interstellar space, can always send a second one, stronger and better prepared. So, there is a possibility of a sequel.<br /><br />The CGI effects are really EXCELLENT! Alien ships and weapons are very well done, fights are very \\"realistic\\" and visually the film is a big success.<br /><br />All fighting men and women of US forces (and the one lonely Japanese guy) are shown as heroes fighting to the end at the best of their capacities, engaging enemy with missiles first, handguns second and iron bars and bare fists after that, if necessary. In contrast, the US government is (of course!) completely incompetent, which is only normal, considering that it is chaired by a Secretary of Defense played by Peter MacNicol (yes, you read well!).<br /><br />So, all in all, it is a rather succesful, quite entertaining film, with lots of good special effects, lots of good fights, two well playing hot chicks (Brooklyn Decker and Rihanna), some handsome men, a very stupid scenario, quite a lot of humour, at least one very touching moment and one very VERY dearly paid chicken burito...))) I had lots of fun watching it, although I am aware of its weaknesses - and I think that if all you need is some harmless entertainment, you will like it too. Enjoy!ssibility of a sequel.<br /><br />The CGI effects are really EXCELLENT!

B007WZ7ILK|5.0|Really liking the new song. Just when u thought the last chapter of the California Saga known as The Beach Boys had already been written BAM! you're hit with da newz of the reunion.Brian Wilson's knack for great melodies is still intact. Although I do hear echoes of prior compositional triumphs in the new song. Echoes of \\"Your Summer Dream\\" and \\"Keep an Eye on Summer\\" come to mind~Brian has always been a master of reworking some previously utilized melodies. Jeffrey Foskett's vocals are all over this(that's not a bad thing) The Boys once again revisit the theme of the power of music, as they did in 1970 with \\"Add Some Music To Your Day\\". \\"That's Why God\\" is the \\"Add Some Music\\" of the 2000's. It is a re-affirmation that the Brian and the Boys still believe in the power of music. Sure hope the new album is as good as this song! By the way, just purchased the vinyl version of this modern masterpiece on vinyl. This is a sick-ass album! enjoy!

1594203334|1.0|I was so excited to read this book when I saw it at Barnes and Noble. What a refreshing change to read about  different cultures parenting styles and child rearing ideas.<br />I ordered it and  found this book to be really insulting. At several points while reading it I commented out loud my disgust. The authors views, and what she claims are most French womens views, about the worth of a stay at home mom are so degrading and sad. I hope that her words  are mostly the authors personal opinion and not the ideas of an entire culture.<br />Do not waste your money on this book.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Oh yes, another sick wife/dog/_____ (fill in the blank) then you find out there is an infidelity....  And we have to care about these people because well they are rich but nice rich and not spoiled and repulsive with on cue cry scenes and everyone is so ...  so... canned.  Cue fake emotional scene.<br /><br />Lard on the music.<br /><br />Oh and it's original because it's quirky Hawaii.  I'm a fan of Clooney but I didn't believe his character was real for one minute.  With the way the snotty kids talk to him and he doesn't claim to have any experience in raising kids...  he just lets them talk crap to him without raising an eyebrow  (yeah right).  really one snotty character after another and Clooney is so ... unbelievable.  So is the script.<br /><br />About the only thing that part of the movie got right is the overwhelming stupidity of much of today's movie kids.  It makes you wish for the collapse of Western Civilization.  So far movie kids are the nadir.

B007AMMHSY|5.0|I'm not a movie critic by any means and have never written a review but I will say, The Skin I Live In is the best movie I have ever seen. It's one of those few that stick with you and I found myself thinking about it for several days. Don't let the sub-titles stop you from watching it - it actually makes the movie better. I think it's best not to read too much about the movie before watching it and make sure you set aside 2 hours to focus on nothing else.
B000UJ48VI|3.0|LOLITA is one of those films I had heard about for years and finally I had the chance to watch this disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a very disturbing tale about a middle-aged professor, played by the fine James Mason, whose life is obsessed by the teenage Lolita, played remarkably by Sue Lyon. Shelley Winter's is the mother of the troubled Lolita. To top of the cast, add in Peter Sellers as the creepiest of them all. As in DR. STRANGELOVE, Sellers gets to play several characters.<br />I wondered how the story of LOLITA would have been tackled in 1962. There are suggestions and innuendo of an attraction between the professor and Lolita and soon it becomes clear what is actually happening in their relationship. No doubt this created a sensation in its day since Sue Lyon was only 14 or 15 during the filming. It's a very disturbing film about several very troubled individuals. Lolita is much wiser in all matters--more so than a woman 3 times her age. She is no innocent and she willingly plays into the hands of men old enough to be her father.<br />The story is long and drawn out. LOLITA clocks in at over 2 1/2 hours and it seems to drag on. Maybe the unnverving aspect of the storyline makes it harder to digest. The film starts with a killing that seems without reason. The story then goes back in time to give us the set-up. This may be a Kubrick masterpiece but beware the subject matter is hard to accept.<br />I was disappointed that there were no extras of substance with the film. There was the theatrical trailer whose message was \\"How could they make a movie about LOLITA?\\" Again, this must have been totally shocking in the early 1960's as it still is today.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love the CD!!!  Since I hadn't heard any other songs by them, was leary to buy it but it's worth the listen!!  Their video is strange but the song \\"Free\\" is great.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I've never read a book quite like this one. The author's descriptive powers are impressive, and her grasp of the world through the protagonist's eyes even more so.
0441013597|4.0|I've been meaning to read Frank Herbert's Dune for years now because I love sci-fi/fantasy and because I feel it's important to understand how a genre will forever be influenced by one of its signature works. The world of Dune (both the planet and the larger fictional universe) is notable for its rich detail of culture, history and mythology. Herbert probably borrowed from Tolkein when he added the supplementary glossary and appendix, which I flipped to as often as I encountered a strange word or custom.<br /><br />Dune was first published in 1965 and while many of its themes endure to this day, I believe the story says so much more about the decade in which it was written. Environmentalism was gaining momentum as new movement. The hugely popular Lawrence of Arabia film was released just three years prior. The myth of the messianic off-worlder redeeming a tribal culture might seem overdone in today's fantasy novels, but that's because Dune and its contemporaries told that story so well.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|The Human Stain is a beautifully haunting film, well cast and directed. I'm not sure that the brief female nudity was necessary, but the pacing, the cinematography, and wonderful performances by the always amazing Hopkins, the increasingly deep Kidman, and the ever competent Sinise and Harris make for a film that is complex, suspenseful, and affecting.  The musical score captures the emotion of the film perfectly.
B001HLZMUE|3.0|Everything went great untill I tried to download the movie and now I find out I can't download to my computer, so, if I want to watch this movie, I have to be online, of course, I am not a very computer savvy type person so, there is a possibilaty that I did something wrong but, don't think so.<br />  Now as far as the movie went , it was great, quality was great.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Very Good, Read all three books in a week. Did not want to put it down. A lot of reviews say that this is written to a younger demographic, but I'm in my fifties and really enjoyed all three books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Everytime I bring my actual Bible with me it always gets torn somehow. Now I don't have to bring it with me everywhere because I have this on the go. Very useful :-)

B004GJYROG|5.0|I bought this for my... get this... 18 year old son. He loved it when he was young and still does! It's a nostalgic thing. He has always loved Looney Tunes and still does (he LOVES Pepe' Le Pew.) I like the Looney's myself. Brings back memories of watchin them in the 60's & 70's. Not even about the basketball just the fact that the Looney Tunes are in it (and Pepe' Le Pew) is why he loves it.<br /><br />But anyway.. I wouldn't say that this is JUST for little kids. If your a fan of the Looneys or a fan of Michael Jordan... Your sure to like this movie! Now this is NOT a GREAT \\"GROUNDBREAKING\\" movie in anyway. But I don't think it was suppose to be. It's just fun & silly. It has humor for the little ones but also stuff that adults can understand. And it defiantly blows Mary Poppins out of the water! (Not that they have anything in common) just a reference since they're both live CG animation movies.<br /><br />All in all if I could give it 6 stars I would! Anyone who gave this movie a rating of 2 stars or under are stupid! They can't understand good old fashion fun, with some good old fashion Looney Tunes humor! And it has Bill Murray in it. So you cant go wrong there.<br /><br />GREAT - FUN MOVIE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book, and the whole trilogy, was amazing!  I couldn't put the books down!  I hate reading and I finished the books within 3 weeks, with working full time and going to school.  I want to reread the books once I'm done with finals!  I don't think these books can be topped!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've tried many different types of earphones and headphones but keep coming back to these. Not only are they incredibly affordable, but they also sound great. I have small ears - the Apple earphones hurt the inside of my hear - so I've tried a bunch of different ones. Some are too big, some are flimsy and you have to keep readjusting. But these headphones are perfect. I would recommend for anyone with small ears. :)
B0079R8IYW|2.0|The case is fairly light weight, although it does had weight and bulk to the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The case will only allow the Fire to stand in landscape mode.  It will also allow it to tilt at an angle for typing; however, only in one direction.  I have some apps which open only in one direction and it's the opposite direction of the tilt, so it can only be used on some, not all, websites and apps.<br /><br />In some apps in order to exit you must press the bar at the bottom, but the case covers the bar so you must pull the case away and press your finger or stylus inside.  Quite awkward.<br /><br />This case is so awkward, in fact, that I don't intend to keep my Fire in it.  I will only use it when I want to watch a video and need a stand.<br /><br />It has slots inside the cover to hold credit cards, but I would advise against that.  A lot of tablets are left on tables and in airplane pockets, so you wouldn't want to leave your credit or debit cards along with it.  You can slip paper notes into the sleeve inside the front pocket.  Although I don't know who's going to be writing notes when they have a tablet handy.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see is an elastic band inside the cover to hold a stylus, instead of credit card slots.<br /><br />In short, the designers could have done a much better job with this cover.  Some simple adjustments would have made it worth purchasing.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|Tried with both an iPad 3 (new iPad) and original iPad to connect to receiver inputs. Could hear the audio, but could not see the video. Why pay more for a genuine Apple product if it's not going to work? Returning this to try a cheaper, better reviewed brand.
0307949508|4.0|Another tasty whodunnit gem! Loved it and enjoyed the process of Lisbeth maturing into a new level of self. Just HAVE to read the final book now!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|this book was amazing i could not put it down. i did not want it to end. while i was reading this book i found myself comparing abby and travis's relationship with my own. and i have come to relize that travis resembles my boyfriend more than i thought. never the less this book is a must read!
0439023491|4.0|My book arrived damaged from the sellar..but I could not stop reading it. Katniss Everdeen is a new folk hero to me. The page turning, first person style kept me in the story even when I did not want to be. I had to get Book 3, to find out how everything gets straighented out!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can enjoy reading the Bible so much better. And it seems to come to life. It also helps me with words I can't pronounce. This app is just awesome to me.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a really fun and addictive game. plays a lot like farmville but is better if you ask me. the only thing I don't like is that it takes so long for energy to rebuild. others than that it is a lot of fun. worth the download for sure.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|As has been reported many times before, this movie focused way too much on Margaret Thatcher's dementia. Regardless of how one might feel about Margaret Thatcher politically, she was coherent for most if not all of the time she was in office. All that said, Meryl Streep's portrayal was truly stellar and worthy of award! We rented this movie via Amazon ($2.00 cheaper than iTunes!) and I'm glad we did, as this is not the kind of movie I would ever want to see again. All in all, an unsatisfying piece of entertainment.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into when I decided to read E.L. James Fifty Shades of Grey, what I found was that it surprised me in the best way possible. The characters really came alive with how naturally they were written. I loved Ana's clumsiness and sharp wit, but her internalising is what really provided the comedy of the novel. Through her first person point of view, one can easily fall for the dark sensuality of Mr. Christian Grey right along with her, and of course, who cannot mention that E.L. James' incorporation of the kinky makes Christian all the more of a forbidden fruit. Ana and Christian are compared to the ruin and redemption of Hardy's Tess of the D'urbervilles and while that can hold true, the real ruin and redemption isn't Ana's, but Mr. Grey's. In that aspect, the novel reminded me of another great ebook that I read just before it, Robert Avon's dark comedy The Seducer's Diary, where the seducer may just become the seduced. Although somewhat different, romance and psychology are mixed in The Seducer's Diary too. Fifty Shades really hits women on the mark, as it gives the pleasure and pain of falling in love, while giving 'sexy' a new twist.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|With his latest book Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman boldly claims that the American economy is in a depression, not a recession and that, despite protestations from politicians and fellow economists, we have the power to end this depression, but we lack the political leadership to do so.  The first portion of Krugman's argument is provocative enough and certainly spurs disputation with his fellow macroeconomists.  Some, like Krugman, agree that we've been in a prolonged recession since 2008 with brief periods of recovery followed by relapses.  By now most everyone knows what brought on our current economic malaise: consumers became over-leveraged with debt, our government ran massive deficits, and a housing bubble was allowed to develop unchecked and subsequently burst.  When the housing market crashed and we all realized how overextended we all were the economy went into an intense period of retrenchment from which we have not yet recovered.  Krugman offers up a summary of the crisis in a way that lay people can understand.  Macroeconomics may be boring to some, but it's not impenetrable, and Krugman walks readers through it all with concise easy to follow prose.  The parallels to the Great Depression are a bit ominous to say the least, especially if you've studied that period of our history.  The economists and the public of that era scarcely understood what was occurring and were uncertain how to progress.  Much like our current era there were points where the economy seemed to recover.  Certainly not everyone was unemployed and economic activity continued on at varying levels, just as now.  And that's the scary part, the parallels between the Great Depression and now that Krugman lays out.  The three legs of the economy, spending by consumers, businesses, and government, all gave out at roughly the same time.  An admitted Keynesian economist, Krugman argues that government must step in to prop up the economy, even if we are carrying a burdensome debt load, and that this stimulus can only be provided so long as the economy is sluggish and until consumer and business spending recovers.<br /><br />Krugman's invocation of Keynesian economic policy is likely to be the most controversial argument as macroeconomists remain divided on the wisdom of Keynesian economic policy.  The massive debt racked up by the U.S. government over the past decade makes arguing for increased deficit spending a hard case to advocate for.  The rise of the Tea Party and deficit hawks complicates things further.  The polarization of our two party system and an unwillingness to find common cause further poisons the atmosphere.  Complicating things further is the general publics and politicians general and seemingly willful ignorance of the principles of macroeconomics renders them unable to comprehend what is happening and how to respond; a situation which again mirrors the 1930s.  What is truly frightening is that political leaders from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Bernanke (a scholar on the Great Depression for heaven's sake!), to the President, to members of Congress don't seem to be able to grasp even the basics of macroeconomics and how to respond to a crisis, a theme addressed quite in Robert Draper's [[ASIN:1451642083 Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives]], which I recommend and read while reading this book.  The forced austerity of Greece, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland should all point to the danger of cutting off government spending at a time when consumer and business spending have been deeply entrenched, and yet we are failing to head the warning signs.  The United Kingdom's recent slide into yet another recession should be the warning sign for deficit hawks that now is not the time to cut government spending, but again that is an oversimplification.  The United Kingdom has a harder time offering treasury bonds and notes in the global market, something the United States is not hamperedby.  The question is how long will that last?<br /><br />Krugman makes points that are by turns frightening, accurate, and frustrating.  Pointing out the similarities to the Great Depression is a bit frightening as we linger in the fourth year of our current economic malaise.  Some may argue that hypothesis as there are certainly bright spots to our economy, but if you were to read the newspapers and histories of the 1930s you'd see the same thing occurring then.  It's clear that now as then we're fumbling our way through a crisis with halfhearted measures, avoiding some of the clear mistakes of the 1930s but sadly repeating others.  Readers may agree or disagree with Krugman, but at least he's consistent in his beliefs and able to articulate them in a way that is approachable and understandable.  Clearly Krugman is pitching this idea with an eye on the 2012 elections.  Whether his ideas resonate with voters and more importantly politicians remains to be seen.  I cannot help of the Rooseveltian idea of at least trying SOMETHING to end our malaise.by.

1439170916|5.0|This is truly a remarkable work. It is both literary and scientifically, clinically precise. For a lay person the clinical progress is explained so well that a lack of training in micro-biology or the many other disciplines that are necessarily referred to in relating the history of cancer treatment is no handicap to understanding the long slow march of unraveling both the causes of and the evolution of the treatments for cancer. The story is also a story of personalities. Many incredible individuals who contributed to the progression outlined in these pages, Scientists, Physicians, Fund Raisers, Politicians and of course- the patients.<br /><br />I don't typically read science oriented books. My taste is more tilted toward literature and fiction. This was recommended to me by a physician colleague. With some trepidation I ordered it and I was immediately swept up in the scope and drama of what is truly one of the great scientific achievements of the century even with much left to be done. The writer deserves the accolades he has received for making this material come to life in a way that is accessible to a general readership. A really stunning and enlightening read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is my fav app EVER!!!!!! Ive been waiting for this for so long. The only improvement would be to add notifications. It says they don't work on the kindle fire.
1451627289|5.0|My husband and I both listened to the unabridged audio book version and both loved it. The narrator did a wonderful job. What a great book! And what a great story! One that I will revisit someday. I will keep my review short and sweet since so much has already been said about 11/22/63. This is only my second Stephen King's book since I read the wonderful \\"The Green Mile\\". I greatly admired the transition from current time to past time, I felt that I lived through the late 50s and early 60s through King's acute observation and description. Not since Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" have I enjoyed a time travelling novel as much. Highly recommended.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I call movies like this empty action.  You never know exactly why they're doing what there doing, how they escape unscathed again and again or who the characters really are.  When there's no character development you don't care what they're doing because you don't know them well enough.  Compare this to the tv series Lost.  Lost had even more insane unexplained situations arise but it worked because you knew the characters so well you CARED about what happened to them.  You put up with zany stuff because the characters were so real.  In this mish-mash movie the're just going through the motions.  At the end, almost as an insult we find out Ethans's cohort was supposed to protect his wife when she was killed....but wait, a cameo from Katie Holmes shows she's not really dead!  They wave at each other and all is well.  2 hours of action and 5 min of character development at the end...seriously?...that's it?  It was an ending of a story that didn't exist for most of the movie.  Sorry guys, bad movie.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Proving that bargains *can* still be found in the digital books sector despite price collusion allegations agains the Big 6 and Apple, this Omnibus edition of Wool is currently selling on Amazon for the measly price of 4.99. This novel (which is a collection of 5 installments - almost like chapbooks from ye olden days) clocks in at a whopping 550 pages, but quality was not sacrificed for quantity, and Howey proves that despite the pounds of dregs found upon the self-publishing mire that is the Amazon Kindle store there are still gems to be found by authors that show a lot of promise.<br /><br />Despite the fact that all 5 of these installments are available individually for .99  to 2.99 each (depending on the length of the chapter), I'll be reviewing the omnibus edition because honestly I think that if you are going to start reading this series you'll want to buy the whole thing, it's really worth it.<br /><br />The first installment is obviously a short story - a good one, but a short story nonetheless, which opens the scene for the reader of where the story takes place - a post apocalyptic world, destroyed and ravaged beyond belief, where people live in Silos that span hundreds of levels underground. Those that transgress against the laws of the silos, that go stir crazy and wish to escape, are sent out for the 'cleaning', a veritable death sentence where they sacrifice themselves for the good of the thousands that remain, leaving the safe confines of the Silo in a badly created hazmat suit to 'clean' the cameras that allow for the only views of the outside world available.<br /><br />There are some pacing issues in the first few installments which I felt were due to the episodic nature that the author chose for his tale - Wool 2, for instance, was a bit of a slog to get through. However, I did feel that the choices were understandable and perhaps even a self-aware choice to make the reader feel the same way as the protagonists as they make they way through hundreds of levels of stairs.<br /><br />By the time you reach Wool 4 and 5 - which are the longest of the chapter installments - all pacing issues are long gone and the reader is in for a wild ride as pieces fall into place and all the story building reaches their inevitable conclusions.<br /><br />I enjoyed this post apocalyptic world that Howey created, and readers who also enjoy video games will no doubt be reminded of the Fallout series. Howey obviously put in a lot of time and effort to creating the world of the Silo, with its multitudinous levels, each one an entity on its own with a specific purpose to the greater good, from nurseries to machinery, and the all powerful 'IT department'.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more stories set in this world and finding out more about what caused the disasters to happen. I think it was a bold and wise choice for Howey to hold back some of the mysteries and not reveal all too quickly. I was definitely impressed by this effort by a self-published author and I'm sure I'll be checking out more of his workds in the future.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I first heard \\"The Walk\\" on KINK-FM in Portland, Oregon and was hooked.  Now, I even have a Mayer Hawthorne station on Pandora.  Problem is they don't play it often enough so I bought the CD.  I'm over 60 and I still love to dance.
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and I still can't get over how frighteningly realistic it is.  The author's use of just the right amount of subtlety at describing the horror of children fighting to the death speaks volumes of her talent.  I never found the books to be over the top or too far out of the range of possibility as to be unbelievable.  The characters are likeable and relatable.  The book is very well-written and in spite of and also because of the plot, highly compelling.  And thankfully, as the first book in the series, you will not be sorry you entered the world of Panem.
B002QS1O36|5.0|Terrific film!  Memorializes a blockbuster musical seen by millions on stage.  Perfect job of converting to film a legend.  I was disappointed that I could not play it in Vietnam due to licensing restrictions.
B000002UDD|5.0|the best release from the best thrash metal group ever!!! I've loved every thing megadeth has ever made but so far, so good, so what!! is my all time favorite by megadeth. From track 1 to track 9 is amazing, a must have for any megadeth fan.
0060872675|1.0|Bugger, I should have read the reviews. I thought it was the Where's my Cow book that Vimes reads to his son but nooooo.... I wouldn't have minded that if the illustrations weren't so bad. Not gross as someone else said but just bad art. Poorly done in photoshop or something.

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I have to say first that I LOVE movies about ghosts and hauntings and have seen as many as I could find. The fact that this movie is set in the early 1900s (I believe- don't quote me on that) gives it an old fashioned kind of spookiness that really added to the film. I thought the pop-out scares were decent but the storyline is what I thought made the movie superb. I'd recommend it to anyone, including those that shy away from horror movies, because it's unlike any I've seen- no gore, no dumb teenagers, no cheap scares, etc. Must-see.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved it. I see other people had problems with it but you just got to be smarter than the average bear.

B0051HNMTI|5.0|this is an amazing app! I truer it the first day, and was amazed by how easy it is to control it.. like lets say you needed to stop and take care of something, it lets you pause it. if your playing music on the kindle with the app going on, it will pause the music when your time is up.. I was amazed and you will be too(:
0071752854|4.0|Interesting methodology that is completely counter-intuitive. This is definitely one of the must read kind of books because it provides a different perspective to pitching. I am a designer and I don't pitch $100M but I have to pitch product and feature ideas everyday.<br /><br />A book of this kind is supposed to teach you something and this book definitely does!<br /><br />Not giving 5 stars because the way book is structured is little confusing. (However it is well summarized in the last chapter)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|l love this game if u like zoo story 2 u would love ice age its even better I have been playing this game for the past month the only problem I have with the game is adding friends or visiting other villlages that would be the one thing I would ask the creators of this game to work on other than that the game is awesome.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was NOT like any other I have seen and I wonder where the people who rated it 1 star get this idea from.<br /><br />My only observation of the bad reviews is that almost all of them have something like \\"I think I have a really good sense of humour\\". Really? Perhaps you should dust it off sometime.<br /><br />If was funny, witty and sexy.

B007SSEBCU|5.0|Simply stunning in so many ways!<br /><br />Enough cannot be said about Meryl Steep's acting talent. She does not just turn in a good performance. She transcends the role.<br /><br />Absolutely everything, down to her eye movements, mouth gestures, sloping shoulders, voice projection, her gait and hand movements, were utterly convincing.<br /><br />For any young actor, this movie should be a master class on how subtly can be more profound than exaggeration when it comes to bringing a character to life.<br /><br />And the supporting cast was equally brilliant.<br /><br />The cinematography was carried out with equal expertise. With its slightly dark hue, the picture quality had a real texture to it that simply transports you back to that time period.<br /><br />Some have complained about the movies shortcomings, and they were expecting this and that and the other. I say leave your expectations at the door and appreciate not only Meryl Streep, but a cast and crew of professionals at the top of their game. Here, here!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This game is really slot of fun and I like it when when it gets harder to solve I would play it all the time need to make more games like this
B003X5UDEW|5.0|This is based on a true story, and you can tell.  Not only is the martial arts top notch, but the plot is so compelling.  If you have not yet seen it, then you are missing out and need to watch this immediately, then when you get done you will want to see the sequel which is just as good.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It will absolutely be a Classic.  Extremely entertaining! Definitely should have in your collection to see over and over, and to watch with company, guys, girls, young ones, teenagers, young adults, adults, its for everyone =D<br />It is beautiful and engaging, very funny, and has a great love story.<br />The movie is based on a book series written 100 years ago by the infamous Edgar Rice Burroughs (who also created Tarzan!) It was the inspiration for all modern science fiction including Star Wars, Avatar, and many many more.  You have to see where it all began!

B006LQQ1GE|4.0|First name Wouter, last name De Backer. But call him Wally, or Gotye - as in Go-tee-yay. Just now hitting the pinnacle of the Target and Best Buy endcaps, the Australia-based Gotye has been selling reasonably well around the world for years now, making diverse discs that remind very much of the tantric spirit of Sting and the new age-y overproduced weirdness of Peter Gabriel. In his native land, the man is the man, his 2006 record, Like Drawing Blood, long-considered to be one of the best pop records the country has ever produced. And now, in the U.S. - and around most of the rest of the civilized world - Gotye is selling big numbers, thanks mostly to his \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" single.    But American ears are just now really catching on. Last year Making Mirrors was a phenomenon in Australia and elsewhere, going Platinum on the day it was released in Poland. When I first saw the \\"Somebody\\" video, totally by chance on YouTube one lonely spring night, I was left cold. The track was weird and icy and awkward and the people in the video kinda/sorta put the creeps up my spine. It felt like art made for retail ears, and I don't like art made for retail ears. But then I heard the song - and saw the awkward video - a few more times, here and there around the hood, and started to like it. Mostly, I liked the cutesy and super detailed - but also kinda minimalist spirited - feel of the accompaniment. The big, blaring, super serious and dramatic vocals still put me off at first, but the song got stuck in my head. So much so that I found myself dashing through the Target aisles one night; there to buy some bread and coffee but instead trying to grab the last copy of Making Mirrors before the joint closed shop for the day. I'd been years - or even a decade or more - since I'd bought a compact disc at a big box store from an artist whom I'd never researched. I was curious. And, I suppose, bored.    Since \\"Somebody\\" felt so strange and sexy, I decided to crack open a bottle of wine, slip into my robe and headphones and couch it up, just me and SexyBoyGotye. I recall being almost instantly surprised at the variety of composition I heard over the first few tracks. Sure, the guy has a serious Sting thing going on, but he looks more like a Sebadoh sideman than a sex addict singer, and so the association didn't feel so rape-y. After an awkward and overwhelming first spin I played the disc again. Bottle number two. This time around I found some songs that I really enjoyed, starting with a track called \\"Easy Way Out\\" that sounds more like a Gorillaz banger than anything String ever took to bed. And, of course, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" was good - even if 'ol Wouter was stealing from m'man Elliott Smith.    As I've become increasingly familiar with the record's 12 tracks over the last two weeks I've developed a strange admiration for Gotye. No, I wouldn't say that I actually like most of the songs on Making Mirrors, but I do respect them. Just about any one of the 12 could be played on the radio and stand a chance at having that same weirdo, overly-emo appeal that \\"Somebody\\" has struck the nation with. Every cut has its own thing going on and each song is worth examining, especially if you like weirdo pop music from the last 30ish years. \\"I Feel Better\\" is a Fauxtown gem that I promise you Cee-Lo is playing in his Hummer at this very moment. A future U.S. radio hit, possibly, and one of my favorite tracks on the record. \\"State of the Act\\" is an oddball dub track that wouldn't sound out of place on an album released by a band opening for Animal Collective or The Dirty Projectors.    What I'm saying is this: Gotye is the real deal. I don't really like most of what he does, but I respect it and, as I've become more and more familiar with each song, I've come to kinda/sorta like Making Mirrors as a whole. The man has a lot of big ideas and he knows how to pull them off as a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, singer and producer. And I got love for that kind of complete artistry. Also, with Coldplay and U2 not doing anything too interesting these days, there's definitely a huge market for a sexy white guy who likes to croon the stadium to sleep for the upper class. Don't be surprised if Gotye ends up being one of the biggest selling artists in the U.S. over the next few years, for better or worse.    Check out more of my film- and music-focused writing at [...]

0345529057|3.0|I've just received the books. I must say I was very surprised about the paper quality (and yes, I mean it on the worst-case scenario.<br />I've seen better-quality toilet paper, and the printing is far far faaar away of being acceptable. The font is very small as well, so it's difficult to read for me (and all my short sighted fellows, I assume).<br /><br />I cannot deny that the container box is really pretty, the quality is a bit better than the books this time and the images are nicely printed but the box itself is really tight and the books fit without living not the minimum space, so sometimes it's hard to take one of them off without breaking the box.<br /><br />On the other hand, I must be realistic: I paid $23 for 4 long books that are trendy as hell right now and that came in a very  cute box. Considering that the prize is almost the same of a single book (If you buy them separately) I think that It's a good value for money. Besides I wanted a cheap copy of the books so I can reread them without ruining the ones I have..and that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />p/d: Luckily there are no pages missing or unproperly cut on the ones I received, so I cannot make an opinion on that.<br /><br />My final review: Recommended if you want to read the books without spending too much money.
1455518999|5.0|Some reviewers are criticizing the author for creating a character they feel mimics Jack Reacher.  I read every Jack Reacher novel as soon as it comes out, but I would never give one a five, as entertaining as they are.  There are always things that bother me about Reacher.  In one novel, he doesn't change clothes in a hot climate for five days.  Now, I know I'm not supposed to notice or worry about that but I do notice because the author makes a point of always reminding me that Reacher buys clothes--occasionally--instead of carrying any with him.  He does occasionally wash some of them but not enough for me to not think about how he must stink much of the time.  That pulls me out of the story, and then I start thinking about how unbelievable some of it is.  That's a four, at best.<br /><br />John Puller is a more complex, believable Reacher, if some readers insist on a comparison.  He has a strong appreciation of family and tries to preserve his own, hard as it is. He appreciates the discipline the Army has taught him, including taking pride in himself, which fosters paying attention to his clothing.  He is a patriot who understands that, while he believes in the U.S. Army and the United States, his eyes are wide open to the weakness, corruption, blind ambition, intransigence and just plain wrong-headedness of individual Army officers and government officials.  That's why he refuses promotions and stays where he can do the job he knows he is best suited for: solving crimes against the citizens of the United States.<br /><br />John Puller is a character I hope Mr. Baldacci will make a prominent part of his literary family.
0345455681|3.0|If you like Michener, you'll probably enjoy this book.  I don't think Rutherfurd is quite as talented a writer as Michener, but he also didn't spend 100+ pages at the beginning of the book boring the reader with his geology descriptions.  As with any book covering so many centuries and so many people, it was hard to keep track of all the characters and their relationships.  I do wish there had been more happy outcomes and not so many sad ones.
0345803493|5.0|Ok, let me preface this by saying this was my first erotic series.  I was very impressed with the depth of the storyline.  The author has you really caring about this couple and rooting for their success.  The sex is hot as hell and disturbing at the same time.  Interesting combo for me.  Just finished the second book, can't wait to see how it ends!
0671449028|5.0|I bought it when my son was <1 year old and now he is 2+ yr old and still loves this book though the pages have all came out (not because the quality of the book but my son tore it up)

0316010669|5.0|This book was a great read into understanding human perceptions and judgements. The key points for me were:<br /><br />*The mind uses 2 strategies to make sense of a situation: 1. conscious strategy, thinking about what we learn, it's the logical strategy. 2. Knowing something without knowing, before it hits our consciousness.<br />*We have an adaptive unconscious, an efficient action initiator, causing humans to take action immediately.<br />*Quick decisions are as good as cautious decisions - our unconscious mind is powerful.<br />*Snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.<br />*We can learn to make better snap judgements.<br />*We have a rapid cognition ability called \\"thin-slicing\\" - where the unconscious mind engages in automatic tasks.<br />*Wen we see 2 people perhaps having an argument, we can recognize a pattern that arises: A distinctive signature rises naturally and automatically.<br />*People are in 2 states in a relationship: 1. Positive sentiment over-ride: positive emotions over-ride irritability. 2. Negative sentiment over-ride: neural things are perceived negative.<br />*Defensiveness, stone-walling, criticism and contempt, are signs of marriage or relationship fail.<br />*Thin-slicing is better than deliberate and exhausting thinking.<br />*You can learn as much or more from one glance at a bedroom than hours of exposure to public face.<br />*If you talk to a doctor who is not listening, talking you down - try to listen to that feeling.<br />*Snap judgements are quick and unconscious. We need to accept snap judgements.<br />*The priming technique: Example; If you prime \\"cooperation\\" into people, people will cooperate. However, prime \\"old\\", and people will feel old.<br />*How we think and act, and how well we think and act, is susceptible to outside influence.<br />*We are often too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't have an explanation for.<br />*We can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than months of study.<br />*If you're selling something - never judge people on appearance. Treat everyone equal.<br />*People make sophisticated decisions without a script or plot.<br />*Successful decision making relies on balance between deliberate and instinctively thinking.<br />*Fragility matters: snap judgements and rapid cognition.<br />*We can learn alot about how people think just by observing: body language, facial expressions, even looking at their book shelves.<br />*The face is a rich source of information about emotions.<br />*The information on our faces demonstrates what is going in inside our heads.<br />*Our facial expressions have an effect on our nervous system.<br /><br />And closing up to finish the book... the lessons of blink are:<br /><br />First lesson: Recognize the characteristic signs of judgement's fragility.<br />Second lesson: Understand instinctive decision making.<br />Third lesson: Said to be the most important lesson; Knowing less about things/people. The key to good decision is not knowledge, it's understanding.<br /><br />A question is asked on when should one use the \\"blink\\", thing-slicing methods and what not. The author says there are no answers, we all have different situations and circumstances. However we need to combine rational analysis (conscious thinking) with instinctive judgement (unconscious thinking).
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is a really good book.... Ok im gonna let all my frustratsion out right now AUGHAUGHAUGHAUGH noooooooooooooooo not another year please dont do this to meeeeeeeeeee what happens to percy and annabeth and my fave charecter leo!!!!!!<br /><br />ok other then finishing the book in two days and having to wait another year for the house of hades this was an excellant book. i also noticed in every book by rick theres always a stupid monster(coughcough....otis....coughcough). and is it just me or is this series much better then the kane chronicles. egypt mythology just doesnt work for me. anyways this is the best book ever written. if you hate this series i will stalk you and blow you up.(jk ..... sort of)
B003O86FMW|5.0|While you're reading through some of the action scenes in \\"Catching Fire,\\" you'll probably realize that this time out Katniss has no clue as to what's going on around her. I was reading along, trying to match wits with the author . . . and failed miserably. The twist, when it occurs, fooled me completely. I'd love to tell you what I thought would happen, but then you'd have to kill me.<br /><br />Anyway, this book continues what began in \\"The Hunger Games\\" and bridges nicely toward the final book in the trilogy, \\"The Mockingjay,\\" which I can't wait to start. The charm is watching Katniss evolve from pawn to, well, queen perhaps? I'll soon know.<br /><br />It's easy to see why these books seem to have captured the heart of America.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|The album is full of gems. Gives a taste of a sweeter side to Amy Winehouse.  It's not exactly your fully developed album of course, but it's a great listen overall.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Best office mobile app out there. Has all basic functions for editing and creating new documents. Plus with a quick email I can continue with MS Office 2007 or 2010 on my PC. Also works the other way. I can send what I'm working on back to my phone to continue while I'm out.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I love the eBook. If you have seen the TV series \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" you will recognize the characters. The books are richer in detail and explains more about Khalin, Richard and Zed. Be prepared for a different storyline with the books than the TV show. Regardless, I still enjoyed reading book #2. Can't wait for the next one.
B00004XP35|4.0|This is a very good quality vinyl, its a 180 gram and it has all the benefits that you have in a Capitol vinyl, they have extraordinary quality, they last very long and the sound is very rich.

B0061S073A|5.0|I Got this app for my 2 year old. it makes her stay with in the apps I choose for her and away from the rest of my kindle. never encountered any problems. I read a few complaints posted that are easily fixed by the settings menu of the app :). read and review the apps and all its options first people!
B007VGXS8M|1.0|It worked fine right after I downloaded it. Now the app wont let me select an option to start the game again. Total waste of money. It will mess with your kindle fire!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|this app is very fun I just wish their would be more levels for free but the game is very fun
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I loved it and I watch it as offen as I can Emily is wounderful in this movie<br /> Rupert Friend i cannot wait to see these actors again hopefully working with each other in more movies  thanks.<br /><br />  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Well designed tool by Gerber. Bear who? Yeah, I know, but I bought this because it was a Gerber (a company known for building quality products), not because of the endorsement by Bear Grylls. I've had an all metal SOG for years, I have to say I find this Gerber a better design, SOG and Gerber are both quality tools. At $30 I find this a very good deal. Recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this app. every game is entertaining. i haven't unlocked every game yet. looking forward to be able to play all the games. the ads don't bother me because they load fast and disappear fast.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An enjoyable read that is hard to put down. Simple yet entertaining plot(s) and clear descriptions as well as flow.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Really interesting book in the 1q84 triology. Well written and exoctic reading for a European even if it not a classic Japanese story with focus on Japanese traditions. Enjoyed reading all 3 books.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|the game starts off well but then it glitches all the timers for buildings suddenly take 116 hours before they pay out I end up selling buildings that glitch.  then I rebuy them this game has been on my kindle 10 days and I'm on my fourth glitch
0345803485|1.0|I read up to 59% and that was SUCH a struggle.  The book is hard for me to read because it seems so unbelievable and the main character - Ana-, is not like a real person at all. I can even believe things about Mr. Grey and he seems real but it is just repetative and boring and I really didn't like the sex in it at all. I did understand there would be sex scenes in the book before I got it, but this just seems too much and having to read that stuff every other page just made it extremely difficult to get through. I really want to finish it simply because I purchased it but I am having a very hard time doing so. I wish it was more believable and more romance-like though I am not even a fan of romance books for the most part either. Maybe if I had done more research before purchasing the book I would have understood it wasn't my kind of book at all, I just got it because I heard a few good reviews and no one complained about it having vivid, graphic, sex scenes in it, and even if they had said that I would not have thought the entire book was about that. So , next time I get a book, I will be more sure what I am getting before hand.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Great writing, great detail, and great storyline....Very impressed with this writing and author!!! I am not surprised this author enjoyed Twilight because I definitely see somewhat of a correlation however this definitely is an adult version!
B005DOL0R0|4.0|It is a very attractive cover.  The kindle is very well protected.  I would appreciate a pocket on the outside.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a very good time passer..it gets addicting...I love it..other comments say they cant go back to home..just got to options ans it appears
0345803485|5.0|Shades of Grey trilogy was one of the best books ive read in a long time!  I couldnt put it down.  I ended up getting all 3 on my tablet this weekend and just finished! While some may disagree, I found it to be a wonderful defintion of unconditional love! Very erotic, sexual, and naughty, maybe even a bit taboo, but the storyline of a person's past and the reasons they are the way they are was wonderful to read! I give it 5 stars and highly recommmend!

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was so fun I actually began to enjoy. Then I wasn't getting a notification that said I needed to come collect from my crops and what not. I checked the timer and it said 118 hours I was a little upset but was willing to wait now the timer is increasing instead of decreasing. Uninstalling now!
B0063GORYU|4.0|not too easy, not too hard, just right for a quick but interesting game break. plenty of options and settings.

1612130283|5.0|In order to appreciate 50 Shades of Grey one must be able to look past the highly charged sexual situations that our main characters find themselves in...and they DO find themselves in these situations quite often.  This story about perspective (how one's perspective can change in an instant), fear (how it can paralyze and drive a person to need to control every aspect of life), and love (how it can heal).  In \\"Grey\\" sex is used in so many ways to tell the story of Christan and Anastasia:  a weapon, a shield, enjoyment, and love.  Both characters experience such growth and depth it is a shame that so many focuse on simply the sex.  Many say Ana is unrealistic as a young virgin who has never self-gratified - there are many out there in this day and age who simply wait (or have not had the opportunity for sex).  It may seem that all teenagers and young adults want to \\"get busy\\" but it's not about that.  It's about a sexual awakening...for both of them.  For Ana...it's about realizing her power as a woman.  For Christian...it's about realizing that love and sex together can be beautiful and frightening.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down...and I immediately had to read the other two.  It's an amazing story...you won't be sorry you read it...if you look beyond the sexual words on a page as though it were soft core porn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard about this book and then the movie and wanted to see what all the hype was about. The beginning was a little slow, but I kept on going because I knew it would get better. And it did! The second part of the book \\"The Quell\\" was amazing. You literally feel every emotion while reading this book from sad to happy to angry to confused to overwhelmed. I highly suggest you read this book and then go see the movie. I would not, however, let younger children read this book or see the movie as it is graphic, both the book and movie.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this Is a really fun game amazon finally decides to come out with something fun now they need temple run the only thing bad is the adds but that's what the payed version is for
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the Wool series. Most of the time I end up writing a review because I wasted my time reading something that disappointed me.  It is frustrating when you read all the 5 star reviews on a book and you end up wondering what they were thinking. This was not the case with Wool.  A great story setting and characters that you care about. It is not just all that, it is the questions that the story makes you think about.  Like life, not all the choices you have are clear cut. A great price for a great book.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Video quite good, but the sound has to be turned all the way up in order to hear the audio. Otherwise, great!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|so like I said before. it keeps closing on me before I get to play. but other than that, its fun.
0345803485|1.0|I had the book lent to me from a friend and I must say, one of the WORST I have ever read. I never finished reading the Twilight series (I read the first 3 pages and stopped because of how terrible the writing was) and as I was reading this book, I felt the same annoyance about James' writing. It is extremely mundane, and frustrating to read. And when a character as boring as Ana tries to describe what is going on around her and to her, you might just want to shoot yourself in the foot. While reading, I felt as though I should slap her right across the face for being so infuriating. She says things such as, \\"...down THERE,\\" when referring to her vagina (just say vagina...) and she abuses the \\"inner goddess\\" line way too much as well. I find that the main character talks more about herself and how awkward she is than anything else that could potentially make the book progress, even slightly. Christian is not much of a great read either. Yes he's rich and handsome, but there's really not much more too it, other than his \\"issues.\\" I'm not familiar with the BDSM scene, but from what I've researched online and compared to the book, the author really barely has the slightest clue as to what goes on in it. Just please save yourself the trouble and DO NOT buy this book. If you want to experience the horribleness for yourself, so be it, but you have been warned.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of Mario I like it! fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought it because my i7-2600k was overheating very easily with the stock cooler. It's working great!!. Temperatures dropped about 10C and it's actually quieter than i expected. Really pleased...
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a free app so what do you expect no adds lol if it was paid then there wouldn't be no adds. If ur too lazy to pay 1$ for the paid version with no adds then its ur fault. The people who made this game made it for money that's why they have adds for MONEY. Take off the adds it equals the 1$ they charged for add free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't think the second book could be as good as the first, but it did not disappoint! Absolutely loved this book and the whole series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|games are great! every single one is fun and enjoyable for everyone of different ages, I highly recommend it for everyone that absolutely loves games! :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great animation. game play is fast paced and fun. its a lot like the tap zoo wit more to do.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps my 5 year old busy for hrs. could ask for any better games for hand eye coordantion and challanging to the brain.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app out there.  Gives you exactly what you need to plan your day and the radar feature is spot on for coverage.  Hourly and extended forecasts have been very accurate.  Maybe that's why they call it Accuweather!
B0033QC0WE|3.0|I am apparently one of the very few who rank this set as overrated.  The musicans play great but the conductor leads them astray.  Perhaps it really is what Beethoven wanted (who knows?) but for me, a fast tempo does not neccesarily equal passion.  The speed robs the works of some of their greatness and my ears cannot savor the majesty I'm used to.  It is a fun listen in the sense you've probably not heard them like this before but I'm not sure it will stand up to repeated and repeated and repeated listening.  I'll give it some more time but so far, I'd say overrated.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is the best series of books I have read in a long, long time and I am an avid reader. I felt that they were so much better than the Twilight Series by Stephanie Meyer. Once I started reading the Hunger Games I could not put it down and I called my husband to purchase the other two in the series for me. Once I finished reading them my husband started reading them and he couldn't put them down either. My husband normally loves television but he didn't even turn on the tv for days while he was reading them. They are definitely must reads!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|The book started off well, but that was it.  Very depressing and just when I thought there was hope to save the story, the author dashed it! Never again will I select a William Landay book.  Burned
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Great Movie would highly recommend it to anybody.  Had a great story for all the actors involved and they all played their parts very well
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am very happy that I thought to purchase the Hunger Games Trilogy for my vacation.  I was caught up with the story quickly and couldn't put it down for long.  Great story.
0385344228|2.0|In the opening pages of this novel, an affluent community is terrorized by a murder in their midst and are scurying to identify the perpetrator.  Unfortunately, the author sucks all tension and suspense from these introductory pages by inaptly titling his novel,\\"Defending Jacob.\\" A title that gives away too much too early.  A dumb spoiler that could have easily been avoided with some commonsense understanding of reader psychology.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|I don't know that I would hand it the greatest martial arts movie ever title, but it should definitely be a pleasant surprise for fans of martial arts films. This is an odd little film, it almost plays like a 70's martial arts film, maybe by design. I was afraid for a moment I was going to have to sit through subtitles. The action however, was very impressive, as good as any modern movie, and better. My only criticism was the final fight should have been the best, and I don't believe it was. Also, don't expect to watch this one for realism. All of the fights are pretty much one sided, and If I am not mistaken the hero actually only gets hit once throughout the entire movie, so. This movie is still a must see for martial art film fans, in a way, it is unlike anything you have ever seen.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I cannot wait for this dvd so i can relive the concert experience. I saw her in Atlanta and loved it so much i went to see her again in Greensboro. this time i spent more money and got excellent seats because it was worth it. I dont think i have ever spent that much on a concert ticket and would do it all over again.
1849025975|5.0|I haven't read Orwell since I was made to run the gamut of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' in high school, and I'm glad I picked him up again. Orwell manages to make the Spanish civil war (a topic I don't know anything about other than that it was called the Spanish civil war) both fairly comprehensible and at the same time deeply personal. His memories of slogging through trenches covered in filth, scrounging for firewood and in general being bored out of his mind, offers a sobering, sincere look at the life of a solider. He has that droll English wit which allows him to walk a fine line between humorously belittling the messy world of Spanish socialist warfare (and his own mud-soaked involvement in it) and at the same time manages to show why the conflict was so genuinely important as europe started to tilt towards fascism and destruction. This book makes me want to go out and read everything else he ever wrote.
1609611543|4.0|This book changed my life. In fact, it may have SAVED it!<br /><br />I had read some negative reviews about it, so I was skeptical about it's value. It is well written with a lot of light humor, which makes it easy to read<br /><br />read the rest of my review <a href=\\"[...]\\">here</a>
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|I was annoyed by the book, but I'm even more annoyed that people found it so fantastic.  All the characters were stereotypes, and none of them were well developed.  The only one who exhibited any emotion was Ms. Celia, and her story was just a sidenote.  The book had all the politically correct themes: New York Jew, good--Mississippi Christian, bad.  Working woman, good--homemaker, bad.  Poor people, good--rich people, bad.  The ugly duckling is of course the hero, and the author even threw in a passage on homosexual acceptance near the end.  The pie thing was absolutely disgusting, and infuriated me.  So this woman doesn't have the guts to stand up to her husband's beatings, but she's brave enough to do something like that?  Plus, so what if they wrote a book outing their bosses?  Skeeter benefited, but the help didn't. Their lives didn't change for the better at all, so what was the point.  I was sooo glad to be done with this, I'm tossing it straight into the trash.
B000056TKC|5.0|First, I'll note that I am not that knowledgable about music to be able to write a critical review.  This was my first Ninth, back in about 1980 on vinyl.  I had not listened to it in probably 20 years.  In fact, I had not listened to the Ninth it 20 years.  Meanwhile in the past year I have acquired 20 different Ninths, many very wonderful ones, but still did not find one that stood out above all the rest.  Having the vinyl, I did not buy the Fricsay Ninth, hoping to find it in a library and copy it.  Finally I couln't stand it any longer and ordered a copy. It is phenominal.  This is my desert island Ninth.  For me, it's the vocals that make the Ninth, and this has the perfect vocals.  Each voice is beautiful and the harmonizations are wonderful.  I basically stopped listening to the other 20 Ninths since I got the Fricsay Ninth.  For the record, the other 20 are: Stokowski 1934, Weingartner 1935, Klemperer 1956, Walter 1959, Monteau 1962, Masur 1974, Karajan 1977, Maazel 1978, Blomstedt 1980, Solti 1984, Blomstedt 1985, Duvier 1990, Harnoncourt 1991, Gardiner 1992, Zinman 1994, Drahos 1996, Torre 2006, Zander 1992, Leinsdorf 1969, and Munch 1958.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|love this show, everything about it is exceptionally well done. never had an interest in collecting movies or TV series but, this is a series that i can watch many times over and still find fresh, and entertaining.

B006C1DH92|5.0|this was the very first game I bought on my kindle fire back in December and I still love playing it.this game is a lot of fun for adults and children. my niece is 5 and she loves to play as much as I do.<br />not only is this game fun to play but it's also a good way to strengthen  hand, eye coordination for adults and children.<br />if your looking for a game to play to make the time go by faster this is a great choice when you start playing the time goes by so fast.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Paul in a senior citizen now, and one can detect that his voice isn't as strong as it once was. However, in this CD containing standards and tunes his father used to sing at home when he was a child, McCartney still manages to deliver a heartfelt performance of songs that are perfect for sipping wine to as he wraps himself gently around each lyric. Surprisingly, my favorite cut from the album is the one he recently wrote himself--\\"My Valentine.\\" ..... Len
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it's a lot of fun it's well worth the 99cents I'm actually surprised it doesn't cost more. if  you buy this game I can promise you wont be disappointed  when you first start playing you may think this game is way to easy, (which at first it is)  but trust me stick with it and it gets a lot harder and a lot more fun after the first few levels that's when you'll find yourself not wanting to put it down so you can see what the next level is then next thing you know you've been playing this game for the last 45min. or even the last hour.

B004IY6API|5.0|I still remember the day I bought Judas Priest's Stained Class album. It was the first time I bought a Priest album and I picked it up along with British Steel (that I was somewhat familiar with) but I was more curious about Stained and that's the one I played first. I wasn't leaving the record store without British Steel for sure, but I still don't know why I picked SC over any of the other Priest albums that were in the store, it's almost as if it talked to me. To this day it remains one of my favorite albums and I consider it my first by Priest and I know there are many special Judas Priest albums but Stained Class is very special to me. Released in 1978, noticeably it was the first album to feature Les Bink on drums with his technical drumming approach that would make him a fan favorite. I feel this is where Priest really found and idealized their Metal sound although there was plenty of hints with their previous two offerings, (and with their next album Killing Machine/Hell Bent for Leather began the leather image of the genre) although most would say that they perfected or defined the sound of Heavy Metal music with British Steel. It's also the first album to feature the Judas Priest logo.<br /><br />Highlights? Many but to me the diamond on this album is \\"Beyond The Realms of Death\\", probably the most complex song in their catalog (and yes, that's a good thing). I don't think Priest reached that level of epic since. The passion in Rob Halford's voice, K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton's mighty celestial guitar work, Les Bink's complementing drumming, the bass... Everything works. A deep, dark song but a beautiful one at that. I cannot, I repeat, cannot stress how amazing this song is. The opener \\"Exciter\\" is as heavy and fast as it gets an opener in 1978 and Rob's voice soars epic heights towards the end, pure Metal done right by the Metal Gods.  \\"White Heat, Red Hot\\" is considerably slower and less aggressive but very effective, great track. \\"Better By You Better Than Me\\" is the most talked about song of the album, a Spooky Tooth cover that was controversial in the suicide of two teenagers. The title track is another highlight although it's one of my least favorites here which doesn't mean much as all the album's tracks are fantastic. \\"Savage\\" was written about the native Indians's point of view in an interesting historical storytelling a la Maiden (Notice how my description makes it sound like \\"Run to the Hills\\", in a sense I suppose...minus the galloping). Halford shines on this track and it's one of the most interesting songs on Stained Class, the one-two punch of \\"Beyond\\" and this left a mark on me. \\"Hero's End\\" is memorable for its breakdown parts (thumping bass is where it's at here) and incredible guitar performances, I like how Rob uses different timbres of voice to do the lead and backing on this particular one it adds such a powerful effect. The live version of \\"Better...\\" is a nice inclusion but nothing special.<br /><br />A previous reviewer said that Stained Class is a link between the Classic Rock of the early 1970's and the early Heavy Metal bands and I think it's a fitting description. Classic Rock in general borrows a lot from the blues sound which is very much present in those band's guitar sound and some bands like Black Sabbath are at the core of it all, a heavy blues band. Judas Priest however, were quite possibly the first band to drop the blues-influences and go for a faster, chugging twin guitars and although their two previous albums, Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) and Sin After Sin (1977) were in heavy territory themselves (their debut Rocka Rolla was blues-ier) Stained Class is a full on Metal attack. Sin After Sin was getting there but even that album had some (excellent) more rock oriented songs and softer like \\"Last Rose of the Summer\\" whereas from the beginning of SC \\"Exciter\\" screams Metal and stays so; it's a heavier type of Rock N' Roll alright. The resulting work is admirable.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason I enjoy Stained Class so much is because it wasn't as popular as albums like British Steel and Screaming For Vengeance and because its songs weren't played that much except \\"Better By You Better Than Me\\" and nearly every song is a gem that stands out. Those well versed into Heavy Metal would do great by picking up Stained Class and fans of Judas Priest would be advised strongly to pick up a copy of this album, it ranks up there with Sin After Sin, Killing Machine, British Steel, Defenders of the Faith and I'll throw in Sad Wings of Destiny as well. With an impressive body of work like Priest's its sometimes easy to overlook every diamond they produced and this is a fantastic album, masterful musicianship, excellent lyrics I'm running out of things to say. A classic Priest AND Metal album. Rating: The highest possible with extra recommendation.aps the reason I enjoy Stained Class so much is because it wasn't as popular as albums like British Steel and Screaming For Vengeance and because its songs weren't played that much except \\"Better By You Better Than Me\\" and nearly every song is a gem that stands out.

0670023329|5.0|Unbelievably horrific. It is a disturbing account of brutality of a communist regime that sadistically abuses its own citizens. This book chronicles the life of a young man whose family was put in a 'prison camp' because his relatives had defected to South Korea in 1950s. How messed up a country can be? I have to say that I had a hard time reading this book and I could not put it down. It is just horrendous. I don't know if I can find proper adjectives to describe what I have learned about Shin's life and north Korea in general. Oh my goodness... This is a 'Must Read' for anyone who is interested to know what the North Korean communist regime has done to its people.
0345803485|1.0|All of the 1 star reviews say everything I want to say about this book: terribly written, repetitive, immature, inaccurate, unbelievable characters...I couldn't even finish it...got through the first sex scene and was done. Wish I would have read through the negative reviews before I purchased this book but am looking forward to checking out the other erotic authors that have been recommended.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I purchased this for my 2 year old son. He loved the other two movies, and he loves Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked also. I thought it was funny, but could use a little more singing in it like the second movie. Over all it is a very good title for kids.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game was super fun until I got to about level 40 and almost all of my stores and houses would say &quot;ready&quot; but you were unable to collect from them. Being so far along in the game, I decided to sell all the glitchy ones and rebuild them all. It fixed the problem and I was able to continue playing until I got a few more levels in and then my energy level would never reset and all my stores and houses were set to a time like &quot;312 hours&quot;. This was one of the best games I've played until it started having issues. It's probably wise not to spend &quot;real&quot; money on this game because it will be wasted in the end. If the problems were worked out, I would give this game a 5 star rating but as it is right now, it's more frustrating than anything.
B004I744AS|5.0|I highly recommend this for your Kindle Fire. Finding the definition of a word is very quick. It provides all the information you'd expect from a quality dictionary.

B0071T5PN0|2.0|some rock & roll lead singers -- many, in fact -- are able to age and retain the vast majority of their vocal skills. david lee roth is very, very far from being one of them.<br /><br />the songwriting is still there, for the most part. although it has not progressed two months since their 1984 album. this makes the whole thing a bit challenging to listen to if you've managed to evolve as a human being and/or music fan since the days of Panama. they didn't need to become poet laureates or anything, but the subject matter and perspective is pretty much right there where it was when the DLR era ended. that said, i'm glad mister roth and the van halen trio were able to do this.<br /><br />i still think it's sad how they stiffed michael anthony, but it made a little more sense after seeing VH live last night, when i watched wolfie share a microphone with his old man (what father-son wouldn't want to do that?). speaking of eddie, he looked much healthier than he has for some time now, i'm pleased to report.<br /><br />above all, i for one am glad to have the musical answer to \\"i wonder what it would sound like if van halen ever got david lee roth back?\\"<br /><br />now that the answer is there for all of us to purchase, until diamond dave can become a r&r vocalist again, i sincerely hope this is the last VH reunion.<br /><br />it really was fun while it lasted.
0985114606|5.0|This was a wonderful book!!  If you liked the Fifty Shades trilogy you probably will love this book. We have 2 more seriously emotionally scarred young successful lovers. Both are unsecure,scared,and lost in this new environment of emotional seclusion. The main characters of course are very similar but also have MAJOR differences than the ones in the Fifty Shades trilogy. It has alot more sex. Sometimes too much, but Ms. Day ties it in with the particular scene exceptionally well. I loved it and cant wait wait for \\"Deeper in You\\", which is the sequel.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|To get it out of the way: Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing in this movie. She *is* Margaret Thatcher. I mean, I grew up with Thatcher being in power and used to see her on the news all the time, and Streep's performance is just so authentic -- no wonder she won an Oscar for it. I might have given the movie five stars just for her.<br /><br />But actually there's much more to be said for the film. For one thing, the relationship between Margaret and her husband Dennis is depicted in a wonderfully tender and touching way, making her so much more human than she used to appear in the news media. For that matter, it is a great testament to Dennis Thatcher as well, who kept himself in the background during his wife's political career but lovingly supported her and gave her strength.<br /><br />The political events of Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister structure the movie nicely and anchor it in the viewer's own experience (assuming he or she is old enough to have witnessed them firsthand). Especially refreshing is the scene with Thatcher and US Secretary of State Alexander Haig (though I have to say the actor looked nothing like Haig) in which the latter tries to dissuade her from going to war over the Falklands.<br /><br />The most moving aspect of the film is, of course, Thatcher's struggle with dementia and her husband's passing. The back and forth between her successful if contentious political life in the 1970s and 80s and her difficulties in coping with everyday matters now set this issue in particularly tragic relief. While I had always admired Thatcher for her powerful and unwavering personality, and particularly for blasting her own path through male-dominated British politics, I (like many others) always thought of her as rather cold and unfeeling. Well, I can't say that now.<br /><br />This movie will entertain you, teach you a thing or two about recent British history, and make you think about power, love, age, and decline. A wonderful combination.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This soundtrack deserves to be crowned one of the greatest musical achievements of the decade. The score flows perfectly from piece to piece, exactly mirroring the movie's visuals, from the soaring epic score of \\"Test Drive\\", to the playfulness of \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" and \\"See You Tomorrow\\", to the beautiful love song \\"Romantic Flight\\". The music fits so perfectly into the movie that I can't help watching it in  my mind as I hear the songs.

B0019KC4UE|2.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE Selling England By the Pound (Bonus Dvd) (Hybr) REMIXED VERSION OF THIS ALBUM<br /><br />I am a bit dismayed with tastes now-a-days... I am not too old, not too young. This album was originally recorded, mixed and mastered a couple years before I was born and I hate to say it, but those efforts were way more sublime and appropriate for this album, an album of delicate and articulate material.<br /><br />It seems some of the original tracks could not be found for this remix. The most beautiful and endearing vocals ever delivered by Gabriel open the original mixes of this album. But on this version those a capella opening lines are very noticeably different form the original mixes and here on this remix sound more like a patch work of two or three takes. Overall very weak and enough to ruin this re-presentation of Selling England By The Pound for this listener.<br /><br />As seems to be the case with all of these Nick Davis re-mixes, the stereo mix definitely took the back-seat to the surround mix. Sometimes the mix feels congested, nasal in the mid-range, sometime vocals are in that mid-range jumble and sometimes they jump into you lap. I dare say I think ONLY the 5.1 mixes were created or even cared about in this very ambitious Genesis re-mix project. Most likely an automated, computer decided upon, stereo mix-down is what we are left with, those of us who still prefer 2 (or 2.1).<br /><br />Nick did a good job on the definitive remasters, especially with The Lamb... I would suggest sticking with those if you want to hear nicely EQed and cleaner versions of the original stereo mixes of any/all Genesis albums. A lot of what was done by the original engineers and producers of those albums really did enhance and solidify Genesis' in-studio presence and overall musical presentation.
0439023491|1.0|The first book was somewhat entertaining, second proved to just be more of the same. I think she should have ended it when she was ahead. I couldn't even get through this one.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is not a new concept and other classics like Brave New World and 1984 have done it better. I am sad to see that teens are replacing those novels with this teen melodrama that isn't nearly as captivating or well written. :(

B001MYIXAC|4.0|A sweet story of a first love the under-thirteen-y.o. bullied boy felt in with a vampire appearing as a girl of the same age, their mutual support and things mortally-dangerous occurring in Sweden of the late seventies.<br /><br />I don't like this sort of human-dead corps relations as my [[ASIN:B001T5D6LK Twilight]] review had testified, but it's a really romantic work touching a range of things existing convincingly, a really talented movie with a great potential for extension, by the same writer saga of [[ASIN:B003Y5H5HY The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]doesn't fill in.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Mark Lanegan has made yet another excellent album. Picking up from where he left off on the fantastic Bubblegum, he continues to address the dark side of the sub-culture wrapped up in bad habits. You know who you are if you can relate to lines like \\"Don't it feel so bad,\\" found in the song Muddy Water. This collection of songs seems a bit more cohesive than the group of songs on Bubblegum (which still flowed very well in my opinion.) To me, it seems like the natural evolution of that album, kind of like what Exile on Main St. was to Sticky Fingers, if you will. It picks up right where that album left off. He gives all of us that understand what it's like something to look forward to with each of his (solo?)releases. If you're a fan of this man's music, I don't see how you could possibly be let down by this. Electronica, acoustic, distorted, mellow, it doesn't matter how it's put down on tape. It's Mark Lanegan, and he's one of the best there is.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Loving it. Makes the other apps look weak. Used this App with Photo Enhanced Pro for wonderful results. A must have.
B000V1Z8KK|1.0|I agree with what all the other good reviews this movie has gotten. I saw it a couple of years back and wanted to watch it again. I totally forgot the Che Guevara shirt on the middle. If you were ever a victim of the guy directly or indirectly, you'll know he wasn't any better than the bad guys that this movie depicts. In fact, he was worse. If just only because he actually existed.<br /><br />Again, someone in Hollywood trying to push their propaganda. Because it HAS to be black or white. Otherwise it won't sell. A well made movie is never enough. There has to be propaganda and boot kissing to somebody's agenda behind cameras.<br /><br />Of course, nobody cares until someone like that steps on their own foot. And then it's too late.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Nobody does high definition restorations like Disney, especially when it comes to their Diamond Editions.  The image is flawless, the colors are stunning, and the sound is superb.  Anyone who says otherwise is inventing flaws in their mind.  You can see every handrawn line with crystl clear clarity and can almost feel the layers of animation cells laying on top of each other.  The computer gernerated sequences are as good as any Pixar movie has ever been and the movie as a whole has stood the test of time.  This is THE first animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture and it deserves the countless glowing reviews professional Blu-ray sites have given it.  Watching Belle singing on the hillside at sunset gave me goosebumps it was so awe inspiring.  When is crying over the fallen Beast and the first sparks of magic start to fall from the sky, I was in tears at the beauty (no pun intended) of the momment.  This is going into the vault for who knows how long.  Probably until the next generation format is released.  Buy this now!  Don't regret it later!<br /><br />I own over 230 Blu-ray movies and watch them on my 55\\" 8000 series 3D LED tv.  Of all the Disney Classics on Blu-ray (I own them all.), Beauty and the Beast and Lion King are the crowning achievements of Disney's HD restorations.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a fun new addition to the angry birds series. The shots take on a whole new degree of difficulty with the gravity rings and the angles. Enjoy playing it it is a lot of fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love this game its so fun i cant believe i never liked this im ganna slgo so i can ply this
B006NYQAJM|4.0|The price seems to be a bit inflated due to a short supply of this item for the next month.<br />-The action items on this set are plentiful: roller coaster, swinging barrel, trap door, rope on a winch, tilting platform.<br />-5 good characters.<br /><br />The only downside is that it comes apart pretty easy compared to a few other lego items and when it does come apart it is a pain to put back together.<br />It is my 4 year old playing with it and he is below the target age range but still it does fall apart a bit easy compared to other lego.<br />Plan on buying the medium sized lego peg board for this item it is well worth it.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is an awesome series. Already wishing season two was done and out so I could watch it now too.
B004L0NGEC|1.0|Total crap. Uninstalled after trying to organize photos on tablet. No instructions on operation. Waste of money. Total crap!Not recommended. Bad!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome n is so addicting n time passing i cud play it for hours i highly recomend it
B007V2UGPE|4.0|A fun game and can be quite addicting but its hard to beat with out throwing in some real money.
0345803507|5.0|I read all 3 books and love, love, loved them!! I could hardly put them down!! This last book did not disappoint me at all! I am 50 shades in love with this trilogy and that is a hard limit for me!! Hated to finish the series and having a hard time starting on a different book....just want to go back and read these again!! The story is fantastic and if there are movies made, I will be there for all of them!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to play and compete with my wife. keeps u coming back for the next task. kids also love it.
0345803493|5.0|Was so happy that I had this book on my Kindle waiting when I finished Book 1 AND was not disappointed at all! Again, I did not want to put it down and couldn't wait to pick it back up. Think I am in love with Mr C Grey!! Mesmerized by this story of a tortured man, lust and love. It is soooo much more than just about the sex in these novels!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was recommended to me after reading Fifty Shades.  This was a great book and one I could not put down.  I really enjoyed the roller coaster ride of their relationship: the good girl, bad boy.  You are captured from the beginning and do not want to story to end.  I would highly recommend especially if you enjoyed Fifty Shades.  Dare to turn the page!    [...]
B0055SWM08|5.0|Got this when it was the FAOTD and I'm still enjoying it.  The rest of the family enjoys it too.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I don't normally do this type of book. It was very good. I would read another like it. It was very good and surprising at the end.
0545259088|2.0|I enjoyed the first installment, Shiver. But I quickly grew bored with Linger, and I couldn't even finish this final book. The trilogy had promise - a werewolf love story where the wolf eventually takes over. But the numerous characters without much personality development was confusing enough. But the plot moved too slowly and the jumping around from the different characters' point of view finally drove me to drop out of complete disinterest.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a fantastically written trilogy. I couldn't put these books down. The words made me physically visualize what was going on, in short I loved it!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|1.  I'll make this review short and sweet:  forget the politics and forget the pro / con arguments regarding the \\"accuracy\\" of this movie.  Yes, those are important things for a movie that deals with someone's life.  But the overwhelming issue with this movie is even more basic;  it's just a dreadfully boring movie.  Furthermore, this lamest of movies is exacerbated by the terrible method of film making (at least in this case) where the scenes go from the present (ie demented state) to the past.<br />2.  Bottomline:  to all potential folks interested in watching this movie (and it doesn't matter if your liberal, conservative or unclear), just do yourself a huge favor and bypass this movie because it's just simply boring and semi-confused.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Not being an avid reader of books because of time constraints, I downloaded the first book and found that I couldn't put it down. It was so well written and full of detail, it had me in from the start. When I finished reading the last chapter, I knew that I would then have to get the other two books or I would never forgive myself. I certainly wasn't disappointed.<br />Suzanne Collins has such a wonderful way of writing and I can thoroughly recommend the whole trilogy.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Other than bakery story this is my favorite game. The gem system isn't that bad in this game,  ut be careful still. I would definitely recommend this game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down.  The best book I have read in a long time.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|I've got 'em all.  All the solo projects, all the Screaming Trees records.  This one?  This one's a high water mark. (no pun intended).  Lots of variety, emotion, and while a bit dark, this record is amazing.  If you're even a cursory fan of the Trees or Lanegan, just buy this.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|It's a really great choice, performance it's just awesome and if you can OCK, it runs fine!....try to combine it with high performance memories!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Without a doubt, Rhonda Byrne has done it again!  Written a book which is one that all should read!  If one thinks it becomes repetative, its all with good reason.... If she said most of what she does just once, too many would NOT GET IT and then it wouldn't be the effective,  powerful,  life changing advice and information that these books are filled with.... They are the easiest of reads and no one should go without if you are not living the exact life that you want (and you deserve!!!).. its so easy to get to the life you have always wanted and dreamed of.... its really not HARD!!!  Just do it!  :)<br /><br />Great work again, Rhonda!!!  Where do  we go from here???
1250008409|4.0|When you open this book you will invite in a comfortable friend who will guide you towards `doable' (10 minutes a day) meditation and daily mindfulness, share bits of his gentle wisdom and tell you wonderful stories.  The author, Andy Puddicombe, who is Britain's `top meditation guru' says his purpose is to `demystify meditation and to make it something accessible and relevant for modern day living'.<br /><br />He does this, slowly, clearly and comfortably with simple exercises and with tales that both illuminate and amuse.<br /><br />The first chapter opens with one of these stories, as this former Buddhist monk perches on a 12 foot monastery wall and prepares to jump....out.  So right away you know the author is real and down to earth (Pun intended.)  But this escape may be the least of his own challenges which he tells us about and uses to encourage us through our own doubts and difficulties. Meditation sounds simple but it isn't easy and the author knows this.<br /><br />Wisdom from his teachers helps along the way: No resistance means no tension. Emotions are a filter between us and the world. Because we experience a thought does not mean we have to react to it, or act upon it.<br /><br />If you always wanted to learn about meditation and to try it, start here. This simple, yet profound book is rich and as comfortable as a warm cup of tea.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Absolutely amazing read!  Thoroughly developed characters who get under your skin and have you rooting for them or wanting their head.  A rich plot with twists and turns that keep you guessing, but never disappoint with ridiculous or illogical game changers.  I simply can't put it down!!

B007V2UGPE|3.0|I like this game but it gets hard after level 10. can anyone help me pass level 11? by the way it's awesomely spectacular. you'll love it. or maybe not
B0067LXQAW|5.0|Although their last 2 studio albums ([[ASIN:B000VZV756 Wake Up And Smell The Coffee]] and [[ASIN:B000WOUZQS Bury The Hatchet - The Complete Sessions]] almost left me with the sense that maybe I had outgrown their music, I was given this album as a gift. This album connected me back with everything that made me love the Cranberries first three albums. Dolores O'Riordan's voice is still soothing even on harder rocked song and it's good to know Feargal Lawler, Mike and Noel Hogan still round out this great outfit.<br /><br />I love the string arrangements, which evoke [[ASIN:B000VZYVOK Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? (The Complete Sessions 1991-1993)]]and to cite words like maturity when talking about Dolores' songwriting is an understatement. Songs that I find notable are: Conduct, Fire and Soul, Show Me, So Good and the title track Roses. I was given an imported version of this album which came with an extra CD with a live Performance in Madrid Spain, but it just features live performances of old favorites and doesn't really add or take away anything from a great album altogether.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I guess there are a lot of people who don't know how to use their Kindle.  I agree there should be an obvious exit button.  You need to fix the issue concerning visiting other villages.  I haven't seen anyone saying they're not having problems visiting friends.  Also it would be nice to have more mini games to win coins &amp; acorns.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved all 3 and can't wait for a movie to be made! Such an awesome story line with some steaminess to keep your full attention !!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Very enjoyable. Would have preferred if the studio would have kept Terrence Howard instead of Don Cheadle, but still very entertaining.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|I'm very satisfied I have only used it on an old Gateway so far from my Samsung  Galaxy 10.1. It's happier using high resolutions, 1280 or 1024. The 10.1 is about as small I would want  to go. The icons and controls are very small compared to my fat finger. I finally gave in and bought a stylus.<br />If you're familiar and comfortable using the Windows shortcut keys, life will be easier.<br />I will probably try a bluetooth mouse and perhaps a bluetooth keyboard if I can find a second use for it.<br />The dramatic drop in response time (50% to 75%) reduces its practicallty; but it's great for casual use and monitoring long jobs without being tied to my desk.<br />To my surprise it handled WOL (wake on LAN). So I can power my machine on or off remotely.<br />The use of long press does not always provide a \\"right-click\\". I have not tried access from a remote LAN yet.<br />I'm using the FlexT9 swyping pop up keyboard. Have not tried other options yet.<br />I will add to this post as I bump into pros or cons.
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck's defining masterpiece, Time Out is one of the most rhythmically innovative albums in jazz history, the first to consciously explore time signatures outside of the standard 4/4 beat or 3/4 waltz time. It was a risky move -- Brubeck's record company wasn't keen on releasing such an arty project, and many critics initially roasted him for tampering with jazz's rhythmic foundation. But for once, public taste was more advanced than that of the critics. Buoyed by a hit single in altoist Paul Desmond's ubiquitous \\"Take Five,\\" Time Out became an unexpectedly huge success, and still ranks as one of the most popular jazz albums ever. That's a testament to Brubeck and Desmond's abilities as composers, because Time Out is full of challenges both subtle and overt -- it's just that they're not jarring. Brubeck's classic \\"Blue Rondo &agrave; la Turk\\" blends jazz with classical form and Turkish folk rhythms, while \\"Take Five,\\" despite its overexposure, really is a masterpiece; listen to how well Desmond's solo phrasing fits the 5/4 meter, and how much Joe Morello's drum solo bends time without getting lost. The other selections are richly melodic as well, and even when the meters are even, the group sets up shifting polyrhythmic counterpoints that nod to African and Eastern musics. Some have come to disdain Time Out as it's become increasingly synonymous with upscale coffeehouse ambience, but as someone once said of Shakespeare, it's really very good in spite of the people who like it. It doesn't just sound sophisticated -- it really is sophisticated music, which lends itself to cerebral appreciation, yet never stops swinging. Countless other musicians built on its pioneering experiments, yet it's amazingly accessible for all its advanced thinking, a rare feat in any art form. This belongs in even the most rudimentary jazz collection.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The third book in the trilogy wasn't nearly as good as the other two.  It dragged on and was hard to keep track of a lot of it.  It was as if the author ran out of a good story and just needed to wrap it up.  But, she took way too long to end it.
B0017YZIL4|5.0|As the story goes, Wes would practice his guitar using alternate picking with a guitar pick. However, he started getting complaints about the \\"noise\\" so he began using his thumb so the sound wouldn't bother anyone. After he achieved fame he could play using alternate picking from the callus formed on his thumb. Other jazz musicians named him \\"The Thumb.\\"<br />Additionally he was famous for playing octaves (playing the same note on two different strings at the same time. This, plus the tone of not using a pick, gave him that \\"incredible\\" sound. As a jazz guitarist myself, playing guitar this way is amazing.<br />This is a quartet setting with the great Tommy Flanagan on piano, Percy Heath on bass & Albert Heath on drums. Besides Wes' playing, Flanagan does great solo work, & some beautiful intros. You'll love tunes such as \\"Airgin\\" (Sonny Rollins), \\"West Coast Blues\\" & \\"Gone with the Wind\\", 8 tunes in all. You'll appreciate Wes' chord solos as well.

B000002ADT|5.0|Kind of Blue isn't merely an artistic highlight for Miles Davis, it's an album that towers above its peers, a record generally considered as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence. Why does Kind of Blue posses such a mystique? Perhaps because this music never flaunts its genius. It lures listeners in with the slow, luxurious bassline and gentle piano chords of \\"So What.\\" From that moment on, the record never really changes pace -- each tune has a similar relaxed feel, as the music flows easily. Yet Kind of Blue is more than easy listening. It's the pinnacle of modal jazz -- tonality and solos build from the overall key, not chord changes, giving the music a subtly shifting quality. All of this doesn't quite explain why seasoned jazz fans return to this record even after they've memorized every nuance. They return because this is an exceptional band -- Miles, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb -- one of the greatest in history, playing at the peak of its power. As Evans said in the original liner notes for the record, the band did not play through any of these pieces prior to recording. Davis laid out the themes before the tape rolled, and then the band improvised. The end results were wondrous and still crackle with vitality. Kind of Blue works on many different levels. It can be played as background music, yet it amply rewards close listening. It is advanced music that is extraordinarily enjoyable. It may be a stretch to say that if you don't like Kind of Blue, you don't like jazz -- but it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a cornerstone of any jazz collection.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I tried this book because I enjoyed Way of the Kings. This is a good book however there are predictable outcomes to several situations and the ending was not a surprise to me. This book is a good read however not good enough for me to buy the 2nd one in the series.

B005FITIK0|1.0|Trying to find the narcissist behavior of a faded prom queen/alcoholic funny was a bit of a strain. This was not a comedy, it was a drama.  And aside from the wonderful performance of Patton Oswalt, this film was about a sad and pathetic, 'psycho prom queen' who was beyond deluded about her life and her influence over people.  How anyone could find this funny, when she so obviously is mentally ill? Drinking to excess and obsessively pulling out her hair while ignoring reality, she enters the story a shallow self-involved bitch, and despite touching some humanity, exits in the same condition. Theron was truely beliveable, but that still doen'y make the character worth watching.<br /><br />I have lost two hours of my life I can't get back, so save yourself and skip this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game I love it. its especially great for kids and people who love anything western. its fun and addicting!
B0000060NH|5.0|I've been listening to Marvin Gaye for quite some time. I own several studios albums by this musical genius, but have been missing this gem for quite sometime.<br /><br />Trouble Man, the soundtrack, I a perfect blend of soulful singing & melodic instrumentals. I honest recommend this album to anyone looking to connect with their inner self.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app has the potential to be among the best on Android.  Unfortunately, it us ultimately useless because it doesn't offer encryption.  I love accessing my PC from my Android device.  I HATE sharing all that information over the internet without encryption.<br /><br />Splashtop support has been quite slow to respond.  They still have not added right click support for BT mice even though ICS now supports it.<br /><br />Still, it is light years ahead of other solutions in terms of speed.<br /><br />5 stars with encryption and right click support, one without.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Yes you're building a village like in other games but I find this game strangely addictive.The graphics are beautiful and the bonus Scrat<br />video is hilarious.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I dwnldd for my granddaughter but I ended up playing it more than her. took me a minute to figure out how to close it out on kindle fire but its easy once you know how. I think its fire's fault not the game's; but you may want to look into that (comment is for the techies) . I'm sorry for the haters who are too ignorant or impatient and make all or nothing judgements based on one tiny glitches. I love the graphics and the fact that you can earn coins quickly. its one of my fav games!<br />o
1451673442|5.0|This book has changed my life for the better! It taught me how to fully utilize gratitude in my everyday life and increase the depth of my gratitude. I followed the 28 day plan and have noticed more blessings entering my life. The biggest blessing of using gratitude is that it makes you feel good! Try it yourself... be truly grateful for something and pay attention to how you feel.. that is proof enough that gratitude works.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|I think I would like this game I mean its zombies and samurais but I can not install it at all. I'm using a kindle fir and every time I try to install it. it crashed the device can someone please fix this
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Really good story that this author brought to life so well...made you really care about the characters. Would definitely recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great. personally the only thing I think is wrong with it is how long you have to wait. for stuff.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a New York Times bestselling erotic fiction paperback and e-book by E. L. James. Set largely in Seattle, the trilogy traces the deepening relationship between college graduate Anastasia Steele and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of BDSM. It is also worthy to mention that there are strong elements of Stephanie Myers' Twilight Saga in them.<br />Have I read Fifty Shades ...yes. Is it good ...yes. In good faith I can tell you that it is worth the read. I would go much farther to say that if you are going to choose to read the book, you will need to read all three to under the story. I had a hard time putting them down; I read all three books in a short two day span.  I would also go so far as to give them a four and a half star rating.<br /><br />This book has gained rapid notoriety for the subject matter. That being said, I have been reading Fifty Shades type books for years. I started with A N Roquelaure's Beauty series, and continued in the John Norman's Gor books. I have read every sub genre that romance has to offer, historical, suspense, and paranormal. There are hundreds of romances that have elements of erotica in them. There are many others that also have elements of BDSM in them including J.R. Ward, Shayla Black, Lauren Dane and the list goes on.  What sets these books apart from the norm is the sheer amount of erotica in them (we're talking a sex scene almost every other page).  While it is an erotic novel, I wouldn't go so far as to say that is all these books are about. When you strip away the erotic elements, a reader is left with a quite interesting and heartwarming story, where the hero is deeply scarred and the heroine that surprises you at every turn. This series isn't a literary masterpiece but it can make someone think and most will find a connection with the key characters.  As for the Twilight connection, if you have read the Twilight books you willfind the subtleties as they are there in the ways that the characters interact both with each other and on their own.<br /><br />Fifty Shades is just what it is, an erotic romance. If you can enjoy a mature romance then this would be the book for you. However if you are a fan of the milder genre, then I would suggest ignoring the hype and pass them up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a good game entertaining for hours out of the day very easy to play my nephews really like it
1416955070|5.0|I have read this book several times and enjoyed it each time.  The characters are well developed in a fairly reasonable story for fantasy.
B000LVAQDE|5.0|Great quality for an older movie we couldn't find anywhere else.  My son had been asking to see this movie after he saw the Rocky movies. I am glad we found it here.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were awesome! At the end of  Mockingjay it seemed a touch anti-climactic, but other then that it was spectacular!
1439133948|5.0|This review is for people who never read any books in this series. You can easily start with this one if you choose. This review has one mild spoiler from early in the book.<br /><br />We start by following a man lost underground in the dark, hungry, thirsty, cold, and injured. He is also hallucinating because his kidnappers drugged him before he escaped. It is easy to care for any worry about him, even as we learn he is a powerful and important man on his home planet. He is wildly clever, sometimes too much so, and being inside his head is a fascinating experience.<br /><br />This book is more than just a wonderful adventure story, although there are plenty of fights and a commando raid or two. It is also more than a novel of political intrigue. If you read science fiction, perhaps even if you don't, you have probably heard of cryonics, the attempt to freeze people so they don't age or die of any diseases they have until the cure is discovered and they are awoken. Nobody I have ever read has done a more thorough job of exploring the non obvious consequences and dangers to society of cryonics, should it actually work.<br /><br />If you read this you will learn more about Miles Vorkosigan, but you don't need to absorb much of it to enjoy this novel. You can understand and enjoy this novel just knowing that while he is an important man on his home world, he must be very careful where he is to avoid a diplomatic incident.
0345803485|5.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a friend and decided to give it a try. I am not a reader of erotic fiction so I have no point of comparison for that, but I am an avid reader. This story is engaging and the characters likable. I spent the first few chapters wanting to pick up a red pen and revise some of writing but once i dismissed that I was able to enjoy the book. It was a book I did not want to put down once I started and was able to read all 3 books within 2 weeks.  These are a fun read and although the plot is predictable you find yourself looking forward to a book #4 and seeing where these characters go.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I was a bit apprehensive. I have such fond memories of the Muppets that I did not want anything to tarnish their greatness. This movie is a wonderful blend of the old with the new. They have the same cheesy, happy quips, blended with some good \\"clean\\" humor. I am so glad that I can now share the Muppets with my kids AND my parents. Great Job, Disney.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Took a little time to download wirelessly but I didn't run into any problems at all.  Game play and navigation has worked very well so far. Excellent price for the game.
B0065IA4F2|2.0|I used to like Drake, true story.  And to be fair, there are a couple of catchy songs on this album.  If you dig Drake, well you'd obviously disagree with me, but he's been in the music industry for how long and hasn't done anything new.  He has an annoying voice and writes poor lyrics.  He has an occasional comedic line, and an occasional catchy tune.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I expected this to be good, but it was far above what I had anticipated.  Moving and thought provoking.  In particular, Joseph Mawle's performance was wonderful - subtle and powerful. Richard Madden was fantastic as well.  The only minor flaw I could post was the slow build up in the beginning, but even that was brief and lent itself to the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so excited this game is finally on my kindle fire. I have been waiting forever. Now we just need TempleRun!!
0307593495|3.0|This book was aptly named. Kurt Wallander is so obsessed with his own mortality that the reader finds himself continually diverted from the action to the main character's \\"woe is me\\" internal thoughts about dying, altzheimers, anger toward his daughter, etc.,  etc. This book wasn't even close to the quality of the other Wallander books
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Read this book for book club and it was one of the few books everyone has loved. It gives a unique perspective of this devastating illness from the patient's perspective. A compelling read that will make you think about life and illness and choices you may make in a similar situation.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Everytime I load the app up it gives me an error called Marmalade 5.2.1 or something and says I must free up space, yet I have just about all the space left on my Kindle Fire. Fix this please.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I absolutely love this game but now it wont even turn on for me. when I tap it, a black screen comes up then it goes back to my carousel. help?
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|I chose this as a book club read for my all female group. And it was a perfect choice. Funny, thought provoking and relatable. I found myself wondering how the author knew my deepest thoughts. It gave us all plenty to talk about.  This is a must read for all women.
0307891402|5.0|Worth every penny! This book,... (like the game itself), ... is an investment. As a serious RPG player, I read it just for recreation. It has every answer you could possibly have regarding any mission, armor, etc. It worked out great for me to plan what to do before hand. You will also get a password for a interactive map online. (Very cool) This book is built well and has two built-in page markers.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|&quot;Free&quot; up front but substantially increased difficulty based, not on advancement, but on how much I pay?<br />Sorry, I Don't Support Pay to Play. Period.<br />There's a reason that you don't see arcades anymore. It's because better games exist that can be bought to own.<br /> I'd pay up front to own a good app, but I WILL NOT pay to advance inside a game.
1594744769|4.0|I like it, it has the fantasy aspect to it that I like shrouded in reality of two different decades. The title peaked my interest and the story has captured it. I find it hard to put down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|They finally made this an app for Kindle! Now they need to get temple run on here. Kindle has a long way to go.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so much fun the animation. is so real and unique and I love how therecare so many challenges to do! I can play this game for hours without even noticing!
B004PVKFR8|4.0|About me... Can't stand songs written in a hit factory. Always looking for something different. Something that moves me. I like most genres of music.<br />This album is pretty good. Going through the whole thing, they touch on a lot of different styles. The album has quite a few good songs on it and you are starting to hear more of them making the rounds on broadcast radio, which could be good or could be bad depending on your perspective. Worth buying and I will come back to it again and again over the years.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I'd heard of TinTin but never watched the show nor read the stories. The few reviews I'd read for this film said it was good so I put it in my N'flix queue and wow, how in the world did this fail at the box office. The animation is spectacular. Reminiscent of the old Saturday matinees, it's a thrill a minute but I especially loved the fast witticisms and that Snowy, what a great pooch. This will be a classic.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am enjoying this game very much although I did sacrifice my cash earned on levels to get a better axe:( it does need a way to get items.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved loved loved all 3 books!  It's not for everyone but if you can stand lots of hot hot kinky sex along with a great story you'll love it!  Best of all it has a GREAT ending!! So happy!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been playing Draw Something on my phone until downloaded it today for my Kindle Fire. It was fun before but is awesome now with more screen space :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put these books down!  It is very kinky Hot (not my usual read) BUT it has a great love story and a story that unfolds about the guy you just want to hate but can't.  Worth the read if you don't mind all the sex because there is a lot of it.  After I got over the shock of it I got more into the story and you will too!
B006VA57CY|5.0|The quality of the piture was great and the only time I had buffering was when I was using a connection at a hotel.<br />My wife and I love the series and found the money spent on this was well worth the cost.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read all three in less than a week and now I'm bored stiff with everything else I've picked up since.  Not my usual kind of read but I must say that I really enjoyed the books.  I'm really surprised to read some of the negative reviews.  If you knew what the book was going to be about and it's not your thing why would you read it only to bash it?  At any rate, one thing that stood out for me as I read about this life style is while it isn't for me *SPOILER* it was something they both obviously enjoyed so what? Clearly I've led a sheltered life so I found it fascinating.  It wasn't the HOT HOT sex that kept me reading it was the underlying story of a troubled person that I found most intriguing.  I wanted to hate him but as the layers of history were peeled away you just couldn't hate him and it made you glad he found someone who could put up with him and his baggage.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My inner goddess is telling me I wasted my time & $ on this one. To help save future buyers some cash, here's the story in a nutshell: \\"Holy crap! If Miss Ana bites her lip one more time....er....! That young lady deserves a spanking\\" I say dryly, rolling my eyes. Don't bother.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun game! i got this as the free app of the day but if your Into puzzle games its worth a buck!
B000000H4V|5.0|This album is killer. I dont like a few songs on here, but most of them like Nomad, Territory, and Propaganda are killer tunes. Simply hard and heavy. If you havent heard this album yet and you clame to be a metal head, BUY IT.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Great gift for any hardcore Diablo Fan. He can't decide if he's going to use it or keep it as a collector's item.  Looks just as awesome as the pictures.
B00701QVVY|4.0|It's not as good as Ironbound but for a new release, this album is pretty good. You can definitely rock it to mostly all of their stuff. I like this album and their are some good songs on it. Not my favorite though
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good game. Fast and easy to play. Great to break the boredom of the after school pick up line, waiting rooms, etc.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for any device! I love how easy and quick I can look up Bible verses.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game but I always get annoyed at games where I have to use real $ to buy in game objects.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I need to stop &amp; go to bed lol...ok...one more level before I go...gotta go my maize is ready now
B000I9U9A4|2.0|Soundtrack was great; deep, rich bass and very active surround channels. Visually, the movie was average. The plot was slow moving, repetitive, and essentially anti-climatic. I watched it once then sold it to break even. Rent the movie first.
0345803485|5.0|Hmm, where do I start. I guess I should first say that this book, although not for the prude or faint of heart, is actually a good read. At first I was like, \\"Twilight fanfiction, no thank you!\\" But I did do my research and although it seems that the book developed from Twilight fanfiction, It couldn't be anymore different than Twilight! I've never liked erotic novels or anything that has to do with BDSM but this story just drew me in, and there was always something deeper behind the sexual relationship Christian and Ana shared and something VERY deep behind the personality that Christian has. Of course everyone has their own opinions about these types of stories and it makes sense that so many people hate it. But of course there's the people like me that absolutely loved it! The dialogue definitely got corny and redundant at times, but most of the time I was like, \\"Damn that's pretty hot!\\" I definitely would recommend the free sample be purchased and read before buying the actual book because it really would be a waste of money to those who don't look at this as their cup of tea.<br /><br />I know this is going to get to the point of rambling but I feel like I need to address the Twilight references. I'm not gonna lie, I have read all the Twilight books and at first I seemed to love them when I was younger, but as I got older I realized how much I hated them. So coming from that, and saying that I loved this book is actually a big thing for me! But I respect the power of reading and for those who do like Twilight that is totally fine, books are meant to be an escape so to each his own.  Yes there are some similar themes but the heart of the story is so much different than Twilight, and it's more than just sex and obsession. I look forward to reading the next two books and seeing Ana and Christian's relationship blossom into something more than just the physical :)
B000EPR7NE|5.0|If it has \\"Hans Zimmer\\" anywhere on it, I will probably buy it without question. And this was no exception. Granted I own the movie so I know what I'm buying, but listening to the soundtrack without all the ruckus of the movie interfering makes his music all the more wonderful. You can hear and appreciate everything so much more.
0743289692|5.0|This is an outstanding, well written and riveting book that chronicles the childood, teenage years and adulthood of a Somali woman born into a prominent muslim family.  The painful emotional and physical growth process and struggles of this independent and strong woman are amazing.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Average Beyond Belief - I don't get all the attention this movie got. I see they are up to number 3. This was one of the slowest movies and had some of the most annoying cast I have seen in years. I found myself praying something would happen to the stars.  The first hour is hard to stay awake through. Building a story is one thing, moving at the pace of a slug is another.<br />Believe me this is not a spoiler but there is a scene where the wimpy lead guy gets truly angry and cursed and says something like That's It. I have had it. I am going to do something about this right now. He then proceeds to light a fire in the fireplace. Albeit with anger. Whoa, spirits better watch out. He lit the fireplace...with anger.
B002VE5472|4.0|If it were not for the ending, no I am not going to give anything away, I would have given it 5 stars. Really good whodunnit but I really thought the ending was too contrived.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I love the cinematography, the casting and the costumes. It was a slice of a different time and a different world.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|I pre-ordered the album from the Radiant Records site and was eager to give it a listen. I'm a prog rock fan - Neal Morse and Dream Theater being two of the artists whose music I appreciate - so I was surprised to hear somewhat pop/hard rock sound clips from Flying Colors considering the lineup.<br /><br />I gotta tell you, I was pleasantly surprised with this album. You can tell these guys got together and just had a great time making music. I wouldn't say this album has A definite style, but it is certainly straight forward rock/hard rock. Don't expect many progressive elements to surface (though there are some, such as with the song \\"All Falls Down\\" and the final song, \\"Infinite Fire\\" is quite a bit proggy). You've got elements of hard rock, blues, pop rock, even a touch of 80's rock here and there. You'll even hear Portnoy sing the lead on a doo-wop song (minus the actual \\"doo-wops\\" (thank God))!<br /><br />It feels like Morse, Portnoy, LaRue and Morse all kept their musical virtuoso and technical prowess in check and simply enjoyed making fun, melodic music together. This was actually quite refreshing. On top of this, the vocals are fantastic. I'd never heard of Casey McPherson before, but the guy's voice is great; it's soulful, and his range is impressive. Neal Morse provides some lead vocals here and there within certain songs, but he mostly handles harmonies. Neal's, Mike's, and Casey's voices sound very good together in the harmony parts.<br /><br />The only negative I will add is the lyrics, which aren't the best I've heard/read. They could stand to have spent more time on the lyrics for certain, but the lyrics alone are not reason enough for me not to enjoy the album. I hope Flying Colors is not a one album project. I think these guys have a lot more music in them as a group, and I hope they keep the albums coming.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|The story was good, but the main actor (Chris Evans) was like a cardboard cut out. He was really boring and there was never a sparkle in his eye. He looked like a Ken doll that acted plastic. Boring, no charisma.
B005QMOZOO|1.0|Very disappointed. Incredibly slow and boring. Only made it halfway through the book and had to give up. I have read a lot of P&P sequels and this is by far the worst.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have used this for about five months and I do not regret this purchase. I have had no problems with it and it makes it feel much more safe than the Fire by itself.
0439023521|5.0|I ordered the hunger games from Amazon because it was so much cheaper than in the stores AND with amazon prime, I got free shipping! Cannot beat that!

0439023491|5.0|I think I was one of the last people to jump on the \\"Hunger Games\\" train. I heard mixed reviews and didn't want to waste time on books I thought sounded boring. I also heard the end of the saga was less than awesome. I finally gave in after being dragged to the first movie. Once I picked them up I read all three in three days! I couldn't put them down and I was literally upset there were only 3! They are some of the best books I think I have ever read. They have a wonderful story line, beautifully painted characters, I love the love story/triangle dynamic. I had heard the ending of the trilogy was terrible, which was a huge reason it took me so long to read them. I disagree fully. The end was perfect, maybe a little short. I think it was wrapped up in about 2 pages, so abrupt, yes, but absolutely perfect!

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I bought this application and am quite annoyed that it asks me after every play to rate it. Each time I try to rate it, it bogs down and won't accept my review. Enough already!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a good game to pass spare time away.it is simple and easy to play and understand<br />have fun
B0077ATSU4|5.0|When I see reviews on a movie that has a young actor in the lead role, I usually don't have much hope for a real good film. BUT, I don't understand why Thomas Horn didn't get a nomination for an academy award. He is one fine actor for his age. He basically made this film one that you can't possibly leave for any reason. One perfect movie held together by an EXTREMELY and INCREDIBLY good young actor. Loved It period.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am a fan of romance, I am a fan of Twilight, and even occasionally enjoy a bit of erotica in my reading this was so poorly written and the main characters so lack luster and stock that it was barely readable. I did however push through and finish this painfully repetitive and plot-less drivel that made up this poor excuse for a novel.  Some of the dialogue and situations seemed to come straight from the twilight saga and frankly was not as interesting. Ana and Christian are far from being Bella and Edward in their likability or their love story. How three books was pulled from this is a mystery.
B002IFT1ZA|2.0|I tried watching this show because so many people have compared it to Lord of the Rings. However, that comparison is superficial at best. Like LOTR, the producers of Game of Thrones did a good job recreating Medieval style costumes and scenery. That's about the only similarity.<br /><br />In terms of the plot and characters - what really matters - the two couldn't be more different. LOTR has an epic story of war and morality, with fascinating characters and deep character studies. Game of Thrones, by contrast, seems to be populated by a bunch of losers and whores. I've watched 2 episodes - got too bored to finish - and couldn't detect anything resembling an interesting story. There's a few minutes of mysterious blue-eyed monsters killing people in the first episode (what I thought were lousy special effects), but most of the series seems to focus around the drama of the king's family.<br /><br />Even after 2 hours of watching, I barely remembered any of the characters' names, much less cared about them. Except for Sean Bean's character, they all seem equally annoying. The only point I got excited was when I thought the little girl was going to kill the obnoxious blond kid (alas, she didn't). Unlike Tolkien's Hobbits, the series doesn't have a point of view character who pulls the viewer into the world, making it tough to invest in the characters. This is especially problematic when there are so many characters, most of who fail to make much of an impression.<br /><br />On another note, HBO seems obsessed with sex and violence in its shows. As a matter of artistic preference, I don't have a problem with explicit sex or violence scenes, but only if they serve the story or character development. However, in Game of Thrones, the directors certainly weren't subtle in their cinematography. At times, I felt like I was watching hardcore porno. Much of it seemed thrown in there for the sake of titillating audiences when a far more subtle approach would have served just as well.<br /><br />I haven't read the book so I don't know whether the HBO series is doing it justice. However, I'd warn fans of LOTR and other fantasy classics that they'll likely find Game of Thrones disappointing. It's too bad - with the sort of money HBO has, it has the ability to create a genuine fantasy epic TV show, but instead we get Desperate Housewives in a Medieval setting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have found this weather application to be dependable and empowering when I am headed out the door.  This application saves much in the way of time and effort it can save your peace of mind in knowing just how to dress for the day ahead. Thanks!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|love it, I would suggest this game to anyone.  if you like wave defense games you'll enjoy this game a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finally a book that has romance, sex, and doesn't fit the \\"happily ever after\\" script.  For me this has been a page turner and I love how real the characters are.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The hunger games, the first book, was fantastic. I loved the action and emotion in the story. The whole idea of a twisted government system having 24 tributes fight to the death was very intriguing. I also liked all the characters, they all had a different personality which made the series that much more realistic and interesting. To me after the first book, it slowly went downhill, but it remained to be interesting and emotional the whole way through. The only thing I didn't like was how the epilogue was only one page.. Overall it was a good read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think there are good games but you should have all the  games unlocked.  But it might be fun for others.  thanks.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really did like this app. Checked the weather every day with it. Unfortunately I had it completely lock up my Kindle Fire twice. The only way I could get control back was to wait until the battery went dead. Couldn't even power it off.<br /><br />Note to Amazon - a reset button on the Kindle would be great. That way when something like this happens, you can reset and be back in business again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|haha I like it its fun but some of the games r stupid. but then again all of it is really addicting. :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I would get it it is the best game I have ever played in a long time I would get is if I were you because you can play with all uor friends.
0446572993|4.0|\\"Keep yourself far from a false matter; do not kill the innocent and righteous.\\" -- Exodus 23:7 (NKJV)<br /><br />I enjoyed this thriller by David Baldacci. He manages to add nuances to the usual clich&eacute;s in the genre to craft a different kind of story where a government assassin finds himself facing ethical and emotional issues that he doesn't expect. While it's hardly a deep-character-development novel, Baldacci succeeds in making his characters interesting and attractive enough to keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />While all thrillers are a bit near the top, if not over it, I found that this one contained elements that made it seem more realistic at times than most of the genre. That was due to careful plotting that I admired while reading the book . . . and even more after finishing it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the plot twists were designed to reveal new clues concerning what is really going on.<br /><br />If you've liked any earlier David Baldacci books, I think you'll like this one.<br /><br />The book begins by establishing the solitary work of Will Robie in getting rid of the bad guys under difficult circumstances. After you are well into that, he comes to a hit that surprises him . . . and leads to some unexpected events. In the course of those events, he meets a runaway girl who attracts his protective instincts. In a role reversal, he ends up trying to look out for her while taking care of his own precarious business. It makes for some amusing scenes and sequences that humanize the thriller and increase its appeal.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loved this game. I had no issues with the gameplay and I like going back and attempting to beat my previous scores.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|fun game but could use more instructions instead of having to guess what to do and could be longer.<br />&quot;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|way good app I enjoy this game with all the things you can do as in watch movies play mini games etc
B007SYWFRM|1.0|got an expansion and then it took my money and the expansion disappeared! then i go to customer care and they want sooooooo much info from you including your phone number it was so time consuming i said forget it and deleted the app! this has many issues which is too bad because it is a cute game.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Great product. Love the coral color. I will most likely buy another for my sister who also has a Kindle Fire.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a must play...any body who plays it will love it download kit and give it a shot I'm sure u will like it as much as I do
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to play and build up your town.  enjoy seeing how it can grow. recommend it to anyone who wants to play it.
B007704HO6|5.0|Very easy reading but well written. Lovely story about a cat who transforms it's adopted owner's life. A must read for all animal lovers especially cat owners who will well understand the sentiments expressed.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a very good movie to know the basics about Vietnam, it is also good if you like war history, or just to watch a blow 'em up smash 'em up type of movie. I won't give anything away but there is some parts where someone with a weak stomach shouldn't watch or a very young child. Overall I think it is a great movie and I would buy it again.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I work as a chef and the ability to write and have acess to my recipies on the go and with multiple devices is invaluble. the ability to organize dishes by category into different notebooks is great. I highly recommend this app.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fun and fast reading but does the author have to use words that most people have to look up. I love to learn the meaning of new words, but becomes obnoxious on every page there is a word you have to find a definition for
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok for killing time. some of the games are hard whole others are super easy. doesn't require much thought to play
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book was so-so-so good!  I enjoyed it so much that I had to continue with book #2 and #3.  I loved that Christian Grey character.  A great fantasy!
0316067601|5.0|I just read \\"A SEA STORY\\" by Joseph Pignataro and dove right into Marcus's book. The things our Navy men do are absolutely inspiring. These two books are great testiments to our nations bravest.  I wish he got more into his family life struggle as Sea Story did ontop of all the action. GREAT BOOK!
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ,very disappointed .i had high hopes going in being a big carano and sodenmeyer fan
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a cute and fun game reminds me of super Mario brothers I like it though it doesn't have a down button I thought I could go down those tree trunk things
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first book by Suzanne Collins that I have read and I could not put it down.  The images that pop into your head as you read her words are as vivid as watching a movie.  The story is also a stunning picture of government tyrany as well.  All in all  a great read.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its cool Til it freezes up. I had to start over. would've got 5 stars if not for that. its cool though
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found the characters extremely annoying. Anastasia a weak and non intelligent female character that disgusted me.  Christian a male chauvinistic controlling pig.  The sex scenes went on for pages...I found myself scanning the words and flipping page after page just to get to some interesting dialect. I couldn't finish this book.  I'm surprised this trilogy is so popular!!!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is very entertaining. It will get your adrenaline pumping, and get you laughing occasionally to relieve the tension. The best Brad Bird movie since The Incredibles. As an added bonus, you get to see Jeremy Renner's acting skills put to the test before he takes on the role of the newest character in Marvel's Avenger's Hawkeye. If you are a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, this movie tied it all together. But I won't spoil the surprise! (Be careful, though, because the other reviewers might find it \\"impossible\\" to allow you to enjoy the greatest \\"mission\\" of all time.)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|please fix timer glitches!!! awesome game if it can be fixed!!! do you guys really care what we write in these reviews? a lot of us have complained about the timer glitches please fix for a 5 star rating!!!!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Great experience reading one of my favorite book on Kindle. Enjoyed it completely. Looking forward to reading other books on Kindle.:)
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, very well made. One mano problem is the energy system, you run out way too fast and you either have to wait or buy more with RL money or wait 3 minutes per point. I would be tempted to use the cash shop for the other items, but I wont simply out of principle because of the energy system, this is free-to-play done wrong...
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great game! It definately was challenging and hard to figure out sometimes. But when you keep looking and exploring you will find what you need. I did use the hint guide a few times to get me un-stuck. Really enjoyed it. Thanks.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My wife and I bought this book and read it together.  Very happy that we did.  When you read the different \\"languages\\" it answers soooooo many questions on, although we had a good marriage, what was keeping our marriage from being GREAT!  This has been a step in the right direction!
0345803485|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and learned so much that I did not know about life and love.<br />I aw a widow that was married 38 years before losing my husband - this book opened my<br />eyes about a lot of things I never knew.
0439023521|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie with my daughter, and I really enjoyed it.  I've read over some of the negative reviews and I do think there are some things we have to keep in mind while evaluating this work.<br /><br />1.  This is a book written for teen agers.  Therefore, we shouldn't expect it to be extremely deep, nor should we expect the writing to be beautifully crafted fair.  Collins isn't going to be confused with Faulkner or Shakespeare.  But that's OK, because most of us hated reading those authors in Jr. High and High School.  Collins's book is designed to give that demographic something to read and enjoy, which is most important to getting someone hooked on reading.<br /><br />2.  A lot of people are saying that this book is a rip off of Battle Royale.  I haven't read that book yet (I am not a large consumer of fiction).  I do have to point out that Battle Royale was not, I believe, written for the teenage demographic.  I'll also point out that just about everything has in fact been done before.  Stephen King in fact said that Battle Royale had a lot of similarities to Running Man.<br /><br />OK, onto the review.  THere are probably going to be some spoilers here (although, if you are reading reviews on Amazon, you should probably expect to see a couple, so no use whining about them).<br /><br />For a quick picture of what this book is, cross 1984 with Gladiator and Survivor.  Really, the 1984 themes just ran strongly through the book.  The book is a fast paced read, with quick sentences and a cliff hanger at the end of every chapter which makes you want to keep going.  THe imagery is really good as Collins takes the time to describe things in detail.<br /><br />I won't do a synopsis of the story as you have probably already are aware of it (or can read Wikipedia).  I will just point out a few of the reoccuring themes of the book.<br /><br />1.  Food.  Food is constantly talked about - every meal is described in detail.  Despite the obvious titlereference, I think food is such an ever present force because it is used as a weapon against the people of the districts, but also it is the source of Katniss's power - had she not been a hunter, she never could have survived long enough in the games to have won.  She understood how to live in the wild without the help of others - the lack of this skill lead to the death of at least one of her opponents, and weakened several others.<br /><br />2.  Selflessness and Selfishness.  Katniss was willing to sacrifice herself to save her sister - Peeta was willing to sacrifice himself ot save Katniss.  However, the were too selfish to sacrifice eachother, despite what it would mean going forward.  Also, Haymitch's constant drinking was a shield to protect him from getting to know people that he knew were ultimately going to die in the slaughter.  And, of course the people of the Capitol, with their obliviousness to the country at large and their shallow focus on trite things like fashion while the gross majority of the country was being systematically starved to death.  ALso, Rue's exposure of herself to Katniss was an unselfish act, as her strategy was all about avoiding being seen.<br /><br />3.  Resources.  The arena really pits the \\"haves\\" versus the \\"have nots\\" - the disticts that prepare their tributes for the games versus those that do it unwillingly.<br /><br />4.  The power of a narrative.  Both the Capitol and the DIstrict 12 team want to shape the correct narrative to survive.  The Capitol one of all consuming power that would be pointless to oppose, and the team one of love and commitment that would be overly cruel to destroy.<br /><br />Lastly, you do have to suspend some disbelief while reading this.  A rudimentary understanding of supply chains and economics would certainly tell you that a contry like Panem could not really exist.  Almost all fiction requires a suspension of reality (that's why it is fiction after all).  Just sit back and enjoy it.<br /><br/>I'll close this long - and perhaps not very good - review by just saying, read the book.  The odds of you enjoying it are ever in your favor.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I heard about this book on Good Morning America.  They said womens book clubs are all reading it. That was all I really knew about the book. I started reading it and liked it right away. I have to say, as I got more into the book some parts were hard to read.  I felt like I should not be reading this book... YET I could not put it down. It really is a love story. Some parts seemed \\"dirty\\" to me. That might be because its not the type of book I read.
1455508977|5.0|this is a well told story and looking forward to seeing the movie. this is a well told story and looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00200K2UG|5.0|I agree with everyone else here.  This bag holds an amazing amount of equipment and makes it easy to get to.  The only drawback is that fully loaded this bag is very heavy (perhaps too much stuff).  Nevertheless the best way to overcome this is to get a luggage rack with wheels.  The bag has a zipper on the bottom of the back side to enable you to insert the bag over the rack (you do lose the rear pocket for manuals though)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book arrived in great shape.  I certainly enjoyed reading the historic/novel about the beginning of WWI and the 20th century.  I look forward to the rest of the series.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|Fans of Lacuna Coil will enjoy this cd very much. Its a very solid release from the band.  They really tread no new ground here.  So if you are expecting something very different from the typical LC sound then you will be disappointed.  If you are not a Lacuna Coil fan, then you will not be converted with \\"Dark Adrenaline\\".  The best tracks are:<br /><br />Trip the Darkness  - No wonder it was the lead single.<br />Give Me Something More<br />Upsidedown<br /><br />They also do a decent version of the old REM classic \\"Losing My Religion\\".  Having already covered Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", you know these guys love their early Nineties alternative music.<br /><br />This is a very good album but I wish the band would experiment a little on the next album. I like surprises when they are good.
1439190275|5.0|I got my book in good condition and in a timely manner.  All was good!  there is not much else to say but I guess it has to be 20 characters long.
B0063GORYU|5.0|OMG I love it. this is the best game ever! when I win I feel so good. oh, wait, I always win. I love who ever made this game. Xo Xo Xo Xo Xo Xo Xo
B001U7B4T8|1.0|I agree with the previous reviewers.  When you see the big finale number where everybody is on stage at the end, you can spot about 9 people on the stage whose individual performances were not even included.  I waited all these years to see that performance of Johnny Winter doing \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" again, but that was left off, apparently so they could include 15 minutes of people booing Sinead OConnor.<br /><br />On top of that, the video and audio quality on this DVD is more like muddy VHS.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book...actually makes us think about how big our government is now and how this can happen if we don't get our government out of our lives.  I could not put the books down...read every day excited to see what was going to happen next.  Recommend this and then go see the movie and then vote our current government out of office.  WE THE PEOPLE do not want to become like the book....wow...such a great purchase.
B007ARJF6G|4.0|fast new in wrapper love it ,  for the price and shipping it was worth it , im a hugh madonna fan , so i had to make sure i got this one for my collection,
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|Same issue than APerotti:<br />The package arrived in perfect condition,but after 10 min on my wrist the watch stopped...<br />If I don't wear it, it is all fine, if I wear it, after 10, 30 min or 1h the watch freeze...<br />I wanted to give it a try but Don't Buy Invicta...
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is exactly what I was looking for; and arrived exactly as it was described. Shipping was fast! No problems with the camera or side buttons. Love it.
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|This is the way horror films used to be. When there wasn't a sliced torso or a gouged eyeball every few minutes, filmmakers relied upon the viewers' imagination to fill in the dark places. They knew that what we didn't see what scarier than what they could show us. Ti West knows this and fills most of The Innkeepers with our imagination. If you want an ADHD roller coaster of gore and action, go watch Final Destination 5 or whatever the latest Saw movie was. If you enjoy your horror with a slow build-up of suspense and creepiness, The Innkeepers is for you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. however it fan be frustrating at times. the first week I played it, it froze up a lot. and sometimes I can't get my friends page to load no matter how many times I restart it. but all in all a very fun and addicting game.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|item was delivered on time.great mixer for controlling different inputs on your music system.mixer was use at a small house party and worked excellent for adjusting mic levels and sound (music) levels good value for the price and will recommend to anyone starting up a small dj system.

0452273331|4.0|Loved most of this book. There were preachy-philosophical moments but overall it was an everyman-type book. Highly recommend reading Ayn Rand. Felt like my eyes were opened to new aspects of humanity.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is an enchanting read.  I have come to the end of the story, and want it to begin again.  Morgenstern's writing weaves fanciful images that haunt my daydreams.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|its entertaining and fun makes me chuckle. good time killer.  I love all samarui games.  rock on glue fwctoryddd ffft odoriferous kdkfk
B003O86FMW|4.0|A decent continuation of The Hunger Games, particularly in the first half. The second half feels a little too much like The Hunger Games 2, except with a bigger budget, weirder special effects, and too little time to develop the situations and characters. Peeta continues to be incapable of any selfish emotions--come on, Peeta, you're human, right? Collins, tell me he's not some mutt programmed for self-loathing and constant romantic-target adoration? This book treads close to admiring-pretty-boy-harem territory, too, with the addition of Finnick, but it manages to squeak by without quite falling into that pit.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I was told by a teacher that I needed to read this series, I was so disappointed with it.  There really isn't much that happens to keep me involved, people/kids get picked to kill each other, the end!!!  So I thought I would stick with it anyway, and am now half way through the second book, it's the same exact story as the first book, even with the same people going in to kill each other. SERIOUSLY!!  I will not read the third book, this was such a waste of money.  How did this ever become a movie?
B0007P0LPC|5.0|I am partisan to Fonteyn and Nureyev so there's nothing negative I can or will say about their art. This is real classical ballet an enjoyment for the whole family.

B0060YIBLK|5.0|If you need a book to teach you, your employees, your kids, your spouse or any of your team members how to communicate and build rapport with ANYONE, this is the book!  I have read many, many books on relating to others, building sales skills, improving interpersonal communication and developing connections with people.  Although they all had something positive to take away, none were an easy, quick read.  This book provides the techniques you can immediately put into practice.  Its easy to carry with you, in print or Kindle, for quick review.  I personally carry it with me and review key elements before meetings or interacting with someone for the first time.<br /><br />The author has a fun, easy style of writing and doesn't waste time talking about himself, unless he is relating a personal experience.  Probably because its not about him.  ;-)<br /><br />If you are a sales manager or team leader, this is the perfect book to hand out to your team members at retreats or conferences.<br /><br />Great book!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy this app every day. works great! loaded without a problem and has run flawlessly ever since. I run it on a Kindle Fire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading science fiction since I was 10 years old (a long time ago).<br /><br />Reading this book reminded me of those days when I would grab a flashlight, put the cover over me, and read until the wee hours of the morning.<br /><br />Very intriguing.  Just couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  I was immersed in the context of the book.  Better than the Hunger Games.<br /><br />I could easily see these books becoming a movie or television series.

B007BLDFWG|1.0|The acting in this film is actually pretty decent, however, the story is a total dud. I think that pretty well sums it up.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|Richard Dawkins knows nothing about my religion, or about the God I believe in, and he distorts, twists, exaggerates, slanders, and hides the evidence that would give people an honest perspective on what religious belief actually is. As many have recognized, he creates the classic strawman to beat up in order to make his arguments more convincing. For an intelligent person, this instead shows Dawkins to be insecure and unable to fight fairly. This also made me smell a rat from page 1.<br /><br />Yes, the religious people Dawkins appears to believe in, if any actually are as stupid as the ones he describes, which I suppose is possible, are deluded.<br /><br />Those of us who make up the vast majority of religious people who can see Dawkins for the liar and hypocrite that he clearly is, are not.<br /><br />Dawkins' religion, atheism based on naturalism, requires just as much faith as any other. The difference between Dawkins and honest believers, however, is that honest believers in truth don't have to lie to make their points. Those of us who are honest are willing to follow where the truth leads, and we don't need to tear others down to build ourselves up. Those of us who are honest seekers of truth do not need to ridicule and attack other people's beliefs to make money and make ourselves feel better.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|The game overall is fun. The problem is the user interface is very poorly constructed and ut is nearly impossible to have all your ingredients in the window at the same time once you get a good collection going. It's not fun that way ... uninstalling, sorry.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I normally don't review books but this was so bad I just had to. Unless you read plain Vanilla romance this is not erotica. It is a PG-13 version of \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" dumbed down for those that missed the movie in the 80's.<br /><br />The writing was horrible. The same phrases over and over.(Inner Goddess anyone?) Plus, the heroine was just naive beyond belief for a college student. Also, the author uses British phrases like \\"Pram\\" instead of stroller and has the father watching Soccer. Details like this can ruin a book. Where was the editor? The sex scenes are not imaginative or hot.One is almost a total rip off of a scene from \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" just watered down. Additionally, she does the BDSM community a huge dis-service. A little research would have been nice. Never is the attraction of this lifestyle for the participants explained beyond him being a control freak or aftercare mentioned.<br /><br />There are so many really good books on this subject with great stories that you should not waste time on this one. Try Maya Banks \\"Sweet\\" series if you want a good story. Or just rent \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" and enjoy Mickey Roarke doing some really hot things.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I would like to preface this by stating that my sons have owned MANY headsets in the past, so they know all about headsets. Now that we have that established let's talk about this headset. The comfort of these is by far the best they've ever experienced (even though they look heavy), you almost forget they are on your head they are that comfortable! I have tested these with skype, Google talk, ventrilo, teamspeak, etc... And they work amazingly on all of them, My favorite part of all has to be the programmable keys. On itunes and windows media player these \\"G keys\\" as they are called can be set to skip, pause/play, rewind, etc... among other things. I have two of the three keys set to \\"Bass up\\" and \\"Bass\\" down which is very useful. Battery life on these actually lasts the time they say they do (unlike most things you buy now days) and  they recharge very fast! Microphone quality is also amazing and the overall build of this is very sturdy. I just can't say enough how good this is, I strongly urge you to get these if you have the money and enjoy listening to music and playing games! BEST headset I have ever owned! My son says it's really cool when you have the bass set high during Battlefield Bad Company 2 & you can feel the expolsions & gunfire while playing. Not so sure it's great for the inner ear set that high but he sure was smilin....I'll be monitering his use in the future!

0060254920|1.0|Poor Max - he is a normal child who melts down once in a while but then is unfairly punished for his age-appropriate behavior.  It is unhealthy to give our children the message that being upset is equivalent to being naughty and bad. This view forces Max to split off his upset feelings as \\"wild things\\" that are alien to him. For a contrasting message in which a child is lovingly helped by his parents to understand and accept the upset feelings that cause bad dreams, see Mommy, Daddy, I Had a Bad Dream!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|One of the better games I've played, would recommend it to all asian kids around the world... And maybe some crackers, not beaners though. Thanks glu
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome writing. Hugh - your writing gets better with every volume. I bought #1, then had to buy #2 and so on... Great characters. Great story. The only downside to this book is that you can't put it down. Just finished #6 and the story really turns the corner nicely to hard scifi post-apocalyptic bliss. Wow.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I read many articles about this film, mostly negative; still I watched it ... and surprisingly, I enjoyed it from the beginning until the end.  Good acting, good story, very entertaining.
1440503257|4.0|Definitely not a must have for Harry Potter fans, but it's full of fun and even some traditional English recipes, from steak and kidney pudding to classic British pies to bread and biscuit and breakfast recipes.<br /><br />The chapters have fun names:<br />1*Good Food with Bad Relatives<br />2*Delights Down the Alley<br />3*Treats from the Train<br />4*Recipes from a Giant and an Elf<br />5*The Favorite Cook's Dishes<br />6*Breakfast Before Class<br />7*Lunch and Dinner in the Dining Hall<br />8*Deserts and Snacks at School<br />9*Holiday Fare<br />10*Treats in the Village<br /><br />Some of the Recipes included:<br />Petunia's Pudding, Paddington Burgers, Pumpkin Juice, Harry's Chocolate Layer Cake (from his 11th birthday), Treacle Fudge, Kreacher's French Onion Soup, Molly's Meatballs with Onion Sauce, Yorkshire Pudding, Haggis!, Homemade Marshmellows, Stewed Tripe and Onions, Eggnog for Kids, Goulash, Acid Drops, different flavours of Honeydukes Treats, and even ice cream recipes.<br /><br />At the beginning of each chapter is a paragraph introducing the recipes and talking about how they relate to the Harry Potter series, which I really enjoyed reading. And each recipe contains a short description of the dish and where you can find it mentioned in the series, giving the book name and the chapter. Unfortunately, there is no recipe for butterbeer. *sigh* Hence why I deducted a star. How can you have a Harry Potter cookbook without butterbeer?<br /><br />The other downside: a lot of these recipes require a lot of prep time and some of them a lot of cooking time. I think it's best used as a group activity where everyone can work together and enjoy making and later eating some of the food mentioned in the series.<br /><br />But really, even if you don't plan on firing up the old oven, it's still fun to read through the chapters and read the descriptions of everything. A lot of them you'll remember from the books right away.

0345803485|1.0|I downloaded the book having seen it ranked among some of my favorite fantasy books... figured it was another awesome trilogy I could start.  Yeah... NO!  The writing alone is AWFUL and would have made me stop reading, but I figured I'd give the \\"story\\" a shot.  Story?  what story?  This book is all about S&M.  So it's a terribly written book with a barely formed plot about S&M.  God, people will read ANYTHING, won't they?
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I've been running this processor for about a month now, and I've had no issues with it what so ever.  Good piece if not a bit on the expensive side.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read book one and two of this trilogy so far. I was hooked from the beginning, and can't wait to download book three. I also can't help wondering who will play Christian Grey if they make this into a movie. Whenever I see an actor I think to myself: \\"Hmmm, could he pull it off?\\" There's not many who could! Laters, baby.

0307279189|5.0|This book is fantastic.  One of my top 5 of all time, and I read fairly widely.  The paperback version is nice as it's great for gift-giving.  I have given this book to several friends and relatives now, and everyone agrees it's amazing.<br /><br />If you're a runner, an athlete, a doctor, a podiatrist, an anthropologist, or just an interested, active human being --- you should read this book.

B007HO392S|5.0|Wow! This is a fantastic fourth CD release by the fourth season Idols winner & country music superstar Carrie Underwood titled 'Blown Away'. She thinks it's her best album yet and I agree : wonderful 14 track compositions (she co-wrote eight of fourteen tracks in 'Blown Away' CD), incredible production by Mark Bright (beautiful multi-layered melodic musical instruments) & great vocals. Carrie Underwood, a native of Oklahoma sings about small town living, fragility of life, love & more in this release. You'll be 'Blown Away' by this album, she is really on top of her game. The album has a good mix of up-tempo tracks as in \\"Good Girl\\", \\"Blown Away\\", \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" & \\"Cupid's Got Shotgun\\", ballads as in \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\", \\"Forever Changed\\" & \\"Wine After Whiskey\\", the 'edgy/hunky-tonky' as in \\"One Way Ticket\\" & \\"Leave Love Alone\\" & mid-tempo tracks as in \\"See You Again\\", \\"Do You Think About Me\\" & \\"Good In Goodbye\\". Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\", \\"See You Again\\" (wonderful harmonies), \\"Do You Think About Me\\"(great banjo guitar sound), \\"Forever Changed\\" (wonderful orchestral/piano base track), \\"Thank God For Hometowns\\" (beautifully layered base track & melodical guitars), \\"Good In Goodbye\\", \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" & \\"Who You Are\\" (this is my favourite track from this incredible CD with 8 stand-outs out of 14 tracks). Great tracks include \\"Good Girl\\", \\"Blown Away\\", \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\", \\"One Way Ticket\\" & \\"Leave Love Alone\\". Okay track is \\"Cupid's Got Shotgun\\" for me.<br /><br />On overall, Carrie Underwood has released an incredible fourth CD that will blow you away (compositions, production & vocals). She needs to creat space in her cabinet for accalades & awards that may be on her way following this release. A well deserved 5 star performance & a highly recommended CD listening!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It's trash but it's an easy read. I read the whole series over a few days. It's certainly not as good as the hype suggests
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is very addicting.  even with only the free items it can be pretty challenging in the upper 30 waves.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Very atmospheric book: has a gothic horror feel to it at times, along with the magic. Written in a nonlinear style. Many of the characters are difficult to like, to trust. The circus mood did not alleviate the tragedies, rather the contrast in fantasy wonder and evil made each more vivid. But this technique, I thought, was well done. I very much enjoyed the book. It was unique and creative. And by the end of the story, I was pleased with our heroes and heroines.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Simple, human, and very emotional. Early Takes, Volume 1 is an extreme close-up of George Harrison. It's a conversation between the listener and the quiet Beatle. It simply couldn't be any better. And it's better than the 'more produced' versions of Harrison songs you're already familiar with. I love it.  You'll appreciate the songs more than you do already.  It's a George Harrison CD that really shines a light on George Harrison as a composer, a musician and a person.

B005PMNBNG|5.0|This is by far M83's best album so far. This album not only contains excellent single songs like New Map and Midnight city but it is even better when listened to as a whole. I listened to this whole album all the way through while driving down to South Carolina and it sounded amazing. As Anthony Gonzalez stated about the album its like an invisible soundtrack to a movie. Great Album overall and it has 24 songs! Definitely a great buy.

B004ZY0VHY|2.0|One of the most depressing books I have ever read. I had such high hopes from this book as a mother of a child with a behavior disorder, I hoped it would be a book that I could identify with the main character. NOT. I felt like I needed to call a depression hot line after the final page. Pass the prozac, please.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This was the first Marian Keyes book I read. It truly is the funniest book ever. I have my hardcopy wore out so I just both the ebook.

Was going to keep them for my holidays but am half way through book 2 already. They are very erotic, thrilling and unputdownable (if thats a word) with a beautiful love story entwined.
B007BRJYF2|2.0|The story text is annoying as is very choppy and required multiple clicks to get through.  would prefer to have an option to skip text.  The puzzle games are biginner level and very boring.  I did enjoy the majority of the search options and found them quite challenging. The level of the search portion does not match the rest of the application.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was just going to go and see the film but I am so glad now that I decided to read the book instead. Brilliant story, keeps you on the edge throughout. Just bought the 2nd and 3rd book and am really looking forward to reading them.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Fun app!  The story text on the app could have been reduced and not sure what the rationale is for the TV reporter (seems like a waste of MBs).  I enjoyed the hidden object games and how each of the scenes tied in with one another.  A game you can play  more than once!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Shinedown's Amaryllis album is fantastic!!  I have only downloaded their songs prior to this album, but it's so great, I bought the CD!!  Inspirational and uplifting lyrics and awesome music!!  Definitely recommend it!!
B007IE4DSG|5.0|First these are demos and early out takes so have to rate these songs for what they are. It's neat to see how George worked thru these songs and how they sound in a raw form also the songs are very clear, the only thing I did not like was bass on some of the songs were to loud I had to turn it down a bit to keep the bass from taking over the songs, Let it be me, was is the prize song on the cd George sang this song just right almost sounds like he was going to us it on one of his lps but ended up dropping it, What a shame. My sweet lord is another stand out avery nice tune, well I can keep going so if you what something fresh this is it:-)
B007PBL9KC|4.0|Of Monsters and Men prove to be a perfect example of a group getting hit with too many comparisons to too many bands and, in the process, causing a watering down and misinterpretation of those bands they are being compared to.  To say they're like Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes because they have the occasional choral shout of \\"Hey!\\" and similar horn flourishes (and the fact that you can sing the lyrics to \\"Home\\" during the instrumental segues in the opening track, \\"Dirty Paws\\") is to forget why Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes produced a memorable record.  Namely, they brought forward a charismatic front man and a fascinating back story, then paired that with hippy, New Age Jesus lyricism and chorus sing-alongs.  But *those* chorus sing-alongs fed into the meaning and nature of the Love Each Other music and message of the album.  Of Monsters and Men are really just using a popular musical trope.<br /><br />Just because they have a driving drum beat and a build to their songs does not mean they have the dystopian suburban lyrics and energy that made Arcade Fire such a hit.  Comparing them to Mumford & Sons just defies all reason, unless having more than one vocalist instantly makes something Mumfordesque.  Plus, the male vocals don't have nearly the level of character and emotion that Marcus Mumford's seared rasp conveys.<br /><br />Given all the things that they're *not*, I'm left wondering what exactly Of Monsters and Men *are* as a band.  Any album that draws so many varied but only slightly relevant comparisons can't be considered groundbreaking, and \\"My Head Is An Animal\\" definitely isn't doing anything particularly new.  That being said, it does what it does well.<br /><br />With lyrics ranging from magical animals to mystical nature, they bring a bit of Icelandic wilderness sensibility to the conventional sound of what must be called indie arena music.  The two main singers, Nanna and Raggi, have fairly innocuous voices that wind in and out of the instrumentation without ever overpowering it.  Nanna sounds a bit like an un-diva'd version of Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine, while Raggi provides an airy but very-slightly-lower toned version of Sigur Ros's Jonsi, only stripped of most of the Icelandic accent.  They're well-matched in this setting, allowing the music to showboat while they float around it.  The song writing is catchy and can be both memorable and inspiring at times.<br /><br />This is, without doubt, a *good* album.  We cannot, however, in all fairness compare it to albums that were, and are, great.
B000003TB6|4.0|My order came today and i'm listening to this album for the first time while writing this review. 4 songs in and i'm head boppin' and toe tappin like a lunatic! It is so good, definitely jazzy and chill.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I was surprised that I enjoyed this book, and in fact the series.  However, I do enjoy a good crime drama and this is in that same genre.  I read all three books and would very much recommend them, although I did read them out of sequence.  I am glad that I found these books and will read them again on my Kindle.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|I was so looking forward to this movie, but it was not at all what I expected!  Taught me to wait to order until I can pre-view it on cable if I am not sure.  Great cast, but VERY disjointed.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a fast moving story. Although the main culprits were predictable and the tie in at the end was not the greatest, it was a great read. Julie the 14 yo street educated teenager pretty much stole the show for me. She was not the main character (or was she)but she made the story. Look forward to the next Baldacci novel.<br /><br />Maybe expand on Robie making sure Julie is safe while continuing to work for the US.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|I don't pretend to be a sophisticated movie-goer, and I certainly don't pass myself off as a sophisticated movie critic.  I've now watched both the American and Swedish versions of the film and each certainly have their strengths and weaknesses, but it's really pointless to compare/contrast them.  I thought this Hollywood version was - for the most part - faithful to the book given the time constraints.  There were a few minor deviations, but nothing worth whining about.  One thing I definitely thought was outstanding about Hollywood's version was Daniel Craig's portrayal of Mikael Blomkvist; much more entertaining than his Swedish counterpart.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed reading the book.  Couldn't wait to turn the next page.  When I finished the book, I ordered the remaining two books in the series.
B002LC8HF0|2.0|One must really give props to Brandon Sanderson, the man simply has a natural talent for writing very compelling fantasy. His first two Mistborn novels were proof of this, he created a fascinating world with an interesting mythology and an intriguing magic system. Above all else, he can make characters in a fantasy setting seem believably real, which is something many authors stumble with. While unfamiliar with his other works, his Mistborn novels, particularly The Final Empire and The Well of Ascension, escalated Sanderson to one of my most revered authors. Which is why it's so surprising that I dislike the finale, Hero of Ages to such a degree. It's not that the book itself is bad, its just such a drastic step down from the previous two in storytelling, characters, and overall design. Mistborn fans should definitely read it for closure on the trilogy, but it personally left me disappointed.<br /><br />It's been a long and hard existence for Vin and the remainder of Kelsier's gang of thieves. They overthrew a tyrannical overlord who fancied himself a god. Then they faced down the vast armies of invading warlords while dealing with their own internal political conflicts. Now they face the greatest threat imaginable: Ruin, a malevolent supernatural being that seeks to destroy everything and everyone. Releasing him has done more than just ensure their demise, it has torn their very world apart. The once subtle ash rains now come in downpours, quenching any plant and wildlife while the mists attack and kill those less fortunate. If they are to survive this apocalypse, Emperor Elend Venture and his wife Vin Venture must rally their forces and secure as many alliances and supplies as they can. All the while searching for any last hope of ending Ruin from the Lord Ruler's ancient research, while Ruin himself manipulates everything from behind the scenes.<br /><br />I'll begin with what Hero of Ages does right, though the pros unfortunately don't outweigh the cons. For one, as the final act in a trilogy, Hero of Ages does exactly what a conclusion should do, which is provide closure to the story and its various characters. Every mysterious oddity in the world is thoroughly explained in a believable manner that'll leave you satisfied, such as the planet's unnatural state, particularly explanations for the ashmounts and a red sun. The various creatures like the kandra, the kolloss, the inquisitors, and the mysterious origin of all three mystic arts: Allomancy, Feruchemistry, and the newly introduced Hemalurgy, these are all elaborated upon. While everything is explained, Sanderson wisely left a few small tidbits which will indefinitely be brought to light in the upcoming sequels. But Sanderson doesn't cheat the reader, this is the definitive ending of the Mistborn trilogy, you won't find any cheap cliffhanger ending to force you into the next book.<br /><br />Props must also be given to the story FINALLY LEAVING LUTHADEL! That metropolitan city was a fantastic setting for the high-flying stunts and political intrigue that made the previous novels so entertaining to read, but after over a thousand pages taking place there it's very refreshing to stretch our legs and see the rest of the world. It's here that Sanderson once again pulls the reader into his world with such intricate details that would have made for otherwise inconceivable imagery. The world is being suffocated by a never-ending rain of ash, yet with Sanderson's knack for detail, he creates a mesmerizing sense of beauty to the destruction. There's an oddly welcoming sense of poetic bliss to the eternal blackness, if this would be the way we die, then it would be a peaceful way to see the end of all things.<br /><br />Yet these were the only real positives I could muster about this book. Perhaps my disapproval is due to just how incredible the first two were, especially The Well of Ascension, a book I claimed to be one of the best fantasy novels that I've ever read. My critiques are an amalgam of various issues, ones that The Final Empire and even more so with The Well of Ascension didn't suffer from at all, which makes their appearance in Hero of Ages all the more jarring. These malefactors focus on the use of characters and the book's structure which differs greatly from the establish formula that Sanderson had utilized to this point. In the previous Mistborn novels, Sanderson created a truly absorbing narrative that felt like a roller coaster ride that pulled the reader in and wouldn't let go to the very end. This was accompanied by a very strong group dynamic from several very well-realized characters, each with differing personalities which created compelling discourse among the group. The problem in Hero of Ages is the group's separation due to the book's second issue: the split nature of the overall structure. Where The Final Empire and The Well of Ascension had a single cohesive narrative that involved every individual, the layout of The Hero of Ages is quite different. The story arcs merge, separate, and then some are dropped while others continue. There is a positive side to this, for it broadens the scope of the story and shows us the stakes are unimaginably high. Yet this shift in direction didn't have the same pull that invested me in the previous two novels. Where they each had masterfully illustrated storylines that kept the reader on the edge of their seat, Hero of Ages is very slow-paced with several uneven story arcs that create a very disjointed overall feel. It's quite ironic really that the previous entry which was about a city under siege had more immediacy than a book about the entire world ending.<br /><br />For the majority of the book there are two major story arcs that the narrative hops back and forth between along with a few minor ones. In order to properly summarize the pros and cons of this book I will need to paraphrase the two major arcs without spoiling anything. Keep in mind, this isn't covering the two minor story arcs involving Marsh and his psychological battle against Ruin and Tensoon's conviction for breaking the kandra pact.<br /><br />The first story arc involves Elend and Vin attempting to conquer Fadrex City, which is kept under the sovereign rule of the obligator King Yomen. This story arc had both its ups and downs but ultimately was disappointing. What it does right is finally place Elend and Vin on the offensive. In The Final Empire and especially The Well of Ascension, the heroes had always had their backs to the wall from a vastly superior force. Placing them in a position of power raises some very interesting moral questions for the characters. They now have the initiative, but will they use it dishonorably and become the new Lord Ruler? This story arc also perfectly highlights Elend's character development that occurred between books. Through the lessons he learned from The Well of Ascension, Elend has become the Machiavellian ruler that his empire requires him to be. Honest intentions and fair legislation aren't enough to rule a monarchy, a king must be forceful with an iron resolve, even if this means doing some truly unpleasant things for the purpose of maintaining proper leadership. Unfortunately, this arc is painfully slow and the eventual outcome is rather disappointing given its pacing.<br /><br />The second story arc is vastly superior and is easily the highlight of the book. It involves Spook, Breeze, Allrianne, and Sazed trying to undermine the oppressive dictatorship of the city Urteau. Its regime is led by Quellion, a man who has perverted the actions of Kelsier and used it to create his own personal holocaust targeting anyone possessing a noble heritage. What made this story arc interesting was its focus on the dark side of revolutions, how a single individual can twist the charismatic words of another into creating atrocities. The cycle repeats itself and now the oppressed are now the oppressors. Spook was the star of this story arcand was easily the most interesting character in this book. He's a startlingly relatable character, the ordeals and the personal questions he faced made for a very compelling narrative; one that was only brought to grinding halt by the other story arcs. The biggest flaw of Hero of Ages is that it tries to be so much more than it should be. Instead of shifting to several story arcs that range from good to lackluster, Sanderson should have stuck to his established formula which had a very strong single narrative that involved every character. Splitting the narrative in this manner resulted in less interesting character interactions and a much less compelling plot.<br /><br />I also must comment on Ruin himself, he's a decent villain but he's not as compelling as the previous ones. He lacks the build-up and mystery of the Lord Ruler and the menace of Thrask and Zane Venture. He's not terrible per say, but like Hero of Ages itself Ruin simply pales in comparison to his predecessors, making his shortcomings all the more noticeable. Yet perhaps my biggest disappointment is the lack of action. Sanderson has established himself in my eyes as the best writer of action scenes in the fantasy genre. With Allomancy, characters would zoom across buildings at incredible speeds, use unorthodox methods and objects, and overall create fight scenes that even Hollywood would have trouble replicating. With the exception of the book's opening, there are very few fight scenes, and what's there didn't captivate me the way the previous ones had. Due to the book's length and slow pace, I merely slogged through the finale.<br /><br />Let's make this very clear, Hero of Ages is not a bad book. However, I felt that it was quite a large step down from the previous two books in the series and thus I don't feel comfortable giving it a higher score. It did accomplish what it set out to do in that it answered every question that fans were clamoring to uncover. But it didn't have the same sense of awe that pulled me into the other two novels. It simply tried to do to much and strayed away from the winning framework that made the others so incredible. In this case, less is more.
B00729GQ0A|2.0|I was very eager to read this book given the huge number of five star ratings, and the plot seemed intriguing and the protagonist was not a teenager, but 22.  I will say that the beginning moved really swiftly and was interesting; however, once Halloween came for me the story then dragged (about a third of the way through).  Not only did it drag, Sophia started to grate on my nerves, and the situations she found herself in and how she acted made me wonder if she was really a teenager not 22.  By this I mean the tone of the writing, teenagers think and explain these differently, Sophia was meant to be a graduate from College with a teacher's degree, but she spoke more like a teenager and actions also reflect this.  A couple of examples follow.  There is an ongoing storyline regarding Mrs Franklin, why not press charges? Why sell the land so cheaply? And why move in with Lauren when a couple of days later she was going to move in with Charles anyway, but then wait three months, without saying why?  These actions baffled me.<br /><br />In addition to the above mentioned plot parts, another major plot part that was not explained nicely.  Why did Sophia and Charles have the `should we or should we not' relationship?  Why was holding Charles back? And then when they did have one, it was not explained why there was the change, it was like bang we are now a couple. When a book places a relationship as a central plot point I need to care about whether the characters get together or not and I need to sympathise with the struggle of them deciding.  Neither of these things happened for me.  In addition to this, the `should we or should we not' carried on with the `should we or should we not sleep together', with no clear reason given for why they were holding back even after they had committed to each other. It never contained any true conflict for me and having or not having a relationship was meant to be about a conflict of some kind.<br /><br />Also secondary characters justseemed to come and go without care, her mother was a big part, but then disappeared for most of the story, her dad is always mentioned but never actually a part of the story, and Lauren is there, but doing what?<br /><br />I forced myself to finish this book so I could write a review (I don't review books that I don't read or finish), the speed did pick up at the end again, but by then I just did not care.  Obviously my opinion is very different from others whom have read this book, and I have asked myself what would have I liked to have known before reading this book, and what I really did not like about it.  I can sum it up simply:<br />1. The story moved too slow<br />2. Sophia reads like a teenager when she is not<br />3. Sophia and Charles are no star crossed lovers<br />4. The secondary characters are disjointed and come and go to easily<br /><br />Will I read it again? NO!<br />Would I recommend it? No, but others love this book and I disliked alot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm so stingy when it comes to praise that I've never bothered to review any of my Kindle purchases. But in this case, I really want more people to buy it so Hugh Howey will make enough money to keep writing. He is the best new author I've stumbled upon in a long time. I read the first Wool book for $0.99 and thought \\"Wow! I want more!\\", so I bought the Omnibus edition and it did not disappoint. The first book quickly sucks you in, and 2-5 lead you up to a really satisfying conclusion (though it's definitely not the end of the Wool story, which is a good thing). I would say more about it, but I don't want to spoil it.

0393088774|5.0|End this Depression Now contains Paul Krugman's analysis and prescriptions for the crisis that has gripped America and the world since 2008. The book is very readable and accessible; Krugman is skilled at using descriptive narrative and analogies while avoiding technical jargon.<br /><br />The most important aspect of the book is its focus on the on-going jobs crisis. Krugman clearly understands that, as far as most average people are concerned, access to a good job and decent wages are the most important gauge of prosperity. The book does a great job of highlighting the devastating human costs of the current unemployment crisis, especially for younger people who are just entering the job market and are unfortunately likely to feel the impact not just in the short term, but throughout their entire careers.<br /><br />Krugman shows how a lack of demand for products and services is keeping us in the current depression and may ultimately cost us at least $5 Trillion (and perhaps much more) in lost productive output and earnings. He also explains the \\"saltwater v. freshwater\\" rivalry in economics and suggests that conservative economists who argue against action to revive the economy are ignoring reality and relying on a \\"quasi-religious\\" faith in markets. Next he looks at how soaring income inequality resulted in policies such as excessive deregulation of the financial industry that directly led to the crisis. There's also a section on the problems in Europe and the role a common currency has played.<br /><br />Krugman argues effectively that the stimulus was insufficient and that we need more spending on infrastructure as well as more action by the Fed and revised rules to make it easier for homeowners to take advantage of low mortgage rates. As he points out, getting the economy growing and improving the job market should be our TOP PRIORITY. The best way to avoid a long term debt crisis is through economic growth. Austerity is going to make things worse, not better.(Evidence of this is already obvious in the UK economy after stringent austerity measures).<br /><br />The one thing that I dislike about the book is Krugman's willingness to sweep aside any discussion of structural, technological issues in the job market. There is no doubt that today's technology is having an impact, and not just for low skilled workers. That impact will only become more important in the future.<br /><br />Liberals are often very quick to dismiss any talk of structural employment issues because they believe (probably with justification) that conservatives will grasp onto that issue and use it as an excuse to do nothing. However, that does not have to be the case; it should be possible to have an active policy response and still incorporate an awareness of the changes occurring because of rapidly advancing technology.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the cyclical issues that Krugman talks about are certainly the most important immediate term consideration, and everyone would do well to read and understand this book. This crisis does not have to continue ruining lives and destroying the prospects for our young people. We can do something about it if we have the political will.

1401233791|5.0|When I was 7 years old, Knightfall hit the comic world like a ton of bricks.  Being 7 made it where I didn't understand comics all that well, but I was enthralled with the designs of Azrael as Batman and the monstrosity that is Bane.  It was enough where my father would allow me to pick up the Knightfall issues every 2 weeks.  I didn't pick up the entire Knightfall saga because of the hefty amounts of issues involved, but I have scattered issues to this day on the event.  And if you're like me, you definitely have been looking around to one day getting the entire event for yourself in some shape or form, either it be single issues or trade paperback. Thankfully, DC has given fans the opportunity in the past 15 years or so in trade forms.  But the thing is: it's never been complete.<br /><br />Batman Knightfall is the first ever Batman event made and DC wanted to make one hell of an impact on that notion.  Coming in the middle at the time of the famous Death of Superman story (specifically World Without Superman arc), Knightfall was unleashed to the masses that almost lasted 2 years worth.  The event is made up of 3 made sections of the event, with sub-sections.  Batman Knightfall the 1st main section, with sub-sections \\"Broken Bat\\" and \\"Who Rules the Night\\".  Batman Knightquest is the 2nd main section, with sub-sections \\"The Crusade\\" and \\"The Search\\".  And finally the last section Knightsend, with the sub-sections \\"Knightsend Aftermath\\", \\"Prodigal\\", and \\"Troika\\".  In all 15 years or so, DC has had various reprints of Knightfall and Knightsend, with numerous issues being exempted in-between all the reprints.  One of which being the \\"Prodigal\\" son trade (which is a small fortune), the \\"troika\\" arc, and most famous arc missing every issue: Knightquest.  That's about to change.<br /><br />With the up coming The Dark Knight Rises this year, DC is re-releasing material based off of the villain Bane (and to a certain extent, Ra's Al Ghul) for the films marketing.  This includes [[ASIN:1401233813 Batman: Birth of the Demon]], [[ASIN:1401233775 Batman Versus Bane]], and the preempt story [[ASIN:140123383X Batman: Venom]] as buildup to the grand story of Knightfall event re-print.  BUT...DC looks to have finally gotten the hint from the fans concerning the lack of incomplete issues and demand regarding them over the years.  It looks like DC is actually going to release the entire Knightfall event in proper older and affordability.  And from what it looks like, DC means business.<br /><br />BATMAN: KNIGHTFALL VOL.1 NEW EDITION collects the entire sections of \\"Broken Bat\\" and \\"Who Rules the Night\\" arcs:<br /><br />BATMAN: VENGEANCE OF BANE SPECIAL #1<br />BATMAN #491-500<br />DETECTIVE COMICS #659-666<br />SHOWCASE '93 #7 and 8<br />BATMAN: SHADOW OF THE BAT #16-18<br /><br />[Aside from Vengeance of Bane #1, all of the other material comes from [[ASIN:1563891425 Batman: Knightfall, Part One: Broken Bat]] and [[ASIN:B001TMZ1Q6 Knightfall: Part Two - Who Rules the Night [BATMAN KNIGHTFALL]]].  Please click on the links for far better and detailed reviews of the content. I will not go as in-depth as the other reviews since they do explain it much more.]<br /><br />Batman Vengeance of Bane #1 shows an entire origin story of the Bane, including growing up at birth in a prison, his ideology, and training Bane endured his whole life to lead him to the beginning of Knightfall.  For the longest time, this was a rare and expensive story to get a hold of, but is now included to help setup Bane.  This is a phenomenal introduction of Bane and you really believe in his whole being to possibly being Batman's equal.<br /><br />Batman Knightfall deals primarily with the introduction of Bane, a powerful and well-educated man from prison out to take the Batman and take over Gotham.  Bane breaks out all of the Arkham inmates, causing chaos among Gotham.  Batman gets put to the test of his very being fighting and re-capturing all the inmates, while slowly being worn out for the big fight with Bane.  Bane does his famous \\"back-breaker\\" and decommissions Bruce Wayne as Batman.  This leaves Gotham at the mercy of Bane, in which the possible Bat-replacement Jean-Paul Valley takes over the reigns as the new Batman.  He goes on a savage take-back of Gotham his own way, which finally makes it way to the battle of Jean-Paul and Bane.<br /><br />Batman Knightfall is big mainstay in the Batman mythos.  We get the obvious introduction of Bane, the first real time Batman physically and mentally gets pushed and broken to the limit, the perils of working alone, and the theme of a Batman that embraces brutality and even possibly murder.  And yes, all of this is here in this book (which tells you a lot, considering we still have Vol.2 and Vol.3 coming down the pipeline.)  If you're a new reader that's reading Snyder's current run on [[ASIN:1401235417 Batman Vol. 1: The Court of Owls (The New 52)]], then you have to see the first time Batman really fall hard and have epic scope at the same time.  There isn't anymore I could say the other reviews can explain better, so look that up.<br /><br />On the flipside of this book, the book does suffer from typical problems most comic events have: some filler material, possibly being too long, consistent change in writing and drawing, and various information leading up to the event that's not explained well for readers not caught up in the story.  Most the problems listed are minor in my opinion and don't really affect the overall saga, but could disrupt some readers.  The only thing readers could look into is the Knightfall prelude information.  Characters like Jean-Paul having no introduction (checkout [[ASIN:156389100X Batman: Sword of Azrael (Prelude to Knightfall)]] for that), Riddler being high on Venom, Black Mask attack to Batman, Bane attacking Jean-Paul, Bane attacking Killer Croc, and Batman being mysteriously exhausted all the time (presumably after the death of Jason Todd with [[ASIN:1401232744 Batman: A Death in the Family]]) are all information that's not explained at all in this book.  It's all information that is explained before Knightfall, and hopefully if the entire 3 volumes of the Knightfall saga sell well and the fans like it...maybe we can ask DC to make a Knightfall Prelude trade collection that includes this information in the future.<br /><br />Art is another big deal that has to be mentioned.  If you're not accustomed to the older drawings of 1993, most of the art might seem archaic by today's standards.  People who grew up and are more accustomed to this level of art will see no problem in the process, but again...new readers might really be turned off by 19 old art.  I still think the art is fabulous for it's time and age, but again, it won't be for everyone.<br /><br />Okay let's talk about this new 2012 edition.  The book has colored paper, but the paper is more akin to the older trade paperbacks paper (but I feel the color stands out a bit more),  has complete original covers before each issue, and has the original trade paperback covers and fold-out cover of issue #500.  That's about it for extras, but it's insignificant to the rest of the trade.  What I also have to mention and this applies for the upcoming Vol.2 and 3 editions, is the solicitation regarding the books.  All editions have information of what DC has listed for the contents, and the all 3 don't have wrong information...but incomplete information.  DC's solicitation of Knightfall has everything listed EXCEPT Detective Comics issues #661-666 and Shadow of the Bat #16 for example.  It's collected here, but those that want the complete Knightfall Saga really need to know exactly what each book has and we all want the complete saga.  So for Vol.2 and 3, you might want to wait until you get complete confirmation (Youtube, a friend, or go to your comic shop and look at the books description personally)about what each book has before buying.  Just to make sure.<br /><br />BATMAN KNIGHTFALL VOL.1 NEW EDITION is great start to what might be the true and complete collection of this sought after saga fans have wanted done right for years.  At 600+ pages for the pricing that you can't beat, and combined with all the Batman mythos so strongly here...I gave this a 5 score, which I think outweigh the faults.  The thing is most of this collection has been available for some time now in other trades...and the real test of the Knightfall saga will come with [[ASIN:1401235360 Knightquest (Batman: Knightfall, Vol. 2)]] which will be available for the first time ever in trade form and [[ASIN:1401237215 KnightsEnd (Batman: Knightfall, Vol. 3)]] which includes the \\"Prodigal\\" storyline at an affordable price.

0345803485|5.0|This book is not cut and dry.  It's not all about sex. It's not about a weak woman who wants to be controlled by a man. It's about a relationship between a damaged young man who I believe truly wants to be loved and an innocent young woman who is discovering the power of love. Fifty is not for every reader. Just like the horror of Silence of the Lambs or the sanitized writing of Mary Higgins Clark is not for every reader.  To each his or her own way.<br /><br />Young handsome rich Christian Grey admits he is \\"fifty shades of f***ed up\\".  He is drawn to quick witted and beautiful Anastasia Steele. He warns her he doesn't do the girlfriend thing. He doesn't do romance, no hearts and no flowers. He doesn't make love. His lifestyle of dominance is all he knows. Ana is drawn to him for some reason she can't understand despite the fact he doesn't like to be touched and he wants a relationship only on his terms<br /><br />Ana is shocked and thrilled by Grey's erotic desires and then thrilled and shocked by her own.  She discovers that Grey is hiding a past that has damaged him emotionally and forces him into a need for control.  He doesn't want to put fear in her, so he wants her to sign a contract as to the limits in which they will go in his \\"red room of pain\\". She puts off signing the contract by negotiating the terms with him. This gives her time to examine her feelings and try to understand why he is the way he is.<br /><br />Ana states: \\"I am terrified of the depth of feeling I have for you and the dark path you are leading me on... I'm curious but I'm also scared you'll hurt me physically and emotionally\\" She then questions isn't that a risk in any relationship?<br /><br />Ana is not a stupid woman. She recognizes his \\"punishment\\" as demeaning and abusive (it's consensual) & she is shocked by the way she feels after the first time.  She feels guilty & confused, but she doesn't give up on trying to understand Christian.  She wants more from Christian. She gets to know him more than any person ever has in his life, mainly because she doesn't give in to his contract.  She is smart and independent yet still very innocent and Christian is drawn to that and he experiences many \\"firsts\\" with Ana he didn't know he was capable of.<br /><br />Fifty Shades is mesmerizing, humorous, disturbing, emotional, frightening and sad.  I might have turned fifty shades of red reading it, but I was fascinated with the first story of Christian and Ana.w him more than any person ever has in his life, mainly because she doesn't give in to his contract.

B00723NWJE|5.0|Some of the songs on \\"Little Broken Hearts\\"  are dark.  I like the fact that Norah is expressing darker themes in her music.  My favorite track is \\"Miriam\\". This song is about addressing a cheating husband's lover.  It is also about the dark violent thoughts expressed  by a wife when she learns of the infidelity.  The title song \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is a song with an excellent beat.  This is a song about taking revenge after being wronged.  \\"Say Goodbye\\" has a cheeky sensual tone to it.  This is a break up song without the the usual tone of regret.  \\"Happy Pills\\" is a similar song in theme to \\"Say Goodbye\\".  This song is about feeling liberated after a break up.  \\"After The Fall\\" is an opposite song in tone to the \\"Happy Pills\\"  This song is about the feelings that a person carries after a relationship ends.  \\"Out On The Road\\" is a song about the freedom of the open road.  \\"4 Broken Hearts\\" is a song about how difficult it is to remain faithful in a romantic relationship.  I love the slow tempo of this song.  \\"Take It Back\\" is a song that I did not analyze too much. This song simply has a soothing quality that I enjoy very much.  The deep sound of the cello makes this song special. \\"She's 22\\" is a song about relinquishing feelings about someone in a relationship in a younger woman.  \\"All A Dream\\" is a song that would make a good poem.  This song conjures up poetic images of trees and the moon.  \\"Good Morning\\" is a beautiful song about a failed relationship.  This song sounds very relaxing.  The new music on \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is superb.  I like this album very much.

Number one Mr. Manson (Brian Warner) had to have someone help him write this piece of trash.<br /><br />If you want a book that is full of sex, drugs, degrading and depraved this is the book for you.<br /><br />Artist, right...........his music sucks, his art sucks and now this book sucks.<br /><br />This book was a true waste of my time.<br /><br />He comes off as a decaying, immature soul that never progressed beyond junior high, never got beyond his being bullied and came off as brutish, mean, cruel and a narcissist psychopath that never grew up to manhood.<br /><br />If I had three people I would not want to have lunch with, he would be one of them, even if someone offered me 1 million dollars.<br /><br />Just would not want to even be in the same room with this slime ball and people actually pay to see this garbage?<br /><br />Rent this book from your library first or borrow a copy.  It's not worth even .1 + 3.99 S&H.<br /><br />Like the title of this review, I would give this book minus five.<br /><br />If there are that many mindless morons that think his stuff is music, then our planet is indeed in trouble.<br /><br />This by the way, is the only book I've ever rated a negative five and the only book that was so repulsive I could not finish it and I've been a avid reader for 53 years.<br /><br />Read L. A. Marzulli instead and you will figure out that there are such people as the walking dead.<br /><br />In order to find out how this piece of trash could get so many stars, this depraved entity become so famous - read, Russ Dizdar's \\"The Black Awakening\\".................this one book will explain where Marilyn Manson and those that follow him are on the cosmic chess board.<br /><br />And yes we are at war.<br /><br />May Yeshua be praised and satan go to hell with your little horde of \\"monsters\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|I expected the middle book of the trilogy to be more fluff and slow going due to past experience, but this book kept me reading from beginning to end!<br />I love this series!
B007Q476KU|1.0|The movie started off well, but quickly descended into the abyss of improbability.  It was so far fetched so as to be beyond the realm of possibility.  Too many wild coincidences.  Also, there was too much gratuitous sorrow and carnage that seemed to serve no purpose but to make the story seem... well, just plain dumb.<br /><br />It wasn't worth the rental fee and I'm sorry I wasted time watching it.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I'm a self admitted book worm, I love reading whenever I can so after reading the rave reviews about this book I downloaded the book for my Kindle.<br />I just cannot get into this book. My mind keeps wandering and I've lost my place numerous times. Some seem to love these books but I just cannot enjoy them. I doubt I'll be keeping this in my library.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Brilliant portrayal of Margret Thatcher.  However, too much of the movie was spent depicting her later years as she suffers from mental decline and not enough telling us the story of her as Prime Minister.  What's the point of dwelling on her as an elderly senile shell of her former self?  Too bad, it could of been a wonderful movie, and about half of it is.  The other half is simply pathetic.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars for the remarkable acting performance.
067144901X|5.0|Sing the words to the tune of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, \\"Moo ba la la la that barnyard fun dance\\".  I promise it will be your favorite books, forget the kids.  It is just a fun read.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Amazing story!  One of the ultimate feel good true stories.  A tale of inspiration about overcoming the odds and succeeding in life.  Everyone should watch this film!!
0345505387|2.0|I really love graphic novels. Mostly stories that are adapted or created entirely for one book, not manga or 'series', or comic books. I love when a writer and artist combine to make a picture story.<br /><br />I've never read any of the Outlander books, and the story is not my beef with The Exile. It's not the words, it's the illustrations... they're horribly lifeless. Detailed, but lifeless. When a character speaks, their faces are frozen expressions, lips are always sealed, even with word bubbles popping out of them. A smile, a laugh, a look of fear, yes. But they do not translate from one image to the next. The illustrator makes 'reading' this graphic novel a complete headache. The paintings are chopped up. In one block Jamie and Friends will be riding horses, or walking somewhere, in the next, they will be laying on the ground, or in a totally new backdrop which doesn't show itself again.<br /><br />From the opening pages to the end, I couldn't figure out where the characters were, or what they were doing. You're thrown from scene to scene! Even when there are only two characters and an empty field, the artist finds some way of making you feel like 20 minutes pass in between each still frame and there are chunks of story missing.<br /><br />The illustrations do not weave together to make a story, they're very 'flat' and individual. I have a feeling this artist is talented and able, but does not know how to properly illustrate a graphic novel. Flow is essential and this book has none! You can see for yourself, Amazon.com has a few series of photos from the novel.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very pleased with picture quality and easy access to them. Highly recommend Game of Thrones Season 1 to everyone. I can not wait to get season 2.
B001NLKT60|5.0|OMG!!! Again Lisbeth ROCKS!!! Stieg Larsson is/was a brilliant man! This book got my heart rate racing so many times!! I thought that I might need to check into the ER... just in case... while I finished it!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy listening to the bible while working.  But whoever is reading the ASV, OMG they read entirely too fast.  Other than that, I enjoy using this app.
B0015DROBO|5.0|LOVE this book!!! Lisbeth is my FAVORITE!! She is very mysterious, brilliant, calculating... and hard as bleepin nails!!! The first few chapers of the book are very confusing (SOOO many names of characters and Swedish townships... hard to keep track) and a bit slow. Hang in there... you won't be sorry!!
B006QKJRGG|3.0|I didn't understand the hate. This kept me watching, and any movie that does that is worth my money. Some people are just snotty about everything they watch. Seriously.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|,.....awesome awesome. awesome. cool great. play this game then come rate Lol. this game is fun though I like playing the scratch game too haha.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Sinead O'Connor - How About I Be Me (And You Be You?) (2012)<br /><br />Every song is simply wonderful. The lyrics are so naked and honest, peppered with both Christian devotion and lots of cussing. Her occasional whispers cause me to wonder if her voice isn't quite what it once was, but this could just be the way she chose to sing. Regardless, her voice remains a powerful force like none other. The music is fundamentally rock n' roll - guitar, bass and drums, exceptionally produced with various additional instruments and orchestration. It all serves to compliment Sinead's unique voice which always takes center stage with remarkably exquisite vocal melodies. Not since I DO NOT WANT WHAT I HAVEN'T GOT in 1990 has she put out an album this good, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game! I play it on my new kindle fire and I absolutely LOVE it!!!:D &lt;3 Its very fun and easy too! I definetly recommend it for all ages!:)
B007VGXS8M|5.0|This is a great app for the Waldo fans. I had hours of fun playing. YES one of the books in old Japan is very hard to find but its there.
145162445X|5.0|Doctor Krauss writes in an immensely readable style and explains his subject with a clarity that is strikingly different from that employed by his detractors.  Religious apologists use logical fallacies and wordplay to misdirect their readers instead supplying empirical evidence.  Doctor Krauss' rapier wit makes his book both very informative and highly entertaining.  I recommend this book without reservation.
0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this series, even though I felt that Collins was dumbing it down for a YA audience and was \\"telling\\" too much rather than \\"showing.\\" But this book leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />She tried desperately to create a love triangle that never really was. You could clearly see the relationship between Peeta and Katniss taking on a whole new meaning in Catching Fire - and then you felt her desperation in the beginning of Mockingjay while he was the prisoner of the Capital. Then he's returned to her and.... nothing. There's nothing. He's returned to her as a rage-filled shell of his former self and she scorns and ridicules him. He's trying to figure out what memories are real and what ones were \\"induced\\" and she offers no help or comfort. She watches him struggle to find reality and rather than sit down and have a conversation with him, she belittles him and reacts with stoicism. I get that Collins keeps trying to pass Katniss off as stoic and cold, but her internal monologue suggests otherwise, so it's completely contradictory. She did not feel like the Katniss that left the arena in Catching Fire clutching Peeta's pearl and calling his name. In Mockingjay, she would rather shoot him in the head to put him out of his misery than offer the slightest bit of comfort. And this is after she was going insane thinking that Snow was torturing him... But because he was returned to her in less than perfect condition after said torture, they should just kill him rather than spend any time trying to help him.<br /><br />The whole \\"thing\\" with Gale was completely contrived (almost like an after-thought). Never once did I believe that Katniss had any romantic feelings for him. And never once did I believe that Gale really had any for her. Every so often after a couple of chapters he would come back with a, \\"Oh, BTW, I still like you. We should kiss.\\" And that was it. There was no real emotion.<br /><br />What little action andbattle that there was in the book was confusing and boring. Collins has no talent for writing extended battle scenes. It was a whole lot of build up to a short summary of the action that was hard to follow. Then, when all else failed, she made Katniss pass out to wake up later and get an update from the others that didn't fall to the ground shaking and vomiting. Where was the Katniss that was so quick thinking and resourceful from the other two books?<br /><br />Katniss spends the majority of her time complaining, hiding, complaining some more about the same things, running away anytime anyone says something that upsets her, wanting to kill herself, wanting to kill other people, and then passing out again.<br /><br />I was bored through most of this book and it was sorely disappointing. There was no character development or real character interaction at all, really. She should have done a better job with the characters that she created. They deserved to be the center of her story rather than focusing so much on Katniss' meltdowns and the throw away characters that she killed off right away.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie about Master Ip.<br /><br />Compared to a lot of Chinese martial arts movies, this one was more real world in regards to human physics.<br /><br />The acting by Donnie Yen was very well done indeed.<br /><br />Kudos.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Loving this series...like having the option of different games within a game! Fun &amp; challenging! Like the twist of having the bonus tiles!
B004X4RU9I|3.0|I really enjoyed the first movie about Master Ip.<br /><br />This second follow up is alright, but I still favor the first.<br /><br />Acting by Donnie Yen is also excellent in this second version, but the Martial Arts are not on par with the first.
B006RUJST6|5.0|When i first this book in items that were recommended for me to read, I skipped over it a couple of times. About a week later I finally purchased it and I am so glad that I did. This book was amazing from start to finish and kept me interested the entire time. A Lot of people have already given the summary of the book so I won't. While reading Slammed it brought out so many emotions i felt like I was going through everything right along with Lake. It was really easy to fall in love with all the characters they were so well thought out and portrayed. I would definetly recommend this book to family and friends. Can't wait for the second book!
B0068RQ85K|5.0|I started with the basic Coiling Gizmo (Econo Winder) and loved it, so I bought the Deluxe Coiling Gizmo to get cranking rods in more sizes. This is a great tool for making coils, and this version also includes an attached clamp, which appears to be screwed on, so I guess you could remove it if you need to. It appears very durable, and I love the length and sizes of coils I can make with the crank rods. The \\"working area\\" of the crank rods is just under 8 inches.<br /><br />I was frustrated that the product description did not give the diameters of the five crank rods, so I emailed Artistic Wire, who always respond promptly. Their response: \\"Unfortunately, we do not have exact sizes for the rods. As they can vary slightly. If you are looking at this tool to make jump rings for chain maille. It does not have the precise measurements needed for that function.\\"<br /><br />So, I measured them myself. My \\"Digital Thickness Gauge\\" seems inconsistent, so I used my SWG wire gauge (I don't have an AWG gauge). With it, they measured 18-gauge (1.22mm), 15-gauge (1.83mm), 10-gauge (3.25mm), 8-gauge (4.06mm) and 6-gauge (4.88mm). (For those of you who might have the Econo Winder, for comparison purposes, the crank rod sizes on mine are the same as the 1.2mm and 1.83mm rods on the Deluxe.) Of course, according to the Artistic Wire email, others might not have the same sizes.<br /><br />I bought it off eBay for $14.99, and sadly, I saw today that my local Michael's store has started carrying it just this week (they have improved their jewelry-making tools section) and their price is $10.99, which is the same price as on the Artistic Wire website. With no shipping cost and Michael's almost-continuous 40% off coupon, I could have gotten it there for $6.60. So, I might have to buy another for when I wear this one out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|never had a problem with this app and I got it back around Christmas time at fire release. no random ads. no crashes. ive played this game hundreds of times. ads will show when you start new games but not all the time... which is nice
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is one of the best adaptations of a book to screen that I have seen. The special effects are nothing short of awesome. While I do have access to this via On Demand nothing can beat being able to watch these on DVD, so glad I picked these up and I can't wait for season 2!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love my bible... It provides me with the word that I need when I need it how God intended it... Now, for the program... It works fine for me, and is easily navigatable, and the highlighting and bookmarking portions are on point for a free program... I've never had any issues with updates, or crashes on my Samsung Transform Ultra.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am so addicted to this trilogy. I literally got nothing complete, and being able to purchase the books on my kindle didn't help much. As soon as I finished the first I had to read the second.. and so on. Yes, sometimes these books are hard to read, the writing isn't always the best. I loved every part of this trilogy, I recommend it to pretty much everyone I meet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love that I can read the Bible anywhere using this app. I also like the various devotions.  It is nice to be able to switch versions to get a better understanding of what the Bible says.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was introduced to this series last week, I couldn't put the books down. I had this book read in under 24 hours. I suggest reading it when you have plenty of time,  you won't want to put it down.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|well done game, attractive graphics. Love to play it. Don't care for nagging. I played free version for several weeks then bought paid version for half price.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This whole series is amazing. I read all three books in a matter of days. I suggest reading these book when you have nothing to do, you won't want to set it down.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so much fun I love making all the food. it takes time but in the end its really fun and its free;)
B004I8WD6E|4.0|After trying several different covers, including the pricey ones, I really like this one the best. This one is the only one that I have found where the edges on the front completely cover the screen protector which keeps it in place. The feel is great, it isn't bulky either.  Just one thing I wish it had is raised covering over the volume keys and the power button. This would make it easier to operate the phone as well as keeping out dust. I hope they hear this and make those little changes.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It's a great story AND a remarkable discussion of the developing \\"barefoot\\"running movement!<br /><br />The author, a self-described galump, put on shoes and started running and in process comes to understand the joy of running!<br /><br />A great read and a huge motivater to get the shoes off and run in the grass!
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Must cop to playing it over and over and over. This is an incredible production - I don't believe there is a better one. And the Queen of the Night? She is the definitive QUEEN OF THE NIGHT. Outstanding. Outstanding. Outstanding. A joy to watch as well as to hear. I can't imagine anyone being anything other than spellbound. I find I can't just listen, but must stop to see. This Magic Flute is a must have.
B007HJ84WS|2.0|Just boring.  The only thing that kept me going was Cavill's abs.  The conversations were slow, and the relationships were just dull.
0307702103|1.0|This review is for the audiobook only.  I couldn't finish even the first CD, so have no idea about the quality of the writing.  Poor Grisham (and poor me) didn't have anyone strong enough to tell him he can't act.  He can't even READ his own work.  He repeatedly puts the second part of a sentence in the front of the next sentence.  His style is so wooden, it's jarring.  I so much wanted to enjoy this collection, but the truly awful presentation made it impossible.
B007JUWTI0|3.0|Sure, the fights would have been fantastic on the big screen, but thank God that I didn't spend that money on the lacking of plot.<br /><br />It was a pity.  Plus, I really hope they don't make the sequel.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I'm thrilled to raise my son in a world where he's got a top notch Hollywood film produced for every super hero character he's likely to enjoy. For Superman I'll show him the Reeves films as well as the Routh and Cavill interpretations. He'll have Batman with Michal Keaton, The Flash with John Wesley Shipp, X-Men lead by Patrick Stewart, Punisher best portrayed by Dolph Lundgren, Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman, Swamp Thing, The Fantastic Four, and the list goes on. Having Green Lantern to add to the mix is pure gravy. This movie nailed it. I know there's plenty of idiots who fail to see the genius of this film, and I'm thrilled not to be one of those fools. This movie executes the Green Lantern mythology like a boss, and leaves those uncomfortable with the notion of space cops in the dated dust they belong in. The movie is awesome. Don't let Nolan fanboys tell you otherwise. It's a true GL fanboy gift.

0399226907|5.0|My eleven week old loves this book.  It is a very cute story with lovely illustrations.  My son and I are huge Eric Carle fans.  I highly recommend this book for any child's library, it's so much fun!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book is truly meant only for those who have read the first part.<br />It is a graphic sexual erotic romance story but lacks vampires and the paranormal.<br />The first volume is Fifty shades of Gray. That is s must read. The third book will be out soon. I am waiting for that one.
B000AP04EW|4.0|any married couple watching this might closely relate to this action packed comedy... i.e. the super steamy start, the unfolding ennui, the forced emotion, constant lies, the hatred, the death wish, and the deux-ex machina, the therapist!!  loved this film... intrigue, suspense, humor, and a cathartic conclusion... thought the dept store shootout was overly protracted but the makeup scene was well worth the wait, this is one muy caliente (sp) team that sizzles in every scene and the crazy violence only enhances the instincts...Brad n Angie have a lovely tribute to their on screen nadir which will provide intense excitement for both sexes...thanks for this gift of entertainment! high recommend
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is great for kindle fire...only problem I have found: cannot visit friends would have 5 stars if they fix that
B0034G4P7G|1.0|the algorithm for face mash is completely erroneous due to the R(a) - R(b) like terms, there is NO rating, just pick one, left or right to pyrimid to top, and how could this on the window alert the Sys Admin to a potential crash.... as Mark smuggly responds to Admin Hearing for breach...4 hours would be a very long time in '03 to id in a secure small scale LAN...
B007R41E8O|4.0|I played this game on my kindle fire. Although it did download twice which took awhile (hence the 4 stars) other wise, amazing game I would compare it to my all time fave Cd Rom game Nancy Drew! In fact I have to play it again! I got off the island, but didn't solve the mystery! I want more like this!
B003B02OOG|5.0|As usual, another wonderful book by John Grisham.  Nice to have the short stories.  Still in the South and still lawyer related, but a nice change.
B007BRJYF2|4.0|I was extreamly pleased with everything this game had to offer. It was challenging, but not frustrating or impossible, graphics are wonderful, I love that it stays true to the story. I played kn a kindle fire. My only complaint I finished it so fast. well worth the money. Unlike so many others ive wasted money n time on. highly recommend!
B007549W62|4.0|The Divide is a brutal film that doesn't pull any punches as it comments on the breakdown of humanity during a time of crisis.  A nuclear bomb hits New York City and nine strangers find themselves trapped in a makeshift fallout shelter in the basement of an apartment complex.  As you may expect, emotions run high and bad things happen.  These types of movies usually split the crop of reviews among two sides.  Those who are absolutely disgusted by the movie based on what they see and those who appreciate the movie for what it is.  I'll stump for the movie because the cast turns in believable performances of difficult roles; in particular Michael Beihn who is extraordinary as a complex and nuanced antagonist.<br /><br />I've always found it interesting that horror movies with even higher levels of graphic gore and violence don't often get these kinds of responses.  Is \\"The Divide\\" difficult to watch at times?  Yes.  Could it happen?  Absolutely!  Anyone who believes otherwise should open a history book once in a while.
0143039881|4.0|I was in my senior year in high school when Eichmann was kidnapped from Argentina and taken to Israel to stand trial. I was in college when he was executed. It made quite an impression on me because that was my introduction to the Nazi death camps and the utter incomprehensibility of evil on the scale of nations. I read numerous books on the subjects of the death camps and the Third Reich at the time, so that Eichmann and the death camps have been part of my conscious awareness of the unspeakable brutality of man ever since. At the time I was exposed to the horrors of the slave labor and death camps, but I don't believe that I read Eichmann in Jerusalem nor am I sure when the famous phrase from the work \\"the banality of evil\\" entered into my conscious understanding that evil is banal and is rarely easily identifiable.  It is easy to say after the fact that this deed or this person was \\"evil,\\" but so often we lack the perspective needed to identify it when it is in front of us, especially when practiced on the scale available to the modern nation state.  Arendt in her Epilogue rightly points out that the existence of the nuclear bomb takes mass murder to a scale unprecedented in human history.<br /><br />Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem is a report on the trial, which she claims she summarized from the transcripts handed out each day to the reporters covering the trial.  Eichmann was the transportation manager who arranged the train schedules to carry Jews to the camps.  In its own way, the short book is a history of Eichmann's role in the institutionalized evil of mass murder of unthinkable scale which the Nazis invented and an insight into how they made it function.  Eichmann's trial followed the Nuremberg trials and made use of the precedents set by them, although there were significant precedents set by his trial also.  Perhaps the most important were the kidnapping of Eichmann from Argentina in violation of international law. Since Eichmann was not an Argentiniancitizen, the argument went, he was technically stateless and therefore normal extradition procedures did not apply. The painful irony is that the Nazi government in a concern for legality in state ordered murder had made the Jews stateless in order to kill them.  Of concern also was the precedent for trying Eichmann in a state which had not existed at the time he committed his crimes; counsel for the defense consequently argued that he should be sent to Germany for trial. Germany never asked for extradition, so the trial continued in Jerusalem. There was also discussion of an international tribunal to try him, but the make-up of such a court would have been problematic - what nations should serve? He was charged with \\"crimes against the Jewish people,\\" rather than with war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Arendt argues that he should have been charged with crimes against humanity.  Both are ambiguous legal statements which are probably still open to legal interpretation and philosophical debate.<br /><br />The overriding question in the 1960s was how does mankind reclaim its humanity in the face of such institutionalized evil?  I'm not sure that it is possible, and I'm not sure that Arendt satisfactorily answers that question; perhaps it cannot be answered because the enormity of the evil is utterly incomprehensible to civilized man. When such crime is committed in the name of civilization, how do we restore the balance, and what, then, are the acts of civilized man?<br /><br />Eichmann was found guilty, hanged, cremated, and the ashes scattered in the ocean outside Israel's territorial waters. Eichmann was an ordinary man of modest education. He was not a thinker or a reader, and, in accord with Nazi doctrine, not a religious man.  Defense counsel claimed that he was \\"a cog in the machine,\\" a defense used by several at Nuremberg, but a meaningless defense which only emphasizes the banality of evil and the degree to which murder had been institutionalizedin Nazi Germany.  Eichmann's trial emphasizes the point that evil is ordinary; good is the extraordinary quality and requires conscience, courage, effort, and sacrifice.  Eichmann was without conscience because the Nazi death machine was so departmentalized that conscience would have required unusual perspicacity and will.  If Eichmann knew what was happening, and it was proved that he did, yet lacked the will to resist, then, he, according to the court, is guilty of crimes against Jews and in Arendt's perspective crimes against humanity.  In a nation in which state sanctioned murder is possible and allowed to continue, especially in a state which considers itself moral, how does man find the conscience to resist in the name of civilization?  If the earth does not cry out for justice in such a situation, how can we satisfy ourselves that justice was done in Eichmann's trial or in the trials of any of the Nazis who were tried?  The banality of evil is open ended because evil can be so normal, so ordinary.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|Ask any biology major: you can't mix acids and bases. Ask any alchoholic: you can't mix Burbon and Scotch. And ask any serious rock fan: you CAN'T mix the Velvet Underground with Metallica! Any true rock historian should own \\"Velvet Underground & Nico\\", \\"White Light/White Heat\\", \\"Loaded\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and Master of Puppets\\". But if you play any of those first three albums back-to-back with either of the last two it just won't sound right. Too bad James Hetfield and Lou Reed didn't realise this in time.<br />\\"Lulu\\" will NOT destroy Lou Reed's lagacy- which already survived \\"Metal Machine Music\\" (1975). In fact, hardcore Reed fans will probably like \\"Lulu\\". But Metallica... after regaining ground lost from \\"Saint Anger\\" with \\"Death Magnetic\\" (which, as OK as it was, didn't hold-a-candle to their first three albums) managed to ram another nail in the coffin of their already fragil career. Their propossed next effort with Rick Rubin had better be nothing short of the-greatest-album-ever-recorded or that's it! For good this time...
