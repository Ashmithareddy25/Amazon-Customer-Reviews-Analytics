B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app but I wish it was easier to get diamonds it would also be really cool if I could breed my horse with other players or renamed it
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is the best season of the show, in my opinion. And it starts off with all of the characters introducing themselves to us. Great.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|One of the best opening scenes I've seen! Would've liked to see how 007 survived the shot and the fall, though!
B00005UKKF|5.0|The outfits, the performances and that body. Pop never looked so good. This is Britney at her prime, people. It's awesome.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Wish I had seen other reviews about problem getting a certain game piece under the side tab was going great till that point
B002MRRRAA|5.0|This DVD has it all: music and in your face rock and roll attitude as it was given to you 90s style. So perfect. Great gift for any Nirvana fan. My personal fav DVD.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF RECORDINGS AND VERY COMPLETE, HOWEVER THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION SEEM TO LEAD ONE TO THING THE RECORDINGS WERE ALL BY THE SAME ORCHESTRA --- THE PRICE IS VERY  GOOD.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate, dependable, and easy to use. This app is the best Ive used for predicting weather. I use it for travel also.  And it's free!!!!!
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie is one of those that you cannot figure out the end result as usual. It's worth your time. Get a bowl of popcorn and cuddle up. It will scramble your brain. NICE!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Slow start.  But you still root for Kay and Benton, Lucy and Marino. End was a little quick but I was glad to see Janet back again. Can't wait for the next book.
1423136802|5.0|A very good book easy to read and fallow with likeable personalities and a unique way of looking at the world
B0013TTLDE|1.0|I read this for our book club.  It was really good.  It was, what I would<br />call a 'page turner.'  The ending doesn't disappoint.  My only criticism is<br />the numerous 'foreshadows' of the 'big event.'
1574214276|5.0|I like the description of zentangles, how it works in your life.  I like the many samples, the tangles that are shown.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Robin Trower's latest album \\"Roots and Branches\\" is an excellent step forward for the artist. The sound is uncluttered and the sonic imaging is quite deep...the arrangements are stripped down and recorded with a glowing analog-sounding warmth. This is a quite earthy record indeed and one that reminds me a bit more of 2005's \\"Another Days Blues\\" than of Trower's more recent albums.<br /><br />Trower's tone and phrasing, which has mellowed sweetly over his prolific career, is as fine as it has ever been. His shimmery guitar lines are the most vocal they have ever been. Trower's sound is unmistakable- there are very few guitarists who have such richness of tone.<br /><br />The record is a mix of freshly arranged classic R&B tunes and a few fine new Trower originals; the record's pace and atmosphere are steady, assured and quite inviting. The lead vocals are split between Trower and bassist Richard Watts. While Watts is the stronger singer of the two, Trower's vocals are confident and enjoyable throughout. This is a grown up R&B album, not a rock album, and it is an exceptionally fine one from a truly seminal artist. Trower Power is alive and well!
B0015AARJI|4.0|This is the controller we always get and it seems to work good.  I don't know if sony has anything better or not, but if you can find the sony for a good price its usually a good controller.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game but it isn't coming in.is anyone else having trouble with it? I'd feel better if someone was.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hours of fun. Great for problem solving and improving Brain functionality. Flow offers multi-levels of game play. I would highly recommend this game to all ages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very fun. And it is addictive and so much more fun and 3D. I would recommend this game to anyone ! Get the game!
B0091REZMW|5.0|love the game.. super addictive .... cant stop playing just wish there was easier way for getting diamonds other then that love it
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Loved every second.  Not usually a Bill Murray fan but his cameo is funny.  Laughs abound.  Probably going to purchase dvd.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really enjoy this game and I can play it with my daughter, I would recommend this game for kids and adults too
B0000029LG|5.0|History is my favourite album by Michael Jackson, because of the new songs on Disk 2. These songs make History the most autobiographical of Michael's albums. Music critics say that \\"off the wall\\" was Michael's first \\"adult\\" album, but I think that it is in History disk two that we really see Michael in all the fullness of his mature, adult self. By saying this, I do NOT mean that Michael was not mature or adult before. In fact, he was shockingly mature even as a little boy. But before History, Michael's music came out of the rich imaginative world of his creative heart and mind which was dominated by magic and joy. Oh make no mistake, the darkness was always there - the Billie Jeans and the dirty Dianas and the tabloid press that would not leave him alone - but his response to them was one of compassion and even fun. If the world he constructed through his earlier albums was one of \\"magic realism\\", the one he presented in History disk two is one where stark realism for the first time dominates over magic realism. For 1993 was different. For the first time the darkness really got to him and affected him on the most fundamental level. The songs on disk two are his direct responses to these experiences. They are cries of pain and screams of frustration and snarls of disgust and anger from a soul convulsing under an ordeal that pushes him to the limits of endurance. What is amazing to me is that these cries and screams and snarls are so doggone BEAUTIFUL - quite simply, Michael made beautiful, impassioned music out of his pain and grief and anger and disgust. He not only turned suffering into art, he turned the personal experience of injustice into a transcendent statement. Through his own suffering he spoke for the suffering of all who are mistreated. Even the terrible ordeal of unjust and cruel persecution could not dampen his ideals which were always about love and a united and caring world. In History, we find the magnificent anthem Earth Song, which is not only a mind-boggling epic of a song, it is quite simply the most stunningly beautiful and impassioned plea for the planet that I have ever heard. This album is just incredible both as a musical achievement and as an artistic response to social and planetary injustice; beautiful and raw in its emotional honesty, yet pointing, despite all the emotional turmoil, at the highest humanistic ideals. There is nothing like it in the history of music.ind-boggling epic of a song, it is quite simply the most stunningly beautiful and impassioned plea for the planet that I have ever heard.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was superbly written and thought out, but heart wrenching as you read through and Lena and Ethan weren't together and happy. So I loved this book, but it was kind of like the second book of the twilight series, you knew it was wrong and what needed to happen, and you couldn't wait to get back to having them happy again.
0273710516|2.0|I'm a pretty avid reader of business books but I haven't made it through the first chapter of this one.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Entertaining, well written if a bit simple.  Fine vacation book.  Fictional tale of a dark point of early American history.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I must admit I was very surprised when I came to the end of the book, not what I expected, but in reflection understandable.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I love Ellen's show. But this book was just silly. I laughed out loud a few times but other than that it was just nonsense.

B006N0YWGY|4.0|What I like about this game is that it's not just a racing game, it's also a trading game.  The same developer has a Beach Buggy game which is very good, also, but it's just racing.<br /><br />So, you have 10 days - or runs, basically - to buy and sell stuff from the various locations on the map.  After purchasing you &#34;race&#34; to the next location, which generally takes less than a minute.  You can pick up extra cash along the way and you can also earn time bonuses.  Otherwise the driving is almost superfluous, but pretty fun (I use the tilt controls and they're great on my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0).  Graphics are good and the quality can be adjusted to improve performance, if needed, though I'm able to keep it pretty high without issue.<br /><br />Every store has the same 8-10 items and they tell you if the price is roughly average, low or high.  Buy what you want, race to the next location, hopefully make a profit.  After 10 rounds you cash out and your total score is how much money you earned.  A full game takes less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />It's a good diversion and there's some suspense and drama about what the prices will be at the next stop.  Also there are sometimes &#34;events&#34; which will dramatically raise or lower the price of an item.  If you can take full advantage of one of those then you can cash in big.  But those events are random and sometimes the timing is all wrong and you lose out.<br /><br />Good game!  I'd like them to make a sequel and add just a bit more depth somehow.  Very worthwhile, though!
B00004YA66|5.0|I received the product even faster than expected, the price was excellent and the product is just as described, great!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I d/l'd this for my 6 year old daughter.  She has an android tablet with games which she is only allowed to play through the Kid's Place app - primarily to avoid in-app purchases, but also I don't feel that little kids need to be online to play games.<br /><br />Well, unfortunatley this app won't work without an active wifi connection, so that's a deal breaker.  This is a game for kids, so why is an internet connection required?<br /><br />Fortunately there are plenty of apps out there that DON'T require a connection, so we'll be sticking to those.

B009K0P10K|5.0|Great plot twists, was glad there was a season 2, because the end of season 1 was a cliff hanger.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|By the third book even though the storyline kept me reading I  found myself skipping  thru the sex scenes. Overload!

B0039ZF8D2|4.0|This collaboration was not accepted to well when this awaited CD dropped. It is a slight disappointment, but its high movements are very high and numerous. It takes a while to enjoy, to much better material was left off because they decided to squeeze 2 CD's out of the collaboration. The choices they left off, I heard on a Damian CD and a Nas CD. Big mistake. I think they overrated their material. Their is a great future for this collaboration. Like I said, the high moments are very high. I like it very much, but are reticent to recommend it. Give some cuts a listen, you will either like it a lot, like myself, or it may have to take the chance.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|love the game but I have been trying 2 pull it up on my kindle but it just instantly shuts down what do I do
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This recording does not appear on so many &#34;best of all time &#34; lists for nothing. To me this is, and will always be, the staple of my Jazz collection. It has an appeal that has lasted at least three generations. It goes beyond classic, it is a recording masterpiece that just never gets old. If your Jazz collection does not have this in it, I recommend you get you get a copy. It also should never be chopped up in a compilation, it should be tasted and enjoyed as it is. Like I said, not only classic, &#34;masterpiece&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|The very first time I played Minecraft PE, I had so much trouble with the controls that I hated it. Plus there weren't even beds back then. Ever since the latest update (0.6.1 I think.. the one where they added signs) The game has become an addiction for me. The controls were redone (and they are really well done this time) and there are several items in the game now to keep it from being boring. Also, you can play multiplayer across platforms; I play multiplayer on my Kindle Fire HD with my kids (in the same world) who play on an iPhone and iPod. I love this game now and have trouble putting it down once I have started a game. Also runs flawlessly for me on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00000IL29|5.0|Just as &#34;In a Silent Way&#34; is the corner stone of any 1965 to 1975 collection, this is right along side it. It too should never be broken up in pieces. A lot of recording era. was &#34;sit down&#34;, are you ready, lets take off and create. No overdubbing or retakes. This remastered version is sensational. Nothing is lost or no filler added. This not peanut butter, and jelly, it is caviar. Listen to it enough, and it becomes beluga caviar. It will never be duplicated. Buy it, listen to it through head phones and treasure Mr. Hancock way before he went MTV with &#34;Rockit&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best computer game of all time.Now it's able to travel in your pocket..And so worth $6.99. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005614M|5.0|This proves to me that the best &#34;Traditional&#34; Jazz was created during this time. Of , I am not a fan of &#34;Bitches Brew&#34; or &#34;Live Evil&#34;. That being said, I believe Miles and all his contemporaries &#34;Chased the Voodoo Down&#34; during this era, before they plugged in their amps and did so much heroine that they sought of got off the rails. That is an opinion, not a fact. I believe that louder is not better, and these guys could get your foot and your mind tapping without volume or drugs. I wish they knew that, Miles might still be with us.  Together with &#34;Kind Of Blue&#34; and &#34;In a Silent Way&#34; this is the third of the Must Have Miles Davis trilogy......
B00846REIS|5.0|I was looking for something to read after Fifty Shades and this was the perfect series. It was definitely a great read! I can't wait for the next one!
B0000069NM|5.0|I had not been a fan of John Scofield's work until a heard a few cuts from this little gem. Sometimes it gets a little to much to the pop side. I have long admired his back up work with numerous artists, but he bops along real well on this CD. Just when I think he is about to enter the Herb Albert OMG world, it changes direction and gets down to the smoke filled Jazz club of 3am. That is what I like about this CD. John Scofield on his own, has CHOPS, make no mistake about it. On this remastered gem he proves that beyond a doubt with one tight little ditty. I also have seen lists of his work, that rated this hidden gem as a real find. It was for me, I think you might agree. Try it, it was definitely ahead of its time.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|The action was ok and the acting could have been better. The stories characters where not like able when writing a film you must have that to make the story of the film seem possible. a good directing try for RZA. I hope he has another try at it soon also out of all the characters Lucy Liu should not have met with a end like that.The kun fu movies of the past are timeless and pricless. I grow up watching the great bruce lee and others and no one can come close to those movies.
0425263916|5.0|I have read all of the Crossfire novels so far from Sylvia Day.  I find these much better written than the Fifty Shades of Grey series that I found quite redundant after the first book.  This series has a lot of hot romance and keeps the reader engaged throughout the story.  They are a hard series to put down and I can not wait for the Entwined With You novel that will be coming out in June 2013.
B0089OBLDO|2.0|After buying one of these and hearing initial feedback it seemed great. I'd like to precede this review by saying this product does not work with MadCatz products (it might work for some, but in general, stay away). I got this because I help run the metro Detroit fighting game community tournaments and we needed a cheap solution to players who like to play on Sony DualShock 3 controllers, but needed to play on Xbox 360.<br /><br />This seemed to be the cheapest solution BY FAR. However, it wasn't long before it started messing up.<br /><br />This adapter will eventually cause frequent electrical shorts when you use a DualShock3 to play on Xbox 360. Electrical shorts cause the Xbox Home button to trigger. This pauses the game and can cost you a match in a fighting game tournament.<br /><br />It does not always do this. Sometimes players will play on certain Xboxes all night with no issues. However with the majority of Xboxes this issue will always occur. We've tried running it through USB hubs. We've tried combinations of opponents using arcade fight sticks (draw more USB power) and regular game pads. I've tried opening them to examine for issues. I've tried contacting MayFlash.<br /><br />Nothing has worked and these adapters are considered mostly useless in our community now. However, THEY DO WORK GREAT FOR OTHER CONTROLLERS. DualShock2's or other pads work great. 360 controllers work great on Playstation 3. I used a DualShock1 as a PS3 controller at home. I use my PS2 dance pad on my computer with this (not the greatest latency, however).<br /><br />JUST DON'T PURCHASE THIS FOR USE WITH MADCATZ PRODUCTS OR DUALSHOCK 3'S.<br /><br />The XCM adapters don't have issues with DualShock3's like this, and I've heard some good things about Cronus devices. Both are unfortunately much more expensive than this. Mayflash almost hit the mark!

B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This book was a nice read. I didn't understand it sometimes, but still very exciting! This book deserves to be a classic!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|First time reading William Landay. I liked his style of writing and will definitely try his other books. This story takes you along on the downhill journey of a husband and wife as their 14 year old son is charged with murdering a classmate. The author draws the reader in to share these poor parent's  emotional roller coaster ride with his impeccable writing. At times, the trial seems to lag a little, but that did not diminish my compulsion to find out what was going to happen next. The final chapters take some real twists and turns leading to an ending that is totally unexpected.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is super cute and fun. The graphics are adorable. I love watching the little ponies running around !!!

B003TSEEDY|2.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower was a quick and easy read. For the most part, it was engaging. But overall, it falls into the continually emerging genre of Overrated Angst-Ridden Teenage Fiction. Honestly, not a lot of originality here. It would be nice to read a book about a well-adjusted teenager for once. They do exist.
B000FA675C|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series. The da Vinci code is a heart pounding thriller and so much fun to read that you forget you're learning something at the same time. I've read the Da Vinci Code at least four times and it never stops being an exciting read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I luv it. Accept 4 the joining  game part. It does not work on other devices. Fix that and it is perfect

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|My first book I've read by Richard Dawkins. He presents very professional, factual, and rational arguments for every point in his book. Even if you are deeply religious, I would recommend reading it, as it will help to either sway you away from religion or make you feel more devoted to your god of choice. Great book. Can't wait to read more from him!

B0000CDJPQ|4.0|I bought a Mac mini which has one FW800 port. I had a FW400 drive and an iSight camera. This connector was the bridge to get my iSight connected to my Mac min. My only issue is that the FW800 end seems a bit loose when plugged into the Mac.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|This is not a review of the actual film (which I would give 5 stars to), but the new 3D release.  I watched it last night and the transfer is absolute garbage.  There are a few select scenes that look crisp and fantastic but for the most part everything is VERY grainy.  Talking like worse than VHS quality grainy.  Very disappointing.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Not sure at first.  Wife brought home recommendation.  But the movie picks up and handles the theme of aging in a sensitive yet realistic way that makes one laugh.  The scenes of India, the enthusiasm of the Indian actors, the whole culture balanced realism with human element.  A Western person seeing the crowds and obviously a different lifestyle is struck with the universal human element.  A thoughtful and entertaining movie.
B007VYAJAE|4.0|Great footage and interviews. Too much focus on his personal quirks and not enough on how the music developed, except Chris Blackwell trying to justify his adding guitar overdubs and faster tempos in an attempt to appeal to rock audiences.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|My second one.  Carried my kindle around in the first one and coffee stains, etc.  Although originally bought as a protective cover, found that I can use the strap on the side with my belt so can carry with me.  Don't dare carry it around when out, lay it down, invite someone to &#34;borrow&#34; it.  So, when shopping trip with wife, use belt, have my library with me.  Feel a little strange.  Rather large.  But, heck, not that fashion conscious.  When in a sport coat or suit, not noticeable under coat.  If I am into not being weird, wear my sport coat.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|This is the third time I have watched this movie.  It brings some closure to the Firefly series, which was much too short a run.<br />Follow the exploits of the Serenity crew as they take their hesitant but heroic battle to the Alliance over a mistake the Alliance created which has far reaching consequences.  I'll watch it again or buy it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Exactly what I wanted.  A good dictionary, but search is easy.  Start typing in word and gives options.  Will bring up word instantly.
B002I9K2JK|5.0|I am so in love with this album. I had the CD already and decided I needed the vinyl. It's beautiful.
0316069434|4.0|THE BLACK BOX:In 1992 Bosch found Ann Jespersen's body killed in LA riot. Ann was war freelance journalist(from Denmark). Riot cases were unsolved.<br /><br />Bosch get the cold case after 20 years. Hardly there were clues, except a bullet.<br />Now with improved ballistic technology Bosch is able to find the gun that killed Ann. Gun was manufactured in Italy and used by Saddam's Republican guards. During 2002 there was an anonymus call made to the department to<br />know where abouts of the case. Upon tracking down gun and this phone call and some pictures taken by Ann during Desert Storm war in Iraq, Bosch finds the missing link.<br /><br />Upon tracing the missing link, Bosch comes to know that Ann was not killed in the riot.<br /><br />A picture taken by Ann during Desert Storm helps Bosch as Black Box to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Great plot setup, interestingly mystery unwinds. Michael Connelly has not upset me so far,although I find his legal thrillers better.<br /><br />I like character Bosch, relentless, fearless detective, takes the case personally and goes on a daunting pursuit.<br />As usual there's portion of Bosch's personal life, office politics etc., all add well to the story though.<br /><br />Recommended....?, Yes.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|This movie was pretty good, but the reason my kids wanted us to see it was for the amazing visual effects. We set up the Amazon video on demand and it started out ok, but with certain scenes it looked awful. The white hart in the fairy wood looked like a white blur, and only looked majestic for a 1-2 second close up scene. The kids talked about some of the details in the witch's costume (wow, those are actually bird bones on her dress) but we could't see them. This made a 360p Youtube video look high quality. What a waste! Now we'll have to rewatch it on disc - if we can tolerate Charleze's acting and awful accent again. Amazon you need to fix your technical problems. Netflix is clearly eating your lunch when it comes to streaming HD or even SD content!!!
B000NMW6M0|1.0|One of the oddest movies I have seen. So many bizarre scenes that you keep asking, why, what's the point?
1846074533|3.0|Even though I am a Dr nut, I didn't particularly like this story. I prefer the stories in which he faces his standard foes, like the daleks.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Most of these songs I have already heard on the radio. I bought the deluxe edition for the song The Boxer, which is excellent. Great for listening to in the car, or at work.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Our family loved this movie.  It was fun for my 4 year old but we as adults enjoyed it as well. It is funny but has a sweet daddy/daughter relationship story line.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love this site.  So many interesting items to see and learn.  The amount of knowledge on this site is great.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie was awful!  I would rank it as the worse movie ever!!!  We only watched about the first 20 minutes and turned it off.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Surprisingly entertaining with some genuinely funny dialogue for adults as well as the younger audience it is aimed at. Very clever without the typical stereotypes in so many movies of this genre. What Glee could have been
B0084U0IEG|5.0|A fine, realistic portrayal of the era and the people in the web of the security establishment. It is always a pleasure to read Mcewan's books.
1401941893|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this. The book ended up being not written very well. I think Miranda meant well and seems like a good person. But the book seems like the book isn't very deep and she talks about very basic simple things, there is no depth. Most of the things she talks about and recommends are cliche. Half of the book is just one affirmation and \\"power thought\\" per page.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is my second favorite case.  I typically use my kindle for reading -- however when on a trip I love this case as it is great for both portrait and horizontal viewing.<br /><br />The coners lock the kindle securely to the case.  The strap provides both a secure closure of the case put also something to help hold the device when reading in portrait mode.<br /><br />The outside is easy to wipe down is something spills.<br /><br />Overall great case -- one of THE best \\"standing\\" case I've used.<br /><br />Since I mainly read with my kindle my favorite case is [[ASIN:B008ULPBJG Verso Trends Darwin Croc Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Red (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]]
B00A6D5GBE|1.0|This game is extremely boring, and I have to describe how boring in at least 20. I found no enjoyment in manipulating platforms so the character could auto walk to the destination. Art is great, game play is as bland and boring as they come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone might want to download this app it's so awesome it blew my mind it might blow your mind to
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Pretty decent movie. I have seen it before but decided to watch it again. Reminded me of some things I've seen in combat myself, but nothing has been as good as saving private Ryan. Not the best experience in my lifetime but an experience I relate to at times especially when I wonder about \\"what if\\" is when I watch these movies...<br />Anyway it's a decent movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It really was too much to read all the detailed bedroom scenes. I found myself reminiscing about my own adventures.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Gerard Butler does a great job as the Phantom.  Great movie to pop in for a romantic night with the wife.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Fresh, smart, and brilliant. An eye opener. A courageous and disturbing, painfully honest chapter about abortion. The definition of feminism explained.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This is a long movie about a pilot that gets loaded up on booze and coke and then crashes an airplane.<br /><br />Mainly during the film he tries to convince others that no one else could of landed the plane, and that drugs weren't a factor in the crash.<br /><br />Basically he lies his ass off the whole time, and then feels guilty in the end and admits that his life is a mess.<br /><br />He goes to jail.<br /><br />He'll probably not be able to fly again in the sequel.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Once you get into this so called game you can't get out -and it tries to get you to buy $50 extras..
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great movie.  This movie had a lot of action.  I was surprised that there wasn't more cussing.  It was a nice surprise.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Good film for all ages makes you laugh.  Good animated film.  It wasn't a scarry film.it should win Oscar for anitmation top film.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|It's my favorite SciFi series and Amazon Prime is one of the only streaming service that has it and the HD quality is great for big screens !
B009VB97EY|5.0|Its for adults only.  Very hood film and the stars are great.so see it soon as you can.its rated R for a good reason.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Loved playing downstairs on computer. Really enjoy playing on Kindle. This is a great app. Would definitely recommend this app.<br /><br />Rita
B002M87V0A|5.0|I love this great classic.  The stars are great and so is the story.  I own on DVD.  I regimens to all to watch.
B00338QENI|3.0|This book points out the tragicly dismissive way Black patients were treated in the 40's-50's, and the total lack of patient education, or involvement in decisions that were made concerning their treatment and the use of their cells.  I felt frustration for this family that seemed to have little education, and hadn't been told what had happened to Harriet's cancer cells.  Even at the end it sounded like they didn't have a real understanding of what had happened, or the impact of Harriet's cells.  The book bogs down halfway through, and I found it hard to stay interested in finishing it.  I pushed through, but I think the story could have been presented differently.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|Definitely an entertaining read! I couldn't help but relate to some of the things mentioned! Keep the bro code alive, folks!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins has a great series here, and it engages the reader from page one till the end.  Great futuristic topic, and the twists and turns of the story keep the reader engaged.  I'm so glad I read it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Hands down the best Bond movie to date. I'm a big fan of the spy series and love past films with prior Bonds, but Skyfall captured the idealism of Bond and enhanced what these movies represented into the modern perspective. I highly recommend the film to any Bond fan, but to anyone looking for a great action flick with amazing set-pieces and meaning dialogue; you cannot go wrong.<br /><br />The combo set (blu-ray/DVD/digital copy) remains to be one of the best deals when purchasing the film. Still at a very low price, you get both the SD and HD versions, along with a digital copy. Technically you get two digital copies; UV and itunes. I see the pros and cons with both versions, but it is nice to have the choice. The movie looks beautiful and one of the best blu-ray quality films released this year.<br /><br />Don't think, just buy!
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a great updated Sherlock Holmes.  Acting is great.  Sherlock's mind is still racing ahead of mine.  Wish they had done more episodes within the series.  Can't wait for Series 2.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling has shown us she can write a good story entirely different than her earlier Harry Potter series. She tells a realistic tale that is a slice of &#34;council flat&#34; daily life in England. These are ordinary people living their ordinary lives with all their human faults and their own selfish concerns. These people live at the lower levels of the economic and social scale and their stories are not the stuff of magic and adventure.  Vacancy is gripping in the way it reveals the thoughts and emotions of the characters, and tells how their interactions with each other drive the story to a sad end. J.K. Rowling has written a story of real life that is just as interesting as Harry Potter's imaginary world.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|A poorly written book. I don’t see there is any story to tell throughout the book except the ill sex scene. Really, this is a book that is not worthwhile to read. I felt it was a waste of time and money.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  Great Season and I loved getting it before it aired on PBS.  I can't wait until next season.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This is a nice little app that does just what I needed.  Improvements would be to fix the pdf creation, and let the text box grow to the size of the page that you're creating, fix the erase function to only erase pixels rather that an entire object.<br /><br />I look forward to improvements and upgrades
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't typically enjoy reading non-fiction stories about war or military, but this book had me hooked from the first page. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Im using a nexus 7, have this app installed and now all of a sudden it will not let me update and says that my device is incompatible. What a crock. How is the app i am using right now compatible (i am typing this review on it right now) and magically the update is incompatible. Pure garbage.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is the cutest feel good movie I've seen in awhile and Timothy Olyphant is just crazy in this! His hair alone, just makes you laugh the entire time you're watching him. Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert are so cute with their love story - just great. I highly recommend this film to everyone.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|The &#34;loops&#34; and &#34;twists&#34; of the characters made fascinating reading.  Kept me on my toes and my interest was always peeked.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This film is the kind of film that makes movies wothwhile. Every aspect is excellent; the acting, the directing, the writing, both story and screen play, and the photography. Only watch this movie if you want to be entertained and uplifted. ENJOY!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I was so excited to see a My Little Pony app and I immediately downloaded it for play - it's innocent right? Only a few minutes after my kids were playing I received an email that they had purchased extra gems - they had NO idea they were actually charging it on my credit card! No password for the account was needed and I cannot cancel my order. I am VERY upset about this so be careful before your kids play and realize that they can purchase gems on your credit card without a password!! At least he chose the $10 option and not the $100 option!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|The action sequence in the beginning of this film is incredible! The DW charachter is the most capable I have ever seen, in an impossible circumstance, and despite the fact that he is drunk and on coke. The rest of the film sees him in a self destructive, alcohalic, arrogant, stuper. He's eventially set up to get off scott free and be called a hero, and then confesses for a non-reason. Maybe it's ten percent terrific, then ninety percent depressing and stupid. Please don't let me spoil it for you, unless, of course, you'd prefer to watch something worthwhile.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great reading app as are all the versions I've download, e.g. iPhone, laptop. I haven't used it much as a study tool or anything, but I love the variety of translations and the ease of use.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|A lot like playing Mario.  Played for quite a while before putting down. I will be playing again and again.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It was delivered on time and it works fine. It's hard to get that little connector in the Kindle Fire HD hole, but that's not the cables fault.
0061989142|5.0|This book went into way more detail & was longer than I expected, which was great! Even if you think you know style, this is a cute little reader that you won't want to put down! I use it as a bathroom piece :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining..... One of the best Series I have ever seen. Watching this series was the highlight of my show watching day.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I own all of the Puzzle Quest products and love them. Such a great value for the money. Simply hours upon hours of play time. Buy it you won't be sorry!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Kept me in suspense, has a good plot and would watch this one again. I like the whole movie acting was real good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love books that keep me guessing...this one definitely did. Well written but a fast read because you feel like you are just listening in on conversations.  I would love to see a follow up book....
B003ASLJQS|5.0|really enjoyed movie and the acting was great also. A fantastic story, and will be watching this movie again from time to time
B009HELT3C|3.0|This movie was Okay... the Young agent K was pretty good, but the old guys obviously phoned this one in.<br /><br />If I hadn't paid to see it, I would have  given it a four!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Just what I expected and wanted I have no problems with this product and would recommend this product to anyone interested in  this type of item.  Thanks and shop on.
B00003CXI1|5.0|We upgraded our VHS to the DVD version and received it quickly. Would recommend this product to others. My daughters are big Harry Potter fans.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Just what I expected and wanted I have no problems with this product and would recommend this product to anyone interested in  this type of item.  Thanks and shop on.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I always like Lois Mcmaster Bujold's works as the follow unpredictable paths and come to very satisfying conclusions.  This book is enjoyable because it follows one of the side characters in the Vor series.
0843174218|5.0|This book i bought it for my little boy since i read it to him before he goes to bed. He loves them!
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|After not enjoying the second in this series as much as I enjoyed the first, I was a bit skeptical about reading this one but thoroughly enjoyed it especially the ocean bound part of the saga.  I did think that maybe by the end Claire's adventures were a bit far fetched but maybe Diana Gabaldon was trying to spread the mishaps and tricky situations between major characters.<br /><br />I am by now sick of the description of Jamie's 'long, straight nose' though.  I think we get it, along with the fact that he has hair which is 7 different shades of red all in one.<br /><br />A friend recommended this series to me and I have now passed that recommendation on to many more.... looking forward to buying the next installment.
0843175109|5.0|would buy again. :)
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My title says it all.  If you enjoy a solid drama with a humorous, charming, intelligent story and a great cast of characters, then you will definitely enjoy this movie!
0843176881|5.0|This book i bought it for my little boy since i read it to him before he goes to bed. He loves them!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is one of the better hidden object games. Great story line. I hope there is a sequel soon. Does anyone know how often G5 comes out with hidden object games? They are highly addictive.
0843174781|5.0|This book i bought it for my little boy since i read it to him before he goes to bed. He loves them!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Great series, have ordered season 2, sat down to watch disc one, could not stop untill we had watched all of the discs
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this for my 6 year old daughter, and she loves it! She plays every night and just has a ball!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a great series. The Downton Abbey collection is a must for anyone that loved 'Upstairs Downstairs' like my wife & I.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had purchased several episodes of Downtown Abbey from iTunes.  Each one would take three hours to download and cost 2.99.  I bought this one on amazon for 1.99 and it streamed instantly.
B003RV43X4|5.0|gREAT DEALER FAST AND EFFICENT RECIEVE WHAT WAS PROMISED I WOULD ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS DEALER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely one of Sparks best. Thoughtfully written and a real page turner. I haven't quite finished it yet but it's not because I don't want to!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. The mix of history with a good story. It was hard to put down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kids love playing this game! Challenging and constantly changing. Just wish the power up screwed up nite frequently without having to purchase the upgrade.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|For the price (about $30), these exceeded expectations. They're comfortable and not too heavy. The pads could be a bit softer though. The sound is really good compared to my old headphones. The cord is a bit weak. I accidentally ran my chair over the cord and some of the insulation came off. No huge problem, fixed it with duct tape. The plastic on the wings has cracked a bit too, but It doesn't seem to be affect anything. They sound great and they're pretty cheap. I'm happy with my purchase.
6305428557|3.0|Love Hugh Grant and all the actors were good, but the story dragged a bit and I actually lost interest and left the room at least once.  Usually I will watch a film again, if it has other good ratings, so I'll do that soon.  Might be the English type of storytelling that is unfortunately lost on me at times.
B000002AGN|5.0|My record collection was stolen in 1964. This album is a favorite, and it's wonderful to listen to it again. LOVE IT.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|This was a great movie! Originally my husband and I rented it but then the next day we let our kids watch it. The whole family enjoyed it! Very inspirational.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The story line is quite predictable but it was a fun movie to watch. Not a bad choice for a family movie time.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|One of my favorite shows. The premise reels you in, the story line hooks you, and you're a flopping fish hoping for your next breath of The Walking Dead goodness.  This is one of those shows that you will sacrifice a night out and a full night's sleep for just so that you can watch it during its first run (although you'll probably DVR it anyway so that you can re-watch it several times before the next episode!)
B007GE2H3G|4.0|It's a well made movie. The details of animated characters and scenes were impressive.<br />I'm hoping to see the sequel soon. :)
B004G6009U|5.0|We love this movie!  Good for ages 4yo to 40yo. Disney's spin on the story of Rapunzel is captivating.  It's child-friendly enough for a preschooler to love and has enough clean, adult humor for adults to enjoy as well. A definite necessity for any little princess' movie collection.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love the entire Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan. Perhaps this one didn't have the flash that &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; did, or even the solidity of &#34;Batman Begins,&#34; but I think it was a solid film, with an engaging story, and very great cast and crew.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|So glad I read this book! Sad, happy, motivating and inspiring for anyone who loves to read a good life lesson book, this is for you!
B001U6YI92|5.0|The movie itself is great. However the time listed of 161 minutes is not the extended version. The extended version runs 2hr. 59 min.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Very very good. Very informative. I loved the characters. What a strange story. Serena is one messed up girl. I loved the last boyfriend.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I bought this based on the raving reviews, along with a few other books at the same time.  By the time I got to this book, I had forgotten why I bought it and as I read more was increasingly confused.  This book is a Walking Disaster.  There is not much about it that is Beautiful.  Abby (with the last name Abernathy - really?  Just say that out loud, it's annoying all by itself) comes across as an immature whiny self-absorbed little girl.  Travis clearly shows her from the beginning how much he loves her and that he would do anything for her, yet, she continues to pick fights over nothing.  There ws more than one time that I was tempted to simply walk away from this book - but I had to finish because I never give up.  I should have.  The whole thing just borders on the ridiculous.  I seriously thought this was written by a 19 year old.  It certainly comes across that way. It is at least clearly targeted to that audience.  The overt drinking, smoking and underground fighting are not as \\"cool\\" as they are meant to come across as.  It's hard to find Travis romantic when he is described as reeking of tobacco and whiskey.  What a turn on... not.  Don't waste your time with this one.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Quirky and geeky. with some surprising actors.  A good B movie with some really funny scenes.  Worth the rental money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm completely addicted to this series.  Such great acting and a wonderful story.<br />It's amazing how detailed everything is portrayed.
B00846F1YW|5.0|you can't go wrong with a Nevosoft game. I always love them. This is my first one on the Kindle Fire. almost as good as on the PC
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought this book started off really slow in the beginning but after you get passed it, the book fats really good and I loved the ending!!!! I would recommend this book!
0385535147|3.0|John Grisham knows big concept stories. THE RACKETEER is another such tale from the first page to the open-ended ending. Sure, it’s easy to find fault with this novel—and it has a few—but it does provide enjoyment, along with a somewhat unlikeable main character. He does know how to write a page-turner, as I found myself flipping pages with effortless ease. But I did feel as though the story could have been a bit more fleshed out; the characters were a bit more skeletal than some of Mr. Grisham’s earlier fare.<br /><br />I do like the tried and true concept that is used here, and in other Grisham page-turners, where the little guy sticks it to the big corporation. But I probably would have enjoyed this novel a bit more if Malcolm Bannister had been a nicer guy. Instead, we have a guy who spent five years in prison, and the metal gates and cement walls have hardened him a bit too much. He’s out for justice and revenge in every sense of the word, and he’s willing to run over whatever and whoever manages to stand in his way.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a good page-turner, you’ll certainly get that here. If you want Grisham at his best, you might want to check out some of his earlier work.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|In the spirit of Bond, as always, awesome. Keeps you waiting for the next one. A must see. Craig is a natural.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I just wish there was more games and better instructions. For instance, the chest... how do u get it and open it?
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Couldnt put it down!  I love Shirley MacLaine and still do. However this book answers does a great job of describing Sachi Parker's most unusual and to some degree, sad life.
B004MKLRQA|4.0|Painful read to know these things happen, but worth the read.  At times the way it is written is tough also.  I would read it again for the realistic view that we don't always we see out there in other countries. It is also a short read. So give it a try. For a longer read try Infidel.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great CD and a compliment to an artist with a fantastic voice! I keep playing it even when I've gone on to other kinds of music!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|This film worked in my old Polaroid camera and I was afraid they stopped making it. Picture came out good but developing seemed to take longer than I remember. Still happy I found it and it works!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really good game really fun but not very realistic. if you want to get use to horses then this is cool
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|We typically like all Denzel Washington movies, but the tragic theme of this one moves it down the scale a notch from the normal 4 or 5 star ratings we give to his work.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very fun game. I thought it would be to easy,to my surprise it's actually very challenging. I would recommend this game to any one that likes puzzle games.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Unvelievable opening chase scene keeps you on edge of your seat right from the start.  Jason Staham make a great Bond, perhaps the greatest Bond of all time (Sean Connery is a very close second).  This is a riviting attention-grabber!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wow. I decided to read this book because I saw they made it into a movie and I'm so glad that I did. It was a great love story and about being able to trust someone. And also very suspenseful but in a good way. The only thing I didn't like was for me,it took to long for the story to pick up pace. I loved the ending how everything came together.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|the product was good quality,have enjoyed it over and over. it is a<br />very good history lesson. the product was shipped quickly.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. The sounds are very relaxing, and I love how you can layer them. It is very neat. This is the best relaxing sound app I have downloaded on my kindle fire hd. One thing I don't like is the monk chant. It's creepy! Relaxing is the last word I would use to describe it. haha! Other than that, it rocks.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book was great. At some parts were funny and others were sad. I suggest this book to people who like dystopian societies.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This bio reads like a novel.  It is one of the best books that I have ever read.  I am amazed by the depth of the man.  We had a caring president who had more than his share of problems.  Yet he lead with great ability.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is okay, but I thought it would be like a REAL dictionary, like you could actually look up words. It's useful for looking up words in the book that your reading, but that's about it.
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|One of the unique rechargeable in its type.<br />Easy to use<br />Nice price<br />Not so sensible to low light conditions, but good as the first camera

B005IT0V8O|5.0|I keep it alongside my keyboard when I am writing historical novels. It looks more like something ready for discard now after fifteen years and three books, but that only verifies its value and frequent use.

B008NW67E0|4.0|I love watching these guys storm the Bastille with acoustic guitar, banjo, accordion, and drums. They remind me of the time U2 finally broke into the mainstream.<br /><br />I've read countless praiseworthy reviews since 2010, and wanted to experience them myself. They are definitely NOT a waste of time, and are worthy of people's attention.
0618918248|5.0|This is the second time that I have read this book. It is packed with such insightful, intelligent statements and highly educated perspectives on the subject matter. It really put things into proper perspective for me! This book will undoubtedly change your religiousity!
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I bought this album, and Babel simultaneously to get up to speed with this band, and find out why Ray Davies, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Elton John, and T Bone Burnett have all wanted to perform with them both onstage and in the studio.<br /><br />My curiosity is satisfied, and I'm glad they're causing such a nice ripple in such a fickle industry. I intend to perform some of this material in the near future.

1936608898|5.0|If you are looking to change your health for the better and learn how to love food in a healthy way, this book is for you. It has totally changed the way I eat and how I think about food. The book is easy to read and it is easy to follow the plan since the rules of doing a Whole30 are clear - there is no wiggle room. You are either on the program or you are not. I am currently on day 24 of my first Whole30 and I have lost weight, gained boundless energy, and have not once felt hungry. After years of yo-yo dieting, I have finally cemented a relationship with food that I know will ultimately lead me to my 'natural' healthy weight without counting a single calorie. Just lots of tasty meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, and healthy fats! I have decided to do a Whole60 and will continue eating this way 99% of the time when I'm done.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I got this as a movie dvd. It was great, but everything about Lincoln is very good. He was a very complex thinker of which we need more of

B000GL1BHO|5.0|I got this for our two and half year old who requested a pteranodon for Christmas.  It is very well made, beautifully detailed, much nicer than her other plastic dinos.  My husband is a paleontologist and thinks it is very nicely done, so it even wins over the professionals.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read this to find out what are the excitement was about. Well, I found out and I am sorry I bothered. It was well written and even had some suspense built, but I felt it was a waste of my time to read it.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Anyone who likes Harry Potter or has a big imagination would love these movies. They're brilliant. I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd (Potterhead) and I was so excited when this came that I was jumping up and down. (I'm 22, mind...) The only thing is that if you are expecting special bonus features or anything, it won't be in this. It's just the movies. So the games and stuff that come on the second disc in the individual films isn't included.<br />I'm SO EXCITED to make my husband watch with me. (:
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I always love angry birds and was cool I got this one add free. My only complaint is this game is really hard compared to all the other ones! It is fun and it was free so who could really complain!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was disappointed.  Found the constant use of the &#34;F&#34; word offensive.  Character development took too long...didn't ever really grab me at all...kept waiting to &#34;really get into it&#34; and never  did.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Having read The Secret, and reading the stories of those people whose lives the law of attraction has changed, this book was mentioned many times.  I had to get it.  I couldn't put it down.  Thank you Rhonda, for the beauty of this book.  It has made me realize so many things that I take for granted.  It has also given me great ideas for practicing gratitude in my life.  I will be giving a copy of this book to several people.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Just like you would expect it was all hartwarming and sweet.  Cool concept.  Plus it was awesome to see all the oldschool game characters hanging out.  All the kids will love it, and the adults won't want to rip their hair out after watching it a hundred times.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|I would have to say i was way more pleased with this movie than expected. The music and singing was great and the movie had some very funny parts. &#34;Fat Amy&#34; makes this movie as good as it is but this would still stand as a good movie without it.

B001ENOB8Y|2.0|Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good.  I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.<br /><br />1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.<br /><br />2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.<br /><br />3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because \\"you need them.\\"<br /><br />4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.<br /><br />5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.<br /><br />6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the \\"I won't kill\\" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.<br /><br />7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes tosuspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.<br /><br />8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.<br /><br />The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.  But, being honest about the entire show: how sustainable can a show called \\"Prison Break\\" be?
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I loved this movie for the accuracy that they played between the future character and the present character. The make up on Joseph to look like Bruce Willis, although not always perfect, did look pretty real at times. Also, he did very well at catching some of Bruce's idiosyncrasies. The concept was very cool and very well put together. I enjoyed thias movie a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was very good.  I liked The Hunger Games best of all three; but the reader needs to go through all the books to appreciate the entire story.  I was very reluctant to read these because the theme was disturbing to me; but a friend encouraged me, and am I glad I listened to her.  All the books had me captivated from beginning to end.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I received this DVD as a gift from my husband. Amazing! I watched this DVD more than 20 times now, and I still am going to. It is one of the best gift I have ever received. I no longer keep CDs and DVDs in my house, but this one is extra special. There's always something interesting and refreshing each time I watch this benefit concert. It reminds me of the purity of heart and soul of George Harrison as reflected on his timeless music. The rest of the band are exceptionally amazing too; Russell and Clapton in particular. I will always keep this DVD and bring it with me whenever we go on vacation-- something worthwhile to share with friends and families. It is a treasure worth keeping.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This program was very well made and has a beautiful look to it. As ever, the Brits reign supreme when it comes to costuming and period productions in general. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the lack of effort to explain the history and historical persons in dialogue. Everyone in the scene knows what's going on, so you either have to know yourself what they're talking about, or look it up. It makes me want to re-read my copy of Sir Martin Gilbert's &#34;The Appeasers&#34;. Having said that, it is missing some of the dramatic tensions that make Downton Abby, the King's Speech, and Gosford Park so compelling/sexy. (And the AMPAS should give David Seidler another Oscar this year just on general principle, he is so incredibly talented.) Big ups to Julian Fellowes for artfully lighting the cultural fuse on the important history surrounding World War I, and the cultural implications of its fallout.

159514188X|2.0|I read this book in one setting and believing I was in it for a good read to end up being disappointed.  The Hannah Baker character was one-dimensional, depressing, and defeatist as she shared with the 13 people why she ended her life.  I had the hardest time feeling remorseful, pity, or sadness for her character through most of the book.  I could not find it in me.<br /><br />My first disappointment, she also seemed much too gullible into allowing new people in her life one after the other once one used her or treated her life crap.  I felt like she didn't learn her lesson especially after the episode that happens between her and Jessica in the early stages of the book.  The age old saying should had click into her brain somewhere, 'fool me once shame on you, fool me twice me.'  My biggest major aggravation with Hannah she clearly seemed to look for any excuse to end her life especially after witnessing a rape, a tragic accident, and pretty much allows self-destructive rape to happen upon her (whom she knew was bad news) to confirm those \\"slut-shaming\\" rumors since she wouldn't be alive much longer for more terror.  Aiy ya ya ya!  To top it off, she wanted everyone to figure her out, especially after her haircut/new look incident.  It was as if she was wanting people to run up to her and say, \\"Hannah are you depressed?  Please let me help you.\\"  Sorry, if you don't open your mouth how is anyone going to be able to help you!  She had many chances to try to seek help from others, especially with the boy Clay Jerkins who she had no problem treating like crap, and when she did she allowed an imperfect teacher/counselor Mr. Porter \\"misguide\\" her to her demise--she simply needed one more nail in her coffin.  Even Clay said it best about Hannah, \\"You wanted your world to collapse around you.  You wanted everything to get dark as possible.\\"  I couldn't agree more!<br /><br />While it's clear suicide is hard topic to discuss and face with some, especially today's social media teen culture -- this book does not do an effective job displaying the main character well since she did not TRY to have enough encourage to fight back, not just against others who ruined her life, but also to help herself and the author missed an opportunity to try make her a rootable character in that regards.  Mind you I like a good angsty, dark read at times, but the story was too much of a defeatist attitude and too revengeful for my taste to even try to take seriously.ia teen culture -- this book does not do an effective job displaying the main character well since she did not TRY to have enough encourage to fight back, not just against others who ruined her life, but also to help herself and the author missed an opportunity to try make her a rootable character in that regards.

0307454568|5.0|If you can push yourself through the first 100 pages of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the story is one of the best series I've read in a very long time. This is book three and the final of the series. Just don't give up because the first book starts so terribly slowly. I almost quit and it would have been a huge mistake. Book two is called, The Girl Who Played With Fire.
B000YJ85BI|2.0|This book pales in comparison to Old Man's War. A lot of dialogue between minor characters and the virtually infallible stars of the piece, zero sense of tension, and a focus which switches between local and universal and makes little impression in either. Problems are set up for the colonists and then forgotten in the broader context of the novel, like the 'werewolves' which are abandoned in the plot.

B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I love Karl Urban as Bones in Star Wars, but in this, his Grumpy Cat frown is almost comical.  It sort of grows on you by the end of the film (and makes more sense given the story).  The film overall has its moments -- a couple of slow-mo scenes here, a couple of quips there -- but the overall story just really doesn't have anything new to offer.  Well, maybe its particular variant of a dystopian future is one we have not seen. You might be better off re-watching the Matrix again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you haven't discovered Pinterest, don't delay. Instead of subscribing to numerous magazines for every hobby, avocation, vocation, and ideas, Pinterest lets you &#34;thumb&#34; through page after page of DIY projects, recipes, pithy sayings, photography, art, architecture, child care, fashion, and so much more. I have used it on my laptop, desktop, and now my Kindle Fire. The latter is best--just like picking up a magazine while waiting for an appointment and enjoying great graphic displays.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this is the best game that I have ever played.  I also own it on my computer ( brenbrit is my name ) . I have played it on iPad, Kindle, and iPod touch.  MCPE is very unrealistic, and that is what makes it so fun.  In real life, days do not last exactly ten minutes.  Also, in real life, there are no creepers, zombies, or skeletons with bows and arrows.  What I really like is that you can play with your friends.  When my friends and I play, we usually rob each other.  Overall amazing game.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|It's ok but it jumps around a lot and can be confusing. This book is full of second hand stories from those that were there. Some of it is factual history and some parts just perspective of those involved. The two things I learned that surprised me was that Steve was a cry baby when he didn't get his way and Woz was much more brilliant than I knew about. Steve was more lucky & less skilled than I imagined.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|If you like Mitch Alborn books, you won't be disappointed with this one.The concept of time and man's relationship to it, in any fashion, always leave the reader with something to think about.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Very enjoyable flick, even when the twists in the plot start to point you to the ending, it remained enjoyable and kept me engaged.  Great performance, good music.  Definitely would watch again!

B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie. I will admit the twist caught me off guard, and Jennifer Lawrence did a great job as she always does. Max (can't remember his last name) also had a solid performance. Sure, this movie is not an absolute hit but I found it enjoyable and any Jennifer Lawrence fan will as well.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Been playing this game for over a week now, this is my kind of game, but this game is glitchy.  It crashes frequently.  There's no save button; as a result, you'll loss your game progress quite often.<br /><br />As for the game play itself, it's slow.  Building your army will require a lot of resources and time.  For those who doesn't have time to wait, you can purchase coins and gold stars with actual money.  Prices range from $1.99 - $99.99.  Be careful though when purchasing coins or gold stars `cause you'll loose those when you lose your game progress.<br /><br />Edit 3/6/13:<br />The \\"collecting bounty\\" feature doesn't work on the kindle version of this game.  There's a quest in this game that I can't complete 'cause this feature doesn't work.<br /><br />Also, don't bother with the customer service.  A representative gave me the runaround when I asked to compensate for gold star lost for losing my game progress.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was entertaining and a good read, but I did not like the ending. I felt that it was well written all along and kept the suspense going, but once I got to the end, I felt like it was &#34;unfinished.&#34;
0792833686|5.0|I cannot review the movie, it was not for me it was a gift for someone else.  But the service was excellent.  The DVD arrived very quickly which is always important to me.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|This even had a poster included in the box.  I love it and am very pleased with the playback and poster (Awesome!) What more can I say.  Gotta be a Taylor Swift fan!
B004H4XLRE|5.0|Got this for Christmas for my Cars-obsessed toddler and he loved it. It works fine with Hot Wheels cars, too - plastic cars will go further than die cast, though. We haven't had any problems with it! My son is 3 and can work it on his own.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watched the first season on Netflix and was instantly hooked!  Didn't want to wait for possibly months for Netflix to get season 2 so I bought the download from amazon. Season 3 is just finished in the USA so I watched season 2 quickly to take advantage of the free online season3 until March 3rd.  Love the show
1423113462|5.0|Bought the set for my grandson for Christmas.  He is 11 yrs old.  Halfway thru book I and loves it
B00BETX5PS|5.0|It is a tad bit long for my taste, however, it was well made and the action keeps you interested in the multi-layed story.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|What a great idea!  Easy to use and I love having every CD I purchased (of recent years) right there in MP3 format on the cloud!  Love it!
B009X01C64|4.0|The cover is well padded and easy to attach.  It has several degrees of uprightness that one can choose, both for portrait and landscapr display.  I can use it pretty much hands-free on my lap while riding as a passenger in our car, and completely so while siting at our breakfast bar.  However, it does make the Kindle somewhat thicker and heavier to carry.
B004HD61KE|5.0|A very interesting book, lots of action and a good premise for the plot. It is hard to put this book down.
B000N5F6PG|5.0|I thought that I was purchasing it to own on my kindle. But I love this movie thats is why I was purchasing this movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great product, very minimal advertising; couldn't be happier with this app. Plays perfect on my Kindle. One of my favorites - now I know why so many people love ANGRY BIRDS!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a great series. I suggested it to anyone who is looking for something new to read. Its a story that is easy to get wrapped up in and all you want to do is finish to see what happens! But then feel like you need to go back and re-read the story and catch all the little things you might have missed.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|Warning: Spoilers follow.  Read at your own risk.<br /><br />There's very little I can say here that hasn't been covered by the other reviewers, so I'll just add a small note about the ending.  There's another possible anagram for &#34;Franz Ferdinand&#34; - &#34;Darn Far - Find Zen&#34;. Something to think about.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love this show!  The characters are so dynamic that the writers build sympathy even for the ones you despise.  I can't get enough of the story!  Very addicting and compelling.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|&#34;Every couple of months, Crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around to all the other plants. 'Say goodbye to your friend,' he'd say to them. 'He just couldn't cut it. . . '<br /><br />Then he would leave the flat with the offending plant, and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the flat.<br /><br />The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and beautiful in London. Also the most terrified.&#34;<br /><br />This book is exactly what you would expect from Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett writing a parody fanfic of the Book of Revelation. It is hilarious throughout, and the musings on human nature and morality spread throughout, though said in jest, can be quite thought provoking. The random tangents that the authors go on while telling the story would themselves be worthy of a separate book, and it is, overall, one of the most quotable books I have ever read (along with, appropriately, a few written by Chesterton).<br /><br />I highly recommend it to any fan of fantasy, or to any fan of either of the two authors involved.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put it down. I was shocked my the surprise in he end! Definitely a great read. I recommend it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|When I opened this novel, I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know what genre it was supposed to be, I didn't know how long it was (I read on a Kindle, and thus couldn't see the physical size of it), and I had never heard of, let alone read anything by, Robin Sloan. Therefore, to say it exceeded expectations would be entirely meaningless, since I had no expectations beyond there being an all-night bookstore run by a man named Mr. Penumbra. However, it was the type of book of which you'd say &#34;it exceeded expectations&#34;, so I'll say it anyway - this book exceeded my expectations. It had a little bit of everything - a massive parallel processing feat run by Google for my inner tech geek, a mysterious bookstore filled with literally cryptic books for the part of me that loves books and codes, a five hundred year old book cult for the part of me that loves fantasy, and more. The characters were all unique enough that it was fun seeing Clay calling in favors and using all of their special skills, and the mystery itself (the main part of the plot) was interesting enough to provide a draw to keep reading, even though it was not the best part of the book. The writing itself was above average as well, and I ended up with a number of quotes highlighted by the time I got to the end.<br /><br />Overall, I give it five stars, and I recommend it to any fan of the mystery-romance-bookstore genre, or anyone interested in giving that genre a try.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This is a very convenient way to update stock prices, obtain financial news and explore new stocks while traveling.  Navigating around the site is simple and intuitive.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story was all twisted, sad, happy, funny and different. After paying upwards of $10 for ebooks lately I was glad to find a unique story that kept my interest from beginning to end at a great price.
B005URRCUY|3.0|Good cd. Really enjoy &#34;Lonely Boy&#34;, rest of the cd doesn't live up to that song, but it's still a good cd.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good sharpener. Made all my knives sharp enough to trim hair off my arm with no problem. Plus its small and compact and can go with you anywhere. Highly recommended.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I LOVE this cd! It's permanently in my car stereo. Amazing from start to finish, and the songs are well written.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have never enjoyed a series so much....I am already on the fifth book so it's hard to remember where one ends and another one begins.  Jamie Fraser is by far the best hero in any book and the way he that he loves Claire just seems the way it ought to be! Love, love, love it...read it, it will not disappoint!
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|After falling in love with &#34;Babel&#34; I decided to try the prior cd. In my opinion, &#34;Babel&#34; is a much better cd; but I still really enjoy this one too!
B0040UAYI4|1.0|I am a tech kind of guy..fix my own computers..and was not able to make that think work.<br />For the average Joe out there I honestly do not think is a good choice.
B00760BPOC|5.0|complex story, interesting characters. Definitely recommended when you have time on your hands and are looking for an escape.  You will definitely want to read the follow-on books
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. Nicholas Sparks knows how to keep your interest. Once you get it in your hands you can't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie to compare to the story in the book. The 5 star rating is well deserved.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Like to play occasionally. But frustrated as I sometime feel I do not know the rules. My grandchildren like to play!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the weather channel App. It is very easy to understand and is very detailed. Glad I have it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game suggested by sister as a mind challenge. Like speed of game and am looking forward to playing again soon.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Everybody can learn out of this book because everyone is selling something to someone. For actual sales people, it is a must read if they want to succeed in sales these days.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game was suggested by a friend when I got my &#34;Fire&#34;. Enjoy playing, but have free version and the coins run out too quickly. Usually just wait 24 hours and try again. Not my favorite game.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast did a great job with this movie.  It was a little slow at times, but I definitely would watch again and recommend it.  I had really wanted to see this and was not disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like this ap and use often, but prefer to use my laptop for most of my Facebook use. I have not found a way to &#34;share&#34; pictures etc using my &#34;Fire HD&#34;.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I've been a Stones fan since the beginning, and I believe this is the 11th collection of previously released material (not counting the \\"Metamorphosis\\" and \\"Rarities\\" albums)and the best one to date. Personally, I would give it four stars, but for someone who wants only a gathering of highlights, this can't be beat. Fanatics may quibble with the surprising omissions (\\"Mother's Little Helper\\" in particular) or the inclusion of the atypical \\"As Tears Go By\\" or the comparitively odd \\"We Love You,\\" but truly knowledgeable Stones disciples will understand why they made the cut. Mick Jagger himself has reportedly overseen all compilations and live albums for several years now, which makes this selection of hits and key album tracks doubly interesting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this game each day. This is one of the 1st games I put on my &#34;Fire&#34;. Ease of use is best feature!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The subject is fascinating but the medical terminology was difficult for a non-medical reader to enjoy.  The author knows what he wants to say but has difficulty conveying his thoughts and descriptions.  This book is not for everyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy this ap very much. Like to be able to view weather of many different cities. East of use very good.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham. Entertaining but similar to other Grisham novels.  The outcome is predictable.<br /><br />Would recommend this book for easy reading.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to start the second book in the series-  it kept me reading!!!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is both challenging and fun!! You really have to pay attention to the levels and what is required to get to those places in time. I loved going back in time or hurrying forward options - they allowed you to get it right! Going back to get the all clear on the levels was fun too! Engaging and cute, this one will keep you occupied and wanting more.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|It was comical and also sad. Very interested. Grown up loved it also. I like these kinds of movies very much.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I bought this adapter to connect my very old Dell 17&#34; LCD screen (left over from a Dell desktop computer I bought in 2000 or so).  It worked beautifully, mainly because Apples can figure out this sort of attachment more easily than PC's can.  The only downside is that the screws on the Dell cable don't line up with the adapter's screw holes, so there is some risk of the monitor cable coming loose and killing the signal to the LCD screen.  It's happened a couple of times, but not recently.  Otherwise, everything is fine, and the Dell cable didn't screw into my old Dell laptop from 2008 anyway, so this probably isn't Apple's problem.  Otherwise, everything is OK, and this is well worth the money for the extra screen space.
0761536434|4.0|A bit on the just-a-tad delayed side but otherwise received it as described and it's a very enjoyable read and hard to put the blooming book down once you get started.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so much fun! You have to try to get the water to the pipe so Perry's water powered tube can work. Please buy it. Its worth the 99&cent;
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I follow quite a few blogs with Google Reader and wanted something similar on my Kindle Fire. I really wish the Google products were just in the app store, and assume there is some bickering going on that explains its absence.<br /><br />Since I can not use the proper Reader, I use gReader and enjoy it. It only took a moment to set it up and the feed refreshes fairly accurately (sometimes it'll not remove items I read on my laptop... other times it's perfect).
B00992CF6W|1.0|It starts blackscreen with an error, will not run on my tablet.  The demo ran fine, so makes no sense.  Formated and tried with stock tablet setup as well.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I loved the movie. the game also is fun. its boxing but with robots. the graphics are very good and I like the music
B00AFEY354|5.0|My favorite movie of 2012 and really amazing acting. Good growing up story with some bigger lessons thrown in that really helped me go through my life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it, The conplicated twists and turns and  the contention between the characters kept me gllued to the screen.
B0039NJTLQ|3.0|don't want to spoil it for others...it was interesting and good acting...just expected it to be a real affair with the brother and not just 1 little kiss...could have been great if she had to struggle with the decision of who to stay with
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Hands down the best flashlight I've tried! Not only Is the light coming from my camera flash nice and bright, the light from the face is amazing as well. This puts off enuff soft light so you can read and not disturb a soul near you. On top of that the permissions are truly minimally invasive. Not to mention its F R E E!!! Give it a try. You won't be disappointed
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Alice Munro writes like deep water runs. She leaves plenty of space for the reader to enter her worlds and plenty of reasons to want to be there. The surface is smooth and there is depth of insight and appreciation for the human condition.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I purchased this game on a whim and well lets just say that I could not stop playing it. The graphics are great and the game playing is wonderful. I only with that it been a little longer, but I continue to play the game over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hours of play great for young and old alike.  Very realistic graphics.<br />I would recommend to anyone who likes horses.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked the characters in this story , however, still the same story line as most books I've read lately. Bad boy, good girl image, with the horrows of their past . Still, enjoyed the book.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie that moves along quickly, Will be able to watch this one once a year! Get your kleenex ready!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|True to the first two seasons. All the pomp and circumstance, treachery, sorrow, and especially the humor of Maggie Smith, keep me waiting for season four.  A real classic,
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I was hesitant to order this movie for my granddaughters (ages 4 and 6) because I worried it would scare them, but my concerns were for nothing.  The girls loved the movie and laughed at the various &#34;monsters&#34; as much as I did.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|It's MIB number one, of course it's going to be good. - - - - - - !!*** alkfjd d
B00AF6B22E|5.0|The movie was at least as good as I expected it would be, based on seeing trailers on TV, the Apple Store and IMDB.  But Denzel Washington made it great by the way he portrayed the character.  I have always loved his acting, and I also, on a personal note, applaud his support of our military families.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|Our book club read this.  Enjoyed it very much.  Love to hear about the women during WWI and WWII.  This was well written with good character material.  A mystery with plenty of unexpected turns:)
B007REV4YI|4.0|This much anticipated movie didn't disappoint --- great character development both individually and the relationship between 007 and &#34;M&#34;.  Highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout is very intense, but it's only twenty minutes so I don't feel like I'm getting the results I could be if I were exercising longer. I realize that is part of the appeal. However, though my butt is kicked by this, I feel like I need to put in more time than twenty minutes.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love the show and this game compliments it perfectly. It does get challenging as well. A dollar well spent!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|This was a cute story, but not spectacular. It moved slowly; which, may have had purpose because CE 's character  was aged. I like the two supporting actors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, as a reaffirmed Christian, it was exactly what I needed to be able to read the Bible on the go and whenever I wanted to. I was recommended to try it from a friend and I am glad that I did.<br />There are so many plans you can read on this app or just read the bible itself.<br />I highly recommend it!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Fun fun fun :) really addicting, except when I got to world #8 I can't pass anything, it's super hard all of a sudden :/ but other than that loved it. Graphics on the kindle are sweet too :) .. I recommend it for anyone who lived Mario s a kid..
0767819659|5.0|Bought it for the grandkids to see but we love it too.  A good movie for the whole family.  There aren't very many movies out now that I would want to show to my little kids.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|The DVD seemed to be damaged.  Times of no sound, stopped and skipped. Poor quality.  Seemed to have been copied
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like to keep my cutting tools sharp and this tool works on all types of knives from kitchen one to pocket ones.  Works on serated one too.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|After I loaded it on to my kindle I played it and then got out. Haven't been able to play it since.
0790731452|5.0|My Grandson saw this on cable and begged me to play it again.  I couldn't so I bought it. I can't say enough how great this is!  I especially love how the Aliens are battled!  I know as a kid Country was played in our station wagon by Dad and I swore I was going to Die!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is great on the easy beginner parts.  It was real hard for me once I got past phase one and got into more difficult puzzles.  I got frustrated and gave up.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have found A Song of Ice and Fire to be the very best series I have ever read! These books get better and better and this, the third in the series, is amazing! I love reading on my iPad especially knowing that when I reach the last page of this incredible book it's only a matter of a click on Amazon, a few seconds and I'll have the next book at my fingertips! Seamless reading for an epic series, just fantastic!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the fact that I can now have a nice big calculator on my kindle.  It comes in handy when you are trying to figure out how many beats per minute your heart should be doing when exercising.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Gravitating toward King's lighter side, I enjoyed the novel.  I was sad as I neared the end of the book because I didn't want it to end.  This novel is more like Hearts in Atlantis style than King's horror stuff.  I've only read the Bachman Books (short stories), the Stand, and Hearts in Atlantis.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is a great app to have because you can take it with you anywhere and do the exercises anytime.  I think that is a great thing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this app, really easy to use, buttons are big and is not complicated to use.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Accidentally came across these guys on SNL and I purchased the album right away. Great sound, big voice. AWESOME! Looking forward to more.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Love this book and the one before, can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. You won't be disappointed !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great way to solve problems and relax.  It requires more thinking than I originally thought it would.  I would highly recommend this app.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am an avid reader and I truly love this book, kept me really engaged! The John Corey books are all five stars, very entertaining, they are all must reads!
B008476HBM|5.0|I can't imagine ever reading another novel with as much dept .Miss Jane, I tip my hat to you!!!  The ultimate book
0767834739|2.0|Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series.  Simple as that.  Why?  Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick, and a rather average one at that.<br /><br />They bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.<br /><br />I'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight.  Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger.  Meh, Jill deserves better in my opinion.  Also, it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense, it's just that it's hard to believe (without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end.  Not a good storyline direction for a movie.<br /><br />There's nothing remotely scary about this movie.  Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans, that's for sure.  All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead.  I say avoid this movie and stick with the gaming series.
B002RI9HT8|3.0|Beautiful use of language does not conmpensate sufficiently for content. Well written but too depressing. I got past half way but didn't bother to finish it. Maybe you would enjoy it if you find great character studies fascinating - the intention might have been to be sadly funny.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|The movie was entertaining though I thought there was more they could have done with the Tommy Lee Jones Character. Makes me want to read the Book series.
B003Q6CUAI|4.0|The book explains the diet in detail. Although there is a lot of repitition, it is an easy and interesting read.<br />If you are following the Dukan diet, you need this book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|most awesome game ive ever played and its just a little hard to me but other than that great game
B009FZHYKU|2.0|For the first time in a long time, saw and episode that I regretted paying for.  And that is a bad thing.  I gonna stick with this series for a while, but it's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.<br /><br />The brilliance of this show is its ability to address &#34;virtue&#34; on a very physical level.  I think they have of lost their way in this manner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is great for comparing different versions of the Bible. I have been using this app since my first Apple product - the original iPad and it has worked flawlessly.  My favorite updates include parallel versions, updates and adding new versions frequently, new languages and ALL for FREE!!! I use the daily reading plans consistently and have read through the Bible 4 times since I began using the app. It makes it SO easy!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|sort of a Texas Blues sound from a Lady with a wailin guitar and a tight band. Reminds me of Janis Joplin with Big Brother & the Holding Company, Angela Strehli, and sometimes Bonnie Rait.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I'm not sure what I missed, but when I viewed this movie on my iPAD, nothing was displayed and nothing prompting me about having to pay for this movie.<br /><br />Can someone point out to me what I may have missed? If I would have seen or if I would have been prompted, I would NOT have ordered this movie at price $5.99.<br /><br />If I did not miss anything in the process of viewing this movie - I will likely dispute this charge with my credit card company.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim<br />252-330-2746
B007W7P5L8|5.0|It protects the Kindle nicely and I really like how it can be used to angle the display for video viewing.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|My grandchildren loved the gift of the complete collection of films. They enjoyed the Harry Potter series and watch them over and over!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|was an ok movie. wasnt the best of the series. did have some decent  action scences. it is part of the series that is why i watched it. it was free also
B000WN60NG|5.0|Outstanding movie I seen it before and loved it then. Good over evil and an outstanding cast. I  love Ralph Macchio and watch all his movies.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Good movie, brought another era to my attention and what the want of something can make men so evil. Ioved Shia Labeouf and all the other actors in this movie.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|i enjoyed this movie. thought it had a good story line. you think he is a sientist but wait. there is a twist.a good twist.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|I have never seen a Bourne movie I didn&#34;t like. Was a little scared this one would not live up to the other ones, but Jeremey Renner pulled it off.

B001IFZL50|4.0|I gave it four stars because I think it's too short of a series. I can understand these guys because I served in the same time at their age, but I will never know the experiences that they've gone through. It shows how the chain of command in the military can be full of people who aren't fit for their rank. This is a problem in the military, positions are filled by people who shouldn't be in charge, and making bad mistakes. But Marines will adapt and overcome as shown. The blue ray quality is good along with the sound. I haven't read the book to compare it to series.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|I already liked the music from having seen the film. I was impressed with the speed of delivery and indeed I thought the price was ok also.<br />I love the convenience of Amazon for books and music.<br />Gerry Smyth
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first Reacher book and I loved it. Action packed, the characters and detail were great and the plot kept me guessing the whole way through. Definitely reading the next one.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|We are amateurs and have found that this flash really makes a big difference in our photos.  Would recommend to others.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Lots of action plus the Pendergast we all love!  Opens the door for many  more plot lines.  Waiting for the next one.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It was a good read and kept me interested but some of the story became implausable near the end. I like his books but not this as much--
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show simply because it allows you to capture the fantasy of what it could be like to live or try to survive in a post apocalyptic zombie world!
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I purchased this product because the audio output on my computer is not enough to power my headphones. But it only needed a slight boost, so I went with one of the lower end amplifiers, instead of a more expensive one.<br /><br />Having used it for a couple of days, I really like it. It does a good job of boosting the volume without distorting the music.<br /><br />I do have two complaints though:<br />-The bass-boost button doesn't work particularly well.<br />-It takes quite a few clicks to noticeably change the volume.<br /><br />Overall a good product
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have yet to get stuck on a board, which makes it not as challenging but it is fun overall.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Can't wait to read Beautiful Chaos and Beautiful Redemption! This story was so good and I loved the plot and new characters. I just saw Beautiful Creatures at the movies!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a really good with describing the characters and how my mind turns on and starts to imagine what he is writing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's good I like the previous books so I wanted to read this one as well. So I will read it
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I saw this app advertised as the &#34;free android app of the day&#34;.<br /><br />I downloaded the app to my Samsung Galaxy TAB 10.1 and found the game to be very enjoyable.<br /><br />The black and white &#34;light&#34; color works well for the games theme (A fish deep under water). The game utilizes familiar features found in well-known apps (ex: angry birds) such as the 3 star rating system.<br /><br />The sound effects and background music are pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />I needed to raise the volume on my TAB about halfway before I began hearing the sounds.<br /><br />I played 5 levels before stopping. The game is simple to play while providing a slight increase in the challenge after each level<br /><br />The game has goals/achievements that may provide replay value for some players.<br /><br />I don't see myself playing this app everyday, but I do see it keeping my interest overtime.<br /><br />Overall, I found this app to be well balanced- simple and fun.
B003TXKSWK|3.0|i love john legend so i support what this is. but when you compare it to his other cds, its a different feel. its not like i dont like the cd, its more like a cd album the requires a certain taste for music. there are songs on here i love (like shine) and others i skip over (like humanity)
B004GHNIRK|4.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book and catch the missing details.  Found it very interesting and informative, but Hugo kind of went overboard in digressions--some took chapters to  expound on, and I got a little bored at times with this device.  But  it was still a great book, and a good read.  He was superb in making the characters come to life.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Awesome movie from start to finish!  A must have have for your movie collection!  We enjoy this movie every time we watch it which usually happens about once a month!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Great actress, lousy movie. Maybe I should not be so harsh in judging so called horrow flicks, it's just that I've seen much better.
B0086700CM|5.0|My 8 year old daughter loves it...and her score improves daily ! Screen graphics are realistic, fun, bright, and entertaining !
B002VECM6S|5.0|Non fiction, good story,great actors.After seeing movie I was interested in reading about the family that opened their home and hearts to someone out of their comfort zone.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Hooked me in to this fun & captivating & straight forward game...my daughter & I love to play it together !
B004EPZ06G|4.0|Fun movie with little known actors. It will probably make you curious enough to want to see Hangover part 1.
0920236162|1.0|Really a terrible book. The authors are trying to teach a good principal but go about it in the wrong way. A princess goes to rescue a prince (shouldn't it be other way around) and after all her heroics she ends up calling him a bum and the book ends, This is by far the lamest children's book I have ever seen, not suitable for any age.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great story. Academy award material. Glad I purchased it. Would highly recommend viewing if you are a movie buff like me..
B0083GR6Y6|1.0|Do not waste your money, this film is truly horrible, there is no redeeming factor to it at all, just a horrid, hopeless film with a terrible story and zero purpose.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Unusual plot for a western,but interesting. No stage coaches,bank robberies,indian fights,saloon brawls,long cattle and trail rides or hero saving herroin.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the layout and how detailed is the information presented. So far, it never crashed as it happens a lot with other weather apps from my experience.Great app!
1616550414|5.0|The best quality book you could want, filled with the best quality Art and Lore.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying it, stop thinking and buy it!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very interesting how the turn of events keep you guessing. Things are not<br />what they seem. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a mystery or someone<br />trying to figure out their family's history. It makes you think about the stories that are attached to a picture!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|From page one to the end I was captivated. I haven't read a book that held my full attention for a long time. I love the blend of old lore with modern time's.  You don't have to be a nerd to enjoy this just someone who enjoys a good story with time to let your imagination fill in the rest.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|I loved the movie and although it was sad, it had a happy ending.. It's a shame the younger generation will not relate to the original black & white classic horror films that this movie was based on. Tim Burton is the best
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed the book because it provides information about what the Seals have to go through to become Seals. The story was intriguing. The book gave me a greater appreciation of our military and the sacrifices they make to keep us safe.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My Husband and I could not stop laughing, Adam Sandler's voice was the best.. We loved the story and it's great for adults and kids..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun little game that builds as you good. I love it. I miss having horses and although it is just a game it reminds me of horse filled days.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a great read for book lovers! Who doesn't like a good mystery that starts in a book store? This book held no true surprises, yet I loved it. I think it is because sometimes you just want to read - and enjoy - a good story. This is that story. Everytime I thought maybe something was too obvious, I changed my mind because this is the story I wanted it to be. I can only assume it was written by someone who loves books - and understands how to write a nice, uncomplicated, and throughly enjoyable story. The tone of the main character was almost humorous - in a good way. He made me nervous as he didn't keep secrets too well; but, that made me realize how nice this story was. I cared about the main character as well as all the other supporting characters. What more can you ask for in a good read?
B006P96PAO|5.0|The life of four men changed went they gave God the control of their life and families. There were several situation of how we are so blessed in our lives when allow God to take over!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it one of the best books read in a long time. I would highly recommend reading this book today.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's probably as close to Super Mario Bros. on the Kindle Fire as you will ever get. I love it! You should check out the first game, too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like solitaire enjoy playing it . Its a good game to play whan your on a plane or car.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awsome game great for kids and should be on every smart phone everyone should play it. very fun and recomended
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This was an excellent show. Would recommend it to all. Had you wanting to watch  the whole series at one sitting. Can't wait to buy season three. I know  its on televsion right now. I would like to have the series to watch it again and have my children and grandchildren watch it. This is a classic  and very well done.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love Lindsey!  She is amazing and talented.  Music is beautiful.  Be sure to check her out on youtube my favorite song is spontaneous me. LOVE HER!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoyed playing it. This was the first time i have played Mahjong.Would recommand it to anyone. Its a fun game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm shocked by the way this book was published. Collins did good. This was a great way to end the trilogy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its great to have. Comes in handy when your shopping, and then your in a resturaunt and wanting to firure out how much of a tip to leave.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|It looks decent and will work fine for a while. However, a little over a week afte I received it, it would no longer stand my kindle up. It also feels to be of very cheap quality.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It is completely and absolutely Tina Fey at he  best. She is honest about pretty much everything and its nice to hear someone's opinions that are similar to mine. This book will leave you wanting to be her best friend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Nothing is missing from Season 3, and there are some real surprises as well.  Great show as usual, with fine acting, scripting, and period sets.
0920236251|4.0|This is a great story for young kids.  It was one of my favorites to read to my kids when they were young, so I decided to buy a copy for a friend's kids.  I was surprised that the edition I received was a tiny little book (3&#34; x 3&#34; I think).  The book I remember from my kids' childhood was more of a standard size.  I almost felt silly giving away such a small copy of such a great book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is as intriguing, gutsy and tense for Daniel's Craig's performance as Bond.  It's the best of his trio of Bond outings to date and ultimately maybe the high bar by which his Bond is judged amongst his predecessors.  While one appreciates the reinvention of MI6 in Skyfall, one can't but help think Dame Judy Dench's performances these last 7 Bond films has pushed M from being a pencil pusher behind the desk to a field general marshaling her one man spy army to victory.  I can't wait to see the Bond 24!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written, I could not put it down!!  I enjoyed the various connections throughout the entire story.  I really liked this book.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The book is riveting. Holds your interest throughout. Keeps you guessing. Highly recommend all Lee Child's books. What's keeping you from reading it?
B00280LYIM|5.0|Another great book ready for the next one. Keep this excitement going and the the next book. The Last Olympian.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I've read quite a few Lincoln books as well as civil war books, but this one is hard to beat. The author really accomplishes her goal by putting Lincoln in context with his cabinet members and more. The best part is that I am 1/3 of the way through and have not yet found a section that bogs down and drags on and on. Each chapter is so interesting, so well written. She does a great job weaving others into the text without losing sight of Lincoln himself. I've also completed two of three of his triolgy civil war classic, and he too does a great job. However by comparison, details in a few places have bogged me down and I had to work my way through those details. Still, it too is a great read. But so far I am enjoying Team of Rivals ever more. Could be my interests & personality - whatever the reason - I highly recommend it.<br />All in all, context makes a delightful difference.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but the only bad thing is when you die you spawn at the end of the map
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|very good product. however, if you are not walking while using it and want something that is nearly as good, try the opteka x-grip: http://www.amazon.com/Opteka-Professional-Camcorder-Stabilizing-Handle/dp/B003PBB4ME
B0063IH60K|5.0|I totally enjoy solitaire, and this is such fun to play. I like the choices of what kind of deal you want to play.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|This review is about the Monster High Create a Monster Blob and Ice Set.  First off, Blob is really adorable, I love the magenta face coloring, has little sparkles in the plastic and absolutely love the wig.  It is a soft plastic, fits her face perfectly and just is the icing on the cake.  Her limbs are magenta see thru with sparkles.  Her hands have Laguna hands where the fingers are bent.  Ice has ice blue see through limbs with a pretty ice blue wig with magenta highlights.  These dolls are some of the cutest of the create a monster line.  Ice's hands are the straight open fingers.  Both have cute dresses, however I'd like to see them do a Create a Monster in pants instead of always dresses.  Sometime, o.k. most of the time the dresses are way too short.  I like to sit them sometimes and not see all their parts, if you know what I mean.  Issues.  Everything was good, however, when you place the lower arm on to the upper arm, bend the little rod first.  I didn't bend them at first and when I tried to bend her at the elbow, it was a little tight so I took if off and bent it and placed it in again.  Now it works better.  I just don't want you to have to force it from straight.  It was the same on both dolls but they work perfect now.  Another issue was the wig for ICE.  Her's was a slant bang cut which was pretty awful.  I straightened it a little myself with scissors. Now it's better.  They are a nice addition to the monster high collection and if you have a little girl who loves pink then Blob is for her.  Also to put Blob's wig on you have to bend her head a little, it's o.k., she's plyable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a very good book. A little repetitive in some places. But also very steamy, so it made up for that! =)
B004GFN11A|4.0|Wordpress itself is pretty amazing. It's robust widget and theme based software has revolutionized the layman's ability to create a site, manage it, and even update it almost effortlessly. Add to that a little app you can manage your site from on your phone and you're a juggernaut of web activity, all at the coffee house, local park or even on the toilet. Okay, maybe that was a bit too far but it is indeed a powerful little app. With it, you can create and edit posts and pages as well as embed pictures. You can even view stats and look at comments as well as reply to them. My only beef is that the stats take a long time to load but they're loading a lot of information so I really can't complain. There's actually more information on the app view of the stats than on the desktop view! One thing I do not like is the individual posts interface as it's more like viewing the Code view instead of the Visual view on the Desktop Dashboard. Still, it's an amazing app that literally puts your website's management in the palm of your hand. What's not to like? :-)
B008133MDK|5.0|I loathe most American detective dramas. There endings are always telegraphed and simplistic. Sex and violence are not merely added incentives, but rather driving forces in the &#34;CSIs&#34; and &#34;Law and Orders.&#34; I enjoy mysteries where the main protagonist is far smarter than I will ever be. I like to be impressed by the intelligence of the writers and the characters. The American retailing of Sherlock Holmes, &#34;Elementary,&#34; is a good show. I particularly like the reinvisioning of the Dr. Watson role to a smarter, more integral role. However, it still falls prey to the pitfalls of other American mystery shows.<br /><br />&#34;Sherlock&#34; however, is a sheer delight. It is excellently told with wonderfully caste actors. I have developed a bit of a man-crush on Benedict Cumberbatch. I am looking forward to his role as the villain in the new &#34;Star Trek.&#34; I cannot recommend this series enough. It is intelligent,  exciting, and well acted. More importantly, this show uses the original Holmes stories as templates for its scripts. Because of this show and &#34;Elementary&#34; I have decided it is finally time to read some of the &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; classics I have always ignored. Watch just the first episode and you will be hooked.<br /><br />Ward of warning though. Each episode is basically a movie about and hour and a half long. Give yourself the time to watch them the whole way through.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My friend and I downloaded this game, and it is extremely fun. However,  My friend and I both had to delete and redownload it multiple times, until it wouldn't download anymore because of REPEATED CRASHING!!! I wish I could play this game again. Please fix it Imangi Studios!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Discovered Special Agent Pendergast by accident. He is addictive!  Can't wait to start the next novel!  Wonder what adventures we will share.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Wonderful, entertaining little movie with two of my favorite actors. Humorous and witty. Seeing Steve Carrell as marriage councelor was a real hoot!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm is very easy to use and the functions are veried enough tjat it can be set for even  the hardest to wake.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Nice straightforward story. Guy gets girl, and she is a strong, smart woman! Love that.....Very real believeable characters, well casted production
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This is without discussion the best movie ever made and Boogie and Bergman continue to amaze because of their talent and unique film persona!!!
B0091XRL86|4.0|Cute and funny children's flick, with a few laughs for the parents- Good. Kids love stories about pirates, especially when they are witty as this one is. Good casting for the voice-over too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Quick , easy, and fast opening app with all the option of the pc online version.  Great to have access to when I need to travel
B007R12TNQ|4.0|Clever adaptation of the albums and books from my childhood. Jason Lee is perfect in this role as he is as hugably cute as the chipmunks themselves. Musical numbers were suprisingly well done. Pure entertainment.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I love the idea of watching one whole season at a time.  I am hooked on watching all serial shows this way.  This one held my interest.
B0073PPNE8|4.0|One of my favorite productions depicting strong dedicated gals. Beautiful story. True love on many levels. Well casted, superb acting, very real.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|What can I say...if you like his music, you'll love this album.  I'm just into this kind of music and he is the master
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|There's a lot of blood in this movie mixed in with great slow-motion special effects. A bit cheesy but overall fun to watch. We never see Dredd's face which is more in line with the Dredd comics, from what I've read.
B008D30K7E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is different-an unlikely and pacy romp through the eyes of a 100 year old man-with a potted history of the century thrown in. It is uplifting and a page turner with a motley band of eclectic friends..the plot is impossible to retell-so random and scattered are its parts. Yet it works! The title alone made me want to read it.<br />I would have given it a 5th star but I felt it could have been shorter. Maybe one less world leader..<br />would definitely recommend it .
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Great movie, great acting, awesome songs, this cult classic is a movie that lives up to it's reputation!  Tim Curry is and always will be the man!  Or woman... Or.. just.. A SWEET TRANSVESTITE FROM TRANSEXUAL TRANSYLVANIA!
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I'm a big fan of well-made martial arts movies and seeing this movie had Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe made me give this a go. What a mistake.  RZA should stick to music producing and leave directing and acting alone.  Quentin Tarantino lent his name when asked I suppose, to draw his fans, but this garbage has nothing remotely close to Tarantino's directing or writing.<br /><br />Embarrassing bad. I should have gotten a clue when RZA's character appears with a contemporary haircut and NY accent.  And the rap music that accompanied every (badly choreographed) fight scene.<br /><br />Rented this last night and wish I could get my $4 and 107 minutes back.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Picks right up from first book<br />Still raw erotic sex, with 'real' emotion/love peeking through<br />Internal childhood secrets start to come into play<br />characters deepen<br />Readers desire more. Book 3<br />A SUPER READ
B000FCK65W|4.0|Very good book, but is a slow read.  It brought up a lot of memories that were good and bad.
0307586901|4.0|I love Martha Stewart publications (books and magazines) for their always beautiful photographs. Most of the fun I receive from these products are sitting down and thumbing through the pages just to look at the pictures.<br /><br />This book is no different.<br /><br />It is full of ideas for crafts for New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hannukah, and Christmas. The level of difficulty varies. There are ideas for decorations, party decor, gift wrapping, small handmade gifts, projects appropriate for kids, and more. Many of the ideas can be done just a little bit differently for different occasions (for example, we are not Jewish, but many of the ideas in the Hannukah section can be tweaked to use in other contexts)<br /><br />No, the patterns aren't within the book, but I actually prefer having them as files on the computer. I simply went to the website, downloaded the patterns, and saved them in a file on my computer. It didn't take very long to download all of them, and now they are ready for me to print when I need them. Easy peasy.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|You cannot get this to work without goiing thru many steps that include signing up for a google account, which still does not work.  Big waste of money to suck me into a bunch of crap.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got this on my tablet. its easy and fun. my husband plays it more than I do. Works Great! We enjoy it
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was amazing I choose a five star rating because I really enjoyed it I wish it didn't have to end
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|i wanted a good series to enjoy for a while, and this one has offered that.  In the genre it's in, there is of course the high emotion and drama of being a teen, and there is a lot of dashing around, danger and a constant amount of conversations interrupted to the point it's almost funny... but it works with the plot and the world created. i hope they don't ruin the story with the movie.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I was excited about this movie. Then I pushed play. I was not impressed, but I also am not the biggest martial arts movie fan. This just didn't entertain me.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie. I was very pleased with the quality of this film. And I am so happy that I was able to order it from Amazon even though this film has went back into the vault. Thank you!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it! I never get bored of it. Its like temple run, sorta,for those who like temple run...will like this game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Intriguing and captivating from beginning to end. My favorite from the 50 Shades trilogy. I would definitely recommend to all my friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book for a couple different reasons. First, was the pacing. As with all great books, there must be a pace that keeps one interested in the book. If it lulls for to long, you lose interested, if it's to hectic you lose focus. Next, the characters. Ender is a little boy, whom anyone should be able to find commonalities with. Scared, unsure, insecure, angry, alone, these are all feelings he felt, and could easily be identified with. Also, Fantasy. This book takes place in the future, and therefore contains unheard of technologies, new worlds, and mysterious aliens. All of which inspire great imagination, and excitement. All in all I would say this is a pretty great book!
B000I55YV2|5.0|This is one of the best movies, especially for its clever and unique methods of stealing and the revenge the gang took!  Great fun and promotion of the Mini-Coopers in their escapade!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Hard to get past the beginning but after you won't regret reading it. Pulls you and you can't let go.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I love the series, and wish I could get the rest of the earlier seasons on blu ray. So far, none are available in blu ray as far as I can see.
B000002J29|3.0|Wonderful performance and very moody and beautiful music.  I agree this does capture the band at a magical period in their career (just prior to Steve Hackett leaving), but the probelm is Phil's vocals are so low in the mix, without a lyric sheet in front of me, I have a hard time understanding him.  Also, he did not talk to the crowd much in between songs did he?
B005M2A4DE|5.0|I love the series, and wish I could get the rest of the earlier seasons on blu ray. So far, none are available in blu ray as far as I can see.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Super jeu pour les enfants! Graphisme excellent et facile à comprendre :)<br />Je le conseille vivement même aux plus grands
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked up the book after watching the movie, not disappointed at all. Great story can't wait to start reading book two, I will  definitely recommend it and make all of my friends read it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is easily the best Nicholas Sparks book I've read to date! I had to read the book befor I could watch the movie & I couldn't wait the 2 weeks to watch the movie after I finished the book. IMO this book even beats The Notebook. =)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This WOULD be a great game with very nice graphics, but there are way too many freezes. Of course these freezes happen just as you snagged a bingo or something lesser.  And they don't refund your credits. I've already gone through a bunch of coins but now I am enjoying another bingo game which seems a little fairer.  It really would be fun - maybe you want to try it and see for yourself.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after 50 Shades, and I loved it. The writing is a little more polished than 50, story lines are similar, and I enjoyed it very much. Recommended highly.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I downloaded this game for my grandsons to play.  They love it!  I'm not as likely to play on my pad as they are.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|One can discern a great “truth is stranger than fiction” storyline by asking the following question:  if the story were initially presented as fiction, would it be plausible as truth?  If the answer is “no”, and the story really is true, then reality has indeed trumped fiction.  That is certainly the case with “Searching for Sugar Man” (SSM):  the storyline appears too good to be true – but it is.  It is not only a great storyline, but an enlightening portrait of a charismatic, enigmatic man and several important historical eras.  By telling the story of Rodriguez, the filmmakers hold a mirror to two separate-but-linked societies and tell us much about ourselves.<br /><br />At the center of SSM is, of course, Rodriguez and his music.  If forced to describe him in three words or less, I think “Detroit’s Bob Dylan” are as good as any others.  Like Dylan, his songs are poems put to music, with each word and phrase carrying much meaning, creating a strong emotional impact on the listener.  I’ve actually never much cared for Dylan’s music, as his time and era do not match mine, and I can’t stand Dylan’s singing voice.  By contrast I actually enjoyed Rodriguez’s music and his singing – SSM contains at least portions of most of the songs on his two albums.  As Rodriguez hails from Detroit, from very different economic circumstances than the college-educated middle class Robert Zimmerman, his songs are grittier, edgier, and more fatalistic.  Perhaps that is why they didn’t appeal to the masses in the U.S., but did so in South Africa.<br /><br />Or maybe it was a case of Dylan having a more appealing persona and appearance.  As I learned when visiting Memphis and the old Sun Record studios, Elvis was far from the only person in Memphis at the time playing that type of rock-and-roll music.  But he had it all: the music, the voice, the stage presence and the good looks, and he is the one who rocketed to superstardom, while others achieved onlyminor success or remained in obscurity.  Something similar may have happened with Rodriguez in the U.S.<br /><br />The process by which Rodriguez’s music became popular in South Africa is startling, and is only possible because it was, at the time, a closed society.  One mystery that SSM cannot quite solve is what happened to all the royalty money, although the interview with Clarence Avant provides the strongest clue.  But money aside, the stories Rodriguez’s fans tell about the impact his music had on their lives are heartwarming.  The ending of the movie couldn’t have been better scripted if it had been written by Hollywood’s best – and yet it wasn’t.  I highly recommend “Searching for Sugar Man” – it is almost too good to be true.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My favorite Nicholas Sparks book so far and I've read them all. It was a surprise ending.  I really enjoyed it.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I wish I'd had the courage to undertake something like this when I was his age.<br />Great movie. Great insight into a young man's mind in regards to how happiness can be achieved without all of the bells and whistles we seek after everyday. This movie shows that Love and companionship is the base for all happiness.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is just getting better!  Be prepared to laugh, to cry, to hate and to love!  Such a wonderful show!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The grandkids love the movie as do we.  Can watch it over and over again.  Good addition to our collection.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|A little slow moving at times, but overall good movie.  I would recommend you view it.  Overall a 3.5 - 4 star movie.
1577314808|3.0|The book was ok for the reason it was written.  A lot of it I couldn't seem to  understand but not bad.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This is an older movie that for some reason I never had a chance to watch.  Viewed it on my amazon prime membership, and I'm glad I watch.  Great movie.  A little predictable but still a great view.
B000002PB2|5.0|I've always liked this album and it arrived in perfect shape and went into Itunes without a glitch on my computer!
1433502410|5.0|I purchased this Bible upon recommendation from our church.  Everybody needs a good study Bible & this one adds so much to your study experience.  Each book has an Introduction & each page has footnotes that guide you through the Scriptures.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I am an avid reader and always finish a book  BUT this book is very hard to finish as it is extremely boring.  I have read many books on the NDE and find the author had good intentions of explaining his experience but I think he brings his medical knowledge in depth to much into the book.  If you're a neurosurgeon than I recommend this book.  If not,  you may want to skip it.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I thought this might hold up to putting some serious music, almost 200 cassettes onto an external hard drive but the tape deck didn't last for three tapes.  The software is free on line so look else where for a good deck.
B0035YTG30|5.0|I love Audrey Hepburn and this is one of my favorites! It has great acting and is girly and humorous.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Each season of this show keeps getting better and better.  The writing and character development in amazing.  I was able to enjoy seasons 1-4 via amazon prime.  I only wish season 5 was included.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey does a great job of following many characters and story lines. It's like a soap opera without all the awkward long pauses and drawn out scenes. I've found myself emotionally invested in the characters, crying when something bad happens, feeling excited when good things happen. All 3 seasons have been fantastic!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I was surprised when I learned that I would have to purchase a camera app for the Kindle HD which comes with a camera built in.  I suppose the app works fine, but I don't have much use for it anyway.  Its a bit awkward to take photos with a big Kindle HD.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I Loved it,  I watched season 1 & 2.  Can't wait for season 3. Best series i have seen in a long time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book keeps you on edge and you can relate to the main character easily. The ending is the best!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super fun if your a horse lover than this is the game for you and it's for boys to.
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you are reading this review then you have likely already seen season 1 and 2.  If not and are looking to jump ahead... DON'T...go back and watch from the beginning.  Amazon as always does a great job with their online streaming, and this one is no different.
0307346617|5.0|This was an incredible and immersive read. I could not put it down! The writing is such that you certainly feel as though you are reading a historical account and not a work of fiction (yes I know this is the point but Brooks takes care to ensure that at no point do you ever remember that these things didn't actually happen) I certainly felt everything was genuinely a part of our past.<br /><br />Second, I loved all of the social commentary he was making through the dialogue. Very similar in my opinion to the way A Brave New World by Huxley was commenting on societal issues, I felt that Brooks was through his book relaying some of his opinions on the world and cultures and societies and the way that we interact.<br /><br />Great read, a must have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great!!! It's fun and entertaining. I enjoy playing it as well as my niece. Keep the game ad free.
B000000W94|5.0|go away will you this is good can be happy er not much more to say buy it are youll be sorry
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Bill Murray is often described as one of America's funniest men, and this movie proves it. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, prepare yourself to laugh... over and over again... and again...
B0039TAHMA|5.0|We loved every one of these in the trilogy. Cannot wait to own it. A family favorite for sure! We have watched these over and over again and they never get old.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|If you love comedy, heart, story, and brilliant acting then look no further than Disney's The Muppet Christmas Carol. This movie has been entertaining our family for years and should be a staple of every home.
B007EECSFA|4.0|i love this author and have read all her books.....while this was not my favorite of all her books I still enjoyed it very much--it's the story of a close family (all girls and one boy who is the baby)  where the oldest child witness's a murder while in her early teens and the secret she keeps-the story holds other secrets through out the book.  The story flashes back from War time (WW2) in Europe to present time detailing the mother's past life and the older daughters quest to discover her mothers past life ....something her mother never shared with her children.  I don't like to give much about a story when I review as it leaves no surprises.  It's a good read-wordy at times but that's my only complailnt.
B001B6M0F0|5.0|One of the very best live albums of all time! I learned the lead guitar on this record when I 1st started performing, and many of the songs made our set list. Was awesome re learning the songs this past week, brings back some great memories.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I chose it because I had seen 2 seasons and wanted this for my library.  Loved by many and anxious to see season 4 to see what happens next.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I loved the first season but have not recevied the second season so I have no idea what it will be like
B00012L786|5.0|A+ for this movie...I watch it over and over...too bad Jean Peters quit the business later...but kudos to her for being choosy.....Richard Widmark excels again...DVD in good condition
B006LSZECO|3.0|I wanted to read a new author and chose a best seller one.  I liked the book but sometimes it was slow moving.  Some authors get carried away with description and I dont care about the wind in the trees or the waves of the water just tell the story.  I felt it took too long to set it up.  When I was finished I still felt too much stuff that was not necessary to write.  Maybe I am too picky but it just seemed to drag in spots.
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|Early and believable space exploration/colonization at its finest. A great story is the gravy. Reynolds can construct a galaxy like no other.
0345803485|5.0|Awesome book, definetly worth reading and buying the trilogy. Really, really, good, specially the first book out of the three!
1419705849|5.0|Book was sent promptly even though it was the busy order season--Christmas. Our grandson loves this book, it 's a great read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the typical abused wife story with a happy ending.  It is sad and emotional, a little heavey because it concerns such a serious issue.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the book as escape reading.  I didn't want the hero to be a crook, although it was pretty amazing how everything worked out.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|A great read, insightful and laugh out loud. Perfect for women who wonder what being a woman is all about.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|It was a very interesting story with insight into North Korea, but I personally found the subject matter harsh, sometimes confusing, and a real downer.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Well written.<br />It keeps the reader's interest all along its many pages. (As if it were a mistery novel.)<br />It allows to understand China's present situation within the frame of its particular history.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|This game is pretty fun.  To the guy who rated it low because its too hard, delete your real life character please
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|This is a great show! Capt. Jack is awesome! Definitely a must see who love sci-fi and adventure. You get hooked from the first show.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It got old and dragged towards the middle but it had a great ending!<br /><br />Still a pretty good reading material.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great story and reading it on my new mini Ipad made it even better. i am ready a book a week.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I just love these games. Cooking dash is just sooooo much fun to play. I could play it all day long. Just wish they had more levels. Awesome Game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give this book a 5-star because of how it was written: sexy, erotic, sad a lot of emotions throughout this fascinating novel..very interesting. I loved how Ana and Christian were starting to have \\"more\\" but what i didn't like was that Ana was blowing off his warnings and it was her fault that she blew off the chance to reconcile the hurt, violence from Christian's heart and past because she insisted for him to show her how the punishments can hurt. But i still loved this novel. I give it two thumbs-up!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A lot depends on what you like.<br /><br />If you are a Denzel fan, and I am, then this is a solid movie with a very interesting first 25 minutes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that spends most of the time in the air, on a plane, then this isnt that movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a very flawed pilot who makes a remarkable landing and saves a lot of lives, but is himself a drunk and drug addict.<br /><br />I think it does an interesting job of showing how people are complicated.<br /><br />It is not a perfect movie by any means, but Denzel is always interesting to me.<br />John Goodman steals the scenes he is in, and I wish there were more of him in the movie.<br />If nudity and coarse language bother you a lot, stay away.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Ahh can't wait to start the next book! There's always so many questions but just enough answers to keep me so intrigued!
B0090O07S2|5.0|I have watched other Doors videos and none are as good of quality as this one is.  I would highly recommend getting this for any Doors fan!
1616550414|5.0|If you like/love the Legend of Zelda series, and have enough money for this, GET IT!<br />If you like/love the Legend of Zelda series, and don't have enough money for it, SAVE UP!<br />This book has the timeline, concept art, info, a 30+ page comic, and MORE!<br />This is a really awesome book.<br />(If you don't like the Legend of Zelda series, you've got a problem)
B006P0FICE|5.0|Good clean action adventure.  Great acting, great video, great cgi that blended the real scene with cgi, great colors, great image detail, great good vs. evil theme, great resident evil thing, great evil guy and his henchman and audio was great.  Wardrobe was unbelieveablely excellent.  I for one would like to see a trilogy.  All in all, very entertaining.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Amazing!!!!! This book touched my heart as I have 2 daughters that have tried to commit suicide . I strongly recommend this book.
1400067820|5.0|I think this book is very well written and it was easy to read and understand.  I recommend to those who are interested in this author.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|its great u should by it. its action backed with levels of pure fun. love love it love it .
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This movie is loaded with thrilling action and Daniel Craig is one hot actor as well. I love it and I would reccomend this movie. It is worth the purchase.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Pretty good book for the price.  Fast and east to read on my android.  Would recommend as an easy read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really enjoy this app.  I let it play all night, falling asleep to a peaceful sound.  My favorites are waves and rain.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun for kids. simple yet entertaining on trips. Daughter loves it and we trade turns playing for fun. good bonding time.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is a unqiue and interesting story - early in the story, I wondered where it was headed and why.  As I read on, I became more and more curious about how it would end.  The author takes an unusual topic and weaves a great tale.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|G5 games are some of my favorite adventure games available.  Works great on my Kindle Fire HD....not buggy at all...and with quality graphics and a pinch zoom interface for the hidden object puzzles.  They say I can get the sequel if I reviewed, but if they don't deliver I will edit my review to let you know.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Fun short stories and by a master . . always have been a Michael Connelly fan and probably always will be as long as he continues to write good stories.  As I've repeated - too much time has elapsed since I read this group of short stories but I know I enjoyed them.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I was already familiar with the general arc of Jobs' life, but this book was still very engaging and provided several first-person perspectives on the private moments of a very complex man. The examples (positive and negative) of how Jobs conducted his career and family life make for a great story, and even if you aren't a fan you can appreciate how his passion & ego changed the world.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Touching! For the author to describe the emotions that parents would have felt in such circumstances. I have thought about it for many days....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good graphics and offers harder challenges. It was a bit hard to get used to, but once I finally got used to it, the game turned out to be really good
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app works as advertised. I like that multiple locations are stored and easily accessed. Static radar images are useful.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I gave this to someone else but it was well received and I think everyone has seen most (if not all of )The Godfather movies so I can't imagine it would not be great if you like this genre.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|...I resolved to read this book after seeing the movie. My logic being if the movie was good, the book had to be better. I was right.<br /><br />The first part of the book was a little \\"basebally\\" for me but I was glad I read on. Lewis' style made for an entertaining read that was hard to put down and the insight he provided into the monolithic institution of baseball was invaluable.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Back in 2011, when I was finally ready to replace my regular watch with a GPS enabled running watch, I asked friends what they would recommend - some said Nike, some Garmin. I leaned towards Garmin due to the fact that the 405 CX has way more control options. As it turned out the watch was a little bit overkill - I never used a lot of the features.<br /><br />I won't hold that against the Garmin 405 CX. But why the bad review?<br /><br />Because I had to replace my watch three months after the original purchase because of a defective battery. And now, 18 months after I received the replacement, the battery is so bad, that the watch is dead after a couple of short runs and a few days without usage.<br /><br />That would be a chance for Garmin's support to shine. Instead they insist that I pay almost $90 (40 % of the purchase price) for another replacement watch, a Garmin 410. And you are not able to replace the battery yourself. This feels like a watch that keeps on costing a lot, and I feel ripped off.<br /><br />Time to look for an alternative.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I read Les Mis some many years ago and re-read it just before seeing the movie recently. Urrrgh is all I can say. I admire Hugo's intelligence and knowledge of minutae and esoteric knowledge (like the history of the sewer system in Paris) but the style of writing and the hubris which he extends over these topics (including a yawning account of the Battle of Waterloo, inserted in the middle of the novel) makes me wonder who his editor was or if h had one. I know years ago I must have read an abridged edition, which removed all the extemporaneous essays which dilute the plot (tthe aforementioned, plus one about the practices of an extreme cloistered sect) and made the book a better read.  If you want the story itself without all the interruptions, find an abridged edition. The book is way to long in its original form and gets very boring!!! I still cried at the end because the story itself is very good. If the book had been written today it would have been edited to half its size.
B005721W9O|5.0|Loved it!!  Found it funny and entertaining...would suggest it to any, Tim Allen, fan.. Cast worked very well together..Awesome job!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Another really good movie from Denzel & Zemeckis. First half of movie grabs your attention and keeps it. A little soft after that, and a really great last twenty mins . Well worth the price to rent. Denzel still has it !!
B007WKEM8C|5.0|GREAT COOK BOOK and fun to read! I have not yet made any thing from this book but my daughter has and so far its been great stuff. The cheese crackers and the Crispy treats were great! I plan trying it out this weekend especially the breakfast recipes.
141659521X|5.0|This is an excellent addition to Flynn's Mitch Rapp series. If you are considering this book, I would humbly suggest you read the books in the order they were published. The series starts with Mr. Rapp already a seasoned veteran of black ops, and then traces his career by moving both forward and backward.<br /><br />Mr. Flynn has shown himself to be adept at placing Mr. Rapp in several genres, from straight up warfighter/terrorist hunter to an almost Ludlum-esque practitioner of espionage trade craft. Flynn has shown himself to be a true plotmaster, seemlessly and happily throwing Rapp into different challenges. After a couple of books that leaned toward the espionage end of the spectrum, this entry in the series places Rapp back in the thick of the fight in Afghanistan in the (basically) current day. Rapp's usual posse, including CIA Director Kennedy, former SEAL Scott what's his name, and others come along for the ride.<br /><br />Pure escapist fun, this is a briskly paced adventure that does not disappoint.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|If you enjoy time piece series you won't be disappointed.  Violence, sex, deceit, (no Bada-Bing) - it's the early Church version of the &#34;Sopranos&#34;, only with collars!
B009CF7GRY|2.0|Not the best remake I've seen. Acting was substandard. Main actor was not the best, Ann's Dennis Quade has been better.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Once again Horsham doesn't disappoint.  Although different than his usual it was most definitely a page turner.  I recommend this book as a good read
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|My usual genre is detective murder mysteries. I picked up this book as a change of pace. I took a chance. I got it on a discount offer, so I didn't expect much: If I didn't like it, I could toss it and wouldn't be out the full price of a book. Instead, I enjoyed a delightful read with well-developed and &#34;real&#34; characters who caught my interest and attention. I cared about what happened to them and wondered how each event would turn out. I liked the weaving of past and present, learning just enough about the past to apply it to the present. All-in-all, a great read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A nail-biter that seemed like an implausable plot until the story began to unfold.  The ending left me sad and a bit an.gry with the protagonist
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Fun popcorn movie. Russell Crowe is always good, and Lucy Lu gives a nice performance.<br />The choreography while overdone is fun too.
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|I found reading this book to be a chore. I am not one to stop mid book so it took me over 8 weeks to read. I wanted to like it but it was so slow
B00899F0G8|5.0|truly enjoy this show ~ recently been ill and I rewatched all the episodes and it has given me something to do and look forward to watching in my recovery~
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've had this product just a few months. I love this tool because it is so user friendly and it does everything I need.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Fast paced with a flawed lead character always makes a good read<br />Good story line of a small town with hidden secrets
B007B6VOG0|4.0|The album is good, the first 5 songs are my favorite, and I think they are the best. The second half are good, but not so much as the first half.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I cannot remember why I decided to add The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology that Fuel Success and Performance at Work. to my Kindle. It sat unread for months. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I was intrigued by the way Shawn presented key psychological theories in an easy to read format. While the heavy emphasis on business applications and life at Harvard were not of direct interest, I could apply what he was saying to my general life.<br /><br />After reading the book, I understand why people struggle to perform at their optimal level when they do not harbor a positive attitude. While the ability to retrain a negative or positive brain is possible, it requires dedication to the process of adjusting one's mindset. Shawn provides insight into how this can be accomplished along with ways to short circuit bad habits that have a deleterious effect on one's outlook. In the latter chapters, he focuses on concrete ways to modify one's behavior. The road to change can be arduous, but Shawn provides a road map that can be followed.<br /><br />I can see how his key ideas could enhance K-12 education. Far too often the motto in American schools is to work hard and then you will be successful and happy. This runs counter to the latest psychological theories of happiness and success. Current theories shared by Shawn show that \\"When we are happy-when our mindset and mood are positive-we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it.\\"<br /><br />While quantifying levels of happiness in a classroom situation may be tricky. Shawn points to the emotions of joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride amusement, inspiration, awe and love. How many American classrooms exhibit these qualities? Scientific data illustrates how positive emotions fuel brain chemicals. These chemicals make it easier for the brain to process new information and retrieve it quicker and can also aid analysis and problem solving. Just this simple morsel of information could make a huge difference in the productivity level of struggling students.<br /><br />The rest of the book has a treasure trove of information that can be applied to the classroom. I recommend this book to teachers who feel under pressure to raise the achievement levels of a low performing classroom as well as teachers who are lucky to be in an environment where test scores are not an issue. Understanding the mechanisms associated with happiness will shed light on a number of issues that will improve classroom environments as well as the overall quality of life.ysis and problem solving.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always Sparks has delivered. Not that I was expecting anything less. Wonderful read. Cant wait to see the movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is good except I don't like quests that you cannot complete without real money and sometimes it takes long to load.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've had this product just a few days, but I love this tool because of ease of use and it does everything I need.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I never saw it and have no intention of seeing it, but my newphew and husband liked it a lot.
B008MM9630|3.0|This is a good game. It is a little bit hard to figure out though. Overall I would have to rate this a 4out of 5 stars. I like this game very much.  Does anyone else agree with this statement?
0393327345|4.0|A lot of times people say that the book is better than the movie....in this case, the book IS the movie.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|The product was slightly beaten up on the edges, and on the normal DVDs were a few scratches.  From what I can tell, the discs are working properly, but I'm afraid of future issues.  Amazon probably should be more careful with their products.  I will say that it was wrapped twice, so a little extra protection there.  That was a plus.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It was awesome I love blowing the things up with tnt and it is also fun to fly the plane
B005MLOOJA|5.0|great shows! always something to look forward to, who can you trust and who is the backstabber.  you just never know.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|Some of my family liked it, most did not.  It was way over my kids' heads even though they love the Dr. Suess version.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. I recemend this to horse lover's. the grapgics are wornderful and never blurs. I lilve it.
0060936223|5.0|A beautiful and poetic look into the lives of two extraordinary people living in a vibrate 60s New York City. Inspiring and historically fascinating journey through art, poetry and music.
B000YR3WUE|4.0|I really enjoy the rich harmonies and unique sounds of this LP.  It was also an excellent value for the price from Amazon!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Yes. I did like Fragile and Close to the Edge back in the day, but I never owned the records (vinyl or CD). Somehow, maybe because of the bad reviews or because nobody I knew owned it, I never even bothered listening to Tales. And then, I recently stumbled unto it, and listened to it in a \\"Heaven's Gate\\" kind of way: can it be as bad as they say? And I was bowled over: this is an extraordinary piece of music. When I listen to it, I make sure I have 80 minutes ahead of me, so that I can immerse myself into it. Because that is what you have to do. And then the length, or the repetitions are not a problem, they are part of the journey. Sure, there is some padding, some jarring moments (especially in The Ancient), yet most of it is sublime. The texts don't mean much: so what, they do convey a feeling, and Jon Anderson's voice is like another instrument in the mix. Chris Squire is definitely less present than in previous outings, but I think the balance between instruments is better as a result. I can understand very well that Tales would turn off most people, there are many objective reasons for that, and yet to me, this album is up there with Smile as one of the craziest album concepts that actually succeed. Give it a try, you might actually fall under its charm as I did.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|can't wait for the movie I have ideas for the leads if E L .James would contact me we could make a great screen version

B003K1EYM6|4.0|When I tried to hook this directly from my card reader to my iPad 3 I got a message that the connector used too much USB power and would not work.  Fortunately it worked when I connected it directly to my camera, a Canon 5D Mark III.  I've heard it may not work with all cameras, so beware.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game has some bugs but really good ones. I got out of my house and saw about 50 diamond  blocks. love this game. I wish had more stuff like portals and wolfs  is there the nether in pocket edition?

Also one of my sister's favorites ... would recommend it to anyone who enjoys &#34;chick flicks&#34; ... A+ all the way
B008Y6QZ56|3.0|excellent acting, fighting, and story.  The combat between the brothers was very moving.  If you like cage fighting this is a good one.
B000062V9C|1.0|Be warned that Region 2 DVD's will not work on players in the USA (at least not any of my 3)  I had to return it, but the service of the return and the initial shipping from the seller was great.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Good movie with action, drama, suspense, great storyline, but was a little long. Two Thumbs up. It was worth the $4.98 I paid.
034580404X|4.0|Cheapest deal on the Fifty shades trilogy I found at the time. Books were in good shape but the box was a little banged up. All in all a good product but it took FOREVER to get here. That's my biggest complaint.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I never saw it and have no intention of seeing it, but my neices all liked it a lot.  Ages:  13, 14, 16, 20 and 23...
B008ASGP3U|5.0|This one involves Rebus as a retired detective working cold cases for the police department.  As usual, the scenery involves Edinburgh and the area between the City and Inverness.  I love these novels.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I've been waiting for him to do an album like this for years. It's a modern version of Gris Gris.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Thought provoking....life changing.....must read!  Take the time to read...as time flies from out of your grasp invest in the time to read.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I give it my top rating because I enjoy knowing it is waiting for me whenever I want. The show itself gets my full attention i am taken away by it. i hope they can keep it going as well as it has been going.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love playing minecraft! The only issue for me is that there aren't enough updates for the game. I'm new to mincraft and I really want to be able to use more features.
B0040I09RM|5.0|If you're a guy and you have run out of things to watch this is the perfect show!  I wish i had more time to watch.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This movie was incredibly bad -- the acting was pitiful but worse, the antagonist's sadistic behavior was revolting and difficult to watch.  We turned it off after 15 miinutes.  Do NOT bother to order this movie!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Like that of On her Majesty's Secret Service , Skyfall stands out to be a very different movie from the rest of the series. You get a more closer look at Bond the character with a fresh direction and a great story. If you ask most real Bond fans(like myself) they will all agree that On Her Magesty's Secret Service was the best if not one of the best because it had something different from the rest...more depth. I think Skyfall follows that with a look into Bonds past. It's tough to say which of the Bond movies were the best because each actor that  played the role made it their own. I loved all the actors that played bond. I never enjoyed the Brosnan series since they were weak with story depth and full of gadgets.  I really enjoy Daniel Craig and find he is one of the best Bonds. I think with all of the changes that Skyfall brings(including a new M), the series is really on a roll!
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Seriously I wanted to shut off my TV after 15 minutes into the movie, I painfully continue through it because I spent<br />the money to rent it.  Quentin presented the movie and that's why I even decided to watch this.<br /><br />RZA wrote this and acted as the main hero.  I gave Rob Zombie a chance, singer to movies and he nailed 4 movies that I love.  RZA was horrible,<br />the lines, the story and his acting... are you serious?  I love crazy asian films and understood this movie would be over the top but there was<br />no charming view to this crap.<br /><br />I want to punch Crowe in the face for doing this movie.
B008133MDK|5.0|A terrific update of Holmes.  Acting, writing are superb!  An incredible cliff hanger as well!!  A must watch for dans of Sherlock Holmes.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is really awesome and totally cool. I'm glad that the update fixed the malware problem. Now I can use the app with ease.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It's a good book plain and simple. It's through the eyes of an everyday American who turned into a hero. It shows you the good and bad side of war without any bs, but also not only the personal struggle that he went through but also the struggle his family has. It's a true testament to the type of people not only our veterans are but there families as well. I would recommended this book to anyone who wonders what the front lines are like it certainly opened my eyes. Also thank  you Chris for all that you have done for our country and thank you Kyle family for all your personal sacrifice
0007447868|3.0|As a big fan of the series, this book was a little bit less exciting than the others.  Especially after the first three, which I could not put down.  We're introduced to a lot of new characters that aren't as interesting as the 'main' characters and the story doesn't move along much.  The bits with Arya, Jaime, Cersei, and Sam are still good and it does pick up a little bit at the end.  Still a good book for sure, just not on the same level as A Storm of Swords.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its awesome because you get to have more than one game and my child loves it when he plays
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Timely, with Magdalen Asylum apologies underway in Ireland, this book transcends the blackness of abuse. Two people, each uniquely and thoroughly abused, fight for Life, big &#34;L.&#34; Only in combination, it turns out, do they succeed. But it is in the efforts each makes to grasp any available part of life that the story succeeds.<br />Well written and responsibly edited, the Kindle edition is a satisfying read.<br />I enjoyed vicariously visiting Ireland in the late 20th century, as I've never had the privilege in person. Major characters were rounded and lovable, from protagonists to their circles of close friends.<br />Although I anticipated the mystery's solution earlier than the author may have intended, it detracted not a bit from the final pages.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|But I'm at the point where if we had an hour about the Downton house mice I'd probably be enthralled.  The twists and turns never stop.  I'm not happy with a lot of those twists but I still love the show!
B0067R0APK|5.0|The 15 day extended forecast is Great. I use it everywhere we go. I have lots of cities in the Favorites so I can always keep updated.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have had no problems with this app on my kindle fire as far as I can tell. I've had the app for several months I think, kind of lost track of time!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Spent the day reading it, couldn't put it down. Very sweet. Predictable- sure but heartwarming nonetheless. Solid character development ad well written. A quick, entertaining read.
1452110581|5.0|What is it about the cat that makes it so fun to poke fun at?  I adore this book!  It is a cat lovers companion as well as a fun read to those who despise the feline!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|i wasnt all that thrilled but i was excited when i got in the mail. it skipped a scene in the beggining but its ok. i still love the movie
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, Gillian Flynn must have stayed up lots of night coming up with the direction(s) of this plot.  I really, really enjoyed the fact that I never could figure out what was in store for the characters.  A real page turner and I found myself a little blurry eyed one morning from the lack of sleep caused by not being able to put the book down.  Read it!
0345537998|5.0|I must confess I wasn't a huge fan of his SoIF series. Tuf Voyaging however, was something else entirely. From the very beginning I found the character of Tuf himself, about which the novel centers, to be utterly fascinating. George R.R. Martin has managed to create something I once thought impossible, a new archetype. I truly have never encountered another character like him in all my years. Fans of witty dialogue and hifalutin language will surely fall in love.<br /><br /> This is a standalone collection and should in no way be compared or even related to his other works.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I feel like I can hardly say anything about this without using spoilers, so I will just say it was highly entertaining and made me want to keep reading. I will also say, in what is hopefully a vague enough way, that the first half is kind of a whodunit, and the second half is more psychologically interesting and suspenseful in other ways. In general, I thought it was really creative.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is such a fun movie. Even my husband likes it. Good music, funny, mostly clean (for younger kids). The story line is very predictable, but the entertainment factor is well worth it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|plays great on my kindle fire -- kids and I are fighting over who gets to play, we love it!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great App! Absolutely fantastic - and categorized to give you excellent access.<br /><br />First app I recommend to friends. All have thanked me for the suggestion.
B00957T6X6|3.0|As to the stories...they are wonderful, engaging, full of suspense and keep you turning the pages into the wee hours...5 stars.  However, there are hundreds of characters surrounding a core set of main characters.  At the beginning I was writing down the family trees as I went along to keep myself clear as to who was part of each family.  Then my lovely daughter did a google search for some sort of chart to ease my efforts.  Fortunately, there is a wonderful legal sized chart of the main characters out there on the internet.  Unfortunately, she printed this out for me and thus, I do not have a link to share here.  That being said, my sister is also reading the series and she didn't want the chart as she felt the author gave enough clues in each chapter to remind you who the character was and what family he belonged too.<br />I originally purchased the 1st Kindle book which has no illustrations, cover sheet, appendix, etc.  Then I purchased the series of all 5 Kindle books.  This set has the title page, appendix, illustrations, etc.  Only 4 stars because I've had some problems navigating between the books.  I'm rather technologically disadvantaged so this could be my fault.<br />I'm adding more to my review here as I realized last night that my navigation problems are not my fault.  For some reason, several times after closing my kindle and then reopening later, I have lost the location I closed at.  This has never happened with a single Kindle book before.  Not sure if this is because of the 5 books or there is something wrong with my Kindle.  And to find your place that you stopped at is a nightmare with 5 books with no page numbers.  Not sure I would buy this many books combined again.  Sorry, but bringing my 4 stars down to 3, not because of the story, but because of functionality.
B003UPPO2G|3.0|It would be better if Blueray is available. Audio is acceptable. Packaging not to my expectation. It could have been better.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is a book for people who don't normally read or like books. If you actually read, this will be terrible.<br /><br />It was weird to check &#34;adult&#34; on my bookshelves. On one hand, obviously it's for adults given the explicit content. On the other hand, it is dumber and written worse than most of the young adult books I've read.<br /><br />A favorite quote from my friend Erin's review: &#34;15 sex scenes sewn together by variations on the following six sentences does not a story make.&#34; She also mentioned the inner goddess/subconscious thing, which was a not-at-all-veiled effort to have an angel/devil on her shoulder thing going on. Apparently it wasn't okay for the character herself to have conflicting opinions so she had to assign the negative/rational/chaste ones to the &#34;subconscious&#34; and the sexual/go-for-it ones to the &#34;inner goddess.&#34; I also totally agree w/Erin about the following:<br />--I, Christian, am screwed up, which is why I must be the Dominant, and I will say that I can only be this way despite the fact that I will then do all the things I say I can't do. But don't touch my chest.<br />--We can't work because we don't talk about our feelings even though we did just talk about how we feel, sort of, for the last 10 pages. Or over email.<br /><br />I'm not even going to get bent out of shape about the content, why someone would think about being submissive, especially outside the bedroom, etc., b/c this book is just not worthy of a real discussion.<br /><br />It wasn't much worse than chick lit like &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; (to which I also assigned 2 stars). It was mildly entertaining and I mildly cared what happened (a la Something Borrowed) but I mostly disliked the plot, writing, and characters! It's a quick read (except for when I didn't care what happened and therefore wasn't reading it). There is maybe a 10% chance that I'll read the next one, because as we all know (if you know me), I have trouble not finishing series even when they're bad. Oh well. The sex scenes are fun!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is, I believe, the fourth book in the Outlander series and the story is just as fresh and compelling as it is in the first book. I recommend it to anyone who loves historical romance fiction. It's several notches above your standard bodice-ripper!
0062082353|5.0|I love this book because you can tell that Chris Kyle is telling you the story of his service in the US Navy SEALS straight from the heart. He was a great man, a personal hero of mine, and will be sorely missed.
B003UF01SS|5.0|just what i was looking for great LP have played it many times and will continue to for many years to come!!!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is typical of other games of this type by this developer. I would give it five stars if not for the typos. Dialogue is a bit better than in previous games.
B001676320|4.0|The lead vocalist of Chicago can't hit the high notes not like in his early years. Earth Wind and Fire are excellent.
B007SGM084|4.0|It's a decent book but I have read better.  It's mostly sex throughout the book with a small but decent plot Line.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show but I am finding myseld addicted to the story lines.  I can't beleive I didn't what this show sooner.
B008Q08T54|5.0|Deep,intrigue.  Coruption,holds you to the end. With George Clooney and Matt D ,how could it go wrong??? Great Movie,Winner.  can't loose. LOL
0399157565|2.0|Is there anyone out there who disliked Postmortem or any of the first 6 or 7 Scarpetta books and now feels Cornwell has hit her stride and keeps writing winners?  Didn't think so.<br /><br />Where there used to be satisfying plots , the novels now rehash old routines.  To keep interested, a reader must then care about her characters.  But all of the main characters - Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy, Benton - have become one dimensional bores - hard to \\"like\\" any of them.<br /><br />Bone Bed has the usual Cornwell traits - supporting characters built up as suspects then either sloppily killed off or written out of the plot, and a twist ending in the last two chapters to wrap up the by then limping plot.  Hint: has she ever before introduced the real killer in the last few pages?  Yup.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:  you will regret wasting the hours plowing through these 400+ pages.<br /><br />Would've given 1 star but reserve that for the Isle of Dogs Andy Brazil series she published a few years ago.  Advice to Cornwell fans :avoid books with \\"dog\\" in the title - it's self predicting....
B001NLKT60|5.0|I thought this book was excellent and kept me on the edge of my seat - it was the best of all 3 books.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Highly recommendable. As if you are there in the live concert when you watch it with the big screen full HD. Great buy.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Always skeptical of remakes, I watched with scrutiny and reserve, but didn't take long to see and appreciate the quality and unique approach this version takes. Great cast, even though I normally do not care for Colin Farrell, and superb special effects and story line. I watched it twice during my 24 hour option time frame for the Amazon streaming video and will probably purchase the DVD.
030758836X|3.0|Married couple Nick and Amy seemed to have it all - money, good looks, writing careers, and a \\"perfect\\" marriage.  When Amy loses nearly all of her money and they both find themselves unemployed, they decide to move back to Nick's home town and Amy uses the last of her trust fund money to buy Nick a bar.  On their fifth wedding anniversary Amy goes missing and Nick is the number one suspect.  The first half of the book alternates between Nick's point of view and entries out of Amy's journal.  Is Nick behind Amy's disppearance?  All signs point to yes.  Halfway through, the book drops a major bomb on you that changes everything.  I actually dropped my Kindle and gasped out loud - the twist is THAT huge!  I will say this book kept me guessing the whole time and it's very well written.  If this book had ended differently I would have given it 5 stars, but the ending was a major disappointment.  I had some pretty strong feelings about these characters and what I wanted to happen, and the ending was a complete let down.  I almost threw my Kindle across the room!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addicting.... so much fun!!! Keeps the kids entertained on a long ride... and adults too! Would recommend to anyone, any age!
B00782O7IY|5.0|This movie is absolutely fabulous. I showed it to a group of friends and without exception, we all thought it was the most creative movie we have seen in decades.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|I love this series of movies, this was another winner. Kids will enjoy it, as much as I did and I'm 55.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have recommended this book over and over again to everyone I know. I read it a year before my father passed away and it was incredibly helpful to me emotionally.
B003Y5H556|4.0|Good camera work, storyline, soundtrack and fairly good casting, although not sure that Amanda Seyfried was the best choice for the lead character. I lay the blame on the director for keeping this from being a really good movie, rather than mediocre.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|For the fans of Jack Reacher and Lee Childs- Tihis is an easy read and entertaining at the same time.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Good movie with a unique twist at the end. Denzell Washington played role good.A must see movie.I bought it for my archives.
B002B0NAV8|5.0|You can not beat the price for this download.... you get the full album and the hidden track.  Quick and easy.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I have been playing and enjoying this game for some time now, despite that on occasion a ball will shrink in size and end the game prematurely.  I would have happily given this game 5 stars if that glitch was just a one time event; however, that is not the case.  I am a tad frustrated with the game right now as I was in the midst of playing my highest scoring game yet, when the shrinking ball thing occurred while I was on my 106th level with about 100 balls remaining. I will gladly change my rating if the game developer could fix this glitch, as it really is an enjoyable game.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love Jane Austen. Her stories, though written in the 1800s are timeless. The basic themes of love and family are something we can all relate to. Emma is one of my more favorite of Austen's stories. It is more humorous and lighthearted than some of her other more serious works (Persuasion and Mansfield Park come to mind). This version of Emma really brought out the natural humor in the work.<br /><br />Emma Woodhouse is a well meaning busy body. I have always found her character to be well intention-ed, if a little naive and pretentious. I think this version really does a good job of showing Emma's progression from a young child with little to no thought about the consequences of her actions to a more mature woman who is more apt to think before she acts.<br /><br />I love the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightly in this version. The actors have great chemistry. It shows their slow progression from very close friends to lovers. They truly care for the other, they can fight and quarrel and disagree and still love each other. Differences of opinion are not great barriers to their relationship as they might be in others.<br /><br />One aspect that I really loved about this version of Emma was that it really emphasized some underlying emotions and motivations that I hadn't noticed before. It really emphasized how sheltered Emma was by her father, how afraid he was to let her do anything or go anywhere for fear that he might lose her like he did her mother. Emma often states that she will never marry, citing reason after reason, but never really saying the real reason she didn't want to consider marriage. She is incapable of leaving her father, it would break his heart. She could never do that to him, so rather than longing for something she knew she might never be able to accept, she pushes away all desire to get married herself, stating that she never wishes to marry. Instead she contrives to get each of her friends married. She denies any desire to be married and instead projects that feeling onto nearly everyone around her in a desperate attempt to keep herself from any romantic attachment while at the same time vicariously fulfilling her own desire for marriage. She is constantly pushing suitors that she herself might like or who might perchance pursue her (Frank Churchill and Mr. Elton) off on her friend Harriet. It was an interesting aspect that I had never really given much thought to before, but was subtly brought out through this version.<br /><br />Overall, between the great acting, the fantastic sets and costumes, and the subtleties that are cleverly brought out this is my favorite version of Emma.
0786891416|5.0|I ordered this book on a whim because I love the '&#34;Castle&#34; series on ABC.  I was really pleased that the characters in this book are very much like Becket and Castle are on television.  The characters of &#34;Esposito and Ryan&#34; also hit the mark.  I was so happy with the way this book was written, I ordered the second in the series, &#34;Naked Heat&#34;.  I am sure I will buy the next in the series, too.  A real treat for &#34;Castle&#34; fans.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It was GREAT to see Harry back in action and following through with &#34;Everyone matters, or nobody matters.&#34;  I thought the weakness was his daughter and Hannah.  I did not find them likable.  Other than that, as a Harry Bosch follower, I enjoyed the read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't know how revolutionary or whatever this book is, but it's definitely a great read, enjoyable, and it has definitely had a lasting impression. I would recommend it.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|KindleFire version stops working every time....terrible app! Not sure how the creator of this joke of an app will not come up with a fix!
B002PEP4EG|4.0|Well written book with good insight.  Inspires and makes you think how to innovate and design outside the box with solid philosophy.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Fun and addicting. Once you start you want to play for hours.<br />colorful and each level is more Challenging and
B001LF347E|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows that i can watch with the kids and hubby.  Great series- wish they made more than 5 season.
B000VHVGM8|3.0|Good acting and some dark comedy.  OK to pass the time if you haven't seen it.  Second time was not as good since I knew the ending.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Pretty Good for another Mission Impossible foray. Was a fun thing to watch, if you like lots of action and are not too worried about the suspension of disbelief!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Nice little family movie.  Had some very funny parts in the movie.  Four stars because my daughter loved it more of a teen movie...as an adult I thought it was watchable.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great sound and light weight. I had 2 pairs where the right channel has cease to function. I assume the connection broke internally. I have no recourse but to trash it since the warranty expired and I tossed the packaging and receipt anyway. Buying them through Amazon is worth it though, I just wished they weren't so fragile and/or the wires so poorly 'soldered(?)' I bought 2 more but saved the receipt(s.)
B009O2XY12|5.0|It's fun and challenging . My hubby has this on his android and I downloaded it onto my Kindle. However, I don't like that I need to connect to the Internet to play it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|once I started reading I could not put it down I was hooked.  A very good read. Well recommended .  John
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I've seen this movie like 10 times, I just bought the blu-ray, I watched it on amazon demand last night, until it gets here (BTW, I cancelled an amazon on-demand subscription before, because of the quality, since then they have raised the bar, I watched the movie full screen last night, picture and sound were close to DVD quality).<br /><br />Back to Sunshine...The story, the concept, the effects in this film are amazing, only thing I'd beef about is the captain from Icarus 1, watch the movie, I know it was part of the theme, music.<br /><br />Everytime I see the end of this film, it makes my eyes water, when the physicist stands there, time stands still, he touches pure energy, all that goes on in the mission, to him, he's just doing his job, makes the best possible human decisions, maybe he talked too much in his videos back home, but the soundtrack is devastatingly wonderful in this film. It really raises the bar even more. Cool cast, alot of actors here have been in other films, or were on their way to bigger better projects. I'd have to say, this and Pandorum, are one of my recent sci-fi favorites. I'd highly recommend Sunshine.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This is the second part of a animated adaptation of the Frank Miller classic.  For anyone who loves, or just likes, Batman, it is a brilliant look into the future of both the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel.  Wonderfully done!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|There is not a lot of tech in the movie...had points where it was slow.  A good movie to rent on a rainy day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 even more than the first! I didn't think that was possible, but everybody should get this app. I mean, come on, its endless entertainment for free!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|All of these books could have been out into one. It was as if the author was pulling strings to have something to write about.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Very good movie, not overly done in action shots.  Very heartwarming!  It made you appreciate life for all creatures, great & small.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|First let me say this was an excellent book.  The science was believable, the character generation was great, you felt like you were on Mars.  The subject matter might deter many readers, but it was a fairly light read.  The science tied very nicely into the story, which many authors put the science in the story first and develop a story around it.  Kudos to Andy for a great novel!!<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, the only thing that might put me off was the language.  While it was not excessive, it was not necessary for the story.
B0037VNX44|4.0|This movie was very different. They did a great job in portraying the main character as a very disturbed person.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very interesting insight into the life of Chris Kyle, and his time in the SEALS. A real shame this warrior isn't still with us today.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Michael Oher's story is inspirational - he chose not to follow the pattern of his mother into drugs, but made something of his life. May we have an opportunity to help someone like Michael fulfill his dreams.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|All of these books could have been out into one. It was as if the author was pulling strings to have something to write about.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Finally got thos movie and at a good price! I have looked all over for this movie its very hard to find iut in town.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie but have not seen it in some time. But I bought it brand new for a very cheap price.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is a great game but I do not no how to expand my zoo besides that it is really fun
B007N85POS|5.0|This is a highly addictive game that is very, very fun to play.  My kids showed it to me and now I play it everyday for a few minutes just to get to another level.  It is very fun and you'll be glad you got this app.
B009ZRY0IC|5.0|I am a music lover....and I can't ever remember a time when I have loved listening to songs so much the very first time I hear them!  Absolutely LOVING this artist and album!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As always his books are hard to get in to. After page 100 the pace picked up and I finished it in a day. Looking forward to seeing the movie
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game truly is a lot of fun...when it works.<br /><br />I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game since I started playing, buying chips and coins. Unfortunately, the game freezes constantly and will kick you out mid game, losing your chips you put into it.<br /><br />The customer service is awful, you will get an automated response everytime you send a support ticket and it is impossible to get an actual person to respond to your issue, they also won't refund credits that you paid for and lost because of the glitches on their game!<br /><br />The most recent issue is their update on iPad, now it gives an error 401 when I try to login saying I am not connected to Facebook when I am, again...impossible to get a resolution from their customer service.<br /><br />With as many bingo games available I would absolutely recommend that you spend your money elsewhere and uninstall bingo blitz until they resolve their issues!
B009VB97EY|5.0|LOVED IT! This movie was awesome, I could watch this a 1000 times more. Good job guys!! Luv it. L
1592402038|5.0|Eats, Shoos & Leaves is a series of entertaining short stories about punctuation. My formal writing education ended with college composition four years ago, and out of necessity I grabbed this book used to improve my skills. The book hardened my confidence for when I use punctuation to express meaning and intent in my writing. Another great way to use this book is to read its bibliography. The author, Lynne Truss, uses the best sources to justify her usage arguments. This is a good starting place for students of writing and style.
B008B92U32|2.0|This would be a fun app but I found it very difficult to get it to actually work.  It is probably something I am doing wrong but it is not user friendly.  Neat and fun idea but difficult.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Entertaining and interesting story line. I enjoyed the book for casual reading. Able to pick book up and put it down in the middle of a chapter.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was good and kept me reading, BUT, all of the books could have been out into one. I wouldn't recommend reading the others.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The overall web page is very good. I have yet to search in detail all the options, but the ones that I have are very good. The program appears easier to navigate.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three books and I'm in  love thanks for writing these  books.  Amazing!!!!!!!!!!<br />Wish you could have continued writing about them.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best ever played. it is addicting to me. i am having one heck of a time with this game
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|One of the best movies made, and will watch again down the road.  Good acting, very good plot which made this Entertaining throughout.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good productoa an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase reallmente if needed would buy another product equal.
030758836X|1.0|This is a suspense story without suspense. Every plot twist is laboriously telegraphed.<br /><br />The story is implausible, and the characters are banal.<br /><br />I bought it for Book Club. Avoid it if you can.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It fit the Kindle very well. Am satisfied that it offers the protection that I wanted for the Kindle. I chose black because that colors goes with all my other cases. Have not had the case very long so I can not attest to its durability, but it certainly appears to be durable.
B008NMT684|4.0|Our son enjoys this app!  He is still a little young for it, but I think he grow into it.  Can't beat free!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a fun and quirky movie about not forcing ones' self to fit into the expected societal molds. It is well done visually and has an impressive cast to bring it all together. I highly recommend it.
B004XQO90E|3.0|Keeps one entertained for a bit, but nothing note worthy or would want to play it again soon which is why the three stars.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Other than the fact there were some parts already on the web page I didn't care. It was still too funny.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Great for the price.  I would recommend this collection to anyone looking for an awesome comedy movie.  Best movie collection ever.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is by far the most fun game app I have found and for free. I am endlessly surprised at the quality and lack of adds and issues. The puzzles are fun and the game can be enjoyed by everyone. I would pay for this app any day.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington was already my choice as the best living actor. With this performance he set the bar a few notches higher for everyone else. As an alcoholic blessed with nine years of recovery, this movie hit me like none other. Realistic portrayals of all characters & great performances by all. I walked out the theater speechless and had to add this movie to my small collection (which of course includes The Book of Eli).
B004OC07N0|5.0|I was recommended to read this book before my job transition. I was skeptical to start, but liked it a lot and think it's useful book for anyone who manages people
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You become like a member of the family, or staff.  Love this English Soap ready to watch Season 3!  What a great show with such talented actors.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I already love box features. The mobile app is a great extension of the service. It has already saved me trouble a few times after installing it.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|fun to play- i have used several other Mahjong ganmes and i like having a few options to play enjoy
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Whenever I try to play the app does not 'load' and it shuts down the whole app and brings me back to home.......but other then that its a really cool app.... before the 2nd one came out I started to the subway sufers is better and now I totally regret thinking that!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Very Good , however there are no subtitles in Portuguese or English. Very well paquing, DVD quality high, Very good.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I was attracted to the movie bc I am a former airline employee and wanted to be entertained. Well, I was in for a surprise. I knew that Robert Zemeckis always delivers and forget it about Denzel Washington however this movie is more than that. This movie is a perfect representation of a powerful trait of the human condition and that is the power of surrendering. This is hands down one of the best movies that I have ever seen and I will buy it and will recommend it as much as I can.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Picoult's books always come through for the reader. They show real people who suffer traumatic life experiences. Each character is well developed.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I don't know if this movie was overhyped or what but when I saw it it was like This is what everyone was so excited about?<br />It's not my favorite but it was good.  It seems to be a really long movie,<br /><br />What I did like is it shows a lot of scenery, they are all over the place in this movie, I liked the house in Scotland, I liked the bar that he drinks with the scorpion on his hand. I liked they diversity of the people used in this movie. The theme song is really good. I like that they are actually aging James Bond and not unrealistically keeping him young.<br />I liked how they showed how truly digital the world is and that if your out in public you are being watched by someone somewhere, I hope people see that and wake up to what is really happening to our world.<br /><br />I did watch this twice because I wanted to see the scenery again.<br />**Also this was one of the least sexiest and I appreciated that as I was watching this with my 13 year old.<br />There was sublety to it and I was glad to see that.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|what can i say it is facebook- it works jsut like the site, you do not need it if you have a 8.9 HD because you can access it via silk
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Six stars would be more fitting for this trilogy. The surround 5.1 audio was incredible, my room shook with every step the Rex took. The video clarity is also fantastic. I was recommeded to use Jurassic Park to test my sub-woofer. Boy! It really is good. I would recommend &#34;real&#34; audio and video lovers to get this trilogy.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I liked very much, specially for it's all season. The quality is quite good. There are subtitles in Portuguese and also translation in Portuguese. It was sent very quickly, with the Brazilian import taxes included. The only negative aspect is the pacage of the DVDs,which are not so done very well.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I can not remember my password so I can't get in, any suggestions? I would Love it I am sure!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Used for going through menus and settings easier than the front buttons of the camera. Saves time, and allows a more interactive menus format.<br /><br />  In the field, I turn the LCD on with the camera, set up what I need, compose the shot, then before hitting record, turn the LCD unit off to conserve power.<br /><br />  Works well, is always there when I need it!
B004I744AS|4.0|I can always find the words I need and pronunciations I need. If I need a translation from or into another language it is available. Good app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i play it all the time- it keeps my mind fresh and alert- i prefer it to bridges- completed most levels
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Did not know anything about the exploitation and atrocities committed in that time period by King Leopold's business venture in the Congo. Very well researched book and very enjoyable to read. This book brings to light acts of cruelty and callousness committed solely for greed and as the author points out, even though it can not be considered a true genocide (since it did not target a specific group) the waste and destrucition of human life that went on for decades there is appalling.
0345531965|5.0|I volunteered with  a Mennonite relief group back in the early 70's. what Grisham described in Latin America mirrored much of what I experienced in Africa. The book is wonderfully engaging and written so well that I had a hard time putting it down.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I didn't like most of the choices for puzzles and it was pretty hard to get the puzzle pieces to fit. Maybe I just didn't know how to play the game. I wouldn't purchase this and I probably won't play it much at all.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Your basic solitaire game,so if you like solitaire in it's basic form...this game is for you, so you should get it...stupid word requirement
B007HO392S|5.0|If you like or love Carrie or are just new to her music this has a lot of great songs. Love her voice and the songs content. I highly recommend it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I recently got my kindle fire hd as a gift, and one of the first apps I searched for was a battery app. By far Battery hd smokes the competition. It may not have an upfront presentation (showing the battery percent without opening the app), but it more than blows me away by its details, showing how much time I'd have if I wanted to play a game or watch a movie, per say. Perfect for managing battery life on trips. Even better is the app telling you how long it will take to charge. I can't tell you how many times this has saved my sanity on a &quot;visit to grandparents&quot;. This is an a+ life saver app.
B008TSVZHM|2.0|This is just a case. Nothing more. At about $6, it should be in Dollar Tree at a buck. Would never recommend at this price.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|This is an edgy classic album.  There are outtakes from the studio sessions... what a pleasure to hear the songs go their their evolution.<br /><br />Anyone who says Lonnie Mack did the Roadhouse Blues solo, for Robbie Krieger, will be proven wrong.... as the takes were done complete as a band, not via tracks.  Bruce Botnick did a lot of snipping work on the ABSOLUTELY LIVE album, but here, it appears to be &#34;as laid down&#34;, and clearly Robbie is wailing thru Roadhouse Blues.<br /><br />Moonlight Drive has a few outtakes, Peace Frog, the amazingly soft Blue Sunday (with great work by Robbie again).  Its a classic album, and a &#34;must have&#34; on any Doors short list.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is so popular, the Kindle is popular and again I am thankful I can have this app on the Kindle HD Fire!!!  Happy camper, Me!
B00479SVBU|3.0|I bought a 30GB super low profile thumb drive and can take my music from both my MAC AND my PC onto the same drive (iPOD can't do that), and play it in the car. There are a few downsides: (a) this device sometimes has problems loading when you don't remove it from the car lighter regularly (simply pull it out of the car lighter plug and put it back in and it works perfectly; (b) if you don't turn it off, it will run all day plugged into your battery (8 hours didn't ruin my car battery); (c) it is designed with the car lighter Male part installed so it is not functional in other settings, (d) the remote only works at close range, directly pointed at the device, so not in the back seat and not while you're driving at the wheel...you're just going to have to manage it using the interface.<br /><br />STILL - until they make iPODS that can take a USB drive a fraction the size of a NANO that is compatible with everything for a quarter of the price...this is a good car solution. If you're looking at this you already know that many car stereos don't have the auxiliary output, so this devise is the perfect solution to messy auxiliary cord and the reception on this one is much better than the one I spent $100 on at Target on my last road trip.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is the best. it is not as good as the xbox edition. that isn't the point.  but it still is cool
B002O5M4SA|5.0|An amazing fairy tale with guns.<br />Love, trust and corrupted world.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, Jean Reno, a young Natalie Portman (best role of her career I think).<br /><br />EVERYONEEEEEE!!!!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|fun game that keeps you moving. Easy, but not boring so give this one a try. Free helps it also.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas & she loves it.  Of course she pretty much loves anything that is One Direction so it was an easy thumbs up.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|If you like your weather live, then this is the app to get. I just love high techy weather apps, the more real, the more I like it, and this one is like that...
030758836X|5.0|This is a real page-turner -- I read it over the course of 2 days and was fascinated by all its twists and turns.  Just when you think you know what's going on, something happens to make you see things differently... and again, and again.  The main characters are &#34;crazy&#34;, but as &#34;every jest has some truth in it&#34;, this tale can make you think about your own relationships and those of others you know.  Isn't there often some degree of pretense, of hiding some of who we are, no matter how close the relationship?  Can any husband or wife truly &#34;know&#34; each other?  People often argue violently, but don't usually cross the line into actual violence.  But there is sometimes a thin line between sanity and insanity.  These characters live on that line, and they take you on a wild ride.
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book for my 15 year old son, and he really liked it a lot, so did my 19 year old
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great twist at the end, never expected it - and Denzel's never disappointed us in a movie. Definitely a one to watch.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Even with there so called, &#34;updates&#34;, don't waste your time. It has Utube as one of its options, and you can get Utube to work fine with there own &#34;to your TV&#34; link, that are on most Blu-Ray players, to your tablet, so, forget this, unless they get a real fix that works.
B007HEOTHC|5.0|Sunset Boulevard, in my opinion is truly a classic and possibly one of the finest cinematc stories of all time.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I have an HTC smartphone and the greatest weather app I  have ever seen in my entire life! I am a weather watcher and so a weather app is an absolute must for me and to have it on the Kindle is pretty great and awesome!!!
B00BC5FN2C|3.0|This started off very slow and I found myself actually drifting away from the screen but somehow Kevin Spacey seemed to keep it going for l3 episodes.  A fine actor he is who could make this lackluster overblown story of intrigue in politics limp along for so long and hold my interest.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It is inspiring, full of beautiful images and depth.<br />I highlighted much of the book and keep going over those fragments over and over again. As a believer, it made me rejoice about the beauty of faith and how it makes life trascendent.<br />So many symbolic elements can be found throughout the book! I keep discussing it with my family, and have recommend it to a lot of friends and specially to young people who are searching for clarity regarding their believes and meaning of life. It made me laugh and cry and give thanks for the beauty of life.Although english is not my first language, it wasn't hard to read because it is very well written: clear, interesting and even funny at times.<br /><br />Es un libro hermoso que todos deberían leer.Esta lleno de imágenes bellas y profundas.Todo el libro es a las vez un viaje fantástico y una metáfora del viaje de la vida. No importa si el lector es creyente o no,  el autor permite que  se cuestione y  reciba una mayor claridad sobre sus creencias. Me hizo reír y llorar y dar gracias por mi fe. Se lo recomiendo a todas las personas que aman lo bello, lo simple y lo puro.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I loved all the individual ones, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but them all together is great! I hope there's a follow up version.
B008TT7CXW|2.0|This is just a case. Nothing more...just a case. Nothing more. At about $6, it should be in Dollar Tree at a buck. Would never recommend at this price.
1476715904|5.0|This book really got to me.  I mean, blubbering, snot everywhere, kind of got to me. I was a mess.  I had to take breaks just to deal with it.  And I say all of this because the book hit home.  I could relate to the characters in ways that broke my heart and brought up memories that were still raw within me.<br /><br />I got this book because I recently read Hopeless and loved it, so I thought I would try the author's other books.  I was more than impressed by this book.  I was blown to bits, shattered, torn apart, and craved more.  The characters are so real, and their situation so unnerving.<br /><br />The author did an incredible job with this book.  I am now a fan for life because any author that can make me feel a million emotions at once, is a keeper.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best show on television.! The casting, acting, scenery and costumes are extraordinary. Nothing can compare and the seasons keep getting better.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|It was pretty interesting.  I was looking for ways that I could improve my learning skills.  It was for me kind of a bad news, good news scenario.  The bad news is there is no quick and easy way to become highly skilled at anything.  It requires thousands of hours.  The good news part is even ordinary people can do it if they are motivated to practice hard.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Couldn't finish it.  I got about 30% read and had to stop.  Hope this helps. I needed five more words.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app - easy to use! I love the devotionals offered and the ability to switch from one version to another so easily. It really helps keep me going. I can pull up a scripture anyplace because I can download some versions so I wont need wifi access.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I used to play pinball when I was a lot younger!  Very happy to find an app. for pinball for the Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I'm having a blast. This is very interactive. I highly recommend this game.
B009K0P10K|2.0|Season one was very good.  The writers seem to have lost their way.  The plot is now incomprehensible.  Too bad, but like many shows, it simply ran off the rails.  Bizarre.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Love the characters.  Could relate to many of them.  Great to see a movie about seniors and the challenages they face.  Great ending too!
0099527936|5.0|Loved the story line and author did a great job of putting you in the moment.  Wonder about Stalin followers today?...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fantastic hope there is more to come. Truly enjoyed this series.<br /><br />E.l. James has written the very good books! !
0307730697|5.0|This is the story of a true hero.  Made me cry. It's interesting to see the biography of a Christian written by a non-believer. He's very respectful in his treatment of the subject. Interesting.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Glad to hear van Morrison coming out with another album.  The sounds do reflect some John Lee Hooker styles.  Great album
B005MMYCY6|4.0|Can't help it, I'll watch anything with Joseph Gorden-Levitt.  Good, strange movie. Quite entertaining if you can suspend<br />your version of reality.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Waiting for Bella to make up her mind, and not lead Jacob much.  Hearbreaking for him to be just waiting around.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I never had thought much about the first World War.  I found that fascinating.  I particularly enjoyed the female leads.
0307596885|5.0|In what she calls her last collection, Alice Munro again gives us a taste of Canadian rural and small town life over the last 80 years.  There is also a bit of autobiography, but while acknowledging it, Munro cleverly notes it is not pure.  She apparently did not like her parents, but she treats them with grace and understanding, without illusions or sentimentality.  One might say the same of all her stories.  Munro has a style such that when I finish one of her stories, I feel as if she told me the story rather than as if I had read it.  I can still hear her voice in my head.  Like poems, her stories have no surplus words:  momentous changes occur between sentences, a particular word throws the previous pages into a totally new light.  I hope this is not her last, but if it is, we can still start with her first and read through her canon again.  It will still reward us immeasurably.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This version will not let you search for things you want to see.  I did not download this to my Kindle - my husband did and I wish I could get rid of it!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Delicately developed characters, not delicate characters. I could easily empathize with the characters, and even more so as the story and the series progress.  This is truly a book I couldn't stop reading.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I love cheesy movies, so this one was great. Cheap price for a movie and it is worth watching so many times over and over!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What a way to end this trilogy, with Batman coming Back into play.  The story was really great, with real surprises at the end!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is like a piece of cake. almost everybody loves it but some are allergic to it. just buy this game
0792844890|5.0|I would recommend this movie to other people that have a cheesy sense of humor. This is a classic movie for me with an excellent cast.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Will every one get what is coming to them? Maybe, maybe not. Interesting idea. I will now look for her other books.
B009JBZH54|5.0|great trilogy, what better way to own it than on blue ray, it was a great deal at the time, happy i got it
B0054SMID0|4.0|I am an avid fan of Matthew McConaughey<br />He plays a lawyer very well<br />It was a little slow to hook me,but when it did,I enjoyed it.<br />I gave it a 4 because of the slow start,Ibelieve anyone who likes Court Room Drama<br />would enjoy it.I would reccomend it to.any of my friends.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|In contrast to the many good Asian films or even so-so Asian movies that &#34;Iron Fist&#34; is attempting to replicate, Iron Fist falls flat. The story is simplistic and the movie only stands out because of the known stars in the film and the over emphasis of blood and gore. Once one realizes that its a cheapo flick and lets go of expecting too much, its an ok &#34;one watch only&#34; rental movie, not a keeper.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Beautiful graphics, good storyline, nice HO scenes, and a good length. Very suspenseful and appropriately creepy music. Can't wait for the sequel.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I have been a life long fan of star trek. Until now I thought the motion picture was the worst of the movies but it has been topped. This movie features mediocre acting and a plot that erases nearly 50 years of star trek history. The best part of the movie was when I fell asleep, wonderful power nap!
B004GGTAQE|5.0|To read from the viewpoint of the enemy was a real eye opener. I can understand his position but don't always agree with his reasoning.
B00701QRB8|5.0|I play music with Doug Moon from the orignal &#34;Beefheart&#34; band so I knew what I was getting...Love the old stuff!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it! I couldn't put the book down. I work full time and have 2 young kids but I managed to find the time to read it in 3 days. I am addicted!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chief Kyle writes in a way we can all relate too. With his untimely death this book is a look into the sole of a Man that did things so others did not have too. He is an inspiration for all of us to live up too.
1936608898|5.0|This book changed the way I think about food for good.  It is a must for anyone embarking on Whole30 or just wanting to eat healthy and keep eating healthy.  I think I balked at changing my eating habits for so long because I knew I would not stick to it.  This book has changed that for me.  I am just going on two months of eating healthy and my body is changing daily.<br /><br />Just buy this book.  Just do it.  You won't be sorry!
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|This was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I love Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. It had good special effects and the story kept my interest.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|Very pleasant documentary with interviews of Jiro and his two sons and some of the restaurant workers.  Jiro said he lived &#34;on his own&#34; from age 9 and he has dedicated his life to providing the very best sushi in Tokyo.  The interviews and the scenery keep the documentary moving along nicely.  It was interesting to see how the fish are chosen from the market, and how different kinds of sushi are presented for eating.  I learned a lot from the movie and I enjoyed watching it!
B003Y5H542|5.0|I loved this movie. I wish there were more like it. I watched it over and over when I first got it. I never get tired of it. The characters are really interesting fresh and new. Good story line as well. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is complex. U press down it goes up. U press up it goes down. And the price is so much. Please don't waste your money for this useless stupid building game. Even if u see other reviews saying you have got to get this, do not!!!!!!!!!
160094048X|5.0|This book will demonstrate to you that vegan cookies can be delicious and easier to make than regular cookies. I am no longer vegan, but use this book to make cookies all of the time because the recipes are simple, require fewer ingredients than many non-veg recipes, and the results are often very good. There is an espresso brownie recipe which is fantastic, and I recommend the oatmeal cookie recipes. Side benefit of vegan cookie recipes: you can eat the batter too!
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Michael Connelly is an excellent writer.  The book was a thriller and it kept my interest, didn't want to put it down
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Good family disection.  Good acting.  Good story.  Good character development.  Good cinemetagraphy.  Good music .Good costumes and scene settings. Good price and shipping.  This set has been discussed so much there is nothing more to say.
B009JBZH54|5.0|all three films are great.  the box set itself is made of high quality materials.  2nd and 3rd movie each have a bonus disc.  can't beat the price.
B004HO6I4W|3.0|Very colorful movie. Other than the dog slobbering in the movie, I really enjoyed it. A great movie for the whole family to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Very exciting throughout the whole book, loved Peeta Mellark & I can't wait to read the next two books.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|My spouse & I rented this to watch together & we were both so bored! Also, just over halfway through the movie the streaming started freezing so we gave up & didn't bother to finish it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great page turner. Very entertaining. Loved yet another book by Baldacci!<br /><br />. . . . . . . . .
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a sweet book with a conclusion I did not expect.  It is an easy read and you will not be disappointed.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Whining her way through this story the author shares little about what truly led to her being &#34;found&#34; on the PCT, beyond sore feet due to her own poor planning.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|By now almost everyone who is anybody here in the United States has seen this film. It is a classic that I enjoy watching on other days not only the Christmas season. Fully of laughs that everyone will enjoy. You would have to not like comedies to dislike this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game...o my this game is sooo fun:D this game is my favorite game and my second favorite is temple run... o my I'm in love;)
B005LAII1C|5.0|He has enjoyed the movie.  I ordered a little late & it still got to me even w/ all the back up Christmas mail rush on time.<br />:)
B004TI5N38|5.0|I'm a big fan of David Baldacci's books and this one is one of my favorites. Gripping story, great suspense!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think this game is great for kids. It's better than angry birds. It's so fun I can't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game I'm so glad that I downloaded it from the app store I really like it
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I Never played Angr Birds before but I play this one all the time! Try it you will like it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing!!<br />I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to begin the next book. This book has me eager to know what's going to happen next.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The Irish setting was interesting, the characters engaging, the plot well developed.  The flashbacks were excruciating, so even though the ending seemed a little contrived, I was glad the characters finally found some happiness.
B003WJ81MA|5.0|Great mythical adventure with excellent casting too! Watch it & enjoy! I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great escapist fantasy-adventure flick.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|Would like to see some additions such as blender and a few others but is certainly worth the money.<br />May be that I have just not found everything yet.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Didn't want to put it down, sometimes predictable but with a turn here and there was a very engaging read.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|Great CD! Sounds as good as it probably did when it was released.<br />BUY IT! You'll feel better if you do.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Love Tom Rob Smith!!!  Great story!!  I was captured from the beginning and could not put it down!!  Will read more of his books for sure!
B008476HBM|5.0|Delivered instantly to my kindle. It is an absolute classic that I highly enjoyed. I would recommend my friends to get this too.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Excellent beginning to the show.It is a fast paced and well thought out intro to our country and the espionage community after 9/11. The main characters are given brief introductions allowing for growth  in future episodes. I urge you to try thisshow
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My wife and kids watch this movie at least twice a week. It's a really great movie for everyone in the family.
0765325950|5.0|I loved all of the books and this one was the icing on the cake. I will miss Mr. Jordan!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I purchased this for my Kindle but, I ended having to return the Kindle after all, it wasn't able to do what I needed.  My son had purchased a Kindle also so, I was able to pass this case over to him and it worked great for him.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I didn't expect to like like this book as much as I did but it was the most interesting book I ever read .  I guess the fact that my business was an early adapter of the mac for desktop applications may have something to do with why I liked it but I think anybody would enjoy it.  The life of Steve Jobs is interesting in itself, however, the way it's written, no holds barred, is excellent.  Jobs managed Apple the way I would have liked to manage my company but everybody probably would have quit on me.  Excellent book.  I can't recommend it high enough especially to someone that used macs from early on.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't watched the show, don't expect it to be just about zombies. It has a great story to it. I think it's very accurate on how the apocalypse would be. How sick and demented people would be left to ruin the last bit of humanity.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my kids and they absolutely love it.........they watch it 3-4 times a week.. Hilarious movie for the kids or even the parents.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This was the best thing for a long plane ride. My son loves the different transportation vehicles and enjoys all the puzzles.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|captivating story.  enjoy the &#34;doing the right thing&#34; outcome at the end of the movie.  Not sure why the heroine addict character needed to be in the movie ?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the book because of the hype. I kept reading it because the hype was real.  If you've seen the movie before reading this I feel sorry for you because the movie is sure to soil some elements the imagination would more naturally develop otherwise.<br />Great read for any young adult or adult looking for a fun and exciting read that meshes romance with tragedy. Don't let the word Romance discourage you though (guys).  As a man, I can say it wasn't only a &#34;chick&#34; kind of romance novel. Let the title be your key indicator here. How do you mesh Games, Death, and Starvation with Romance?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I hope the creator. of this game gives us more!  I love going back to try and get all three stars!
B001NLL8LA|3.0|Ok<br />This is slow starting book<br />Teacher likes the Midwest<br />I. Need ten more words and find this exercise futile.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Who doesn't love Bones! Great viewing on the computer, tv, or kindle. Easy streaming with little to no interuptions. :)
B008ZVNC2O|5.0|It's so good to have a new CD from Mick!  I love this one.  Mick's voice is still pure gold.<br />Love it!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved this book so much that I could not put it down.  I would highly recommend it.  You will not regret the purchase!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Track by track this cd is really good. I am now a huge F.U.N fan after listening to this album.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Our family of four watched this movie with reserve, at first, but really liked it at the end.  The characters aren't too over the top or unrealistic that you can't relate to them.  Typical overprotective father, silly &#34;teenagers&#34; in love, monster humor, good music.  I would watch this movie, again!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app is so much better than the free version. My son and I both love to play this game.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Yeah, it's got some corn in it, but overall - we enjoyed it!  It was funny, fast and above all - action packed!  I recommend it for your next movie night!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|all my books on my android, it makes it so much easier , and i dont have to carry a bulky tablet or a kindle around.
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|I got this for my gf 2 years ago, we have tried to use it like 20 times.  It is still in its box.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Having a favorite channel icon set to my local NPR station as my morning companion has been very comforting. This app hasn't let me down.
B008NMT684|5.0|Easy for my toddler to use and he loves all the trucks! The puzzles are very fun and interactive for the little ones.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Yep, the thrills/chills are there.  It was a nicely-made movie that was enjoyable from start to finish.  Get the popcorn and soda's and get ready for a very nice movie night!
B000003TAW|5.0|Anyone who doesn't provide a 5 star review for this album, isn't a fan of rock, pop/punk, whatever you want to call it. And it doesn't even matter what genre you stick them in, this album almost transcends classification. When one of my 60yo relatives starts singing, \\"the sea is foaming like a bottle of beer\\" out of the blue, I think you can say that this album has the ability to touch a chord in anyone. It is simple, 3-chord rock, true. But there isn't a lull in the music anywhere, every note fits perfectly where it is, and the lyrics are very enjoyable. I think I connect with In the Garage the most because of the 'posters on the wall' and playing D&D ('12-sided die') as a kid. This CD has been in constant rotation in my car since it came out, and almost every playlist I make for parties has at least one song from this album on it.<br /><br />One of my most enjoyable memories surrounding this album is related to how I found out about them. Paul Gilbert used to do a column for Guitar World magazine, and would review new CDs. When I was in college, I had a subscription and always read that column just to keep up on new music. I remember him giving this album 5 stars with something in the review like, \\"pop punk perfection.\\" So I hit the local music shop (who was playing the album as I walked in the door without me knowing it). I bought it, took it home, and popped it in the CD player. I was absolutely blown away with how catchy this album was, and I am still to this day blown away. If you don't already own this, I highly recommend it. I think it is an excellent addition to almost anyone's collection.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|Some of the songs on this album I like some I don't like just like most every album any artist records.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a fun game..I always have a hard time putting it down :)  I do however wish they had more characters to pick from!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|this is my new favorite tv show. the ease of watching this on the kindle fire (first generation) was awesome.
0810989956|5.0|My daughter who is 10 years old and has special needs just loves this book!!  HSe takes it on car rides and waits in the doctors office or just about everywhere we go and she does it in her bed at night before lights out,  There are a bunch of pages to fill in yourself and they make you think about your life and what you like and don't like.  SHe really enjoys it and I would definetly buy this for another child as a gift!!
B003W77SAS|3.0|This is my least favorite ELO album, ironic because it is one of their best selling discs. In short, if I wanted a disco album I would buy a disco album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the storyline. Full of twists and turns and many surprises. The characters are true to their time in their actions and reactions.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|So excellent! Could (and have) watch again and again and again. Great true story, excellent cast...there is nothing not to love.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Usually I don't leave reviews but I have to let parents that have small children know that this is a great movie. Very entertaining for even the most active children. Great story plot for the parents also:)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has awesome scenes and keeps you wanting more. I am looking forward to the sequel.  You will enjoy it too! Try it and you will be hooked.
1582406723|4.0|Always wanted to get into the TV series, but don't watch much TV these days. I've heard the buzz surrounding it and recently discovered that it was inspired by the comic by Robert Kirkman. Was not familiar with Kirkman's work but I love zombie tales and after reading the introduction it sounded very interesting. Tony Moore's art also reminded me of Steve Dillon's work and gave it a \\"Preacher-like\\" flavor. Took me about an hour to finish, couldn't put it down and it reads right through, no breaks at all. I recommend it if you're every stuck in your home on a snow day. Enjoy<br /><br />MoPop
1592407889|5.0|I found this book fascinating and read it in several days.  For anyone with a less than perfect childhood (which applies to many of us) it will hit home.  Sachi's situation though was a bit more drastic than most.  She is obviously a born survivor, and not to the credit of her parents.  Bravo Sachi for finding your way through life alone.<br /><br />I have always found Shirley MacLaine fascinating.  I am a believer in many of the things she believes in.  My daughter is 32, is an intuitive who lives now in Sedona, Arizona - she was born with a gift, so I am familiar with her beliefs and have been since she was very young.  I therefore somewhat believed in Shirley MacLaine's \\"gifts\\".  I see now though that Shirley and my daughter are two very different individuals.  My daughter is a loving, kind and caring individual, a wonderful mom, whose life is devoted to healing and helping people spiritually.  I can't say the same about Shirley MacLaine.  No one could have treated a child like you did without being motivated by greed and the movie star limelight, and casting your child aside in the process.  You've lost a fan in me Shirley MacLaine - no person gifted by Spirit would act the way you did.<br /><br />Congratulations to you Sachi for surviving it all and being such a good mom to your children.  Karma - I hope it rewards you ten fold.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|The book is a fantasy about some very wealthy environmentalists who decide the best thing they can do to save the planet is to kill off everybody but themselves.  It's good fantasy, and sometimes makes me wish I could be one of them.  The story moves along with typical Clancy verve.  I don't care much for Tom Clancy, the person, but I do like a couple of his books: this one and &#34;Red October.&#34;
159102594X|5.0|this was an excellant series. Possibly some of the best characters in any trilogy i've ever read in this genre. Looking formard to reading many more by this author!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This item is good.  However, it is sometimes difficult for the tablet to stay up and have to change it a couple of times so that it can stay up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A total thrill ride. I am so happy I don't have to wait to get the full season when it's released on DVD
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I play this game on my down time at work and i find it to be a great time killer.<br /><br />You balance your device to make a fish swim around and perform various tasks.<br /><br />The only issue i find is that the tasks are all the same so the game starts to get a little boring after a few minutes but hey i cant complain because it was a free app for me so thats why i rated it 5 stars.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great game to play during your lunch break or in a doctors office, do yourself the favor and pick this one up :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is ALSOME ever one in my class that has a kindle fire has this game and loves it
0670026603|5.0|This story is beautifully written and exemplifies the true meaning of loving another.  It explores the depths of a loving relationship that is very unusual and tender.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Personally I think it's not really the best game. It's confusing I don't get  it.what's the goal to do? You just build something and see what happens I mean seriously. Like get this: on Angry Birds you try to hit the pigs to kill them for  stealing their<br /><br />eggs and on the Rio Angry Birds you try to help the birds go free from their cages I mean who agrees????????? I'm so glad I got the FREE kind. I read the other reviews I got it READ this one don't get it. One more thing: If you get it get the FREE one. P.S. It's a rip off for kids they try to get it and it takes 5 minutes to download and they're so excited to play when they play, It's a disappointment. Two words: TERRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found it to be an exciting page turner  Even though you probably know what will happen next it was still a good read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very good did not want to put it down strengthen next one now can't wait to see what's in store
030746363X|3.0|If you never saw an old movie called \\"Sitting Pretty\\" with Clifton Webb get it out tonight! Timothy Ferriss is the Mr Belvedere of the 21st century. Mr Belvedere was an eccentric hired to babysit a child in unusual circumstances. He was a self-proclaimed expert on just about everything inlcuding yoga which was very ahead of its time. He gradually streamlines everything in the household, much as the author attempts to do in this book. I read through the table of contents with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. The hardback is so heavy you need a lectern to read it on. The diet is rather unappealing and I disagree wholeheartedly with some of his ideas. But wait, isn't the whole point of the Four Hour Work Week to get more enjoyment out of your life? Well, if eating a paleo diet and taking cold baths appeals, go ahead. As always the author is driven by results, which sort of defeats the pleasure principle in my opinion.  Having a ripped body is the modern status symbol but the author overlooks the cumulative effects of injuries, radical dietary shifts and rapid weight loss.  It's not for everyone and I'm betting long-term it's not healthy.  Timothy Ferriss has such a passion and zest for life but there's all this pressure everywhere in the book. You feel him hurrying from one topic to the next. You might as well go back to your cubicle for 60 hours a week! Finally, as a woman, I find the 15 minute orgasm well-intentioned but insulting. Again, results drives everything. Many women can have an orgasm in a couple of minutes in the right circumstances but would prefer a couple of hours of passionate, sweaty love-making with a gorgeous hunk even without an orgasm but with a peaceful nap at the end much preferable!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a good tool to have for my kindle fire it comes in handy when I need to figure out tax on things I buy.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|The game itself is very good, but....I've been reading that porn adds have  been popping up...I mean seriously...my 8 year old neighbor, and his 4 year old brother play the game...really inappropriate....seriously...MMMM.....very disappointed
B00BESM14U|5.0|I read this book and couldn't put it down... the movie was just as sweet!  The main actor does an amazing job!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than predecessor. Great gameplay and graphics. Would highly recommend. Very addictive. Best game for the Kindle fire, words with friends excluded.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoy reading books about dogs. I hadn't read a book as seen from the dog's view. I would highly recommend this one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I love the design and I know you will love it too!!<br />It has wonderful quests!!<br />Wonderful designs and such!<br />I love mystery games and if you like them to, you will love this awesome<br />Game!!!
1451695195|5.0|it is everything I was hoping it would be.i found it to be very informative. it came at a time in my life where I was looking for answers.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a wonderful book, well written and easy to read. I believed in the afterlife or better said a continued existence outside of our human form. I recommend this book for everyone.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I got this for my wife as a Christmas present (she is a HUGE fan of the show) and we spent the 2 days following Christmas laughing and enjoying this set!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Just saw them in concert and they are as amazing live as they are on this album. Buy it, buy it, buy it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Very nice movie and great visual effects.<br />Denzel Washington is his best shape.<br />Soundtrack amazing with Rolling Stones´s songs!<br />Highly recommended.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|If you like the TV series, you will think you recognize the plot of the story.  But do not be fooled, it is not going to end where you think it will.  But what will happen is you will be sucked into the better of the two Walt Longmire worlds.  I had made the mistake of putting it down for a week or so, but when I got back to it I blew thru the series.  I also like how the author will put a nugget in the story that will unfold in the next book as a major or minor storyline.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Watched the whole series on TV, liked it so much I wanted to see it again without commercials. Two more words!
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran has so much talent!  With just a guitar, he has created such an array of great songs ranging from beautiful love songs to some cheeky rap!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I don't mind the sex scenes, but really not well written.  Story is weak. Aurhor can't really be considered a pro
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It keeps me in such suspense from from episode to the next, I have fallen in love with the characters. I can hardly wait to buy the # 3.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We'd never watched Castle before but our piano teacher's husband told us about it when we were talking about NCIS. Thought we'd check it out so we bought the first season, liked it and then went for the second season. I don't like to start a series in the middle so this has been great. I highly recommend.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I fell into watching a marathon of the the first half of this show on TV and wanted to go back and see the history of these characters...WoW...loved it from the first episode forward...A MUST SEE
068817776X|4.0|Loved this book and the coverup the wife has to go through for survival.  Very intriguing.  Good read and a true story.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|It came faster than I expected, and they are great.  I can't say much more about this one except I love it.
B003K16PAU|5.0|What the reader can not fail to admire about this tale was the author's ability to objectively witness his own, deep hardships without flinching. While his personal deprivation cuts to the very core of physical existence his vivid descriptions avoid the blame game of cursing society for his destitute circumstances. While others would be ground down from such impoverished situations, Orwell simply gets polished up, proving (at least to this reader) that the neo-classics are the best reflection for the contemporary human soul.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We'd never watched Castle before but our piano teacher's husband told us about it when we were talking about NCIS. Thought we'd check it out so we bought the first season, liked it and then went for the second season. I don't like to start a series in the middle so this has been great.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The movie itself is amazing. But...  I was really disappointed in the 3D version. It was good, but not what I expected... I think Pirahnna 3DD was a better &#34;3D&#34; movie (Sadly). But having said that...  Its still Avatar, and that means great movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hey Ghostpig here this book<br />Was a incredible ending for<br />This great series Ghost pig signing<br /> off better than most books
034580404X|2.0|It could  of  been  done in  one  book not  3 .  i felt  like  I  read the  bood  some place  before
B000VUCIZO|5.0|I bought this book of Japanese edition first, and found it was great. So, I bought this book once more but in English and enjoyed again.
0515142247|5.0|Decent read.  Realistic story and it is good to read about Hero's like Jack Reacher.  I thought the killing of the Main Bad Guy could have been more dramatic, and losing the girl in the end was not cool either.  A Good read and i would recommend it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Simply put. The Godfather and The Godfather II are the 2 best movies ever made. Period.  And this set is without a doubt the best way to watch these movies... You'll be sorry if you don't buy this box set...
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was a incredible story<br />I suggest it for all young readers<br />It has such a good mix of romance<br />And action
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I loved this book.  I hated to put it down.  I am definetly going to purchase another in the Jack Rescuer Series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not what I was expecting I guess all the hype made it out to be more than what<br />It is. I found it a little on the boring/ dull side:-( . I love the character  Christen he was mystical<br />Weird and somewhat sexy. I feel that it was a good story but not -ALL THAT.
B0098R6M1M|5.0|Great acting and newsworthy and was presented 2 years before Pope Benedict XXVI resignation  the situations recreated in Rome and the Vatican superb
B007STBUIW|5.0|In our lives we come across great books, great films, great plays... Some better than others...  This movie is simply one of the greatest movies ever made, put it on the same shelf as The Godfather and The Godfather II...
0671449028|5.0|This is a thick paged, short book that entertains my grandson and helps him relax and calm down in preparation for bedtime. Reading creates a beautiful nighttime ritual as well as plants the seed in him for reading on his own in the future. There is nothing better than a book in the hands of a child. It is something i encourage.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|You can tell you're being manipulated by straight-up propaganda, right? This movie is meant to stir up American patriotism while at the same time stoking anti-Iran, anti-Arab, anti-Muslim hatred. Apparently, public opinion still matters and must be carefully manipulated through all available means, not least of which is \\"entertainment\\" media. Come on, please don't fall for it and please don't participate in it. Don't fund your own brainwashing by paying to see films like this.<br /><br />I wonder when they will make a blockbuster film about how the CIA overthrew a democratically elected president in Iran (Mosaddegh) in the 1950's and installed their very own brutal dictator, the Shah?
B004QL7K6G|3.0|Every trip starts with a first step, and \\"Wanderlust\\" takes a long stride at the beginning; the opening scene with Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston is pretty funny.  But sometimes, a long hike becomes, well, just a long hike, and it's better to just know when it's time to sit down and take a rest.  I knew that I was ready for one long before the film ended.<br /><br />This film surely was influenced by comedies made by Ben Stiller, where humiliation -- and being able to withstand that humiliation, even as the viewer -- is important.  These films can be really funny, but they can more easily devolve into cringefests.  Now, \\"Wanderlust\\" never quite gets that bad, but it sure acts as if it tries.<br /><br />Typical theme for this type of film:  are people who are involved in communes crazy, or is it more the case that people who engage in \\"normal\\" life really the crazy ones?  It deconstructs human behaviour to try to make that point, but it doesn't exactly work.  (It does have a lot of full male frontal nudity versus the standard female version in most \\"dirty\\" films, perhaps trying to help support that deconstruction.)  However, it still has it's moments, and I got a few good laughs out of it.<br /><br />But even still, I wanted to go 4 here, but I just couldn't.  It was more like a 3 as it loses it's way, never to return, before the third act even begins.
B005IQZB14|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:  Kept waiting for a deeper set of insights... but perhaps that's the whole point?<br />Good, but not great.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is lots of fun. Good for all ages. Makes your mind work but at the same time is exciting.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game is awesome. It makes me happy to play it. I sit there eatin tons of bacon n jus play this game for hours. I mess up all the time when I play, because I get bacon grease all over the screen. But it's ok cuz I love all final fantasy games, this is the real deal...so no matter how much bacon grease I get on the screen, I play it. Then I just lick the screen off and go to sleep. Or drink beer and eat chicken whings. Buy this game now! Or later. I don't care when you buy it, cuz I don't know you. But I bought it, and it's awesome. Goodnight.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|everything  cost too much!!!  Cost too much for expansions can't  earn  enough cash.  Would have one thousand dollars spent on this game if you pay for things with your own money!!!  Don't waste your time
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|The best show on television so far...is funny and very smart...Neil is great on his character  cant wait to see the last season
B007M45PMU|4.0|Pretty good CD, not great but pretty good. Songs 3, 4, 5 & 7 are my favorites. The other songs will grow on you. I like the whole better now after multiple listenings.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Sometimes hard to get everything to open as it should.  Its ok.  I only use it once or twice a week because of that.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a page turner, it was hard to put down as I wanted to keep reading.  It wasn't predictable as to<br /> what was going to happen next.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I need to know what happens next!!!!! Now maybe she will be the one to come to his rescue?  I can't wait to read!!!!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|A great period for the two great ones to meet up. Honor and Homage are the things that come to mind while watching this<br />archival show. Recommended for all who love the Blues.<br />Daddy and his boys finally come home...
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Turns out they are not a One-Hit Wonder. The whole CD is great. The tune are complex but catchy. It's a good idea to listen to the whole CD in one sitting to get the full scope of the music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Riveting show. Probably the best overall show on television at the present. Plot twists, character development, incredible acting, and lots of gore.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This book was positively riveting.I mean, it wasn't an amazing art of literature,but it wad definitely a page turning chick flick.I gave this book 4 stars because I thought the storyline was scary and page turning but  it was really immature literature.I think this book wad made to please the crowd and not the critics.But it was a great story with a stunning cast of well defined characters and a storyline as addicting as a bag of potato chips. I was always on the edge of my seat as I was flipping through the pages of this novel and this was overall very good read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is amazing, and addicting!  You will want to keep watching until the end of the season.  The storyline keeps you interested without seeming over the top or outrageous.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I can't wait to buy the blu-ray dvd of this movie, I was able to watch the movie 3 weeks before the release thanks to xbox live offering it to xbox gold members.  I couldn't wait to the release of the movie I had to watch it and my sons were eager to see it.  I will say that I am not dissapointed, Wreck it Ralph or like my small one likes to call it Wack it Ralph, is amazing.  The animation is top notch and crisp, movement of the characters change depending in which arcade game they find themselves in.  Atari memories returned to me as I watched the movie with the boys and we enjoyed it.  This movie has a lot to offer to all ages, it teaches of the power of friendship, of dreams and achievement.  You can connect with the characters emotionally.  You won't go wrong with this one, its a keeper, and I can't wait for them to make another one focusing on some of the other games in the arcade.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|A surprising CD. The whole is interesting in structure. The tune are complex but catchy. It's a good idea to listen to the whole CD in one sitting to get the full scope of the music. Worth the buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is worth $7. The graphics are outstanding. They look so realistic. The game is totally a time waster, which is good. I love minecraft pocket edition!!!!!
0316223239|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br />Spoilers:<br />I'm a bit speechless...or maybe just whatever would be the perfect word for disturbed and awed. When I first started reading, I was looking for something to settle me in for the night since I was tired! But the narrative pulled me in and I literally couldn't put the book down, making what should have been an early night a very early morning. To begin, the story is told through the point of view of five year old Jack, a little boy born and raised to date in a room that he believes to be real life as its his own reality. The syntax adds to the sense that you are in this child's place. And, if you began this book not knowing anything about it as I did, you're thrown as to why this boy is stuck in this room. Is his mother perverse? Where are they? And then the sick, frightening truth settles in. The young woman known only as Ma was kidnapped at the age of 19, kept as a sex slave for 7 years, and impregnanted twice. Her only solace in the world is the child that survived, her son Jack...and this boy has to be \\"scave\\", meaning scared and brave, as he is the only way they can finally escape, and then he has to be acculturated to the real world. He has to see everything for what it is, to face a new reality...and that's heartbreaking enough...but Ma has to face that the world didn't stop when she was taken, that time marched on, that she too has to try to fit in to the world she so desperately missed.<br />It ends with an end that is a beginning...but the struggles these two characters will face...it's just, simply put, sad.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest series I have watched since 24! I love it and will continue to watch it!
1250006341|5.0|I was pleased with the beautiful Photography and the detailed descriptions of costumes.  It has interesting behind the scenes stories.
0307987698|5.0|My son loves Elmo and Grover, so he is a big fan of these books.  We enjoy reading them together.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|With all the medical information thrown in between the gist of the story, for me it took away from the REAL story!
B0060MYM3S|1.0|I bought Season 2 BluRay DVDs and they would not play on my BlueRay DVD player. I think it's because the DVDs were foreign and are incompatible with ours here in the US.  Fortunately the seller refunded my money and handled the refund quickly.  I noticed that on the bottom of the email from the seller, it looked like Chinese writing.<br />Nothing on Amazon indicated that these were foreign DVDs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app!! its great for young kids who get excited about taking care of a pet!! definitely get this freebie!!!
1932735410|3.0|Content is fine except for the Process Map. I think that is just confusing and it doesn't map to the exam questions well. I could have done without the condescending tone.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|It was as good as the movie.  I recommend it to anyone who likes Les Miserables by Victor Hugo the movie.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is an annoying older and set in his ways rebel.  At the beginning you don't really care who \\"done it\\", but as the book goes on you can see that initial assumptions about the crime were all wrong and it is going to take a rebel to ferret out the truth, no matter who it hurts, Harry included.  A tumultuous ending is in store for those who follow Harry!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Very addicting but can be very frustrating but overall a very fun game. I would suggest this to you also city story
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again Ken Follett has created a marvelously well documented account of a major time in world history. His character development is flawless and anyone who lived through the years this book covers can easily relate to both the happenings and the people involved in these events. Of course Follett is too young to have lived through the time involved but, for those of us old enough to remember them well, he has caught the emotions of the people of the day with great accuracy. The story advances, year by year, through the dramatic and tragic events of that era. We see the brutality of men and the political policies they fought to protect and expand and the devastating effects their actions had on the civilian populations of the many countries involved in that major conflict.<br />  It is impossible to read this history without gaining an appreciation for, and understanding of, the efforts and sufferings of everyday citizens whose major concern was simply trying to keep their families fed and sheltered. Everyone should read about these events and study the circumstances that brought them about because, sadly, history seems to repeat itself when people do not believe these horrors can ever happen again. To not learn from history makes the world a very dangerous place.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend. We enjoyed watching it together. It has a great cast and has some great lines.
B0049VZ222|5.0|After hearing talk about the show I thought I would check it out. Couldn't understand what was going on in current episodes so got the first season...I loved it! I'll be getting the second season soon.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I LUV THE FACT THAT THE FREE VERSION MAKES ME WANT TO  PURCHASE THE FULL VERSION<br />Id recommend this game to anyone who loves these types of games
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We saw this in the theater and in the couple days we have owned it our kids have watched it about 6 times.  So it holds up after many viewings.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|It's a classic, good for all ages, it never gets old. I can watch this all the time, the humor is great
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app is worthless to me. I tried to log in and after 8 characters it freezes up. I uninstalled then reinstalled and got the same result. I permanently uninstalled.<br /><br />Kindle Fire
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome superheros. Great cast. Don't really care for the storyline because I was focused on the action. I was still able to follow, nevertheless. And its in 3D! I'm done here...
B00BESLHEA|1.0|If there were less than one star that is what I would give this movie. I can't believe that Russell Crow would act in this movie.  It was a waste of time and money and I chose to stop the movie about 30 minute in to it. I always give a movie at least that long to redeem itself if the beginning is bad.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|the item was in perfect condition. my husband and i loved the season. however the girls characters are a little more annoying.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A thrilling Nicolas Sparks novel about a young woman leaving her old life behind and starting life anew. Her past life causes her to be cautious in her new relationships. It is a story of courage and trust.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I loved it I couldn't download anything to it nd now I could its great best thing ever... I'm so happy now I can download my pica to this:-)
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This is an unutterably foul, violent, repulsive and superficial movie, not worth the celluloid it was printed on. From the very first few minutes we are treated to the usual gallery of dressed-up horrors including drug use, grotesque and unconvincingly unredeemable characters, and acting (I'm thinking particularly of Dredd) that makes Stallone look like Lawrence Olivier by comparison. It's hard to believe that the actor playing Dredd made it to Hollywood, he is simply terrible, terrible, as is his sidekick the blonde bimbo who just got off the casting couch to mumble her lines about why she doesn't wear a helmet (what, her hair is that important to the film?). The film grinds to an absolute halt within the first twenty minutes as we are treated to stabbing, skin being shorn off with Bowie knives, slow motion falls from high rises, and bloodshed that never ends - ever. Quite obviously you would not show this film to a kid or teenager unless they were already a psychopath or wanted to become one, and it is therefore hard to understand who the potential audience is for this? Adults such as myself? White supremacists? F.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|i forgot how weird this movie is. I bought the product used, everything was good, no scratches, nothing was broken.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It is for all ages; especially younger kids. I love how realistic it is.This is a great app.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I held off reading this for a long time because I thought it might be to uncomfortable for me to read,however, I am now captivated by this love story and can't wait to read the next book in the series
B008EKOO46|5.0|A great look into our recent past and how our society can learnfrom it.  Diamond has an innate sense at looking at cultural history thru a scientist's eyes.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. I read these so fast, which is not normal for me. I 100% recommend to anyone
B006LSZECO|2.0|While this was a page turner and I enjoyed the writing style and changing viewpoint I did not connect with any of the characters.  I would probably give it a 2.5 if that option were available.  The story line was creative and has made me appreciate suspense novels enough to add more to my reading list.  Overall, my distaste for the raw language and unlikable characters prevent me from giving it a better rating.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|This thing has saved me countless replacements on batteries, automatically stops charging once charged, and has no metal contacts (as it uses inductive charging).  It's nice to never have to worry about my Magic Mouse disconnecting due to &#34;low battery.&#34;  If you use an Apple Magic Mouse, BUY THIS!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Very long and drawn out plot line. Could have been shorter. Great ending. Good character development. Classic read, but not worth a re-read.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This movie was more about main characters alcoholism than his heroic flight. Could have just gone to a local AA meeting and heard this story and many others in the same amount of time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a book you can't put down.  It lets you turning the last page and wanting more.  Who needs a movie when the author can paint such vivid scenes with words!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a good book I really liked and enjoyed it-from my 8 year old son .I also enjoyed reading it with him.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|this writer is one of my favorites, and this book is great too- as most of his books are. I will buy more books of this series
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you love historical fiction this book will really pull you in. I haven't read Ken Follet before and now I am hooked. From page 1 he drew me in to the character's lives. The great part is that it bounces between different characters throughout Europe during WWI and you get pulled into how they are affected by the events around them. I was not very knowledgable about WWI before reading this so it has given me a great perspective on the events that unfolded during that time.  I highly recommend it!<br />ps - book 3 of the trilogy is not due out until fall 2014 - that's the only downside!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Does not allow you to go past a certain point in the news feed. Only allows you to see a few posts and then the screen stops. This is for the Kindle Fire.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining but slow moving at times. I enjoy baseball and baseball movies like money ball so if you liked that one you will enjoy this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought in a million years I would like a zombie show.  It keeps my interest and I actually paid to caught up on missed shows.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|I always appreciate when an artist is willing to take the time to remaster their work. Even if Johnny Marr had not this would still be a great buy. I grew up in Seattle, where the Smiths and the guitar of Johnny were, and to this day imitated and loved.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl deserves its great reviews because each new chapter brings another revelation.  The intricate lives both husband and wife lead are believable and fascinating.  An excellent, can't put it down book.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|This movie may not be the best movie ever, but it was refreshing to see an ending that consisted of more than the happy ending (man, wife, and 2.5 kids). It was nice to finally be represented by movie.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Great movie very action packed and exciting. Good actors and plot line. Music was excellent. Followed story line well. Great
B004N66XYE|5.0|I love, love, love this series. It is a remake of the 1970's series but with new characters and a new family. Many historical figures many cameo appearances. Give it a try... you'll be hooked.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I enjoy the stories and the Intrigue that goes with each adventure.  I woud recommend this book for anyone that likes this type of adventure.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|This book shone a wonderful perspective on, as the title says, the 'power' of introversion. This book gave me some profound realisations about myself. It is interesting how, throughout life, you feel the pressure to be extroverted when in fact it is more often introverts who change the world. This book helped me learn to value and cultivate my more introverted side, rather than trying to 'keep up' with the more extroverted people in my life, which means I am able to be and feel more genuinely myself. It was a really interesting read.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Amazon needs to STOP discriminating and offer Close Caption to view the streams. If it is to charge a full DVD price then Amazon should provide proper accommodation to meet the needs of all viewers.<br /><br />Enjoyed the Movie I paid the full price but do not have all the proper support and did not know till I was ready to view.<br /><br />Could have had OnDemand in Comcast but chose to pay to own and got less.
B0041KVXLK|4.0|Oooh, so nice to hear the remastered version on this warm, 180 gram virgin vinyl product from 2012. From the very opening  sounds of the crowd, to that first pound of the kick drum and driving quarter note guitar riff starting off the beginning of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, I have been amazed at how solid and fat the engineers have made this 45 year old recording sound. It literally puts the old original American vinyl version into the \\"almost thin sounding\\" category. Notice, I didn't include the Japanese vinyl pressing. I have both, plus the 1980s and 1990s reprints, and I also have the MFSL 1-100 and MFQR 1-100 heavy weight vinyl versions put out by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, not to mention the U.K. box set version. Gotta tell ya, the MFQR box set highly sought after product is still my favorite for the following reasons: It carries that warm, deep sound like the newest release here, but with the original mix and mastered sound - just on better vinyl and lacking the intense remastering treatment that the 2012 disc has.<br /><br />But that's not all - just as I'm awaiting that crucial piano note lasting almost 45 seconds at the end of side 2 finishing off \\"A Day In The Life\\", it hits! That awesome climax to what many consider The Beatles' best, if not second best song they ever produced finally strikes. BAM! After all the previous 4 minutes of \\"I read the news today, oh boy\\" story telling and now THAT note. A perfect ending to a perfect album on perfect (as advertised on the sticker) 180 gram vinyl and....oh no....no...nooooo! 10 seconds into that piano note hold comes not one, but 3 huge clicks and scratch sounds! Say it ain't so, but it is. I replay it twice, three times, hoping that a piece of rogue dirt or vinyl piece will dislodge and float away on my needle providing me that bliss of the perfect ending to the perfect album...only to have my hopes dashed. That scratch is still there. But the funny thing is, it can't be seen on the disc - even with a microscope. Ah, a pressing smudge.<br /><br />Well, well. Only $25 with minor disappointment. You can't expect perfection like the Japanese get on their pressings. But hey: the trail-off groove with that insane vocalizing is there to listen to without scratches ad nauseum. And at least the nice cover is almost as sturdy as my 1967 Capitol Records copy. Almost.<br /><br />Now for the wait that we all share just to see if we can spend ANOTHER $200-300 on the mono set later this year. I...am...holding....my....breath........(cough!)a microscope.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|You have to be quick to get around the kitchen. Enjoy the different themed restaurants. Addictive game lots of fun
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought this game because of the reviews on metacritic and I was looking for something to play on my Vita. I am extremely glad I did. I think the character development is fantastic and the over all story is very good. I found myself laughing out loud many times at the events that happen in the game and even after I beat it, I went back to work on another play through to see what I missed which is EXTREMELY rare.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Can be very funny<br />Character development between you and the in game characters<br />Interesting story. it kept me wanting t ofind out what happens next.<br /><br />Cons<br />Inventory system could use a little work. (For example I could use a card to give my persona an ability but when you look at the description, it reads, \\"Gives your persona the somethingorother ability\\" It would have been better to say what the ability is without having to \\"menu dive\\".<br /><br />Warning: You will play this for hours and lose track of time just to see what happens next. Don't say I didn't warn you ;)<br /><br />Great Game!
B000URWYTS|4.0|This book was interesting to me as I lived near Spring Green for 30 years and the rumor mill was not always kind to Mr Wright.  I enjoyed the fact Maymah was so ahead of her time but how ahead did she really get????  It was an inspiring but sad book about some very forward thinking, super intelligent and talented folks who made a big difference in many ways.  FLW will never be forgotten for his innovative design talent and his buildings worldwide, I am glad this book was published to honor the role of his mistress as she had alot more to do with his success than most will ever know!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|This app offers so much more than just definitions. The variety of languages allows you to cross reference words quickly. This app is a wonderful resource?!
B00004TDTO|4.0|This edition has a 2 hour \\"making of\\" documentary in addition to a lot of the same features that the 25th anniversary edition has.If you are not interested in that , then I would save your money for the 100th edition( just kidding we are not there yet)
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This is a must have for your movie collection. I really enjoyed the movie. Awesome fighting scenes and great store. Anonomus is back
B008HK3XKO|2.0|I picked this case and the Belkin Glam to test at the same time... I really thought I'd like this one better but it turns out I like the Belkin far more. In the photos this case looks nice, it seems well made and the textured front was appealing, I also really like this style of clasp (nothing to get in the way when it's open).<br /><br />When it arrived however I was very disappointed. The stitching is fine, but it's thin thread and not double stitched. The material feels awful. It's much thinner then the Belkin and seems cheap. The main thing that was a deal breaker for me was the crease from where it bends when open... most cases of this style have some stitched seam details in that area to reinforce and hide the crease when it's closed. This case doesn't, so besides the fact that I think after extended use it will split on the edges, you can also see and feel the indentation when the case is closed. It also doesn't stay open/up as well as others I've tried. Honestly the elastic band closure is the only part of the case I like. I'm sort of shocked at all the great reviews here, personally I think there are better options.
1846467640|5.0|Peppy Pig is always a hit in our family.  Little books are fine for a three year old.  Not really quite mature enough for an older child.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|This  was the first time I rented a movie from Amazon. It was a good not great movie in my humble opinion.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Using this with a mac book air. Plug it in and it is connected. After I get some more performance information (anything that might be out of the normal range) I will come back and update the review. But, as of now, it works.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|A surprisingly good movie. I was unfamiliar with the the plot and it had a good surprise in it. Recommended.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game that keeps me entertained when I am out of town.  Makes you think a bit.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Any course, anywhere on the course, and good battery life.  Have played a dozen times since item arrived, it works flawlessly.
