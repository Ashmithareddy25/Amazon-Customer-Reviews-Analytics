B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like his writing style. The book starts out present day, shifts to the beginning of the story and then back again. He does a very good job keeping you balanced so that he does not give anything away until the end when you are back to where you started but ends with a twist.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love love love this game! Easy way to work your brain and kill some time. Much more engaging than sudoku and wonderful for keeping up on basic math skills
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is an awesome cd, I love every song on it!<br />These guys did a wonderful job<br />doing a tribute to 2 wonderful singer -<br />songwriters. I highly recommend  it to any country music lover ,
B000HKYN74|5.0|enjoyed the season, had a good finish to carry over to the next season.  nothing more to say on this.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This work has a singular combination of darkness and humor. It is a page-turner as well. The author makes some sharp observations about the facts of life. I hope for the sake of the human race that some of his outlook is too pessimistic (as opposed to realistic). I like to think that life is what we make of it, and that it need not be a storm of swords. Perhaps this book will inspire the same hope in other readers.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game can be fun but frustrating. It will freeze up in the middle of the game. Not only do you lose your credits but you lose any winnings you had also. It is impossible to ever complete the bingo 'crown'. An exercise in futility. Also hard to figure out in the beginning as there are no instructions.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This works great on a Kindle Fire.  We could research local restaurants via hotel wifi instead of a laptop - nice.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved the show so when they made the movie I was excited. If you like the show then you'll love the movie.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Loved KITE RUNNER but subsequent books are a rehash of the poverty amidst war. I ditched this book because it was very similar to his earlier stories. Maybe I just know so much more about Afghanistan than I did when I read KITE RUNNER.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a book that helps me to understand myself.  It also helps to explain why so many have such difficulty.
B008M0UTRO|4.0|I enjoy all these films. The art work is incredible. I own most of them, the first films being my favorites.
B0063IH60K|5.0|App works well on Kindle Fire HD. It does what they say it does and I got it for free so you can't beat the price.
B0058VW36U|1.0|How many of your reviews are for real? I downloaded this game and an ad popped up wanting me to buy coins.ugh! Also,read at the bottom of the page.this game wants access to your privacy.networks and that.developer's,you do not need private information from people for your games.what you need to do is rely on real feedback and not anything else.one very good piece of advice is please do not solicit 5 star reviews.that is bad.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Love this album, listen too it, it is important that you do, it could change your appreciation of the world
B007MB5OCE|5.0|amusing story of the life of a 100 year old man and his adventures. all interwoven with famous people and events.  good read.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The book kept me interested but overall just not my type of book. It was kind of predictable and I wasn't very happy with the ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Glad I found this book!  Haven't read any sci fi in years. I was more interested in the self publication aspect of the book, but once I read the sample, I had to finish.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|My favorite CD at the moment. What a voice! Have been listening to this CD for the past week now.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Finding a character with those qualities in today's world seems a fantasy. However, The Good Wife is convincingly real, and it is a pleasure see one who is also a good lawyer and mother too in the complex world of law. In the first season, I found the crimes a little queazy and a little difficult to follow. Even the criminals have an interesting and complex side as the show develops over time. The prosecution becomes every bit as interesting as the defense over time. The characters develop depth all around. The various judges are all fascinating. In these days it is refreshing to see a program that has sympathy for (nearly) all the characters. The guest actors are all good, but I would not hang the success of the show on that. I think Alicia, Diane, and Kalinda are a great collaboration.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this for my grandson (5 yr ) and he is amazing with this.  Makes for good hand and eye coordination.  This is a very rapidly playing game
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|OK, I have to be honest.<br />I have heard John Mayer's songs and music before... Was I paying attention, obviously not as much as most of the other commentary here.  I had heard all the rumors and the crazy love life stories so I wasn't to interested...<br />Then John performed a benefit concert this last winter in Bozeman, Montana to benefit the volunteer firefighters that fought a pretty nasty wildfire in John's neighborhood. (I was one of those firefighters)  I had no idea John had moved to Montana, let alone in our valley, nor did I care. But his human kindness and sensitivity to the folks in our community made me look closer.<br />The first album I purchased was the Born and Raised. I really enjoyed it!  Great music, down to Earth and I really liked the mix. Then when I saw that he was putting out an album called Paradise Valley - I had to get it - That's home!<br />Not only does the cover represent such an awesome place to live.  But it also shows the inspiration he obviously had when he wrote the album.  I love how he has been experimenting with country - Old Country - \\"You're No One'Til Someone Lets You Down\\"  I love this! Then there is \\"Wildfire\\" it has become my summer 2013 theme song! Hanging out on the Yellowstone River! My favorite would have to be \\"Badge and Gun\\" or would it be \\"On the Way Home\\"...humm maybe \\"Dear Marie\\" Not sure I have a favorite.<br />I would have to agree that if you liked Born and Raised, you will like Paradise Valley -
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found the book hard to get into. However once I identified myself with characters I found it easier to read
B009LH1WLO|5.0|I have been watching Supernatural for about 6 years now.  It is always entertaining with some of the best music selection for a show I have ever heard.  Good combination of action, drama, and comedy.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I saw the original Expendables, and I thought this sequel to it was done with as good of its, direction, graphics, Story line and acting, and production as the first and that is unusual for Action movies, usually the sequel looses something.  I believe that keeping most of the same cast members was its major success. It has become one of my favorite movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Me and my family play this game all the time. It has customizable difficulty so your kids can play too. It's fun for the whole family.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I have followed Tom Cruise for many years and films. I do believe this is his best and the cast was well picked and directed.  The Graphics were well done and almost made you feel like you were there.  Thumb up
B005LAII80|5.0|This is based on the comics and gives a really fresh twist to the series.  The classic was it's own movie, this is all new.  The judges, the criminals, the whole concept of mega-city one is alive in this movie and it provides for a truly entertaining glimpse into the world of Dredd.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy action and tough-guy movies!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The third season was great. Great character development and story line. Waiting for season 4 to become available on Amazon now.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Seriously, you can leave this in your cd player for weeks at a time.  Super fantastic hits that will have you singing along and feeling acca awesome in no time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Kids absolutely love it a nd as so do we. Can play fir awhile or a little bit. Always fun.
B00942YBQ4|5.0|Channing Tatum + Romance = Perfection. Great story and it isn't what you would expect. Love the movie! 5 Stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm officially addicted.  I play every night & I'm 34 years old. Love the challenges. & missions.  Keeps it interesting & fun.will keep playing
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey has a unique voice and an incredible attention to detail that makes his characters truly come to life. Early on in the book, you will feel what the characters feel, see what they see, and experience the hopelessness of life inside the silo, and the fear and wonder of the outside.<br /><br />This book will surprise you with insightful pearls of wisdom speckled throughout that you will want to write down, think over and cherish.<br /><br />If you are interested in a post-apocalyptic setting that explores the best and worst of humanity, you will enjoy this book. It will keep you guessing and will keep you up late at night as you read just one more chapter, and then another and another just to see what happens next.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Mr. Luttrell writes a good account of the extreme conditioning, mental and physical, required of the brave men and women who desire to become Navy SEALs. If he had omitted the liberal-bashing political views that were unnecessary and, at times, clearly unfair and off target, I would rate his book with 5 stars. This is a gripping read and a testament to the bravery and dedication of those that serve our country proudly as SEALs. There was  no need to inject highly inflammatory rants against his fellow Americans that have a liberal or progressive point of view, politically. It added nothing and distracted this reader from the excellent account of his training and heroic service.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The character was found reading and movie was very attractive; but for the actor...BUT he played a good role and I found this film very enjoyable.....and look forward to watching it again..  Appreciated the opportunity to buy at such a good price... Thank you
B00C3MK9ZO|5.0|Leprous does it again with this absolutely outstanding release.  This is the best band you have probably never heard of.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a quick, easy summer read with twists and turns, laughter and sorrow.....a good traveling book that doesn't require much thought, but allows you to drift through the story as it happens.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Interesting tale of a troubled American family with a few twists and turns, slow beginning but quickly became hard to put down.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|First thing to say, I am a superman fan. I saw this movie at theaters and was impressed by the action and special effetcs. However, the plot could (and should) have been better. Ok, that is a super-hero movie, but they could have made it more credible.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I can't stop watching it!! It keeps you coming back for the next episode. I've spent 2 weekends glued to his series .
B00957T6X6|5.0|The books are always better. Joffrey is more evil, Cersei is more crazy, Tyrion is more interesting, Arya is braver, stronger and smarter, Jaime is more conflicted and Dany is more of everything.
1452113432|4.0|The pictures. The recipes .. The stories behind each dish .. a lovely one.. but yet I wished it had a French's pastries recipes like croissant and baguette ..
B002UD56I6|3.0|I think they were just trying to recoup some expenses for all the upfront work, which couldn't be completed due to Michael's death. But seeing how things happen back stage prior to a show actually happening, was pretty cool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love every minute watching this series and can't wait for the new season. A must see show. Great acting.
B000XSWVEC|4.0|This is also what it's really like when you inter college and try out for the band and Fraternities as well. The showmanship, music, songs and drum work was EXCELLENT!!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I purchased this collection for my son who had never seen the trilogy.  He loves it product quality was perfect.  Was sold as &#34;like new&#34;.  And it was.  Thank You!
B00EOO55GW|4.0|I honestly loved their self titled album. I also have a lot of positive things to say about \\"Nightmare\\". I think this album has it's high points and low points, and at first listen, I did not like it. It took me a couple of listens to really warm up to the album mostly because I was really excited about a new A7X album and had incredibly high hopes for a bat crap nuts album. \\"Crimson Day\\" and \\"Doing Time\\" have to be my favorites. I can honestly say I do not like \\"Hail to the King\\". I was incredibly upset that this was the song they named the album after and chose to release first. \\"Heretic\\" reminds me of \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" within the first 30 seconds. \\"This Means War\\" obviously sounds like \\"Sad but True\\", but it isn't necessarily terrible. Most people are going to hate this because it isn't as crazy as their previous albums, but I like it. It's already on my playlists.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Fast moving and full of action.  I like this type of action movie and this one fit the bill
B00BHMEALA|1.0|Don't ever buy any movie from amazon it is the absolute worst thing to do .. I recommend never order a movie .. But this movie was good..
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and provocative.  The ending was perfect especially deciding which of the stories you want to believe.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|excellent, creepy show. worth watching.  not for the faint of heart or those who dislike gore and blood.  watch it.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|Most enjoyable plot and story. I really enjoyed it as a SiFi movie.  It is a love story of course but in a sifi setting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have read several book along the same theme.  This is one of the better ones.  It is more understanding of the varied viewpoints on many of the subjects, and discusses them carefully and without condemnation.
B005LAII80|4.0|This is a another sufi action movie.  I've seen the theme of this type movie before but still enjoyed it.
B0081336FO|5.0|The BBC Sherlock series is terrific...smart, funny, and a thoroughly entertaining and authentic update to classic Sherlock Holmes tales. The placement in the contemporary begs the comparison the other recent update &#34;Elementary&#34;. The similarities end there. Sherlock has very different look, feel and pacing than the American product. I think there are things to enjoy about Elementary, but Sherlock is immeasurably more &#34;authentic&#34;. The two leads - Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman (see Office and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) are fantastic! It's a must see.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Loved the movie! It was a fun ride! Rediculosly hilarious! Great entertainment for an evening with friends when you want a flick with action and laugh out loud comedy!!
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|Grandsons are 5 and 7.  When I \\"sampled\\" this book for my Kindle, I did not hesitate to download it.  Five year old grandson will surely enjoy this as he does not stay in the lines...you will understand when you take a look at this perfect book for children who color inside the lines and why \\"certain\\" colors are happy and others asking for a change :)....Take a peek.  I bet you will enjoy this charming story.  I did! Maureen
B003CYKCHW|5.0|This mouse was literally the laughing stock of my gaming friends, it was big and bulky and a little ugly. Though it is like that, it still was a really good mouse. I bought this mouse because I needed a gaming mouse and at the same time I looked at it and said to myself, I wonder what my friends would say if they saw this. It lasted for about 8 months before I had to replace it because while at a friends house soda was spilled on it and it stopped working. The mouse has nice DPI and the settings are adjustable so you can lower or raise them as needed. Myself loving high sensitivity mouses, still took a little while to get used to the highest setting. While it's big and bulky looking it works great, I'm not kidding on the big part. I have massive hands so it was fine for me but my friends had trouble using it because it was so clunky feeling. Over all I recommend this mouse for people who are wondering if it's really any good, this mouse looks incredibly ridiculous but it is better than you expect.
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|Pretty decent flick. I think if I watch it again and pay better attention ill like it more. It is def a thinking persons movie.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Great concert! A must for any Dio/Black Sabbath fan. Ronnie James Dio will never die! Long live Ronnie James Dio!
B000WC3AJE|5.0|this film showed the great musicals that mgm had done over in the 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960. it was very good film from days gone bye.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Emmy has such a beautiful voice. We loved all the songs. Took me back to the years growing up when my Mom would sing along with the radio...
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Have been playing game for couple of weeks now and find the graphics are really good and enjoy trying to solve the puzzles. Very good product would recommend to those who like jigsaw type puzzles.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So far it has been fun. I don't like that it offers for free just to turn around and make you have to pay to continue.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love all these games. Different challenges and harder each time. But something even kids could do. But do wish you did not have to say so muck each time you want to leave a review
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love this app. now I can use my kindle to take notes in class and can send to my wireless printer (once I figure it out).
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|it was great and im buying it when it comes out on dvd for my collection no matter what  sweat!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Not just for artists but for everyone, great and a very inspirational book that changed my attitude on how I proceed with my creative process.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This is in my collection of regular stand-bys that I rotate when I'm in the mood for a rom-com, and I've yet to tire of it. There are heroes and villains, you'll cheer for some and feel sorry for others - it's a lovely movie about crushes, love lost and found, and being open to new experiences.
1607066017|5.0|I own most of the comics and now get them every month, but this is a great introduction as you can read all of the first 5 at once. What a story! And the visuals! Everything is great- a space opera not unlike Firefly. Only problem is that each chapter ends a bit too soon... as is the case with the individual comics. Probably one of the most unique comic stories to come out in a while.
B004YCKJSS|2.0|For almost 2 hours, this movie drones on and on about what seems to be mostly a bunch of men who refuse to grow up and the sad, pathetic women trailing behind them hoping to pick up the crumbs of whatever attention may be left after they've consumed their fill in porn. Annabeth Gish is repeatedly described as \\"meh\\" in the looks department by none other than Timothy Hutton, who - let's face it - wasn't exactly first in line when they handed out good looks and can't decide whether to commit to Annabeth Gish (his successful lawyer gf who also cooks!) and the 13 year-old neighbor girl, played by Natalie Portman. Mira Sorvino delivers a predictably half-baked performance as the, snif snif, doormat to Matt Dillon's pound-some-other-guy's-wife jerk who wrestles with the demons of not living up to his own expectations.<br /><br />Basically, this is a movie about what happens when you grow up in a small town where nothing ever changes and where, even when people get older, some people never ACTUALLY leave high school from a mental perspective.<br /><br />I don't understand the point or appeal of this movie. Even if you want to think of or approach it from a \\"coming of age\\" point of view, it falls flat for me. Trite, boring and, at best, makes you glad you didn't grow up in wherever this is supposed to have taken place at.
B0064W65SO|5.0|Freaking awesome. One of Batman's origin stories, and when read in conjunction with Miller's other work, truly a great work about the Dark Knight.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This has been one of my absolutely favorite movies since I watched it when it was first released. In my opinion, this is one of the finest romantic comedies made in the last couple of decades - pairing hilariously awkward moments with the kind of sensitivity that will make you wish it was longer. Jack Nicholson - undoubtedly one of the best and most versatile actors anyway - delivers a stellar performance alongside Diane Keaton who gives yet another performance as a slightly crazy but loveable woman.<br /><br />My favorite part about this movie is not just the fact that it has a happy ending - but rather that it runs the gamut of stereotypes and prejudices against older women while keeping an underlying thread that \\"you're never too old to fall in love\\".<br /><br />An absolute gem!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|The seasons just keep getting better. The stories and companions for this season were just so fun. The weiting is some of the best and I like any episode with the weeping angels.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Worked fine the 1st 2 days with my Sony Bravia tv and streaming off my Samsung S3. After that, couldn't make connection with tv. Had to unplug and then replug a few times before it finally worked. Took me 10 minutes. The next time, same thing but it took longer to connect. The 3rd time it didn't connect and I lost patience. Had to reset chromecast to factor settings. Its worked once before same thing starting happening again. Not what I expected. I sent 2 Feedback forms to Google with no response so far.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This season did not disappoint! It was full of twists & turns, ups & downs; and that ending....wow! Next season is going to get interesting & I can't wait to start watching it.
140006922X|5.0|My good friend, a person involved in weekly Bible study, asked me, \\"Why should I read a book about Jesus written by a Muslim?\\"  There are those like my friend who will not be interested in this book for that reason alone.  Too bad.  I'm neither a scholar nor am I religious.  I was reared Lutheran but dropped out decades ago.  I have read the Bible all the way through a couple of decades ago (while stuck at sea for three weeks on Ocean Station Bravo) but have, of course, forgotten what it said.  This book came as a revelation to me.  As soon as I was barely into it I had an old dusty Bible at my side checking up on the author's surprising quotations.  If you're a lapsed Christian like me, please read this book.  On the other hand, if you're in Bible-study class weekly, devoted to your beliefs yet not afraid to open your mind, please read this book.  The voluminous notes at the end are also worth a look.
B00EOGZ42U|5.0|This is an amazing game where you have to grow your colony of little winged aliens known as growers. Wasn't sure if I should buy the first time I saw it, but I did and I have to say, it's B055. You can fight other colonies for control over that lot of land. It's just the best game ever. You should buy it
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|lol well he is.  Anyway it is so far fetched its very entertaining to watch.  I enjoy this show very much for how crazy it really is.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Watch this one every Christmas season  It is a wonderful family movie. Yes, as a few others have said - not much of a plot.  But, did it really need a deep story line? It's a warm and gentle holiday movie that will put a smile on your face.  And maybe, just maybe make you believe like a child again.
B00422LESO|4.0|Really good.  I personally felt the ending was forced & kinda lame.  I actually hope they change it for the movie.  The main character isn't that great, but I mainly enjoyed the premise.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|One, if not the best games out here. It has no difficulty but the coins are few and far between so you need to use them wisely.
140006922X|4.0|I am not writing this review to trash the author but to point out that, by his own admission, he WAS some kind of Christian convert who saw the errors in that faith and reverted back to the faith of his fathers, Islam.<br /><br />Having already decided that Christianity was not a TRUE faith he writes a biography about it's founder - not exactly a neutral POV. So one must read this biography with an open mind but know that his suppositions might be biased and when you write about the historical Jesus you are going to make a lot of suppositions.<br /><br />I am Catholic so we view the bible quite differently than our Christian brothers. We don't believe in a literal bible. We do believe in a God inspired scripture and Dr. Aslan makes the point that the New Testament is exactly that (written by the faithful for the faithful).<br /><br />I did read this book. I also went to the passages he quotes in the New Testament to get a better understanding of his point of view. This is where I felt the most bias. He infers a tone that may or may not be there. You decide. As a biblical scholar, I'm sure Dr. Aslan would tell you to do so.<br /><br />As others have already said this book is well researched, it would take you years just to read his research materials. So if you have questions about the origins of Christianity this might be the shortcut to some answers. If you want some answers about the Jesus the Man than this is just another book filled with educated guesses, some of which might be thought provoking for the reader.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|All I can say is hats off to the person/persons who created this game. It makes you think as well as use logic to figure out things which I find enlightening for a video game.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great album he loved it it was a great birthday present for him. And he loved to videos that came with it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|One of the best apps available. My hats off to you with this one. It is extremely easy to download as well as enjoyable going through.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I have seen all the die hard movies and i felt this one was missing something.  Bruce Willis seemed tired and the special affects, although always hard to believe in these movies, was over the top.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was extremely short and left much out that I felt was important and should have been included to tell a more complete story.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|All the actors in this movie did an outstanding job. it was entertaining and touching. its nice the see a feel good movie for once.
B000002TQB|5.0|Parklife is normally treated as Blur's masterpiece, and the reason is pretty clear to me. The band reaches its maturity through a variety of tunes and british anthems, in a mix of Graham's psychedelic guitars and Damon's lyrics; the result is incredible. This isn't my favourite Blur album, but I see it as one of their most complete works.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Well, I say hands down, but really it's hands on! I love the functionality of having to perform math to dismiss or snooze.<br /><br />Of course there is always room for improvement but even as is, it's an amazing app.
0735619670|5.0|It's a textbook recommend by the teacher. It's easy to understand, compared to other computer science textbook.<br />PS: Two-day shipping is really on time!
B006Y9BULE|5.0|I love this watch. I've had a couple of other Seiko watches over the years and they hold up well to my continued abuse. I have a relatively small wrist so the watch is kind of on the big side. Maybe a little heavy to. Super easy to operate and set.Still a very beautiful looking watch.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Harvey Brooks (Born Harvey Goldstein) on bass deserves equal mention with Kooper and Bloomfield. Highway 61 Revisited and Electric Flag are the man's credentials at the time of this recording. Stephan Stills heard the Fast Eddie Hoh was playing drums, \\"he's an old friend of mine.\\"
0141439513|5.0|I glad to finally replace my Pride and Prejudice (Penguin Classics) book I had an odd ball co-worker who actually borrowed my book and never returned it. As a female fan of Jane Austin its a must have ,,... to keep in you're collection ..
1400031001|5.0|Any Human Heart truly had me traveling through history, through human nature, through spiritual and emotional landscapes. It is beautifully written, a real page turner and informative as well. I was already familiar with the author's work, but this book is, in my opinion, his best!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote allow me to take photos with my smartphone and have them automatically transferred to my other devices.  It eliminate the hassle of downloading thru a USB.
B00DYESRZY|5.0|Just downloaded this, and am loving it. Street Horsing made me a little crazy, and I liked it but just couldn't get into it as it got me too riled up and wanting to break things. This one has a great feel to it so far. Think Vangelis, then throw in some Killing Joke, maybe some VNV Nation with some Mike Oldfield. I'm going to have to listen to this a lot.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|If you like building games and pirates, you can't go wrong with this! It's fun, challenging and you gotta love those little playmobil figures running around doing silly pirate stuff :)
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is one of the best albums i've heard in years. I can't believe i just now bought this. Awesome.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I love GI Joe movies and this one was the best of them<br />Action from start to end<br />Would recommendthis moviey
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Lead is great.  Fun popcorn series.  Some wild twists and turns but doesn't take itself too seriously.  Worth watching.  Done.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|This story had me from the first few pages.  I knew there was a sub plot but couldn't quite figure it out.  Really enjoyed this and look forward to reading more John Grisham
076115678X|5.0|Yes! I love this book! I have always wanted wavy/curly hair. Of course, my hair has been straight, or at least seemed that way, and I spent lots of years getting damaging perms. I quit putting chemicals on my hair about 5 years ago and eventually saw the curly girl method discussed on a hair forum. I ignored it at first because I didn't think it would be applicable to me, but then my silvers started showing up and I started getting waves and whorls and little curlies, which I wanted to encourage. So, I wanted to check it out. I did find out that just getting rid of silicones made my hair much fuller and wavier. I used the suggestions in the book and now I am so happy with these amazing waves and actual curls that are in my hair now and I didn't have to sleep with curlers or put chemicals on my hair to get them. Just following the directions in this book, I am loving my hair so much. It is the hair I have always wanted and it was right here on my head the whole time. Thank you!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I picked up this series, because I was desperate for something to read I really love this series, i am hooked !!!!!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|I went to the concert and have been waiting a long time for this to come out.  Not disappointed.  Awesome!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book based on the recommendation from a friend and also because I wanted to read it before the movie came out.  You can read the description of the book in the plot summary, so I am going to try not to give anything away.<br /><br />I was disturbed by the amount of bullying that happens to Ender and this is the part I identified with most, being bullied myself in school.  I understood why he was picked on, since he was a \\"third,\\" which is a anamoly in a society where parents aren't allowed to have more than two children.  The part that bothers me the most are not the parts where Ender fights back in the book but why he is picked on so much.  It becomes clearer later in the book but this is one of the things that I can't decide if I liked since it fit into the story, or if I hated because it affected Ender so much psychologically.<br /><br />One of the things I really like about this book, and I think it was mentioned in another review, is the technology that the society uses in the books like the desks Ender and his classmates use and the nets that stories or newsarticles are posted on.  Since this book was written in the 80s, it's cool to see that stuff described before we had things like tablets or the internet.  I also like the battle room, sometimes it was hard to picture it though because they would put things to represent \\"stars\\" in there but you didn't really have a good picture of what they looked like.<br /><br />Overall, this book made me think a lot about not only the effects of pushing a young child too hard to be great, but also about how our society treats people compared to the one in the book.  I think a good book makes you think about your pre-conceived notions about how life is and how it could be very different.  That's one of the things I love the most about sci-fi or fantasy books, is the ability to escape into the world created by the author and be there right next to the main character, cheering them on.  I felt like that with thisbook and it was hard to put down.  The only gripe I really have is that the book should have ended after the big shocker at the end, it goes on for a little while when you think it should be over.  Other than that, it was a great read!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Not only are James Rollins books well-written, the subject is always well-researched and timely. One of my favorite authors. I recommend it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is the best new animation out there. It has both some standard and some unexpected situations leading to a very interesting and entertaining movie. Looking forward to Despicable Me 2.
0517548232|5.0|It provided a framework for understanding the broad picture of incentives and how incentives affect public policy.  It gives great examples of how feel good economics usually ends with the opposite effect once implemented.  Great intro to Austrian school.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Had to delete Android Kindle version. The other player's guess of my drawing never dhowed up nor their drawing for me.  I will play on iPhone
B000EXZI1Y|5.0|I love their last album. this is hard to find music.the last time of the three brothers together,it came fast.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I am reading the jack reacher's in series and this the best too date.  Obviously I am enjoying the writing and am entertained ,but In this style the reader may need to suspend disbelief  from time to time.  This is the first of the series that hangs together for me in a way that is plausible.  Maybe I am just falling under the spell?
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|this is the last concert of the 3 beegee brothers together in lasvegas. it was by far one of their best concerts ever.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is by far my favorite book in the series. i hate that it is the ending of the tale though. I love to read and YA usually isnt my regular genre but i read these a few years ago and wanted to see if I would love them just as much now - i did. by far the beast books to lose yourself in.
B00915G6YE|5.0|excellant
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You should try it. Only bad thing g so far is I thought I'd be taking full care of the horse. N u don't get to pick your hourse I recommend it for young girls. It's fine. the graphics are really nice.
B005PK553C|5.0|I had just finished watching Season 2 and had to feed my new addiction to this series.  I started watching Season 1 yesterday and I am already hooked.  Jessica Lange has long been a favorite of mine, and she does not disappoint - in fact, all of the &#34;regulars&#34; in this series are extremely good,  The story lines can be confusing if you don't pay close attention, but I think that's part of the attraction for me.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|It is very hard for me to review a Bowie album because he was my original music mentor.  I fell in love with Space Oddity the minute I heard it in the early 70's, although I never knew it was by David Bowie until after I heard Ziggy Stardust.  In late 1972 a friend loaned me his Ziggy lp and I ended up having to buy another copy for him and another copy for myself because I wore it out... :)<br /><br />He has produced several albums that changed the course of music, his concert tours in the 70's redefined rock showmanship, his early videos for MTV set the standard for quality music videos and he is still creative and original after 50 years in the industry.<br /><br />This album requires several listens...the music and arrangements are more complex and intricate than what comes across on a first listen...and the melodies and hooks reveal themselves as you become more familiar with the music.  Another excellent addition to my Bowie collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this app a lot!  But I want them to add tender men and wolves! Then it would be perfect!!!
B00CMAK34O|5.0|This album is beautifully written, sung and recorded.  All ABBA fans will be sure to enjoy it and anyone who enjoys sophisticated, melodic songs artfully interpreted will enjoy this album from beginning to end!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|This is a movie in the old style with romance, adventure and all around good times.  Well done with no pornography or vulgar language.  Well worth watching.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|I have every album PSB have recorded, because whether the album is more upbeat or more introspective, it is the the quality of the melodies, the lyrics and the production that ensures the purchase will be worthwhile.  This release sounds completely PSB while being both nostalgic and futuristic in sound at the same time...
B00CATONCA|5.0|this is the best quality i´ve ever seen in an especial edition, all the details 100 % and a lot of zombies
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is awesome! It really helped me clean up my Kindle Fire HD. It showed a bunch of stuff that I didn't even know I had, and that was using much needed space! Would recommend this app to anyone!
B006LA6IW2|3.0|If you believe it, is interesting hearing it from a real sniper. I can tell there are some inserted lines and corny stuff but the main content seems his story.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I'm mesmerized by the tales of Mickey Haller that Michael Connelly writes of.  I can't get enough of Mickey's unusual successes.<br />Couldn't put the book down once I started reading it ... but that's true of all of Connelly's books about Halley.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have all the minecraft versions and i think that this is AMAZING!!! :D I REALLY recomend this if you don't have an xbox or your computer doesn't work with that version. I also love the fact that you can log into your account on this! ;D
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart and quick, really great entertainment all around. Perfect casting, excellent acting and deep meaning. Do not miss this show!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love it and definatly worth it! if u love dragons or not i REALLY recomend it. you never know if your neighbor on this game could live in you neighborhood! ;D
B00CFA227C|5.0|The movie was adventurous and enjoyable. Never saw Jack and the beanstalk in such detail:) would recommend to everyone, buy it!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|What a great movie with no racial boundaries just love and a willing spirit to help someone in need!<br />Outstanding movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|we love the show and can't wait for the next episode!! Both my husband and I watch and we have given the suggestion to all of our friends to watch also.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is very good with excellent actors.  The action is fast-paced and several story lines going on at the same time.  We enjoy the wit of some of the characers and the peak at society in England at that time in history.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|. Worst movie I have ever watched. For such good actor they were awful and third rate!  Never buy it. I wish I could return it!
B0034DGPEU|1.0|Disappointing novel. I can't believe this book is popular AND considered literary fiction. And I can't believe that people are saying that they learned what it was like to be a slave from this book. Where were you during your middle school/high school social studies and history classes?!<br /><br />Could not get behind the main characters, not a one. Another Mary Sue and her abuser story.<br /><br />There is no character arc, the writing is just ok until the last 30 pages when it gets dreadful. There is little to no plot; it's one of those family novels containing an unfortunate smorgasbord of fast paced events to move the story along instead of an actual plot. Events ranged from rape, pedophilia, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, more rape, adultery,  murder,torture, physical and emotional abuse, mental illness.... too much disfunction!<br /><br />Although the book takes place during the late 1700s and early 1800s Virginia, there are only the barest of historical facts/descriptions to let you know when and where you are.......disappointing!<br /><br />This book was an unpleasant read. I did not gain anything from reading it, other than nightmares.... made me feel anxious rather than relaxed. And I don't like to spend good money on something that irritates and leaves me tense.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book. To anyone.<br /><br />I would instead recommend for this time period books that are literary and raise the bar-- Toni Morrison's Beloved or Alex Haley's Roots.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I thought this would be fun but when we (my nephew and I) couldn't figure out the 6th floor we gave up.  There should be hints to follow when that happens.  Poor kids they like finding things but this was too hard
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|I like the Tedeschi Trucks Band (TTB), I like Susan Tedeschi's solo work, and I like the Derek Trucks Band (DTB). That said, for the third time TTB has left me wanting. What do I want? Three things. I want to be musically expanded in the way the DTB did with its inventive and seamless blending of blues, rock, soul, eastern music, jazz, and Latin music. And I want to hear Derek Trucks guitar much more as an equal partner to Susan Tedeschi's voice, as was the case with the balance between Trucks and Mattison on the DTB albums. And I want to hear more Mike Mattison singing (he can go places Susan Tedeschi can't, and vice versa).<br /><br />I once told a friend Revelator was the second best Susan Tedeschi album. I now feel that Made Up My Mind is the second best Susan Tedeschi album and Revelator is the third. If I used the same measuring method, but compared TTB albums to DTB albums instead of TTB albums to Tedeschi albums, of the 10 albums made with Derek Trucks name on cover (between DTB and TTB), Made Up My Mind is 9th, Everybody's Talking is 8th, and Revelator is 10th. He's just too good of a musician to be taking such a small percentage of the \\"front\\" time and to be limiting himself to the smaller musical world of just rock, blues, and soul.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Outstanding well produced and acted series. I love the reboot. The best TV on the telly. Just wish it were all real.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|A science fiction and fantasy folk song (usually spelled 'filk') called the Avengers March of Cambreadth lead me to wanting to buy this, as well as my enjoyment of it in the theater. It was swell, and the fik remix on you tube does act like a trailer -- some things are rearranged<br />[...]<br />It got me to buy this DVD<br />.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I really liked the movie. Excellent story line and the characters seemed real The acting is great. Highly recommend it.
B002436WFI|5.0|This was wonderful, It is a faithful adaption of Sir Terry's work. It is done using real actors not cartoons.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I have a Nikon D5100 camera that fits like a glove in this case. Whether its a short lense or long lense kimd of day, it fits inside perfectly. The only complaint i have is i wish the strap adjusted out to being a little longer.
B00CB3QTR2|5.0|Entertaining movie with a lot of kung fu, and the story is quite interesting. However, Ip Man was a better movie.
0393327655|4.0|Interesting book but somehow in the end very repetitive. All religions are not except able for a critical thinking individual.<br />This book concentrate too much on Islam.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Classic Ken Follett - truly gives you a feel for what it was really like to live during that period.  Great characters and great stories.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|Great concept of having 3 different sizes tips I find it very helpful especially with my drawing apps. The cost is a bonus!!!<br />I gave this stylus 3 stars because the cap continuallys to fall off. I prefer a long stylus which is why I was excited to purchase this item. But now I find myself using a short stylus & keeping track of a cap. :/
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book, it's kind of creepy as it mirrors my life a bit. I'm pissed at the main character Ana. She has no idea she has the best thing in the world. I'm actually envious. Stupid girl.
B00181MHQU|5.0|Its worth watching this movie. The songs, music ,choreography are just awesome. The songs rightly fit into the script. Ballet dance is inspiring !!!
B002RXZF6C|5.0|This movie is unsurpassed by any other movie of its time and the present. The HD experience has really taken it to another viewing level and was like a new movie feeling for the first time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It makes me want to scream at times because I can't figure it out, but other than that, it's a pretty good game
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|This movie was annoying and had entirely too much singing. 10 more words are required to submit this feedback feedback.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie kept my attention the whole time!! Lots of action!! I would recommend this to anyone, even those who are not comic fans!!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Awesome performance by Denzel Washington.  He should have won the Oscar for it.  Great cast, screenplay, and the plane crash scene was incredible.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Everything you loved about 70's and 80's  music.  Not just the artists, but the sound!!  Watch the Documentary about it too and you will like it even more.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Excellent album<br />WD is a superband<br />Don't have much to say<br />It's Billie Sheehan, Mike Portnoy , best bassist and drummer. There is no error.<br />The band sounds really good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome that I play almost all night!<br />What I like the most is playing in different city's.[[ASIN:B004FRX0MY Amazon MP3]]
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was very good.  I loved the characters.  I could just visualize them.  Thought the ending was beautiful.  Can't wait to read more Jojo Moyes books.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|A very good, well grounded sci-fi read.  More of what I would consider classic sci-fi rather than sci-fantasy.  Worth the time to read!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Our kindle case cover has worked quite well. We've had it for months and it has held up quite nice even with our toddler playing the kindle often!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great show to experience the best recoded music in US History!  Offers personal glimpses into the creative process of some pretty great musicians!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is great game. It is very addictive. I play this game all the time. It is worth every penny.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like this game. Both my grandkids and I can play it, there is no pressure to level up by depending upon others. And I love that you can play without an internet connection...anywhere. Great job.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These are great factory replacement eartips for the voyager at a good price and shipped very quickly.  I strongly recommend these to anyone for their Plantronics Bluetooth.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Do not get this app DO NOT GET I REPEAT DO NOT GET IT it is not good to hard to boring
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg wow I'm wowed wow this is just.... wow. I have no other words. just WOWWWWWW wow. Wow I say wow a lot. wow.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Lots of stars. Way over the top. Stars showing up in the movie for no reason. I could have wrote the script for this movie. It seems they wrote the movie to fit all the stars in.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Fun for a while, but the machine guns and explosions tend to get old in a hurry.  Adolescentguys and avid game players will love it, though.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Surprised how bright these are.  I brought them specifically for their long life as the location I need them for is very difficult to change the bulb.  Hopefully these will last longer than me so I'll never have to replace them again :)
0345308239|5.0|I was happy to have another perspective on the pre-post Reformation papacy's occupants and their activities and lacks thereof.  But leaving the impression that the failures were mainly due to these popes tends to underplay the many other problems of The (Catholic) Church from 1300 on (if not 1200), including earlier major heresies (Waldensians, Cathars), the sometimes very nasty work of the inquisition, politicization of crusades, the \\"Babylonian captivity\\" (in Avignon) for about 70 years, the great schism, prior attempts/failures to control the Papal States by papal legates with mercenary armies, the Bohemian deviation (and their defeat of several crusades against their \\"heresy\\"), and the long-term threat of the printing press when the official doctrine of The Church is to not have the bible available to read in the vernacular.<br /><br />The section on the War on Vietnam was also a welcome review of that \\"folly.\\"  But I do think that \\"folly\\" as a descriptor falls short of the mark.
B0088W7VNG|4.0|I was confused on a couple of episodes until I seen how they fit into the story. Great ending to the series.
B001ISMH90|5.0|My br4other gave me a copy of this book years ago, don't know what became of it, must have loaned it and it WAS NOT returned but thought I would like to read it again
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am really enjoying this  majong game. I think it challenges your memory and coordination at the same time, which is especially good for senior citizens.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calc app is large enough, it has all of the basic functions I need, and Ii use it a lot.<br /><br />I was exactly what I was looking for.
0385338724|4.0|This was a story about Lexi, a 28 year old, who wakes up in a hospital bed days after being in a car accident. She doesn't remember anything about the last 3 years of her life. She went from her \\"old\\" self to this \\"new\\" person that she doesn't quite believe is her. She struggles to remember. She tries to find her way back to herself with the help of a few friends, her mom, her sister, and the husband she doesn't remember. It is a nice, fun read, and I need to check out other books by this author.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I'm sorry, this was the worse movie of tom cruise I've ever seen, the futiristic movie is not to enjoyable to watch with him.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was assigned this book for a book club, so I didn't know much about it before buying. I had to warm up to several parts before I could really get into The Book Thief.  First of all, the story is narrated by Death, which provides an interesting perspective.  Also, the way Mama speaks to Liesel (and everyone else) is a bit jarring, but eventually, it becomes endearing. The character development is outstanding and really encourages the reader to understand the motivation of each of the extremely different characters.  We also see how the characters grow and change as they face new experiences.  Yes, there are many sad and distressing parts, but the setting is Germany during WWII, and that setting is far more than just a backdrop.<br /><br />A great read for anyone, even if it is marketed as 'teen fiction.'
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This sucks don't get it! It doesn't work at all like YouTube. Don't ever even consider getting this app. Thankyou
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great family fare, interesting enough for adults and a new take on an old fairytale for the kids. Unless the kids really love it rent don't buy.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I have been an avid fan of this show since it began. This second season DVD set was fantastic. In fact I'm using your Trade-in program to get a $14.50 credit so I can purchase the Third Season Series DVD set. As soon as I get my credit posted I will make my purchase.  Since I no longer have HBO on DIRECTV, this method of seeing this show is a great system. I can watch the shows on my schedule.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this bingo game. My favorite in fact. Ok having said that, I do not like the new power up system. Less bang for the bucks. Way fewer wins.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|one of the best Bond files, lot of action and a good story line. supporting cast was very good. very good.
B00821OX98|3.0|If you are being hunted by aliens who are bigger, faster and stronger than you, you don't just stand there and decide to have a discussion or some sort of drama while you are out in the open with not in a more protected area.  You keep quite and you move stealthily.  Also, too much drama on the father (Tom) with his boys!  Seriously!  While I like the casting and the characters, it is way too much on the drama/conversations during the most inappropriate times.  And, btw, put people and kids to work!  If this was a survival situation, sitting around and acting board is probably not one of the choices!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Very pour movie, very long boring movie.The story made little or no scents. After watching the movie for a few hours, you ask your self why did I watch this.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I really enjoy this game.  Unlike mmany of the other simulation games out there, I have<br />trouble loading it occasionally which is its only drawback for me.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Well done movie. Tom Cruse for a little guy,plays the part of a big bad guy real well. the cast that a very good job.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|My 6 year old LOVES this movie!  I'll be ordering it again soon since out home burned down : (
B001VTTRC6|4.0|very good cast of actors, the acting was very very good. Sean Penn did a great job. Very good story with a great ending.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Wonderful characters, great story, our 3 year old can't get enough.  I just like to hear him say &#34;Despicable Me&#34;. A sweet story with plenty of humor for all ages.
B000IKQK7E|5.0|I've seen this at least a dozen times, but it is just as funny as it was the first time I watched it. We rented it because my daughter was home over the weekend from college and brought a friend. They had never seen it. Both were cracking up. Made for a fun family movie night.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The show gets better each season. I couldn't wait to see the next episode. Love the strong female roles & brilliant writing.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Our daughter read the book for one of her college courses a couple of years ago, and had been telling my wife about it. When the movie came out, they rented it, but I was out of town. Both kept telling me that I needed to see it (I kept telling them it is a &#34;chick flick&#34;), but they persisted. Glad they did. Really opens your eyes up how blacks were treated in parts of the south, (we live in Georgia and I have all my life) especially by the wealthy, upper class. The movie mixes up the plots with many uplifting stories, and has a great ending. Recommend to all.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the few shows truly worthy of watching. Excellent casting & dialogue, hooks you in from the beginning. A must watch!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.  Can't wait for more room's.  Little bit of mind teasing which was nice for a change. Recommend getting it!
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Such a nice film, this is a wonderful fantasy love story with joy to tears emotional rollercoaster, my favorite twist.
B00140PK6O|5.0|My goodness!  From the moment that the story begins, there is so much going on in the lives of the people in Cranford. Cranford is a wonderful place  to live because it is filled with realistic characters. We run across nosy neighbors who are gossiping daily about the affairs that take place, but who rally to the side of each other when tragedy strikes. We see the contrast between ones who are extremely poor and ones with a lot. It is truly a wonderful story filled with romance, intrigue, suspense and down right humor!! If you have never watched it, once you do, you will watch it over and over and over again!
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|I liked this CD but had not heard most of the songs on it. There are a few really good songs. It is a 2-CD set so you do get quite a few songs.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Omb I'm in love with nemo. omg hes so awesome if u love him to then bye this game its the best ever
0764169742|5.0|Great illustrations and good instructions. This book lists what supplies work best and what you need to get started.  Very nice book!
1401937519|5.0|I've been interested in the subject of NDE's for a long time now, and have read many accounts.  This woman describes the experience and what she learned in the most clear and concise way I've ever read. Written with compassion and purpose, this book goes straight to the heart of what an NDE is and why they occur. I learned more reading Anita Moorjani's book on the near death experience, than all of the prior material put together.  The information has stayed with me and I now realize that I had been waiting to learn this information.  Anita has done an invaluable service to us all by being willing to share in minute detail an illness, a death and a decision to return back to her physical body to complete a job she had volunteered to do for fellow human beings  The author writes clearly about what she learned about the origins of physical disease, and teaches through this information how out thoughts are instrumental in creating our mental and physical states. Anita Moorjani uses this book to emphasize the power we have to heal ourselves.  Inspiring and enjoyable, my only complaint is that it was over too soon.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I thought Season 2 superior to Season 1, but I enjoyed both. I am looking forward to Season 3 now that I have seen every episode since the Pilot of the series.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|By far one of my favorites. The story line is amazing and so is the music (It is Daft Punk after all!)
B005PK553C|4.0|I started watching this series in Season 2, and after watching all episodes went back to see what I had missed the previous year. Although the acting was superb in the first season as well as in the second, I feel the series truly hit its stride the next season.
B008EEZ64Y|1.0|I found this to be a huge dissappointment. I didn't like the ending at all and all the loose ends
B002SKZBQS|4.0|Another great story by King.  Always delivers a great read and this was another. Read it on vacation, it was perfect.
0374531269|5.0|I bought this for my 10 and 12 year old grandsons after reading a great review and then reading it myself.  My son read this aloud to them for a number of nights.  This is such a beautiful way to expand their world.  They were all so touched by the journey.  I would highly recommend this book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great way to wake up in the morning. Easy listening alarm sounds and easy navigation to set up alarms. Love this app!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|exactly the features I was looking for, simple and easy to use. I do recommend it. The request to upgrade are bit to frequent in my opinion. but in general a useful tool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of my delights in life.<br />Year after year they keep drawing me in.<br />As family's go this one is so great just as you've<br />thought you've scene it all from them a new layer<br />gets peeled back and here you go again.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old grandson on the first day it was available last week.  He has all the other Dr. Panda games and loves them all.  Although he can play them and enjoy them now at age three, I can see that there is a lot more in the games that he is not utilizing at this time because of his age, which tells me that he'll be using these games for quite some time and by the time he's outgrown them, his little brother can use them.<br /><br />All of the Dr. Panda games are not only entertaining and enjoyable by kids and parents alike, they are also quite educational.  I only wish this particular title had been available earlier when we were looking for something to prepare my grandson for his first airplane trip.  This would have been wonderful as it goes through all aspects of an airplane trip!<br /><br />Highly recommend this.  We use it on my Kindle Fire with Kindle Free Time so there are never any issues of going from this app to the internet or any place that I have not pre-approved!  Great pair!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolute love this game. This is one is more interesting than any of my games I have on my kindle fire. My goal is to score a hold in one on every game.
0385344228|4.0|This was a superbly written thriller by William Landay, an attorney himself who portrayed all the characters very well. In reading the courtroom scenes, I really felt I was present in that courtroom with Neal as the prosecutor, Jacob as the defendant. Throughout the book, I felt Andy had blinders on when it came to his son -- how could a District Attorney who prosecutes criminals daily not see his son as a criminal? Although there is potential reasonable doubt and the reader can make his/her own decisions regarding Jacobs' guilt, I really felt Jacob as the sociopath he was. Andy was in denial throughout the book, while Laurie knew her son was bad, but still protected him. The end of the book offers a real twist, a la John Grisham, which I thought was fantastically done - something no one expects. Didn't know what to expect in this book, since I didn't read any reviews before buying for myself - glad I did, couldn't put it down!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|The game is very interesting. I have figure out how to win. I do enjoyed trying to come up with matching five or more objects.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked the idea that although the book was fiction it was based on real events. It held my interest from front to back.
B004U52VPS|2.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  At the time was really into the Angry Birds craze.  He was so excited to get it but lost interest when it took more time to set up the blocks then it did to shoot the birds at the game.  Even his cousins who played the game with him agreed it wasn't the best idea for a board game.  The slingshot for the game doesn't work well either.  Save your money and play it online, it's a lot more fun than this.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Always a good movie. Great HD streaming quality for Prime. Very high quality. Why does this have a word count?
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|I love this movie it's so funny and Cary Grant is great! It's the kind of movie you watch on a Sunday afternoon when it is raining.
1781162646|3.0|\\"Joyland\\" was a pretty fun book. It was fairly typical Stephen King and made for a good, light read. However, it had quite a slow start, too much build up, and too many unnecessary details.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Who wouldn't like Chris Evans in this movie!! It has action, heart, and adventure. It was a great beginning to the Avenger story.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Huge fan of Star Trek! I loved every minute of this movie. I hope they make more Star Trek movies in the future.
B008602KQI|2.0|It would have been so great if they would have stuck with the book version like Harry Potter. The story line was missing too much for me because I had read the book.
B004SI12CU|3.0|Certainly didn't love this book, but was able to finish it because of an occasional historical tidbit that got me through the painfully dull passages.<br />It's the writing that condemns this book because these are real and fascinating people who must have been wildly impassioned to selfishly screw as many people as they did to fulfill their affair. But Horan flattens them out with corny dialogue and kinder treatment than is likely justified given their actions and they people they were. I've always read that Wright was an egoist and a bastard, but Horan barely addresses those characteristics and only in the most peripheral way late in the book. We can assume by association that his lover was a piece of work too, but Horan somehow paints Mother Theresa instead of a fiery, ahead-of-her-time woman who dumped her kids and husband on her sister and best friend to run off with someone else's husband. It's as if Horan didn't have the evidence or the nerve to candidly tell who they were without a sugarcoated apology. But perhaps that's where fiction comes in: taking two real people who are interesting, remarkable and unlikeable, and portraying them to be not that different than you and me. Why would anyone do that? Snooze fest.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly's fictional hero, is celebrating 20 years in the crime-solving business, and The Black Box was promoted well in advance as a novel that would celebrate the life and work of this unconventional character.<br /><br />The story takes the reader back and forth in time as Harry, who now works in the open-unsolved unit of the LAPD, decides to investigate a cold case, the murder of a young white woman during the Rodney King Riots of 1992. The woman, who was given the nickname Snow White by the press, was shot and killed, almost execution-style, in a somewhat quiet and deserted area of the city. At the time of the murder no witnesses came forth and apart from a bullet, nothing else was found at the scene.<br /><br />Normally nobody would pay too much attention to the incident, since at the time chaos and mayhem prevailed in the city, but when somebody opened fire against Harry and his partner Jerry Edgar, while they were inspecting the scene, things changed; but yet things remained the same, since there was not enough evidence to carry on with the investigation.<br /><br />Now, 20 years later, Harry is still haunted by the case and he's determined more than ever to discover the truth. However, the higher-ups in the chain of command are not so pleased with his decision for political reasons; the victim was white. So they try to stop him. And they fail. When it comes to the politicians, in his precinct, or elsewhere, he couldn't care less. What he cares about is the victims, and his personal need to give the relatives, whoever they may be, some kind of closure. So he battles on, though most of the time he's all alone, and little by little he starts to unravel the threads of the mystery.<br /><br />At the same time he tries to spend as much time as he possibly can with his daughter Maddie, who also wants to be a cop and his girlfriend Hannah Stone, a therapist who has a son in jail, but of course that's not quite easy, since his job is his obsession, it's what he lives for, and it's what more often than not puts him into trouble. Thus it comes as no surprise that he's yet again investigated by the Internal Affairs.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is maybe older now and a little bit wiser, but he hasn't changed. He's as stubborn, restless and uncompromising as ever. He may have mellowed somehow because of Maddie and Hannah, but that's about it. As they say, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.<br /><br />The Black Box is not one of the best Bosch novels. The plot is good and the story runs smoothly, but not always, since every now and then it seems to lose its pace. I think that if it was a little bit shorter it would be much better. It is an enjoyable read though.on, it's what he lives for, and it's what more often than not puts him into trouble.

B00E978FGQ|5.0|Was surprised that I enjoyed it. It had it all! I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian does a masterful job of keeping the reader completely engaged all the was through..<br />Get it today and you won't put  it down.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows I have ever watched. The characters are amazing, the story line is awesome! Absolutely love this show !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not sure why it addicts me, but it does.  Just so well done. No smut either...can watch with my children.  How refreshing!  Have to wait till Jan for Season 4.  ARGH!
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I got this in case I needed to print off my Kindle Fire, I love this app.  I needed some papers printed quickly and it would take too long to boot up my laptop set up the printer and print, I needed them now.  My Kindle loads the web really fast compared to my laptop so I gave it a shot, you just go to e print open up your web page from there and print.  You need to make sue that your location services is on in order to find the printer but that is about it, easy and fast I love this app.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an awesome show bell acted and written. The characters have depth and there is an infinite number of situations they can get into. I highly rate this show
1449382673|4.0|This is meant for the beginner, but quickly gets you right into the meat.  It has a kinda cheezy presentation, but it works pretty good.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|It was good to see an action thriller with an older actor as the star. The action is a little too unbelievable; but, it provides pure escapism fun. There is just enough plot development to hold the action together. The violence is not overboard but leaves several moral issues concerning the main character hanging. It leaves one with the impression that the end justifies the means.
0486284735|5.0|Yes, it's a great book and movie. I really enjoyed it, as do most people. I love historical romance without all the sexy-bits. It's a classic.
1611761069|1.0|The four Cornwell books I've listened to so far have been read by Kate Reading or Kate Burton (are they the same person?  they sure sound the same, quite horrible).<br /><br />The book was so slow and with so many needless, wordy descriptions. Only orse by the narrator's slow, swooning reading style.  I got so lost by all this that I completely forgot the plot.  I finally gave up half way through because by that point I couldn't have cared less  who killed the victim.<br /><br />Good thing I downloaded this from the library and hadn't paid hard earned money on it.  It was a complete waste of time and effort.
0486290492|5.0|Do you not know if this is a good book or not? I mean it's considered a classic and the movie is out. It's one of my favorite books by Austen. That's all I really need to say =)
B000HEWEJO|4.0|I don't think you can get more classic than this movie at Christmas time (though White Christmas could give it a run for it's money)! This is just a joy of a movie to cuddle up and watch with some hot chocolate and a warm blanket and loved ones. I've been collecting my favorite Christmas movies over the last few years, and this one is a treasure. It's message is a good reminder during the festive season. If you haven't seen it, make a point to this year!
0800141660|5.0|Why am I asked to write a review on a movie? OK, here it goes. I liked it a lot. It's one of my favorite (books) by Austen. This movie, especially with this cast, is my favorite version.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very good app<br />It tells you how many hours needed to charge your kindel via upscale electrical charge<br />It tells you how many hours left for each use ex internet ,text ,watching movies
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Yes, it's a great book and a great movie. Not much else needs to be said about it. Reviews have been around for years. lol.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|Starts out slow but the story is intriguing and I has held my interest long enough to consider purchasing it
0385338082|5.0|This is by far, my favorite Sophie Kinsella book! Most recently her novel, Wedding Night, was just as great. I swear I laughed so many times reading this book. I even purchased another for a gift =)
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|I have to say this movie was a big let down...story line was weak and copied from many other movies it seemed. It basically was a futuristic drug movie where the good cops two face overwhelming odds and survive yea.....ahhh....only in the movies. I think they could have done better by maybe continuing on from the original this was just a big waste of film.<br /> One thing that bugged me the most is I dont know why they had to get a known actor for this role because he never takes off the damn helmet..nice try but please dont try again...
0312641893|5.0|OMG! Such a great book! I don't think fairy tale retellings will ever go out of style. I could read them all day long! I love the twist in this book and can't wait to read the rest in the series!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Went to see this movie in the theatre and was amazed I think this is the best so far of the series plenty of action and stories to it not to be missed.
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|The Rode VideoMic Pro is handy to have in your kit. It's great for those moments when you want minimal set up and can't be arsed to hunt for more expensive gear. For run and gun, I think it's fine. I use it primarily for vlogging and short skits around the house. It's a good piece of equipment to have- could audio be better? Yes. But for my needs, it's working out fine. I use it in conjuction with a Canon 7D.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Wish they would have kept the pin ball thing. It's really fun and I probably stay up hours playing thus game.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have played the other Quell games and knew Memento was going to be great! I was not disappointed. I lived these games to keep my brain active.<br /><br />Anxiously waiting for the next one.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|It has some really great actors, especially the terminator herself Summer Glau.  The story line gets a little silly at times but over all a great show.  I have no idea why it didn't last longer.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I so didnt want this book to end....heartfelt story of Lavinia, Belle and the trials of their lives on the plantation
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is the one who love this game. So i downloaded the game and now he is realllllllly happy!!!! I suppose is a good game. I never played. But when i asked him how many stars he told me: 5.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good show. Referred to me by a coworker. The show kept my interest. Went ahead and watched season 2.
B002GSXKN8|2.0|Decent package, but is ok for the price, but picture is very bad quality even for the price, slightly better then the VHS though.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I'm a fan of James Rollins and have enjoyed all the adventures of Sigma Force I've read. I'm amazed at the amount of research he puts into his books and love how much I learn from them.  Not only are they exciting to read they're educational<br /><br />Duffy McMahon
B002RHL8DC|1.0|Stargate was a wonderfully entertaining franchise.  Universe took everything that Stargate was and destroyed it.  The pace was slow, and they had to get into politics.....  Lame, boring, sucked, crappy, cheesy, intolerable, junk, bad characters, no self control,
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Strange story, never understood the point of this book. The blend of fantasy and reality was difficult to understand and never clear.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It was exactly as I expected and works great so far. No problems as of yet but only had the kindle fire hd and the app for about a week.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I ordered this device the first day it was launched - which included the 3 months free netflix subscription. So my total cost of ownership was $11 only, and in that respect it was an awesome device. The Google Cast support in YouTube and Netflix apps is pretty good, and the quality of streaming is as great it can be. Wish 'casting' a tab on Chrome from you laptop would as flawless as playing youtube/netflix content, but this depends on a lot of other factors so I wont really hold it against Chromecast per se.<br /><br />So for a 'beta' - version 1.0 product, I was pretty satisfied with it overall, and use it exclusively to play web content on my TV.I prefer using the Chromecast over the in-built apps in my TV/DVD/Receiver.<br /><br />Version 2.0 needs a couple of things fixed<br />- Re-configuring the device after the first time setup is a pain. I would need it to be powered off and connect to it using its wireless network , but that drops of more often than not. This needs to be fixed<br />- This might be an App issue  but the Netflix app on iOS needs to improve for better playback/integration with the device.<br />- More apps/content providers need to use Google Cast. I wonder what it would take for, say, shows like Daily Show to enable streaming to ChromeCast? A lot of potential for that sort of integration, I hope it happens.
B000AP04L0|5.0|i've watched this movie at least 15 times...we played it at work a few times too - it is so fitting. LOL
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely a great read. The series is way better than fifty shades! Way more to the story line. Great read for the beach!
B006G3JQ78|5.0|Love the songs, Dick Van Dyke, Julie Andrews & all the light hearted entertainment.  Amazing how clean fun can be so entertaining!
0307476073|2.0|I could have titled this review WHAT A \\"FEET!\\" and Cheryl does deserve an A+ for endurance.  However, the cover, subtitle, and first gripping sentence were all deceptive, hence, the false advertising.  Even her last name, that I thought was coincidental, turned out to be made up.<br /><br />My reason for reading this was based on the cover image and subtitle, since I am an avid hiker.  I was under the delusion that she had been physically lost and then found, telling the story of her harrowing nightmare.  I started reading it on the last day of vacation at Tioga Pass in the High Sierra, and the beginning was so depressing that it would have put a damper on my entertainment for the week, had I not spent the earlier time with something truly enjoyable.<br /><br />In spite of the suspense generated by that first sentence, I had second thoughts while slogging through the dismal beginning, but the gnawing need to know what happened kept me on course until she hit the trail.  Unfortunately, she had to bypass the heart of the Sierra, another disappointment that would have provided grist for a better story.  In fact, too much of the book was flashback explanations of why she did the hike in the first place.  These memories were downers and merely filled in where nothing remarkable could be said about the hike.  The sex seemed gratuitous and was probably encouraged by the editor for a spicier story.<br /><br />There is one good thing about reading a highly touted book that is a big disappointment, and that is going right to the one-star reviews on Amazon!  Some of the witty ones below are hysterical and really hit the nail on the head.  Enjoy!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|&#34; something amazingly awesome is going to happen to me today&#34;. has been my mantra ever since Ive read the book and well thats exactly how it happens. Pam's book is a manual for the scientific ones amongst us who need proof of that which is. So, one gets them too, because Pam teaches us how to look at it, with new eyes. We see things but hardly notice the awesomeness in them, and when we put our attention to seeing more of the awesomeness, well we notice things we have not earlier.<br /><br />A non preachy , chatty book, even Einstein would have wanted Pam to be his Teaching Assistant, making even the complex seem so simple.<br /><br />Ive been recommending this one to all my friends, simply because I am selfish, I want them to read this book and be happy so that I can be surrounded by happy people too
B008I43DYU|5.0|CALCULATOR PRO IS GREAT TO HAVE AROUND, LOVE THE WAY THE AMOUNTS SHOW UP, IN CASE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU ENTERED, IT'S AWESOME !
B008NMT684|5.0|he likes and can take it on the go wont let u say no for him to play and will play it tip it dies hahaha haaha lol.
B002ZTQVBQ|2.0|When did you buy this threes ago and decided to sell it to me. Your the worst it looks like a kid had the cover for it and placed it back<br /><br />The WORST
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I got this for my kindle fire hd and it works great with it. It allows you to change font and font size as well as create notebooks with two different page styles and basically make your own notebooks to help organize all of your thoughts. I also recommend an app called eprint (it is free) which allows you to print the whole notebook or specific pages. You can do so by making a notebook/page and converting it into a pdf file. Then open eprint, find the document (it will be the last item on the list) and open it and print.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft P E is really good but it doesn't have everything it needs flint and steel in creative mode you would like to have this
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. It makes you think &amp; pay attention to previous clues.<br />Fun to play over &amp; over. Can't wait until part 2 comes out.
B004FECNIO|5.0|Many of Steven Spielberg's movies are my favorites, but this is my personal favorite Steven Spielberg movie. Watching A.I. brings back many childhood memories and emotions. Some are comforting, while some are painful. Still I enjoy watching this movie, and at  the end I am left with a sense of peace, calm, and warmth. This Blu-ray edition really brings out the richness of the photography. The sound is dynamic and the colors vivid. Artificial Intelligence does what a good science fiction movie should do - allow us to escape for a moment to worlds of imagination and dreams.
B005HEK3JW|4.0|Scary? Yes...this episode of Star Trek so reminds me of the current Candy game craze. I deleted that intoxicating Candy game after 30 minutes of serious inattention to duty. People all around me getting mesmerized as I stand clear.  THE GAME EPISODE foretold this euphoria.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|I LIKE THE MARWARE VIBE STANDING CASE.  I DID NOT LIKE THE PRICE!!!!  If U BUY,  WAIT UNTIL IT GO ON SALE!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good! Very good! Really, very good.  Not kidding! Very good! I plan to watch more episodes.  This evaluation is a drag!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A little bit of real life chess, and memorable characters, makes for a great show. Highly recommended for dramatic, witty, and intelligent writing.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Best effort for quite some time.  Very much has the feel of his<br />earlier novels.  Almost felt like the Stasi were going to pop up somewhere.  I recommend it.<br /><br />Bopoho@msn
B002DQDV6Y|3.0|This episode caught us by surprise with the violence, prevalent themes related to evil, murder, etc., and general level of scariness.  Our 6 yr old really enjoyed the first movie, but we had to stop this one shortly after beginning it because he was getting really scared, and frankly, it was flat inappropriate for his age group.  We made a bad call on that one!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This simple game is a great way to pass the time. It is a lot of fun. I really enjoy it.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|I installed this app on two tablets: an Asus TF101 transformer and Toshiba 10 Excite. It never worked properly on the Asus, so I uninstalled it. On the Toshiba, it completely locked it up and nearly killed it and I had to do a factory-reset. So, use this one at your own risk.
1250029465|5.0|My wife and I both loved it and that's unusual when it comes to books.  If you like cats, and maybe even if you don't, this is a good cat story.  It's also a interesting story of recovery from addiction.  Plus, the book gives you a real feel for what it must be like to live hustling in London.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Well acted, directed, photography and costumes.  The magnificent of it all was spectacular.  Best movie version of this classic story..
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written and provides the reader with a great background on the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.  No leaps of faith in this book, but it does a great job of giving you what current scholarship tells us about politics, society and what life in general was like in Israel at the time.  Some great insights are provided about Jewish society and the Roman occupation and the author does a good job of pointing out numerous anomalies and inconsistencies in the gospel narrative.  Added bonus, it's two books in one.  The author provides significant source material and background in a separate section at the end of the narrative, so that the story doesn't get bogged down in footnotes and references.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I bought this for a friend's birthday.  I was glad that it arrived with the packaging and case in excellent condition.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I had this film on VCR for many years, but wanted to see it again. Loved the book even more than the movie, but I believe justice was done with the film. It is very difficult to turn a novel into a movie, without screwing it up, but Nunnally Johnson and John Ford got it right.
B00DJLLO0M|1.0|Wow what a let down! This album was rushed and lacks heart and soul unlike the 3 previous.  It sounds like Aviv was trying to get a record out to satisfy the record cycle without putting much thought and effort into it.  It's obvious Steven Wilson did not have much to do with it for his touch is missing through out the whole record with the exception of the tracks he obviously composed and performed.  Also, this album is too short! 30 minutes are you kidding me? As a fan since the first record I feel very let down.  Please guys get back in the studio together and top DNA! This IV is just 30 minutes of effortless boring sample tracks. Come on!
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|Great movie! Loved the Nick Nolte hotel scene! Tom Hardy is one of my new favorites. One of the best fight movies!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|because of the price here's something you should know. It's FREE maybe not that long but it's FREE right now!
B0063FGEFG|5.0|The Blu Ray is as good as it gets.  Great picture, awesome bonus features.  I highly recommend this blu ray.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|a show that the whole family can watch together-looking forward to the next season.Very interesting to learn the way of life of the British.
B000SEKNUK|3.0|While it was great to learn about the experiences of Zanders, but they are buried in one case study after another. The format gets a little tiring awhile, when all the time I am wishing for better editing or another more conventional format that is organized by topics. You do get inspired and learn, but you'll have to look for them.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I gave Suits Season 2 five stars because it's just a great show! I love this season better than season 1 and season 1 was very good.<br />I recommend this show to anyone who loves a good laugh and anyone who loves drama.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|This movie was done so well. The cast was perfect; i.e.Hugh Jackman was amazing both as the main character and voice. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially to those of us who read the Victor Hugo story so many years ago. The music and the actors told the story so well.<br />A must see.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's fun for grown ups as well as kids. Glitches on occasion though. I bought some gems then the update deleted my game the next day.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am a Google user on my computer and have been for a long time.<br />Having this feature on my Kindle makes it very useful.<br />While you're on your Kindle too, you don't have to open your<br />computer, you can do it all at once, at home or away.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I am glad I never bought this app because I would have bought ads.  Noone wants to pay for an app that comes with ads.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I read the book some time ago and was interested in seeing the movie.<br />A good friend of mine grew up in Jackson, Miss. and she said that is the<br />way that it was.  The characters are real and humorous. I did get more of<br />a feel for it reading the book but the charactors were well selected and stuck<br />pretty well to the story.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Definitely a great way to open your eyes to the way life should be! Best way to begin to change your financial future and the way you look at money
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|This was a really cute story, the actors were great and<br />Emma was a delightful character who ended up with<br />what she hoped for others.  it's and English story and<br />sometimes I have a hard time catching all the English speaking<br />characters. A movie I'm sure you will enjoy
B009G41CG2|4.0|I prefer this mahjong game over the (Kindle Tablet Edition) although I haven't been able to clear all the tiles off yet.  My favorite mahjong game is Mahjong Titans, but I haven't seen it available thus far.  I'd recommend this version as a close second.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|While modern film makers are trying to spill out classic with a twist. I prefer Classic just as I read them as a young girl. No way does these &#34;new&#34; virgins meets any imaginations of mine. JACK seems like several drunk people got around the table and came up with crazy ideas.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like playing mahjong a lot but this version does not hold my interest at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who really enjoys playing.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game isn't bad to pass some time. Overall it is simple and easy to learn. It gets very difficult as the levels progress.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I don't know one brand from another nor do I know if I paid extra money for this because it seems to be a higher end product. It went on nicely, just a small drop and must be doing a good job since the CPU hasn't burnt out. lol
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is one of the best TV shows that no one watched.  I'd call it more than just a great fantasy series - it's just plain great TV.<br /><br />As a longtime fantasy fan, I had been on the lookout over the years for a good fantasy TV show or movie.  Until I saw this series, I had come to think that maybe fantasy just didn't lend itself to a visual format.  This series changed my mind.<br /><br />This season builds on the heroic quest begun in the first season, with the addition of a heaven versus underworld fight for control of the world.  A new and fascinating character, a female warrior, is added to the group of heroes.  This character balances out their group in terms of gender, but, more importantly, in terms of personality, adding a dose of matter-of-fact directness to a circumspect team.<br /><br />Certainly it's easy to see traces of the director's prior Hercules and Xena series in these characters, but they're less over-the-top here, and so easier to sympathize with.  This series feels less like mythology and more like an action adventure compared to the earlier two.<br /><br />In my opinion, this season succeeds all around.  Emotional impact is surprisingly high for an adventure series.  The scenery, already very well done in the first season, now looks as good as a movie.  The kung-fu style action works, and the magic is relatively convincing.  Its humor might be corny but it's still amusing.  The show is sexy without being smutty.  There are many shades of gray within its good-versus-evil premise.  Also, don't try watching any of the last few episodes unless you have time for them all.<br /><br />Some viewers complained about occasional silliness, but I felt that these lighter moments helped keep the series from being too dark in its entirety.  The main character's acting may also sometimes feel forced, but not so much that it detracted from the series for me.<br /><br />Note to parents: there is a lot of violence, including torture, thatcould be frightening to young viewers.  The main characters use violence defensively and avoid it if at all possible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the series got cancelled at the end of its second season.  This means that the last episode in this collection does not reach a conclusive ending, but instead sets up for the planned third season.  Given how few good shows there are on TV, I really don't understand how this got taken off the air.  I'd love to see a Mini-series that concluded the first two seasons, but only if they brought back ALL of the original actors.
B00BD62X14|5.0|The cd is everything I expected.  I saw her interview on CBS Sunday Morning and couldn't wait to receive the CD. A wonderful addition to my CD library.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I am disappointed to say that I have just cancelled my order for this item.  I really wanted this special edition, however I have just learned that this release will not contain all the extras that were prepared.  For some reason, Paramount decided to split the special features up and give some to other retailers.  In order to get them all, you need to buy 3 different sets of the Blu-ray.  In the end you'll have 3 copies of the Blu-ray and only then will you have the special features.  I have no problem with retail incentives.  That's why we have the phaser, or in the case of other retailers, models of the ships, etc.  The extra features, however, should be on all the DVDs.  The 'video' themselves should not be the extra features.  Nothing against Amazon - it's a great company, but i think with their buying power, they should have had all the features made put on the discs.
0061733199|5.0|This book is a great book to read. My son ordered it, sat down and read the whole thing. Great book.
B008Y7FQ6E|3.0|Scenery in Louisiana interesting.  Story line sorta predictable & OK, but acting by Jones & others good.  It was entertaining when nothing else was worth watching on regular TV
159463176X|4.0|While the book kept my attention, it not as interesting as the author's first two books. It was slow reading.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Wish that your energy regenerated a lot quicker. Other wise it is a pretty good game. Things should cost less coins and jems too, as is they cost too much for me to play at any length.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not bad for a free game. Need to keep putting it down to recharge energy for game,  so spend odd half hours rather than constant playing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The ending does not fit this book and actually made me mad that I wasted time reading this. I had heard such great things yet I was very disappointed
B001HN6EF4|3.0|We bought these to take with us on our beach vacation. The cards have a hole at the top that the clip fits through to hold the deck together. This clip is very difficult to use--hard to remove and hard to reattach. These cards are VERY SLIPPERY! When you place them on top of each other (as with discarding) the cards slide off each other and over the table. They are also difficult to pick up off a flat surface. On sand is fine though b/c you can make a little well for them to sit in. We never really got them wet anyway so next time I would just take our regular Uno deck.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I remember watching some of the episodes when I was growing up but was not able too see all of them. Sense Amazon Prime I now can watch all of the season of Star Trek Next Generation and its even better than I can remember. They don't make many shows like this anymore.
0756655307|4.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He's not a comic book nerd like I am, but he likes the movies so I thought this would get him up to speed. Overall it's a great book. Lots of colorful artwork. The amount of space dedicated to each character is in line with the character's importance or amount of time you've seen the character in the marvel universe. A small time character gets 1/4 a page. Someone like Wolverine gets 4-5 pages. It could be a little more background/story/summarization heavy & a little less artwork heavy though, which is why I took away a star.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Never can go wrong with Star Trek - The whole cast always brings their best to the table. My favorite Star Trek series bar-non
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|Same old conversations as in the prequel.<br />Kind of boring, but enjoyed the traverlogue.<br /><br />Before Midnight trailer looks more interesting.
0316069906|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's &#34;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close&#34; is my favorite book, and I decided to check out this one just for the heck of it with no real interest in vegetarianism or veganism. This book really opened my eyes to the source of the meat we buy and the many ill effects of factory farming. Although I have not become vegan or vegetarian, this book motivated me to make the deliberate decision to never buy meat, milk, eggs, and other animal products at the grocery store (I still allow myself to eat these things occasionally at restaurants and friends' houses). It has allowed me to make more informed decisions on the food I eat. I also appreciated that the author is not one-sided; he presents the topic from a wide range of perspectives, giving you a pretty comprehensive view of the farming industry and making the book both interesting and informative. I highly recommend this book.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Talking Ben is a cute app. It's good for a laugh when the conversation is in need of a little push.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I am an animal lover and have a dog and a cat. This story is so refreshing,reading about the love, admiration and respect that Bob and his owner have for one another. It's a love story !!!!!! I know if I saw them on the street I would have the same reaction that people in the book had.  I too would stop and talk and want to pet Bob,and would bring him food and treats.  Bob and Jim are great for each other and Bob gives Jim responsibility and the courage to better.himself and to become drug free.  I hope they live long lives together!!!!
B002M87V0A|5.0|He's a music man.  One of the most loved musicals of all time.  Great music and great lines to be used in conversations.  I'm a music teacher and often refer to the &#34;Think System&#34; before singing or playing.  :-)
B00CX7TOOG|5.0|I just saw this movie over the weekend and I've watched it 5-6 times, already!<br /><br />DeNiro and Travolta give great performances as two characters involved in a life-or-death game!  It got a little hokey at the end, which spoiled a very realistic beginning and middle, but they pulled it off.  I would have preferred to see a more gruesome ending.<br /><br />In real life, I doubt very seriously that a Serbian rebel would forgive an American soldier for killing his family and fellow mates in Serbia during the Serbian/Croatian war.  This is where Hollywood screws up a good movie that delivered good scripting unitl it got to the end.  The fairy tale-like ending killed a really good movie, BUT, it is really worth seeing with DeNiro and Travolta--two A-list actors!
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|I did not like the game at all.  I played it once and deleted the game.  It is not one I enjoyed.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|It does improve the Golf game. I was surprise to see how far off the course distance markers were. especially effective when under 100 yards. able to place balls closer to the pins.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This an excellent game, not too easy but not too difficult that you give up.<br />A good mix of hidden object and puzzles.<br />Something for everyone.<br />I will give it four stars.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|There is not to much you can say about a movie, but i do like true stories and stories that unfortunatley do end up sad sometimes which this one does.  But it definetley shows that no matter WHAT happens in our lives we all have the ability to overcome and not let it get us down.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My husband and I love this and our grandkids are crazy about it!  So Cute!  I highly recommend this show to anyone.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I liked the authenticity aspect of this film.  It made you feel you were living back in the 1860's. Reminded me of another fine film, of this genre, Ride with the devil.
B00821OX98|5.0|i love the story lines, the actors and actress are great i cant wait for season 4.I<br />cant wait<br /><br />c
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I watched the Netflix series based on this book and was intrigued by piper and her journey so I bought this book. Obviously it was less dramatic than the show but provided better insight into the federal prison system and some of its flaws. It was a good read and at some parts it made me laugh out loud!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love, love, love this show! I am a sucker for period entertainment and this series is excellent. Julia Sawalha is amazing as the teasingly meddlesome post-mistress.
1416972250|2.0|This series will not be a classic on any book lovers shelves. It is a pastiche of all that is popular in current &#34;young adult&#34; literature and seems aimed at making money for the author and film makers hoping for the next big series.
B006S086AM|4.0|I thought it was going to be a really goofy movie, when I saw the Saturday Night Live comics in the line up, but it was actually a pretty good coming of age story.
0307744434|5.0|This semi-non-linear story is full of mystery providing many twists and turns. The author creates such vivid visuals but sometimes just the right amount of vagueness to let your mind's eye run wild with fantasy. I'd say it's a must read especially for Harry Potter fans who miss going into a magical world. This is a different kind of magic but the feeling is familiar.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|It was interesting...but a really sad story ...it's amazing what drugs to you people, and especially the unsuspecting Mom and diet drugs.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it!!  Can't wait for next season to begin. Easy to download on  my Kindle and viewed all three seasons.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It is very hard to figure it out. There are no help advises. Got bored with it because I couldn't figure out the object of the game.
1932100660|5.0|My son ( 36 yr old ) wanted to borrow my book, I just gave it to him, happy that he wanted more information, he is a testimony , that , after reading it, it's changed his way of eating, etc.  He and his wife have always been health conscious, but this was awesome for them.  i am still reading it, and love the FACTS... things I knew, and believed, but these are all proven scientifically... great book !!
B008FWHGYS|4.0|I like this movie because of the actors! The story was odd, but interesting. I did not like the ending - if you like movies with different story lines, somehow fit together this movie is for you!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So fun for all family, enjoy doing all the activities and horse 're-lated chores. I was looking for something different to do and I stumbled across this app. Having fun with it since. Hoping to continue on with growing my horse farm with more horses and gear. Horses are interesting animals
B004G606K8|5.0|This is the book that began my lifelong love of the SciFi/Fantasy genre!<br /><br />Magic. Dragons. Knights.  Archers. Chivarly. Adventure. Good versus Evil.<br /><br />This book has a little of everything and it is always the first book I recommend to any friend who has never read a fantasy novel.  I still haven't had anyone I've recommended it to not like it yet.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|the idea behide the movie was good but could have been done differently to make the movie flow and easier to understand.
B00368PSN2|5.0|Really Really good movie. It was a great story line and original too. I would definitely watch it again. You gotta see this i guarantee you'll see something you've never seen before.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I did not want to see this movie but, my husband really wanted to... I must say I really enjoyed this movie.. This is a must see..
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I just discovered K.R. and love her style.  Her voice is very easy to listen to and sounds are solid.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I remember this movie when I was growing up.. My kids loved it just as much as I did.. great kids movie..
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The only bad thing is the ink ran out WAY too fast.  but that was not the reason for buying.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I hope that there is a follow up movie to this one.  Both my husband and I agreed on a movie that we both like and bot want to see a follow up movie..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good, but not as good as his first two novels. It switched back and forth between characters and scenarios and it was a bit hard to keep everyone straight if you didn't read right through.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|This movie is Funny from start to finish.. I would watch this movie again.  Put it on your must watch list if you haven't seen it already.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. I wasn't able to put it down. Super sexy and hot. This will so be a book I read again
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids love the little yellow people..  They watched this movie twice in one day and then again the next day.. I must say that I Also liked the movie..
B00785P2QC|1.0|unless you can wait a whole month of just looking at little trucks running around, dont' waist your time, you have to bother your friends with updates, and check in everyday . total waist of time and money.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|This movie was a really good movie.. I would watch it again.. Put this one on your watch list. OK..
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game, although is a little bit demanding. It's a relaxing game and I love the background's music.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|This game takes you threw obstacles and shows you how to care for animals. I actually learned a little from it. This game is also a ton of fun. Definitely worth buying!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good read. Hard to put down. And a quick read also! I recommended it highly. Give it a chance!
0684824906|5.0|Have just started reading a Team of Rivals but so far<br />it is hard to put down since I love political history.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, at least until it got kind of complicated.  The first levels are very much like Lemmings, and I think they even make the same sounds when they jump into the hole.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|OMG this show is riveting!  I can now see what all the hoopla has been about!  I can't wait for the next season to start!
B00EEXST2K|2.0|I was one of Chuck Traynors best friends in the late 60's. I managed his bar, the Vegas Inn in North Miami for him when he went out of town shopping for drugs, which was quite often. Chuck was a commercial pilot and flew to South America frequently, he was a laid back guy that didn't talk much,,,, very unlike the animated character in &#34;Lovelace&#34;. Chuck showed enthusiasm for nothing but rather studied people and slowly manipulated them with well crafted words. Chuck seldom laughed, he had an air about him that said &#34; listen to what I'm about to tell you&#34;. He was very persuasive in that way.<br /><br />Had his character been portrayed realistically, it would have been a very different flick.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great, sweet movie about the special relationship of a dog and his human. Neat how they shot some of the movie from the dog's perspective. Really enjoyed it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fantastic and everyone should get it I have not stiled playing this game sense I got it it is the most fun ever
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes, Cant go wrong with this book set. Great addition to my library. Mr. Watterson was way ahead of his time.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|this is one of those movies that i have to keep watching. if i have a friend that has not seen it yet i force them to watch it. it is rare to have clean humor..
B0091X2K0A|5.0|War is ugly and military life is not easy.  Shows the real life and treatment of men who will become soldiers
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|so.. the only reason i watched this is my gf made me. there are a lot of great actors that might have just stepped out of their comfort zones a bit in singing... for me it was a one time watch.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|I find this to be more genuine for the life on early submarines. Not the Hollywood versions that make the boats look like luxury hotels
B00AREIAI8|4.0|During my down time I love to play this game. You can choose when to clean, feed, pet, or overall care for your horse and not have to do it on the games terms. Of course if you don't do the tasks it would be harder to advance farther in the game. The competitions are simple but I personally don't mind that as to the fact you choose when you want to compete and train for the competitions. There are of course other neat features like earning money for desired tack and clothing to a different horse or scenery. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the graphics. They are not terrible in the least but I have played games with better. Also I would have liked more choices for a new horse's coloring for they are limited. Overall a great game.
B004H83IK0|5.0|This is a great story line and a well presented movie...perhaps i am prejudiced because i was in SA when this occurred. it is still a worthwhile historical film and it is worth  watching to see what happens in other parts of the world..It also gives a unique perspective on Nelson Mandela
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|if you don't have the time to give, you should NOT get this game because you will not be able to put it down once you begin.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|All over, Stargate was fun to watch. Parts of it were comedic and gave a bright contrast in relation to the dark imagery and secrets the crew discovered. Some of the characterization seemed a bit cardboard, or I would have given the movie a 5. I'd recommend it to people who like sci fi and action adventures.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I saw the movie when it originally came out, so I pretty much knew what to expect. Having just finished reading the novel for the first time, wanting to compare and contrast the book and the film, and not being able to find the movie anywhere, I turned to Amazon.com, which had several options to choose from. Though the movie has aged semi-gracefully (the stop-motion perspective-driven climax is considerably dated), some of what scared me as a kid, unsurprisingly, no longer does. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in walking down memory lane, however. Tim Curry is still phenomenal (and check out Seth Green as Richie).
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudors season 1 gives a sense of the period and some of the things that motivations and occurrences of the time. Some of the real life characters are combined or left out in favor of smoothing the story to make it watchable. It is still an entertaining look into Tudor England.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Anyone who loves good singing, good musicianship, good songs will love this album.  Even if you say you don't like country music, you'll love this album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent program me and my wife watched all 3 season in 2 weeks. We couldn't get enough of this show
0061801313|4.0|Ordered this for my younger daughter because she watches the TV show by the same name. She has enjoyed reading them - I don't know why. Was delivered fast and in pristine condition at an incredible price. It would just pain me to give it that 5th Star...
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|As a long-time Star Trek fan, this is one of my favorite Trek movies, and the film deserves a five-star review. There are many other reviews that sing the film's praises, so I won't focus on that here.<br /><br />The DVD/BluRay release is insulting. I pre-ordered the 3-disc 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital set trusting that the set would be as feature-packed as the previous film. The set contains:<br /><br />* 42 minutes of \\"making of\\" features<br />* No trailers<br />* No commentary<br />* Nothing else you can think of<br /><br />To be fair, Amazon also has the set with the phaser. Wal-Mart has the set with the Hot Wheels Vengeance. I'm fine with these little \\"exclusive\\" perks. But then:<br /><br />* Best Buy/Cinema Now's exclusive set has 30 minutes of additional exclusive features<br />* Target's exclusive set has 30 minutes of additional exclusive features<br />* iTunes has an exclusive commentary by J.J. Abrams and company<br /><br />That's right: There's a commentary by the director and *none* of the DVD/Blu-ray releases have it. This isn't a film where no commentary was recorded; they simply did not bother to release it outside of iTunes. While the discs come with a digital download code, that means that purchasers who want the commentary must (1) Make sure to redeem the iTunes code, *not* the Vudu edition, despite the fact that Vudu plays on more devices and (2) Are still limited to watching the commentary on their computers. Due to technical issues, the commentary is not viewable on iPads, iPhones, etc., to say nothing of watching it on your TV. To purchasers who did not realize this and redeemed the \\"wrong\\" one not knowing the special features would be different (or perhaps not even realizing the digital version *has* special features): Tough luck. Syncing your computer audio and your Blu-ray player isn't an option either because the commentary contains branching, although I doubt many would want to go this route anyway.<br /><br />The Amazon sets are missing at least an hour of featurettes. (Note that Paramount is to blame for this, not Amazon.) Even the \\"exclusive\\" sets are still missing a minimum of 30 minutes. (To make it worse, the DVD-only release has *nothing* on it other than the film. Believe it or not, there are still a lot of fans without Blu-ray players who love features, but I accept that this is gradually changing, so I'm not knocking the rating for the DVD issue.) Missing features on the Amazon sets include:<br /><br />* The Journey Continues... Again<br />* Rebuilding the Enterprise<br />* Full of Wrath<br />* Kirk & Spock<br />* Visual Preferences<br /><br />This is not fair to the fans. I'm waiting for Paramount's \\"ultimate release\\" of the film, or at least one that has a commentary. I'll happily change this to a five-star review if they release a decent set.<br /><br />Reported on at:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Splendid book and well researched. Romance and history in a splendid mix.once you start reading it is dificult to put down.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Nice movie, watched it with my pre-teen.  It was a little much for my 6 year old especially Hydra's face pull off.<br />Good message about the little guy, teamwork, supporting one another, loyalty, etc.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I already read this book before but I think that it's still really good. If can't wait until I reread the next book, because there all worth rereading!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Loved the story and the way it is told. Was able to transport me to a time and place before the Afghanistan we hear of today. It could be a bit disjointed at times but you can still follow it quite easily. The themes of loss and abandonment were portrayed very well.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Bringing back old school hard rock. I really think they can take the torch from our favorite metal bands of all time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I cannot wait for the next season to be released on Prime.  I just cannot get enough of Downton Abby!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love the songs on this CD, grankids love Boys Round Here, keep them coming Blake!!  Would order again and again
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's a fun easy game which I like to think gives my brain a workout.  I am an older person who wants to keep stimulating my mind and this is a fun way to do it.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Word perfectly and was very cheap well worth the money spent, overall great product to buy from them it worked.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This purchase was a gift.  The young lady who received it was thrilled as this was a much coveted birthday gift.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to start watching Doctor Who. Until last week I had only ever watched a few random episodes. You will definitely be addicted after the first few episodes.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|THIS IS A FAVORITE MOVIE THAT I NEVER CAN WATCH ENOUGH.  I HAVE A LAKE HOUSE AND THIS IS A SPECIAL FILM--SO BEAUTIFUL AND CALMING.  IT WAS A GREAT BUY--THANKS AGAIN AMAZON!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|The quality of this game was excellent. It was the movie itself. I did not like the animation like scenes in the movie. It appeared really fake.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Good pricing and a great series.  This is one of the series to binge over in years.  Enjoyed by the whole family (teen and over).
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|You can see by all the excited reviews that this must be good.  But maybe it's all those wackie Trekkies who wrote in and they would have liked anything Trek.  Well, let me tell you, you will be sorry when this series ends even after 7 seasons.<br /><br />Most television is vapid throwaway crud that just entertains at best.  Rarely do you run into something that goes way beyond and actually can change how you see yourself and life.  Rarely do you feel moved by a subtle spiritual or humanistic message enough to make you feel different.  I hope I'm not overselling this series but, yes, it is that good.<br /><br />I highly advise that you watch The Next Generation seasons before starting this because there is a backdrop that is somewhat important especially when some of The Next Generation characters start showing up.  You will still love it either way, but it will make more sense if you see the other series first.<br /><br />Well I don't need to baby you about what this is all about because, if you watch it, you will find out.  I hope you find it as enjoyable and illuminating as nearly everyone else has.  There's a reason why most consider this the best version of Star Trek and that honor you will see is well-deserved.
0920668372|5.0|Great book!  This is a must for every new baby boy's mommy!  A must read if you are a new parent!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  I find it hard to put down once I start.  Challenging, but not too hard.  Would definitely recommend this.
1400069807|5.0|One of the best investigative reporting I've seen.  Very readable and chock full of facts and figures. Everyone who buys processed food should read this book.
B00CX7OW1G|1.0|I must have completely missed that this movie was foreign.  I tried to read the subtitles but got tired and fell asleep.  If I knew what was being said I might have understood better but I just didn't get it at all.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I played this on my wii and it was fun its just like the one on the wii just try it
B003QSPTAY|5.0|I loved this movie when I was young and love it even still!  It is a great family movie, funny and sneaky (I loved watching the twins and their trickery on the parents), I felt happy seeing the parents split, then brought back together as a child-always giving me hope!<br />The new Parent Trap is absolutely no comparison and should be banned (dramatic, I know).
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was information that I never heard in my history classes. Written in an engaging way, the author develops a story that weaves a plot which grabs you and keeps you engaged.  It culminates in a feel good resolution. I enjoyed this read, and bought a gift copy for my best friend's birthday.
B0027Z5DM6|5.0|Adam Sandler was amazing in this movie.  Full of goofiness, sadness, happiness-just a well rounded movie and a bit of a tearjerker!<br />Give it a watch-it is a well done movie.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|My Husband and I watched it right away and were not disappointed. Bruce Willis did not disappoint us, as usual.
B003Y5USF0|4.0|I'll admit it is not a bad movie at all, but it is not a mind-blowing movie, however it has some pretty good suspense once in a while.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I could watch this again and again....<br />After watching on Netflix, I had read somewhere<br />how much had been cut....<br />I enjoyed the movie so much, I wanted to see the<br />uncut version.... And I am not sorry.....<br />Granddaughter comes in and says, &#34;gam, you're<br />watching this again???&#34; LoL....<br />I love the different BBC series.... Very enjoyable....
B007MDB71O|5.0|Is it 100% true to the source material (which happens to be nearly a century old and predates Star Wars by nearly 80 years)? No, and that may be a good thing. But what it is is 150% faithful to the spirit of the series of novels. It has been a long time since I've seen a good action adventure scifi with heart. These days, scifi gets too caught up in &#34;the message&#34; and forgets to have fun.  I love how this film upgrades John Carter to a less perfect, multi-dimensional character vs the pulp style of old without losing the feel.<br /><br />Disney has no one to blame but their poor market for this film's failure at the box office. Beautiful visuals, solid script, perfect casting. A must see for any scifi fan.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I do not espect less from the interpretation and performance of this artist. he bring all the maxim, in a word &#60; perfect&#62;
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent! The author scrapes together the few facts known about Jesus and his story and gives us an interesting and very plausible scenario for what went on. It's refreshing to hear the story based on as much logic as will apply and not supported by &#34;facts&#34; from the gospels. I would guess that the book will have the endorsement of a number of scholars as well as theologians. Aslan has done a fine job.<br /><br />Eugene F. Shewmaker
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|I don't think any review I could give would qualify as an expert opinion.  I just enjoy good music, and I don't think Led Zeppelin has ever made bad music.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is awesome! I love omnom! And I figured out a way to change what you feed him. On the menu screen just tap on the candy and it will change. You can choose candy, donut, or a cupcake. I reccomend this game for everyone. Hope this helped!!
B000UZ4G8M|3.0|Volume 2 my favorite soundtrack. I've listened to it multiple times compared to Volume 1 and 3, which have only been played once. Of course it's all subjective.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I found his story interesting, however I do not believe this is a message from God.  It contradicts the bible, and he has no humility.  If someone wants a real glimpse of God's glory, this is not the book to find it.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I kept hearing this on xm radio on the kids place live station and loved it. Decided to buy for me and my daughter
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|I'm really amazed on how much Riptide GP change. This game is really amazing and highly addictive. Here's what's new on Riptide GP 2.<br /><br />+Graphics 5/5 = the graphics is amazing the surrounding is much brighter and the water effects is much realistic and you could see the bottom floor.<br /><br />+Gameplay 5/5 = the gameplay is very smooth and I've been playing the game  for 2 hours today and I haven't notice any lag or any problems at all.<br /><br />+SoundEfect 5/5 =  the sound effects are amazing you could really here the engine roar and the music is fantastic.<br /><br />Here's what's new on Riptide GP 2:<br /><br />+New Jets<br />+Customizable Jets<br />+Upgradable Jets<br />+New tracks/Map<br />+Multiplayer mode<br />+New 3D Graphics<br />+All New Stunts<br /><br />Why 4 stars you say? It's because every time your about to race a message keeps popping up and it's says Riptide GP error/crash. Here's what you do if you experience that instead of closing the game choose wait instead of ok, once you click wait the game will be running again after you click wait. Other than that the game is pretty amazing.<br /><br />This game is pretty easy to play, is really fun, and it's cheap. And that's why I recommend this to everyone. Enjoy and hopefully I help you guys with my honest review of the game.

B00CSV7AOI|5.0|It has songs that immediately jump out and grab your attention ( Full Circle and Call me in the Afternoon) but then the more you listen the more you start love every song to where you can't pick a favorite out of the bunch. I find myself recommending the whole album to people when they ask which songs are good.
B0015AARJI|5.0|good, easy to handle, easy to charge, no cons so far. It's all what I expected for a wireless controller
B00006AW2M|4.0|Why do SO many reviewers, whether professional or amateur, feel the need to say that \\"THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST is the Stones' answer to SGT. PEPPER?\\" While it's a reasonable observation, it's a tired observation and has been for, oh, fifty years or so!<br /><br />And, while no Stone has ever said that's what it was, no less an authority than Paul McCartney has ALWAYS claimed that PEPPER was the Beatles' answer to PET SOUNDS! Now, how many reviewers would be dumb enough to dismiss PEPPER as an \\"obvious response\\" in the first sentence of their review?<br /><br />The second half of the '60s was a heady, competitive time where artists bounced floated borrowed stole ideas off one another and seemingly any and every other type of music ever created (country, folk, jazz, Indian, vaudeville, baroque, classical, musique concr&egrave;te, etcetera).<br /><br />It's just as accurate (and, ultimately, just as meaningless) to say that EVERY record was a response to a previous record. So, let's just stick to reviewing the actual record and get on with it!<br /><br />By the way, TSMR is so joyful a record (\\"Why don't we sing this song all together, open our heads let the pictures come\\") that it converted me from a Stones hater to a Stones lover upon first hearing in December 1967! My opinion of it has only gone UP in the intervening years.<br /><br />Oh, and the title of my review is a friendly, competitive poke at Ricky Wright's review that was selected for the page's Editorial Reviews that precedes it . . .

B003L20IHO|5.0|For me it is a good drama dealing with the death of a love one and the affects of that experience.  All the different aspects of changes that happens and the affects of the belief of the afterlife.  Well done and acted.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series so far, is very entertaining.  It is a science fiction post alien invasion look at what life is like after the hostile aliens takeover.  With an adequate human element and the occasional love story worked in. Enjoyable!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was absolutely awesome!  It was a great story and visually appealing, best movie iv seen in a while.  Very pleased.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I liked better than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Full of action, can't wait to start the next book in the Trilogy.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I very much enjoyed the story line and complex characters. Their high school journey is fascinating...I am at a loss for well written words. However, I do feel high school dynamics was well captured, as was the struggles of these kids surviving and even finding strength and resiliency. One gets a sense their popular peers might only start such a journey on graduation where this story leave off, and some may not start at all but continue to live in the past of this short period in life...Okay, so I took thoughts farther than they go in the movie. However, many of us do know that story.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Captivating, and surreal , gives you energy and takes away your own issues in life or puts them into perspective.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Good story. I liked the whole 'boys will be boys' concept. Reminded me of being a kid and exploring and having fun with friends.
B005QMOZOO|3.0|It was a plausible continuance of the famous literary couple. Characters well drawn though Elizabeth lacked depth. Murder plot a little weak but plenty of 'Austenisms' which were great.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game was great<br />I really liked it the graphics were ok but over all it was good ok then I don't know what to write
0756407915|3.0|I'd rate this book either 3 or 4 stars.  On its own merits, it'd probably rate a solid 4, but on the heels of \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" it just seems a little bit disappointing.  It's still absolutely an excellent book, though, and if anything it's probably just suffering from the \\"middle of the trilogy blues.\\"<br />This book actually has more action than the first, and Kvothe progresses much farther along his path to becoming the most legendary figure in his world, but something seems to be lacking.  Perhaps it seems a little disjointed at points?  Some of the story arcs seem to happen at random, which, while more like real life, seems a little out of place in fiction.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is still an absolutely wonderful book, full of all the same brilliant wordsmithing on Rothfuss's part, all the engaging wit and charm of Kvothe, and plenty of action, humor, and intrigue.<br /><br />If you've already read \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" you're absolutely going to read this one as well, and the next when it finally arrives.  Just be prepared to enjoy this one a tiny bit less.<br /><br />One last thing:  this book is not nearly so squeaky clean as the first.  It has tremendously more violence, and where the first had no sex, this one has a lot.  However, the sex is not particularly graphic, unless you think really hard about the euphemistic names of some of the sex acts.  Just an FYI.  It didn't bother me, but it did affect what people I felt comfortable recommending the series to.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|I was so thrilled and so much of joyful to see a cristal clear picture quality and the sound quality was also superb. Excellent collection to have it in everybody's blu ray collection.
0756405890|5.0|Let me just get this out there:  this is the best fantasy novel (though I'd assert it can hold it's own against any genre) in many years.  Kvothe is an interesting, well rounded character.  He's a prodigy any way you slice it, but he's flawed enough not to come across as a Larry Stu or a Superman.  The pacing is excellent.  The plot is engaging.  As an added bonus, this book is suitable for pretty much all ages.  (However, the sequel is somewhat less so...)<br /><br />For me, however, the real highlight of this book is Rothfuss's incredible skill with words.  This book is absolutely poetry in prose, without being purple.  Even if nothing was happening, it's still be a pleasure to read.<br /><br />I'll leave it at that, since there are already a ton of longer, better written reviews here, so you hardly need to take my word for it.
144233620X|5.0|Although it is fiction, it is written by a psychologist who has dealt with many people who have Alzheimers.  This book is unique in that it is written from the perspective of the person who has it, not the caregiver.  More and more people are getting this dreadful disease, and other forms of dementia, especially baby boomers.  I think this book should be required reading for everyone.

B0020PJJHS|3.0|I'm a fan of Brosnan, but wasn't really more than casually interested in Bond up until Craig took over the role.  (I watched Casino Royale on a whim and was shocked by how much better it was than my expectation.) Brosnan was a good Bond, better than any but Connery and Craig, I think; but the movie was was a low-to-middling example of the series, I think. Too many Bond tropes (the airplane stunt in the beginning sequence was unbelievable, the seduction scenes were pro forma--nothing felt thicker than a cartoon. A perfectly serviceable Bond Flick, but a ultimately a waste of Brosnan, Densch, and Bean's talents.

0765350386|2.0|Okay.  I'll admit this book isn't as bad as a DnD book, but I'm going to compare it to one anyway because it tries really hard to be.<br /><br />The first thing I will say is that this book is loved for the magic system.  Basically the magic system works as so: You're either born with it or you're not, you need components to use it, but once you have them (ingested) it works more or less like the force from star wars, only you're limited to one, or you can use them all.  So imagine if every force power required a different component and that was more or less it.  Sound complex and well thought out?  I admit it's better than completely unexplained magic, but beyond that it depends I think on how you further expand on it.  This book doesn't, and it breaks it's own rules.<br /><br />My main gripes are the moral ambiguity (there is none, bad guys are bad good guys are good, very cliche).  The subtlety (there is none).  The character depth (almost none to be found either) and finally the world reacting and living and breathing (it doesn't).  To explain how I felt the world didn't follow it's own rules I go to the first action sequence where we see one of our main characters breaking into a well guarded house, using no stealth what so ever, stealing something and basically showing that the entire enemy everything isn't capable of bringing down one dude.<br /><br />First we have the regular guards.  He could go through it seems an infinite number of them, I'm going to let that slide, lets move on to the hazekillers, specifically trained and designed to deal with people like him.  He makes entirely short work of them (but they manage to hurt him a little!)  bah.  Pathetic, this was the author's poor attempt to make it seem like his main characters arn't walking deus ex machina's.  To prove it? I will now explain why the hazekillers should have won.  First of all, they would of used better weapons than canes, spiked clubs with non metal spikes?  Why not poisoned spiked clubs.  Second they would of had ranged weapons (bow and arrows with glass tipped arrows?  Poison those too!) third they would of used cheap tactics (poison gas anyone?  How about poison gas that specifically reacts to someone who just ingested a lot of metal).  Finally they would of actually attacked all at once like the book said they would, but they didn't do.  Instead you're treated to the main character taking them out one at a time while the others apparently watch in wonder.  Somehow I read on from this section, but make no mistake, it's more or less a foreshadowing of the authors writing.  Then other allomancers (magic users) show up.  What does he do?  Well he leaves, but here is what bugs me, why would they let him get away?  They use all the same tricks, there are more of them and yet, he's  able to deflect them.  Why?  They're all pushing and pulling on metal, you have to assume two people pushing on metal is better than one and even if he's the best of the best he'd have to be that many times better than everyone else to go against multiple other allomancers at once while alone.  (but he runs away).  Yeah, how exactly?  They just watch him leave a window and figure, huh, can''t chase him or anything.  No.  In a fight you need to think like the other person is just as trained and dedicated to winning as you are, otherwise you're just having a fantasy.  He maybe the best of the best most clever and skilled, but there are more of him and they make NO EFFORT to demonstrate any training or skill what so ever.  This first action sequence unfortunately gives a good idea of what this book ultimately is.  An overhyped fantasy.<br /><br />Then there are the characters themselves.  So far everything I've had to say about this book is it's flat.  So are they.  Also cliche.  When the heroine is saved from the situation she's in there are these hilariously one dimensional guys she hangs out with who are incapable of seeing the writing on the wall or making good decisionsfor what is about to happen to them.  It's a common tactic a book will do to get some emotional investment out of a reader, but it's also ineffective when it's so obvious.  I don't care that unbelievable dude gets his just deserts, he's seems like a cardboard cutout anyway and really strawmen getting knocked over just isn't fun to read.<br /><br />I should note that this isn't indicative of this author, he is very skilled and every complaint I have about this book I don't have about some of his other works.  My suggestion? Skip Mistborn, READ Stormlight.for what is about to happen to them.

B004TSXUWY|5.0|What would your life be like if, every time you went to sleep, your life was erased, and on waking you found you were twenty years older than you thought you should be, and lying next to a man you do not recognise who claims you live a life you cannot recall? I cannot imagine that, but this is what Christine has to deal with every day. The victim of a terrible attack, Christine has both long- and short-term memory loss and while her brain seems to make new memories, she cannot recall them. Her husband, Ben, takes care of her, and has to help her remember her own life every morning. When we meet Christine, she is waking up on one such morning, horrified to find herself aged twenty years and with no recollection of the man in her bed. After he has reminded her of the necessary things she has forgotten, like him, and the fact that they are married, and that she was injured in an accident many years before leading to her memory loss, he goes to work and she receives a call from a Dr Nash. He tells her he is a neuropsychologist and that they have been working together on recovering her missing memories, and asks her to meet him. She does so and he hands her a journal, explaining that she has been writing in it every day, and that he calls her to tell her where it is so that she can keep writing down what she remembers about her life. She then reads it, and we read with her the story she has been telling herself about her life in her journal. On the first page she finds a note to herself, from herself, saying 'Don't trust Ben'. As the story progresses, Christine begins to remember more and more of her life, before the loss of her memory, and the more she remembers and writes down, the more she realises that Ben is only be telling her part of the truth about her life, their life, and that he may not be who he says he is. What she can't work out is why he would lie to her when he says he loves her and that they are happily married...<br />This is a gripping read. Nothing is revealed too soon, and there are twists and turns you may guess at but that are very satisfying and also a surprise when they come. There is a part at the end which seems a little too easy, but other than that, I loved this book. I would really recommend it to those who like a good mystery/human story, but don't want to have to delve into too much of a psychological thriller to get a bit of suspense and a good story.revealed too soon, and there are twists and turns you may guess at but that are very satisfying and also a surprise when they come.

B008TRH5N6|3.0|Too much talk and less action. Is a very simple process too much extended. With less words and more insights would be a better book. Judging for the price is a good book either
B003XDXVXO|5.0|A funny take on birth.  And shows how complicated life can get sometimes!  I laughed out loud several times!  Would definitely recommend this one for humor!

B008RTE08E|5.0|I often feel The Beatles' \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" film has been treated rather unfairly by critics in the past. Of course, you might sense a hint of bias on my part because I'm such an enormous fan of the Beatles, but I genuinely think the film has a lot to offer if approached the right way.<br /><br />The film was made for television in September 1967 and shown on BBC1 on Boxing Day evening that year. It was meant to be a colour extravaganza but the BBC broadcast it in black and white so even the 200,000 or so people with colour TV receivers in Britain at the time would not have been able to watch it as it was intended to be presented. Therefore, the aerial views shot over Iceland that were used for the \\"Flying\\" instrumental sequence would have been lost on initial viewers. Even so, that wouldn't have been enough for critics and viewers alike to pan the production. I suppose it was pretty far out and not at all what people were expecting, especially for festive period viewing from the biggest band in the world with whom they associated the stuff of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help!\\" when it came to Beatles' films.<br /><br />The Beatles (particularly Paul) had been experimenting with making home movies and from this grew the idea for making \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". The group's manager, Brian Epstein had just died and, as the story goes, Paul came up with the project as a means to keep the band actively involved with one another at a time when Epstein's death could have splintered them. They had stopped touring and had only recently released an album (\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\") and single (\\"All You Need Is Love\\"), so the idea of doing a television film was, perhaps, the best direction.<br /><br />Some fans and music critics like to blame Paul for the Beatles' failings after Brian died. Indeed, John Lennon did so himself later on, accusing Paul of keeping the band going for his (Paul's) own sake. Perhaps there's some truth in that but I don't think Paul was being entirely selfish. The Beatles were still a band and, therefore, still had a job to do. Paul was always prolific when it came to writing music and coming up with ideas and I think he was just excited and keen to run these by the group and commit them to tape. John might have later complained about Paul always being the one to call the other three band members up and saying it was time to make another record, but if he hadn't then the other three would have just sat around being unproductive. Thus, Paul became the driving force in the band's later years and was almost forced to take charge after Brian died just so as to get things done. Paul often gets the blame for \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" but don't forget George, Ringo and John all happily went along with it and made their own contributions. If they didn't like it they could have always vetoed the idea.<br /><br />I first saw \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" in 1992 when I bought a copy of it on VHS video tape from the local supermarket in Withington. My dad bought my mum a Betamax video recorder for Christmas in 1984 and by '92 it had breathed its last. He replaced it with a VHS video player but when we installed it we found, for some odd reason, that it would only play video tapes in black and white. I find it pleasingly ironic that my very first viewing of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was colourless, just like the people who originally tuned in to watch it on the television 25 years earlier. Dad took the video recorder back to the store to get a replacement and I was then able to rewatch \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" in colour. Unlike the viewers' anticipating its original broadcast in 1967, I had the benefit of watching the film for the first time knowing that it had not been well-received and had been saddled with a bad reputation for all these years. In other words, my expectations were allowed not to be high but I was still extremely excited to see 53 minutes of footage of the Beatles that I had never seen before but had onlyheard about. I could, and still can, understand how people would have been disappointed with the nonsensical aspect of it all, especially as there was no plot. The film consisted of segments, often very surreal ones, which had seemingly been `thrown' together. Indeed, most of it was improvised. Having said that, I love the \\"marathon\\" chase around the airfield in Kent and I think Victor Spinetti's incomprehensible army drill sergeant is brilliantly hilarious and the best of his three performances in the Beatles' films. Just as funny are the scenes between Ringo and his Aunt Jessie, played by Jessie Robins and I love the nighttime sharabang scenes where everyone's drinking and singing songs to an accordion accompaniment. Derek Royle and Ivor Cutler are terrific as Jolly Jimmy and Buster Bloodvessel respectively, and I wish the John Lennon-directed \\"Nat's Dream\\" scene of Nat Jackley as Happy Nat The Rubber Man chasing women around the Atlantic Hotel's outdoor swimming pool has been kept in the movie as it's a great little sequence, I think. It is included as a deleted scene on this 2012 DVD release of the film.<br /><br />The one thing I haven't yet mentioned about \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is perhaps the most important thing of all - the music. The six new Beatles' tracks featured in the film that formed the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" double EP are all wonderful and the film serves as a means of providing six little \\"music videos\\" for each of them. I've never been very keen on Paul's \\"Fool on the Hill\\", I have to admit, but I can appreciate its merit and why it's one of his most popular songs. The footage of him in France that was shot for the song's inclusion in the film is beautiful. Likewise, George's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" isn't a big favourite of mine but there's some wonderful, psychedelic projection art used by and for the camera to play over the song. Paul has said in retrospect that one example he uses in defending \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is the section with \\"I Am The Walrus\\", citing it to be the only chance to see John Lennon in fully psychedelic regalia performing the song with backup visuals of policemen and `eggheads'. It truly is a striking glimpse into John Lennon's beautifully baffling imagination from the summer of love period.<br /><br />It's strange how the Beatles' first failing should follow directly from what is widely believed to be their greatest achievement, the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album. Paul has said that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was made more as an \\"art\\" film than a \\"proper\\", conventional film. I don't think people in 1967 were ready for something like that, particularly from the Beatles, but I enjoy watching it from time to time. I think it has to be said that it would have been better had a plot been thought through for it and a script written but, as I've mentioned, there are plenty of delightful little moments to make it entertaining enough.heard about.

1400069289|5.0|I would like book 6 stars if I could. This book is well researched and provides great examples for how habits impact our personal and professional lives. Understanding how habits work is extremely insightful. I felt as I was reading the book I was learning some secret code on how to overcome bad habits and start new ones. Overall the book is a must read and a real motivator to improve your own habits.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Sounds like a good idea but doesn't really work. You need a lot of patience... Which I have so I would say a LOT. The bottles cut jagged edges and tipped back and forth when set on a flat counter.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack is well made and provides plenty of room for your camera and accessories.  I have a SLR with two lenses, my point and shoot, and accessories with plenty of extra room.  I also like the added straps on the side for a tripod.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but I found it slow, (Unlike Cuckoo Calling, Robert Galbraith aka JK Rowling) It had a good moral but I felt a bit let down with the end.

B009UNGYHG|3.0|NICE TO HAVE A CASE TO PLAVE BLUETOOTH IN WHEN NOT NEEDED WISH THAT IT HAD A LOCK ON IT SO THAT I DIDN'T RISK IT COMING OPEN IN PURSE OR BAG. ALSO NOT REAL CLEAR IF IT IS CHARGED OR CHARGING AND DOESN'T SEEM VERY ACCURATE THAT WAY.
B00B3N4CWK|5.0|I thought it was a great movie for the time period.  A fan of all the actors so that made it even better.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is the best book<br /> ever I loved reading the book the wonderful wizard of oz I recommend this book to everyone
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I thought this movie is a great movie series , does anyone know is they will follow with another movie from the books ?
B007MDB71O|5.0|A truly stunning piece of film making. Disney's John Carter takes on the daunting task of trying to adapt sci-fi icon Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 novel, A Princess of Mars, into a 3D modern blockbuster. Not an easy task for a family-friendly studio when the book in is a mix of century-old sci-fi tropes, violence, skin-baring costumes and bizarre alien creatures. It's even more of a challenge for director Andrew Stanton, who has only helmed animated features like Finding Nemo and WALL*E.<br />For his first live action role this film is 'top drawer' once you get past the uneven pacing.<br />It has a loyal band of followers on facebook and the web absolutely screaming out for a sequel.<br />This film is likely to reach cult status like blade runner and the wizard of oz.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I started watching Suits a few months ago and was hooked.  Of course I wanted to see it from day one to see how the actors got to where they were when I started watching. When I saw that the prior seasons became available on Amazon Prime, I decided to watch the prior episodes, marathon style.  Being able to see each episode, back to back, is the best.  The current season is on USA, one of their original series.  Well done USA.<br /><br />The show is about a prestigious law office in New York.  The main players are Harvey and Mike.  Harvey is a seasoned lawyer, called the closer in the company.  Mike has a photographic memory and knows the law like no one else.  All of the character development is top notch.  I highly recommend this show.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Dredd is a well done action movie and is often compared to The Raid: Redemption.  I do agree there are similarities, maybe even the same story, but Karl Urban does a great job humanizing Judge Dredd despite him having to wear the uniform and helmet throughout the film.  If you take the dystopian darkness of The Road Warrior, the over the top action of The Expendables (R rated version) and the dark humor of Robocop you'll get an idea of what this movie is about.  Granted they need more Robocop humor in Dredd 2.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this no holds bar take on an action movie.<br /><br />Fair Warning: There is plenty of slow-motion graphic violence and general disregard for human life.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Brings the massive tragedy of the tsunami down to a personal level--basically the story of one family and their survival and eventual reunion.When there are so many thousands of people killed or bereaved by such a cataclysmic event, the sheer numbers of dead and grieving overwhelm us, but when we are confronted with a smaller group, perhaps the effect of such a tragedy on one family, then I, at least, can better comprehend the kind of endurance of both mind and body required by my fellows who have surmounted such disasters throughout our tumultuous history.<br /><br />The film portion dealing with the sudden onslaught of the ocean was properly terrifying, as well as the accompanying underwater struggles of the people caught rolling among the broken bits of resort and landscape in its forces. Some of the dialog seemed a bit melodramatic, but how many of us find the &#34;right thing&#34; to say when tragedy strikes?
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book gives an incredible insight into presidents distant past and present and how they bond and what they come to think of each other and how it affects some outcomes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. It gives me something to do all the time. And it also lets me be creative.
B0053KWDES|4.0|This thing does as advertised. It brings my sennheiser headphones to life. almost makes them worth what I paid for them. Only problem I have is that it's such a pain to use this. You have extra wires and an extra box the size of extra gum packet to carry just for extra volume. Annoying
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found the inner dialogue or journaling too tedious to read, and I didn't like the characters.  I read it until the<br />bitter end because my sister kept telling me how much she loved it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I believe long reviews are tedious, so my recommendation is short and succinct.<br /><br />If you like:<br /><br />A.  Dragons<br />B.  Feudalism<br />C.  Knights<br />D.  Pirates<br />E.  All of the Above<br /><br />Then this book is awesome.  The whole series, epic.  Buy it, read it and then come back to Amazon and rate it.  :~)
B00DCX08MW|4.0|I wish there were more levels offered for free. The free levels are basic and do not really have any combat features within them; they just focus on landing on fields and aircraft carriers. However, the graphics are really nice.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I read this for a book group and to be honest, I was really leery. Turned out I had nothing to worry about! Great book!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very handy app. Easy to use format and good features for the casual user. I have used the print dictionaries before from this publisher and this app does not disappoint.
B00942Y4IY|2.0|Ok story with a few exciting points, but not gripping or one I would want to see again.  The set was pretty tacky.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its pretty fun it gets pretty hard though put other than that its a good game i hope you like it
B0058VW36U|1.0|This is a kids game, I even told it my age was 7 years old before I started playing it, and yet it constantly gave me opportunities to by more games from ZaptoLabs, which as a parent is not good, I know there is some security measures but thats not the point. It's a kids game that is meant to be played by kids, and that means no inapp purchasing by kids, they could at least put something in the app itself that requires a password, and not rely on your general app settings in the amazon app store.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|Only very recently introduced to TTB, but I love them and their new CD did not disappoint!  Love Susan's voice!!!
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Enjoyed the show from the very beginning! The cast is so on point. If they toned down the sex even better. It would make Sheldon happier. The new additions of Amy and Raj's girlfriend a hoot.
B006PAV1XO|1.0|This movie had very little plot driving it. It was slow from start to...well I didn't make it to the finish. I expected a faster-paced, funnier movie. Not worth my time.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I give this rating because there is a lot of action and humor as well. It was very impressive see all those actors in one movie. A+
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I love this movie! And it was even better because I got to watch it on my IPad at work.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was a nice film. It isn't non-stop action, so if you need that to enjoy a film look elsewhere. But it is a good story and Cruise does a very good job with the material. Direction, cinematography and effects made an overall good film. I would actually like to have seen it a bit longer for more character development.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is 40 is a great film.  It's not just good for people of this age.  It's also for people that have been together for a while.  Very relatable and funny!
0525478817|5.0|Love this novel so much that I ordered copies for my cousins and best friends! Can't wait to give them away!
0060589469|5.0|I've purchased this as yet another gift. I've given probably 10 copies of this book to friends and had to replace my own un-returned copy. I love it as do the recipients. Mind you, I believe this was written back in the late 60's; you'll find it quite 'heady'. I highly recommend it, incase you missed that.<br />Book arrived quickly in good shape. Packaged appropriately. A bit 'yellowed', I was expecting brand new but no worries. This one goes off to New Zealand.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I need the last one!!! Have to wait till October...NOOOOOO!!! Why can't it be out sooner than that!! It's not fair!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just found this app yesterday. So far it's fun, passes time and doesn't take much mental effort. I'm an adult learner and don't have a lot of extra time so it works for a short mental break between classes or on short breaks.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A really long and slow read, I would rather yelp someone to wait for the movie than to read this.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Enjoyed this book. The characters were well defined and the story line kept the reader guessing. I would recommend reading it.

B0058VW36U|2.0|This was already the FAOD once before and it is worse now because of the ads.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From the period props to the excellent acting - could not stop seeing it! Can't wait for the next season. The writing and plot lines are exciting and ...thank God you can understand the English. Just enough to stay connected. this is not something I would normally follow. My writer sister told me it was going to be another West Wing wow. She was right. Wonderful writing. The story is very engaging and keeps you on your mental toes all the time. This constant play of classes keeps it shifting emotionally through the twisting plot lines.  WELL DONE BRITS !

B001GA1RFA|5.0|This book is about Colin Singleton and a road trip he takes after he graduates from high school.  He is on the road with his best friend  Hassan.  They find jobs in Tennessee and he meets a great girl who is not named Katherine.  I liked it a lot.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I didn't know!  &#34;The Code Talkers.&#34;  The what?  How the #*!@ did I not know about this?  More importantly, how the !#$% did our government not celebrate everything accomplished by our Native American brethren and all they brought to the battle field to save our self-righteous asses???<br /><br />Good movie?  Yes!  Did Nicolas Cage get too much focus?  No, he did NOT!  I saw a review that took that stance and I so disagree.  He did a good job of depicting the attitude of that time and the horrid circumstances our soldiers all had to endure.<br /><br />It was important to fully understand that attitude to better understand just what the Navajo (and other tribes) were up against as they stood side by side with their fellow Americans!<br /><br />Did Nicolas Cage get the limelight?  Um, duh!  It's Hollywood!  That focus on Cage was no surprise!  I personally don't think it took away from the story this movie had to tell.<br /><br />My only negative?  It felt incomplete -- like there were too many corners cut for this film.  Again, that's Hollywood.  I think they could have done better with the back story for both of the main characters.<br /><br />If you don't know the story, you have missed an essential part of American history!  So did I.  Why?  Because it wasn't politically convenient to let some of our war heroes take the credit they deserved.  Politics and the racial/cultural prejudice we try to deny, or disguise -- pfff!<br /><br />This is just another reason to love the Native American people and the beauty found in them and in their culture.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will forgive me being so verbally animated and edgy but at least they know I liked it!  :)
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I wanted ALL of the special features. In a single package. Paramount, feel free to let me know when you offer it. Until then, laterz, 'cause I any buying it piecemeal.
B0094AH3MU|4.0|The DVD is not apt to win any prizes for excellence of performance or engineering, but it offers an opportunity for completists like myself to see a performance of a Verdi opera that is rarely performed. it's fun to see how the greatest Italian opera composer of the nineteenth century interpreted the work of Friederich Schiller, one of the greatest German playwrights of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.The modest production is suitable and the singers are good, if not great. I enjoyed it and I'm happy to have it, making my video collection of all the Verdi operas complete after years of collecting them.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.  I never tire of it.  The plot may be a re-hash of other stories and movies but the way this one is done is unique.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|It is basic with no frills, effectively does what it is intended to do without distracting bells and whistles. It would be nice if the reminder was removed as soon as it is marked as complete.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great puzzles to solve.  anxious for more to come.  it really helps exercise your brain.  I hope we don't wait too long for the updates and new puzzles.
B009P3N1GI|4.0|I purchased this story because it was nominated for Hugo in novella category, and I don't regret it. Main character, a girl who has unique ability to carve souls stones which can be then used to rewrite history of any object, is caught and forced to stamp (rewrite) soul back to the body of assassinated emperor. The act itself seems to be impossible not mentioning that she has only 100 days to achieve it. Will she meet the target? Read it yourself.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|Very good and practical advice for today's corporate world especially for those in transition between different levels or transitioning to a new job in the same company. Being successful at a new job in the same company is often very challenging because your prior reputation often precedes you. This book gives good advice on steps one can take to change perceptions.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far I'm really enjoying the game. I am giving it 4 stars for now, I just started playing and am interested to see if they stick with the typical &quot;free game&quot; trap of having to buy items or asking for help to move on.
B00CBDCB0G|5.0|I loved the small English village setting-the time era!<br />Very interesting to have the story told from a narative . . .<br />and it's not Poirot telling it!<br />Can't wait to start the next!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|If you are searching for the Lion King, there are several versions, this one was great. Certainly, a Disney classic, which children love over and over.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners is an epic tale about a Jewish family living in Bratislava, and the environs in the years running up to WW2 and beyond.  It is much more than a holocaust story - it is an account of how Hitler's Nazi propaganda came to be regarded as the truth, how people started to behave as a result and the total upheaval which accompanied the war and the aftermath.<br /><br />Fischer gives an account of the history and this is mirrored by the actions of the characters.  This provides a powerful undercurrent of bullying, helplessness and cruelty  - making a strong impression for the reader - which lingers. But there are moments of joy and extreme bravery as we learn about the risks that people took to help  each other, as the protagonists journey across Europe.<br /><br />The book has a real feeling of the period, and this is down to the depiction of the characters, their speech and they way they think.  There is also just the right amount of historical detail to inform the reader of the context and bring the story to life - a story which educates and raises questions about morality and decency in everyday life.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for lovers of historical fiction.
B000008LOV|5.0|If you want a great supergroup, tough to beat the Traveling Wilburys. They would be very current in the now popular folk tinged music. What a group of talent, imagine Bob Dylan seeking backup to Roy Orbison, awesome.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a well-written approach to experimenting with and using the law of attraction. If nothing else, it's a really interesting read!  Enjoy!!!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|There is some intrigue and tongue in cheek humor here. The hooded Klan scene is right out of Mel Brooks. The stage coach with the giant tooth on top is whimsical. The plot was intriguing and the acting was quite good.  Unfortunately, the last half hour is a pointless blood splatter fest which is defended as classic Tarantino. I'm not sure why all the critics see such explicit violence as great entertainment. QT put it in there because he could.  Brains splattered on the wall is the usual &#34;money shot.&#34;
B002ZM74Y6|3.0|The movie was okay, but the language was a bit much, I'm not snobbish i can cuss with the best , but this movie had way to much.
B007R108WA|4.0|Keeps you interested, and entertained, not to busy to where you lose track of what's going on, but just a tad bit long
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I think all the good parts were shown on previews, I was disappointed in this picture could have been better.
B00439MV42|5.0|Great family movie! Need more of them like this. Suspend 'reality' for an hour and a half with this time travel comedy.
B008Y73940|5.0|Chose this movie on a whim and glad I did.<br />Twists, turns and solid acting performances by all.<br />Worth the rental!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|The story is fantastic in this original movie.. I'm not a big fan of the next movies or spin-off shows though personally. The characters have a depth of emotion and each has a solid background so you feel like you know them. The alien guy is also sexy.. and I so want one of those healing beds.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app it helps me a lot when i wanna look cute a&ntilde;dd I was bumming that day so.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Watched this with my 12 and 7 year old, I would say it was entertaining. If you are very sensitive about what your child watches please keep in mind there are places where people are eaten and killed in various ways in this movie.. though it really doesn't show much.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|This was a fanastic cd. Received promptly and in great shape. Have played continuously since receiving.<br />Even had to lend it to my friend.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I bought this film for my Son in law, who is also a great Ayrton Senna fan, and I loved it so much when I saw it.  It is a true documentary, fair, unbiased, for one of the greatest F-1 drivers ever.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game! If you take your time playing it is also free. It has many levels and lots of challenges.
1475143389|5.0|Bigger, Leaner, Stronger is definitely the most legit fitness book I have ever read. As a lifter who has been listening to &#34;bro&#34; science, I can honestly say I haven't been getting as many gains as I should, and have been left with a lot of questions.<br /><br />This book goes into deep detail about many topics. From Dieting, Cardio, to lifting. I was laughing throughout the book, because the book literally striped all of the false information that I have picked up from bro science, and gave me the right information. It was fantastic. I can tell while reading the information that it's just... right. He gives plenty of research studies throughout the book to prove his data.<br /><br />I am going to go do the workout regimen/diet that was given to me from the book, and come back in a month or two and teak my review.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Best gangster movie EVER...especially On BLURAY. If you never watched this before then today is the day.....Don't neglect yourself.<br />:)
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Great movie. Great cast and a wonderful story. Very touching story. A great story. I recommend it highly and without reservation.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. There was passion in this movie which helped me to give it 5 stars. I enjoyed seeing the banal character invoke human passion.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is one of the best book I've ever read. I'm buying the second one now. Great Great Great book!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son loves Iron Man and this app is really fun for him.  He gets to make his favorite hero do things.
B009IF82SK|5.0|I enjoyed watching that episode. The quality of the video was great and I'll probably use Amazon to stream more videos of my favorite shows.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I LOVE this book! Im about halfway through and every exercise has worked 100% for me. Im sharing this with everyone I know with an open mind...and those who need an open mind! :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|wow this is a really good game its way better then other games everyone should get this game its wonderful
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|If you watch movies to observe directing techniques...(some people do) then you will like is for that. The story is a bit difficult to follow...and philosophical, but if you watch it twice you'll probably get it. Again the philosophy, the directing and the interesting landscapes are what this movie is about.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Great Animation,  they really brought to life the chameleon without loosing its natural animal features.<br />Some of the jokes and sub-context was for adults but it was not inappropriate for small children.<br />A very good lesson was learned at the end and everyone in my house enjoyed the movie.
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|Restored video to my tablet.  I had lost all video and audio.  Still working on audio, though.  Easy to use
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I remember enjoying this movie with my friends and siblings growing up and now 20 years later my son loves it too. Great film!
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Allowed me to see some video.  Locked up though at times.  unable to get my audio working, though.  OK product
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Can't put down this awesome continuation of the saga.  I am eagerly awaiting the publication of book six. Keep it up Mr. G. R.R. Martin!!
0312370849|5.0|heart wrenching story love that time period.  She is a great writer and really pulls on your heart strings. (
B001P06GX4|5.0|We love it. It's good for the whole family. I really recommend it. We had very good times playing with it.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Great movie.  Have given it as gifts to dog lovers.  The closeness of the dog and Richard was unbelievable.  Great!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Too bad the movie wasn't better, but it was ok.  I thought at times I was watching a cartoon with so many oversized masked characters, or maybe a Wrestling Match with the Masked Avenger. . . Let the kids watch it unless they are scared by bullets and rockets and occasionally bad acting.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This was a really good movie! Fast paced and very compelling. Matthew McConaughey did a great job. I would highly recommend this.
B008B3GP2A|3.0|I saw them in concert last September and was amazed that they sounded so great live! I wanted to give them a chance to redeem themselves because the previous album wasn't my favorite either. Songs About Jane so far is my  favorite. I definitely liked them better when they were small and not so well known. Adam is now everywhere, they have changed band members, the commercialism of pop is stripping them of their talent by having all these guest \\"talent\\" on songs. Adam has a great voice. I hope soon he will leave The Voice and focus on the MUSIC again. Beautiful Goodbye, Sad, and Wipe Your Eyes showcase the talent we all love so please, please spare us the mash-ups and remixes!
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing it again after all of these years.  When the new one was released this past week, I rented it.  I liked the original most of all.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|the ball moves too slowly and does not really accelerate, so the game is just very slow to play and not challenging at all
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a very  interesting book. It will help you understand how habits work, and how to implement them successfully. I Loved learning about the history of Febreeze and how it almost failed!
B00486070K|5.0|I have an older hackintosh from 2010 with OS 10.6. I was having issues with my built in Ethernet and the wireless Ethernet was giving me issues with Synergy, a program used to share my Windows keyboard and mouse with my hackintosh. This Apple adapter is a little expensive, but hackintosh computers can be very picky so I spent the extra money on the Apple brand.<br /><br />Not only does this adapter work by simply plugging the device in the hackintosh, it fixed all my connection issues and transfers data very well. I now have no issues with my internet or Synergy thanks to this little device. It is very well built and durable too.<br /><br />A 5 star product in my book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was reluctant to read this because I thought I would never enjoy this novel as much as I had his others.  I just figured he had to come up with a lemon sooner or later and I felt this would be the one.  I was wrong.  Elegant.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I bought this soundtrack, but I knew it had won multiple awards and had good reviews from others.  There are some really catchy songs in the soundtrack, but there are also some really beautiful and heart touching ones.<br />Cyndi Lauper did a great job on the music and I was surprised by the variety of the music.  It doesn't shout \\"Cyndi Lauper\\" to me but it only helps showcase her talent and versatility.<br />I highly recommend this to any fan of Broadway Musicals.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Compare to the other GI, I think this on it's just ok... much more needed to be done for the movie to exceed.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Still a great movie.  Purchased it for my kids to watch and they liked it too :)  Had a couple small hiccups in the streaming of the video but nothing major.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really like the book, more than the movie. Much more detailed, and entertaining, then the movie. Getting ready for book two.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it! Top notch drama from top notch team assembled by Julian Fellowes. Must watch television now always and forever
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Excellent story.  Music is beautiful.  A true story with much sadness but a beautiful ending.  I passed it on to a friend that has been waiting to watch it for years.  They immediately ordered a copy for their DVD collection.<br /><br />The aspect of this film that I liked.  The Polish piano player's will to live was impressive.  His ability to play beautiful music at a time of great struggle, fear of losing his life, and having already lost his entire family was moving beyond words.  His courage was amazing.<br /><br />I would compare  Meryl Streep in the Holocaust.  Another good movie, however, much darker.<br /><br />The film was a great impact just as other before it.<br /><br />When considering this film, know that the artistry, history, and story are worth you time and investment.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, I recommend this movie with the top actors performing. Very exciting, keep you on the edge of your seat with action pack.
0307277887|4.0|After watching the series first, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But I was pleasantly surprised that the book took a different route than the show.  Characters were different - their personalities, their relationships and even their fates differ from the show.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Dexter, the show, and have yet to read the book, give it a chance.  It's a great experience and perspective change.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is very easy to understand and it consumes most of your time to see what is next...five stars from me...
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I got this for myself, like playing with it, but the grandkids found it on my kindle and love it.  They like getting graded, so they keep playing to get better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes u use your brain<br />A highly recommended game for those who love a challenge. It's free and a real brain teaser.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Great movie! Watched this movie for American Film, and feel that i missed out so many years ago. Loved it
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Very easy to use.Any one should be able to produce lots of wonderful, fun effects. Works very well on my Samsung tablet.Very impressed with it in general
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Its an awesome app if you like to photo edit stuff this is the app you should use.it's an amazing fun app.I love it
B008IGP8RI|5.0|This CD was perfect for the person that loved the movie Lawless! Loved all of the songs but two of them..Perfect choice again! I would recommend this CD very highly!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok. Not as good as I thought it would be after all the hype. Felt like a teen novel with a lot of sex.
6302492815|1.0|I bought this movie on VHS a while back for about a buck. I don't know much about the so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" - only that the new scenes from the original Boogeyman 2 are sped up or shown in B&W with the director mumbling the story by reading from a script. I agree. That sounds stupid!! I will not buy that version.<br /><br />However, I wish I hadn't bought the VHS version either! It is total garbage and was obviously made by the director to mock and ridicule Hollywood! Paramount wanted to make a sequel to the first movie with a bigger budget but Ulli Lommel refused and made the sequel independently. BIG MISTAKE!!! This sequel and the next one (Return of the Boogeyman) both suck!!<br /><br />Both sequels should be pulled from distribution and Mr. Lommel should sell the rights to a big studio and they should make a decent follow-up to Lommel's masterpiece! Too much pride gets you nowhere! And this is a perfect example! Just think what Boogeyman 2 would have been if Paramount got a hold of it! It would have been memorable!<br /><br />At least one movie came out of all this. The original 1980 Boogeyman! By far, the best of the series. 200% better than the sequels! But that's just my opinion.
B005ZUR724|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best mmorpg out there in the amazon app store. I've played Pocket Legends, Avabel, and midgard rising extensively but this game is by far superior in gameplay and replayability. Although there are a few glitches and lag issues, the problems are well worth the hassle. The price, at $7, is a bit much but, seriously, what other alternatives do kindle fire users really have at a decent mmo?<br /><br />On a side note, I have one question. Are the kindle fire O&amp;C servers separate from android users? I am asking because a friend of mine would like to play with me but she has an android tablet. An answer would be much appreciated.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Wooooooooooooot I need season 3 now. Kind of sucks in that aspect, it sucked me in. But it's so good.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Loved the book<br />Had good success with the experiments<br />- it took longer than 48 hours though.<br /><br />Still working through the other experiments, am sure will see results .<br /><br />Love the price of the kindle version of the book- very reasonably priced.<br />Wisdom and practical advice at low cost.. Total winner!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging without  being frustrating!  Very diverting when you just want to relax with a game that is not too easy and not too difficult.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Great movie one of my faves Could watch this,over and over and it still tears me up every time!! Love love it
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I had a hard time figuring out what the book was all about.  Granted it was  a memory, or fantasy, about something that happened, or maybe happened, but I just didn't get it.
B00BR9XJTW|5.0|My grandson, age 3, loves this book.  It will stand up on its own and the big pages are filled with the best of Richard Scarry, including Lowly Worm.  I enjoy it as much as he does!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A great story that is genuinely scary at times. Wonderful characters.It really takes the reader to another world and dimension.
B004VPAXHU|3.0|I selected specifically the version of this CD which included the bonus tracks, which the CD I received does not contain, so while it is a good album, it is not at all what I ordered. Beware!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Starring the always wonderful David Tenant, Broadchurch follows in the tradition of  the Prime Suspect series. Great story, lots of twists and turns. Waiting anxiously for the next episode
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It was a real eye opener to see a glimpse of the horrific life circumstances of so many people suffering from these terrible disasters. The Red Cross does amazing work and the film helped me to understand how a donation to these disasters, no matter how small, can help others.  Such fine writing and acting and I have to say it certainly made me a fan of Naomi Watts, who should have won last years Oscar.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|\\"While this isn't Edward Scissorhands or Corpse Bride, this serves as a good reminder of everything in popcorn cinema that is humourous, off-the-beaten-path, and gothic as Dark Shadows. While the story suffers from several holes, it all works together especially with Johnny Depp's role and its supporting cast. Better than Twilight and Alice in Wonderland and in line with the 1992 Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Tongue-in-cheek and dry sense of humour (especially from Depp's character). Depp's acting chomps. Scenery and set design. Some of the supporting work (esp. from the shy girl, Hit Girl/Chloe Moretz, and Bonham Carter). A touching ending and prologue.<br /><br />CON: Storyline and its execution. Plotholes throughout and pacing is a tad inconsistent. Green could be a little less of a stereotype/cliche.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's the Downton Abbey you love from PBS in the original uncut BBC format with scenes and shots left out of the American version.  If you saw this on Masterpiece when it first aired, it's just different enough to make it worth your while to watch it all over again.  If you have never seen this in HD you really owe it to yourself to experience the glorious details of the period costumes and magnificent Highclere Castle in the HD format. Jolly Good!
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|\\"The complex social dynamics, bare-bones realism, and the conflict within their characters makes for good study in Film Studies 101 and so does this Considine debut here which ticks all the plus points in a gritty and effective yet disturbing drama about internal and external trouble, violence, and torment in dreary old North Yorkshire. Think Gran Torino but with more c-words and less humour but more directorial psychoanalysis.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Performances from Mullan, Colman, and Marsan. Cinematography. Location and choice of color and design. Screenplay techniques and writing. Realism and conflict of its character.<br /><br />CON: Some points of reference fluster (i.e. police, crime).
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Ordered the book thinking it was going to be a great read.  Very slow going, drags and drags.  Finished it just because I bought it.
B005JE7WKI|2.0|\\"After watching one of 2012's best films so far, The Cabin in the Woods, and previous types like Shaun of the Dead, The Evil Dead, and ParaNorman this came not of much a surprise as it were moreover another foundation into the horror pastiche/cult film experience.<br /><br />First and foremost, knowing that it was a Canadian spoof would only conjure up images of 'huh?' but Tucker & Dale works pretty well for the most part like a well-done college film. The special effects, dialogue, and length of time aren't all that stellar but you don't need to take that into consideration for a film like this. To some, it maybe perfect and pretty \\"out-there\\", in a good way, when you watch it without thinking about it.<br /><br />The twist of the genre with the college kids causing havoc and the leader's paranoia only manifests a higher splurge of laughter and intrigue into how will thinks go. The climax, cheesy/nonsense attitude, and the subtlety in its humour and use of irony, that follow on the same vein as The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episodes or an [adult swim] 10-minute sketch, are alright here and making you on the edge of the seat at times knowing what will happen to Dale when he meets a klutzy girl. It does skim over a few parts due to its short length and some of the dialogues between T&D do go a little more than necessary.<br /><br />Don't expect, just like Cabin in the Woods or Prometheus for that matter, when you go into the film because that in the end will determine whether you like this or not!\\"
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Not to be missed. This series continues to surprise and create fine entertain ain't, the characters are believable and wonderful.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The puzzles in the game are pretty good - some of them even challenging.  But there's an ongoing story line and dialogue that tries my patience.  There's a choice in the set up to turn off the dialogue but you have to turn it off for each puzzle...
B004U7JYXS|1.0|All of the film came out blank & when it arrived the box was destroyed. The picture would only come out in the corner of all fifty films. Don't waste your time!
1416955070|4.0|I read this book because my friend swore it was amazing and life-changing of The Fault in Our Stars proportions. Alas, it just left me feeling squirmy and a little awkward.<br />The beginning was pretty typical of paranormal YA- girl is friend zoning nice boy, girl encounters disaster, girl meets scary hot boy, boy takes girl to his secret lair. I didn't really mind. It was kind of nice, actually, because I'd just finished the Hush Hush series and Clary (weird name aside) was pretty cool.<br />This book continued to gain strength with Alec and Isabelle's introduction (gotta love the gay Shadowhunters) and Hodge was okay. This may have been the peak of the book.<br />I was fine with the Clary/Jace pairing. At least (Tobias and Tris, Gale and Katniss, I am glaring at you) their age was similar. Jace let Clary fight (now we turn to Patch from Hush Hush) and they made a good team. It was nice that Simon didn't sit in the corner and cry, then forgive Clary two milliseconds later. It was nice that there were rivals for both halves of the relationship. It was nice that there was plot development (though not much character development for dear Clary; Jace got a bit though). The middle kinda rocked.<br />Then, the terrible, terrible end. The same end that had me screaming \\"WHY?!\\" at the friend who recommended this book and left me too in shock to remember not to walk into doors. This isn't good, though it sounds like it.<br />This sounded awesome: Clary and Jace kick Valentine butt! Hooray! Action (something everything I read nowadays lacks)! I still don't know how something so promising went so wrong. Oh, wait. I do.<br />These godawful incestuous relationships.<br />Clary runs into the room Jace is in, and a reunion ensues. Yay! Jace is back. Suddenly Jace becomes cranky and weird. Boo! This makes no sense. So Clary asks her betrothed why he's so mad. The answer? \\"Hey, Clary, you know Valentine? He's my dad.\\" \\"But he's MY dad, Jace.\\" \\"Poor you. Guess you have to share.\\" *mutters about only children*<br />I guess this is a good twist? It's kind of creeping me out. I spent close to 500 pages waiting for something awesome to happen with this pairing, and I am rewarded with the discovery that it is incestuous? I cannot express enough how DISTURBING this is.<br />All of this is so creepy.<br />I've heard that maybe some dude named after a crab is her brother, too, and I think she and Jace fix everything eventually, but really? I can't even reread any sentences with the words \\"Clary\\" and \\"Jace\\" because it will just make me shudder.<br />I gave it a four because I loved the middle so much. Had the ending not happened the way it did, maybe this book would go up next to Legend on my YA book list. But this is just wrong. I wish I could unread the end.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It immerses you in the daily life of an elite navy seal. It takes you to a journey that makes you think about you own life, the horrors of war, the minds of the kids witnessing death, the loss of your friends.<br />There is also an interesting, maybe minor, but unfulfilled promise from the current president of the United States.

B003U53GK8|5.0|I loved all of lost, but season 6 pulled it all together and answered alot of questions .It was great that they included so many of the people that had small parts through out the seasons in the last few shows
B00E193TM2|5.0|Reminds me of Way of the Fist, hard riffs, killer drums, and eclectic songs.  Dot Your Eye's and the cover of Mama Said Knock You Out are the tops so far.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I thought that this was going to be really funny, but it was strange and disjointed.  The relationship was not very credible, and it was crass.

B004EPYZSK|3.0|After viewing it on cable a few times, I decided that I did like the movie.  Olivia Wilde is beautiful, as well as Abigail Spencer.  The humanity of the story is what finally captured me.
B00C6B9PX4|4.0|Watching this movie in blu ray wasn't what I hoped for.  The movie looks cheezy, but who doesn't love scarface!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. I like it a lot. You should play it.  It is free and entertaining.  It is a Good time.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Did the job just fine. Nice product. Very easy to use. Simple to understand directions. Nice size screen for viewing.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My 3-year old is very much into princesses right now and she loves this movie just as much as I did as a child.  Only downside of this order was that the product itself, the DVD, always skips at one point in the movie and did that from the very first time we used it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun and entertaining<br />Clean and neat design<br />Addictive and enjoyable<br />Fast pase action<br />Simple yet very challenging<br />Overall excellent game

B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Words cannot describe this waste of time, money and effort. A terrible script and poor directing on so many levels. The original was 100x better. I didn't care about any one particular character at all. If you want great horror go see The Conjuring. This film was not a film but a poor excuse for using hundreds of blood squibs. No story. No humor.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|First of all I am not your \\"usual\\" fan of music. I have been especially a metal fan for nearly 25 years. And my favorite bands in that genre are Metallica GNR and Pantera. I also love Death Metal, and Hair Metal and pretty much every type. And I have been listening to Hail The King all day. And I can tell you it is truly amazing. It made me smile from the very opener \\"Sheperd Of Fire\\". Alot of new metal releases have a few tracks that are good and the rest are filler. And I very fairly now get my heart racing over just the opening track. And yes they are taking some infleunces and bringing them in. And honestly I love it. I love seeing a new metal band that really brings the past with them. \\"Hail to the king\\" Honestly reminds of me of Appetite For Destruction. And I do not say that lightly. I got into GNR when I was 8 years old. So please ignore all the negativity and give this an honest listen.
B009KCUX3S|1.0|This books is a joke, litarally. The humor that is in this book is non stop and takes away from your learning of the material.  I dont recommend. Get Java, a beginners guide by oracle much better
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Great movie great performances I loved every single minute of it. I could watch it every day if I could
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you love Nicholas Sparks books, you will love this one! Much better than the movie so read the book first.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My three grandchildren love this game. And even though its the free version, I don't have those irritating pop ups
B0054NQZ9S|5.0|The truth is that this movie was very good and so true in america,  I bought the movie to let my close friends see it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great way to pass time when I'm waiting somewhere. I do not have to have Internet to play this game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great. It is a good stress reliever. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.
140006922X|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time. I loved every bit of it. I highly recommend reading it.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Liked it better than the Wizard of Oz.  It is wonderfully funny, sarcastic and silly....Should have won an Oscar. Excellent movie, but only for 13 year old or older.....it is a coming of age movie, love story between two young teenagers on an island of dysfunctional adults, in a unfair world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter and I love this game!  We play hours together on Minecraft!!  Its cool how we can play together on different devices but be on the same game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Loved it on Games.com but this version on my Kindle is even better. In fact, I am going to have to discipline myself to read more and play less of Fairway. (lol)
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This app was a waste of time.  It did not work for my Kindle Fire.  I was really hoping that this app would work but was very disappointed.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|This one definitely did not live up to expectations.  The previous movies were much better.  The interaction between Sam and the Autobots just seemed stunted and there was a serious lack of dialogue with them.<br /><br />Not really sure what was going with Sam and his new GF.  No real back story or history as to what happened to Mikaela.  Just seemed to be thrown in there to make up for the lack of the actress I guess.<br /><br />Overall, Not impressed.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Best book I've read this year. Very detailed with good analysis, Reza Aslan is a scholar. He gives a very plausible view on Jesus ands the foundations of Christianity. The references alone are worth the purchase. Keep a bible handy.
B0009VJWKY|5.0|I absolutely think this album is one of the best I have heard in a long time.  I started out listening to Lindsey Sterling, a friend recommended Bond, I checked them out on youtube and went and ordered this album after watching 2 videos.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|Love love love it. Watch it every chance I get. Now I can watch all eight of them have a Harry potter day
B003JHKORK|4.0|I initially discovered this series because Pierce Brosnan is in the movie. The books are excellent and the movie is fun and I can watch it with my 8 and 10 year old niece and nephew AND not worry about the content.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I am hooked on this series and can't wait until the next season comes out. British really know how to make films.
0694003611|5.0|My son loves the contrast between the black and white pages and the full color pages.  Good visual stimulation.  Although he is still too young (7 months) I think as he gets older finding the different items on each of the pages will add more depth to story time.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Caught this on cable a week ago, commercial-free, and didn't move for two hours.  Amazing documentary that makes you lament our obsession with technology.  The passion these musicians have and joy the take in their work is astounding.  Kudos to Dave Grohl for putting it together.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's great because of all the characters are so much like the movie and you can do so much in the game is never ending it keeps you coming back for more very exciting thanks for the game.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Style of writing not very interesting.  Just seems to present facts in a boring way.<br />Too much time spent in the beginning about training, etc., again, not very exciting.<br />A very exciting life of Chris, that is for sure.  Too bad the presentation was not so good.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|So I'm left with a cliff hanger and wondering what happens next. It's entertaining and keeps me turning the pages. A very good read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Really like it.  I like the values of that time and the characters are perfect.  Would like to see it come back.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|After watching how the whole ordeal played out, I found this to be a bit better than the second film yet the trailer was a bit deceptive.  A few new additions along with old, overall enjoyable
B007P6VM4A|2.0|I own all of the Hives CD's but this one was very disappointing. I will keep it in my collection, but I know for a fact that I will put on one of their other CD's before this one. This one will be gathering dust on my shelf.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I watch videos and listen to all the music with my family and everyone loved the sound and the picture.  Amazingly clear
1882723007|3.0|I'd like to believe this woman's experience was real.  I do believe there's something after this life but what about those that have not accepted Jesus as their saviour?  ie Jews or Agnostics.  Where do they go?<br />Also I found the writing to be pretty amateur.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I so thoroughly enjoy this album with what is for me such an original passionate style that is so moving. I enjoy every composition on this album. It is nothing less than amazing and spectacular. I do so very much look forward to more from this talented musician!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Others have noted Aslan's facility with the language, and it is indeed outstanding.  The clarity and directness of his prose makes the book a pleasure.  As he himself notes, his thesis is not new, and it is controversial.  What he does is express it, and document its support, about as well as one could possibly do.  He's not out to give the counter-arguments, so for the holes in his argument or the evidence for a different interpretation of Jesus, one must look elsewhere.  But that is not a criticism of the book, just an observation on its limitations.  All in all, I would highly recommend the book, even to those who already know that one strain of scholarship on Jesus's life puts him among the zealots; it is unlikely that case has been put better anywhere else.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Best two dollars I ever spent.  This is a must read in simple, easy phrasing with memorable metaphors to retrain yoru brain towards expectancy and winning.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great, I use this app daily. I have this app on all my devices, and I prefer the kindle fire version.
0811879542|4.0|I have to say that my initial impression after looking through the &#34;Press Here&#34; book was quite unfavorable.  It seemed so simplistic that my five-year old granddaugther would be equally disappointed after going through it the first time.  Her reaction was just the opposite, she loved it!  I am still unsure as to why, but when she visits each day we go through it again and again.  So much for what an old grandfather knows.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This was an awesome movie.  The story of redemption is so clear in this work.  I have seen more and more that many movies have this story in them.  I believe it is fundamentally the story of life.  We desire redemption.  This movie has a great story and a fun plot.  Clean and great for everyone.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Why I the world would someone buy an guide to an app they don't have?!?!? You need to get Candy Crush on this store or at least tell us you are TRYING to!
1936608898|5.0|This book is amazing and following the challenge I felt amazing! I highly recommend you read this book and implement the challenge today.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved Jack's voice.  It truly let the reader feel the emotions, the claustrophobia, the terror, the innocence, the confusion and the relief.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|Just started the series like the musical aspect of the show story line is pretty stereotype high school themes, as it is supposed to be a guess.  I will continue to watch as long as no extra cost above prime membership.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|Wow this was fun and easy for even me, the most technically challenged. I'm going to have fun with this. The red background grabs your eyes immediately. I think it's a riot that the color red adds to the irony you can create.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I watch Downton at end of season so I can watch all at once or space them out.  I held the lasts episode for 6 weeks knowing it would leave me hanging or sad.  can't wait for next set of shows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and the minions are so cute!  Every time I play this game I go BANANAS!!!!!!! (Pun intended)
1476727910|5.0|Funny, moving, insightful, uplifting, thought provoking... can you tell I loved it!?! After reading it when I learned the author had thought of the premise when dealing with panic disorder, knowing he'd dealt with something that can be so challenging (I work as a mental health counselor), made me have even more respect and appreciation for his perspectives and compassion towards the human race. Well done Mr. Haig!<br />Melanie Stone,<br />Author of [[ASIN:B00BUB0K2G My Journey from FAT: A Wellspring Story]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always loved solitaire, and this one is no exception. Love the fact that you can choose whether to have a winning round or try against the game. I am so addicted to this game my husband has taken up cooking and cleaning.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Its a ok, Its a weather  app, you can get a good information using this app works fine and a good speed
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It started out as if it were not going to be very good but actually ended up being a pretty good story.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Gets a little more difficult as you go along.  I like it!  Don't have to pay for anything if you have the patience to wait...one of my favorite  hidden object games
B00DU74U74|4.0|It was a really good movie! Keeps you interested thru the entire movie ! Thumbs up! Perfect for date night ;)
B001IMR7EQ|5.0|Been waiting YEARS to get this - missing a couple of tracks Planet Schmanet, Sword Of Damacles - but has certainly put a Rose Tint on my world and brought memories flooding back - now for the DVD.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|It's such an enjoyable read. As a physician, it will definitely affect my performance from racial bias to my decision making and how I manage my team. There's a lot to learn from the improv theatre and how to improve our ability to use our unconscious part of our brains.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This is a great deal for someone looking to make some minor improvement to a computer or iPod sound. Charging it can become cumbersome but the battery does last a long time. Cleans up the sound well. If you are looking to clean up and improve your sound but are no audiophile - get this.
B000I62JAK|1.0|So many pop culture references to this movie, and a friend (I usually respect) recommended it, but I felt this was a complete waste of my time. I wish I could have those minutes back, but I can't. Why did I even finish watching it?!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I found this to be the best book I have read in 30 years, and perhaps ever. I am not one to read chicklit, but having stumbled across Cheryl Strayed I find that she is in a classification all her own.  How easily she illustrates the epic human struggle we each face when battling our own inner demons and voices from out of the dark. She goes on to blaze a trail, both literally and figuratively, showing how she chose to answer those voices with a strident \\"I am here and I deserve to be here!\\". More than just a story of adventure,  it is also a story about taking what life dishes out and eating it up. About finding the connection we as human beings share with each other and to nature. An awesome book. A great story brilliantly told.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|5 stars for the look back at the making of the soundtrack of my childhood.<br />I may not like all the bands featured, but I loved the peeks at the behind-the-scenes of recording, sonic vignettes, interview clips and learning more about the lives of musicians, the engineers, the producers of the last bastion of analog days.<br /><br />It seems as if everyone and their mother has a digital audio recording setup now. I still have some analog gear but it sits by gathering dust. After seeing this, I will have to try put that tube gear and that warmth back in my future recordings.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This Mahjong game is very engaging and addictive. We can spend hours in a constructive manner. This Mahjong particularly has very good front end and overall appearance. Good one.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|GOT WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED LOVE THE SHOW CAN'T wAIT TO SEE SEASON SIX AWESOME CONDTION WORKS GREAT IN THE DVD PLAYER
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun game lots of levels great time killer would recommend to anyone lots of ways to play and run smooth though out the game so have a great time playing and see you on the battle field don't forget to build a strong army
B00005JKDR|5.0|WAS A GOOD MOVIE WAS IN A GOOD CONDTION WHEN I GOT IT PLAYS IN THE DVD PLAYER LOOKS NEW
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book! I know something dramatic is about to happen and cannot wait to see what it is!!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you are in any way familiar with the concept of the &#34;red shirt&#34; in Star Trek, you already know where this is going. However, it just keeps getting better.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really love the alarm clock...it's been awesome. Even though it's free, I like that it does give some songs to wake up to. I also love the weather feature.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Read this book! Creative and funny, I have since gone back and bought most of his books. the characters are really well drawn and the humor unexpected, dry, and laugh out loud funny.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just like the previous books in the series you simply can't put this one down once you've picked it up. I'm stuck for hours, completely engrossed.
B008Y7FQ6E|4.0|It starts slow, but the story becomes interesting as action grows  and it keeps you on your chair as it goes!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game! I love it... it's like owning your very own horse it is so fun plus it has great graphics.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Quite easy to use. Not loaded down with other things that are not needed. Installation was fast with easy to understand instructions.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved the clever yet poignant humour of the main character, who would be considered socially inept, yet has his own genius and makes his own valuable contribution to society.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I watched the first five or six episodes after watching a series I really liked called Lark Rise to Candleford. Just plain didn't like Downton Abby.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I luv this game I think that it so much better than temple run 1 I recommend this to every one who loves fun
B00ENIR864|1.0|no camera you cant scan I haven't even got it and I know it doesn't work only works on kindle fire hf or apple products
0345525558|2.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh is an awesome author with a special talent for describing detail and inventing interesting characters with depth. When she describes a place, you think you are there because she can capture a scene in her prose so vividly. However, the story itself is so far-fetched that it ends up feeling like a fantasy rather than real life. Though the multitude of flowers she describes gives the reader much knowledge about flowers, the fact that they're supposed to represent a whole myriad of feelings and emotions is so dated. I'm talking about at least 100 years. This lore of flowers and what they represent to a homeless person in San Francisco is way out there. I read the whole book because of the excellent writing. Ms. Diffenbaugh is definitely skilled in her craft but she doesn't give us a story that's believable. Her characters must play out as normal humans would act in specific situations and can't be overly romanticized. Sometimes in an attempt to build a character with interesting traits, or in this case, with volumes of quirkiness, you end up with a person who, in reality, could not possibly live among us because they're so dysfunctional. Mental illness should never be glorified.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A superior read, slightly non linear oral history of an epic event. Found it a compelling read.Recommended it to many friends and family.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was an excellent read!!!  Because of the subject matter it was hard to read and I had to release a few tears. Great read!!!!
B000AYELVU|2.0|I was not overjoyed with this movie. It seems to be the current Hollywood formula again, throw in enough action scenes and you don't need to bother with the remainder.<br /><br />Here is my criticism and why this movie is a failure. What it is about? Superheroes emphasis on HERO. Show me the heroes. There is close to zero character development. Storm and Nightcrawler, OK. The rest lose it. Consider:<br /><br />Professor X, the greatest mind on Earth and advocate of peace, creates a weapon of mass destruction and then his brain gets undermined by a complete dweeb.<br /><br />Cyclops, the leader of the action team, is all but written out of the film and contributes nothing.<br /><br />Jean Grey dies.<br /><br />Wolverine in his biggest battle kills a girl. Wow.<br /><br />Iceman and Rogue show no character development, in fact Rogue is really a step backwards.<br /><br />Mystique is hot but her costume is so absent they are afraid to let you have a good look at her.<br /><br />Magneto is not bad but could be better. The gap between his refined manner and his genocidal character is too great. Plus even Genghis Khan understood you don't kill everybody.<br /><br />When you get down to it the plot is insultingly predictable. They might have thought it creative to turn Professor X's own device against him but it came at the cost of destroying Patrick Stewart's character. This movie does not live up to the theme of saving the entire human race. Of which, throwing something like that in at the last minute is also very poor drama.<br /><br />My impression of the people that made this movie, the writers and director and producer: they are adequate enough and even skilled at filming comic book action scenes, but a Tennessee Williams play would be over their heads.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I have to admit that at this point I am a Mayer Superfan. Not because I'm a screaming teen in the crowd, but because I realize the brilliance of this man's talent. He is so diverse and can do so much, and all of it is musical.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons I'm such a fan and have such respect for this man is because not only does he create the music he wants to, but does it with such passion, that it is hard to not appreciate it. I'm a die hard guitar lover (I've been playing for 22 years and MOST of my music catalog has heavy guitar in it of some kind), and although Mr. Mayer hasn't released a guitar heavy record for awhile, his music still speaks to me.<br /><br />You can certainly tell he has been listening to The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan and other more \\"groovy\\" artists lately, but what's really amazing is how well he emulates them. He doesn't copy them at all, and you can clearly hear the influence, which is really quite remarkable to my ears.<br /><br />I can totally see how this record (and even the last) could have totally turned off his fan base. The other testament to him as an artist is that despite knowing this will happen (which I'm sure he does), he still does it his way. And to me, it is not only amazing music (really listen to the songs if you don't believe me), but it's refreshing to see such a talent do what he does best. Create amazing music.<br /><br />The ONLY gripe I have is that this record is on the short side. It probably would have made me happier if he had released this and the previous record as a double album.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The subject matter is difficult for those of us who are new to the Kindle world.  The details are sufficient to allow us to get our work from its word processor to the kindle format.  I shout out a true way to go.  Everyone interested in gaining an understanding of Kindle materials or publishing will benefit greatly.<br /><br />Thank you, and God bless, Richard W. Darnell, B.S., J.D.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am new to this series, and have only read the first two books.  I have not seen any of the HBO series.<br /><br />This reads like very well written alternate histories (I'm looking at you, Eric Flint):  many, many characters, a wide physical playing field, many plot threads that weave in and out of each other, and very rare endings.  Yes, characters die, ending their story arcs, but just like in the real world, the world goes on without them.  Don't read this books if you are looking for an ending, happy or otherwise.  Because you will get plenty of otherwise, seasoned with happy, and mostly lacking in endings.<br /><br />But you will also get fantastic, memorable characters, beautiful, horrible imagery, and prose that will grab you by the neck and force you to keep reading.<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to reading the next books, but deliberately spreading out the experience so that I can enjoy it for as long as possible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 had me emotionally involved more than once. However, it maintained its charm of settings, characters, costumes and writing. Excellent show.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|The characters are so interesting and the story just flows from then to now. The end was not disappointing at all. Americanah should be made into a movie.  There are so many truths about different cultures and perceptions, I think everyone can relate to the story.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I HEARD YOU GET FIFTY REPAIR POINTS IF YOU REVIEW THIS GAME. CASTAMERE THE FIRST TIME IN THE FIRST TIME I WAS IN THE WORLD. THIS GAME IS COM GUYS BUY IT
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch for the price!  Comfortable band. Keeps very good time. Have gotten many compliments on the watch. Thumbs up!  Bought my last Seiko automatic watch in 1973!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Martin Scorcese will forever be the best &#34;gangster film&#34; director.  He captures the essence of what it means to be a B.A. and makes it look enticing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This application is GREAT!!! One thing that's wrong is too many people are making other applications that can do almost the same thing as Minecraft PE. Other than that, THIS GAME IS EPIC
B00BESCJII|5.0|This film is for any lost soul. It teaches to be yourself and love it. I hope to read the book soon.
B00E193TM2|5.0|it is a very badass track with a bunch of heavy meatal head banging songs that will get you pumped
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|Simply a hilarious movie. If you're looking for some laughs, take a trip to your local theater and watch this movie. It's rated R, which should prepare you for the language and innuendo that come with this film, so I don't want to hear people complaining \\"it's not for children\\" as it is very clear it wasn't intended for kids. On the other hand, I'd much rather my young ones watch a movie with some bad language than a movie about gunning down all your enemies. Anyway, I thought this movie was excellent. The acting was superb & the characters were great. It may be another \\"typical\\" comedy film, but why change something that works? I laughed from beginning to end while watching this film and I will be purchasing it the day the Bly-ray is released. It was wonderful to leave my troubles behind for 2 hours while enjoying this film.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|the cast really make this movie special. i love each and every one actor here and they did an amazing job helping bring these characters to life in a relatable coming of age film. A+
B005XQLBU4|4.0|if you need to burn some time. or if your bored a nice little app. graphics are nice I recommend.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|This is a great release, but why is Minstrel Boy on here?  It's from 1967.  Sloppy research work, or am I missing something?
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Where else are you going to get free lectures on all sorts of topics? TED has it all and should be a valuable tool to anyone in school or just curious to learn!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was so sad to reach the last page!  As each character dealt with their own moral conflicts, I couldn't help but consider what I might have done when faced with such dilemmas.  It really demonstrated once again that life isn't so black and white!  I would have given it five stars if it didn't have foul language that i felt truly wasn't necessary.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|never a dull moment with Nelson De Mille. he spins a sTory that keeps you up at night. I enjoyed the interplay of John Corey during the tense moments.
B005LAII08|5.0|Purchased this movie for my grandchildren who absolutely loved the movie with all it's adventures.  Brave is now one of their favorite Disney movies.
1400069289|5.0|I use this book to help train a team of agents to create good work habits and stay on course.  Great book. It can be used in our everyday existence to better our lives.
B00006JMQG|2.0|The quality of the picture is atrocious and the score makes me want to claw my ears out.  It's still watchable because the film itself is so amazing, but I would highly recommend another version.<br /><br />There are better versions out there - I wish I could see stills from the movie before I bought it so that I know which version I'm purchasing.
1400069289|5.0|got book on the estamited date without any issues.<br /><br />good book with lots of interesting topics.<br /><br />i recommend this book to anyone.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS INFO ABOUT BOOKS 1-4. THERE ARE SPOILERS. As I first set in to the \\"wonderful\\" world of the sorcerer's ring, I was drawn in and compelled to read on. As I read more and more, I started to see minor problems. The biggest of these was the grammar. After seeing words like waste/waist, flour/flower and role/roll mixed up, i knew that the author needed an editor. The plot had some saving grace, but the magic Thor used to kill the beast was an amateur plot twist at best. All in all I could rate the first book at 2 or even 3 stars. I decided to get the next book to see if the author learned what the difference between waist and waste was. Apparently she had, but there were other problems. By the time I was finished, I never wanted to hear the word interminable or read the phrase \\"they embraced for a long time and the kiss Thor and Gwendolyn shared seemed to be the longest one.\\" again. The second book went on like this. Thor's magic became a device to save him whenever he was about to die. But when I reached the third book, I never wanted to hear about the series again. It went on to be the same, but decided to included elements of heavier subjects, things that a young reader shouldnt know about. The point in the series when i decided to stop reading was the end of book for where Thor's PREGNANT lady-friend is forced into sexual conduct with King Mc-Cloud. DO NOT READ THIS SERIES!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a really good game and I look forward to leveling up on this games. This game is Awsome
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I highly recommend this book to both male and female executives, supervisors, and aspiring executives. It raises awarness of cultural tendencies that can potentially hold women back, it inspires you to not settle with being the &#34;woman behind the man,&#34; and it makes you test your assumptions when interacting with others (regardless of whether you are male or female). It is sufficiently rooted in data to ground it in reality with an abundance of stories that make the messages sticky.
B00EI6E17A|3.0|its a ok song very repetive and not to many lyrics .i like lady ga ga but i was expecting more. i cant wait to hear more tracks . im shure she wont diapoint
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Love this app keep me on track. And great when I'm cooking and baking at the same time. You really must try this it's worth it.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Not a bad read but not very well researched. Too many British terms, and everyone should know it is the Secret Service not the Treasury.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I fell in love with this author when I read The Kite Runner. I had to read more from him so picked up A Thousand Splendid Suns and was thrilled to learn about this new book and as always wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />If you're a fan you'll love this book but it is a much different read from his other novels. The story flashed back and forward from character to character unlike his other works which stuck with a main character.<br /><br />I felt the beginning was griping and really grabbed me to read more and find out what happened between these two siblings. Then I was surprised about how he took the narrative in a few different directions which I'm a bit embarrassed to say at times had me a bit confused as to how each person was related to the other, it would become clear but I did find myself a few times flipping back to see if I missed a page.  Of course that may be because I was reading another book at the same time, I ended up stopping that one so I could give this the attention it deserved.<br /><br />I loved the storytelling even though I felt sometimes it became a little melodramatic and other times I didn't feel I really got to know each character as I did in his previous works. In the other books I had more of an emotional response and connection with the characters, Hosseini made me want to help women in Afghanistan and take action, sadly I didn't feel that as much here.<br /><br />Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it (even though this may not sound like it!) and would recommend and plan to read again in a few months and now that I know the books' structure is different I may even enjoy it more the second time around.<br /><br />If you haven't read anything from this author I would suggest the second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns as the one to pick if you need to decide between the three, but all are worth a read for sure.<br /><br />One thing I really do love about this author is that he gives us something new each time and has focused on different relationships in each of his books; father/son in Kite Runner, mother/daughters in Suns and now siblings in Mountains.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one.  Enjoy the book(s) and I look forward to hearing thoughts from others too.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Good book........great refresher ...... Will pass on to many ppl. Many many many tips on how to present oneself. Thanks
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I was surprised by this film. When it was in theaters, I completely wrote it off, mostly because of the comically awful Stallone version (incidentally, a good drinking game for that version is to take a shot every time someone mentions &#34;THE LAW&#34;), but when I finally gave it a shot, I was surprised by how much I liked it. It takes the source material, and makes a very solid, well paced action movie out of it. The plot is fairly simple and direct, but is well thought out for the film, and events flow fairly organically from the premise. The action is unflinching and gore-filled, and there are some beautiful slow-motion action sequences seen through the eyes of people who've used a drug that slows down perceived time, called &#34;slow-mo&#34;.<br /><br />It's not perfect, though. There are some implausible moments here and there, and the armor the Judges wear makes them far from nimble in a fairly obvious way. The middle section drags a bit, with samey action sequences filling it out, with little to break it up, but it picks up again towards the end, and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />All in all, it's well worth the time you'll spend on it, and it'll hit the spot when you're looking for a good action flick with a reasonably well thought out plot.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works awesome!  We can schedule the alarm and have it save and repeat.  Love that it has the weather also.  Makes it easy.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|The acting is tremendous along with a compelling story. We look forward to watching each show as it becomes available.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|....for a film that delivers you to that oblivious place. All I can say is don't sit down to watch it unless you are well-rested because if you aren't, you will be oblivious to the pretentious plot.
B002RXMG00|4.0|It brought back some wonderful memories of when movie offerings were punctuated with an occasional horror movie well done by Hitchcock. When gratuitous violence, gore, and bad language were not the standard fare.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Not surprisingly because of Matthew. He never ceases to amaze anyway. Surprisingly because I didn't expect the script to carry the weight it promised. Rest assured, it carries every pound with ease.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have very little ears, and have had a problem finding ear pieces that fit my ear.  This one seems to do the trick.  It has good sound and also good battery life.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Service was slow, but Crafty did work with me to get the dvd's to me.  I haven't tried watching the series yet, but for the moment I assume the discs are playable; and anticipate an enjoyable watching experience.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple calculator  (Much like the $5 calculators you might buy at a discount store.) It is not has handy as a purpose-built calculator but the calculator does work and is useful when you do not have a physical calculator at hand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I play it almost every day. It is a great game for kids and very entertaining. My family and I love this game.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|I bought the SuperTooth Buddy when we decided to keep our 2005 Honda Odyssey for a few more years.<br />The Honda is primarily the wife’s car and she want to have a hands-free phone option which led me to this product. As usual, there turned out to more hands-free devices than you can wade through, which is nice, but it makes trying to figure out just what to buy, something of a chore. After spending some time searching, this product seemed to offer what we wanted at a decent price and good overall reviews.<br /><br />The device paired with my wife’s phone after a few attempts following the directions. However, I never could get it to pair with my phone after dozens of attempts and googling the subject. In the end, I just gave up as I don’t use the vehicle that much so it was not a big issue for me. I made a custom bracket that allowed me to mount the device right above the radio so at first glance it looks factory like. It makes it easy to see and use with little distraction. It makes and receives calls with no problem and audio quality on both ends is very good. What was interesting, is that the voice command feature was automatically activated with no effort on my part. Press the green button and the device ask what you want to do. You then just speak the name of the party you wish to call and if they are in your phones address book, it makes the connection. When finished, you can press the same green button or the red button to end the call. In the case with with making a call to “Home”, it will connect every time when I do it. When the wife calls “Home”, she will have to try two or three times. I’m guessing it the difference between a male voice and a female voice.<br /><br />The other problem is the connection distance. One reviewer made mention of this, and it it’s the same for us. It seems that once the phone is synced to the device, you need to move about fifty feet (I’m guessing) away from the device before it will disconnect. In our case, when the van is in the garage, it’s only about twenty feet or so from the cellphone when it’s in the house, so it always stays paired . If you get a call, it will ring in the van, but the cellphone will not ring in the house. Plus, you can’t make a call from the phone as well. Everything is still functioning through the SuperTooth device. The only (simple) way to solve this, is to just turn the device off when home, or move the phone far enough away that it will disconnect from the device. Again, not a big deal. The other reviewer wrapped his phone with tin foil (when in the house) which worked for him.<br /><br />So, while it does have a few quirks, it does what we wanted, which is to provide hands-free operation of the wife’s phone while in the van with ease and good audio quality. It does those two things well.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|so much fun and free it can be a little hard to navagate the car and control it but its really fun
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best superhero movies ever made. As many said, RDJ was born to play Tony Stark! Excellent cast, special effects, humor, soundtrack and screenplay. Wished Terrence Howard to play Rhodey in the sequels, but alas, that didn't happen. \\"Next time, baby!\\"<br /><br />Love the cool Ironman suits and their weaponry. The scene where Tony takes Mark-2 armor for a flight test has got to be the best portrayal of a person enjoying the power of flight!<br /><br />This has made me a fan of the Armored Avenger, period.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|The first disc would not complete and by the time this gift was opened and played the time frame to return had passed by 4 days.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is similar to temple run and all games of the like. But the weapons are cool and I want to build towards having all the armour. Plus, it's friggin iron man.... man!!!
B00DJZI2N0|5.0|Amazing story, I actually got afraid while reading this book which I have never experienced. I really enjoyed the way it was written. Highly recommend this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|An easy read and very interesting how the the plays out.  Loved the ending and how it was wrapped up.
B005PK553C|2.0|Some people really like to be scared and creeped out Not me!<br />Can't see how they will survive a whole season
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book but at the same time was disappointed. I really loved the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and was expecting this book to be of the same standard which unfortunately it is not. It is definitely worth a read though.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This movie is sure to be a classic, as its actors, plot and beautiful setting all work together to paint a picture of growing older that is neither maudlin nor sugar sweet.  At first glance, I dismissed it as a cheap chick flik, but it certainly proved me wrong.  Watch and enjoy....possibly Judi Dench and Maggie Smith's best performances.
B000001Y5D|5.0|what a album for these ladys just wish they would put out a second for more good sounds this album never got anought play on the radio but one song need to push play & lison
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Wanted a bag that would accommodate a large telephoto and this bag really fits the bill.<br />Lots of arrangement options and sufficient padding.<br />Not bulky. Lightweight.<br />I would recommend it.
B00008Y3VA|5.0|uriah heep goes back to the 70 and i can still put it in and let play all day long
B009AY04A8|5.0|This app has awakened my mind in a way no other app has before! Finding the objects really opened my eye to details. It works perfectly on my kindle, and the graphics are amazing. I also love how you can be in the middle of dialogue and turn off my kindle, go on with the rest of my life, and come back exactly where I left off. It's great, and totally worth the money!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I don't read a lot of Stephen King. Okay, I've never read any Stephen King...but this one I loved. It's not one of his &#34;horror&#34; novels, although, there are some pretty graphic/violent scenes. The premise is time travel and the effects of it on the world. Also, there's the assassination of JFK. Yeah, there's a lot going on. I found the main character likable and enjoyed rooting for him. His travels and adventures are interesting to read about and this made a fun book club choice as it provided some interesting discussion.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Caught the first have of this season and had to order the rest to see it through to the end of the season.  Gripping story and pleanty of action.  One of the scenes within the first couple of episodes that really set this apart for me was when the main character, Rick Grimes, shows a moment of compassion for one of the zombies and actually apologies to it.  He doesn't apologies for blowing it's head off, but says he is sorry that this happened to her.  Gave the show a different take on the zombie genre.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I bought this for the one song &#34;Stay&#34; but, I found there were several other songs on it I liked. I do not like rap.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Onr of the best albums I have heard all the way through for a long time.  Top to bottom the songs are amazing.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is hysterical.  It's the perfect combo of scary/creepy, dry British humor, and zombie apocalypse.  who doesn't love that these days?
B004UID2LC|2.0|Haven't transitioned from using traditional YouTube, which is excessable everywhere, to this.  Probably need to try it some more, but it is so easy to just find it on regular You Tube.
B002WY65VU|5.0|In perfect order when shipped, good price -- funny money -- but not for young kids, of course. :)  Your Zombie-crazed fans will love it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it, can't get enough of it!  Seen every episode and am totaly hooked.  Just watch the first 6, it is the first season and a complete story arc.  It's enthralling and takes you on a journey with these people that keeps with you.
1586638491|5.0|Inexpensive and accessible version for students.  I purchased this copy for a student and she has found it quite helpful!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Too confusing, didn't engage me right away.  So much going on I really could not get into it too much.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not too dramatic, but keeps you involved. I was very surprised by this show, did not realize I would like it this much.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It gets kinda slow for a while. They couldve done sooo much more with the idea of this movie.<br />Its Ok as a redbox type rental but i wouldnt be happy if i had paid $12 to watch.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Now I can't wait to see &#34;Despicable me 2&#34;!<br />Always a little annoying to login, and download the code... Loved the movie, though!
B005544V6A|4.0|i like the concept and chareter development, hard for a tv show to actuly have consistant good eposides, but this one makes it
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|In the actions section, there is.no download option. I have not tried to load this to another device,  so it should be available to download. I can't play the game, if I can't put it on my device.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is sooo awsome! I love running the little minions they are soo very cute and hilarious!I totally recommend this app
B00640UICA|4.0|I think this is a very challenging game to try to get all the little guys hands together in the right way
B004ADH1RI|5.0|It was a great movie. It is still a great movie. The quality via internet on a mobile device was surprisingly good.
B007ZB06OW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with how easy this kit was to assemble. Most of the model is press fit with only some of the very small parts requiring glue. Tweezers and a very sharp knife are a must. In addition, the main parts are molded in color to painting the ship itself isn't really required if it's not something you're good at. The fighters will have to be painted though.<br /><br />The one thing that really impressed me was that unlike other press fit kits (or any kits for that matter) that I've made in the past, the major seams between hull parts are very tight and the structure as a whole is much less delicate than it would appear.<br /><br />Not disclosed in the description is the fact that the kit included a bonus Gamilon carrier model kit. I don't know if this is standard for this kit or just a limited edition bonus that happened to be in the one I received, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Definitely a five star kit and worth it for anyone who loves Space Battleship Yamato/Star Blazers!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Turned out to be more exciting than expected. Keeps you guessing through out the movie. Would recomened it to others
B009GXHOW4|2.0|If you never heard of UTK, search it up, but UTK is an awesome app where you can use mods, texture packs, skins, and more!! I have a kindle fire that has UTK but it's sad that my kindle fire hd doesn't have it. 2 STARS!!!!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This is just another great disc from Buddy Guy! Love it! its hard to believe he is 77 years old pretty wailin guitar!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great game. Wish you could personalize your character but still a really good game. Would be cool if they gave you a way to earn the gems though.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|The first hand views and the human detail make this an interesting read.  Gone are any political reflections or cultural lessons.  This is strictly how the human mind coped (or did not cope) with an insane, immoral environment.  Frankl's writing is dry, but is very detailed.  I now understand the mindset of those unfortunate people who landed in a German concentration camp.  Every hour is concerned with survival and learning what seems to work within this insane structure.  From a psychological standpoint, this is a formidable undertaking, but the author handles it with focus and accuracy.  I would recommend it to anybody.
B004IPPINW|5.0|This book is a great example for those who where around for 911 and for those who are too young to remember, but are interested in knowing what exactly happened in NYC during that time period, which also affected the rest of the world.  The point of view of this text in exquisite and leads the reader to follow a young man's struggles in comprehending and deal with a changing world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a very fun game. It has amazing graphics. And it is fun for kids. I would say between the ages 4 to 15 to have fun with this game. Not to hard, not to easy, it's just right.  :)
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|The book was okay but I thought the ending was not well done at all. I don't think I would recommend this book.
1442419814|2.0|I was initially excited about this after reading the back cover. Unfortunately, the plot was very predictable and many details were irrelevant (took away from the heart of the action). A couple of my middle school students felt the same way. It may also be because the Hunger Games is a tough suit to follow. I was able to do a lot of skimming without feeling I missed anything.
B005544TRQ|5.0|'Suits' seems to be the legal version of 'House'. Great characters with episodic stories that feed another longer story running continually throughout the series and occasionally coming to the foreground in impactful ways. Both funny and dramatic, Suits will pull you in more and more with each passing episode; prepare to get hooked.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|It's perfect music to listen to while getting your work done.  I have listened to it everyday since I got it.
B005R32L66|5.0|I could never talk to my son in Europe without this app!  Or SEE him!  Once in awhile we lose connection, but one of us simply calls back.  No big deal.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Good movie,although  not as great as the 1st one though The cast  were great, good choice<br />Three starts only for this
B0042XA2U4|4.0|I am usually not inclined to read romance/humor/angst.  However, when reading the reviews for this story, I decided to make an exception.  And I am so glad that I did!  PS, I Love You was wonderfully written.  I cried and I laughed, often times simultaneously.  I saved the book in my library because I definitely intend on reading it again in the future.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|It was nice to see that the old movies are still being remembered in the new Abrams universe. Good Job!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Started out fast and was a good read.  Sure, some situations were a bit unbelievable but I thought it generally added to the story line.  I enjoyed the scientific thought process taken for each situation and the humor was appropriate, at least for me.  Made a good summertime beach/pool book.  Light and fun.
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|This is one of the best albums i have ever hear. Glad Fall Out Boy are back with a great album.
145210655X|5.0|My husband was about to celebrate his first Father's Day when this book mysteriously arrived in the mail.  It seems our one month old son was able to navigate to amazon.com, select this item, and input my credit card information to order it - all through the use of the force.  He even included a witty gift note.  We were so proud of our budding young jedi, until we discovered he had also ordered a number of expensive movie props and random electronic parts to build his own working lightsaber.  We're hoping he chooses to use his powers for good, but since he also purchased some Vader Dark Roast coffee and an army of toy stormtroopers, we're prepared to love him anyway.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game, and it would be even better if gameloft would give it the faction update that recently came out on the iPhone.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Really great app for Kindle Fire, I love it! This app is right on the mark very accurate I also like  the layout design.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I enjoyed the movie as it was an interesting story along with action.  I like the actors and I am glad the same ones are still doing the story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a great action flick. Very clean, great acting, great special effects, great story. Robert Downey Jr. shines, as usual.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love all the addictive shows, Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Walking Dead, Weeds, etc..<br /><br />There is none as good as this, make sure you have some free time when you begin this fantastic voyage!!!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I really like this app. It is just like as if you are using Facebook on your computer.it sometimes won't let me on, but I don't know if that is because of my kindle or the app. I still like the set up best.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I enjoy it. I don't' have a big long explanation of what I like about this product from Amazon store
B00A81NFAS|5.0|My absolute favorite movie in the last two years! And the music, by Danny Elfman--I believe--really gets me. I could just listen to it for hours. I don't know why I've seen a lot of haters of this movie. Some criticism for the way they &#34;handled&#34; the subject matter. Others were &#34;bored&#34;. How? I just love this movie!! So glad I have it in Digital Copy, as well, and can play it through my iTunes when away from home and want something that makes me feel good.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book is such a page turner. It really looks at every side of life in prison and current drug laws. I love the author/main character she is someone you wish was your best friend. Awesome book!
B00EFNXPFK|3.0|Kinda boring.  And I don't get the album artwork.  I understand what he was going for, but he will never be the homegrown emotionally confident cowboy with strong ideals we want him to be.  His fans want a bluesy Jack Johnson.  But instead get a person Taylor Swift wrote a song about.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Very strange series can't wait to start series 2. I wish it was on prime. Hopefully soon it will be.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really enjoyed Pirate Adventures: the puzzles were just challenging enough and had enough variation that I didn't get bored. Once I discovered that I could skip the dialog the game got a lot better. Frankly I couldn't guess who wrote the script for this game, but the dialog between characters reads as if it was written by computer-based artificial intelligence program. It literally made no sense in parts.<br />Like all hidden objects game this one is basically a way to pass the time as it doesn't pose any serious intellectual challenges, doesn't require much eye-hand coordination, and has no strategy component. That having been said, the graphics are well executed, the game is reasonably challenging, and there are enough puzzles that the game takes a few hours of play to complete.
B00C0EA1TO|4.0|The Dark Knight seemed to have faltered a little bit somewhere, though I'd be very hard-pressed to say where exactly. I quite liked Bane as the Big Heavy in the film, the amoral mercenary taking Gotham by storm for the purpose of the city's destruction...and with a point to prove along the way. A point similar to the Joker's in the previous installment.<br /><br />It wasn't hard to see the analogies Nolan was drawing with his film, but somehow the points about them got muddled. Yes, the Wall Street crowd was glaringly obvious but they became victims so quickly and painfully that I found myself wondering where the director's sympathies lay. The response of the citizens of Gotham to the sudden vulnerability of the rich was brutal and downright cruel, making me wonder who we were supposed to be having sympathy for.  The Dent Act parallels the Patriot Act, hailed as a great protector of the people against organized crime, only to have been built on a lie whose revelation marked the beginning the descent into chaos.<br /><br />I was also rather bothered by the near-elevation of Batman to Christ-status by Gordon in his speech just after that dreadful revelation. Maybe they should have had Batman on a crucifix for the statue of him at the end. Hell, Batman's entire arc in this tale seemed to be a well-worn Sacrificial Savior arc...and I'm always irritated by those.
0446567329|5.0|That's really all there is to say. The book is much much better than the movie. Worth reading for sure.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla should be read!! This is a well-written, common-sense, structured approach to the underlying logic with which we might all try to practice, when trying (or not, as the case may be) to achieve something, or other! The life history of Nikola Tesla is icing on the cake, and a great example of what hard work can achieve!
B007IK44CK|3.0|It's ok the plot is actually a bit weak, the action shots are ok if that's what you are interested in
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I bought this as a spare. Wish these came with the outlet adapter and it doesn't make sense why they are sold seperately.
0316223239|5.0|I loved this book, and thoroughly enjoyed reading from that narrative prospective of Jack.<br /><br />His naivety of the situation at hand was just as jarring and poignant as a traditional adult perspective, but for other startling reasons.<br /><br />Fantastic, all around wonderful book.
B0020BUWX2|1.0|I pay for that much for this story. It was not worth it. No depth just boring. I skimmed through it because it was that detestable.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a good game but can be a little frustrating at times.  It isn't nearly as much fun as Bubble Bat shooter.  I would like to see a change to this game that would allow you to skip a level any time and not limit the number of times you can skip over a level that is just too hard to complete.  Younger people might like this game.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This just wasn't up to par with many of the other Kindle games that are out there. It was boring and got old after a few minutes.
B00138CYD4|1.0|some of the song's solos have been cut or shortened. The worst is black magic woman which is turned from an amazing instrumental into basically a pop song. I wouldn't have bough this if I had known that.
B004HYDM0A|5.0|Who wouldn't fall in love with Nev and feel sorry for the poor guy. The movie was extremely interesting and entertaining. After all, it got me hooked on the MTV television show.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is fun but very brief. Runs too fast to be enjoyable for long. Frequently does nothing when finger swipes to change direction.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I recently purchased Sony's MDR7506 headphones, specifically because I was looking for headphones with good, accurate response.  The large diaphragm provides the excellent bass response for which I had hoped.  Unlike some other headphones that I've owned, these are lightweight (but seem plenty sturdy) and very comfortable to wear.  In fact, the over-ear design, padding, and overall comfort may even be more impressive than the sound.  And, even though these are by no means &#34;noise-cancelling&#34; headphones, the over-ear design does a decent job of blocking out low levels of noise.  I couldn't be happier about this purchase!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Great movie I watch it all the time now! The best animated movie I've seen plus its Daft Punk's music!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|i love this show all the actors seem to get along well and it shows in the story lines. i would suggest everyone to watch it. it leaves you felling good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is so fun because you get updates and then you get to explore new citys like new york paris my favorite one  was Europe because of the new person which i got and i like to do the goals to access the next doulble point thing bad reviews are not true and whoever wrote them are just haters and are emo kids
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|The app was to tiny and when I open the app it just referred me to web sites.  Waste of my money!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book was a waste of time.  Basically it tried to say you can't believe in God unless you have faith.....DUUUUUUHHHHHH
0425267695|1.0|I am 3/4 way through this book and I have reached the conclusion that his is better suited for a much younger audience.  This is a typical coming of age story of a child growing up in Hogwarts (oops, I meant 'the Order') with his fellow classmates.  He has a pet dog named Scratch and a horse named Spit.  Sword-wielding 12-year olds that take on full grown soldiers is NOT Fantasy, it is fodder for middle-schoolers.<br /><br />I have since moved on to reading Scott Lynch's \\"Lies of Locke Lamora\\". It does a much better job of telling a coming-of-age story without insulting the readers intelligence by placing children in sword fights and war.  Lynch's characters are adults in the story, but half the book features interludes that reflect back to their upbringing which fills in the backstory.  A much better execution.<br /><br />Anyway, fans of Harry Potter... Blood Song is for you!  Given the popularity of Harry and his classmates, I can now understand how this book was rated so well.  Personally though, I never cared for it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even if you aren't drawn to science fiction, this is a story that will compel you to read it even when you think you don't have time to read.  It will wrap your thoughts into a warm and fuzzy ball of wool; one that can only be untangled by reading through to the end of the story and ultimately towards the end of this intriguing series.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|This movie was purchased as a Christmas present for one of my granddaughters. I can`t review the movie because I never saw the movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This a great app with super features!  I especially like the weather feature.  Love that I can dim the screen as well!
B00005JSGK|5.0|This was purchased for a friend who could not find a copy anywhere, so I ordered it for him and he loves it, watches it over and over.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Basic missile defense game, but pretty darn addictive. Fast paced, good simple graphics, easy to learn. Worth $1 for sure.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Funny, funny, funny.  Great for infants to adults.  Do wish that Amazon would rebuffer instead of stopping the program. word
B00ECUARO8|5.0|&#34;a sleeper that grabs you as it goes about life and the lessons learned. suitable for older tweens.<br />great performances by the entire cast. Should be an oscar nominee with the older boy getting a best<br />actor award. A summer surprise&#34;
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Clary Fray is one of my favorite characters in this book. Yes, she's a little helpless (she's human compared to all of these paranormal beings--of course she's going to be a little helpless). Yes, she doubts the existence of Shadowhunters and demons and all that jazz (I probably would too if I was raised like a normal human being, a.k.a. a mundie). But she doesn't over-react. All of her reactions were realistic, and that's a big thing for me.<br /><br />Jace, on the other hand, is pretty much the opposite of Clary. He's experienced, he was raised to fight demons, and he is not helpless. I actually liked Jace (what can I say? I have a thing for fictional playboys) and he made me laugh several times while reading this book. But he and the rest of the Shadowhunters need Clary. For Clary is a little bit more special than she thinks she is.<br /><br />And don't forget about the other characters. Izzy, Alec, Luke, and the rest of them help Clary along the way and also provide vital clues for the mystery of the cup to be solved. The person I felt really bad about though is Simon. Poor Simon is being pretty much used and then forgotten. It's kind of sad.<br /><br />The plotline is pretty darn original, as is the world Cassandra created. The cup, Clary's mother, and a few other mysteries keep you turning the pages. Be warned though, they aren't all resolved in this book (it is a series, after all) and there are some twists (one thing in particular, thanks Cassandra) that you won't see coming.<br /><br />I recommend this book for people who like all things paranormal, a teeny bit of romance, and lots and lots of action.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game drives me crazy. It will pull you in and then slap you around a bit. The higher the level the more frustrating it gets. Still, you will go back for more. It is conceivable that one could buy and play only this game for years, and be perfectly happy (and frustrated)!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Mobo Player allows you to import just about *any* video file and watch it.  I love it for that simplicity alone.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I use Twitter for nothing else other than to keep up on local news, science, and mathematics.  I don't use it like these celebrities who &#34;tweet&#34; about their lives.  For news and global events, this app is great.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The Book Thief may have been written for younger readers, but the writing was excellent. I would recommend this book to any of my reading friends.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Also, sometimes I get notifications after I have already replied to the online site.  It gets annoying but if you really need this on the go, it will work at times.  They need to develop a better app.

B008JFUO4U|2.0|COOL trailer and 2 of my favorite actors, sci fi in the future: my favorite type of movie. But nah, this movie just didn't do it for me.
B006WVVA28|5.0|I purchased this for a combined gaming/simulation build. I've never had any trouble with it and it easily handles anything I throw at it. As part of my job, I run parallelized simulations so it runs at full load for extended periods and is perfectly fine. I've seen some people complaining that it doesn't come with a heat sink, but if you are buying a processor like this and plan on fully utilizing it, you don't want a stock cooler anyway. I use [[ASIN:B005O65JXI Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (RR-212E-20PK-R2)]].
B002O2THRO|4.0|So I like most people who were in school years ago had to read this book in High school.  I loved the book back then and had never tried to watch the movie.  Now that the new version is out I had to see the original first.  It is a great story of how far someone will go for love.  And also how the ultra-rich are different from the rest of us.  Mia Farrow is a bit annoying but Redford was in his prime in this movie.  It was a great film.  I definitely suggest watching before watching the new version.  See what real films were like...more story and less flashing lights to distract the viewer.

B004SKHJF2|3.0|I downloaded this version of Shazam because both the older Shazam and Soundhound have difficulties in recognizing music without words.  Although this is a good program, it still does not seem to handle instrumentals well.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|Oh how I love the characters of Eva and Gideon!! I hated for their story to end after book 3, especially when the last installment felt rushed/ unfinished & didn't really have a good concrete spot to end the book on. If it would have been better executed or more thought out, then in would have definitely upped the review to 5 stars.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Smart, entertaining.  Loved it. Sixteen more words required to describe this excellent book.  Seven more words and I can submit this review and get Amazon to stop bugging me.  THE BOOK IS GREAT!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Oh how I love the characters of Eva and Gideon!!

B009RX8AQW|5.0|Season Two of Once Upon A Time, ABC's drama about classic fairy tale characters living in modern times is now available on Blu-ray. This 5 disc set includes all 22 episodes in glorious hi-definition. This is why TV on DVD/Blu-ray has been invented. I'm the first to rail against ABC Tv's flakey scheduling for breaking a lot of shows. Serialized TV programs like Once Upon A Time, Revenge, Scandal are meant for binge watching. I admittedly have a very short attention span and I lose interest when I only get 1 or 2 episodes every one or two months.  So with Once Upon a Time I bailed on Season Two after Episode 7 last year.<br /><br />When you watch this show on Blu-ray as a complete overarching story, the writing truly is brilliant and addicting.  Now that the writers didn't have to spend a lot of time establishing who these characters are and how their modern incarnations related to the fairytales that we know and love, they were able to radically expand their universe this season.  All of the various plot threads, different settings and flashbacks really come together perfectly. The production design in this show is better than most big budget films. This show must cost an absolute fortune to produce.<br /><br />Now that Storybrooke is visible to the entire world and magic exists in the real world, the producers actually ended up completely expanding the mythology and introduced the concept of other universes.  We spent a lot of time in Fairytale land where we were introduced to the both Hook (Colin O'Donoghue ) and Mulan (Jamie Chung).  We met Wendy and the Darlings and had a brief visit to a dark, twisted Neverland that is run by an evil Peter Pan, all before coming back to the real world and visiting that den of sin known as New York.<br /><br />This show has wonderfully complex and fully fleshed out characters. No one is all evil or all good on this show.Snow (Ginnifer Goodwin), her feisty daughter Emma (Jennifer Morrison), the evil Stepmother Regina (Lana Parrilla ), and Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle ) all hold their own and have moments where you think you know what they are going to do, but frequently surprise you. I'm amazed that young Henry (Jared Gilmore) is still around. I fully expected them to come up with some excuse to turn him into an adult Henry. Kid actors on fantasy shows usually don't last beyond a season.<br /><br />No princess need to be saved here, they need to be feared!  These \\"Princesses\\" don't take crap from anyone. There is a reason television is so good and much better than movies these days. It seems like all the best actors are on TV shows like this, Scandal, Grimm, Breaking Bad, etc. It would take up 2 paragraphs for me to name everyone in this large cast but everyone, except, maybe, Charming (Josh Dallas ) but from top to bottom, good stuff.<br /><br />The video and audio transfer is flawless. I love the bright blue color palette used on this show. Everything looks gleaming, fresh and new.  While the material is sometimes dark, the shine and gloss goes a long way towards lightening the tone. There weren't any artifacts in the picture and while my HDTV doesn't have the blackest blacks in the world, the contrast looked great.  The 5.1 sound mix is nice, it's TV so most of the audio had a nice, well balanced Center channel mix and rarely made much use of the rear channels.<br /><br />  English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio<br />  English 2.0 Dolby Digital<br />  Subtitles are in English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French,<br /><br />It comes in a standard Blu-ray case with a nice slip cover featuring some nice artwork - that would be awesome as a framed picture. The menu is simple and easy to navigate.<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />Season Play - Its been awhile since I watched a nice TV on Blu-ray set and I love Season Play. As someone who swaps discs all the time, it is nice to be able to stop a show and know that when I put the disc back in, it'll automatically start from where I left off or let me know which disc and episode I last watched.  It also allows you to create multiple profiles.  I wish all Blu-rays and DVDs had this functionality..Not just TV Blu-rays but regular movies. Nothing annoys me more than when I accidently hit the stop button on my remote and have to go through the entire startup process - previews, scene selection or forced to fast forward to find my place.<br /><br />Episode specific commentary tracks:<br /><br />  Disc 1 - Audio Commentary on Broken with Actors Ginner Goodwin and Josh Dallas<br /><br />  Disc 2 - Audio Commentary on Queen of Hearts with Co-Creators/Exec Producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and Actor Lana Parrilla<br /><br />  Disc 3 - Audio Commentary on Manhatten with Co-Creators/Exec Producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and Actor Robert Carlyle<br /><br />  Disc 4 - Commentary on The Miller's Daughter with Writer Jane Espenson, Commentary on Welcome to Storybrooke with Writers Ian Goldberg and Andrew Chambers<br /><br />  Disc 5 - Commentary on And Straight on Til Morning with Commentary by Co-Executive Producer David H. Goodman and Actor Colin O'Donoghue<br /><br />Other features:<br /><br />  Good Morning Storybrooke (12 min, HD) - A very cute 12-minute feature done in the style of a cheesy morning talk show with Hart Archer & Goldie Locksley.<br /><br />  A Fractured Family Tree, Narrated by Sarah Hyland of ABC's Modern Family (7 Min, HD) - A look at Family tree of the Charmings and man what a convoluted tree it is. This featurette serves as a great introduction to all of the intricacies of the various relationships in the series.<br /><br />  Sincerely, Hook (5 Min, HD) - All about Hook, need I say more!?<br /><br />  Girl Power (13 Min, HD) - I love all the women in Once Upon A Time and this is a great showcase as to why these women kick butt!<br /><br />  Fairest Bloopers of them All (3 Min, HD)<br /><br />  Deleted Scenes (10 Mins) - There are 8 deleted scenes that total about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I love this Blu-ray set, I don't understand why Networks don't put more shows out on Blu-ray. The extras are well thought out and not overwhelming. This series really is meant to be watched in Bing form. Anyone who likes fantasy and drama even a little bit need to give this show a try. This would be an A+ if they included a Digital Copy version.<br /><br />Grades<br /><br />  TV Show - A<br /><br />  Video - A<br /><br />  Audio - A<br /><br />  Extras - A<br /><br />Final Overall Grade - A
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Oh how I love the characters of Eva and Gideon!! I hated for their story to end after book 3. This series is so engrossing from the get go, and the love scenes are steamy. This is one of those I couldn't put down until I finished the whole thing-It was that good!!

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Lots to like in this movie. Overall it missed its potential. The use of modern rap music was a mistake in my view. It just didn't fit. There was so much good music of the time that they could have worked with.
B001EBV0MG|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was younger.<br />This is how movies today should be. A real story with depth like someone put real thought into it. Wasn't contrived over night to fill a summer weekend slot.<br />Great movie!

B00378VGGO|5.0|This film is one of my favourites.<br />I have been a fan of Wes Anderson since I was young, and saw Rushmore for the first time.<br />He's an impeccable filmmaker and I was actually just telling a friend today that this film redeemed him from the disaster that was Darjeeling Limited.<br /><br />The aesthetic, the humour, the heartfelt moments, the action, it's all perfect.<br />The acting is great, the animation is spotless, and it's incredibly well adapted for the screen.<br /><br />Normally I'm skeptical about adaptations for books, but I didn't hesitate with this one at all.<br />Definitely watch this film, you will not be disappointed.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The first time I watched it, I had to replay it. I love this movie. One of my top favs.<br /><br />You'll really appreciate all of the name droppers if you're a fan of 1920s art, music, literature, Paris, etc.<br /><br />And who doesn't love that cute, Owen Wilson grin? ;)

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|To be fair, it's not really cyberpunk as seen in the '80s. But it's damn close. Ready Player One is a book that is very much a celebration of the '80s, and while some of the references were lost on me(Being primarily a '90s kid, it's hard to give a damn about Joust or Tempest when Mario World and Battletoads and the like are what I wasted my childhood away with), the setting is fantastically crafted, the characters are extremely well developed, and the plot is tight as all getout. You really grow to like Wade, and feel for his unrequited crush. And while he is terrible at dealing with girls, you gotta remember that the dude grew up using the internet as his primary means of communication. It kinda makes sense.<br /><br />There's not much to say that doesn't spoil the plot, except that the book is really, really good. My one complaint is that the villains are kinda... moustache-twirlingly, Snidely Whiplash levels of evil. That's not a bad thing in this case, as the stakes are high enough that you can understand why they are that way. I dropped ten bucks on this book, something I never, ever, ever do unless I am already in love with the author.<br /><br />I will drop ten or twenty bucks on Ernest Cline's next unflinchingly. What a good ride RP1 was.
B003A166OK|4.0|He gets the best of the the baddies after a few cuts and beatings. Beautiful country where it was filmed.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very funny and intense at the same time. The show is written in a brilliant fashion and the acting is incredible.
0756405890|2.0|I appear to be a lone wolf in this opinion so take my review with a grain of salt. I found this book to be one of the most long-winded, boring things I have ever read, except for maybe Crossroads of Twilight from the Wheel of Time series. The story revolves around a legendary hero telling the story from his point of view, essentially busting his own myths. Interesting concept, but boring execution. In fact, the concept actually says it's going to be boring. It's basically, I'm not as awesome as everyone thinks, let me tell you the real story, which is much less exciting.<br />  I will write the entire plot to this book in four sentences: Kvothe grows up with nomad actors. His family is killed. He spends three years as a poor kid in a city. He then goes to the University where he pisses some people off and makes some people love him. Now to be fair, the entire Star Wars trilogy could be summed up like this: Luke's parents are killed. He joins the rebellion, becomes a Jedi, and saves the galaxy. But there are several plot points that detail those sentences like, Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father, he saves Han Solo from Jaba the Hutt, etc. With this book, there really are no details to be added, just those four sentences with 700 pages of padding. It's the same subplot repeated over and over again: Kvothe is sitting good. Then something happens and he loses everything. Then he does something to make some money. Then he loses everything. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br />  The whole thing reads like it's trying to be a darker and edgier Harry Potter, but Harry Potter had interesting magic and a plot outside of what they do in school. This book has boring \\"magic\\" that is rarely used, and the whole thing centers on his interactions with people at or around school.
B007N85POS|3.0|My grandchildren loves to play this game.  He always tells me how he is doing and what level he got to.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My 6 yr old son loves it, uses it to play on as advertised and also to carry all his Lego stuff that he is playing with each time.  Definitely keeps about a million Lego pieces in our play area and let's him take what he wants wherever he wants
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A very fun game. I recommend this game if you like games like Temple Run, etc. Minion Rush is a FUN game
B0091REZMW|5.0|Had to do a factory reset on my Kindle and lost all of my progress, even logging in to Game Insight and connecting to Facebook it can't be retrieved.. Anyone else have this happen or know how to fix it? So mad, I was already level 35!!!<br /><br />Other than this, game is awesome. No complaints.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app isn't just for the fire HD. it seems fine on the original Kindle Fire. Not sure why all of those negative reviews say otherwise.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Thank you Austin Kleon for this book. It's been almost 20 years, and this was the book I needed to get to work again. Life changing.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|My daughter, who is not a big eader, loved this book. If your child likes fantasy and fairy tales, this is a great choice.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I rewatched the old series recently.  It was great to see the house carry on and Miss Rose become a part of<br /> it's new story.
0143119680|2.0|This book is WAY too long at 586 pages.  I skipped over 100 pages in the middle to lessen my reading time, and I didn't miss a beat.  What a corny book! Why are vampires always so rich?  If I lived a long time, I would have less money to spend.  Maybe they're thieves as well and amass fortunes that way? Besides, the vampire in this book knew every famous author and scientist along the way.  Yawn!<br />This book was suggested by a acquaintance of mine who is a medium, so I thought it would be deeper than it was.  It turned out to be nothing but a Harlequin-type romance book.  I never read the Twilight books nor did I see the movies, but from the reviews I read of them which gave synopses, I imagine this is what they were like.  Nothing new here.  The scenes in the aunt's house had some elements which reminded me of Harry Potter (which books I DID read).  The story doesn't end at the end of the book and just leaves things open for the sequel which may be more interesting since it involves time travel. (I know it's not as long).
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is very near and dear to my heart, probably tying with Lirael as my favorite in the Abhorsen trilogy. The contrast between territories in the book (the land of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom, separated by the Wall) is stark and troubling, and I love the usage of creatures/familiars/however you'd like to put it in the books.<br /><br />As for Sabriel(no spoilers, I promise!), you are introduced to maybe one of my all-time-favorite literary characters, Mogget, as well as a plethora of other dark, mysterious, and powerful creatures and beings. While this book is absolutely swimming in death, I would never call it a zombie novel, a horror, or anything like that. I think of it as a very unique fantasy journey that illustrates death in a way that I'd never considered or imagined before. The dead do walk, and it is horrifying at times, but you will find a great deal of well-placed comedy, and the characters, from the most vital and vigilant to the rank and rotten, all have richly developed demeanors/personalities. I am easily immersed in this story every time- I love traveling with titular protagonist Sabriel through the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />The Abhorsen trilogy is one of my favorite series in the entire world, and I'm still combing to find books of a similar nature. There is truly nothing like these books, with Sabriel being a strong and unforgettable start. Also, irrelevant sidebar: my friend's dog chewed up my first-edition copy of Lirael last summer (how ironic that her dog chewed up the book with The Dog), and I was entirely distraught and will have to repurchase. I have had it since I was 12 (I'm 22 now) and it was the most traumatizing literary event to ever physically happen to me. Ok I'm done now.
B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent show!! Every episode makes you want to watch the next. The story is well scripted. The concept of Aliens taking over the planet, keeps me on the edge of seat.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Just a wonderful story.  Plenty of twists and turns, but what a morally sound and solid book! I found it to be very thought provoking even though I did not completely agree with everything.  Now I want to see the movie.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Love the cd, loved hearing Vince Gill and Paul Franklin doing a great job of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens hits.
B0014JKJHK|1.0|These shoes were a complete disappointment.  My 1st pair of Crocs were the exact brand and they were so comfortable it was like walking on clouds.  They were durable and held up at work for years.  This pair are extremely uncomfortable and I already had to superglue the bottoms back together.  Nothing against Amazon, because I went out to stores to try on different Crocs to see if I could find any that were more comfortable and they felt the same.  I just think that Crocs is producing lower quality shoes since they have gotten so popular.  My next pair of work shoes will be a different brand.<br />I would have complained sooner, but when I looked for a place to write a  review,  shortly after I bought the shoes, I couldn't find a place to write one.  I just got an email to review a different purchase I recently made.  I thought maybe Amazon knew I bought a crappy item and didn't want to hear my review.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you've watched any of these episodes, you know the storyline.  You're on the edge of your chair wondering who the axe will fall on next, quite literally.  Love love this series.
B007TK77QE|1.0|It has been couple of weeks since I bought this book under a dollar fromkindle. It has been a journey of pain completing this book. The book lacks excitement and has multiple characters going in circles around the death of a councillor. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The storyline and acting in this show is superb!  It sucks you in and you start thinking along the lines of the main character.  Can't wait for Season 2 to come online.  Just fantastic.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Let me first preface this by saying I am NOT a prude and can swear with the best of 'em when I need to. That being said, WOW!!! my only problem with this whole production is the EXCESSIVE use of the 2 'C' words and of course the ever popular 'F' word. My God guys!  I'm sure the ancient Romans could  swear up a storm, but soooooo much?  It takes away from the beauty of the rest of the dialogue, which has a definte Shakesperean flavor to it. Quite frankly it gets tiresome after a while and makes the characters sound like low class trash instead upper class Romans.<br />That being said, I've recorded  the other 3 productions on the DVR and bought the 'Gods....&#34; DVR planning to also buy the others, so you know I'm a complete fan.<br />The beautiful actors and actresses,(Andy,Manu, and Liam hmmmmm), the gorgeous costumes, the incredible fight scenes (WOW),and oh yeah, all the naked guys (lol) have made for many hours of complete escape. But please don't flood us with Cs and<br />F's quite so much when something else might be used to get the point across..  Another thought occured to me.......as depraved and blood thirsty as the Romans were, I find it quite ironic (as a Catholic) that the Church put the Vatican in Rome!!!<br />Congrats to your whole crew!  Katie D
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Out of all the Bingo Apps...Bingo Blitz is the best :-) I love the sound effects and the pace of the game. Thoroughly enjoyable. I would recommend this app to people even if they don't like B.I.N.G.o
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|I  like the majority of the songs,  and she has a  really good voice!  I like it  better than her last album.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|as a longtime fan of the series, I was not disappointed with the adaptation.  For those who have not read the books, you should.  But it is not necessary to enjoy the production.  Wonderful script, casting and sets.  I really, really, really recommend it.  My son who doesnt like fantasy and rarely likes TV series loved it too.  Something for everyone (except perhaps for the squeamish or those who do not want a complex plot).
B004HD61KE|5.0|The book had a fast read and really kept going with minimal slowdown.  Rollins has a good hand in keeping things going and mixing together history and make believe.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I wouldn't rent this again...wished I would've waited to see it for free on cable. The beginning of the movie was interesting and started off good but then the story just got weird and immature. Kissing boys left, right and center and the &#34;inner voice&#34; dialogue was<br />cheesy.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I love &#34;Lost&#34; for one big reason...you just never know what  bizarre twists the storyline is going to take...but you know it's going to take them.  What an adventure!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a semi challenging game for adults and kids alike. Just trying to aim in the right spot is the challenge here.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|i did not like this movie. the acting was stiff and the special effects were not special. i do not recommend it.
B0090SI4HO|4.0|ALL ACTION AND I LIKED IT ALOT. IT MAKES YOU WATCH IT INTENSIVELY AND JUST WHAT I LOVE ABOUT ARNOLD MOVIES.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Love this one!  Once I figured out how to use it on my new 1st gen Fire.  I'm old and slow, but I get there, and this is great.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|THIS MOVIE MADE ME GO WAY BACK IN TIME AND WHAT A TIME IT WAS.  IT KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES IN WONDERING WHAT'S NEXT...I GIVE IT A TWOO THUMB UP..
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|good family movie, some humor for adults yet appropriate for children. the minions are hilarious, wish they showed more of them.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|MY KIND OF GUY MOVIE. TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE AND LET IT RIP.  I COULD NOT KEEP MY EYES OFF THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU WILL MISS THE ACTION.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|Sometimes I think the Doris Day movies are a bit goofy, but that is also their charm!  Her movies convey a very fun story and also maintain good morals.  Unlike movies of today.
B0080CKGZE|2.0|If the film's central premise is that all of these women find Robert Pattinson's character irresistible, then of course the film fails. The film never allows us to get a glimpse into why they do. This is due in part to Pattinson turning in an ambivalent and frustrating performance. I get that the character isn't supposed to settle into anything reminiscent of consistency, but the actor's performance should.<br /><br />The other actors range from solid to pretty good, and that's really the only thing keeping this a 2-star review. Expect a frustrating movie that features not only a main character that isn't sure what he is but also the actor himself.
0321934318|5.0|I love everything Scott Kelby writes.  He knows how to show, teach, and explain.  He does it both verbally and in written form.
B00AG472DS|5.0|(Note: I've forgone a synopsis, as they are readily available elsewhere.)<br /><br />This is my second favorite David Fincher film (behind Dragon Tattoo), which is saying something given his filmography.<br /><br />Zodiac takes a routine detective/true crime story and transforms it into a mesmerizing tale of consumption and obsession. The amount of detail the film throws at us is nothing short of brilliant, as we start to feel the overwhelming sense of urgency driving the investigation.<br /><br />Great performances, wonderful cinematography, and Fincher's direction clinch the 5-star rating. I don't want to pigeonhole him as a director, but Fincher really knows how to make crime mysteries.<br /><br />The &#34;basement&#34; scene instills so much tension every time I watch it, which is remarkable. Same with the opening murder. No scene is wasted, and there is always something to keep you glued to the film.<br /><br />Kudos the Fincher for one of the great true crime mysteries!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|What is not to like about NCIS I can watch it over and over and over<br />the team is a great mix
B001XUPH9K|4.0|My only experience with the Star Trek franchise is with J.J. Abrams' two installments. Never seen a single episode or movie from the other iterations.<br /><br />I get that starting with The Wrath of Khan means I miss out on some references and nuances that veterans enjoy. However, this is a goof first foray for newbies.<br /><br />The movie does an excellent job of establishing roles and relationships in meaningful ways. It has a compelling story. The cast give great performances.<br /><br />But more importantly, it leaves me wanting more. Star Trek III is up next immediately. Then maybe I can visit the original series.<br /><br />I can't offer a suggestion of The Wrath of Kahn's ranking in the series, but I can attest to its effectiveness both as a standalone film and a launching off point for those of us new to the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm enjoying playing this game. The story line is interesting. I like the puzzles within the game as well.  It's challenging without being frustrating.
1451695187|5.0|For the first time I really feel we know what Heaven is like.  It has made me look at death in a very different way.  Just after I read<br />it, my sister of 102+9Mo  died.  I accepted it as I knew where she was going and what it was like.  This book is  so real and<br />helpful.  I'd advise everyone to read it.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|Outstanding movie which follows the actual true story of Frida, a noted Mexican artist during a troubling time.<br /><br />It is full of interesting aspects of her life  and Salma played Friday perfectly even down to the single eye brow.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|I saw the ads for this movie and decided to buy it.  Boy, was I wrong about this flic !  It was really boring. Ugh!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A game that challenges your mind from start to finish. The Room makes you think in ways you normally may not to put a puzzle together that leads you to your next chapter. I absolutely love it and can't wait to purchase my next game from this series.
B00BSBXA98|4.0|I rented this movie or should I say video because I've enjoyed Cirque Du Soliel for years.  This version was very well done.  However, perhaps it's because I've come to enjoy more of a circus scenario with a story background.  This video is pure storyline.  Well done and excellent for family viewing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Loving the app. User friendly and helpful. I really appreciate the modern look and streamlined appearance. They really did a great job on this one.
B007STXHTM|5.0|This case is perfect to dive until 50m. Enogh for most of recreative dive. The case fixe perfect and it is important to buy a support togheter
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This was a very good book. A very fast paced book.  I can not wait to read the next one
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What were they thinking? The new app is less user friendly, harder to read thru flowers or whatever is supposed to be a background. Seems like lots of adds with the weather as an afterthought. I am deleting this immediately.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use to collect magazine clippings and recipes in a binder, what a disaster! Pinterest gives me the platform I need to collect my craft ideas or recipes and even occurred that brighten my day. I have numerous boards and refer to them a lot when buying new clothes, decor, or party ideas. Everyone should try pinterest and find the organization of your boards makes it a pleasure to use.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It is ok at sharpening blades. It doesnt do a spectacular job, but what do you expect for 6 bucks??? I noticed that there is some discoloration on the carbide inserts on mine. I dont know if thats normal or not. I used this on a Leatherman Sidekick but it wasnt able to sharpen the knife as it was when it came fresh out of the box. Make sure to read the directions because you need to use it on a flat surface, I didnt and the first thing I did with this is slice my knuckle open...
B0044WUQ3G|2.0|This is a ok horror film, in which people are stuck on a ski lift that has closed. That does happen. And it happened in Vail and the man on the lift had to jump off and he broke his spine. The lift operator was smoking pot and did that too him.  In this movie , they are in danger of freezing and then wolves come to attack them on the ground. Wolf attacks on living people are virtually unknown in reality.  but like the grey movie , they had to  have some kind of villain. So this is well shot and what is scary is the thought of being stuck on a lift. But the wolf attack idea was a add on.  The movie looks great in hd. ON dvd it's ok too.  It's not a flick that has a lot of action but then it's a fantasy film isn't it? .  So for some this is a boring flick. I just didn't like the wolf aspect. But then wolves are being killed for no reason in Alaska and that's not cool. Movies like this add to ammunition.
B00002MZ4V|4.0|This is a 2-CD set.  I really liked the first CD and could have done without the second one.  But, that is because I preferred the songs on the first CD, not the quality.  The sound was terrific and it was well worth the money.  For those of you who were lucky enough to see John Williams at Tanglewood, you will definitely want this for your collection.  It will come in handy in those cold winter months when you can only DREAM of hearing John Williams and the Pops on the Tanglewood lawn.
0887307280|4.0|This details why so many small businesses get hung-up and never prosper and languish or fail.  This is very helpful for anyone starting or running a small business.  Its a different way to look at what you do and how you do it.  I liked this alot.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Presents a sad time in our history with a little humor. Would recommend to any and everyone. A must see movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful music, amazing set and costumes not to mention outstanding actors.  I can't wait for season 4 to be released!  I love period dramas especially one as well written as this one.  Thank you Julian Fellowes and Amazon for making the original UK version available to us here in the States.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun but after awhile the challenge disappears. Bananas become useless and everything to keep the game going requires coins which you can only get by spending money! Maybe Bananas could be exchanged for coins to keep people playing???
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was entertained the whole time. Could not put the book down. A must read. A series that never stops hitting you in the face.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Actually I had to watch this on Netflix.  Amazon Prime kept dropping out on me when I tried to watch it past 2 or 3 episodes.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really love this game. I play it all the time. I would rather play this than any other game.It is very addictive, cause one you start poll using thou can't stop.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This little app is an essential FREE tool that takes the guess work out of how much is left before a recharge. Highly recommend!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it. it is soo fun. would play it anyday!! I recommend it for most ages. you have to have hand eye coordination.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome but I wish the mods were free because I don't have enough money to get any of them.<br />and I don't like that pocket edition isn't as cool as the versions for the x box and Pc. and there should be a version for the wii. but the game is cool.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|It does what it is designed to do.  Appears to hold the cards securely and it definitely is slim and compact.  Excellent size to fit in a compact camera case.
B00821OX98|4.0|Started slowly but built up interest as the episodes progressed.  Not as good as 24 which kept you riveted but worth the look.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so amazing ,cool ,and is fun despicable me is an good game to have and play cool
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa's voice is just like the title of the cd - velvet soul...  Absolutely love her music. Definitely ENJOY the cd..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an alright game. I rated it five stars because I can. But really I shouldn't it three because they frequently update the game and you lose alot of stuff you earned.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great acting, characters you care about, and the ultimate villains who want to wipe people off the face of the planet.  Tom Mason and sons maintain the family amid the devastation of an alien invasion.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Love the show!  Matt smith does a great job as the Dr.  He is not David Tennant but he does a great job.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It's OK, not wonderful. A little awkward at times - - I prefer &#34;Ask,&#34; but this was the first search engine I came to, and it IS free.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The personalities slowly grow on you, episode after episode, so that you find yourself not wanting it to end and looking forward to the next one.  Predictable? Yes, but delightful just the same.
030758836X|5.0|Flynn certainly did a great job of writing an entertaining story that causes the reader to consider his own use of manipulation in relationships!  Well done!
B004TNGLW0|1.0|I get to pay $255 for a movie that's on tv twice a week and the regular dvd is $5 at walmart - but here i can get it and some cards and an older dvd i'd never watch for $250 !!! Oh plus it comes with a box !!... Yes, i've been waiting for this deal ! I'm hoping GoodFellas goes on sale for $300 next week, a must have !
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old since he loved the first one. I would recommend this for any Pixar lover and collector :)
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It says it's free but asks me to buy points almost every day. I am NOT going to do that!
0920668372|5.0|This is such a sweet and amazing book. I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves when I read it to him. Would definitely recommend for any mom :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was interested in this book only after the media hyped it up so I decided to get the free sample. After I read the sample I was so pulled in I had to buy the book. I could not put my kindle down ended up buying the rest of the series and finished all three in five days. So good!
B005R32L66|1.0|I hate Skype, I dont know why anyone would use it, But I have friends in foreign places that need to use it to call me so I put up with its poor performance, and call quality.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I wanted to be open minded despite the fact that it stars Tom Cruise. I rather enjoyed _Minority Report_. It's what you should expect from having seen many other sci-fi films staring a &#34;teetering on the edge&#34; leading man. Only the acting was a bit worse than most. Channeling what I can only assume is an outdated boyishly cute quality didn't help Cruise in the first part of the film. The trait neither fit the plot nor his age.<br /><br />As for the plot, you can figure it out pretty quickly based on familiar idea that the main character's inner self is smarter, deeper and more selflessly heroic than the establishment. I can't help but think it's the same storyline as _The Last Samurai_. Though I could be mistaken; I've all but blocked that one from my memory. Only Tom Cruise has the skill and knowledge to save us in a world where Tom Cruise cannot and will not die. As usual, the film is unwillingly dominated by his presence, so it's difficult to say if any other cast members were good.
B005S0HNU2|5.0|Love the complete series so I've been buying the series as they become available. I can't wait to have the complete<br />series.<br /><br />Thanks<br />lyg66
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I am having trouble downloading the book I purchased from Pottermore.com<br />I don't know if it is the website or my experience.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I was excited to have a new movie I have all the books and dvds  LOTR, etc. The move was good, I guess I expected more because of the 3 previous  movies and it was lacing something.
B008M87GJK|5.0|As always the BBC is tops for clear and concise news delivery. Their news is better than most USA news broadcast.
B004LROMQG|5.0|love the series buying the complete series 1 year at a time because the complete series was not available at the time.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am enjoying this because before I had to go through all the annoyance of getting into yahoo, then my password etc., When now all I have to do is get on my Amazon Fire and tap and I am there.  Yes.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I can't wait to have the complete series. I'm in the process of getting the compete series then I'll have a Merlin Weekend  nothing but<br />Merlin until I get through all the series.<br /><br />Thanks<br />lyg662
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is worth being read several times as the lessons within about the human condition are timeless lessons we should pay close attention to.
B00471TLZS|4.0|because I liked this movie very much and I did recommend it to a friend that is why I purchased it.
