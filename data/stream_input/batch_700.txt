B00012FXAE|5.0|Cameron's excellent film is now made even better by adding fundamental elements that make more of an emotional connection to Ripley.  With the added material we get essential information on just WHY she connected to Newt so strongly.  Seeing Newt with her parents and brother on the planet adds a wonderful new dimension to an already outstanding film.  As Cameron says in the introduction (at least there's one on my quadrilogy set)  \\"this is the ride we intended you to take\\" and what a far more richer ride it is.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|Warner is apparently already going to re-issue this Blu-ray to match the features on the HD DVD.  I am shocked that Warner would do this to Blu-ray supporters.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|\\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is a descent re-telling of the epic poem \\"Beowulf,\\" the oldest poem written in the English language. While it isn't the best film ever made, it has an interesting premise: Grendel, a giant human, attempts to avenge the death of his father at the hands of King Hrothgar and his men, while the Geat warrior Beowulf comes to Hrothgar's kingdom to hunt him down. Gerard Butler is in top form as Beowulf, and Sarah Polley is beautiful in her role as a witch, while Hringur Ingvarsson gives us a Grendel who is not evil, but a man who seeks to kill the men who killed his father, who loved him deeply. In this film, the viewer will feel more inclined to cheer for Grendel than Beowulf, and that is to be expected.<br />The problems with the film stem from the choppy editing, which could confuse the viewer if he doesn't pay attention all the way through. Also, with the dialects in the film, viewers might find a hard time understanding what some of the characters are saying. There is also a limited amount of action in the film, so some will find the film dull.<br />Overall, this is an O.K. rendering of the heroic story to the screen. It's a good movie for everyone to view once.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B-
B00000273P|2.0|I've only been able to stomach listening to this album a few times.  Maybe it will get better with a few more repeated listenings.  My impression of this album is that it was worked on until all life was removed from the music.  It's as glisten-y as anything I've heard.  Shiny, cliche, uninteresting.    Maybe some of the lyrics make up for its soulless, keyboard demo-y sheen.  I can't focus on lyrics until I've listened repeatedly a number of times, and well, each song it like eating a Twinkie.  Like that paragon of artificiality, ingesting more than a few of these songs at a time is sure to make you feel queasy.  I'm saddened that Thomas Dolby produced this since he can be absolutely brilliant, but I'm not feeling that brilliance here.  \\"There is such a fine line between between stupid and clever\\" (to quote Spinal Tap).  And I'm afraid this pushed that line too far.    Some highlights:    1. Looking for Atlantis.  \\"Woo woo woo.  Woo woo woo\\" (echo echo echo).  Smarmy.  Pristine.  Repetitive.  Not very melodic, but maybe there is a tolerable song in here somewhere.    2. Wild Horses. \\"Yeaah Bee-atch.\\"  A smarmily sensitive rap/R&B number full of sampled falsetto and gated-sounding keyboard pads.  Move over Prince, your plastic version is here.    3. Machine Gun Ibiza.  Nice wah in here at some point.  Again, trying to be artificially soulful.  Square cotton candy R&B.    4. We Let the Stars Go.  I can almost see this as a standard Prefab Sprout song only it has a static, slow drum machine pattern against smarm.    5. Carnival 2000. The first 30 seconds of this song got me excited with a minimal arrangement that exposed the voice and had some feeling.  Then, Gah.  I'm hit with a cliche salsa drum pattern complete with whistles and hand clap noises.  Seriously, was this dialed up from some drum preset?  Still, this has been the most listenable song on the album yet.    6. Jordan: The Comeback.  Start with some faux-hip talking.  Unmelodic and boring verses with more talking in between.  Oooh, modulation midway.  Repeat some more boring stuff.  Static, square drum machine pattern.    7. Jesse James Symphony.  This short thing has shiny keyboard notes following the vocal line. Meh.    8. Jesse James Bolero.  I'll give a point for creativity, but the bolero part sounds like it's being played by a high-fidelity hallmark card.    9. Moondog. Start with some swirly pads and an exposed vocal line.  Not bad. Then chuck in some tinny synth piano and squeaky cheese filled synth horns. \\"Mooooooondog\\" chorus bit doesn't pay off too well.  It's sorta boring and repetitive.  You could almost see a good song in here somewhere.  It just didn't quite come out.    10. All the World Loves Lovers. \\"Don't forget it.\\"  I could see this coming off one of their other albums since it has some similarities, only this has uninteresting and weak lyrics.  Oh, there is that canned and repetitive drum machine again.    11. All Boys Believe Anything. An odd little 90 second interlude that should have come from Peter Pan if it didn't.  It's ok, all 90 seconds of it. Unfortunately it's one of the best things yet on this album.    12. The Ice Maiden.  Some interesting scraping sounds.  You can almost hear a good song somewhere in here.  Gah, there is that uninteresting, plodding drum pattern again.  Stop the boring and uninspired plodding already.    13. Paris Smith. Why don't I just talk a bit in wandering vocal lines?  Innocuously boring.    Bleh.  I have to stop there. That's about all I can stand listening to.  I just can't listen any longer.  Who knows what the last six songs are like.    If they're like what has happened until now, I don't particularly need to hear any more.    Sadly, I want to like this album and even put in a number of listenings while actively trying to like it.  I just can't recommend it.  Go buy Steve McQueen or Swoon since both are much better albums and haven't been sprinkled with sap and boredom.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Firstly I have to state that this is not just one of my all-time favourite Beefheart albums, it is one of my all-time favourite albums full-stop.     It has got it all, strange yet very easy to like, and with repeated listening it grows and grows. I never tire of hearing it.   Why was I going to give four stars, not five?   Well one reviewer says that a plus-point with this release is that it is 70+mins long whereas the original is 34 mins long.   Well the extra material added here adds NOTHING to the original. Worse it actually takes up valuable time you could spend listening to something worthwhile (like the proper album for example).   If you read the notes that come with the album they actually tell you that the tracks here belong with the \\"Mirror Man\\" LP and were tacked on to this album for no other reason than that there wasn't enough space on that CD for the material (clearly they realised that a double CD of (mostly) mediocre improvised pieces was not going to sell) so they, no doubt, figured that sticking an, apparent multitude, of 'previously unreleased bonus material' on the end of an established masterpiece might persuade some long-time lovers of the album to buy it again (yes I feel like a mug).     Here's the justification: The Captain recorded studio tracks at this time with the intention of producing a double LP which was to feature live material recorded later. For reasons unknown this didn't happen. So in adding this material, the suggestion is that it is somehow honouring the artist's original intent.   Phooey! The reason they didn't go ahead with the 'original concept' is that someone realised it would be a dreadful mistake. The material added here sounds completely out of keeping with the rest of the album, but does sound very much in keeping with the recordings on \\"Mirror Man\\" (a very much inferior album). Oh and let's not forget these are the rejects from THAT album.     As for the much-vaunted re-mastering, when played back-to-back this version does sound superior, on a first listen, to the previous CD version. That is until you realise that it is mostly due to the effect of ramping up the volume (as is the case with a lot of re-mastering jobs) a process that may actually reduce the dynamic range of the material, when the playing volume is adjusted to compensate there is no discernible improvement(or reduction) in quality.     In spite of the above I am forced to wholeheartedly recommend the album (unless you own or can obtain the earlier CD version in which case you can rest easy) as it is one of the greats. I would, however, suggest you familiarise yourself with the first twelve tracks and treat the interlopers present after them with extreme caution.     There is no way I could ever give less than five stars to any version of this album.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|Even if they don't credit \\"The Deep\\" this movie had to have been seen by the writers before turning out the screenplay.     Young treasure hunters (a buff Paul Walker and the stunning Jessica Alba) find an old pirate shipwreck and also a plane with cocaine on it near by the ship. With a money grubbing friend (Scott Caan looking and acting very much like his father James), the go for the treasure, but not before Caan takes some of the coke to sell and raise money for the recovery of the gold. But guess what,every dealer in the area also wants it and the action is under way.       Sure it's just a cotton candy movie(after it's over you are still hungry), but it's fun and fast paced. Give it a try.
B000PHX8C0|5.0|Without a doubt the heaviest of the three albums, DevilDriver has really nailed it home with \\"Last Kind Words\\". The CD is intense and, for lack of a better term, driving. It truly seems like DD has found their niche, and is quickly becoming the forefront of a new wave of metal to-come. Their combination of melodic, death, and thrash metal is brilliantly refined and fuses seamlessly. After first popping in the CD, you will instantly be blown away by the first track \\"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\\". You'll instantly notice the CD kicks off fast, hard, and heavy. The pace WILL create uncontrollable body movements, believe you me, and does a fantastic job of drawing you in.    \\"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\\" is DevilDriver's first single of the CD, and with good reason. The lyrics are much more intelligent and well thought-out in comparison to the self-titled album and \\"The Fury of Our Maker's Hand\\". You will also notice the band got a little carried away with guitar solos, however, they definitely add a unique flavor to each song. The next of my favorites is \\"Clouds Over California\\" which is eargasmic. The track truly displays the band's skill as a whole. \\"Horn Of Betrayal\\", \\"These Fighting Words\\", and \\"Head On To Heartache (Let Them Rot)\\" are also just as equally amazing.    Overall, I am becoming more and more blown away with each album. Long live DevilDriver.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|David Fincher has brought the \\"True Crime Movie\\" back form the dead. This is one of the best \\"Crime Thrillers\\" in many-a-moon.        The story is about the hunt for a killer and not about a killer. We follow two reporters(the incredible Robert Downey and a very good Jake Gyllenhaal) and a cop(Mark Ruffalo in the best performance of the movie(and that is saying a lot) as they chase,stumble,backtrack, and slowly lose everything they have chasing the elusive and sneering killer who dares anyone to find him. Leads grow cold and \\"flakes\\" of all kind come out of the woodwork as the killings intensified, making the hunt that much slower. The cost to the men is what really makes the movie. Down beat to be sure, but shows how one person even in death affects other lives. Mark Ruffalo ages decades as his life disappears in front of him, and you feel his agony as he tries to catch this madman.      The whole movie grabs you and pulls you along with it and never lets the tension leave you. One of the best
B00004HYLF|5.0|This is Return To Forever's best album. I have all of them and have been a fan for a long time. Everything came together with this recording.

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I hadn't seen this film in 20 years and I am amazed at how well it has held up! Macchio and Morita give excellent performances in this \\"Rocky\\" type underdog movie for kids.

It has made me want to re-visit the whole series!....Here we go again!
B000002GB9|4.0|At their worst, Styx are Spinal Tap with bigger hair (see \\"I'm Okay\\" off of \\"Pieces of Eight\\" for a hilarious example) and sometimes Dennis DeYoung can be a little lazy in his writing (\\"on board I'm the captain/so climb aboard\\") but this is a fine album from an interesting band. The melodies are catchy and the songs have some (albeit simplistic) insights into Western culture. Sure, it lacks the rapier-like deconstructionism of \\"Big Bottoms\\" and \\"Stonehenge\\" off of Spinal Tap's debut but who could hope to meet that standard?  It's eight bucks. Buy it!
0452286751|1.0|A mix of unbelievable soap opera and long-winded philosophical rants about the supremacy of the individual, this book's sole redeeming value is that the protagonist, Howard Roarke, is to some large degree modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright. When you look at it from a FLW perspective there is a bit of interest in the story. Beyond that, a bloated overrated mess.
0671027344|5.0|he wrote a book  And he called it \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\"    In the same vein as books like Catcher in the Rye, Stephen Chbosky weaves the tale of Charlie during his freshman year of high school. But this is not the fluff of young adult fiction, not by a long shot. This is life-changing stuff if you let it be, and Charlie opens your eyes to the world in a way that it had been invisible before. When he walks down the halls in the fall you feel his solitude; when his friends graduate in the spring, you can't believe a year has passed in the short time the book has been in your hands.    Without question, this is my favorite book of all time. Sure, there may be more eloquent books, or books with more clever plotlines, or books where the characters end up heroes. But nothing beats the sheer honesty of Charlie and his letters.

B000R8YC3G|5.0|I do not usually watch &#34;horror&#34; movies, and this movie is perfect for people like me.  Though it is definitely &#34;R&#34; in the language used and the scary/gorey scenes, there is enough hilarity to carry people like me through. It is, to me, more genuinely scary than &#34;Scary Movie&#34;, and it is also more genuinely funny than &#34;Scary Movie&#34;. I have given &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; to two people as gifts, and recommend it as a movie that does not pretend to be anything more than what it is.<br /><br />Happy Reader
0393061310|5.0|Where does inequality between human beings comes from? Is it natural, or an artifact of ours institutions? May we blame it on capitalism, or on the evilness of human nature? For Jared Diamond, we should blame geography on the first place. As reductionist and deterministic as it sounds, his thesis proves to be both comprehensive and well founded. The great basic inequality we have in the world today are between Eurasians (and their descendents) and non-Eurasians (and their descendents), but the reason has nothing to with race or genetics, so this casts a light on the future of mankind. On the other hand, Diamond points out obstacles that have grow on centuries of separation. The reason the book seems repetitive to some is because it is packed with data and detailed in its analysis. He exposes his basic thesis on the first chapters, and details it for each continent in the rest of the book. A must read for anyone interested in history, humanity, poverty, politics, anthropology or sociology. Very eye opening, informative and well written. I have read the Brazilian Portuguese translation of it.
B000K15VSA|2.0|First, a disclaimer.  I am in no way related to the Tyrell Corporation that is in \\"Blade Runner,\\" but since the names are so similar, people are always asking me questions about it.  Consequently, I've become quite an expert on the movie over the years, but I am in no way affiliated with the movie.  And thank Godness!    This movie is a science fiction movie, but there are not any kind of cool laser fights or villainous aliens like you would expect in any movie from the genre.  In fact, the plot revolves around Harrison Ford walking around and whispering in the rain and then...oh wait a minute.  That's all that happens!  Oh, and Darryl Hannah does some backflips that are actually pretty cool.  Other than that, though, this movie fails on most levels and especially I don't like Rutger Howard.    In the future, according to this movie, there are robots and evil people and somehow they are all outsmarting Harrison Ford.  This is very hard to believe, because if you've ever seen \\"Presumed Innocent\\" or \\"Working Girl\\" or \\"Six Days, Seven Nights,\\" then you know that it is very very tricky to outsmart Harrison Ford, especially when he is at the top of his game.    If they decide to make a Blade Runner II (and I'm sure they will) what they should do is give Harrison Ford a funny sidekick like Chris Tucker who says wisecracks while they are tracking down the robots.  Then it would be a charming movie, instead of a depressing rainy mess, which is what this is.  I'm sure by the time we reach the year that this movie takes place (in the future), there probably will be flying cars and such, but I would guess that at the very least we will have figured out a way to make it a little sunnier.  Note to scientists: work on making more sun for the future, and please don't work on Blade Runner II!    I like my future bright like in \\"Back to the Future II\\" or \\"Back to the Future III\\"
B00005M91K|2.0|I am not sure what all the hype was about.  This is a strange movie that is very disjointed and has a very odd flow to it.  The music is also odd.  I realize that it is suppose to be art, but I was expecting something that would be relaxing and this is not.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|\\"Absolute Garbage\\" is Garbage's greatest hits disc. This special edition adds a CD of remixes.<br /><br />The first disc is a spectacular, single-disc summary of this extraordinary band. Nobody sounds like Garbage. You know a Garbage song the instant you hear it.<br /><br />First, there's the amazing Miss Manson. She joins a very small club of female rock singers that rise effortlessly above their peers...we're talking Chrissie Hynde...and then that's pretty much it. She's that good.<br /><br />The rest of the band are no less tremendous. MAN can they make a lot of glorious noise! So many of these songs have irresistible hooks, earth-shaking sonics, walls of guitars and synths...drums that come from, oh, I dunno, magma? They come from nowhere...from somewhere below...and then explode with a fierce inevitability. Check out the fireworks on \\"Rains\\" or \\"Push It\\" or even \\"When I Grow Up.\\"<br /><br />Layer on that these anthemic choruses and terrific melodies, and you have some of the best rock music of the last decade.<br /><br />The disc does a good job summarizing their four albums, and as any true fan, I have my quibbles over song selection. But they are just that: quibbles. Of a fan. Of a particularly fussy fan.<br /><br />The remixes are superfluous. Worse that that, they're just bad. Now don't get me wrong: I love remixes. They can make a good song more interesting, longer for added enjoyment, or they can present an overly familiar song in a fresh manner so you can like it all over again.<br /><br />Yeah, well, none of that sort of stuff happens here.<br /><br />For me, the second disc could have been a live disc, or more songs, like \\"Supervixen\\" or \\"Androgyny\\". Or the DVD of the videos. Which I also bought.<br /><br />But as it stands, that one disc is pretty darn awesome. You cannot lose with songs like \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" (how wonderful would it have been to have, say, the Hynde/Manson duet version from VH1 here?), \\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Special\\", \\"Cherry Lips\\", \\"Bleed Like Me\\"...<br /><br />I really hope they're not broken up for good. In this era of disposable pop, there simply isn't enough of this good stuff to go around.this era of disposable pop, there simply isn't enough of this good stuff to go around.
B000RJO58M|5.0|This is an excellent send up of Cop movies.  However, let me get this straight:  it is not as funny as Shaun of the Dead, the first movie this great group came up with.  However, it is still much better than most of the movies out there.<br /><br />Shaun of the Dead is much funnier with each successive viewing.  I think this flick might be the same.  There are some great bits that I won't give away here.<br /><br />So let's talk about the HD DVD, since that is the version I got (I don't think it is out on Blu Ray).  The transfer is awesome... the best I have seen thus far.  No visible lines or... er... fuzz.  Sound is excellent.  I hear the extras are to die for, but I haven't had a chance to dive into those:  four different audio commentaries, lots of shows, and other bits.  Also, of course, Picture in picture extras which Blu ray just can't do right now.<br /><br />Movie 4.0 (it's a bit predictable-- but still fun to watch)<br />HD transfer 5 (It's perfect)<br />Sound 5<br />All in all 5.0.  Great movie.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|Kudos to Sony for reissuing this 22-disc set of the recorded legacy of Stravinsky.  Originally retailing for $350, the pricing of this set at under $50 is an absolute steal.  The packaging is decidedly economical with no frills - a simple box wherein each cd is housed in a cardboard sleeve.  Each sleeve features a photograph of Stravinsky during the recording sessions.  Though the set comes with an overview booklet, the major drawback of this reissue is that it does NOT include any program notes or libretti.  The original set was replete with detailed and comprehensive annotations, as well as the complete libretti for all of the vocal works.  I would gladly have paid more for the inclusion of these vitals.  Still, the 'bang for the buck' factor wins all.  The pieces are grouped as follows:    BALLETS AND BALLET SUITES  SYMPHONIES, REHEARSALS AND TALKS  CONCERTOS  MINIATURE MASTERPIECES  CHAMBER MUSIC AND HISTORICAL RECORDINGS  OPERAS  35 SONGS  ORATORIO - MELODRAMA  SACRED WORKS  ROBERT CRAFT CONDUCTS UNDER THE SUPERVISI0N OF IGOR STRAVINSKY    The sound quality is admirable, the performances respectable (though the Columbia Symphony can be inconsistant), and with Stravinsky at the helm, these recordings are more than just a definitive historical document.  It allows us to rediscover and fully appreciate the entire span of Stravinsky's musical life and genius.
0061120073|5.0|For anyone who believes in the power of words to shape and transform, this book is a \\"must read.\\" It is stirring and rich, steeped in history and immensely entertaining. A really good book has the ability to make us understand life better. This is one such book.  I learned so much about history from this book, as Smith brings color and depth into each page of her story with vivid details of the culture, the habits and the mores of the day. Her characters are strong, weak, flawed...utterly human. I was also reminded of the complexities of the human condition. Timeless issues make this book relevant to readers of any age in any decade. I savored Smith's style rather like one eats a really good chocolate, slowly as to truly experience its richness. I read this book in less than 48 hours; now, a week later, I'm re-reading it carefully with the intent of teaching it. It is my hope my own daughters will read it, as it presents as clear a picture of living, and as powerful a message about family and sacrifice, as I have ever encountered.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|AFTER THE WEDDING ('Efter brylluppet') is a brilliant work, a two hour synthesis of life that demands our full attention and rewards that attention with some of the finest ensemble acting, directing, dialogue and message that we have come to expect from Danish writer/director Susanne Bier (Anders Thomas Jensen is also credited with the story concept). It is a film that raises difficult questions and situations and somehow pulls us into a world of damaged people about whom we genuinely care.<br /><br />Jacob (a stellar performance by Mads Mikkelsen) is a solitary soul who has found a niche in India as a teacher and caregiver in an orphanage. When he is informed that a wealthy donor is considering being a benefactor, Jacob leaves the children he loves to return to his native Denmark to the home of the potential donor Jørgen (another fine performance by Rolf Lassgård) and his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen): in Jacob's past he had been lovers with Helene while both were in India). A major event is in the offing - the marriage of 20-year-old Anna - Stine Fischer Christensen - (Jørgen and Helene's daughter) and feisty Christian (Christian Tafdrup).  The only character who does not seem to have a secret is Jørgen's mother (Mona Malm) who suffers from mild dementia.  It should be a happy occasion, but after the wedding old wounds are uncovered, long secrets are discovered, and nothing is as it seems.  Jacob, now confronted with strange realities, longs to return to his Indian orphanage, but Jørgen manipulates his gift of money in a way that uncovers even more secrets. The multiple surprises that occur rapid fire keep the plot and character development spinning until the film closes with such grace that the audience is left stunned.<br /><br />As the current barrage of summer movies assault our senses, making us wonder about the mental hunger for films less than challenging, along comes the release of this magnificent work and reassures us that the era of superb cinema has not dissolved into cartoons.  AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, July 07olved into cartoons.  AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, July 07

B000E6ESL2|5.0|Stay starring Ryan Gosling, Ewan McGregor, and Naomi Watts is a tricky, strange, and fascinating film to say the least. Stay is still a bit confusing and you are never really sure which story is real, the end or the beginning but I liked this movie because you the viewer is left to ponder who's reality is the most accurate. Naomi Watts turns in another star-making performance and Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. If you enjoy a good and well-made pyschological thriller then Stay is for you. I highly recommend checking this film out, it's thrilling!
B000R7I3LY|3.0|Sara Bareilles' debut album is indeed better than most new CDs, but please do not compare her to Fiona Apple, Tori Amos or even Sarah McLachlan. She does NOT have either the talent or energy of the above mentioned singers, nor is she as good to listen to on record.<br /><br />I got this CD solely based on the wonderful reviews on this Amazon page. Pity, because I wish I hadn't. Which brilliant mind compared her to Fiona Apple? At best, Sara sounds like something off a `Dawson's Creek' episode from the late 1990s (and not in a good way). Yes, the voice is pretty - but it is NOT unique. In fact, listening to this album in its' entirety, I was constantly reminded of one performer - Vanessa Carlton. Then I realized that Vanessa had both a better voice and better songs, but that Bareilles was so intent on winning her audience, that it really shows in places.<br /><br />Best track of the album - `Vegas' - is one where she sounds a lot like Jessica Simpson attempting that Dolly Parton song. I mean this in a nice way. The song is memorable, and if I was to ever reach for this album again (which is looking very unlikely at this point), `Vegas' will be the track I shall be playing.<br /><br />Heres the thing - this is a very average album. Neither is Sara a `real find' or the `real deal' as people would have you believe, nor is she especially talented. I think the latter is the thing that will make people realize she isn't going to have a career as cult-like as Fiona or Tori. Reviewers, please don't compare singers like Sara to the greats - its not justified by any means.<br /><br />Download a track or two, if you must, but refrain from buying this. It isn't that good.
B000RJO578|5.0|That's kind of a surprising thing to hear, no? When you consider how many romantic comedies and whatnot that have been released this year, you'd think I'd have laughed more. Well, sort of. Some of them, such as Catch and Release and Because I Said So were not that funny or even charming (although I can stare at Mandy Moore all day). But now and then you see one that makes you forget all the bad ones you've seen and while it does have its flaws, Hot Fuzz is probably one of the funnier movies this year, and strangely enough, one of the better action ones too.    Nicholas Angel is a remarkably talented police officer with exceptional skills and a strong devotion to the law. However this creates jealousy among the other London cops since he makes them look worse by comparison so they ship him off to the small town of Stanford, known for its low crime rate and multiple \\"Village of the Year\\" wins. Many in town are not too excited to have him there and friend Danny is the only one who follows him which is helpful since a number of murders have been happening. Who's behind it and can Nick get through the town's ineptitudes to solve the case?    The last time director Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost made a comedic film was with the surprise hit, Shaun of the Dead. Combining horror violence with comedy, it was a nice mix although at times the horror kind of overtook the comedy parts. Now they've combined comedy with action movies, namely the buddy films with 2 cop partners having to solve a case and blow stuff up too. Here, it's used to great effect and while some jokes don't work (a mumbling farmer for one) you have others that are just hysterical. I bet lot of you will start quoting the \\"yarp/narp\\" thing after watching this.     But how about the action? Well it mainly pops up at the end and until then we get some graphic murders that while nowhere the level of Hostel (although one involving a rooftop is a doozy), the film picks up at the end where it actually becomes exciting. Imagine that: a great shootout in a comedy movie. Sacre bleu! While it does do that quick editing used by a lot of new directors. you never lose track of the events. If there's one thing that slightly takes the film down is the pacing at the beginning. While I don't mind films that take awhile for the \\"real stuff\\" to get going such as Aliens which took near an hour for the first sign of the thing to show up, here it feels kind of long.    Acting-wise you can always rely on the group to be funny without being less than real people. Simon Pegg for instance who played kind of a well-meaning slacker in Shaun plays the serious-as-hell Nicholas and he pulls if off without being unintentionally funny. We also get cameos from Bill Nighy of Dead Man's Chest/At World's End fame, Martin Freeman of the British version of the Office, Timothy Dalton and apparently even Peter Jackson in a quick cameo.    Funny enough, released the same day as this on DVD was 300, a movie that wanted to be an epic even though it was strictly base entertainment. But for some reason Hot Fuzz is a comedy movie that kind of becomes a bit more. It's probably not the most important comedy this year but it's surely the funniest.
0062502174|5.0|No spoilers.    If you're reading these online reviews in order to determine if you'll like The Alchemist based off of what others thought about it, then you're probably a little confused right now. The best advice on this I can give is that if you read it and like it/love it like many people here, then obviously you'll be happy with your choice, but if you read it and don't like it/hate it, it's not a big deal because it's one of the shorter quality novels you'll ever come across at only 192 pages.    Having said that, I'm adding to the hype about this book by saying that I can't recall coming across novel with such presence and thought in such a simple form. One negative reviewer claimed reading this was like reading a high school book report, and the odd thing about that comment is, while I can see where a comment like that would come from due to simplicity of the writing style, the thoughts behind the words come from nothing less than a great thinker.    If you're skeptical about reading this book, please just ignore the reviews (I guess that would mean mine too :] ) and take the chance to do it for yourself. Will this book change your life? No. Is it the best most ispirational book ever written. Well that's subjective, but for me, no. It's just a great book to step away from your hectic world with for an evening (and believe me, you probably will finish this in an evening), so give it a try.
B000M341QE|1.0|Got to say I started watching this without knowing it was a Scorsese film. It took me about half an hour before I started thinking \\"Something familiar about all this\\"  Quick look on the back of the DVD and yep, Scorsese.<br /><br />Sorry but all this rubbish about him being some great director, it just amazes me that nobody seems to see through his pathetic one dimentional films.  The usual 'wise guys' 'kid growing up in 'da neighbourhood' with the 'local hoods' 'trying to make it good' everybody talking out the side of their mouths in some laughable pathetic attempt to rip off 1930s gangster movies.  Someone made a point of Scorsese being 'anti religion' I would have to ask what does Scorsese have against black people?  In almost every film he produces blacks/latinos pretty much anyone non white seems to be either devoid of any intelligence or topless dancers.  In almost all his films they are refered to using the 'n' word (even in this one in the first few lines of the film when there is not even a black person in sight!) The driver in Goodfellas after pulling off the biggest highjack in US history then gets drunk and falls asleap in the getaway car (as you do like!) I mean was he dropped by a black person as a baby or something?<br /><br />The film is just awful.  Can Scorsese not think of anything else or has he given up hope after his pathetic attempt at looking at theology with last temptation?<br /><br />So whats the film about?  Usual gangster drivel.  This time instead of Italian 'wise guys' it's the Irish.  Instead of going back in time and having poor Daniel Day Lewis speak with some stupid accent where he cant make out if he is an Al Capone gangster or a fishmonger from Sunderland or Vegas with Casino.  Blah blah baseball bat scene, Jewish bookmaker pointless anti semitism, blah blah blah......  This time we move to Boston (exactly the same set up though) Think I lost count of the amount of times in the first 20 odd minutes of the film they made a point of refering to themselves as Irish with the usual Irish stereotypes.  Irish jokes, the IRA, the Irish 'hood' 'Irish are all drunks' 'Irish are all mad' even the 'Irish president' for Gods sake.  Yeh so what you come from Boston so your great great grandfathers sisters aunties best friends cat once had some connection with Ireland so what?  Some would think that afer the 3 or 4 odd generations they would not be still speaking with Irish accents and if they did they could have at lest got Irish actors instead of American making a pathetic attempt at being Irish.<br /><br />Cop who grew up in the 'Irish hood' goes undercover to investigate local Irish gangster.  Cant realy say much more about the story line because their isnt one.  Just a complete waste of such a great actor as Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />Give it up Scorsese, Goodfellas was a great film but thats about it.

B000K15VSA|5.0|Holy of holy's!  I thought I would never see the day!  I have been monitoring the whispers and murmurings of this being released for the past ten years.  The Sergio Leone, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Kenneth Anger box sets all released in the same year...AND NOW THIS!  I think I might faint!  Along with many of you, I saw it in the theaters as a kid and remember being overwhelmed with conflicting emotions.  On that day my world was changed forever.  What a tragic, tragic Promethean tale. It will stand as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century, and possibly beyond.  It is easily in the same pantheon as Metropolis and 2001.    If I were to offer any minor short comings, of this set not the movie, it would have been nice for them to have added the soundtrack.  Who knows maybe they will release a special version of the soundtrack as well.    I just wanted to say thank you to brmovie.com for all of the years of hope and dedication.

B000RJO57I|2.0|I actually live in the UK and like a lot of British films, but I just did not find this film that funny.  I got the jokes, they just weren't great. The film is an action/comedy, but the unique blend just didn't work for me.  The action wasn't great action and the comedy (mostly) wasn't great comedy.  I do like the general story idea (of a small, traditional, moral town being exposed as evil to the core), but the way it was told just didn't click for me.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|After spending hour after hour re-reading Robert Graysmith's novels on Zondiac, I was extremely excited when news of this movie's release was announced. It is an outstanding portrayal of how obsession can overtake one's lilfe if one is not careful. The writing is excellent, as is the acting, and the attention to detail is superb. My problem with the DVD release is the puzzling lack of extras. It is standard to include commentaries and behind the scenes shorts when releasing DVDs, yet this DVD has nothing. It forces one to buy this disc in case there is no future release, and if there is a future release, you're now stuck with two copies and generally have wasted the money for this disc. I would rather have waited for a proper DVD to come out rather than having to shell out more money when (if) they put out a disc filled with extras.
B000002GB4|5.0|This is where it begins for Tommy Shaw.  This is a spectacular effort by the band.  John C. has departed and in comes in Shaw with his knack of capturing the top 40 hit.  On this release though that never really happened so this may be considered a warm-up to their next, 'The Grand Illusion'.  Lead off song \\"Put Me On'another James Young classic and can still say that after all these years the song still rocks.  This is the album also, that sees James Young starting to take a backseat on lead vocals.  As on their first four albums James Young was very prevalent on lead, but as success found its way with the band DeYoung and Shaw capture the spotlight for the top 40 hits that keep the band selling millions of records.  I always like to link albums together as must have's.  If you have one then you must have another because they just go together.  If you pick up 'Crystal Ball' then please pick up 'Equinox' also.  They have a certain flavor to them and they rock.  Nothing bad here on this cd.
B000P2A24W|5.0|There's one thing I want to say, so I'll be brave. Basically, I don't know how many times I kept on trying and kept on failing and failing and trying and failing in order to make certain dream come true. Sometimes it's better to sink than to swim. Thankfully, Bon Jovi doesn't subscribe to this advice. I was once told in confidence that he does, but this propitious slab proves that his artistic compass could indeed see land. Tracks like \\"Vanishing Horse\\" and \\"Ditching a Plane For Cat Food\\" are the immediate standouts, highlighting Bon's enthusiasm for the novelty hits of yesteryear. But \\"jack'round\\" music is not the only boring part here. Bon begins to put all his eggs in the most fearsome basket of all by track 3, the thunderous and ivy-covered \\"False Hope.\\" I thought that was the most awesome song there was at the time. It is  an anti-Irish diatribe in the spirit of \\"Firecrotch\\" from his 1976 masterpiece \\"Pussy Heaven,\\" but this time the unsuspecting targets are Chinese railroad workers of the late 1800's. Heartfelt verses give way to the rousing, chanted chorus of \\"go home or effing die!\\" Over and over. Yeah. Sometimes I hear a CD and I think that nothing could ever be as good as this. Well, that's what I thought about this one. \\"Final Approach\\" is the best song. It's a heavy rocker in the spirit of Century or Robust Rufus, and probably the most emotionally-healthy breakup song I've heard to date. And I've heard a lot of emotionally-healthy breakup songs. I assume this was written to deal with the death and Co-dine overdose of Bon's second wife, Marie, in August. I was made to understand that he was so excited by her magnetism and the intensity of her speech methods, but especially by the power of the images she was capturing in her \\"beat poetry.\\" Then the whole damn thing basically all goes downhill from there. Awesome record, though. The only thing that offended me about this slab was all the thinly-veiled jabs at the mentally retarded population. Hitler was NOTright, Bon! LOL Oh, well.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Awesome is the only word that I can think of to describe The Blackening, the music and the vocals are really incredible, this album as far as heavy goes is simply pure metal and brutality from the opening of \\"Clenching the Fists of Descent\\" to the end of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\"also I would like to add that the melodic parts of the album are great, but it's still heavy. Overall I would rate this album 10/10 because the musicianship is tight on the album, the speed of the guitar, bass, and drums mixed in with the melodic parts are incredible, and also the way the vocals range growls and screams to the clear singing is really good. I would highly recomend this album to anyone who would ask me about itand to those who check this album out you will not be disappointed.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best ever action movies, of all time. When the king of Sparta wishes to defend his land, and his people against overwhelming odds of the incoming Persian army. He is avised that he cannot send the Spartan Army, so he \\"Goes for a stroll, with 300 bodyguards.\\" In order to defend all that is at their core, to the death if that is what it takes. Breathtakingly stunning visual effects, and some cool as hell battle sequences that are on par with special effects like the matrix. Extraordinary! On this edition, the only special feature is commentary if that is your thing, if you want more, seek out another version, like the 2 disc sp edition. Otherwise this is one fantastic movie, that goes on my list as a best, favorite!
B000RO9PXC|4.0|I'm writing this review so those who are skeptical or hesitant about purchasing this release might better appreciate what to do instead of regretting it later. The shows recorded at Boston were part of a number of shows professionally recorded by the band for a future live release. Jim was an alcoholic and he did get drunk at SOME of the Doors live performances. If you don't want to hear what a drunk Jim Morrison sounds like, then definitely purchase Live at Detroit and you will get a much better performance from Morrison and the band in general. However, if you dare cross the line and dwell in the \\"loose palace of exile\\" you might find yourself surprisingly entertained by the Doors live at Boston. First off, the mix of this recording definitely fits the setting. The Doors played in an arena and what you get is \\"arena sound.\\"  It makes for great listening if you turn it WAY UP!!!  John Densmore's drums are mixed front and center and it sounds great!  As for the shows:<br /><br />The howl and moan by Jim at the start of the first set is quite a pleasure to listen to and it sets the stage for a ballsy Road House Blues which follows immediately after. Ship of Fools is well performed by the band and Jim is able to sing most of the lyrics, albeit in inebriated form. I won't review each and every song but sufficit to say, as long as you don't mind the grunts and slurs and yells by Jimbo, and you crank this recording LOUD, you will have a FUN TIME!  No one in the audience could have cared less if Jimbo was drunk as a skunk! The Doors bravely carry on, juiced Jimbo and all. In the second set, Jim is even drunker BUT he's capable of reciting poetry, (graveyard poem) and it's a beautiful one at that! He also raps with the audience and you get the feel of BEING in the audience thanks to Bruce Botnick's sound mix. I can imagine how the audience was having a fun time at this show and were rightly PISSED OFF when the management cut the power because the Doors went \\"overtime\\"  When you hear Jimbo say [...] once the power is cut, you can hear how upset the audience was at seeing the Doors being prevented from playing further!<br /><br />The Doors don't perform every song well and do show some noticeable deficiencies and you can hear some flubs in many of the tunes performed. But hey, this is LIVE and not every show is going to be performed to PERFECTION. If you want a more \\"perfect LIVE Doors experience\\" than go purchase \\"Absolutely Live.\\" This is Live in BOSTON and the suds flow during this show and Jimbo has a whale of a time performing live in front of his fans. This is a must release for hardcore Doors fans and an important release to fill in the picture of Jim Morrison, one of the more complicated, colorful and talented artists of the late 1960's.hear Jimbo say [...] once the power is cut, you can hear how upset the audience was at seeing the Doors being prevented from playing further!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|This has been a really dismal year for film so far... but this movie ranks up there among the best of them. Despite having some slight flaws and a soundtrack that could have been far better, I really liked this movie... It's in the similar vein of stuff like JFK where you feel like there is a huge mystery unfolding before your very eyes, and even though the answers that are given in this film are purely hypothetical (much like JFK), one cannot help but to still be enticed and intrigued by the subject matter as a whole. I really think that this is Fincher's best film since Se7en (I found Fight Club to be far too tongue 'n cheek and juvenile for my liking). Special props go out to Robert Downey Jr., who's burn out witty alcoholic character is played with such deadpan accuracy that one cannot help but to feel that Robert was there himself at one time, heh. Other than that, people who are expecting something overly grisly and violent in nature should stick to the usual horror schlock that seems to be coming out these days.... This is a film that makes you think. The violence is portrayed with a sense of real life accuracy, and I appreciate that quite a bit since it puts things into perspective rather than over-exaggerating the truth and exploiting a real life tragedy like so many of these type of films tend to do.... One thing that I didn't like, though, was the usage of pop music during the killing scenes (ala Martin Scorsese). I would have much preferred something devilish or creepy playing instead. Oh well..... Another problem was the uber lame family life scenes that should have been cut out of the film in order to bring the film's lengthy time down (Zodiac is actually quite a long movie). It seemed ultra cliche to see the main character arguing with his overly needy wife about his obsession with the Zodiac case. Robert Graysmith didn't divulge into the intimate details of his personal life in the book, so why indulge the audience here....?    Other than that, thisis probably the best movie that I have seen so far this year.

That is why i ordered Genie in your Genes along with other books right after reading this smart piece of work. It seems to me that its a story or a strange movie in progress (the movie of human drama) and as if before a certain time we will play like blind (ignorant) characters and with the seeming progression of the time concept we will become more and more awake and take the rod of blindness out from our behinds!

B000QUCNOK|4.0|The long slo-mos and wide shots are not always necessary.  But it is a fascinating, disturbing and certainly original story.  You can practically detect the scents as the murderer learns the art of perfume-making from a master, and as the former breathes in the fragrance of the young women he ends up killing in a desire to capture their unique scents forever.        I don't think I would have cast Hoffman in the role of Baldini--his accent was too slippery and he didn't look quite right in the role.  But the others fared far better.  I am now curious to read the novel.

The rest of the cd, frankly, BLOWS! Really just not good and not my thing at all. Well, at least I can crank the mighty \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" whenever I want now!
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I liked the movie.<br />I appreciate the rather uniform high quality of the amazon reviews, it tells me that the movie stimulates people to think about the issues and consider what the authors present.<br />But i'm left with several lingering problems about what was going on.<br />Perhaps these things were settled in the novel and only hinted at in the movie, i don't know.<br /><br />Like any good piece of literature there are several threads interwoven.<br />The first is about obsession and talent. Here the movie reminds of Amadeus, just a different sense-this with smell and Amadeus with sound.<br />For Amadeus was about talent, like this movie what happens when talent is submerged in life and suppressed and not recognized for the rarity and genius that it is.<br />The main character, Frog (apparently one translation of his name and a striking description of the character and his walk as well), never has a chance. Despite being an olafactory genius, he is trapped in a time and place that only offers his talent meager usage. That is one of the questions i had, this main theme just gets dropped after the climax of the naked bodies in the square, he literally loses the obsession and the drive, i don't know why.<br /><br />As his uniquely talented nose is discovering the world and trying to find an outlet (which it eventually does with Dustin Hoffman's character, the failed Italian perfumer). The second theme begins to emerge, on top of the obsession is something about the essential things, the essence of being, the smell that characterizes. At first it looks like the author is talking about the soul, the thing that makes a woman a woman, a piece of steel-steel etc. but i am not sure. It looks as if this characteristic, this smell that he detects is the essence of being a woman, maybe love, maybe joy in living, maybe even pheromones of attraction and sensual passion. This is the whole thread about creating the perfect perfume from the distilled essence of the 12 (or is it 13?) beautiful, attractive, young women. It doesn't appear to be about sex, despite the orgy at the end where the townsfolk get a whiff of the finished product. Perhaps there is a hint in the three kinds of scents used in perfumes, one for immediate, one for intermediate, one for long term. In the long term, the townspeople were apparently embarrassed and ashamed, in the short term they were passionate and lustful. In any case, the perfume is about synergy, how the essence of these women together create the perfect perfume.<br /><br />Another major theme is about love and caring. The first half basically hasn't any love in it at all, the later half has the relationship of the father and daughter and them to the dead but not forgotten mother and wife. The Frog has no love or concern for anyone, his first murder is just circumstantial, an accident.The others are planned, calculating and cold blooded, none even with any passion or lust despite the hair shorn and naked bodies of the young victims. His only passion comes in a brief, what if vision he sees when he opens and uses the perfume in the town square. It's not as much regret for their deaths as a missed opportunity to smell them more intimately. But another thing that puzzles me is that the universe, that fate seems to follow him and tidy things up, everyone that passes him along, from birth mother, to orphanage exploiter, to perfumer, to 2nd perfumer, died comically tragic deaths soon after he moves on. It is as if the universe is balancing out the very rotten hand he was dealt, by dealing death to those that exploit him. But why? Because they didn't recognize and further the talented nose? No, it is more like cleaning house or tying up lose ends. Again, i'm not sure what the author is trying to tell us here.<br /><br />Even with these 3 themes doing a complex waltz on screen, the movie is a riot of color and proposed smells for us, the audience. Since our theaters don't have aerosols that bring specific smells to our minds, the smells are provoked by some extraordinarily good movie making. I for one can smell the sewers of later 16 or early 16thC Paris, i've been in Chinese fish markets and suspect that they smelled pretty much how the world into which he was thrust so unceremoniously did back then. This crossover of visual and olfactory senses is a treat, movies seldom work much on our sense of smell. Again the alignment with Amadeus pops up, just another sense. There is this nice crossover between sense and sensually, for smell is a key sense in sex and lust, something that the movie uses to heighten and strength the impact.<br /><br />It's an interesting movie, i'm glad i ran across it.aordinarily good movie making.

As her first novel, her writing style is still rough and lacks some of the refinment of her later works, but she still brings her sharp eye for satire and examination of societal/marriage topics.  Catherine Morland pales in comparison to later strong heronies like Elizabeth Bennet or Fanny Price, but she's delightful to read and chuckle about her naive outlook on life.

0753820250|5.0|I took a good two to three weeks to savor this well written story.  I agree with the five star reviewers that its everything you'd want in a novel and more.  I found myself at one moment tensing from the suspense and at another moment cringing from the pain of first love jealousy.  If you enjoy reading a story that peels away layers like an onion to reveal exactly what caused such a stench, then you'll find this book delicious.  Just remember to chew the pieces slowly as opposed to swallowing them whole.  It goes down much better and leaves you with a great aftertaste. A surprise dish, trust me!
B000002A3T|5.0|I will admit I only listened to Pink Floyd rather late in life(I saw the lunar lander live on TV)past the heyday of the so called height of the band. I enjoy listening to the album, and with the right headphones on there is so much more to listen to beyond the music itself. A music afficiando? not I, but I know what I like, and this album(CD) rates quite a bit higher than 'Dark Side of the Moon' in my collection. Even though I bought 'The Division Bell' first I was disappointed in my purchase of \\"Dark Side of the Moon'
B00005JPLW|5.0|Reminds me of when I first saw the Matrix and thought this movie would be a fan favorite for years to come. Certainly the best action film I have seen so far in 2007, and that's including the summer blockbusters..    One critique if there is one. I wonder why Miller did not follow the full legend and story. I would think the Oracle's original prophecy that a Spartan prince must die or Sparta will burn, would have added to the dramaticism of this movie. According to the legend Leonidas went to the battle of Thermopylae with the intention of fighting to the death from the very beginning. Also, according to history, the third day of battle even when the Spartans were surrounded, lasted for hours! I would have liked to have seen a bigger final battle scene, but alas, this version works just as well.
0920668372|5.0|...not children. I found this book among the effects of my mother, who passed away from cancer last week. I had not been able to visit her for some time before she died, and the cancer had been very quick. But I missed her. Till going through her stuff the weight of how much had never really hit me. But just one page of this book said everything, and I recommend it to all mothers and anyone who has one. On every page were her thoughts put in words by another, it was obvious. This is what she was thinking about. And it gives me a lot, not all of it pleasant but not all unpleasant either, to consider now myself. I can't read it without crying. This book is about how much mothers love and miss their children.<br /><br />You should check this too: [[ASIN:B000003SD6 The Birth Caul (A Shamanism of Childhood)]]
B00005JPLW|1.0|I saw the movie in theaters and would rate it at 5 stars however the 1 star I gave it is because I just watched the regular dvd (not Blueray or HD) and from the very beginning I couldn't get past how bad the movie looked.  I mean its absolutely horrible, its grainy, fuzzy, might as well be a snowstorm on my television if it was for that fact the movie has color.  Not sure how the high def versions are or if I just happened to have a bad version, which if I do please someone let me know as I need to get a different copy but as it stands don't buy this movie on regular ol DVD as its horrible.
B00000IREA|4.0|If you are expecting a great film, then leave this one alone.  If you want to see Jane Fonda, in her prime, in various states of undress, then you are in luck!   The 'strip tease' at the start of the film is infamous.  If you use your 'pause' and 'stop' buttons on the DVD, you CAN see Jane's breasts a few times.   Every costume Jane wears shows off her great body.  Twice, her costume is torn up, and we see even more skin!   My favorite scene is \\"The Excessive Machine\\".  Jane is put in this 'organ' and stripped of her costume.  The machine is meant to pleasure you to death.  Jane Fonda is great here.  She sells this scene for all it's worth.  Soon, she is covered in sweat, and we get many close-ups of her face, as she gives in to the pleasure.  Jane then gives what may be the best orgasm ever in a PG film.    Again, the plot, and special effects are not that good.  But Jane Fonda's body ROCKS!
B000002G87|5.0|Just about every serious rock music fan knows the story of Eric Clapton falling head-over-heels-in-love with his friend George Harrison's wife and creating a testimonial plea to her in the form of the blues-rock double album, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs.<br /><br />Eric had taken the name, Layla, from a character in the poem, Leyla And Mejnun, written by the Persian poet Nizami. In the poem, Mejnun goes insane over the fact that Leyla's parents would not allow her to see him.<br /><br />That poem is where the fiction ends on this album. The passion, pain and intense longing in these songs is very real. Clapton's singing voice is pure emotion as he cries out in passionate longing. Keyboardist Bobby Whitlock's backing vocals complement Eric perfectly.<br /><br />Guitar great (and according to Whitlock, Eric's kindred spirit) Duane Allman came in to play on one or two songs, but fortunately (for us) ended up playing on the rest of the album, making this the blues-rock guitar masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />From the emotional pleading of Bell Bottom Blues and the frantic sorrow of Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad to the pure, unadulterated blues of Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out and Have You Ever Loved A Woman, the two guitarist spur each other on to heights of guitar magnificence that still stands among both legendary axemen's greatest work.<br /><br />Guitar greatness is everywhere on this album. From Allman's slide guitar magic on Anyday to Clapton's blistering lead on Key To The Highway. They do a great rocking version of the Hendrix song, Little Wing, as a tribute to Jimi, and then go unplugged and acoustic on I Am Yours.<br /><br />Layla is a masterpiece in itself, and one of the greatest songs in the history of rock music. From Clapton's impassioned vocals and Allman's fiery slide guitar solo to the sad beauty of Duane and Eric's twin slide guitars during the piano coda at the end of the song, Layla reaches heights of passion unparalleled in modern music.<br /><br />Without question, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs is a masterpiece. It's a sonic Van Gogh, a landmark in rock music and a monument to the saddest of all love, unrequited love.And Other Assorted Love Songs is a masterpiece.

B000000QFV|5.0|i have been a loyal sabbath fan, in all their many incarnations, and i have to say that i love this cd.  norse mythology is one of my favorite studies, and when i heard the 'horns' blowing on the battle of tyr- my blood did boil hot in my veins. the musical visualizations that enter your mind when listening to this cd are simply breathtaking.  this cd stays true to the original sabbath themes. i love how you can just sit back relax and be almost transported back to the viking age, the age of battles with broadswords, strong gods, and ancient mysticism.  i highly recommend this cd .

Once is father is cured he is killed in an accident. Johnny becomes a famous stunt cyclist.  When the devil returns to collect.  He becomes the ghost rider and is charged with taking down some devils who have escaped from hell.    It is not great art, but it is a fun movie and should be judged as such.

0446364495|4.0|If Waller had came up with this story on his own, I would have given this book 5 stars. However, this is a true life story. He merely made it into novel form, which, in agreement with the many other criticisms here, he didn't do too well. The characters are flat and there are too many cliches.    However, although the telling of it is inferior, the story itself is remarkably compelling and moving. I've never had the motivation to go and write a review before, and here I am right after finishing this book. To know that two people can share such intense, sincere love, and to find out and experience how they did - that is the reason why you should read this book.     I am (and I think we all should be) very glad that Michael and Carolyn have put this story out there for the world to read and feel.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV, with it's rock opus Stairway To Heaven, secured the band's status as rock gods when it was released in 1971, and still remains the third best-selling album of all time (behind The Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-75 and Michael Jackson's Thriller). The songs are all staples on today's classic-rock radio, and they're all still very much a part of people's lives. Just yesterday, I saw someone wearing a t-shirt with the ZOSO album cover image on the front of it.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin IV offers a variety of heavy-metal, blues, acoustic music, and rock n' roll. It opens with the enthusiastic and lusty Black Dog. With Robert Plant scream-singing sensuous lyrics and Jimmy Page playing a wicked-fast guitar riff, the song is a classic.<br /><br />Rock And Roll is another classic. With lyrics reminicent of 1950s era rock n' roll, and a heavier, electric, and updated version of that genre, the song definitely lives up to it's title.<br /><br />The Battle Of Evermore is a mandolin dominated medievil fantasy that has an otherworldly aura, and features British folk singer Sandy Denny sharing the lead vocal with Robert Plant.<br /><br />The legendary Stairway To Heaven, of course, is one of the greatest songs in the history of rock music, and it carries significant weight on this album. Beginning with only an acoustic guitar and flute, it deliberately and skillfully builds through several melodies and tempo changes untill it reaches the heights of screaming heavy-metal brilliance. The mood of the song is reflective and hopeful, and it strikes a chord in people's hearts and thoughts every time they hear it. It was was destined to become the legend that it is and will always be.<br /><br />Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks  both include inventive guitar, interesting lyrics, and they rock with unrelenting beats. The acoustic and mellow Going To California adds variety and a change of pace.<br /><br />The album closes with another classic, When The Levee Breaks, a heavy-metal-meets-the-blues celebration of intense expression. John Bonham's powerful and, as always, excellant drums are highlighted on this one, and the song closes this classic album perfectly.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin IV is most definitely a classic rock legend. The past, the present, and the future. It has been, it is, and it will be, an indelible part of our lives and rock music history. And year after year after year, Stairway To Heaven will be named the The-Number-One-Song-Of -All-Time on classic-rock radio stations all over the world...<br /><br />Again.expression.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|\\"They\\" can say that Marky can't act, but \\"they\\" are wrong.  His skills have improved greatly over the years and I think any poor presentation on his part was due to poor script/storyline.  This one kept us on the edge of our seats...Rambo and Bourne Identity all wrapped up in one.  The only thing I thought the film could do without was perhaps the cliche scene of our lovely \\"love interest\\" holding a shotgun while wearing her finest Victoria Secret apparel.  It just seemed to predictable that we would witness her in her skivies holding a weapon...sometimes these movies really are all the same.  But, all in all, an exciting ride that you won't want to miss.
0393061434|4.0|Its a book with which you can relate to very easily if you're an engineer. At the end it gets boring when he starts talking about how Apple became big but its the part on how he starts off and how difficult it was for him to get to making computers that makes for a very interesting read. Certainly a book I would recommend every engineer to read!
0767827902|4.0|Being a Ben Johnson fan, I wasn't disappointed. I was surprised Larry Mc Murtry actually wrote something worth while. It is an interesting story most people growing up in the '50s can relate to, even if not raised in a small town. Good acting by big names getting a start on their careers. Worth watching.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and have watched it again on DVD.  Based on one of the gripping books by Stephen Hunter, it is an action-packed movie that is very up to the minute.
B00002SWEM|5.0|The music has been beautiful, but this DVD gives you the ability to see the people and faces behind the music. We enjoyed it very much.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|For those who bemoan the lack of additional songs, specifically 'The Bed's Too Big Without You', I would recommend seeking out the Australian or British edition of this compilation; it has all 28 songs from the American release and includes 'Bed's Too Big' and 'Rehumanise Yourself'. These two songs rectify the shortfall of songs from 'Regatta De Blanc' and Ghost In The Machine' (only four each on the American version) and makes it feel a significantly more comprehensive compilation.     Yes, there are still tracks missing that would make it truly perfect, but remember that the Police only released five studio albums; if A&M had added yet more tracks to this compilation it would have come close to negating the need to buy the original releases and they were never going to allow that to happen were they? So the thirty-song version is about as good as we could ask for, it's an excellent blast through the past. Enjoy!
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a story of tragedy and triumph told through the eyes of two Afghani women.

B000RJO58M|5.0|I loved Shaun of the Dead, so I knew that I would enjoy this movie a little. I was wrong...I enjoyed this movie a lot.<br /><br />The story is great...a do-good London cop gets exiled to a small town in the country.  His impeccable work record is making his coworkers at the London Metro Police look bad.  His small town coworkers think he's the big fish in the small pond just looking for high crime and murder around every corner...but they say every thing is just an accident, or is it really?  The greater good...it's all for the greater good...<br /><br />Sure there are some predictable jokes involved, but I think they are pulled off with right twist by the actors who know they are predictable. Timothy Dalton does a fabulous job as a twisted Supermarket Manager/Owner. I love his line commenting about the performance of a local community theatre blonde bombshell \\"I could just bash in your head to let out all your secrets.\\" There are some great cameo appearances by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Paul Freeman. The editing is fantastic with quick jerking cuts of doors opening to show transition from one scene to the next, which is seen in Shaun of the Dead. The dialogue is also fantastic...there are many references to other films including Shaun of the Dead. You will have to watch it over and over to catch all the references...<br /><br />If you loved Shaun of the Dead and like comedies with a good story line, then this movie is right up your alley...
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Live performances are almost always the best and this Dido DVD is no exception. It is so easy to identify with the lyrics in her songs.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|A movie like 300 is a must for High Definition players...either Blu-Ray or HD-DVD.  The movie is stylistically wonderful.  Every frame has details that need to be seen in every pixel.  The slow motion speed changes in some of the action sequences make the battle scenes stand out like a perfectly executed ballet.  The story is not a new one...it has been the subject of many a movie, book, game or whatever medium...the last stand.  Fight to the death for sake of your beliefs, honor and love no matter what the consequences.  In a world of many copies and remakes, this version of the story stands out for the vision of the director, Zack Snyder, to pay tribute to Frank Miller's graphic novel version.  Bravo Mr. Snyder.

B000058B2W|5.0|One of the most underrated rock bands of the 70's strikes again, and by this point in their career, they showed NO signs of slowing down (unfortunately they DID start going downhill after this album in terms of songwriting quality).      Procol Harum really feels like they are maturing on Exotic Birds and Fruit.  The music is solid and consistently pleasing, though the lyrics seem more important this time around compared to previous releases.    \\"As Strong as Samson\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  The vocal melody build up, the quiet eerieness of the atmosphere that reminds me of growing up and maturing (and having kids- yuck!) and the all-around pleasant tone.  It's a really well-written song.  I can't put it any other way.  Truly one of the bands best ever tracks.    \\"Beyond the Pale\\" reminds me of drunken pirates swinging back and forth, and dancing on a ship.  haha.  I'm sure that's just an image for me personally.  The band probably didn't intend the song to sound that way.  \\"Butterfly Boys\\" is a good rocking tune.  Procol Harum doesn't want to abandoned their old ways of contributing at least one rocker on each album, and I applaud them for that.  \\"New Lamps for Old\\" scares me.  It reminds me of growing old (unlike \\"Strong as Samson\\" which reminds me of growing up and trying to let go of the past).  I don't like feeling old.  It's cold, lonely, and scary.  However, the melody is really nice (and haunting come to think of it).      Yes, it's a great album.  Buy it now.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|I give this album 4 stars for these excellent songs: Insomnia, Prince of Darkness, Time: The End. One of Megadeth's best songs, Wanderlust, is easily worth the price of the album.<br /><br />The rest of the songs? Not so great. But, that's why we have playlists...
B00006JKOL|5.0|The great thing about classic Jethro Tull is that, whether you're listening to an album from the late 60's or late 70's, it's going to be good.  Why?  Because most Jethro Tull albums are written more or less the same way.  If you like one, you're most likely going to like ALL of them.      By the mid 70's, Jethro Tull had pretty much established themselves as a pretty unique band with their own sound and style.  Once again, nobody can figure out if they are a straight-up rock band, or one of the progressive rock giants.    Minstrel in the Gallery is closer to Aqualung than all the other albums, in my opinion.  That's because the songs on this album are, for the most part, pretty long, but not EXTREMELY long.   Long enough to tell an interesting story and build some interesting musical ideas.  The flute playing is solid like always, and the guitar work rocks harder than usual.  This is just another really solid album.      Occasionally you might hear the title track on classic rock radio, but I can assure you that the rest of the album maintains the same level of quality.  Jethro Tull were really good at making one great album after another for over a decade.

B000LE0TGA|5.0|OUT OF THE BLUE turned out to be the Electric Light Orchestra's biggest-selling album of their legacy. This 30-year-old album spawned two Top 20 hits,TURN TO STONE and SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN,also fan favorites like IT'S OVER,MR. BLUE SKY and WILD WEST HERO. All tracks contained herein were written by frontman Jeff Lynne. I love the sound of the drums,although it was not Jim Keltner playing. Lynne and Keltner would later collaborate together for recordings by Lynne's close friends the late George Harrison and Tom Petty(Lynne,Harrison,Petty,Bob Dylan and the late Roy Orbison later founded the all-star Traveling Wilburys). Keltner would also drum on Lynne's solo recordings as well,particularly Lynne's 1990 album ARMCHAIR THEATRE.
0316018953|2.0|Meh, I couldn't get into this one.  Perhaps because I'm so utterly sick of hearing about terrorists and whatnot.  I mean, they're not going to go away, and all an unpopular war does is make us MORE of a target.  So reading a book that (allegedly) involves terrorism wasn't my thing.    Still, the ending was very good--though it didn't quite make up for the rest of the book.  Plot was smart and well-delivered... I guess Bosch doesn't interest me that much as a character.  Especially when he started butting heads with the Feds.  I know cops and Feds don't like to cooperate with each other, so I get where Bosch was coming from; but then again, he's being stubborn with a case that could involve the release of radiation by terrorists if the Feds don't track them down--so his pig-headedness seems really petty and dangerous under these circumstances.    An okay book but not one I'd recommend.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Terrific acting and charachter development. Excellent re-writing of the plot and characters to bring it up to date and incorporate plot twists without losing (but enhancing) the main story line.     Including the original movie \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\" in the box set was a real bonus.    One of the best movie purchases I have ever made.
0345455681|5.0|\\"London: The Novel\\" is unique and very special. It is a long and enjoyable book that, like all the best books, allows you to immerse yourself in and toenter another world. Actually, many worlds, each chapter being effectively a stand-alone short story in its own right.  Personally I usually have a problem with short stories because I don't like discovering that they are about to end, when I have just become familiar with the setting and all of the characters.  However, in this case, although the stories end chapter by chapter, there is continuity in terms of family lines. Which makes it rather wonderful - because you can see how a family trait manifests itself in the different ages. For example, is the ruthlessness necessary for survival in medieval England a help or a hindrance in later, more genteel times? This book deserves to occupy a little nook somewhere in your bookshelf!

B000OY6BRS|5.0|For a few extra dollars, I managed not only to get the SB-400, but the sto-fen omnibounce (which actually helps remedy vertical shots) and a charger with batteries.  As for the SB-400, it does everything my SB-600 can do except for swivel left or right, lacks the strength that the SB-600 has, eliminates commander mode on my D80 to initiate any wireless flash capabilities, and recycle time isn't as fast as my SB-600.  The advantage of the SB-400 is it is very COMPACT and is definitely a formidable substitute for any built-in flash on Nikon bodies.  I would use the SB-400 for small get togethers and personal shoots, but if I needed to the extra firepower and wireless flash capabilities, I'd stick with the SB-600.  Great overall package deal, I must say.

B000T433CO|3.0|Though my opinion may not reflect that of the populous, I must say that I was gravely disappointed with Cameron Diaz's performance in this film. It was strikingly absurd.<br /><br />She, of course, looked wonderful, which may have been a big part of the problem. Diaz tends to look as if she is thrilled even when she is supposed to be a woman repressed. I would assume she could not bring herself to believe the character. Perhaps that is the cause of her stumbling portrayal of A--<br /><br />You see? I just finished watching the film and have completely forgotten the name of the lead.<br /><br />The perennially bubbly Diaz, who may have very well fallen in love with the rambling script, was unable to translate the innumerable complications of the character for which she was cast, leaving this humble viewer at a loss. This storyline would have been better served had an unknown been in her place.<br /><br />There were some very moving scenes that bear viewing- about 1/20th of the film's content.<br /><br />I could charge the director, who rightfully should be made to shoulder some of the blame, or the cinematographer, who oafishly ground several scenes into a clumsy mass, but I won't.<br /><br />Jack Black played his pseudo-type well. Kate Winslet was able to deliver the fine points of Iris' conflicted woe. Eli Wallach erased the seams between personality and self and Jude Law fought graciously to maintain professionalism as he played against a cold fish. (If you look closely, you may be able to detect a tinge of frustration.)<br /><br />I know she could do better.<br /><br />But wait... perhaps I could post a big box of blame to the writers, who numbly delivered a working script full of lame attempts at realism. Nearly, nearly... not quite so. It's a feel-good gone bad, or a mediocre dream gone worse.<br /><br />And thusly, 136 minutes of my sad life gone-- not to mention the expense put towards what became a tortuous non-event-- never to be regained.<br /><br />Ok, so the character's name was Amanda. I admit I remember. Nevertheless, if you're thinking of renting or purchasing this film site-unseen, let me dissuade you. Do not walk the dark path I have walked in order to say you've been there.

B00005JPLW|2.0|Here we have Mediterranian type (Greeks), yet Hollywood can't get away from showing most of the actors with --BLUE eyes.  Blue eues? Get real!     Supposedly this film it is to attract primarily an American audience, but the actors have British accents who can't but wait to say Sire versus Sir. What's wrong with the neutral American accent?  Worse.  This film took every opportunity to show needless smutty (nudes) sex.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|On July 4th, 1969 I was lighting firecrackers in Vallejo, California 6 miles away from where the second Zodiac murder took place. It was a difficult time-the Summer of Love along the Haight-Ashbury district had degenerated into a hazy wash of drug dealers peddling to Hippies that were descending into junkies and Vallejo, California the town best known for the Naval Base Mare Island and the city where Raymond Burr was raised had a reputation as a quiet town so our parents were shocked when news of the murder rocked the town. It wasn't the first murder in Vallejo but it was the unusual nature of the murder itself; the killer who called himself the Zodiac mailed ciphers to the San Francisco Chronicle, Examiner and the Vallejo Times-Herald threatening to go on a killer spree unless the newspapers published his ciphers. He then taunted the police and FBI in the Bay Area to try and figure out his identity as he killed more people. My brothers were teenagers at the time and as further news of the Zodiac's body count increased my parents were more nervous about what would happen to my brothers after dark than whether or not they were remembering to use rubbers.<br /><br />David Fincher's new film captures that nervous time extremely well in his new film \\"Zodiac\\". Based on the book by former Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, the film covers those obsessed with catching the killer as well as the killer's deeds themselves. Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) obsesses over the killer, his use of cryptology to communicate. Graysmith becomes involved with the police officer (Mark Ruffalo) and the writer (Robert Downey Jr. who gives a perfect performance) covering the case for the Chronicle. Slowly Grarysmith finds that the Zodiac takes over his life and he becomes more focused with finding the man behind the mask and letters as the police gradually give up on the case. With marvelous supporting performances from Anthony Edwards, Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Fincher injects a film that could have faltered because of the large time span and the fact that the outcome is known (there was a suspect identified but the police didn't have enough evidence until much too late) into a riveting if flawed film.<br /><br />All the signs are here for a solid transfer from Paramount-accurate flesh tones and a crisp looking presentation with solid blacks. The audio is nicely used creating an environment that will creep you out if you listen to it in 5.1 with its use of ambient effects. Shot with HD video camera, the image does look a bit murky during some of the darker scenes but overall looks quite good.<br /><br />This edition is bare bones and comes only with previews/trailers for other films. One of the trailers though does advertise for a two disc deluxe set that will have extensive extras on the film and the case. I'd suggest waiting for that deluxe edition and renting this edition.<br /><br />A terrific film from director David Fincher receives a nice looking presentation that has a major flaw-no extras or commentary tracks. There will be a deluxe edition later in early 2008. I'd suggest waiting for that edition and renting this in the meantime.ave faltered because of the large time span and the fact that the outcome is known (there was a suspect identified but the police didn't have enough evidence until much too late) into a riveting if flawed film.

B000MXPE74|5.0|As usual, I bought this CD for ONE SONG, but it turns out the entire album is great fun to listen to.  It's great to play at work; it really increases the energy in the IV room.  The lyrics are strange & full of Scottish slang, but that's ok.  Now that I own it, I notice the band's songs being used in commercials & movie trailers.  BUY IT.

B00005JMK0|5.0|This is a movie that I watched 4 time over at the movie theatre. Although I own the VCD version that was released in Singapore, I still wish to own a DVD version.... better still a remastered version. The movie features a number of catchy tunes which keeps you waiting for more. I would say it's a classic love story with a twist. I hope they re-produce this classic.
141694740X|5.0|As a single woman who has been burned more times that she can count, I for one am happy that this book came out.  I saw a little bit about it on Oprah, but didn't pay too much attention to it.  After getting burned again, I decided to go to my nearest Barnes and Noble and buy this book.  It is very simple to read, and that makes it even better.  Greg gives plain out explanations as to \\"the signs\\" that he's not that into you.  I must say...after reading this book, I took what the book said to heart.  I had a guy friend (who I'm no longer in contact with, thank goodness) that I always had to call.  He didn't have time to call because he was busy, yet he fed so much \\"...But I do like you\\" crap to me over the phone.  And whenever he did call, it was always after midnight.  If I hadn't read this book, I would have been sucked in.  Instead, I just stopped calling him altogether.  Since he hasn't called since, I count it as good riddings.  Life is too short to play games, and with this book, you can finally wake up and say \\"game over\\".
B000002O1Q|5.0|In a day and age of ITunes you would think that you could find the sound track to this cult classic. Thank goodness that I did find it on Amazon.com now when I'm walking my dogs I can rock out to Sorerer or Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young. Great digital sound.
0143038419|5.0|This book is making its way through the female world network like wildfire, and with good reason: every woman can related to at least a part of it. As I was reading, I kept thinking that the author was writing the story of my experiences rather than her own. I laughed and cried hysterically from beginning to end, which, to me, means it was a great book! Send a copy to every woman you know who is experiencing any sort of crisis whatsoever.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series in it's full version is the finest depiction of military life in wartime that I have yet seen. Unfortunately the present release has omitted an episode from the original series in order to add spam. The gory detail included actually makes it an anti-war film as well. The sensitivity of the characters portrayed is superb.
B00005JPLW|1.0|Most reviewers here are rating movie content.  I gave 1 star because this is the worst quality DVD I've ever seen.  I couldn't get past 2 minutes because of the grain and fuzziness.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|Underworld (Len Wiseman, 2003)<br /><br />Okay, so, well, it's Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather with big guns. And that's a reason to watch just about anything. The question is, is there anything else about this movie worth watching? I'm not entirely sure whether I can give a definitive answer to that question, but I'm leaning towards \\"no\\".<br /><br />The plot-- what there is of it-- revolves around Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire from a clan who've been at war with a clan of werewolves (known as the Lyken, because in Hollywood, everything is cooler if you shorten it), heade dby the enigmatic Lucian (Michael Sheen) for a long, long time. And, well, I'd have to go well into the second half of the movie to give you more of a plot summary than that, because it takes this movie forever to actually come up with a plot. (When it does arrive, it's a rather loose definition of the term anyway.) The main thing you need to know is that a human medical student, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), gets in the way.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm giving the movie short shrift, and when it was originally conceived, there was a much stronger, more coherent storyline. Still, that's not what we ended up getting. Yeah, things finally start coming together about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie, but for the first hour and twenty minutes, there's really not much to do but stare at Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather with big guns. And, you know, even that can get old. (Substitute \\"Charlize Theron\\" and AEon Flux, and there you go.) Definitely not one I'll be rewatching. **
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Wonderful !  The young cast and the beautiful grand scope of this movie makes a breathtaking hour and half of enjoyment for the lovers of this story and the fans who have watched it on stage.     I thought the voices of The Phantom, Gerard Butler, Christine, Emma Rossem, and Raoul, Patrick Wilson were right on for the roles they had. I thought the dark raspiness of the Phantom in certain places put such an emphasis on the mind set of the character.  I think it was well done and very enjoyable.  ALW.,and Joel Schumacher can be assured that this version will be a classic for years to come.
B00008J2PG|4.0|Gregory Peck stars as an Irish Priest who works for the Vatican. During Hitler's occupation of Italy he helps free thousands of civilians and soldiers from Nazi clutches. During this time, he is at loggerheads with the evil Nazi commander who is determined to catch him and punish him.<br /><br />I found this to be an entertaining inspirational film. At times I found Peck's character a trifle overbearing, (so I wouldn't have minded seeing him taken down a peg or two). Overall, though this was a vastly entertaining film describing the life of a great man.<br /><br />4 stars.

Take charge of your ailment, claim it, it's yours, you are smart and can make decisions better than anybody. Love, pray and work hard because you are blessed.   Hope is what patients need to fight for recovery, especially with neurological issues. This book provides with knowledge and proof about the plasticity of the brain. The healing takes time but the brain remaps itself to give you great return. There is no quick-fix when it comes to a neurological ailment.
0060989157|5.0|I decided to read \\"The Dirt\\" to prepare for Nikki Sixx's upcoming book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" and now I wonder, why did I wait so long?  A great book for Crue fans or anyone interested in taking a peak into the 80's rock & roll lifestyle.  \\"The Dirt\\" sheds light not only onto the bizarre and over the top antics, substance abuse problems, and sexual ecscapades of these 4 musicians, but provides insight into the emotional scars carried from their childhoods, as well as those that they developed on their rise to the top of the charts and their subsequent tumble to the bottom.  I couldn't help but feel a little dirty reading this book, but I didn't want to put it down--it's really a great read!  There were many moments where I thought, \\"These guys are scumbags\\", yet there are endearing moments that seem to balance it out.  Although I was certainly suprised by the tales of excess, I was more shocked by the shear number of \\"friends\\" and strangers who were more than willing to share in the action--be it drugs, alcohol or sex.  Kinda scary...
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|It's really simple...if you are videophile.....get this movie !!!

For those that said it's 'overpriced' apparently mom didn't tell you how to shop...I had a 30% off coupon and picked it up at borders for 29 bucks....this movie will be the benchmark and I highly advise to get this movie ASAP
B000F3T7RE|5.0|Dmitri Shostakovich wrote a series of fifteen string quartets that span his entire career. These are alternately searing, violent, brooding, fiery, introspective works that run the gamut of human emotion and experience -- hardly beautiful, and often quite depressing. But man, do they pack a wallop! They're often considered the greatest creations in the string quartet genre since Beethoven, and it's easy to see why.<br /><br />These were recorded in live performance in three separate years ('94, '98, and '99) at the summer Aspen Music Festival in Colorado. The playing is not only passionate and precise, but imbued with a palpable intensity. There's no audible hint of an audience, but applause is included judiciously at the conclusion of several of the works. The recording is close-up and very vivid, though not quite in-your-face; there's adequate space around the instruments to make listening comfortable. Any closer and you'd be hurled against the back wall!<br /><br />This re-issued box set retails at less than half that of the original release. Even though I already have the quartets on separate older discs by various other groups, the Emersons give them that slap of American modernism quite apart from the Slavic flavor of a native Russian group like the Borodin Quartet. Yes, if one is familiar with these works, one can actually hear and feel the difference. I've read some reviewers here, as well as professional critics, write of the Emersons' lack of a &#34;Russian soul&#34;; I have no idea what that means.  I suppose if one has to ask....

B00000IQW3|5.0|I ORIGINALLY COPIED THIS FILM OFF OF HBO ON MY VCR ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO.  WE SAW IT AT THE THEATER TWO TIMES WHEN IT FIRST WAS RELEASED.

B0000640VO|5.0|I watched `Amelie' solely because some friends went on a ten minute rant on just how wonderfully splendid a movie it is.  I have to say that after watching it through it truly is splendid.  This is due in large part to Audrey Tautou's delightful performance as Amelie.  She's so infectiously sweet and charming it's a shame she never got the coveted Oscar nomination that said year, but in the Academies defense it was a very tough year.  Truly though, the film as a whole soaks up her sweet disposition and delivers a wholesomely delicious cinematic experience that is hard to find amidst modern cinema.  `Amelie' proves to be one of the more well-rounded delightful films I've seen in a long time, one of those very rare films that puts a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your stomach.<br /><br />The film, coupled with a tremendous script, follows young Amelie as she endeavors to make right the lives of everyone around her.  Amelie grew up in a not so happy home with a not so happy father and mother and thus in her adulthood she distances herself from reality and instead of making friends and companions she busies herself with making everyone she knows and or comes encounter with happy, trying in a very humble and secretive way to make their dreams come true, whether it be setting them up with the man (or woman) of their dreams or helping them get back at the person who makes their life a living Hades.  Her biggest accomplishment though comes in the form of herself, for in helping a certain someone reunite with a memory of times past she realizes that she herself needs some helping out and thus makes her own life better for it.  I'm being completely and utterly honest when I say that no movie I've seen in recent years is as sweet and charming as `Amelie'.<br /><br />My favorite part of this film would have to be Amelie's decision to send her father's favorite garden-gnome on a trip around the world.  This is of course in an attempt to persuade her father to travel before he dies, but it's this simple gesture to me that somewhat sums up the whole feel of this film.  It's so light and sweet and now every time I see the `Travelocity' commercials I'm reminded of this uplifting film.<br /><br />Everything about `Amelie' works to its advantage and this in effect works very well for the audience.  Amelie moves through her life in a fairytale way, meeting new people and diverging on new quests on a whim and this adds so much to the saccharine feel of the film, giving the audience that fuzzy feeling of joy wrapped in blissful happiness.  The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does a wonderful job in creating the perfect atmosphere for his dreamlike tale.  As `Amelie' rolls on the audience is connected with Tautou's character in such a strong way because we begin to understand what has formed the angelic creature before us.  She's sheltered and shy yet overtly charming and endearing.  The ending may be predictable but it's the type of predictable that makes us glad we came to the movies.  Who wouldn't want everything to turn out wonderful for this selfless human being?<br /><br />So, the verdict from me at least is watch this film and enjoy from start to finish what may very well be the most upbeat and uplifting charm of a film ever made.  I know that may seem like a lot of undue praise, but is it really undue?  If you watch `Amelie' expecting the good time you deserve you'll be richly rewarded with feelings that modern cinema all too often forgets to award us.  Watching the beautifully captivating Tautou prance from scene to scene in all her impishly angelic glory is enough to melt to hard of even the iciest of people.t it's this simple gesture to me that somewhat sums up the whole feel of this film.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I had never seen `The Little Mermaid' growing up, but after finding out my soon-to-be child is indeed a girl my wife insisted her first cartoon be `The Little Mermaid' and so I can now say that I saw and I understand why every little girl needs this movie.  I personally don't feel it should be her first cartoon, and I'll state my reasons for feeling that way in a minute, but I do feel she'll love this cartoon as she gets older and I'm sure I'll be seeing quite a bit of it.  It is truly magical, from the animation to the storyline to the infectious musical numbers that even I as a kid knew word for word, and I hadn't ever seen the film.  You can't help but smile when watching Sebastian the crab sing `Kiss the Girl' or the upbeat `Under the Sea'.  Maybe the only cartoon that comes close to the magic of Disney to me anyways would be `Beauty and the Beast'.<br /><br />The story of young Ariel is one of love, but surprisingly it's neither the love you'd expect nor the love they try and push to the forefront of the picture.  The reason I love this cartoon is that it really establishes the love between a father and her daughter, which in my case is going to be very appropriate.  Here we have the overly protective father who loves his daughter more than life itself but doesn't really know how to show it.  Then you have the said daughter who rebels because she feels her father is holding her back.  In a sense her father is holding her back, but not because he wants her to miss out but purely because he wants her to stay with him always.  This is jeopardized by the evil sea witch Ursula (the main reason I won't want my daughter to watch this right away) who wants control of the sea.  She uses Ariel, offering her a bargain she can't refuse and thus starts her journey into the arms of the man she loves, Prince Eric.<br /><br />Ursula offers Ariel the opportunity to walk as the humans do in order for her to meet her Prince, but she must give in exchange her magnificent voice.  She only has a few days to win the kiss of love from Prince Eric or she'll become a slave.  So, with the help of her beloved Flounder and her bodyguard of sorts Sebastian she sets off to capture Eric's heart.  The cartoon is classic Disney at its finest, magical and moving, but due to a few mature areas I don't know if it's best suited for extremely young children.  The ending is quite traumatic and extremely unsettling to little kids.  I found it a bit rough myself and I'm far from a child.  Ursula is a very evil bad guy and a very dark and scary one at that.  Every child is different but if your child is prone to nightmares this may not be one to watch right off the bat.  Once she can differentiate from fiction and reality then this cartoon will become one she'll watch again and again, for there is a fairytale ending, but you have to get to it.w days to win the kiss of love from Prince Eric or she'll become a slave.

B00005JPLW|2.0|\\"You bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my city steps. You insult my queen. You threaten my people with slavery and death! Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. Perhaps you should have done the same!\\"  Funny comment coming from one of the most contradictory kings in history, I suppose, before kicking the messenger into a well and splicing the heads of Persians in his own court.  For someone so for peace and against tyranny, King Leonidas sure does have a thing for bending his own philosophy.  The Spartans live to die, live for the ultimate climax of being killed in battle, and the glory, so why really fight FOR peace.  The queen says that only Spartan women give birth to real men, and I guess that's why their own unsatisfactory children are thrown off mountains or killed in the wild.  Makes sense, huh?  Dilios calls the elders greedy and corrupt swine, but in such a violent society bent on destruction anyway, why not just be rid of them?  Why should the king consult them in the first place?  Their advice heeds him against fighting the mighty Persian army, and I guess it bounces off those steel abs of his.  With being so concerned for the survival of his people, and helplessly outnumbered, it's a wonder that Leonidas does not realize that they'll die anyway.  But it's all for honor and being righteous.  Whatever.  We've already it heard over and over and over again elsewhere.  We don't root for the Spartans, we just watch them kill and be killed.  I don't mind it being inaccurate history, I could care less, and I don't care about the violent content, or the message it sends.  I just hate that it's a bad movie.  The special effects are cool, the action is ok, and opinion can either be based on being intelligent or no-nonsense.  I like ridiculous action like the next person, and I don't mind the absence of plot, but I've seen this movie so many times before, and even worse, I've seen it done better.  Action and chaos between men fighting for freedom and a ruler?  Gladiator (not to mention being Best Picture).  You could say Ridley Scott repeated himself with Kingdom of Heaven, but the passion, artistry, and dialog in that movie made it wholly original.  Want crazy creatures and special effects set on never ending battlefields?  See any of the Lord of the Rings films instead.  The script is God awful with macho spiel like \\"Give them nothing! But take from them everything!\\"  You can hear a lot of it spewed in Gerard Butler's Scottish accent (in Sparta?) on the equally manly TV ads.  If you haven't seen anything of Frank Miller's on screen, skip this and see Sin City, directed partly by Miller himself.  Again, there is nothing new to see here.  Aside from anyone with teen in their age, no one will see anything in all the blood and heaving breasts but an empty shell of a film with few thrills for the intelligent action film goer. \\"To victory!\\" says Dilios.  Not likely.
B000QXDED6|3.0|This movie is very odd. The movie is filled with halfnaked people running with spears and disfigured people who try to kill eachother. What's with all the monsters? When I saw the movie I was thinking it would be somewhat realistic then I see Xerxes with his genderconfused prowse.     The movie is supposed to be based on the battle between the massive Persian Army and the 300 spartans, which is odd considering how many the Spartans kill. The fighting in this movie is entertaining so I think 300 is a movie you could rent at least, and the conflict between King Leonidas [king of spartans] and Xerxes ['godking' of the Persians who likes to say he's kind] is very interesting. This movie is mediocre at best and it's corny one liners and action will entertain you, so it's worth a try. Oh and why were there ninjas in it?

I feel uplifted and determined by the lessons it provided, and if anything in it was offensive (i.e. the impression that we're instructed to shun overweight individuals), FORGIVE the writers and move on. I not only intend to consciously use the law of attraction from now on, I have already seen immediate results with little or no effort (except to start using my energy in a positive way), so I find it all the more believable and worthy of the hype it has received.    This book is only for open, forgiving minds, not recommended if you're just in the mood to disprove or find fault with something. Use your judgement and gather from it only what benefits you the most on a personal level, and you should find it a satisfying read.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I enjoy the music daily. And I have never been disappointed in the quality of the product or the service in having it delivered to my home.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I have all the available DVDs from the series and well worth the purchase for me as I love a good mystery and Tom Selleck as well.  He is just so easy on the eyes! I don't believe they could have picked a better actor to play this part--Selleck is a great fit.
1881273989|2.0|I liked this book a lot, but it's yet another one that gives the impression that you can fix relationships by simply applying rules that you learn. It doesn't really get into the driving forces of what gets people into the relationship situations that they find themselves in before they start reading it - and these are always subconscious drivers that need to be understood and learned patterns and responses changed. Otherwise, all you do is try to apply things that are foreign to you, and in the long run that cannot work and isn't realistic. Try [[ASIN:097382221X Fit for Love: Find Your Self and Your Perfect Mate]], and then read this. I found that the two in tandem work well, but you need both.
B000001DU5|4.0|I got this compilation of hits from the 80's band TEARS FOR FEARS because of the cult movie DONNIE DARKO. I never was a fan of 80s music coming from a background of jazz and classic rock, however the soundtrack of the movie was so musically in gear in what was going on from that time, I thought what the hell,let me pick this up. Upon playing the set, I was totally chagrined with the bouyant hooks and melodies these guys churned out. Mad World is probably the highlight of the set and also the one song that really knocked me out in the movie that warrented me to search this CD out.
B000P2A256|5.0|I love this CD. I've been listening to it everyday in the car for two weeks straight.
B000PHX8C0|2.0|Does anyone else think this band is just trying too hard to be accepted by the metal fans of the world?  They just seem so forced to me.  As far as I'm concerned, all their stuff sounds pretty much the same.  Bottom line: I believe they're always going to be a \\"wanna-be\\" band, trying to show everyone how \\"heavy\\" they are.  Any of you clowns who have been bamboozled by them, here's a hot tip, check out the new Behemoth \\"The Apostasy\\", or the new Obituary \\"Xecutioner's Return\\", or for real thrash the new Exodus this fall, or new Testament next March.
1594489505|2.0|I loved the Kite Runner, which too had its moments of despair.  However, A Thousand Splendid Suns has to be one of the most depressing novels ever written.  The characters endure unending sorrows.  This book leaves the reader hopeless, although it claims otherwise.  There were only rare moments of peace and lightheartedness.  I strongly recommend the Kite Runner, and feel badly that I will tell my friends to avoid A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Although life in Afghanistan may truly have been as mournful as depicted in the novel, I choose to have at least some entertainment value in the books I read.  I hope the next novel will prove less tragic.  Also, why did the author change his writing style at the end from past tense to present?  It felt choppy and disjointed.

B0001GF2DS|5.0|The theme song to this movie still sends chills down my spine! This gritty tale was one of several that set the bar for great westerns. Clint Eastwood didn't have to be muscle bound or loud to be a convincing 'tough hombre'. And of course, who could forget the wicked 'Angel Eyes'? The movie also incorporates some of the horrors of the Civil War era while we focus on the quest for hidden gold. Who will get to the cached gold in the graveyard first?<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B0002TT0NW|1.0|I was very pleased with the first Harry Potter film. The school was just as I had imagined it in the book, most of the actors did a very good job representing their character (particularly Hagrid, Snape, and Dumbledore), the music was positively wonderful and fit perfectly, and it had a kind of charm to it that was simply fantastic. The second movie (despite being my least favorite book) was even better.<br /><br />Characters:<br />However, this new movie takes everything the first two did and throws it away. To start with, the actor that replaced the old Dumbledore is dreadful. He turns the wise old wizard, the only man \\"He-who-must-not-be-named\\" ever feared and turns him into a character of the dopey school principal. I also hated the way Lupin was portrayed. He was nothing like he was in the book. In the book, he was one of my favorite characters but the movie turned him into a bland, uninteresting teacher. It was also completely ridicules how the wizards (even at school) were wearing normal clothes. In the books, wizards don't even know how to where normal clothes when it is necessary. I'm not even sure how they managed to turn Malfoy into a sissy baby.<br /><br />Plot:<br />The plot is manipulated in ways that are completely unnecessary (things like changing the time when Harry got his new broomstick). It also lingered on unimportant parts, and cut down or left out entirely important and interesting parts. The scene in the shrieking shack (one of my favorite parts in the book) was cut down terribly. The only part that was done well was the part with the time-turner.<br /><br />Mood<br />I also hated the new mood of the movie. The director tries to give it a darker feel, but it ends up drastically overdone, to the point of being extremely pretentious. However, some parts of the movie are simply silly for silly's sake and are not pulled off successfully. One such scene is the night bus. The same thing is done with he portrayal of Professor Trelawny. She is made into a whimsical character, rather than a realistic one with funny qualities. Throughout the whole movie, the director completely looses the entire feel of harry Potter. He could have made it darker without completely discarding the first two.<br /><br />Music:<br />I also hated John William's new score. The new music composed is significantly less lyrical than the first and takes out the sense of \\"wonder\\" the first two had. Even the main theme is only played for several seconds at the beginning. To me, the old music had a much greater emotional effect and fit much better with the feel of the books.<br /><br />Continuity<br />However, the worst thing in this new movie was how the new director completely changed the orientation of Hogwarts, the students' school. The school now looks completely different. Nothing is in the same place it was before. There is now a giant clock tower at the entrance, and Hagrid's cabin has been moved from a flat pasture within sight of the school to a rocky hillside hidden in a small valley. The Wamping Willow was not in the same place, there was a bridge that didn't appear in the first two,<br /><br />I really hated this movie. It's as if the new director wanted to completely disregard everything done before him and pretend as though, not only that no previous movies had been made, but that it was his own story as well. The only reason this movie was worth watching is because it stuck loosely to the magnificent plot J.K Rowling crafted in the book.an a realistic one with funny qualities.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you're a fan of the \\"Life on Earth\\" and \\"Living Planet\\" series, \\"Planet Earth\\" comes highly recommended.     While not as in-depth as the first two series, \\"Planet Earth\\" more than makes up for this in terms of sheer imagery. The visions of natural beauty and wonder this series offers is literally a breath of fresh air from most current fare laced with the artificiality of CGI.     Aside from the hefty use of time-lapsed video and super slow motion, none of the shots taken in these series were altered in any way. This is our planet caught in her most rawest and grandest, defying anyone not to be awed by her majesty and power.    While no one single program could ever document everything that our planet has to offer, \\"Planet Earth\\" is an incredible achievement in nature filmatography. And unless you have the deep pockets of a business tycoon or the unlimited funding of a first world country, you will never, EVER get to personally experience all the sights caught here in your lifetime.    So do yourself a favor and purchase this series as soon as you can.
B000O178BY|5.0|This superb collection of noisy music from NIN really makes your body move while making you think about how government and religion abuse power.  Reznor's well crafted lyrics really captures the spirit of the United States today, even though his album claims to be about a time a decade or more in the future.  As usual, he pulls no punches when characterizing the attitudes of both presidents and prelates.  This disc should be required listening for anyone elected to public office.    If you like NIN, you'll love this new release.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Chalk it up to Fox for dropping the ball when it came to believing in this show.  They put it in a bad time slot and didnt support it (at all).  Maybe the subtext of a civil war bothered them on some level.    To be honest.. it's a difficult show to describe to someone in a way that makes them want to see it.  When you say the words 'sci-fi western' most people kindof look at you funny.  Sci-fi western is indeed the pretense of the show, but it's not what it's about.      What it's about is 9 characters, breaking out of tv cliche in every scene.  I want to say it's got some of the best dialogue you've ever heard, and you'll be quoting an episode for days after you've watched it.      And you'll realize tv programmers couldn't see the beauty of it... most of popular nighttime drama these days is about how murders and court cases are performed... with the human backstories diminished or cut all together.  Shows that examine our humanity are just unpopular in this country right now, IMHO. I don't know why, but I see it when I turn on the TV.      If you like human drama, wonderful dialogue, and complex character motivations... check this show out.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Sorry, but I feel I must make a minor correction to the Amazon Plot Synopsis since I am a former B-52 nuclear weapons specialist and now edit web sites. The synopsis erroneously states that the B-58 squadron is on a \\"routine training mission\\" when an error diverts them to Russia. Actually, the squadron is on a Combat Patrol. The USAF never carries nuclear weapons on training flights. They used to fly combat air patrols as they did in \\"Fail-Safe\\" (called \\"Chrome Dome\\")until 1966 when a \\"Broken Arrow\\" incident occurred. A B-52 collided with a KC-135 tanker during refueling and dropped its four Mark-28 thermonuclear weapons around Palomares, Spain. Since then the USAF ceased Chrome Dome. Incidentally, the B-52 intentionally released its nuclear payload as it is designed to do (in either a \\"safe\\" or \\"armed\\" configuration) in an emergency. I never understood why the film makers called the B-58 a \\"Vindicator\\" when its real name is \\"Hustler\\".
B000PKG4SC|5.0|When you've got it, you've got it! And it just shows that it doesn't matter how old you are as a performer - Bassey has got IT to burn. Dame Shirley Bassey is back better than ever with an album that would give any of the one-hit \\"Lohan/Hilton/Spears\\" wonders more than a run for their money. Shirley's version of Pink's \\"Get The Party Started\\" is almost a Bond Theme for the new millennium! This septuagenarian diva has a Top 10 UK album and deservedly so. If the likes of Madonna and Kylie and Cher keep re-inventing themselves - why not Shirley. You go girl!!!!
B000IOM1RI|4.0|I know it's out of the movie, but it's targeted AT the movie and not just a general mush of music.    Their regular music is much more hardcore than what's on this album.    Though I gotta give Kickapoo and The Final Showdown the honors for the greatest songs on the album. They almost compete with Tribute and Wonderboy
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Very dissapointing.  Production is good, songs are boring and lifeless.  Rush's downward spiral continues.  The last GREAT Rush album was 'Moving Pictures', the last GOOD rush album was 'Counterparts'.  In all honestly, the downward spiral for rush began with the song \\"New World Man\\" on signals.  I had high hopes for S&A based on the hype and the tease opening seconds of \\"Far Cry\\" from their website.....wow!  could be like Hemispheres.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  These guys just can't write good songs anymore and Geddy's vocals are really starting to falter.  How can these be the same guys that wrote 'Natural Science', 'Tom Sawyer', or 'The Trees'?
075640407X|5.0|As others have already done so I will not summarize the plot of the book. It seems that every time I crack open a new fantasy book that the author has no real vision and in many cases is simply writing escapist crap that no one who cares about the genre should read. I love fantasy yet the genre itself is filled with thinly veiled Tolkien rip offs, which is why this book is so very good. It is not the world that the author creates that makes it so excellent but rather the style and grace with which the tale is told. The tale itself is mainly flashback and this choice only adds to the way the novel unfolds. The writing is also superb. Indeed at times the writing is alomst like poetry and is wonderful to read.Kvothe is a charcter that is burned onto the mind and it is almost like we can see him there before us. With authors like this showing fantasy might just be in fine shape after all.
B0000028PI|4.0|I was having an \\"Alice Cooper\\" conversation yesterday, the person claimed to be a fan but had never heard of this album. So I decided to post a review for others who may be unaware of its existence. But, considering the number of reviews...I guess that's not that much of a problem!!<br /><br />This is my personal favorite Cooper album and is also the closest thing to Prog-Rock he has (admittedly I haven't heard everything). It is quite an interesting album, being based upon a story jointly written by Alice and Sandman/Stardust/American Gods author Neil Gaimen (also get the 3-issue comic series if you can).<br /><br />There's not a bad song on the thing but \\"Bad Place Alone\\", \\"You're My Temptation\\" and \\"Unholy War\\" stand out and my personal favorite is the final track \\"Cleansed by Fire\\".<br /><br />There are several \\"guests\\" - Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell who sings on \\"Stolen Prayer\\" and \\"Unholy War\\", co-wrote the former and wrote the latter. And the keyboardist is Derek Sherinian, Dream Theater's keysman in the late 90s.<br /><br />If you like Alice Cooper, like prog-rock or just like good Rock n' Roll in general - get this! Get this ASAP!!
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a phenomenal album from U2.  The only question is what songs are not awesome.  The answer is that the following are the only songs that are merely respectable:  Acrobat and Love, which are the last 2 songs.  Every other song is great.

B000RJO578|5.0|Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg have proven that lightning can strike twice with their 2007 comedy \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"  As was the case with \\"[[ASIN:B000B2YR8I Shaun of the Dead]],\\" they are following in the grand tradition of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks in \\"[[ASIN:B000G6BLWE Young Frankenstein]]\\" by embracing the genre they are spoofing and taking everything that happens dead seriously, which is what makes it hysterical.  Plus, once again Pegg and his sidekick Nick Frost have created characters that have heart, so that we care about them as well as laughing at their antics (of everything that happened in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" the part I remember most is Shaun being upset over the fate of his mother).  So when we get to the final act of \\"Hot Fuzz\\" and the film actually slips into an even higher gear, we get to root them on all that harder.<br /><br />This time around Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a guy who is no bumbling Inspector Closseau.  In fact, Sergeant Angel is so competent that his bosses want to get rid of him because he is making everybody else in the police service look bad.  So Angel is banished to Sanford, a perfect little English village supposedly devoid of crime.  Of course Angel finds cause to arrest just about everybody he runs into, only to be informed by his new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), that they look at things differently in Sanford.  Everybody is town speaks of \\"the Greater Good,\\" and it seems that we are being set up for your standard story about a hard core true believer learning that the spirit of the law is as important as the letter of the law.  Angel is partnered with PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), and we have the requisite pair for the buddy part of the picture and it looks like all of the pieces are in place.<br /><br />However, there is something rotten in the village of Sanford, personified by Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the local rich guy.  There might not be any crime in Sanford, but there sure are a lot of accidents and Angel quickly figures out that these suspicious accidents might be sneaky murders.  The payoff for this whole bit is most decidedly English in nature, which is part of what makes it so funny, especially when old hands like Billie Whitelaw and Edward Woodward are playing some of the eccentric characters.  I do not know what the record is for most cuts in a film, but with \\"Hot Fuzz\\" film editor Chris Dickens has got to be in the running.  This movie is not just cut like an action film, it is cut like an action film on speed, which becomes another part of the fun.  An hour into this film I thought there was only a half-hour left, but it turned out we were only halfway through this entertaining film.  As for what I shall remember most from this action comedy, it would have to be the fate of the villain Skinner and one of the more memorable \\"boy, that has got to hurt\\" moments of all time.ts and Angel quickly figures out that these suspicious accidents might be sneaky murders.

B000O178BY|5.0|A nice new album from NIN. Kind of a mix between old and new. It has definetely a different beat to it...but the classic Trent Reznor lyrics and vocals. Some say that NIN has lost it...I say they just adapt and overcome. They always come out with something that's different than the crap that's already out there now...and they haven't conformed to mainstream junk. If you're a NIN fan, atleast buy it and give it a shot. For me, for just about every NIN album, it took me a couple listening's to start to dig it. At first it's kind of like...what the heck...and once you absorb it all in...it's pretty tight.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is hard to put into words my admiration and respect for this album. It was revolutionary and groundbreaking when it first came out and its enormous presence still lingers to this day.Every song is an emotional rollercoaster and has much more meaning than many of the songs that are currently on the radio. Radiohead is one of my favorite bands in terms of their sound but their importance and meaning found in their songs cannot be understated.Every time I listen to his album,I am able to find new meaning and beauty in each song.This is part of the magic of listening to this band.Radiohead is and will always remain \\"the only band that matters\\".
B000RJO578|5.0|I thought Shaun of the Dead may have been a fluke but these guys outdid themselves with Fuzz.  Avoid thinking of it as a parody; this is nothing of the sort as defined by recent American in-your-face parody styles (such as Scary Movie, et.al.)  Instead, British parody is much more subtle and witty as redefined by this brilliant film.  But be warned.  The 2nd half of this movie is quite fast paced at times.    Pay attention or you'll miss many great visual and audio gags.  For example, the townfolk refer to their town as a \\"model village\\" (referring to its reputation as a great place to live).  At the end there's a confrontation in a scale model of the village.  Get it -- model - village.  This movie is loaded with subtle references that require the viewer to pay attention to fully appreciate.  I was grinning ear to ear for 2 hours until my cheeks hurt.  Enjoy.

B000QCUB8I|3.0|When I first saw the D.A.N.C.E. music video on DailyMotion I couldn't wait to get my hands on this album. The song just made me want to get up and dance. As soon as I got the disk I started listening to it on my good headphones as to not loose any of the quality but immediately was bothered by the over production of this album. Distortion got in the way of the clean beats and made me worry my headphones were shorting out. Similar techniques were used throughout and although the songs very in speed and tone the beat and craft can be repetitive. I decided to give the album a chance and listened to it more. It did grow om me. Still it is a bit of a disappointment.

0061142026|3.0|I found out about this book (as many people likely will) because I saw the movie preview and was intrigued. As a lover of fantasy stories, I decided to check it out. I enjoyed the descriptions and the quirky turns of phrase, but I would have liked a little more story. The characters were interesting enough to lend enough material for a book twice as long. I felt that some story lines emerged and disappeared equally quickly. Gaiman glosses over weeks or even months of traveling and adventures, material that would likely have made the most interesting parts of the story. As I said, Gaiman's voice and diction are great, but the story left a bit to be desired.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I watched this document for the first time last night, it drew me in from the 30 minute mark and I could not leave my seat until it was over. Befroe I wrote this review I read others. I wanted to read others who felt differently than I did.   I saw that some were upset at Mr. Mc Namara; for those of you that are upset at his culpability and duplicity in the Viet Nam Action, I ask you to re-examine two points. 1. the president offered him two cabinet spots to which Robert said he was not qualified (for either) but like most men he seized upon an opportunity. 2. Robert told President -elect Kennedy that he should get out of Viet Nam as soon as possible, then Kennedy was killed (and not by Lee Oswald).  For those of you who do not regognize a man feeling his mortality and wanting in some way to explain his folly, keep living. For those of you who believe if you were in the same posistion you would have done something different than follow the instructions of you boss(who knows even less than you) then I laugh at you. The reason America was in Viet Nam is the same reason we are have gone to Iraq. Policy set by a few men and a citizenry too complacent to say enough is enough. Do you see a similarity between our time and theirs. Thank you Mr. Mc Namara, I doubt any of our current leaders in the future will have the courage to document anything.
1594489505|5.0|I read the Kite Runner, the first novel by Hosseini, recommended by an avid reader friend of mine (thanks Ann!) and I loved it.  I will never forget Hassan.  He will stay in my memory forever.  I was expecting to be disappointed in Hosseini's latest novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, but BOY was I was wrong.  Mariam and Laila two women with strong, loving hearts fight for their lives to stay true, to outlast, and with all that's going on to love.  I finished the book in 4 days because I could not put it down.  It made me laugh, made me stay at the edge of my seat and it made me cry.  Just like the character Hassan in Kite Runner, I will never forget Mariam and Laila.  Bravo, Hosseini, you've done it again.  I can't wait for another masterpiece from Hosseini.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|A german woman gets stranded in the middle of Mojave Desert and finds refuge in a small cafe motel establishment, run by a very overpowering black woman who has just chased off her husband and left basically alone with minimal cafe staff, along with the desert locals and her kids. Brenda, the black woman motel owner, has an extremely domineering personality, and a crushed spirit. The german woman, Jasmine, brought to the Bagdad Cafe by a desert freeway illusion, is soon to become Brenda's key to a brighter life. Her foreign embrace of this smalltown American out of nowhere community, is the tune that brings new life to just about everyone she meets. The music soundtrack to this movie could not be more appropriate, in opening credits to the jumpy piano score.<br />Jasmine, has brought a hobby to the cafe, in a magic box set with instructions to entertain and amuse in the world of illusion. This hobby soon registers with the truck drivers who have bypassed the cafe before, but are willing to stop for a breath of magic. The cafe soon becomes a crowd pleaser with many regulars, and is easily transformed back to the prior doldrums, when Jasmine is forced to leave after investigation of an expired green card. However, this does not keep the magical heroine away for long, as she is soon back to reunite with the now changed Brenda.<br />This movie packs an emotional punch with the battered beast in all of us, who must learn to survive in a world of spiritual magic, if our wellbeing is to thrive.

B00005JO9J|5.0|Witty ... for a plot where soon to be friends are fierce competitors at the same time and for truly witty dialogues and sharp exchanges on the numerous hospital aisles of Seattle Grace.    classy .. for the 'classical hospital setting', what better framework could a director whish for to stage-manage a tacky drama? There is all present at once: blood, despair, hopefulness, narrow escapes from the deathbed, and sometimes death leaving their imprints on 5 both hopeful and insecure interns who starve to prove themselves in an unforgiving OR.    sexy ... for the usual attraction pulling some of the characters into weird intermingled relations spanning from friendship to sexy encounters with one another.    lifty ... since the elevator traps people temporarily inside and serves a repeating trigger for twists and turns in the story    dreamy ... for a somewhat lunatic - and at the same time wonderfully disturbed main female character dreaming about the knight in the white coat, alias Dr. McDreamy..    twisty ... with many unexpected twists and turns throughout the season (some of which will not be revealed till season 2)    edgy ... for 5 well drafted opposing characters which end up as friends at last .. but do they really? A great and very self-absorbed character played by the Emmy winner Christina Oh is destined to kill for the chance of scrubbing in at the OR...    it's all there .. to suck you in and make you watch it as it would be the most gripping drama series there is.. with a truly wonderful soundtrack..

She's pretty top notch and the actress playing opposite is gang-busters!  What a voice!  Such passion.  I'm sure we'll all be very familiar with her name soon!

B0000640VO|5.0|Audrey Tautou does her finest work ever in Amelie; a beautiful film about an introverted young lady who strives to help others.  Amelie's benevolence is touching and inspires confidence in the human spirit and our capacity to see that people are happy in life.  The film is complex, thoughtful and artistic.  It's one that you will eagerly want to watch more than once to pick up on all the subtle messages.  Highly recommended and appropriate for all ages!

B000FVBLEI|5.0|First of all,there are too many people that won't let the \\"SHADOWS FALL\\" thing go. To all of you, SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET A LIFE! Now,on with one of the best,if not the best METAL CD of 2006. This CD has it all from start to finish. Brutal screams,wicked drums and some of the best guitar work out there. Every song has it's own way of kicking you in the face. I know a lot of you out there are tired of singing, screaming, singing,screaming. There are not very many bands that do it well,but ALL THAT REMAINS is one of the best. If you dont believe me just listen to the last two CD's from IN FLAMES tried to pull off...NOT EVEN CLOSE!
B000R8YC3G|5.0|MOVIE 5 of 5  For anyone who has seen this film its full of laughs and gore.  With a brilliant script and an all-star cast this is destined to become a cult classic.    PICTURE 5 of 5  The HD release is a step up from the already good looking dvd.  If a pretty picture is what you're looking for look no further.    AUDIO 4 of 5  Great soundtrack and a very decent surround sound setup.    EXTRAS 4 of 5  Two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, extended scenes, outtakes, mini features...these guys went the whole nine yards.      OVERALL 5 of 5  This HD DVD is the real deal, it isn't much of a question of should you buy it, it's how soon can you buy it.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I was highly impressed by the contrast between the light hearted and the dark in this soundtrack.  That is part of the special magic of the Harry Potter books, of course, but I've never felt the movies, except for the first one, really captured it until now.  The soundtrack for The Order of the Phoenix is relatively short, around 45 minutes in total.  The tracks are arranged more by mood than by their placement within the movie, which can be a bit confusing at first, but I enjoyed the sprightly beginning of \\"Fireworks.\\"  I also found \\"Dumbledore's Army\\" and \\"The Room of Requirement\\" especially appealing.  The tracks relating to Dolores Umbridge are interesting, too, in that they are able to convey her cloying surface charm and inner nastiness highly effectively.  This is also true of \\"The Ministry of Magic\\".<br /><br />The darker tracks, especially \\"The Death of Sirius\\" and \\"Possession,\\" were well able to depict the tension and horror of those moments.  I also enjoyed the forboding qualities of \\"Another Story\\" and \\"Journey to Hogwarts.\\"<br /><br />This CD well encapsulates the best qualities of the Harry Potter books and movies, and  I recommend it wholeheartedly.
0762188669|5.0|After many failed attempts to assassinate Charles de Gaulle by the local French militant organization, an outside professional (the Jackal) is hired.  The way in which Forsyth puts together a story, it has us even rooting for the assassins.<br /><br />Forsyth's observant mind is at full force: with detailed detective work and the assassin's planning stages.  Wonderful visualization and knowledge of the French culture and architecture.  My only gripe is the French dialect slows down the reading pace.  This is a complete and well thought out novel.<br /><br />Wish you well<br />Scott

1594489505|4.0|Hosseini's style is a bit wordy, but it works! At first, I felt a little bogged down as details expanded more and more on the page. Getting past that was easy as I became drawn into the nuances of the lives of each character.  I was given a glimpse of a society I know virtually nothing about and it was quite an eye-opener...sad, brutal, hopeless, heart-breaking. And yet, these women find solace, comradery, and fortitude to live another day. How much can the human spirit endure? Read this book and you will know. Both, Kiterunner and 1000 Splendid Suns, are unforgettable. The brutal honesty pulls no punches and you are left wishing for better answers, better endings, less helplessness - someone, ANYone to step in and make their lives easier, happier.

I had the sound set at level 50 which was plenty loud, and when I would change between the PS3 and the Xbox 360 functions, the PS3 300 Blu Ray version was more quiet and sounded slightly muffed.  It was only recognizable when comparing it to the HD-DVD version.  Again, the sound for the HD-DVD was better, and to get the same level of \\"loudness\\" I had to go from level 50 to about 55 56.

B000089RVR|5.0|If you look at the bands I rate this type of music is not in my field at all. In my entire c.d. collection hers are the only ones I have that are on some type of major label. Anyway Dido is one my favorite female vocalists. Her songs are beautiful in general. I also enjoy the fact that she is a pretty down to earth \\"pop\\" artist. I have a feeling she will still be around long after some of her fellow artists have gone bye bye. The hot spots on this c.d. are white flag and life for rent. The song that is over the top is Don't leave home. I know you can't burn out a c.d. but you can burn out your freinds with one song over and over again. Don't leave home is the song I'm not allowed to play anymore.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|After all the hype I had to buy this movie.  After watching the whole thing I was a little let down that this was all people were talking about.  I knew most of the information Al shares in the movie and if I had to see him ride the hi boy around the stage one more time pointing out his dots on the screen I was going to freak.    I think this could be very informative for someone who does not know much about how global warming works or what it is but for those who are up on it skip the film and save the electricity.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I was excited when Kelly's new album was coming out.  I love her music and have followed her from Idol till now.  Kelly is still having growing pains in trying to find herself as an artist.  Although it is easy to take help from Clive Davis...Kelly chose to carve her own path artistically with this record.  Kelly falls slightly short overall, but her efforts are to be commended.  She has experienced true success quickly and a little bit of reality check may be what helps her find her balance as an artist.  I predict her next album will be better as most of us learn from our mistakes and take our successes and improve upon them.

My only complaint is that Mr Schwager has not written a recent update, which of he did I would buy.

1579126278|5.0|In perhaps, one of the finest of all Hercule Poirot mysteries, Agatha Christie crafts an ingenious plot with nothing less than stunning revelations at the conclusion. Her sheer genius leaves the reader breathless.  Set in the small town of Kings Abbot, a retired Hercule Poirot becomes involved in solving the scandalous murder of Roger Ackroyd, the town's richest inhabitant.  Unable to stay away from mystery for long, Poirot's interest is piqued and he is easily convinced into joining the investigation.  Unlike other stories to follow, this one is narrated by the pleasant voice of Dr. James Sheppard, who chronicles the events and accompanies Poirot in Hastings absence. Clues abound and everyone at Fernly Park is a suspect.  Only Poirot seems to understand the meaning of what he sees, not the inspector in charge of the case, the polite Dr. Sheppard or the reader can distinguish the significance or the insignificance of the many clues and converstations laid out in the story. This story in particular, in my opinion ,is a sample of Christie's best writing. The way the the reader is manipulated will be emulated in many novels to follow by other mystery writers.  The Murder of Roger Ackroyd comes to a stunning conclusion, while the reader simply shakes their head acknowledging that Poirot is indeed master of the \\"little gray cells.\\"
B000OLGCHA|3.0|John Williams in the first three HP movies composed wonderful themes for each and every character/moment.  After Star Wars, where he was forced to repeat and work with themes over and over, HP gave him a new lease on life.  But here Mr. Hooper lets us down.  First, he only uses \\"Hedwig's Theme\\".  Aren't the others available or equally interesting?      His music is very atmospheric - that's good - but each track apparently goes no where.  It all sounds like background music for a theme that's missing.  \\"Delores Umbridge's Theme\\" is jaunty enough - anachronistic to her character, without a trace of evil - but we at least hear a theme.  The \\"Fireworks\\" track - Fred and George leaving Hogwarts - was delightful.  I actually like the folk element entering into the story a bit.  But track after track sounds like accompaniment to a theme that no one played.  Come on, Warner Bros., surely you can do better than this!  (Don't get me started on the director either.)  In my worst days as a composer I wrote as well as that.    THe other problem is the ordering of the tracks.  Okay, JW did this on the early Star Wars movies, too, and we all hated it then.  Some Broadway musicals had to re-order things, too, to accomodate the side breaks of LPs.  They re-ordered stuff when CDs came out.  So did the \\"Final\\" version of Star Wars 4,5 &6.  There is no sense of pacing corresponding to the movie.  It sounds great!  But to quote a famous author, it is \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Highly recommended, a happy addition to our DVD collection.  It is hard to believe that the network cancelled this series so quickly, it is such a fun show to watch.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A must see for anyone who admires Edward Nortons work.  He is a master at picking the right movies to appear in. The story is great and keeps you guessing till the end. The chemistry between Norton and Jessica Beil is not an illusion,  can you say too hot to handle!  A fabulous work of art!  Disappointed there were no Oscar nominations for this deserving film!  Boo to the Oscars!!!  This is not just a movie about a magician.
B000OVLBHG|4.0|I like this movie.  You can't take it seriously though.  It is extrememly corny in a lot of respects but is fun to watch.  However it does not hold true to the book hardly at all.  I would recommend watching the movie first, then read the book.  If you do it the other way around you will probably hate the movie.  The book is very good in the sense that it is a lot \\"darker\\" than the movie.  It explains \\"Rico's\\" physical and mental torment during training, and in the life of a combat soldier.  There is very little contact between both sexes in the book as opposed to the movie in which they all live and \\"shower\\" together.  Neither the book or the movie are a waste of time.  I recommend both definately.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Rewiewers said enough about this brilliant production and I 100% agree with raviest of them.My point is audience's usual behavior on opera;crazy applause to the primo uomo(wonderful Sarah Connoly),same to prima donna(spirited,very talented De Niese)however people doesn't justice to other first class performers there.Surely the whole cast is amazing,all of them deserve people's cheers,orchestra and Mr Christie present some new interpretative ideas to this very popular Handel's masterpiece but I was a bit disappointed because Christophe Dumaux didn't take a deserved outstanding ovation on his infectious Ptolomeo singing.In fact,I can't remember any more bruising \\"L'empio,sleale,indegno\\" rendition (same to \\"Domeró la tua fierezza\\")than this one by him.What a hell of a singer is this guy!I heard his amazing artistry on Met Rodelinda last year(as usual and a bit unfair,people was all about Andreas Scholl on stage)Anyway,I wish Glyndebourne had pay him a high fee for such a brilliant performance and he goes into a studio recording to a solo cd right away.
055321277X|4.0|I picked up this book, because I was familiar with the plot of the book and thought it might be interesting; however, it was my familiarity with the story that made me not enjoy the book as much as I could have enjoyed it.  It is a bit difficult to fully enjoy a story when you know the ending and the main points of the plot.  The story centers around the events that unfold after a respected doctor develops a potion that allows him to isolate his \\"dark side\\" or evil nature into a seperate being.  Dr. Jekyll struggles with the new being, Edward Hyde and eventually both beings meet their dead as Dr. Jekyll fails to win his battle against Hyde.  It is a suspenseful story, and what makes it even more enjoyable is how brief it is. I finished this book during a 2 and a 1/2 hour flight.  Given the suspense of the book and the brief nature of it, I definitley reccomend that everyone read this book.  I do think that it is better if the reader is not familiar with the story, as this would probably allow them to enjoy the book even more.    A word about this particular edition of the book.  It comes with the novel at the front, and a short foreword at the end of the story.  It is definitley more than enough to provide the reader with a background for the book.

1400063515|1.0|Oh dear. If you've read Taleb's previous book, Fooled By Randomness, don't bother with The Black Swan. Fooled By Randomness was deservedly successful, filled with contrarian thinking that makes sense, delivered in an original and engaging style. But success went to Taleb's head. In The Black Swan, Taleb seems more interested in talking about himself. He doesn't do his reputation any favors by doing so. He describes what he seems to think of as charming quirkiness, nearly giving an octogenarian Nobel Prize laureate a heart attack by heckling him at a lecture. Taleb loves to take blowhards down a notch or two. But when someone challenges his ideas, it's because they haven't read his book, or they didn't understand his brilliance.<br /><br />The Black Swan jumps around, switching from a tale of a non-existent Russian author to Taleb's experiences in Lebanon to the mathematics of probability. The language is repetitive, using \\"black swan\\" and \\"extremistan\\" long after their cuteness has worn off.<br /><br />Read Fooled By Randomness or Devil Take the Hindmost or Fortune's Formula. Read Harry Potter. Anything but The Black Swan.
6305622914|5.0|I watched \\"Full Monty\\" directed by Peter Cattaneo first time when it was released ten years ago in 1997, became a surprising hit, and was nominated for several Academy awards. The movie instantly became one of my favorites. I don't know how close to the realities of British life it is/was but \\"Full Monty\\" is irresistible, and it features the songs of Donna Summer and Tom Jones that fit adorably to the story. I saw it again few days ago and it has not lost any of its original charm.  It is funny but it is more in the realm of dramedy which is my favorite genre.<br /><br />Few things I've noticed this time:<br /><br />Nothing is more tiring than doing nothing. Men are really very sensitive and insecure creatures. They have to have respect for themselves and this is a great movie about how far the desperate men would go to regain it.<br /><br />I think every boy would dream about having a father like Carlyle's Gaz - he is more like a buddy, not a father.<br /><br />Did I mention that after seeing the movie first three times I bought a Donna Summer's CD?<br /><br />And...<br /><br />The finals scene is spectacular. Our heroes learned something during the two weeks they were preparing for the show. They learned how to like themselves the way they are and how to respect themselves and with that knowledge came something else: \\"coordination, skill, timing, fitness, and grace\\" and they were fabulous during their one and only performance.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|Stay is a wonderful movie to watch, by which I mean, it is a wonderful movie to look at.  Cinematography is superb, the entire film seems distant and surreal, a feeling reinforced by the haunting, chilly blue/gray wash.  Art direction is equally inspired.  The architecture and interior design are eye-popping - this is certainly a well-endowed university/hospital!  Add to this the clever, (if not painfully and blatantly clever), camera moves where people, settings, and situations morph into one another - and you have a film that is eager to delight the eye.<br /><br />The problem is that this is the only part of you that is delighted.  I won't give away the gadget, such as it is, but I will say that the nature of the gadget necessitates a distance from the protagonists, all the key players are held at arm's length, even the tormented Henry.  Everyone we meet in Stay has gone through some sort of catastrophic event, and yet, we feel no sympathy at all.  This is because we never get to know them; all we're really aware of is the deliberate confusion.  The movie is staggeringly slow; it is rather like watching exotic and beautiful tropical fish swirling lazily in a tank - if one of them eats another  - who cares?<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is very good as Henry, but one wonders why he would reprise his role from the splendid film, United States Of Leland, so blatantly, seems risky.  A really terrific cast is given almost nothing to do, Naomi Watts, Elizabeth Reaser, Bob Hoskins, and Janeane Garofalo appear - and I use the word advisedly - give us the benefit of their recognizable faces, and disappear.  Ewan McGregor, a fine actor, makes the most of the limitations inherent in his role by giving a panicked performance worthy of a trapped Hitchcock hero.<br /><br />Director Marc Foster gave us the brilliant Monster's Ball, where character and stunning imagery propelled every frame.  His Finding Neverland had appeal, but certainly did not occupy the same rarified atmosphere.  In Stay, something very, very different is going on.  Character does not drive action, action, or lack thereof, drives character.<br /><br />Beautiful to watch, fairly interesting gizmo providing the big reveal, the \\"aha moment.\\"  Ultimately it reminded me of the old joke, \\"You've got a right to think your wife is being unfaithful if you move from New York to California and realize one day you have the same mailman.\\", very different is going on.  Character does not drive action, action, or lack thereof, drives character.

B000RJO578|5.0|The overriding themes of justice, adversity, and mateship are easy enough to identify with, and in conjuction with the decently written murder mystery could be enough to carry this film for a mainstream audience, but there's also a constant string of kinda old-fashioned subtly comedic moments that will more likely confound than amuse.   It has that thing going on where you never know what to take seriously. So many things happen that make me think what was the point of that, and it's because they don't fit conventions. There was nothing in the movie that made me think I can see what they're going for there and I don't think they achieved it or I think they overdid it. Everything is just it's own thing. There isn't any movie I've ever seen that I can say that about as fully as this one. The recreation of the Point Break scene was probably the most typical formulaic gag in the movie, and one of the few that actually made me laugh.   The most creative/unconventional movie I've ever seen in my life and the only movie I'll admit I'm not smart enough to appreciate.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Darkly beautiful, brash, vulnerable and artistically sound, \\"My December\\" has come early in the career of Kelly Clarkson.  Few artists would have dared show what she has the heart to share with us after what seems to be such a short time.  This collection of songs marks the official end of Kelly's infancy in this business.  She has graduated, with honors, and cemented her place in the elite world of Superstardom.  The brouhaha that ensued with the release of this CD can only serve to propel it to where it rightfully belongs. Those of you who are only familiar with the anthem to retibution, \\"Never Again,\\" have a few surprises in store for them when Kelly tenderly turns the page and begins her first ballad on the CD, \\"Sober.\\" In fact all the ballads on this CD are worthy of being released as singles and able to stand on their own. \\"Be Still\\" - \\"Maybe\\" - \\"Irvine\\" are all varying aspects of Kelly's heart and her journey thus far.  Her career is far, far away from her December and with this, the first offering of Kelly's own works, it looks like it will take many,many more December's of her life to come and go before anyone will want to close the door on this talented, multi-faceted rock star/chanteuse.

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I just recently bought a PS3, and the first Blu-ray movie I watched was 300.  A little grainy, but it still looks great.  It does seem a little quiet, but that's nothing that can't be fixed by... turning up the volume.    As for the issues with Blu-ray not having as many extras, I'm curious, how many people actually watch the extra material?  I own lots of DVDs and I can't say that I have ever, not even once, watched even one minute of extra material.  I buy movies to... watch the movie.    Anyone else the same way?

It is in my opinion, the greatest album made by anyone at any time, ever.  It makes you long to be newly in love, to feel those first butterflies in your stomach.  Album favorites are Astral Weeks, Sweet Thing and Madam George but every song is beautiful and the album flows effortlessly.  I can't say enough about this one.  Seriously, if you are a fan of Van or of music in general, you won't be disappointed.
B000UBMSB8|3.0|Not sure why one would buy the 4 disk SE and not the 5 disk SE, but I am sure people have their reasons.  Price might be an issue, with the extra disk costing $25 more.  If you're not that big of a fan than you should for the 2-disk edition and not the 4 disk edition.  If you are a big fan you should just for the 5-disk.  To see a workprint of a film is a rare and wonderful thing indeed (the workprint is in fact the extra disk of the 5 disk version).  I have the feeling that the 4 disk version won't be around for a long time, with most people opting for the two options above.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I'd been waiting forever, it seems, to see this film.  True to trademark Cuar&oacute;n artistic flair and drama, it was gorgeous.

Also the pictures and insight Arnold gives of the numerous athletes in the book are great for motivation (seeing a picture of someone pull up 700 pounds with a smile just makes you pumped!).  Book covers almost every aspect of body building but you'll require additional reading to get down to more specific areas such as dieting, injury management, etc.  Overall, the book is well written, informative; pictures are awesome and have something for almost anyone.
B000QXDED6|2.0|I watched it last night and thought that it was a waste of time. If you liked Gladiator with its sense of realism, you won't like this movie. I sure didn't. Its just like watching a comic book.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|I had high expectations of this film, what with Will Smith, his son, and the down-on-your-luck-single-man-with-a-child bit.  On the side of sentimentality it delivered the prerequisite emotional tugs to heart strings.  But it really did nothing more than that.  I was immensely impressed with the extra footage of the real Chris Gardner and his presence, and wished even more that Smith had embodied even a scrap of it.  From an acting standpoint, it wasn't even a stretch for Smith, though I'm sure working with his son was a learning experience.  I think he ran more in this film than any action film I've ever seen him in.
0553381342|4.0|As certain legal cases continue to generate huge headlines with everybody fighting for their camera close-ups, it shows that \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" will never become irrelevant.<br /><br />The novel is an extremely fun read that eviscerates the New York of the 80s, as well as managing to stay relevant in contemporary times.  Wolfe's novel peers through the windows of all the social strata to meld an infuriating tale of people pretending to look out for the greater good but only engaging in vicious self-preservation.  There aren't many characters in the book whom I found especially likeable and some who I found palatable at first ended up disappointing me. Every twist in the story made things even more unpredictable right up to the epilogue, which I found to be a bit of a let down but a realistic one.  My only real question at the end of the story was the subplot about the $350,000 that the Reverend Bacon couldn't account for; Wolfe seemed to drop the ball on that and I wanted to see where it would end up.<br /><br />This story was originally serialized in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine (!) in 1984-85 but by the time it saw print as a complete novel, it had changed quite a bit.  Sherman McCoy was a writer in the serial, and was a Wall Street financier in the novel.  Wolfe tapped into the temper of the times with that canny switch, and makes the putpouring of anger and resentment against McCoy that much more timely.
0316067598|5.0|The best book that I have read in ages....real life hero stuff.  I thank Marcus Luttrell for choosing the career he did and following through with the courage.  It's important to tell the truth of an American tragedy and the reality of the war we are in.
0783229526|5.0|There's only three things I can say about this movie:  1. It is the dark side of Cheech and Chong.  2. It is Fellini on LSD.  3. It is Gillian's best movie since \\"Brazil\\".
B000O77QD8|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of my favorites and it looks amazing on blu-ray
B000QXDED6|4.0|Has anyone used that line yet?  Or am i the first?  Just kidding.  Overall, i think this film is a little overrated to a degree.  I did enjoy it though, especially(or mainly because of) the action, stunning visuals, and cinematography.  The look of the film is worth a rental alone.  It is extremely violent, but the cgi negates some of that as it makes the brutality seem less...well, brutal.  I didn't like the look of some of the villains, but since it's based on a graphic novel and cgi-heavy i'll give that a pass.<br /><br />The real testament as to whether the film is good or not to me though is not the efx or action, but rather or not if i liked/cared about/rooted for/identified with the characters or not.  The answer would be yes.  They aren't deep characterizations obviously, and the \\"few fighting bravely against great odds\\" theme usually wins me over anyway.  Nevertheless, the movie did make me care about these 300 and i did want them to make it despite me knowing their fate well in advance.<br /><br />So, i would recommend this as a definite watch.  But i'm not in the \\"it's the greatest thing since sliced bread\\" camp either(which is why i bought the cheaper no-frills, sorry, i meant single-disc edition).  Honestly, i would love to see The Matrix and the 300 fans battle it out in a Destroy All Hype contest.  Btw, another credit i'll give to the movie is it peaked my interest even more into the subject matter to the point i ordered the 60's(?) The 300 Spartans(saw a little on tv once, kinda liked it), and the History Channel's Last Stand of the 300 documentary to go along with this.  Might make for a good triple-bill.  Ironically, it didn't make me want to buy or read the graphic novel it was based on(i guess because i just saw it on-screen).  Anyway, can't wait for the sequel  302: Electric Boogaloo.  You know what i'm talkin' about.  (note: if i get 10 unhelpful votes, i'll edit out that last 'joke')
0694011479|4.0|I enjoy reading this book not only to my 18 month old son but for myself.  At the moment he doesn't always sit for the whole book as it is a little long sometimes for a board book.  I feel this book encourages imagine and is simple enough for a toddler to understand!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|This product was actually delivered to me on christmas morning as we were opening presents.  I was extremely surprised at the speedy delivery.  Great season!!!
B00005RG6B|5.0|I got into Queensryche right before I caught them opening up for Metallica in '88.   I burned through 10 copies of Operation Mindcrime in the ensuing years and this video truly captures the show that I saw live back then (and, luckily again in about '05).   I still get goosebumps watching it.    HIGHLY recommended.
B000002GAF|5.0|This was my first Gino Vanelli album.  This music has made the times of my life. Ever since I heard \\"Appaloosa\\" I have wanted to play drums like this.  I have always referred to Gino's style as \\"funk-rock\\" His sound is great!  This album is a \\"must have\\" if you are a Gino fan.  An Absolute Classic!
B000PTYUQG|5.0|Stravinsky conducted by Stravinsky - this super bargain set collects the famous recordings that Stravinsky made of his own works for CBS (now owned by SONY). Even if there are many fine recordings of the core of Stravinsky's works, for instance Ansermet's (Decca) and Ancerl's (Supraphon), the composer's own legacy must be seen as the first choice for any Stravinsky collector - or, indeed, by anyone who wants to have the basic Stravinsky repertoire at home.<br /><br />This boxed set of 22 CDs contains more Stravinsky music than any other contemporary box, and the price is a complete steal (less than $2.5 for each CD, and even cheaper if you buy it used).<br /><br />Here are some examples of what you get for your money:<br /><br />- The early ballets: Firebird, Petroushka, Rite of Spring, Les Noces, Pulcinella, and the later, neo-classical ones (e.g., Agon, Apollon).<br />- The symphonies (in E and in C and in Three Movements).<br />- Oedipus Rex and The Rake's Progress.<br />- Chamber music, such as Ragtime, Septet and Octet.<br />- Jazz suites, and the piano concerto.<br />- Songs and choral works, such as the Mass, the Cantata and the Symphony of Psalms.<br />- Later works, such as Threni.<br />- And much more... (including the Robert Craft recordings that Stravinsky supervised).<br /><br />(For a complete listing of the content on each CD, see SONY's German Webpage.)<br /><br />Sound quality is vintage analogue from the sixties, generally very fine and remastered as well. In addition, the box is of the slim cardboard kind, with each CD in a cardboard sleeve. Booklet is included, but (unfortunately) no texts and translations of libretti.<br /><br />In short, this is an essential set. Warmly recommended even if you already have individual Stravinsky by Stravinsky recordings - I suggest you use them as presents to friends and relatives. Grab and save this one!
B00005JPLW|4.0|Im not going to sit here and give this movie a five. To me, five stars means its flawless and nowadays its hard to find a film with that kind of flow and plus I have my negatives. On a brighter note, first off the special effects are freaking outstanding! Second, character development is surely here. I mean the main charcter just continues to become a ruthless S.O.B. Finally the story line is pretty dam cool especially considering how it ends. Im not gonna spoil it...you have to see this flick and make sure the volume's all the way up!
0345409671|5.0|Finding a good book that is worth taking the time out for, is a rare find indeed.  This review is in response to all the negative reviews that gave this book a one star rating.<br /><br />What people seem to forget about this book - is that it's a work of pure fiction with some over the top references to actual places and events that may or may not have happened / existed (depending on your personal belief).  Yes it has some familiar undertones of the ideas surrounding Catholicism and Christianity, but in reality, the best books take from real life (more often than not) because it's a sure-fire way to get the reader to make a connection with some larger, universal truth. In all honesty, I think that the heart of this story is actually NOT about religion...it is about the false concept of reality, and for the characters of this novel nothings is really ever as it seems.<br /><br />Personally, as someone who was raised Christian but whose currently religion consists of drinking green tea daily and indulging in a guilty pleasure at least once a week (this week - it's going to see the new harry potter flick), I can say with absolute confidence that anyone with a truly open mind, could compare the religious undertones of this book with that of any religion or belief. The big question being asked is - if someone told you (and showed you) that everything you have been lead to belive up until this point in your life has been a misinterpretation of the truth, what would you do? This book explores and recounts the main character(Lestat)'s depiction of that journey. An imperfect tale that leads us everywhere  - from the US and abroad, even back and forward through space an time (from ancient Jerusalem to hell), all along weaving in all these characters and situations that seem (at times) irrelevant. From the haunting footsteps, the story of a missing eye, decapitation, laughter in heaven, to more hunting and killing in the night, which all takes place while giving us another fascinating vampiric tale  - the book makes for a pretty thrilling ride which eventually all makes sense as the story wraps around itself in the end to tie all the loose ends together. For all the flaws others have found in this book, Rice does a wickedly good job of getting you deeply entranced in a story that will have you questioning reality and your perception of what you know about your personal beliefs. If you love getting wrapped up in your imagination - this is a VERY good read.<br /><br />To everyone else who didn't like it, I feel bad that you misinterpreted the book. This book is about as far-feched as any an elderly man parting the Red sea and then thousands of people following him (for miles) to the other side - it's up for personal interpretation. There is no claim that this is a work of non-fiction (that has ever been proven as far as I'm aware of), so I can't understand why people are judging it as if it is. It does blur the line, and that's what makes it so interesting.piric tale  - the book makes for a pretty thrilling ride which eventually all makes sense as the story wraps around itself in the end to tie all the loose ends together.

B000EULJLU|5.0|For those of you who are too lazy to do any research, let me fill you in. I've read alot about how the song \\"10,000 Days\\" sounds like a filler, or that it's anti-climatic. Folks, this song is about the death of Maynard's mother. She had a stroke and suffered from complications for, you guessed it, 10,000 days (she passed in 2003). So these two songs (\\"Wings For Marie Pt.1 and 10,000 Days Pt. 2) are Maynard's way of expressing his sense of loss for his mother. I think the title of the album and song are very fitting. This whole album deals with loss on several different levels. Tool's music has far more depth and meaning than most people realize or will admit. Do yourself a favor and really listen to the lyrics on this album and open up your mind. I guarantee you're opinion will change for the better. This is an amazing album from start to finish. If you like music that is also thought provoking, you need to pick up this album.
0930289234|5.0|This book has changed the way we think about \\"super heroes.\\" The word had always meant someone like superman.  He was supremely strong, smart, and righteous.  Alan Moore, however, has created, instead of paradigms, people.  These people are full of faults.  Even those who try to do good end up finding those shades of gray that tend to cloud the real world.  The very idea of a superhero is one who takes it upon him/herself to help others one way or another.  Moore reminds us that it's not that easy.  When one becomes a vigilante one can easily do more damage than good.  In the end, this book is a great story that reminds us that the graphic novel form is literature and not just fluff.  And this book is a work of art.
B00005JMUA|5.0|You know how some action movies you'd watch and because you know whats going to happen you get a little turned away? This isn't one of those. I've watched this film so many times and I still can't get enough. Besides the whole thing of Uma looking really hot, (and I don't even like blondes)she just does her damn thing in this movie. You have to have this in your collection!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Best movie of the year, if you cry during these bring your tissue... this one hits you hard in the nose with a dose of bad things happen to good people. Man, not sure I could have handled that type of life, but it seems that people can and do. I loved it and the acting was of the highest level - kudos and mucho props to Will and his biological prodigy.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is the penultimate nature documentary series.  Whether the shallow seas, deep oceans, great plains or tropical rainforests, \\"Planet Earth\\" takes painstaking care to catalog the many forms of life on our planet.  I can't begin to imagine the level of patience required by these photographers to have actually captured the footage they did.  Watching the first ever snow leopard hunt caught on camera, the mating dance of the bird of paradise or the stunning pallet of colors of an Indonesian coral reef; I just can't over sell this series.      I purchased an hd-dvd player after being mesmerized by this series on Discovery HD; with the sole intent to buy this series.  The difference between the 1080i digital cable and the 1080p hd-dvd is readily apparent to even modest home theater enthusiasts.
B000063DFQ|5.0|The first time I'd heard Iron Maiden was recently, in Guitar Hero II. I played \\"The Trooper\\" many times, and it immediately stood out as my favorite (along with \\"War Pigs\\"). I knew if I liked this, it would be a good idea to check out more Iron Maiden. So, I did. I purchased Piece of Mind as my first Maiden album, and it did not disappoint.      1. Where Eagles Dare- Great opener, nice drum work in the beginning, and a good guitar riff. 8.5/10    2. Revelations- Sounds like the others in the beginning, but clearly distinguishes itself shortly in with a great riff. 8.5/10    3. Flight of Icarus- Establishes itself early on as different from the others. Another very good one. 8/10    4. Die With Your Boots On- Others liked this one, but I always felt it was decent at best. Slightly different from the previous 3, but not in a good way. Just not as memorable, or classic as the others. 7/10    5. The Trooper- What I consider to be the best on the CD. The Trooper has it all: an amazing guitar part, great vocals, and all the rest. Now that I have the real thing, I realize that this is MUCH better than the terrible Guitar Hero II cover. 10/10    6. Still Life- A bit odd as it starts, with a backwards message occupying the first 11 seconds. It starts off slow (not necessarily a bad thing), and is definitely one of the quieter, slower songs on Piece of Mind. A good one though. 8/10    7. Quest for Fire- In my opinion, one of the more generic songs on here. Still not bad, just not great. 7/10    8. Sun and Steel- One of my favorites, but the shortest on the CD, at 3:26. 9/10    9. To Tame A Land- A nice riff and an overall good song. 8.5/10
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I'm used to seeing this dude making people including myself laugh at how silly he can act. In this movie all you want to do is shake your head in disbelief. All the barriers and stuff this guy goes through with his son right by his side makes you wonder like, \\"Man this aint no movie, this is a reflection of life truly is.\\" I'm giving this a five because I can't find any negatives. Oh and P.S. this definetly something you can watch with your lady.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|The Live Tracks are Awesome and so is the rest of the CD.DVD is Great,The footage of the making of Belladonna plus the DVD of the video's
074356619X|3.0|The message of the secret: Attracting and manifesting what you want out of life by positive thinking is important and good.  The DVD I found to be cheesy.  There is something about this whole thing that makes you feel a bit like you are being sold something or into some kind of culty world.  The problem I have with this type of thinking is that you really have no room ever for a negative thought about anything which may not be reasonable.  Sometimes some thing may just be bad and you need to change it.  Again, if this is the first time you have ever encountered this type of thinking than give it a good listen and you will grow a lot.  For others that have been living this way you may be a bit turned off by the presentation of The Secret.
1878424319|5.0|My dad sent me this book - thanks, dad.  Many other reviewers have elgantly summed up the premise better than I could, so I'll make one comment: The concept of 'It's not personal' has affected me deeply. The bad day of others, rudeness from a clerk, crazy drivers... it's not personal. It's been a very freeing concept for me, allowing me to move past things that otherwise might cloud my day.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The Italian Job is an awesome movie!  It's action-packed & is very clever.  I had a copy of the movie, but the disc got scratched, so I bought another copy to replace it.  It's one of the few movies you won't get tired of watching, even though you already know what's going to happen.
B0006B29WA|5.0|I'm likely giving an extra half-star due to bias, but really, this double-CD is a lot of fun. The bonus disc's full of songs that are easily as good as the main album and actually bring more of the band's personality into light. They take from many influences: one minute they sound like the Kinks (or the obvious Talking Heads tint), the next I'm hearing the Jewish folk song, \\"Hava Nagila\\"!    Yet what I find these guys do especially well is create an atmosphere. There's dark, flirtatious humor in Alex Kapranos's voice, and his writing is rather witty. They also know how to make each and every song catchy, and at once just far enough from the mainstream edge to be considered by music lovers of all kinds. So while this album isn't technically a masterpiece, I find it another in a line of those which respects music for what it is: an art form that represents the musician. You may not dig their sound, but at least it's authentic.    Highlights: The Dark of the Matinee, Come On Home, This Fffire.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|It's funny, warm, and completely kid-safe. It combines the best of \\"be yourself\\" messages, a little on the nerdy side, with every child's wish to have some scrap of control over the incomprehensible world of grownups. And of course, this movie stars some very sweet kids - Matilda's little friend Lavender (Kiami Davael) is about as cute as they ever get.<br /><br />I haven't read Roald Dahl's original story, [[ASIN:0141301066 Matilda]], so I don't know how faithful the adaptation has been. The worst this movie could be, though, is a charming story in itself. Matilda grows up, brings herself up really, in a family where watching TV is almost a holy ritual, and where Daddy Wormwood (Danny DeVito) teaches that any scam is OK, as long as it makes a buck and you don't get caught. Despite the Wormwood family's best efforts, Matilda develops a strong sense of the right thing to do and a voracious love of reading. And, as the tensions build and the grownups become more outrageous, she develops a little bit of magic, too.<br /><br />This certainly deserves a place in your rainy-day library. Your child is sure to enjoy it, almost as much as your inner child does.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000PY52EU|5.0|I received this movie yesterday and watched it last night. First, let me start by saying, in my opinion, the title does not do justice to this movie. This movie is much, much better than the title implies. What can you say about Samuel L. Jackson, except he is brilliant and it shows in this movie. Not only did he do his own singing, as a guitar player myself, I am reasonably sure he did his own playing. He has already established himself as a very competent actor and this just put the icing on the cake. As for Christina Ricci, I have seen her in a few films and thought she did well, although Buffalo '66 was not a good choice for her. She was the best thing about that movie. Yeah, you get to see alot of Christina and she has come a long way from the Addams family movies. This is by far the best role I've seen her in and she took it to the max. I look forward to seeing her in more good roles in the future. If anyone has any doubt as to Justin Timberlake's transition from singer to acting, you can put those doubts aside. He showed that he was quite capable of handling a role. If he picks his roles carefully, I see a great future in acting for him. The Director was also the writer and what a story he told. There are some that would probably be put off by the racial aspects of the movie and that was part of the underlying story. This film deserved a better reception at the box office than what it apprantly received. It only played here for maybe two weeks. Again, I think the title probably hurt the film and the fact there was very little promo if any. This movie is well worth buying. Charlie S. Richmond Va.
B00008DDXB|5.0|Unfortunately I ordered a book not a movie, but I take full credit for the mistake.  I have this movie as I have all the ones out so far and it like the rest is up to the quality I expected from any Harry Potter product.  PG 13 is a good rating as I dont think that younger children should see the violence within the Chamber itself, mostly they wouldnt understand what was happening. I would recomend this to all interested in the mystery and fantasy of fiction.

B00008NG5V|2.0|This guy is way overhyped, songwriting is whiny and lacks any facts or knowledge.  Guitar playing is really childish skittishes that do not really portray any talent past knowing 3 chords.  Tries to act like he is some voice that represents youth but fails miserably.  I added this CD to my list of things I wipe with.  If you really want to hear an acoustical session that proves this guy sux, there are some others out there.  Marketing is the key in todays music world instead of talent and that is why this guy sells records.  The lyrics suk, he is just crying and whining from visuals he gets from NPR or something, and that alone is enough to put someone to sleep.  Boring, bad and will not be heard of in twenty years.  I wish the next Hendrix or Neil Young would please stand up because the posers in here right now annoy me.
0618680004|5.0|I dare you to read this book if you think \\"faith\\" is a principle to live by.  Humans dragged themselves out of the muck by testing hypotheses (does this kind of rock make good tools; what happens if I stick this meat in the fire; are all mushroom equally safe to eat?).  If you think faith, rather than science is \\"the light and the way\\", then stay off airplanes (Bernoulli's Principle; what's that??), scrap your car and start walking---oh yes, and start hunting your own food.  Given that you are already a de facto scientist it would make sense to pay attention to Dawkins' arguments.
0307237699|1.0|Seriously people this guy is just as big a tool as the other ones in there.  They all lie and they all lie some more.  Oh sure let me hear it oh yes Bush is terrible so anything is better..well what we really need are some progressive thinkers, what we need is a revolution!  Obama smiles nice and waves like a 1999 jet comber but in reality he is already showing more extreme and bizarre actions on what he would do than Bush has, or Clinton before him!  I am very scared of this guy so I was really wanting this book to open my eyes to a part of him I did not know.  Instead it was like an advertisement pamphlet for his bid for president.  Very, very disappointing, and I am more impressed with Howard Dean than I am with this guy or Billy C's wife.  We need better insight when it comes to the coverage of these people and where they stand long before the day of voting comes around.  I don't know who is scarier though, him or that Nola Mayor Nagin man that guy is really scaring me.      A better book is [[ASIN:0641572409 Citizen McCain]] if you want someone who is a bit more honest in presenting their life story.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|... although it does have its moments, especially with \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" - that one's a grand slam home run that's guaranteed to be a live performance favourite when MB hits the road on tour.    On the flip side, his remake of \\"That's Life\\" is a clunker that could have been a smash with a punchier arrangement putting the emphasis on the horn section - the gospel-influenced approach was simply a badly-concocted idea (heck, even David Lee Roth, of all people, did a better version).    But I've noticed that about Michael Buble; his remakes are either fantastic or outright throw-aways.  So far, \\"It's Time\\" represents the apex of his career.

B000R8YC3G|5.0|How's this for a slice of fried gold...Shaun of the Dead is a fantastic movie and one of my favorite films of all time. All that can be said about it has been said by other reviewers. Having seen it countless times on standard DVD I was looking forward to the HD DVD. I have to say I was blown away. It really has the same extras as the standard DVD but the video quality is far superior. The sharpness and colors really pop for a low budget movie. To be honest there are a few dark scenes that have some grain but this is due to the films low budget origins. For $20 this HD-DVD is a must have for Shaun fans and is a fantastic upgrade. If you love dry British humor, this is for you.  I have shown this to as many people as I can and will continue to do so.     As my wife says, \\"If we can bring Shaun of the Dead to one person, then we've done something good\\".    Spread the word of \\"Shaun\\"
B000OCXMAE|2.0|When I first saw that Linkin Park had a new album, I was psyched to get the copy.  I bought it at a Target (which only sold it coupled with one of their books) for over $20!!  I played it about 3 times and can honestly say if you like the traditional Linkin Park, then you may find 1-2 songs worth while.  Other than that, it was like listening to a band that once ruled the metal world for 25 years and now they wanted to do a \\"personal\\" album.  However, these guys have not been around long enough to claim this type of work.  If I could return used CDs, I would have.  Not a good buy, save your money for a 1995 Led Zeppelin album.

B000OQF6N6|3.0|The Pumpkins' Zeitgeist just ain't all that. It's minimally interesting and randomly brilliant. It's poorly produced. It's still a different sort of spoonful from the bucket of rock 'n roll, but it's missing something.<br /><br />On Billy:<br /><br />I'll say that there are chords that only Billy Corgan knows how to play. The ethereal beauty of his wild soloing has always struck me, and he is, I think, a pureblood wildchild of guitar, divinely blessed, at times revolutionary. And insurrection is what Billy demands with song titles like the ball-fisted \\"United States\\" and the faithfully inspired \\"Bring the Light.\\" But what's posing as aggression on Zeitgeist is merely an over-admission of free-flying distortion. The more effective rock n' roll snarling of the Pumpkin's debut Gish comes with fast, muted machinegun strumming (i.e. \\"Tristessa\\"), tripped-out, watery, slithering snakecharmer-riffs (i.e. \\"Rhinoceros\\"), and brazen sonic shifts (i.e. \\"Window Paine\\"). And on Siamese Dream, Billy's guitar crunches and grinds with a more focused, upfront attack. On Zeitgeist, there is a welcome return to spontaneous soloing and more wandering melodies, but these recalls are often stunted by generally restrictive song structures, and echoey distortion that disseminates and thins out like feathers being sucked into a fan on the ceiling of a barren, steel warehouse. All being said, the brief, searing solo in \\"Bring the Light\\" is one of the greatest, artful, and most elevating moments to have ever occurred in rock. Unfortunately, the overwhelming brilliant and emotive soloes of \\"Soma\\", \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\", \\"Quiet\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"Geek U.S.A.\\", \\"Hummer\\", \\"Here is No Why\\", etc., are absent here, and arguably have been since Machina. In regards to Billy's vocals, I've thought it was a mistake, since Mellon Collie, not to adorn his voice with at least some presence of softening phasers, ala Siamese Dream days, to give depth and a cosmic layer to his undeniably trebly tenor. The Queen-esque multiple layering of Billy's vocals on Zeitgeist is interesting and at times dramatic, but overall his voice comes off weak, and overbearingly dry and thin.<br /><br />On Jimmy:<br /><br />While his signature style continues to relay off an explosive, papery snare drum, jazzily bright toms, celestially sparkling crashes, sizzling chinas and a fast, airy ride cymbal, Jimmy's just no longer an innovative drummer, and really hasn't been since Machina. It's the same formula, over and over, song after song. He submits compulsively to whipping the hi-hat to add a jazzy punch and hardly ever varies from his four-four clicking of the hats in keeping time; the hats are hardly used at all except for riding, snapping and as a clapping metronome. Furthermore, he rarely rides his hats with variety, only using them for rattling or tight-clamped tapping. On the same note, Jimmy's violent, marching pounding of crashes on \\"Starz\\" is emotional and bold and has an imminent effect, but there are segments throughout the album of Billy's driving, cutting strumming that could have possibly been more powerfully layered with a sharp, aggressive and perpetual waving of cymbals (such as on \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)), instead of his typically frequent, focused attacking. Jimmy's tribal skills and athletic endurance on \\"United States\\" is reverential, but overall the song itself doesn't afford him the opportunity to really jump off into the stratosphere in the way \\"Silverf*ck\\" allowed. Chamberlin's most engaging and original playing presents itself in his diesel-fueled snare drum rolls and rim-shotting, but too often does he resort to tapping a double hit before bar changes and during verses rarely strays from ordinary rock layering with the snare on 2 and 4.<br /><br />Overall, Zeitgeist's strongest tracks include \\"7 Shades of Black\\", which contains particularly creative innovations of structure and dirty grooving, \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\", whose plasmic chords recall the overcast thickness ofAdore's sound and exhibits Billy's exceptionally spacey talents, \\"Starz\\", whose punchy blasts harken back to the solar flares of \\"Rocket\\" days, of course \\"Tarantula\\", which carries the sexy swinging energy of a glorified Thin Lizzy (with it's middle finger boldly jamming up the face of pitiful terrestrial radio), and \\"Bring the Light\\", whose ambition and electricity is moving. \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" should have opened the album, successfully levitating the record into the stratosphere with a fragile, patient, and graceful beauty once witnessed on Adore's \\"To Sheila\\", \\"Once Upon a Time\\", \\"Behold! the Nightmare\\", and especially \\"Blank Page\\".<br /><br />\\"Doomsday Clock\\" is much too bland of a song to have been chosen for radio (or an album for that matter) or as the opener to Zeitgeist. I honestly cannot understand it's popularity. While \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" produces pretty chords, it does not have enough rock n' roll meat to justify the Pumpkin history, and is rather tiresome just at the midmark, coming off like a decaffeinated track from the Zwan album, while also suffering the most from the aforementioned weaknesses in Corgan's voice and Chamberlin's performance (Jimmy eventually sounds as if he's just mechanically and randomly hitting his drums and cymbals as he waits for the final bars of the song to arrive). \\"United States\\" implies giant potential in its percussionistic width and hungry trajectory, but ultimately the song cannot stand up to the dynamic, acid trip marathon of the sensual and hyper-kinetic \\"Silverf*ck\\". Musically, \\"Neverlost\\"'s xylophones hop over colorful roadways like strange bunnies under purple skies, but Billy's constrictive vocals cannot compliment the song's liquidy wanderlust. The riff of \\"(Come On) Let's Go\\" remembers the knife-sharp scraping of \\"Zero\\" but is just not memorable. \\"For God and Country\\" might've made a good mood piece for the soundtrack of a science fiction metropolis setting, but only without the overshooting vocal strains. And as for \\"Zeitgeist\\", the closing acoustic commentary of a people who need to take part in some kind of implied political and spiritual revolution, the song is like a throw-away track from The Aeroplane Flies High's gentle and beautiful \\"Tonight Tonight\\" single (hear \\"Meladori Magpie\\").<br /><br />In hindsight what's most disappointing about Zeitgeist is its marketing. I believe there are 4 editions at this point (including the silver limited release). 4! All to add just a few songs collectively? Zeitgeist was not good enough for ONE special edition. Why not a B-Side album?<br /><br />Oh whatever. Whatever! God bless the Pumpkins of before.<br /><br />In the end, I could never trade my ongoing love affairs with Gish, Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, Mellon Collie, Adore and all the little singles and on and on and on for all the riches in the world. But the days of the Pumpkins are long gone. You cannot duplicate all of that majesty; and even if you could, it wouldn't mean the same thing today.exceptionally spacey talents, \\"Starz\\", whose punchy blasts harken back to the solar flares of \\"Rocket\\" days, of course \\"Tarantula\\", which carries the sexy swinging energy of a glorified Thin Lizzy (with it's middle finger boldly jamming up the face of pitiful terrestrial radio), and \\"Bring the Light\\", whose ambition and electricity is moving. \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" should have opened the album, successfully levitating the record into the stratosphere with a fragile, patient, and graceful beauty once witnessed on Adore's \\"To Sheila\\", \\"Once Upon a Time\\", \\"Behold! the Nightmare\\", and especially \\"Blank Page\\".     \\"Doomsday Clock\\" is much too bland of a song to have been chosen for radio (or an album for that matter) or as the opener to Zeitgeist.

B000ESST6U|5.0|I will admit that baroque music is not one of my favorite.  However, I'm quite attached my DVD's of Handel opera's from Munich productions, quirky though they be.  But this one goes to the very top of the list by a mile.  I won't repeat all the plaudits from others except to say that if you only buy one Handel opera on DVD, it should be this one.  It's 5+ stars regardless of what aspect you talking about.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|Finally time to review this album after giving it a week of listening.  Obviously, I was super stoked when this came out.  Certainly one of my favorite bands, Sum 41 is on that short list of bands that got better as they got harder.  Here, it isn't quite as hard as some of their other stuff, but still very enjoyable none the less.  They still have the ripping fast choruses which I love.  The ballad \\"Without you\\" is nothing short of amazing.  I heard it was way too poppy at first but that itsn't entirely true. Sum 41 still rule the music world in my books
630522577X|5.0|Excellent cast and wonderful music make this superb movie one of the best of all time.  The Oh so true play based on the English social class distinction, as it used to be, and scenes and characters in Covent Garden just add richness to the whole story.    Featuring the characters from the Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, of former times, together with the opera goers from the Covent Garden Opera House adds highlight to the cultural extreams that existed, \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" for so long.     The truly beautiful Audry Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway, Wilfred Hyde-White, Gladys Cooper and company, give us the richness and romanticism of a bygone era.......just wonderful.
B000RJO578|1.0|This film was rated 5.5 stars.  I don't know how anyone can find this film hysterical.  There were only a few moments where there was any hint that this movie was a comedy.  This is one of the dummest movies I have ever watched.  I don't think this \\"comedy\\" even deserves one star, maybe a minus 5 stars.
B000MZHW1S|5.0|THERE IS NOTHING FALSE ABOUT THIS MOVIE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE EVEN THAT THIS MOVIE IS POINTING OUT HAPPEN IN REAL LIVE AND I'M A LIVING WITNESS. THE COUNTRY THEY USED IN THIS MOVIE SHARE BORDER WITH MY COUNTRY. THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF MY COUNTRY HELP TO DESTROYED INOCENT LIVES OF THIS COUNTRY ALL BECAUSE OF DIAMOND. I CAN'T SAY MORE. JUST BUY THE MOVIE AND SEE REAL HISTORY FOR YOURSELF THAN YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
B00005JN0T|1.0|Could have been a very good movie were it not for Will Smith's predictable performance. Come to think of it so was Independence Day. I find myself bored to tears watching this guy and his predictable hatred for robots or love interest stuff. Hard to sit through it waiting for the good stuff. His stuff is strictly canned.     I can't imagine any director with brains wanting him for a lead so one can make an educated guess that there was a deal involved. That gives the actor power to alter his part. In Smith's case my guess is his performance kept a constant eye on what the characters actions would mean to Will Smith's career and not what it would mean to the movie. In fact that seems always to be the case.    The hatred of robots bit is so contrived its brain numbing.    Note who takes up 90% of the cover.

0440418569|1.0|It's been years ago that I read this trilogy, but the intense disappointment of the third book has stayed with me over the years to the point that I am writing my first review here ever.  With all the years that have passed, I don't remember all the details of book three, but I still, at this point in time, remember how I felt.<br /><br />(I'm writing at this late date because the last book of the Harry Potter series has just come out and has made me think about endings of other series I have read, and this came to mind immediately.)<br /><br />I read the first two books in this trilogy, and I could not put them down.  I neglected things I should be doing, because I could not stop reading - stayed up all night reading one of them.  When I was not reading them, I still felt as if I was inhabiting that world.<br /><br />As soon as I finished one book I immediately needed to get my hands on the next one.  With books one and two I literally felt transported to another world, one that was very compelling and well-crafted.  I was very excited to find this trilogy because it contained such unique ideas and truly transported me to another place.  I HIGHLY recommend the first two books.  (The only problem with doing so is that they compel you to keep going, and then the third is such a let-down.)<br /><br />I am a Christian and appreciate being challenged about my faith - to entertain other points of view and to wrestle with them, to be challenged to think deeply.  I love to ask \\"what if\\" questions. I certainly had no problem with the books from that aspect.<br /><br />My disappointment was that this trilogy seemed to be building and building in a compelling and incredible way, and I could not wait to find out what this was all heading towards.  Given such an auspicious beginning, I thought the climax would just be astounding.  Not only was it not astounding, but I couldn't even figure out what it was.  It's like it ended with no climax at all.<br /><br />I felt as I read the third book that there was to be a new order, a new chance for the human race to face once more the choice made in the Garden of Eden.  I was eager to see what that choice would be and what the outcome would be.<br /><br />I reached the end of book three and felt like I had fallen off a cliff and into a vacuum.  After all the build-up, I could not even figure out what the temptation or choice was - or if it had been made at all, and, if so, what the outcome was.<br /><br />I invested all this enthusiasm and all this time, and I got to the long-anticipated end, and all I could say was, \\"What?  Did I miss something?  Was it just not there?  Is it just cluelessness on my part that I missed some subtlety?  What was THE significant choice?  What was the outcome?  What were the consequences of the choice?\\"  It just didn't feel good at all, and I'm left feeling like I set out on this AMAZING unique journey that drew me in so deeply and compellingly (in books one and two), and then in book three it all kind of fizzled out with no real climax or fulfillment.<br /><br />If somebody can explain to me what it is I missed I really would appreciate it.  What was the choice?  What impact did it have?  Did it follow naturally from the first two books, and I just missed it?<br /><br />Since I deeply loved the first two books, I'd love to find a way to enjoy the third as well.<br /><br />The thought has crossed my mind to read it again, because maybe I just didn't catch on, but I don't feel like I want to invest the time.r, a new chance for the human race to face once more the choice made in the Garden of Eden.

B000EULJLU|3.0|IT SOUNDS MUCH LIKE THE LAST CD.   IT IS GOOD TO LISTEN TO ,BUT, SOME OF THE SAME GUITAR LICKS AS BEFORE.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Intense,captivating and intriguing, this movie was an unexpected delight.  Each coincidence,new name, urgent letter to the editor requires total concentration as you try to piece the puzzle together with the fabulous crew of this movie. In their frantic and all consuming efforts to catch this deranged killer, each of the lives of the main characters changes simultaneously as they are consumed by this horror.    The casting was brilliant, the actors intriguing, particularly Robert Downey and Jake Gyllenhaal. Do not hesitate to add this movie for your collection.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is MY \\"Sgt. Peppers!\\" It flows so beautifully and tells such a great story. It evokes incredible emotions with the songwriting and lyrics and has stunning textures throughout.
B00005JXY3|4.0|This is a pretty good sequel! It doesn't quite have the magic of the first film, but it does have a beautiful new setting in Okinawa. Macchio and Morita are great again in this \\"Rocky\\" type underdog movie. Like \\"Rocky\\" the sequels are kind of formula, but very watchable 3 1/2 stars!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly is such a talented and beautiful girl.  This album is good, but not her best.  I think she sounds like she is screaming alot and many of the songs sound the same.  It's a sad album - maybe she needed to get some things off her mind?
B000QUCNOU|3.0|Acting was great in this movie. I love the way they accurately portrayed the era, but the movie was just too slow moving.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|The first few tracks are great.  Kelly is trying new things but it still is classic Kelly.  The songs get weaker though towards the end.  Still good songs but not her best stuff.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Not a whole lot to say about this movie--other than there is nothing more visually impressive, emotionally stunning and legendary in violence and Historical RECREATION than this movie about the battle of Thermopylae. By far Gerard Butler's best movie, it is well known this is also a  fictitious graphic-comic adaptation so there is a whole lot of Hollywood license being taken, but i think it is still one of the best Epics of all time and one of the best movies I've seen since Gladiator.
B00006ALA8|2.0|Empire was probably re mixed by the musicians with ther damaged earing, so the midband and hi frequency are on the brighter side of reality and became verry agressive at high volume.  Silent lucidity is a good example with is harsh trebble.  The cd format sound much more analog than the 24/96 dvd audio but the midband frequency is more darker (and much more listenable).  The old cd format is more pleasing to lisen to and much well recorded than the new dvd audio mix.  The problem was (i think) the re-egalisation of all the songs, not the dvd audio format.    sebastrophile
B00003CWL6|5.0|Suburban angst turns funny then tragic. We should all reach the spiritual level Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham reaches in his last hours.   The kid with the video camera becomes a surprising focal point thanks to a superb acting performance by Wes Bentley. The kid and his recording of the floating plastic bag hold the key to the spiritual treasure of \\"American Beauty.\\"  This first-time collaboration of director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball is a prime example of what Hollywood could deliver more of if the studio executives ever got their heads out of the sequels and the comic books. I'm convinced there are other fine scripts floating around waiting for the will and the daring to produce them.
0823013626|5.0|This book is more like a \\"Polymer Clay Bible\\".  I've been working with Polymer Clay for 2-3 years and have several books.  This one is by far the best I've read.  There are so many techniques that were new to me and her explanations are so thorough.  The step-by-step pictures are beautiful and all of my questions were answered.  The tools, cutters, paints, clays, etc. she uses are all identified and easily obtainable. The pictures of her amazing art and those of many other artists are beautiful and so inspiring.  This is definitely a book that every PC enthusiast will want in their library. It's one you will refer to over and over again for both inspiration and pleasure.

B00005JODK|5.0|Well we went to see the movie and wow!The music the acting was just pure fun.There are no car chases or any major violence.The movie is funny and witty and reminds me of the good old days with Shindig and American Bandstand,when life was a litle less complicated.A real winner and i recommend this to your whole family.I Thank You for Reading My Review.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|Bought The Shooter hoping it would rival the action and intelligence of the Bourne movies.  Sad to say, it missed that mark (which is admittedly very high) by a good bit.  The action is episodic, and indeed the pace comes to a near halt on several occassions. And by the end the good guy proves himself to be no better, morally or otherwise, than the bad guys.  Rent it if you like, but you might think twice before shelling out your hard earned dollars to buy what amounts to a mediocre pic.
B000FA57N0|5.0|As a sci fi fan I enjoyed this film and in Hi Def it was even better.<br />Joss Whedon has a nack for telling a story and making you care for the characters.<br />It picks up after the Firefly Series and continues the story of the bounty hunter after River and her Brother.<br />The film is rich with wit, humor and adventure. 5 Stars from me.<br />I cam only hope Firefly will follow in HD DVD soon.
B000BYRCR4|4.0|This is not a horror movie.  This film does not compare well with horror movies.  This is an action movie with zombies.  It compares very well with other action movies.  Starting where Resident Evil ended, the bullets start flying and the zombies start chomping immediately (do watch RE before this one).  Although the script is hardly award winning, the movie delivers much more than you would reasonably expect from a video game based zombie movie.  The actors are capable enough, and even if you find them stiff and generic, it's okay - most of them don't survive very long.  Sadly, the comedy relief guy isn't funny at all and he does survive the whole movie.  Also, the martial arts and special effects are good overall (except for the CGI Dobermans which are awful).  Somehow the film avoids being predictable and sets up the last part of the trilogy nicely.  Whether or not you've played the video game (I haven't), Resident Evil: Apocalypse is sure to satisfy cravings for a fast-paced action movie with sexy, gun-toting, butt-kicking babes if you can forgive a few rather forced script elements (like main characters strolling through a graveyard totally oblivious to the risk this involves during a zombie uprising!)
B000E1MTY0|5.0|The best Batman.<br />No campy or goofy lines here. it's a more realistic film with plenty of action and adventure.<br />The characters are stronger here than in the earlier films.<br />Great film if you like Batman.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is hysterical. I bought it for my sons 13th birthday because they had all caught it on TV a dozen or more times. He and his friends,both girls and boys,quote it and think it is the funniest thing. It is no braniac of a fim but if you are looking to escape and watch something fun and silly this is it.
1401211909|5.0|Once again Mr. Gaiman has scored a favored place in my personal library. 'Stardust' is an enchanting can't-put-down Fairy Tale that is sure to delight you!, It did me!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|A pleasure to watch.  It shows that with talent, emotional and mental stamina, even a woman can get what she wants and where she wants to go.  Beatrix rejected the men her parents chose for her, persisted in her drawings and writings even though her parents thought this activity only fit for a child, and she has become eternal through her works.     As with all true stories, there was plenty of heartache, but she persevered and developed success in her life, despite the prejudices and hypocrisy of Victorian and Edwardian England, where women of substantial means were either married, or nothing.  I would hope that this movie represented her actual life because it would be so satisfying to think of her as she was presented.
0743455967|5.0|Whether you are writing papers for school or writing to be published, this book is a must read.  Stephen King offers practical advice and writes as if he is in a private conversation with you.<br /><br />I've noticed a difference in my writing already and I thank Stephen King for his excellent book about writing.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|i thought this would be bad. desperate for entertainment, i rented it and laughed like crazy. a few serious moments but mostly either funny or really engrossing. characters fascinating to me. now am going to buy it, can't really live without it...
B00005JODK|5.0|Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a bubbly, bouncy, chubby girl who's a great dancer.  Her dream is to be a regular on the Corny Collins dance party show, like her secret crush Link (Zac Efron) and the most popular girl at school, Amber.  Amber's mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is station manager, however, and she not only rejects Tracy because of her weight, she bans black dancers from the show except for one day a month.  With the help of her friends and parents (John Travolta, Christopher Walken),  Tracy not only becomes a dancing star on the show, she opens it up to all races.<br /><br />This is one feel-good movie, with energetic song and dance numbers every few minutes that will absolutely have you smiling and tapping your toes.  I soon forgot about Travolta playing Tracy's mother and just enjoyed the performance, which is very good.  Nikki Blonsky is adorable and does a spectacular job in her first movie; Pfeiffer is convincing in the unsympathetic role of a bigot.  Christopher Walken is a joy to watch as always, totally charismatic and loveable as the eccentric dad.  This movie is a lot like [[ASIN:B00006B1HH Grease]] but much more wholesome and positive.  It's a happy, family film with lots of catchy tunes and talented actors.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|If your like me you appreciate great horror movies and understand that there are very few really great horror movies made. Well, this is one of them. It exudes the creepy atmospheric quality that is so elusive for directors and writers to capture. It is also surreal without being confusing. The ominous music score is nearly as perfect as John Carpenter's Halloween score and the Tallman is one of the best horror villians of the last 30 years...
B000002KNI|5.0|I was far too young to have gone to the concert itself, but I'm glad I got to hear the recording. Along with the usual S&G tunes, they also did some of their solo stuff (Paul Simon's \\"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\\" with Garfunkel on Harmony, and Art Garfunkel's \\"A Heart in New York\\") and a remake (Wake Up Little Susie). It's a shame they haven't gotten back together in years, but such is the fate of groups that split up. I highly recommend this recording. The sound quality's great and you'll love the tunes.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|I thought this was the best of and several songs I did not know and frankly did not like.  I am sorry to say I was very disappointed.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|the fact that the i am able to contribute to the cause is already worth every penny.  with the added bonus of being able to watch the concert that nobody would think of being able to watch again.  i've watched the concert when i was 13 yrs old in the philippines.   the quality is not really good, but hey, that was the 80's!  some performance are not included but it was explained in the book.  and count ourselves lucky that we are still able to have 4 discs!!! it's like owning part of history that won't happen again.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|The first time I heard Evanescence I thought 'Cool rock chick making it Linkin Park style'. But after I heard her first album I just saw that Evanescence may be called similar, but just the song Bring me to Life. Each and every song on their previous album is amazing, and the lyrics are just great.     Having that in mind I bought the album as soon as it got in Amazon for sale. What was my surprise when I found that every single attractive quality Evanescence added to Goth Metal was long gone, no more cool songs. The best songs in the album are Lythium and Call me when you're sober. But hey! What happened to the great lyric writting?. The other songs are just about deppresion and sadness, nothing new, no new perspective. Amy Lee is still what makes Evanescence speacial, but she definetly needs a new Metal rocker to help her to take her back on track.      You will like this album if you enjoy the band's singles or if you are a die-hard fan of Evanescence. Otherwise if you wish to listen to Evanesence music try the previous album. Again, a sad chapter in Metal History.
1594489505|5.0|The second book by this author is fully as well conceived and written as his first \\"The Kite Runner\\".  I knew little of Afganistan and its history and the pain brought to its people by the different rulers after the deposition of the Shah.  It held my interest from first page to last.  I judge a book by whether I would read it again.  I would and I will.
B000H305U0|3.0|The first time I heard SexyBack I thought Justin's new album would be filled with lots of great new tracks, and as always he'd take a different direction in Pop to sound fresh and hip.     He kind of tried to do that, but if you got just one and only main producer (Timbaland) you get one and only result: All the songs sound exactly the same. The dance songs have pretty much no difference between them, the lyrics quality is worst than his previous album, and though some songs sound refreshing, the rest of them are disposable. This album is filled with 5 good songs and the rest is nothing more than fillers.    This is sad considering that he is pretty much the dominating alfa male in Pop right now. But it's not as good as his previous album. Some mention some Prince like style, but Justin is far far away from sounding like any Prince album, he's got the ideas, a great Producer (Timbaland), but he needs a little bit more of different ideas. Not just the same idea for all the songs in an album.    This is kind of the same for Justin as Bad was for Michael Jackson, lots of keyboards, lots of beatboxing, and lots of dance songs, but just like 'Bad', it wasn't half as good as 'Thriller'. Sad story.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Theatrical edits happen all the time, the result often being that we feel a little lost. The story might make an abrupt jump from scene A to scene D, skipping B and C because those scenes just didn't make it into the time budget.<br /><br />In most cases, I wait to buy the extended version or Director's Cut for that very reason. In this case, though, I'm glad I bought both. Together, they let me see what I believe is the most masterful theatrical edit ever done.<br /><br />When you watch the Director's Cut, you'll discover a story arc completely left out in the [[ASIN:B000AARKOO theatrical release]]. It's not a trivial, throwaway story, either. It's absolutely critical to understanding the context and motivation for Guy de Lusignan's machinations and his obsession with marrying Sibylla.<br /><br />That the story fell out in the edits does not surprise me. I am awed, though, by how surgically Scott handled things without leaving a glaring hole in the film. He stitched together dialogue, scenes, and transitions seamlessly, removing a line's original meaning while twisting it in the edit, bridging a gap so solidly that you don't notice its absence.<br /><br />Even -after- watching the Director's Cut, I go back to the theatrical release and see it as its own movie, not just an incomplete, botched studio edit.<br /><br />If you are only willing to buy one copy of this movie, buy the Director's Cut, by all means. It is worth every dime, and then some. If you're a student of film (amateur or professional, either one,) then I -urge- you to buy both and study them as an exemplar of the \\"graceful degradation\\" concept applied to cinema.

1400034779|5.0|After reading the first chapter I thought what a delightful, but simply written, little book.  Then it began to take on more complexities, a fleshing out of characters, and kept me well entertained to the end.<br />This story takes place in Botswana, Africa.  After Mma Ramotswe's father died, she used the proceeds from the sale of his estate of 180 head of cattle to open a detective agency.  Although she had no training in this field she had lots of common sense and could bring about satisfactory closures to the various problems.  This is a book to read over and over.  But, the author wrote five more books that follow this one and I look forward to also reading those.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I first saw this DVD in part at Best Buy in the TV section and thought--\\"who is this guy? I love it!\\" So after buying his newest CD there was still a missing component for me.  This DVD will make you twice the MB fan--he's so fun to watch and then when you listen to the included CD of the live performances you are brought right back to the stage and his wonderful voice.  It is a great buy--you won't be disappointed!

1933784032|3.0|The actual content of the book is top notch, with many great shots model shots.  I also enjoy the accompanying stories, from behind the scenes.  The problem is, the binding was already coming apart when I received it.  A beautiful book, marred by a crappy binding.    I received a copy of this book as a present, that was purchased on Amazon.
0790729342|5.0|Hehehe I knew you could;-)  Mad Max, when it came out in the states was seen as a post-nuclear war vision.  One where the US and Russia wipe each other out, but the rest of the world just faces the economic collapse that the two superpowers war causes.  The Australian perspective was more to do with the energy crunch of the Opec embargo, one that hit Australia very hard.  Mad Max is more of a 'peak oil' series than a 'post nuclear' series.    And we are facing the beginnings of that dark future now.  It could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow.  Once the fuel prices spike high and stay that way, the panic it will cause will alone be enough to disrupt, possibly destroy civilization.    This is a movie that we should put back in theaters.  Like the budget theaters that some cities/towns have.  People will come for the action and Mel Gibson, then they'll remember the beginning and the end of this movie, the narrative.
0060763892|1.0|I'm not sure which is worse, this book, or the fact that it's getting positive reviews on Amazon.com. This novel is a nonsensical, ill-written mish-mash of the worst b-movie stereotypes. It has rogue government agents, exotic locations, devious turncoats, an omnipotent evil organization, and, let's see, what else? Oh yeah, a deadly evil virus that threatens to wipe out the world. Ohh, scary. It's like the author went to the airport bookshelf, took one element from every bad King, Koontz and Chrichton novel and bound it together with a plot he pulled out of Tom Clancy's garbage can. I'd also have to guess that the villanous secret organization, The Guild (ohh, great name), was based on a cross between Inspector Gadget's M.A.D. and G.I. Joe's COBRA. Unfortunately, the cartoon villains end up being more realistic and scary than Rollins's horrendously written bad guys.     This is the worst sort of light reading because in addition to being poorly written, stupid and cliche', it's also dim witted. Avoid at all costs, there are plenty of well written thrillers.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|Nemesis may be the most mature of the many Star Trek movies. Maybe that's why so many fans dislike it; but, if so, that's a terrible disappointment. Star Trek has always been as much about great ideas as about futuristic technology, explosions, and trysts with exotic aliens.<br /><br />Nemesis is the complete package: a movie about great ideas--humanity, identity, and the freedom to choose--that is also action-packed. Better still, the audience is left to think about those ideas for themselves while the sermonizing is kept to a minimum and the crew gets on with blowing things up.<br /><br />Take a look at the deleted scenes on the DVD to see exactly how this was made into a good movie instead of a tired rehash: several scenes that would have slowed the pace while the characters pontificated about the obvious were whittled away. Unfortunately, a charming alternate ending with some Trek in-jokes was also cut. Leaving it out did make a better movie, but don't miss the funny bit about the seat belt--at last! Nemesis may not be the very best of the Star Trek movies, but I'm sorry I missed it in the theater.
B000RJO578|5.0|One of the most enjoyable movies I've ever experienced,...funny from the opening scene, and the pace of the jokes just keep on coming faster and faster.  I have NEVER laughed harder or longer in a movie theatre.  The GUNS, the BLOOD, the GORE,...I was on the floor,...and I'm Canadian?!.  I watched this film again last night on DVD, again, hilarious. So many in- jokes and action I will need my own copy for the many reviews.    Also,a beautifully filmed movie.    Full credit to the production team for putting all the peices together so seemlessly.      Cheers.
1594489505|3.0|I liked the Kite Runner better for only one reason. Khaled's vivd heartbreaking anatomy of childhood is excellent and the tale's twist are mostly weeker than his caracters. Only in A Thousand Splendid Suns it has gotten a little violent it really wasn't amusing anymore. He is a great writer though but the Kite Runner rocks.
B0002W18MU|4.0|With a somber voice, Cash gently sings his final studio recordings with a subtle release, however it is not the sound that will take you down in spirit so much as the songs themselves. They are like tomes, farewell notes and final goodbyes that touch on different subjects that all seem to point to the same outcome; that this is the end. It is not my favorite of the American Recordings but the fact that it is the last, with a song list that denotes such finality, it is sometimes more than haunting. Goodbye dear sir, I will miss the songs that were never sung but am happy to be experiencing the laughter, loss and love that weave together in the ones that you did.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|This is definitely their best CD to date. I love that they have a definite style that they don't stray from, but still manage to make most songs interesting and unique. If you like the White Stripes, this is a must have.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding.  After successfully evading the CIA in the first film, he and girlfriend Marie (Franka Portente) are living in India.  Jason still doesn't remember very many details about who he is.  But he keeps having dreams that may give him a clue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's about to be thrust back into the spy game.  A mission is going on in Berlin.  When it goes south, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) wants answers.  The trail leads to a buried CIA project.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bourne has started moving again and he trips the radar, bringing the CIA down on him.  Can he figure out why they are suddenly interested in him?  What do his dreams mean?  Will he get another piece of the puzzle of who he is?<br /><br />So I wasn't a fan of the original, but I sat down recently to watch the second one.  My main complaint about the first one was the plot.  It was better here since all the characters behaved believably the entire way through.  The plot was still needlessly confusing, and the characters are still pretty wooden.<br /><br />My biggest complaint this go around is the camera work.  It's shaky the entire way through.  What's worse are the action scenes.  They are so poorly edited it's almost impossible to follow what is happening.  I realize this is a stylistic approach, but it doesn't work.<br /><br />I can see the appeal of the franchise for those who like mindless thrill rides.  But those who look for more then that should approach with caution.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Normally I don't bother to review things, but this music and movie are so special, I want to help promote them both. I've seen the movie three times and there were only a handful of people in the theater on any of the three occasions. Way too bad - especially when so much garbage out there gets huge numbers. Anyway, I've become a new fan of both the Frames and Glen Hansard. The music he and Merketa make together is exceptional. Everyone I've turned on to them has loved it. Just wish they were getting a bigger audience - they certainly deserve it! Buy the CD, you won't be disappointed.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|This is about the 4th reincarnation of MORRISON HOTEL (one has to wonder if in years to come we'll be treated to takes 4,8 and 25 of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" before the well runs dry) and I've owned them all.  Basically, if you're a casual fan stick with the earlier remasterings as the 40th Anniversary will be a bit unusual to the ear...the extra vocalizations do not detract from the songs and they can be gotten used to and, what the heck, the remaining members need the money so shell out the bucks (they're bargain priced anyway).  Of all the recent re-releases, this one is the best as there's lots of bonus tracks (uneven quality but different versions of Peace Frog, The Spy, Queen of the Highway are good for repeated listenings).  Personally, MORRISON HOTEL is probably their most variable release: rocking out (Roadhouse, Peace Frog, Land Ho), spooky-beautiful ballads (Blue Sunday, Indian Summer, The Spy) and just plain Morrison wierd (Waiting for the Sun, Queen of the Highway) that only the Doors could do. One of the reasons people will continue to listen to these classics is the wonderful musicianship these guys (who were only in their early to mid 20s) displayed in their relatively short time together.  It was obvious they would burn bright and if Morrison didn't die when he did (but how could he not) they'd be on their 5th reunion tour rehashing these classics.  The Doors sounded like professionals right out of the gate and the 6 remasters will live on (how many versions is up the surviving members and their heirs).  Great re-engineering, liner notes, pix, etc.
B00005JP5P|4.0|[SPOLIER] it was surprisingly good, keeping tension and mystery constant throughout. my only complaint is that if felt like it ended abruptly, with most of the crew dying within the last 10 minutes.  other than that, sci-fi at its best, with a particular emphasis on the \\"fi\\".  oh, and for the reviewer who gave it 1*, \\"irregardless\\" is not a word, unless you really meant to say \\"not without regard\\" or \\"with regard\\".
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Like many others, I found out only after buying this crappy product, that the battery only has a short life.  The whole thing worked great when I first got it - hard surface floors, carpets, light weight, easy to use.  I was always very careful to only leave the battery plugged in the charge no longer than directed.  Even so, after just a month or two, the thing has died.  It'll hold a charge for no more than a few minutes.  It would get five stars with a working power source.  As is, it's a complete waste of money and is going in the garbage.
0385522401|5.0|\\"On Chesil Beach\\" by Booker Prize winning author Ian McEwan is a masterpiece--one of those rare books that keeps getting better the more the reader thinks about it and studies how it was crafted to achieve its overall stunning effect. The book is set in a few brief hours--actually one late afternoon and evening--in or near a hotel room on Chesil Beach in the south of England. It is a honeymoon and both the husband and the wife are virgins. Through seamless transitions to flashbacks, McEwan artfully weaves in just enough background information so that we feel we know and understand these vulnerable and fragile young 22-year-olds. They are truly in love, but they are on a collision course to disaster.<br /><br />I disagree with many of the other reviewers here on Amazon who believe that this couple's wedding night disaster is partially or wholly caused by the period in which the novel is set--a time just before the sexual revolution of the mid-1960s. The message of this work is clearly not one of criticism for the sexual mores of any particular historical period. What happens to this young couple could happen at any time, in any culture--even today when sex is matter-of-fact, and in-your-face, everywhere, all the time.<br /><br />The message of this novel is a lovingly crafted lament. It is about the appalling lack of communication that can exist all too easily between people who truly love each other, and how this silence about essential matters of the heart can rise up like an erupting volcano and suffocate even the most promising relationship. Miscommunication is at the heart of nearly all breakups, be they between lovers, spouses, friends, or family members. McEwen takes one all-important miscommunication on a wedding night and shows how it can ruin lives. He puts a spotlight on the road not taken, and challenges us to rethink how it might have been otherwise.<br /><br />I am awed by this book. McEwan is a master, a compelling and powerful storyteller, with an all-important message to convey. Read this novel; hear this lament; sing it silently in your mind's ear whenever you are tempted to strike back in anger at some wrong you think was unmistakably meant directly to harm you. Think again. Grow up. It's not about you! Loved ones generally act first and foremost out of their own self-interest, not out of any kind of desire to hurt the beloved. Realize that there is probably a significant miscommunication at the root of the problem and find out what it is before you act too hastily and with anger. Let the heartfelt lament of this book fuse itself to your being. Maybe this book will help you save an important relationship from failure, help you avoid your next--and perhaps most regrettable--road not taken.onvey.

B000FIMHLC|4.0|This i s the re-issue of the first album by Dr Feelgood. I remember buying it aroung 1980-82 or so. I had bought the great case of teh shakes and this was supposed to be their classic (it does contain Roxette). I returned it to Divertimento. Now having grown accustomed to Wilko Johnson's guiter playing I mus reappraise this record. The quality of the recording is probably what did not please me and this is explained in the liner notes, where they explain that they wanted a more raw sound. There is a second CD filled with bonus material. The bonus material sounds better because it contains real stereo mixes with a better separation of instruments. On tese versions you can hear better Wiko's great playing.  While it has aged overall and I personally think they have done better stuff it is a decent pu rock record.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Being a newer Rammstein fan(I recently began listening to these guys about two months ago here in Iraq), I have to say that these guys have single-handidly helped me get through this long and tedious deployment.  I have been sheltered for about the past 3 1/2 years, and didn't know much about these guys except \\"Du hast\\" back in 1997.  I purchased the song \\"Amerika\\" from their fourth studio album, \\"Reise, Reise\\" and was floored.<br /><br />I had to have more, so I purchased another song from this album, \\"Reise, Reise\\", and was captivated.  I decided to finally just purchase the whole album and am glad I did.  Not one song on here disappoints.  From start to finish, this album simply rocks!  This CD got me hooked on this band, so I decided to purchase the rest of their albums and I now consider myself a die-hard R+ fan!  These guys are all I listen to now.  Everybody else seems to be \\"blah\\" to me.  These guys have so much passion for what they do, and every song is a sign of that.<br /><br />This album is at the top of my list, not only for my favorite Rammstein album, but my favorite album of all-time!  It's that good, folks.  If you want heavy, driving songs that'll get your blood pumping, you'll get em' here(Mein Teil, Keine Lust, Amerika, Morgenstern, Stein Um Stein).  If you want ballads, so to speak, or \\"slower\\" songs, this album has that as well(Reise, Reise, Ohne Dich).  Or if you just want songs that'll make you tap your feet to the beat or sing along(if you know German, or can memorize the words somehow), this CD provides you with that as well(Dalai Lama, Los, Moskau).<br /><br />Overall, I must say that this album introduced me to this band and got me hooked on them.  Being bored one day and needing new music for the gym paid off.  If I can get anything positive from this deployment in the end, it will be the fact that I was introduced to one of the heaviest and most musically-gifted bands in the world-Rammstein!  I don't think I'll find a better album or more interesting band for as long as I live!  Pick this album up.  You will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />I'd give it a 10-star rating if I could!  It's that good!  Enjoy!nd for as long as I live!  Pick this album up.  You will NOT be disappointed.      I'd give it a 10-star rating if I could!  It's that good!  Enjoy!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was a sophomore in high school when MSCL was on the air and immediately fell in love with the show and related to its characters. More than a decade later, MSCL still holds up as the most realistic portrayal of teenage life I've ever seen on television and I'm still in love with it! The characters are so true to life! They use 'like' in just about every sentence and the dialogue is simple and poignant without sounding like it comes straight out of some corny teen movie. They even wear the same outfits more than once and don't always look like they stepped right out of a fashion magazine. It's a shame that MSCL only lasted 19 episodes. Few shows have been as touching or affected me as much as MSCL has. I still get chills when I watch the Halloween and Christmas episodes. This DVD set is a must-have for TV fans of all ages. Anyone is sure to find at least one character they can relate to in the remarkable cast. I can't say enough about this outstanding series!
B00005JPLW|3.0|This Film was Enjoyable, Great Special Effects, Nice Cinematography BUT this film just cannot compare to The Old Hollywood Classics such as Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Ten Commandments and others. To Me, \\"300\\" seemed to be the LAZY way to make a movie, using all the Computer enhancements, it really took the feeling out of the movie. I hope this doesnt start a trend because computers just cannot replace actual battle scenes. For all The People who rate this movie 5 stars, go buy or rent some of the old classic movies that have similiar stories and battle scenes, and then get back to me and tell me how great this film was. \\"300\\" isnt bad, Gerard Butler was PERFECTLY CAST and did a Brilliant Job and it was an enjoyable film to watch but it was just a  little too slick for my taste. i also agree with the other reviewer that said Gladiator was much better, I totally agree. I would recommend this film but 50 years from now, it will be forgotten!
B000002KYK|1.0|This soundtrack is equivalent to seeing some joker at Applebees playing Jimi Hendrix songs in the corner vs. seeing Jimi play front row at Woodstock - no comparison. When I picked-up this cassette in the 80's and played it for the first time, I said, \\"W.T.F.?\\" Just buy the REAL soundtrack by Vangelis.
B000002NJS|5.0|This album is one of Madonna's finest and strongly shows her musical development.<br />It showcases her powerful voice and is more mature and eclectic than her earlier work. Ultimately this is a blend of  New Age music, electronica-pop and a touch of r&b.<br />It reflects 'her swimming ot the ocean floor' with her dive into spirituality, which is strongly revealed on her reflective first track, Drowned World/Substitute For Love, the second track has an r&b feel to it Swim, combined with the aquatic imagery.<br />I also like the techno-pop Ray of Light, the erotic Candy Perfume Girl, the electro-pop Nothing Really Matters , the New Age Shanti/Ashtangi sung in Sanskrit, the romantic To Have And Not To Hold and the beautiful Little Star.<br />In my opinion one of the best albums of the 1990's.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of the year if not the decade. Imaginative and thoughtful lyrics, excellent musicianship perfectly integrated with tastfully orchestrated electronics, not to mention superb, seamless engineering. Nuf said
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Some of the best music in rock was made in a folksy revival in the late 60's and early 70's, as artists were simultaneously celebrating the free love era and coming to terms with its limits and dark underbelly.  This time of tension and introspection produced albums like Music From Big Pink, Astral Weeks, the White Album, John Wesley Harding, Sweet Baby James, and American Beauty.    What's remarkable about Cold Roses is that Ryan Adams has not just listened to this music, he has inhaled it in spirit and substance (and inhaling is a pretty appropriate image for this album!).  Yes, the songs are to some extent unoriginal, in the sense that they feature the kind of mimicry that Adams sings about in \\"Mockingbird.\\"  But the music he's imitating is wonderful, and he's excellent at capturing not just its free-form, jamnming sound, but also its haunting ambiguities.    Those who want straight country should skip this one, and maybe get Jacksonville City Nights instead.  To enjoy and fully appreciate this album, you probably have to be a fan of the late 60's music that blended country, folk, and psychedelia.  There's a reason Phil Lesh loves Ryan Adams: this is probably the best Grateful Dead studio album in decades--or it would be if only the Dead had recorded it.
B00005JPLW|2.0|The compression is horrible.  I have a $2.99 single layer Three Amigos DVD that looks better.  You probably won't notice the poor video quality on a standard def. television but it's hard to stomach on an HD TV.  I have a Sony upconverting DVD player and it has always given me an outstanding picture on my 50' HD Sony SXRD, but not even a great upconverting DVD player can save this DVD.  I love the movie but two stars is all I can give this DVD.
B000000XBC|4.0|The only thing better than obtaining Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Chronicles' is getting all their original albums first hand.  One minor problem with 'Chronicles 2' is that the song sequence is sometimes out of place.  This second collection is basically the leftovers of 'Chronicles' 1. But, boy, what leftovers.      As a testament to the greatness of the group, the best songs, including \\"Born on the Bayou,\\" \\"Walking on the Water,\\" and \\"Molina,\\" are formidable indeed.  Also essential are hidden gems like \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" and \\"Pagan Baby\\".  Despite their fame for original songs, the collection provides some fine covers of \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly,\\" \\"Hello Mary Lou,\\" and \\"The Midnight Special\\".  \\"Cotton Fields\\" really puts some life in an old traditional song.  \\"Don't Look Now\\" is a decent variation of \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\".  Although some of the rest isn't always as great.  \\"Wish I Could Hideaway\\" and \\"It's Just a Thought\\" are good, but pale in comparison to the rest, and \\"Suzie Q, Pt. 2\\" is a decent, but non-essential, elaboration on the original.      Especially for those without a limitless budget, 'Chronicles 2' is a fine supplementary sampler, continuing the greatness for most of us who can't get enough of CCR or 'Chronicles'.
0440241413|4.0|First time reader of Sophie Kinsella and not going to be the last.  I plan on reading more of her series of books.     It shows these addiction of shopping lead to lies and deceit.  Actually, this open my eyes to my shopping obsession.    Good read and a great awareness.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is an incredible album.  I can listen to the entire thing from beginning to end without skipping any songs.  This is great listening from a true artist with an astonishing length of reference for lyrics.  If you like something mellow to drive and listen to on long trips, this is the album for you.
B00005JKGZ|4.0|It is an old favorite.  What can I say?  Everyone loves this one.
B000P2A256|3.0|In short I saw these guys at the Belly up for 91 cents and they were incredible.  They did a cover of \\"Closer\\" by NIN that would blow the doors off any venue!  When Songs about Jane came out I couldn't believe how much of their edgy sound had been completely produced out of the final product.  These guys have great potential but they are too busy selling to a commercial generation for me to realize it.  At 30 minutes I think I'll pass on their next album when it comes out in 2013.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is not the Dylan of the 60's (or 70's or 80's). A lot of the growl in his voice is gone and there is a lyric quality to it. The songs have a lilt, a rhythm and lift, to them that is infectious. The lyrics are as good as anything Dylan has written. It is one to listen to over and over again.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Despite being an adorable little chicken, something feel extremely off about this movie.  The plot is way too campy and well, weird.  Apparently, the budget couldn't afford original music and so we're left with a lot of Karoke stuff.  Some sentimental lines sound eerily like rips from Finding Nemo.  I fell a sleep on the movie the first time and the second time, I kept wondering how much longer the film was-when it was a short movie to begin with.  Overall, this movie totally missed the mark, but very young children may enjoy it, but probably would get a lot more out of something like Jimmy Newtron or something.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|Expectations for many were very higher after they saw the first Matrix film.  I was one of these sheep that was lead to the slaughter.  Matrix 2 cannot be Matrix 1.  What was new in fresh in the first film must inevitable become overblown in the second film.  The film couldn't meet people's expectation, and many criticize the Matrix sequels.  I almost didn't even bother seeing the last film, but after Revolutions redeemed the series and I realized that I didn't give the sequels a proper chance.      The Matrix was an incredible film.  The style and flow of the first movie was amazing.  The story seems fresh in the way it was told, even though it is a science-fiction staple.  Reality and human nature were explored in pop philosophy that even found its way to academia.  Bullet time seemed so original and amazing a concept that just about everyone that saw the movie agreed that it was revolutionary.    In the Matrix Reloaded, the story had to expand from its beginnings.  Now, the viewer is taken to Zion and the real world.  Not that the Matrix itself wasn't important but now our attention is also on this post apocalyptic society.  I don't think anyone I know was impressed with the design of Zion or the people.  The movie fails on a basic level because I think most viewers don't connect at all to Zion.  We know and have strong connections to Morpheous, Neo and Trinity, but these new ideas and characters don't make as big an impact.  Just about ever scene in Zion is ill-conceived.  The council scenes, Morpheous's speech, the rave, etc. are not really all that interesting.  The bigger cast means there is even more chance to have some mediocre actors in the movie and bad dialogue.  Zion fails not only because of design but also these dismal scenes, most of which are not key to the plot but rather, suck up screen time.  In a perfect world, these movies could be re-written and shot and this movie would be much, much better.      Then, you have the person formerly known as Agent Smith, now just Smith and also Bane.  This expansion of his role worked well.  Smith is a great villain and his ability to replicate himself like a virus adds some menace to his character.  Unfortunately, this ability allows for the battle sequences with Neo vs. hundreds of Smiths.  A shorter fight sequence probably would have worked better and been more impressive but it looks like a video game and just puts a drag in the story.    The introduction of non-agent programs in the matrix as sentient beings was a good addition, even better utilized in the last film.  The expansion of the matrix works much better than the inclusion of the real world.  The other agents, particularly the ghostly twins are pretty cool.  The battle sequences that rely more on bullet time, than video game graphics are still pretty good.  The use of melee weapons is pretty good.    The most redeeming and worthwhile part of the film is of course the highway chase.  Great effects and huge suspense.  It is beautiful if chaos/ action sequences can be called such.    The scene with the Architect is slightly confusing.  After a second viewing it makes more sense though.  It does tie everything, Matrix, Zion and the rest of the world in perspective.  I did like the scene in general, but like all the films the dialogue could use some touching up.    Most action movies don't win acting awards or script awards, and you don't expect anything amazing from these sort of films.  But there is a level of what is acceptable and what is really bad, and actually all the Matrix films walk a fine line between the two.      The philosophical aspects of the series are not as profound or evident in this particular movie.  This movie out of all three seems the most pretentious and hits a kind of hollow note.  That's why this movie alone is not that amazing.  As part of the whole story it comes out looking much better.  The story set up in Matrix Reloaded is followed up very well in Revolutions, and IMO the serieshas a strong finish.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd is my favorite of Shania.  It has just enough pictures and interactions with the crowd, including the proposal, to make it more heartfelt and real without becoming sappy.  However the real star is Shania herself.  This was a very good, if not great performance by her, and the crowd seems to energize her and vice versa.  This ia must have for Shania fans, especially of her later works.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|This is the latest special limited edition released in the US.  Beautifully crafted, designed and packed as a collector's box-set. There are loads of extras in these 2 DVDs set.  Scripts, books and exclusive postcards available only for this edition. The recording is in high-defination resolution.  A must for all Final Fantasy and CG Animation fans.  A 'value-for-money' package.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|I kept hearing the name Michael Buble and finally checked him out. Heard \\"Always on my mind\\" on his MySpace page and was blown away. Loved his older hit \\"Home\\" too. Took a chance on this album when I saw it at Starbucks. Listened to it and....    Please don't try and be a new Frank Sinatra, just be yourself, Mike, you got the chops, as you clearly show on the sublime \\"Always on my mind\\". I never tire of listening to that track, but skip alll the others. My ears were bleeding listening to you butcher the Eric Clapton tune \\"Wonderful tonight\\".     The production is superb - big points for that: 1 star. 1 star for \\"Always on my mind\\".    I wish you would have recorded an entire album of new classic sounding tracks a la \\"Always on my mind\\". That would have been a 5 star album.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I loved the movie and the music. However, I'm very disappointed to discover that I cannot get the CD to copy to my iPod.  This is a pet peeve of mine - I buy the music, I should get to listen to it on whatever device I choose.
B000SQFC18|2.0|Haven't film fans suffered enough with these multi character films that center on race relations, communication misunderstandings ? After last years worst film of the year \\"Crash\\" (I know the Academy disagreed with me on that one) we get \\"Babel\\" another over wrought hit them of the head film about modern day race relations. I give this film one more star than I gave \\"Crash\\" because Cate Blanchett was in it and the story involving the Japanese teenager was interesting. Like \\"Crash\\" there were plenty of \\"oh brother are they serious\\" moments. The final moments when  it is revealed how all the stories are connected was well can you say STRETCH.  Oh well at least the Academy had the good sense not to repeat last years debacle.
B00005JPLW|5.0|When I saw this in the theatre I was mesmerized. And I don't really like violent films. But this was done in such an artistic manner that the visual \\"beauty\\" of the violence overshadowed the gore, so to speak. And Gerard Butler is spot-on as a strong and brave king. He was always first to throw down on the enemy. And throw down he did. Best movie I have seen ever, really. Particularly as far as the visuals are concerned.
B000000WZ4|4.0|DM certainly went through a dangerous hiatus... but they returned with form and style. This album shuffles amid powerful, affecting ballads, and 'punch-in-the-face' laments, always written over Martin's superb minor-chord styling and pop sensibility. A definite must-have for any Devotee.
0553382179|5.0|This is an incredible LIFE CHANGING book.  It really does all start with the kitchen sink.  Do you have chaos in your life (who doesn't?) that is holding you down?   This book will change your outlook on everything.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I love Bon Jovi, this cd is just another extension of their fabulous talent and view of music.  It's like listening to the stories the guys would tell their families.  Great buy!
B0000640VO|2.0|If you have children, show them affection and attention and never home school an only child.  Otherwise they will end up socially inadequate self isolated individuals who delight in lying, stealing, breaking and entering, causing physical and emotional harm to others, and other assorted felonies and misdemeanors.    I do not know what types of laws that they have in France, but here in the United States, there would be enough evidence for her to stand trial.    I do not celebrate her, or this movie.  I pity both. My rating is 1.5 stars.  That is only because I have a soft spot for gnomes. :)
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|The Bluray really makes this movie come to its full potential!    The HDDVD version always looked a little worse and Bluray is alot better for the money!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I bought this DVD which is of Cream's concert renuion, slightly and maybe cynically thinking that Cream's best days were behind them. I was wrong!They still had it maybe not quite the fire they had in '68 but they can still play and they played great together. I think the most interesting part of the DVD was spotting who was in the audience. I saw Brian May of Queen, John Peel,and Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac for starters! The enthusiam of the audiences towards Cream was amazing to see. I loved the version they did of Outside Woman Blues and Ginger Baker singing Pressed Rat and Warthog was a real crackup-he gives a big smile at the end and you can see he is so happy they are back together. As is Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton, they all keep smiling as in on some big secret at the recption they get from their fans.The DVD has interesting interviews with the group with them talking about Cream and the concerts etc.Great stuff.<br /><br />Cream were and still are one of the great rock trios.
0688163173|1.0|I bought this book because I saw it on a list of great thrillers. That was a lie. This book was not at all involving. It was full of unbelievable situations and there was not real development. I always keep books but this one I abandoned. No more Dennis Lehane for me.
0780626966|5.0|My husband recieved this collection as a gift, and we both really enjoy it. My fave movies in the series is the original, Part 3, and The New Nightmare. They all have their good and bad points, but that's part of what makes them true horror classics.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A movie that you can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time.
630521610X|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I've ever seen that scares me each and every time I watch it. It was also one of the few shows where I hadn't figured out who the killer was before hand. If you haven't seen this, make it one of your next rentals!
B000PFUA9G|4.0|Brad Paisley has once again released a great album.  I especially like Online.  A truer song has never been written!
0792151712|5.0|This movie came out when I was a senior in high school, and it was the theme of our prom that year. I remember that I went to the theater 5 times to see it, plus once more at the drive-in. The scenery, the sets, the lavish costumes, the music, oh the romance! I love this movie from start to finish. That said, it's not a movie for everyone. Most guys I know hate it. I guess it's one of those movies that you either love or hate, and I don't think reading anyone else's review is going to change your mind. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance!
B0001US8EO|5.0|I cannot attest to the film's complete authenticity, but it starts out telling an often told tale.  Young Wyatt Earp tried at least 4 times--beginning at the age of 13--to run away from home and join the Union Army.  In the film Gene Hackman, playing his father, stops him and sends him back home.  This scene and the one following where Virgil and James Earp return from the War are two of the most compelling in the film.      The remainder of the two-disk film closes with Wyatt much older having survived the Western frontier and moving on to Alaska.  It's a hopeful ending and a beautifully filmed one, too.      The other aspect of this film I liked best was James Newton Howard's soundtrack.  The ex-Toto musician can really bring life to a scene and more often than not when I have enjoyed a soundtrack, I've found James Newton Howard was somehow involved in the effort.
6304258984|4.0|I love this movie! It came as a suprise to me because I'm not normally a big fan of the action genre. The story itself has levels deeper than the special effects and explosions. You care about the characters and what has and will happen in their lives. Okay, completely believeable, not so much, but that's the fun of the action genre!
0618680004|4.0|I'm really glad I read this book. After accepting Buddhism as a way of life, which above all else requires observation of the world around you, I began to realize the possibility that God does not exist. Until I read this book, I thought I was the only one. Now I realize that the path to Enlightenment goes through becoming aware that there is no supernatural being controlling your life.<br /><br />Whether you are atheist, agnostic, or just secure enough in your beliefs to tolerate an opposing view, this is a must read.<br /><br />And if you have fundamentalist relatives, friends, or coworkers who enjoy pushing their beliefs upon you, this books not only contains the ammunition with which to defend yourself, but common belief breaking truths and concepts that will pull the wind from their sails. For instance, the founding fathers of the United States of America were, if not atheist, at least very very skeptical of the existence of God and organized religion.
B00003CWTH|3.0|I really like this movie, but it's not one that I can watch over and over again, like I can most other movies. There are many plots, subplots, twists and turns, but the story line with Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore was the best. It reduced me to sobs more than once. Everyone should see this movie, but don't be surprised if it's not one you'll be in a hurry to see again.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I play this one quite a lot, because there are so many great tracks on it.  It's great to dance to, though you can also use it for ambient music while you are cleaning or something equally mundane, just to liven things up a bit.  If there is another FF album, I would be interested in it.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Historically correct rendition of Beatrix Potter's life as she lived it  which was contrary to  a time when women were to be married within their own social status and dependent upon their husbands to provide for them.  It was well presented and depicted a woman of intelligence and talent who provided a means to protect a dying farming industry in the early 20th century in rural England.  This is also a love story that will break your heart but shows that strength in mind and spirit will provide for a happy ending.  Although this movie is not fast-paced, it will not seem to drag along and you will want to watch it more than once
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I was all set to enjoy a good action film with a fine cast, and sure enough the film began that way.  But very quickly after the main pivot point in the plot, the film spirals off into leftist paranoia and clumsy editorializing. A feeble  attempt at relevance has the reverse effect of turning the film trite and cliched. The villains that might have been interesting, had they been presented with any depth, became cartoonish stereotypes, and the plot became increasingly ludicrous and muddled with the result that any admiration for the craft involved was completely subsumed by this simplistic and trivial sermonizing.    Too bad, because I like Mark Wahlburg and Fuqua has shown he has good chops in the action genre and can present complex characters ala Training Day.  But if I needed another pretentious misrepresentation of facts, I need only access any number of mainstream media.  No doubt there is a vast audience that will either ignore the op-ed message in the film or will eat-it-up.  Sorry, I'm not interested in lame caricatures and simplistic conventional wisdom.  Maybe 1/2 more star  solely for the quality of the film-making despite the content.  It's not a horrible film, having some good moments before it descends into utter silliness.  No, sadly, it's a dumb film, that could have been much better, considering the talent involved.
B00003CXBK|5.0|i own all the film that were made like castle in the sky,Howl's moving castle, My neighbor totoro,Kiki's delivery service, The cat returns,Porco rosso,Spirited away and there all amazing and you will love each one i'm glad amazon had the one i brought were no one did thanks
B00005JMAH|5.0|My two daughter's love watching the Harry Potter movies and this one is no exception.
B00003CXCD|5.0|What an amazing delight!  I think Audrey Hepburn is sensational but I had never seen this film. My husband who had suffered through years and years of romantic movies on Saturday afternoons at the Capitol with his mother started off hostile and set to be dismissive. Well within minutes we were bewitched, charmed and delighted. Audrey Hepburn was so fresh and unselfconscious - it was as if she had forgotten the cameras were there and she was just having fun with these great grownups. There is one scene where her laughter is as thrilling and unconditional as a child's - lovely and poignant.  And Rome, that other character in the film! Well I found myself thinking - this movie was made in 1953 - that is well over a century ago and I know that the past is a foreign country and all that but this was as good as a holiday in Rome and in the past.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Not a true retelling of Thermopylae but a fantastic movie just the same and an excellent adaptation of Miller's graphic Novel. The choreography of the fight scenes is some of the best I have ever seen. Couple this with some well done special effects, and a good old fashion good guy bad guy plot line and this is a definite must own.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|These guys just rule.  It's a tight, concise album, that thankfully avoids the sophomore slump of trying to make a \\"Big Artistic Statement\\" (*cough* bloc party *ahem* killers) and instead focuses on rocking hard. There are no wasted notes or time on this album - none! The album is filled with razor sharp hooks and terrific musicianship, particular the spectacular drumming of Matt Helders. The often cryptic, but snidely clever and evocative lyrics and singing of Alex Turner is a real asset as well. Those involved in the recording, mixing, producing etc. deserve kudos as well - the sound just jumps out of the speakers! I love this album! Since I have no life, I listen to a LOT of music and I usually burn through albums quickly, listening once or twice and moving on, but this one I keep coming back to again and again and again.      This album is easily the best of '07 so far, BY FAR.
014100018X|3.0|I don't think that I have ever said that a movie was better than the book in my life, but I will have to say it now. I had high hopes for \\"Chocolat\\", thinking that it would have all of the charm, sweetness, seduction and delight of the movie (and would probably be even better). Instead I found the characters to be very 1 dimensional, the ending unsatisfactory, and I thought that the narrative of the preist was very disruptive to the flow of the story. Over all I was not impressed. I will admit, the descriptions of the chocolate were very yummy (and it did make me want to go eat chocolate) but on the whole I think that the movie was far more gorgeous than the book with the visuals, story line etc. Of course there were good aspects, the scene where the priest stuffs himself with chocolate is quite good, and the relationshop between Vianne and her daughter Anouk is sweet, but on the whole I think that this story just really does work better as a visual film. Plot gliches were also cleared up in the movie. Acting is wonderful, charming, one of my favorite movies. See the movie!!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|from beginning to end, this is incubus' best effort to date. crow might show off their talent and creativity a bit more ,  but as far as structure, and overall songs, this one takes the cake.  it acually just reminds me of a more polished and concise version of crow. where as crow is a bit more experimental, and full of energy , similar to their live show. both are great cds.   i first got into incubus when i heard stellar. make yourself and morning view quickly became 2 of my favorite albumss. since then i like to think my musical tastes have matured, but so have incubus. science and fungus are pretty mediocre nu metal/faith no more/bungle wanabe albums, with summer romance being the only worthwhile non novelty song from either.   make yourself starts to break the mold , and they finally come through as theirselves in morning view. then they ditch their bass player and pick up an open minded artist in ben kenney. from crow on out they are completely theirselves and the music is much better for it.  i believe they are better  when they are their poetic/slightly girly selfs.. but in the last two albums they are learning how to also incorporate their hard rock/experimental side without coming off as angsty, or trying to copy nu metal acts.  long live incubus
B000PHX8C0|5.0|devildriver is some of the best metal out there these days. if you miss pantera or superjoint ritual or even early 80s metallica then this is for you!
B000EZ7ZZE|1.0|I don't understand all the good reviews of this movie. The blu-ray transfer is not good. The movie looks grainy and blurry in some parts. It was almost like looking a standard DVD. And about the movie itself, it's very bad! If you want a good blu-ray transfer look further. I'm glad that this movie was free with the purchase of the PS3 because I wouldn't pay for it (not even as a rental).<br />The Resident Evil video games are better than this movie.
B000RJO578|5.0|I saw this at the movies. It was great!!! I did not like Shaun of the Dead , so I was a Little leary about seeing this movie. I laughed the loudest and the most out of all the other theater goers. I could not wait until it was on DVD so that I could own it and watch it over and over.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|I had almost given up on good metal becoming a reality in my lifetime (with a few rare exceptions of course) till the Priest reunited. I held my breath and hoped for at least a savory morsel from the past. That's not what I got: Judas Priest came back from the dead and kicked my arse! This is easily a collection of some of the best work of any metal band of any time...period. Judas Priest is REAL, and it shows in the music. It's classic Priest while being on the cutting edge of great metal.   Any metalhead must, and I repeat must own this CD. The DVD side reaffirms why metal isn't just great music to me but a way of life; it's an attitude about life and it's being part of a family (with a few disfunctional members like all families!).   Buy this CD and be prepared to raise your devil fist and be blown away.   All the best, MLC
B000RJO58M|5.0|LOVED this movie.  Haven't seen Shaun of the Dead yet, no doubt it will be just as awesome.  If you like British comedy (and if you don't you are likely a Jacka$$ fan), you will love this flick.  I won't go on in detail since many others have, but this is a brilliant comedy team.  And the HD-DVD is perfect.  Do yourself a favor and experience it today!!!
0679422714|5.0|According to at least 30 elder people around me (my parents, numerous uncles & aunts, their good friends, my friends' parents, my landlady and her family, etc...) who were in China and lived through that Culture Revolution nightmare, this book is hold so dearly to their hearts.  Many of them felt quite lucky to have lived through it and based on what they know, they agree with the author of this book completely.  I caught on the last 5 years of the Revolution and the vague memory I have of my childhood agrees with the authors opionions.      I also believe that truth will be revealed in time.  And I really do think that people will agree with most of statements in the book in another 20 years.
B000IOM0WY|3.0|I've already given this movie a 4 star rating with the regular DVD review so the 3 star is for the blu-ray transfer.This is probly the worst movie I've seen on blu-ray so far that was made in the past 10 years.The video is only slightly,slightly better than DVD and thats just becouse the colors are a tad bit more vibrant.The sound is standard 5.1,no uncompressed or TruHD.Maybe if this is the first time your buying this movie get the blu-ray but if you have the DVD I would suggest stay with that.
0765340798|3.0|As mentioned in my previous reviews of the Butlerian Jihad and The Machine Crusade, I will not hammer on about how this book/series does not stack up against Frank Herbert's work.     Now that I just finished with The Battle of Corrin, I will say that it was not the best book ever, but not the worst either. The story just plods and plods along until about the last 150 pages where it all comes together. Nothing ground breaking.     Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have an irritating tendency to re-explain everything about a character that I just read about in the last book. It is as if they chose to write each book to stand on its own (just in case someone does not read the entire series - most likely, anyone who reads this book will have already read the last two) I hope that they do not continue this trend with Hunters and Sandworms of Dune.    I was eager to find out the origins of the Atredies/Harkonnen fude, but was disappointed with it once I found out.     Rayna Butler and her whole crusade against machines is an element that could have used a lot more depth...I got the feeling that I was reading the script for Joan of Arc (a dumb movie in my opinion).    That being said, I am glad that I made it all the way through. I now know the origins of many of the myths and constructs in the original series. However, I most likely will never read it again (like I will with the classic dune series over and over and over again)    3 out of 5 stars for the book, 3.5 out of 5 stars for the whole series.      P.S. The most gripping portion of the whole book are the excerpts from Road to Dune where we see some deleted scenes from dune...to think, the scenes that made it to the scrap heap from the original were more thought provoking than the entire series.
0743496728|4.0|I paid $6.99 for express delivery on this item, however I did not receive this book quickly. I ordered it on 7/01/07, and it arrvived on 7/09/07. I ordered another book on the same day and requested normal delivery, and that book arrvied on 7/07/07, at the $3.99 postage rate.
0761145613|5.0|This calendar has columns for up to five family members' schedules. The boxes are big enough to write notes, locations, or multiple appointments. We keep ours hanging on the inside of the kitchen pantry door. We actually use this calender throughout the year.<br /><br />Other family calenders dont have enough space to write in, or enough columns for our five people; we've been very satified with this one.  Our kids are now teenagers - on one hand it means the cartoonish characters are not so appropriate.  On the other hand, we need a good schedule system now more than ever!
0340822783|5.0|My chief complaint with this book is the title. I was actually looking for \\"The Cloud Atlas\\" by Liam Callanan when I picked up this instead in the library, realized my mistake and read it anyway. What a knockout!     As other reviewers here say, the book features quite a welter of plot threads that take some time to weave into the fabric of a good story, but it's well worth the slight wait (my guess is you'll be hooked by the first page of chapter 3).     Yes, Mitchell does flex and flourish his dialects, but not to the point of distraction. And, yes, the book ends on a sci-fi note, but I wouldn't cast it as science fiction alone. It simply deals with human relationships that bridge time and anonymity...including the past and well into a speculative future. I found myself feeling more connected to humanity; not only to today's living cohort but also to yesterday's and tomorrow's. Now that's a trick.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|Absolute Garbage is a wonderful addition to the collection for the hard-core Garbage fan. With one new track (Tell Me Where It Hurts) and a remix (It's All Over But The Crying) this is a must have. And to top it all off a second disc of club style DJ remixes and one Garbage remix the Absolute Garbage 2 disc set is Absolutely a must have. For the new Garbage fan this is a grate way to start your collection or to add a new CD to your set with smoe of their best songs on one disc you can't go wrong.
0316018953|3.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly, who is probably the best crime writer working today.  THE OVERLOOK, though, is a pretty forgettable effort.<br /><br />THE OVERLOOK is Connelly's effort to do a novel like the 24 TV show.  The book takes place over a twelve hour period, and Bosch is working with the FBI to foil what looks like a terrorist plot.  As usual, Bosch makes a lot of enemies during his investigation, due to his irascible manner.<br /><br />This is a relatively short book, with more of a focus on pacing than character development.  I enjoyed it for what it was, but I prefer the longer Connelly books where he spent more time on characterization and creating a sense of place.  There are certain characters in THE OVERLOOK, for example, who are pretty much portrayed as two-dimensional buffoons, which no nuance whatsoever.  I'm not a big fan of this type of cartoonish characterization, and I think Connelly can do much better than this.<br /><br />There is also a twist at the end of this book that Connelly has used before in previous novels.  In fact, a lot of the scenes in this book struck me as kind of recycled from Connelly's earlier work.  Other than Bosch's relationship with his new partner, there is very little in this novel that struck me as original.<br /><br />This book is fun, but I must admit I expected a little more from it.  Worth reading, but not one of Connelly's best.
0743289684|5.0|What an eye opener this book was. I absolutley love the way she is able to write the facts as she lived them without ever coming off as a bitter, angry right wing fanatic(much to the dismay of the right wing conservatives who reveled at the chance to endorse a book by a black female of muslim descent,I'm sure). She writes with intelligence and grace (writting about your own genital mutilation and still managing to keep your dignity in tact has got to be difficult)and exposes a culture that for good or bad has takn its place at the front and center of our global community.
1594489505|3.0|Let's face it--if the author were an unknown and had not had such a widely read and popular first novel, SPLENDID SUNS would not be receiving so  much praise. This is not a bad book by far. It's got some things going for it, to be sure. But it really doesn't size up to the KITE RUNNER. It just doesn't. While that first book had so much zest and truthfulness to the characters and the story itself, things seem to fall a bit flat here.   Liked it ok. But  this does not measure up--a common problem when a writer has a terrific first book. Very hard to repeat the same success--quality-wise.     Not the best I've read this summer.
0060723513|1.0|I read this book a few years ago, with utter disbelief.  As the review above states, there is no way this woman knew anything about Australia, apart from what she may have garnered off the internet.  I rate this book 1 star only because there wasn't a zero star option.    It is a fact across all Aboriginal peoples (and there are more than 1) that a man would NEVER reveal any tribal secrets to a woman and vice versa. This one fact alone tells me the book is utter rubbish.  I'm only sorry the Aborigines of Australia could not take a class action against this woman. Don't buy the book.  Come to Australia and see for yourself.

0142000663|1.0|I should have known that a book you can buy togehter with Cliff's Notes is going to be boring. I read \\"East of Eden\\" and thought it was great. I was hopeful that \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" would be just as good. No luck. It's dull as heck. I don't see how this is thought by many to be Steinbeck's best.

B0000027I6|4.0|I actually bought this on casette a week or two after it came out in '92 and didn't really care for it. It wasn't until Waters put out the live DVD a few years ago that I regained an interest in the album, since he did several of the tracks live on tour that year. I then picked up the CD from Amazon for less than $10 and started listening to it again. For some reason what I didn't get then seemes much clearer now almost 15 years later. This definitely is Waters best solo work, on par with \\"The Final Cut\\" or \\"Animals\\", though not as strong as \\"The Wall\\". Unlike KAOS, this album holds up well and almost seems more relavent now than when it was initially written. My favorite track is \\"The Bravery of Being Out Of Range\\". I guess it takes on a whole new mean in the neo-con Bush era. Hopefully now that David Gilmore has put out a new solo disc it will goad Roger in to matching him with a new CD.
B000063UR2|3.0|I bought this film because I got a really good deal. I had forgotten that I had actually seen this film before.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW, A lot crappier than I remembered. Now I know why I forgot I'd seen it; it's pretty forgettable. (You can mark \\"No\\" on the \\"was this helpful\\" tab now if you have not upon seeing 3 stars). Personally I find all the unabashed supporters to be of no help at all. I learn nothing from people who love everything about a film.<br /><br />I should have read more negative reviews of this film. Here's a list to break down how I got to 3 stars for this film :( a few spoilers=** if you care).<br /><br />The Film:<br />-I like Ridley Scott. I don't think he did his best work here.<br />-I like fantasies. This one was a little too dreamy for me. I like believing the fantasy I'm watching.<br />-sound track was mind numbing. You pick which one.<br />-Heroes were hard to like. Lily was a spoiled little trollop who would not respect the warnings of her best friend and \\"lover\\". The elves and such were also self centered and unreliable for the most part. I really did not care too much if they got defeated.<br />-Villain was too likable. Tim curry makes this film and then he was not used enough. He could have taken this character to so many better places than it ended up.<br />-Costumes (other than Curry's) were pretty lame, even for the mid-80s. They looked allot like stage costumes (and bad ones at that).<br />-This film either took itself too seriously or not seriously enough. \\"Labyrinth\\" actually found its place (Just light enough) where \\"legend\\" did not.<br />-Action was obscure or just poorly staged. How many times does Tom Cruise jump over a sword slash? I lost count.<br />-Unicorn sequences were actually artfully done and very dream-like (kind of like in \\"Blade runner\\". **However, it was never explained how the horn was replaced on the one unicorns head at the end of the film.<br />-**Blaming the girl for the demise of the unicorn just did not make sense. The goblins found the unicorn despite her. I'd blame Tom cruise for leading them the hidden place. The unicorn was going to get darted even if she did not touch them.<br />-A really empty feeling world. Where are all the people? I think there might have been 15 people in this entire film. Pretty lifeless and lame.<br />-**Just not that great a story. Very clich&eacute; and unimaginative. Evil plots to rule the good world and make it bad. Starts to succeed. Heroes have a quest. Heroes have set-backs. Heroes defeat the odds and the bad guy. All is back to normal. Boy gets girl. Have I not seen this story a dozen times before? Sure that's the basis for many stories. But at least try to add a twist or 2.<br />-Despite all this negativity, I found this film entertaining to a certain degree. I kind of had to turn my mind off a little though (I know, \\"it must be easy\\").<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-Packaging is cool.<br />-2 versions of the movie. Can't complain.<br />-2 bad soundtracks. Oh well.<br />-Picture looks like it was cleaned up a bit. Still too murky looking. Could someone please remove my cataracts?<br />-extras are nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />So, for those of you who got this far without hitting the \\"no\\" tab, I congratulate you for actually having enough sense to read before judging whether or not this was helpful. You can still hit \\"no\\" if you want. I won't mind.despite her. I'd blame Tom cruise for leading them the hidden place.

1582701709|1.0|A cheesy slick marketing juggernaut trying to sell air to the masses.  Oh my God....how insulting.  One gigantic infomercial.  I kept waiting for the punchline ( Will you please tell me the price?). People would be better off reading classical literature and philosophy written by great men and women, and the great works of all religions.  That's where the true secret lies.  I can sum this book up in one line, \\"Pretend your a Magnet that attracts good things and you will attract good things.\\"  Wow!!  How much money do you want to spend for that.  Psst....let me tell you a secret.....there is no secret...not in this book!

068983571X|5.0|I have lost track of how many times I have read this, or how many different adaptations I have watched, or listened to. I still enjoy it every single time. A true classic. Suspense, horror and sneakiness abound, particularly between the major characters. What is going on? It keeps you captivated all along, should not be too many people that don't like this. Large black ghost hounds, your Jane Austen type gentlemen in trouble, dodgy locals, and the brilliance of Holmes.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|ZODIAC starts off with a bang, and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over. Furthermore, since the case was never really solved, there's no real payoff at the end--just more speculation.<br /><br />Despite this, it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle), its crime reporter (ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.) and cartoonist (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner (ANTHONY EDWARDS) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer.<br /><br />The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives. The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher, and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer. But after the murder of a taxicab driver, the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition.<br /><br />JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case. He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject. His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information. His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution. It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed.<br /><br />The other performances are uniformly good, but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role. Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain.<br /><br />Summing up: Suspenseful and well directed, but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work.to the relentless detective work.
0060763892|4.0|The Judas Strain is  completely typical of a James Rollins novel.  A mixture of science, pseudo-science, history, a little religion and a completely formulaic plot that accelerates to a breakneck pace and satisfying conclusion.  It was great.  No one is ever going to confuse this stuff with great literature but it's hard to deny that Rollins' books are fun, interesting and exciting.<br /><br />This is another Sigma Force novel, with the boys (and girls) of that semi-shady DARPA governmental agency dedicated to fighting the forces of evil (in this case, \\"the Guild\\" again\\") over control of new technology that could threaten national security, or, (here again), the fate of the entire world.  All your favorites are back - Painter, Gray,  Lisa, Monk, and even the villainess from a couple of books ago, the beautiful and deadly Seichan now turned ally.<br /><br />This one has a decidedly biological bent to it but still had the trademark combination of history, science and religion and beautiful scenery convering  most of the world, plus some twists and a sort of a cliffhanger ending.  I missed the previews of coming attractions that are usually found at the end of the book so I guess I'll just have to wait another year.  He seems to turn them out like clockwork.  If you liked this one try some of his others - Sandstorm, Bag of Bones and Black Order would be my recommendations.
0316067598|5.0|This book - or more accurately, the story it tells - is simply incredible! Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson do a fantastic job recounting Luttrell's Navy SEAL training, and then how that training allowed him to survive impossible odds (while inflicting untolled harm on his enemies) to tell what really happened to him and his team of SEALs in the Taliban/al Qaeda infested mountains of Afghanistan. It was deeply impactful to me, and then watching my wife read his story - tears running down her face as she kept muttering \\"this is unbelievable... just unbelievable\\" was marvelous.    Whatever you think about how the war against Islamo-facsisim has been prosecuted, you will be immeasurably proud of Luttrell and his fellow SEALs. To say that he is a hero way understates his service to our country. This book should be required reading for every single American over the age of 13!

B00005JPLW|5.0|Doubt anyone will wade through the hundreds of 5 star posts and read mine...<br /><br />Personally I loved 300, I went in with the expectation that it was going to be bloody, action packed, stylish, and fun; came out with all of those checked off.  I have to admit that it was a bit corny and parts of the story didn't really add to the movie/graphic novel overall, but I didn't watch it for the story as much as I did for the visuals.  The fight scenes are what I enjoyed the most. Other action movies like to portray a fight scene by moving from angle to angle and using a shaky camera style where you can't really focus on the character's movements.  I am a big fan of Kung Fu movies and American B action movies and the thing that drew me to 300's action is the use of time distortion.  The action slows down so you can see them fighting CLEARLY, which adds to the tension of battle and gives you a sort of adrenalin rush.  Maybe not Oscar worthy but it is going on my shelf next to Sin City, where I can pull it out and run it for drunk party goers.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Frank Miller's comic properties have become ripe for the picking lately (Sin City was a smash with a sequel on the way, and Ronin was just optioned as well), and his epic dramatization of the Battle of Thermopylae is brilliantly brought to the screen by Zack Snyder (2004's Dawn of the Dead, the upcoming Watchmen) with enough style to spare.  300 tells the tale of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler in a star making role), who led his cadre of Spartan warriors against the oncoming horde of Persian troops commanded by the self-proclaimed Xerxes (Lost's Rodrigo Santoro).  With it's innovative blend of live action and CGI effects and techniques, 300 manages to stay surprisingly faithful to it's comic book material (including shot by shot references to Miller's artwork) while Snyder adds a political sub-plot featuring the Queen (Lena Headey) that paces out the battle scenes, surging testosterone, and bloody action.  The visual style is worth seeing 300 for alone even if you're not a fan of Miller's graphic novel, and the cast (which also includes the narrating David Wenham and The Wire's Dominic West) is great as well.  I've got to hand it to Zack Snyder; the man has crafted one of the best comic to film adaptations of all time that remains faithful to Frank Miller's original vision.  Let's only hope Snyder can work the same kind of magic with the infinitely more challenging Watchmen.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Okay...okay, I'm not going to actually list 300 reasons, but the title wouldn't be as interesting if I said \\"3 reasons to watch 300\\"...anyway    #1: The movie starts off with anticipation and build already in place--Some movies take FOREVER to start with anticipation, but 300 doesn't do that; the anticipation begins as soon as the movie begins because the beginning introduces you to the characters; whereas other movies drain time to introduce their main characters, which can lead to BORING moments...this problem does not exist in 300. To give you an idea of a movie with that problem, think of \\"Hulk\\".    #2: The CGI--The effects in this movie are amazing with VISUALS I have NEVER seen in other movies. Simple as that!!!    #3: The movie is basically REAL ancient history with a fictional twist--After watching this movie, I watched the special features and googled information about the Spartans and was amazed to see not everything in 300 was FICTIONAL and the some of the events in the movie REALLY did happen (No, I'm not talking about the giants elephant-looking creatures...you ACTUALLY thought they were REAL???)    Easily a 5-Star Movie
B0002X314C|3.0|John Legend is a great and wonderful singer composer etc.,  but cursing on a CD takes away from an album, it changes the feeling you get from it.  I got this on sale, and since I didn't see any warning about elicit content I didn't worry even though I saw Snoop Dog as one of the persons featured on the CD so I figured safe buy.  I should have know better the people who produce these CD led you to think it is a safe buy when it is not then you get it home and you are disappointed.  For those that don't care about such things it is a great CD great smooth sounds and great lyrics.  I just wish I could get some art without negative hate word such as cursing, unless it serves meanful purpose in what the artist is trying to convey and not just saying it because they can. For instance if you happen to be telling a story in your song and you are angry then that maybe appropriate to have a curse word because curse words are used to convey anger.  You don't use a curse word to convey how much you love some one or lust for them.  You certainly won't get a kiss from me!  I need to research these CDs before I buy them even if there isn't a warning on them.  Before buying a CD check [..] and see if it is appropriate if you are about positive living.  I would buy another John Legend CD because I think is his an artist with integrity.
0452287022|2.0|This slim book does not deserve the praise heaped upon it. How absurd to imagine a young maid, without any background or instruction in art, will explain to the master-painter Vemeer how his paintings might be improved. Griet sees the flaws in the paintings and wonders why Vemeer does not correct them - yeah, that's plausible. Not once is Griet wrong in her criticism/suggestion on how the painting might be improved.  Unexplained in this lame plot is why Griet's situation is so precarious - the master instructs her to mix the colors - but if his wife finds out Griet is carrying out his instructions, there will be hell to pay! But why? And why is the other servant so jealous that Griet is mixing the colors?? The extra work doesn't sound fun.  One of Vemeer's daughter's torments Griet for no apparent reason (other than to create plot \\"tension\\") - oh no! Griet might lose \\"everything she has\\" - but what she has is nothing but a low paying, hard working job as a maid. And losing the job is no big deal anyway, she can go marry the butcher's son who lusts after her. (What an anti-romance the courtship of Griet by Pieter is - how dull, how devoid of passion, - their \\"dates\\" consist of Pieter groping her body in an alley!)  Usually \\"literature\\" that is this weak in plot makes up for it with beautiful prose, but the prose in this novel is merely workmanlike. This is no masterpiece. I was glad the book was only 288 pages in the hardcover edition.
B000RJO58M|5.0|Home theater enthusiasts this could be your reference disc for sound.  I own about 40 hd dvds now and going by memory this is the best sounding one yet.  The 5.1 Dolby digital plus ex sound gives all speakers a thorough workout and  has your sub delivering tight bass for the majority of the movie.  Your receiver need not be turned up during dialogue that is also spot on and delivers crisp sound from the center channel.    As for the movie itself, director Edgar Wright re teams with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost along with a host of other actors from his earlier film Shaun of The Dead.  Hot Fuzz like Shaun pays homage to a genre of films, in this case the action film as opposed to horror.  However there are kills in Hot Fuzz that could rival most horror movies.  Homage is payed to the action genre, yet Hot Fuzz still creates a totally unique and creative spin all on it's own.  I like Shaun of the dead very much and I found Hot Fuzz to be more creative as there are plenty of plot twists and turns.  It is not a spoof at all and Edgar Wright takes his material seriously.  I would also mention Hot Fuzz is a great deal better than the action films it pays homage to.  Toss in a ton of laughs and this is one entertaining movie.  The picture quality was also dead on, i mention the sound quality so much because it was so amazing.  Hot Fuzz is already ranked on the internet movie database's top 250 films at number 140 currently.  It is also one of the highest reviewed films of the year earning a tomatometer of 90% out of 173 critic reviews.  Thanks for reading, share any thoughts.

0399142533|5.0|Killing Floor was Lee Child's first book featuring ex-military cop and all-around hero Jack Reacher. Published in 1997, Child's debut novel (and especially his rugged-individualist protagonist) struck a nerve with audiences in the U.S. and in his native England and established him as a new force to be reckoned with in the emerging thriller genre. Even a decade later, anyone reading this book will immediately see why.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is the consummate thriller hero. He's the ultimate man's man--unflinchingly brave, an unapologetic warrior for justice, street-smart, handsome, and huge (six-five)--and with just enough of a soft, sensitive side to capture any woman's heart. He's John Wayne meets Jack Bauer meets Dirty Harry, a literary hero whose exploits and adventures (and misadventures) are just plain fun to read about.<br /><br />And the hero is far from the only thing to enjoy about Lee Child's writing. From its opening line (\\"I was arrested in Eno's diner\\"), Killing Floor is engaging and intriguing. The first-person narrative with short sentences and a strictly linear plot make for fast, enjoyable reading, and the setting (small-town Georgia) seems familiar enough to put the reader right into the action. In some ways the novel is a formula book (the lone gunman rides into town, identifies injustice, defeats it, gets the girl, and rides off into the sunset), but the writing is good enough that it doesn't matter. Child allows the suspense to build throughout the story and provides a real sense of small-town community, politics, and corruption.<br /><br />The story opens with Jack Reacher's arrest in Margrave, Georgia, for a crime he knows he didn't commit. Right away the reader is treated to Child's evident research as Reacher silently critiques the arresting officers' mistakes in apprehending a man they believe to be a murderer. As the local authorities rush to put together the pieces of what happened outside of town, Reacher must clear his name and then track down the real criminals. Along the way, he teams up with a veteran detective and a beautiful female police officer to apprehend a villain who turns out to be much closer than anyone could have predicted.<br /><br />Killing Floor is exceptionally entertaining, and though it does contain some fairly graphic descriptions of brutal violence (the cover art is a bloody handprint) and a few rather modest sex scenes, there is hardly any foul language, and the overall worldview is one of good over evil and justice for all. It is without question an \\"R-rated\\" book, but it's more like Die Hard than Quentin Tarantino. There's no spiritual content to speak of, but the underlying morality of the central characters could present opportunities for discussion. Highly recommended for readers who can enjoy a thriller with a conscience, set in a purely secular world.als.

B000Q6GXW2|4.0|The plot amazon provides is adequate and there are a lot of reviews that talk about the actual hd-dvd, that's great.  Just want to reiterate what most reviewers are saying, the picture quality is amazing along with the audio.  I saw this at Imax for the first time, and i don't know if it was because it was so packed but I wasn't blown away.  I have 106\\" screen in my theater room and every inch of it the video quality was perfect.  I actually took some pictures of this film from my theater and put it on my profile page.  So, a good movie, one of the best so far in 2007, some of the images are straight out of the horror genre, and there is a ton of action to go along with a visually beautiful film.  I also read of Gerard Butler's grueling workout in Men's Health magazine and actually changed my workouts and did this for a few weeks.  I had to cut the pullups to 20 and the deadlifts to 20 though.  I included the workout from Men's Health's website below.  This was his workout along with sword fighting training for hours and other cardio, most of his day being a workout.  For a Spartan-sized challenge to your daily routine, consider this your new fitness gauntlet:         a) Pullups - 25 reps    b) Deadlifts with 135lbs - 50 reps    c) Pushups - 50 reps    d) 24-inch Box jumps - 50 reps    e) Floor wipers - 50 reps    f) Single-arm Clean-and-Press with 36lbs Kettlebell - 50 reps    g) Pullups - 25 reps         All exercises are done without scheduled rest between moves.

0156027321|5.0|Spoilers    It took me some time to get into this book. I put it down 4 or 5 times, but once I got into it was very enjoyable. The story of Pi Patel, son of an Indian zookeeper who ends up on a life boat after the cargo ship meant to transport him, his family and all the animals from the zoo to Canada sinks. He recounts his magnificent story of survival and wonder. He has incredible adventures along the way which bring him many times to the brink of death only to continually survive using shear will and ingenuity.     Ironically survival instinct and hunger overcome any Indian vegetarian lifestyle. It's now kill or be killed. He himself became and much more readily understood the animals he'd observed in the zoo from childhood.     I just finished this so I'm still digesting all the symbolism and trying to make out the meaning of this story, but I'd just like to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00007AJF9|3.0|I gave it only three stars because I bought this as a gift and did not hear a word from the recipiant if they like it. Bad gift.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|I am a huge Wilco fan--- own all the albums, and all the bootlegs etc.--- In my opinion- this band (Tweedy) composes the best music available today.   They are also a tremendous band to see live.  That said- SBS is a let down for me.  It is a good album-- but not a great album.  One of the things Tweedy does well is leave the listener wanting a little more--- he never \\"over-does it\\"-- and doesn't pound the listener with the same melodies and choruses the way most artists do.  However- SBS leaves me famished--- the songs could be so much more.  The melodies are so soft and subtle- that you need to really reach for them- and once found-- they quickly float away.  A couple of other concerns--- the album is very soft-- even the guitar work- which is quite good- is soft-- and the drum work is held back vs. previous work.  Next-- no \\"pop\\" songs.  Though Wilco rarely gets radio play- they have traditionally had tunes that are real \\"toe-tappers\\"--- Late Greats, War on War, Hummingbird, etc.--- there is nothing like that on this record.  At the end of the day- it is a good album--- the songs are still well written and much more interesting than most music being produced today--- but not what I hoped for.
0316067598|4.0|I think most of the reviewers with negative opinions about this book miss the point.  This was a real SEAL mission.  It's amazing that as much of the actual details have been included since their missions are typically highly classified.  For those that have never been in the military, combat operations are typically a lot of boredom and training, and very few experience combat like was told in this story.  Sure, the book could have been written better, what one couldn't?  This book isn't make believe.  It actually happened and life isn't action from beginning to end.  Understanding BUDS and what it means to be a SEAL is key to understanding the amazing story in Afghanistan.    If you've never been hesitant in combat due to the ROE, then  you can't possibly understand his \\"bitter\\" remarks.  There are some that do understand(they've been there) his points on ROE and the media and they must be continually brought to light.  The media doesn't tell the whole story and they don't always get it right.      There are key facts missing from the story, but the author didn't know them at the time, or they're classified.  They did what it took to get the mission done.  Sometimes, you can't take the high ground.  Comms is always an issue.  No one makes perfect decisions in the heat of battle.  Take this book for what it is.  A story of America's best and the sacrifice that they made far from home.  It had to be told.  There are many stories like this from OIF and OEF, more of them should be told so that American's can better understand the challenges facing their Armed Forces.      I can only imagine how painful it was to write this book and relive that terrible experience.  Thank you for sharing your story and honoring your brothers in arms.
B00005JPLW|4.0|Please allow me to sidestep the debate about historical authenticity and concentrate on a few points in the film-making instead.     \\"300\\" marks an interesting convergance point in styles, moods, contrast ratios, color, and computer technology to create a dramatically new and different look and feel to this ancient story of the Battle of Thermopylae. Throughout the movie there is a visceral, masterful, and dark projection of physical power, unyielding will, and personal conviction unto death. These are woven artfully in \\"300\\" into a thrilling, inspiring, and desperate story that keeps you highly-strung with anticipation, even though you've known how it will end ever since you first read the story.    But, even with license given to the Director to distill his revolutionary vision of these events, there was an excessive application of some techniques that hurt the movie for me:    1. Far too much use of slow-motion action scenes. I struggle to think of one action scene that was filmed in \\"normal\\" time. And sometimes, the slow-motion scenes were intercut with \\"fast-motion\\" moments that made the effect even more distracting. The rock music vignettes, which were mercifully few and short, added nothing to a soundtrack that was otherwise very good.     2. The unrealistic looking man-creatures didn't enhance or improve anything. Fortunately, there wasn't too much of this, either, but it definitely cheapened the effect of a genuine battle when these things appeared. The battle was shocking and electrifying enough on its own; it didn't need these over-the-top contrivances.    3. Xerxes! Who in the world could possibly want to portray mighty Xerxes in such a ridiculous manner with this laughable, contemporary appearance?  Look at every single statue, carving, bust, and painting of what artists through the centuries have thought Xerxes looked like and none of them remotely resembled the funny-looking guy in this movie.  With his shaved head draped with pieces of jewelry, and his face punctured with rings and other decorative metal, the only other things he needed to look like a thug-\\"wanna be\\" bottom-feeder in the Twenty-First Century was jeans, a pullover, and a backward baseball cap. Xerxes! King of Kings, and a human god, looking depressingly like today's urban dum-dum \\"fashion-setter\\", plucked right off an American city street corner. Clearly, this characterization did not work, even though the actor saddled with keeping a straight face in this part, Rodrigo Santoro, did a truly great job considering what he had to work with.      All this said, if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you enjoy a heart-pounding ancient war epic, I recommend this movie to you. It was great to see and hear the voice of David Wenham again (\\"Faramir\\", in Lord of the Rings). Vincent Regan, as \\"Captain\\" provides as powerful and as emotionally-charged a supporting role as you'll ever see in a movie of this kind. Even with its faults, I mostly enjoyed the movie, and I admired the concept of a band of brothers who would fight to the death against a tyrant, and that's the true meaning of Thermopylae, in any depiction.
B000OONQBM|3.0|I'm shocked that a film that was made in 1979 still looks brand new today. High Definition certainly does this film justice. But also, so many films these days rely heavily on special effects, and The Warriors doesn't. Yes, it involves a lot of running, but it's very simplistic, and that makes it stand out from films today.<br /><br />Can you imagine if some idiot director came along, and decided it was high time for this to have a remake? I reckon it would awful.<br /><br />I knew nothing about The Warriors before watching it, and was gripped from the beginning. I loved the fact that in this director's cut, the new intro is included (bit of history for you guys out there) and the comic book effects (outlines at the beginning & end of scenes - sorry, I don't know the technical term for it) are excellent, and add a certain something to the movie.<br /><br />Basically the movie is all about a group of gangs. I'm sorry, let me rephrase that - a BIG group of gangs, one of which gets accused of killing the big main man, who wanted to unite all the gangs. So all the other gangs are trying to get their revenge, and chase the main gang (funnily enough, called The Warriors) back to their turf. Where they can't touch them. There's probably well over 100 gangs in this, from all five points from New York, and each has their own 'turf'. Go into a rival's turf and you would expect not to walk another step. It's like in Scotland these days, you're not allowed to wear football strips into certain pubs. Honestly. Some of the gangs are featured in the film and some are not. My favourite was the Baseball Furies, mainly cos they scared me so much! All the gangs listed are: Alleycats, Amsterdam All-Stars, Baseball Furies, Black Hands, Blackjacks, Big Trains, Boppers, Boyle Avenue Runners, Charlemagnes, Colt 45's, Dealers, Delaney Rovers, Dingos, E Street Shufflers, Easy Aces, Electric Eliminators, Eighth Avenue Apaches, Fastballs, Fifth Street Bombers, Filmores, Firetasters, Five Points, Gerrards, Gladiators, Go Hards, Gun Hill Dancers, Gramercy Riffs, High Hats, High Rollers, Homeboys, Hoplites, Howitzers, Huks, Hurricanes, Imps, Jesters, Jones Street Boys, Judas Bunch, Jupiters, Knockdowns, Knuckles, Lizzies, Locos, Magicians, Meatpackers, Moonrunners, Napoleons, Nickel Steaks, Nightriders, Ninth Avenue Razors, Orphans, Panzers, Phillies, Plainsmen, Punks, Queen's Bridge Mutilators, Real Boys, Red Hook Shooters, Roadmasters, Rogues, Romans, Runaways, Saracens, Saratogas, Savage Huns, Shanghai Sultans, Southern Cross, Speedwagons, Stevedores, Stilletos, Stonebreakers, Terriers, Turks,  Turnbull AC's, Van Cortlandt Rangers, Warriors, Whispers, Xenophones, Xylophones, Yo-Yo's, Youngbloods, Zodiacs, and finally, the Zulus.<br /><br />My main quibble about this movie is how none of the stars went on to bigger & better things. Michael Beck (Swan) particularly. At first he reminded me of someone, but I've figured out that to me, he looks like a mixture of Peter Green, young Keanu Reeves & Johnny Depp. It's the whole chiselled cheekbones and strong jawline. Hubba hubba. I'm a sucker for those. He could have done so well in the movie world, but he just seemed to disappear without a trace, according to his IMDB profile.<br /><br />The other good thing about The Warriors, is the amount of running the actors have to do. Read here VERY FIT!!! And the actual Warriors seem to be mostly topless apart from a waistcoat. Guess the other reviewers didn't pick up on that. It must have been exhausting to film.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend The Warriors as it seems to be a small cult classic, according to some reviewers.

B000QXDED6|4.0|Those expecting an historical treatment of the Spartans at Thermopylae will be lost or frustrated or angry at this treatment.  It comes from a graphic novel (comic book) dramatization using the story as a base.  A few of the elements in this telling do have an historical basis.  But not much.<br /><br />Is it a fun movie?  Well, it is tremendously bloody.  I am not a slasher movie fan, so I have not a clue how it ranks on the Red-Rain-O-Meter of popular culture, but it is easily the bloodiest thing I have scene beyond the first 30 minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\",  but here - it is for the entire movie.  Here when blood isn't spurting and limbs aren't flying it is the exception.<br /><br />Some have complained that the movie doesn't capture how harsh the Spartan culture really was, and that is true.  The story does not show the huge numbers of slaves kept by the Spartans, and it does imply that Spartan husbands and wives lived together as we do today in America.  Think barracks and you will be closer to the truth.<br /><br />Along with the blood and the nearly naked men running around in capes and leather briefs, we do get three scenes with nudity and two of those are sex scenes.  There is also an extended scene of creepiness inside Xerxes' tent of pleasure.  However, there is much tougher stuff in the movie.  This isn't for kids.  Still I enjoyed Queen Gogor's treatment of Theron at the council.  It is quite satisfying and not overdone.  If more of the movie had been along these lines I would have appreciated it even more.  (Theron is a fiction, by the way.)<br /><br />While some have complained about the nine-foot Xerxes, the outsized Rhino, the scene with elephants about the size of those in Lord of the Rings, and the monster wolf, I understand that the story is going after telling the tale in a way that would seem as odd and miraculous as the telling might have been in ancient Sparta.  They did not and were not going for any kind of objective realism and such animals would have seemed spectacularly odd to them.  Xerxes with his vast army would have seemed much larger and different than anything they had ever seen before.<br /><br />Still, in the end, this is NOT a serious treatment of the events at Thermopylae.  It is a bloody film that is fun to watch if you are in for that sort of thing.  It has some amazing effects.  I kind of enjoyed its lack of realism.  All of the characters and their settings to look like a graphic novel or bloody video game come to the big screen.<br /><br />This isn't a bad movie, but its hyper violence left me cold.  The fighting is unrealistic, but dramatic.  It is amazing that a few thousand Greeks (not just 300) held off the vast army of Xerxes for even three days.  That is an inspiring story and to the extent that is here, the movie works very well for me.  If you enjoy blood, sex, and comic books, this movie is for you!cularly odd to them.

B00005JPLW|5.0|An adrenaline-charged rush of fantastically stylish visuals, colossal battles, and gratuitously fulfilling bloodshed, 300 manages to ground itself with enough genuine heart and solemn sincerity to propel itself into epic entertainment not confined only to audiences of masculine design. 300 is the first must-see film of 2007, a mature, visually arresting cinematic fantasy thrill-ride.<br /><br />Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300 closely follows the writer's often historically inaccurate, though unquestionably imaginative, retelling of the extraordinary Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. When messengers arrive in Sparta announcing the advance of the tyrannical Persian ruler Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) must choose whether to surrender or fight for the freedoms of Sparta. Determined to defy the deranged warlord and protect his homeland, but restricted by the inane traditions and corrupt politics halting supported action, Leonidas leads 300 of his finest Spartan soldiers into battle against the massive Persian army. Using cunning strategy, superior combat techniques, and the advantageous terrain of Greece herself, the dauntless Spartans fend off wave after wave of increasingly deadly Persian warriors. Meanwhile, Spartan Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) wages her own battle against traitorous politicians in an effort to send reinforcements to her valiant King and his vastly outnumbered soldiers.<br /><br />While special effects are sometimes forced to drive a film short on story, such is not the case with 300. Miller's story is as compelling as it is entertaining and the effects used to translate his artwork to the screen only enhance his tale of honor and bravery. Superbly adapted from Miller's drawings and Lynn Varley's coloring, the stunning imagery created perfectly captures each panel of art and realizes the unseen action in between. Little is left to the imagination, but few could dream up a more fantastical world. The hyper-stylistic melding of digital creatures, backgrounds, and effects with Miller's characters and Snyder's flair for storytelling create an experience unlike any else. Imagine the slick, kinetic visuals of Sin City combined with the exciting, epic battles in Lord of the Rings, then throw Gladiator-esque soldiers into the mix and you only begin to describe the sensory feast that comprises 300.<br /><br />Masterfully drawing upon the artistic influences of Miller's original graphic novel, the movie also creatively expands upon its premises by adding several characters and events. The subplot of Queen Gorgo's plight against the senate, as well as her defiantly pronounced character to begin with, supplement the bloody bouts of warfare and boast the very reasons the 300 men risk their lives. Extra insanely crafted villains like the Uber-Immortal and Rhinoceros heighten the already incredible adversaries the Spartans faced, and the intensely vibrant visual style Snyder has created often outshines its source material.<br /><br />With so much imagery filling every frame, one might assume character development would lose out to action, but the talented cast utilizes every scene to reveal their characters' intentions and unspoken emotions with fervent vitality. Gerard Butler confidently portrays the noble Spartan King with measured reserve and a powerful, commanding presence; and with both brains and brawn on the battlefield a truly heroic figure is born. Lena Headey exudes an assured sexiness and an authoritative demeanor as the dignified Queen, and even the villainous Xerxes matches his exotically terrifying appearance with deceptively calm delivery and menacing poise.<br /><br />As Frank Miller himself proclaimed, \\"There is no way to tell the story of 300 without being amazingly brutal.\\" And brutal it is. But with vicious crimsons spraying the battlefields while bronze clouds clutch the skies, the spectacular action scenes resemble art more than carnage - and well it should, for this is stylized violence at its finest, a necessity in conjuring the apprehension and admiration required to effectively recount this remarkable tale of bravery and survival in the face of insurmountable odds.<br /><br />I give 300 a \\"10\\" not just because it so flawlessly realizes Miller's vision and expands upon it, or that it so effortlessly entertains with wave after wave of ever intensifying visceral imagery, but because it so adequately lived up to my expectations of displaying in unrestrained glory, abundant slow-motion, and free flowing, gorgeously bloody art exactly what I wanted to see in an epic story recounting the valorous last stand of the world's finest warriors - a feat few other films could hope to accomplish.<br /><br />- Joel Massiecessity in conjuring the apprehension and admiration required to effectively recount this remarkable tale of bravery and survival in the face of insurmountable odds.

B000QXDED6|1.0|I have read about battle of Thermopylae since I was a young boy, and eagerly awaited a movie that would tell the story. This is not that movie. If I can save a single person from wasting their money from seeing or buying this movie.............I will have saved at least one person from the misery of having to watch it. I gave this movie one (1) star becasue they will not allow you to rate a movie with zero (0)stars. I am the type of person that will read a book, or watch a movie once I have started......no matter how bad it is. However, in the case of this movie I had to fast forward through much of the last half to spare myself the pain of watching it all. The graphic violence and sexual content are much more than necessary to tell what is already a great story (many good movies are made without resort to this type of cheapness). The acting is of the poorest quality, the script is bad, and the emotion that should be illicted by such a great story is not to be found.    Several people (in comments) feel I misled myself with my own set of expectations and because I may not have realized this movie was only based on a comic book (which apparently is all that a 'graphic novel' turns out to be. That is all correct. It still does not change the fact that this is a very poor excuse for entertainment. Movies derived from all types of sources are made without being this bad.
B000RJO578|5.0|With a fiendishly witty farce just as scathingly hilarious as its predecessor, the creators of Shaun of the Dead swap zombies for all things action in the wildly creative homage thrill-ride Hot Fuzz. An impressive ensemble of talented actors join Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as they lovingly mock action classics from Point Break to Bad Boys to Hard Boiled. In one of the most intelligently scripted films of the year, buildings explode, clips expend, and cars fly through the air in slow motion as this no-holds-barred kaleidoscope of action leaves no adventure clich&eacute; untouched and no old lady unscathed.<br /><br />Veritable supercop Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reluctantly transferred to the sleepy rural town of Sandford after his unmatched police records and merits have pressured the rest of London's police force to attempt to compete. Finding it difficult to adapt to the overly peaceful community, Angel befriends fellow officer Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a dimwitted policeman who admires the hard-boiled London cop. When seemingly random citizens start meeting with untimely \\"accidental\\" deaths, Angel suspects foul play and sets off to expose a dangerous serial killer and uncover the dark conspiracy surrounding Sandford's tranquil facade - all whilst shooting two guns and jumping through the air.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz pays tribute to every staple of the action film genre, from high-speed car chases and blazing shoot-outs to slow-motion stunts and hard-to-kill villains. Every fundamental is addressed and astutely parodied with several key films in mind. The homage to Point Break and Bad Boys is crystal clear, but the genre-spoofing duo have done their homework - scenes derived from Rambo, Die Hard, Hard Boiled, Lethal Weapon and the Man With No Name trilogy await the action film connoisseur.<br /><br />Reprising his role as the serious character in a bizarrely comical situation, Simon Pegg once again provides plenty of laughs as the take-charge fish-out-of-water who unwittingly becomes involved in the sinister conspiracy at Sandford. Nick Frost also lends a familiar persona, this time as a bumbling police officer pining for the extreme action he sees in movies. Other regulars include Bill Nighy as the London Chief Inspector and Martin Freeman as a desk sergeant. Veteran actor Timothy Dalton appears as Simon Skinner, the devilish manager of a local grocery store, while Rafe Spall and Paddy Considine bring a refreshing sarcasm to the two mustachioed officers Cartwright and Wainwright.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz takes a decidedly R-rated approach to the action, dialogue, and violence, but somewhere between brutal decapitations and roundhouse kicking an old lady in the head comes a sadistically stylish brand of comedy as diabolically entertaining as it sounds. Blood flies as fast as the ingenious jokes and even priests and handgun toting cyclists aren't spared from Pegg's ruthless blend of fuzz and fireworks. Much in the same way Shaun of the Dead tackled its subject with a clever tongue and naïve characters, Fuzz pits Nicholas Angel against the elements of an action movie, though this time he's far more qualified for the job. While the intricate murder mystery furthers the plot along, all the events are really just a methodic build to the explosive final showdown with the bad-guys - a culmination any action movie worth its salt would provide. And what a conclusion it is, with high-octane explosions, insane duels, and fantastically over-the-top stunts that perfectly exaggerate the outlandish beauty of the movies that inspired it.<br /><br />Whether trading zombies for action films is an upgrade in your book, it's hard to deny that Pegg, Frost, and director Edgar Wright have proven once again that they know how to get a laugh. Hot Fuzz is a raucous riot of sharp quips and glorious carnage, bloody battles mixed with cunning caricatures and witty mimicry- a sublime combination not seen since the classic action films it so eloquently parodies.<br /><br />- Joel Massie

But I've got to say I'm really disappointed with this one - I'm with Shana from NY - and in the minority of reviewers.  I find Becky despicable. I consider myself a shopaholic - but I could not stand this main character. All the lies and irresponsibility - she's self-centered and stupid... Somehow manages to know nothing about finance (nevermind her own) - despite working in the business - Even a slug could absorb more information.  I don't know why two of Britain's richest bachelors would be interested in her - she's shallow and uninteresting.  I'm 3/4 through the book and will struggle to finish it.

Here the movie presented uncut and the set includes two documentairies and commentairies by malcom mc dowel and helen mirren.   It also has trailers and never before seen photo gallery but most important it has an alternate pre-release version of the film which includes never before seen footage and this alone is enough to purchace this dvd set.   there is a 210' version of the film which is not included here and this is the only thing is missing here except if the pre-release version is this 210' version so this will be perfect.   All an all this is a set NOT TO MISS and don't forget that caligula IS NOT A PORN FILM despite it's porn scenes. It's A GREAT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE MOVIE.

B000QXDED6|1.0|Is not even in the same league as Braveheart or Gladiator, or even Troy! More like Alexander. Bad acting, lots and lots of shouting dialogue over nothing, the voices of some of the actors were modified and sounded like they were being done by Frank Oz, a boy being stalked by a cartoon wolf, Xerxes looking (and sounding) like a drag queen, heavy metal music added to the soundtrack to keep up the drama level in the interest of post pubescent males, lots of bloodshed but never any blood splattering and staying on the actors since it was digital blood,. Cinematography? What cinematography? The entire movie was shot against a green screen. You could have dropped a dance club background in and the movie would have looked like West Hollywood on Halloween.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Standing tall as one of my all time favorite films and one of the most deserved Best Picture wins of all time, `American Beauty' never loses its impression on me.  I'm forever in awe at its overall magnitude; its presence that is so overwhelmingly absorbing.  From Kevin Spacey's fantastic Oscar winning performance to each and every supporting player the cast is golden and the charisma and chemistry is dynamic and ultimately unrivaled.  What makes `American Beauty' so enthralling and captivating to me is the sheer relatable atmosphere and utter honesty that it portrays.  This is a life not unlike our own, with the same dilemmas and controversies, the same dreams and ambitions and no matter how perfect we think we have things there is always something missing, and sooner or later we're going to have to make a change in order to find our center.  Brilliantly, and I mean that with every fiber of the words very meaning, `American Beauty' fleshes out that very innate desire.<br /><br />The film follows Lester Burnham as he goes through his mid-life crisis, realizing that his wife doesn't love him anymore, his daughter finds him creepy and uninteresting, his job infuriates him; basically that his life in general is far from what he wants it to be.  Through a catalog of events he begins to make serious changes, starting with his growing infatuation with his daughters cheerleading friend Angela.  He begins to work out more, eat better and enjoy a little recreational drug provided by his neighbor's son Ricky.  He quits his job and starts up working at the local burger joint where he can slack off and live life a teenager.  He buys the ridiculously expensive sports car because he wants to and develops an attitude that repels those around him intent on dragging him down.  In essence Lester becomes the man that everyman wishes he could become but lacks the `balls' to do it himself.  Lester is everyman, just pushed to the limit of what any man can take.<br /><br />But this film is far more than just about a single man and his crisis.  Lester's wife Caroline is also going through a bit of a mid-lifer herself.  She's finally come to the realization that she is more than Lester will ever be and she wants, no she needs someone that's a better fit for her.  Lester proves himself a constant embarrassment to her, and his newfound identity is making it difficult for her to function in their life together.  Lester's daughter Jane is pulling away from her parents due to their apparent insanity.  She can't take them anymore, her mothers constant bickering and hysterics, her father's pedophilic lust for her best friend and sudden `cool guy' syndrome.  She distances herself from Angela and forms a closer connection with her neighbor Ricky, a boy who opens her eyes to the real beauty that surrounds her.<br /><br />But both Ricky and Angela themselves offer insight into the growing pandemic surrounding the American public as a whole.  The film effortlessly exposes the common issues that are present in almost every home and exist within almost every human being.  Ricky exists in a household run with a cold fist by his father.  His every move is scrutinized and so he acts out in rebellion by living his life the exact opposite of his father's wishes, albeit behind his back.  Angela is the classic case of girl-hates-self, girl-needs-attention but here she feeds off her characters energy, and most of all Spacey's energy and helps create a character that is in the end so touching and so real.  Her final confrontation with Jane and Ricky is so heartbreaking and her feeling of rejection from Lester is so real.  I actually was moved by her character almost as much as Spacey's.<br /><br />The entire cast, not just Spacey, pull out all the stops here.  Annette Bening is flawless as Lester's controlling and hysterical wife (and I mean hysterical in both of its forms, both hilarious when needed and outrageously dramatic when needed).  Thora Birch is also dynamic as Jane, and Wes Bently brilliantly captures his characters unique outlook at adolescence.  Mena Suvari though really stood out for me as Angela, as did Chris Cooper who plays the domineering and controlling father effortlessly.  Peter Gallagher also develops a nice supporting character, although he comes off more as a cameo, and that's hard for me to acknowledge since under normal circumstances I find him nauseating.  Here though he is fantastic, both charming and endearing while equally repulsive and condescending.  How he manages to pull that off is beyond me.  Each and every actor here benefits greatly from the brilliant script, that's for sure.<br /><br />So, in closing, `American Beauty' is everything that is beautiful about American cinema.  It's engrossing, entertaining, refreshing but most of all moving and emotionally investing.  I often battle my feelings about Spacey's win only because the competition that year was so steep and I feel Crowe gave the performance of a career, but every time I watch this brilliant film I'm reminded of why he deserved his win.  He was so invested, so grounded in Lester that he created one of the most likable sinners of all time, a man who we grew to love and embrace despite his faults.  `American Beauty' will always be one of the most deserving Oscar winners to date and will be remembered every time we look in the mirror.captures his characters unique outlook at adolescence.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|I saw that no one had reviewed for awhile so.......this is one of the best live albums of all time.  UFO rocked live and everything about this record is superb.  The guitar solos are unreal, and I have always thought that the solo on \\"Only You Can Rock Me\\", was one of the best pressed on vinyl and the live version though varying slightly, is equally as brilliant.  If you like melodic live/rock, don't second guess, just buy it.
B000RJO57I|5.0|I didn't have to watch this first to know that it was going to be a great movie! I absolutely LOVED Shaun of the Dead, so I knew I'd enjoy this one too. Shaun of the Dead was one of those movies that was so good that you couldn't just write it off as a fluke... The acting was great, the jokes were hilarious, and despite it's name it turned out to have it's own story, not just a spoof of Dawn of the Dead. So the first day this came out, I bought it right away knowing it would be great, and indeed it was! (Wish I could say the same for 300...*Sigh*)<br />There's no comparing it to Shaun of the Dead, it's an entirely different story with a different kind of humor, but I loved it just as much as Shaun of the Dead, and I'm glad I bought it before it sold out!<br /><br />If you liked Shaun of the Dead, then buy this movie! They're not really anything alike, but Nick Frost & Simon Pegg are the same funny, mismatched pair as they were in Shaun of the Dead! With Pegg as the straight-laced by-the-book model Police officer, and Frost as the bumbling side-kick who loves American Police action movies, and wants nothing more than to get into car chases, gun fights, and every other staple of American Police action movies that he just can't seem to fing in his small town.<br />If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead, then buy that too!<br /><br />If you like this movie you may also want to watch:<br />\\"Rush Hour\\"<br />\\"The Naked Gun: From the files of Police Squad!\\"<br />\\"Police Academy\\"

B000RJO57I|5.0|The delirously funny crew that brought us comic zombies in SHAUN OF THE DEAD take on action movies in this clever film featuring marvelous performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who investigate a series of bizarre accidents in quaint little Sandford. Pegg is certain they are really murders, and with Frost at his side, he finds out he's not wrong at all.<br />The dialogue and situations are original and witty, and the movie is surprisingly graphic in its violence, but hey these are guys who gave us lots of blood in SHAUN!  The supporting cast is wonderful featuring nice bits from Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Billie Whitelaw.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than SHAUN!
0953104907|5.0|I wanted to build an electric guitar mostly from scratch and I had a limited budget.  I was pretty sure than I could do it without a book and I probably could have. But I wanted to make sure I wasn't forgetting something important and I wanted the advice of someone with experience so I could avoid any unneeded heartache. After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I picked out this book.      I made a very good choice. I started and completed my guitar and this book helped point out at least a half dozen things I hadn't thought of.       I've since read or looked through maybe 10 more books on the subject, and I'm fairly certain that I couldn't have made a better choice.  There are more comprehensive books out there, sure, but if you've already got a good idea on how it needs to be done, and you just need a little more info, this book is perfect for you. Also, the rest of those books are boring for the more entry level types.       Melvin gives solid and clear examples, and gives you room to fudge things should you need to.       My only problem with this book is that, other than looking up a spec or something, the author does such a good job explaining everything that you don't really have the urge to reread it.       Like I said, I've since read more books than I care to on the subject of building an electric guitar but this is the book I would and have recommended to the the rare person who asks me if I think they can build a guitar from scratch.      Okay so, no one has ever asked that. But hopefully those of you with friends might guess what I'm trying to say.
0788815490|5.0|Not being a fan of Helena Bonham Carter, costume dramas, or Henry James, I purchased this DVD because it featured Venice.  Now I can't wait to see it again.  I was completely riveted.  The growing sense of tension,as Kate manipulates circumstances to suit her own ends, and then becomes a victim of her own maneuvering, is hard to shake even several days after I saw the movie.      I did not feel the sex scene at the end was gratuitous or jarring in any way. In fact, it made complete sense.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with the possible exception of Elizabeth McGovern as Millie's companion - she really didn't have very much to do.    This is also a very beautiful movie - costumes, scenery, and in the words of Indiana Jones, \\"Ah - Venice!\\"
0399237720|5.0|This book is the best edition of this story that I've ever seen.  It's really big, with board pages that are easy for even my 11 month old to turn back and forth.  Plus, the little caterpillar that comes with it is great to use to make the story interactive.

B000OPOANE|5.0|Up until Snakes & Arrows on DVD MVI my entire RUSH catologue was on vinyl.  I like this format!  I prefer the DVD-Audio format but it seems to have died (at least for rock & rollers).  The surround mix on this disk is incredible.  By incredible I don't mean psychedelic effects with dizzing sounds spinning all around you.  By incredible I mean an ambience was created that makes you feel like the musicians are in the room with you.  The video was very cool - My how my RUSH buddies have aged . . . as have I.  I would rate the RUSH albums I have like this, 1. Moving Pictures 2. 2112  3. A Farewell to Kings 4. Snakes & Arrows 5. Signals - and then the rest.  Hope this reveiw is of some help for you.
0743289684|5.0|Hirsan Ali grew up in a Somali family tied to generations of tradition which is very alien to most of us in the west.  She tells of her family's many moves around Africa, the Middle East and then Europe as the Somalia they knew self-destructed in civil war.      Ali's story is fascinating and left me wanting to know more about the motivations and feelings of her grandmother, mother and sister.  Ali reacts to her life in a way that is fairly understandible to me, moving eventually to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage to a stranger and leaving the her Islamic faith.    I am haunted by the lives of the women who remain behind (or have died).  I find the other women in her family are the ones most fascinating and the least understandible.  They do not feel the same need for change or escape, even when faced with female genital mutilation and severe social strictures.  There are glimpses of what motivates them and keeps them tied to the life they have known, including the upbringing that dictates that children learn their family lineage back many generations.  Ali tells their story as much as her own.      But the story does not end with her \\"escape\\" to Europe.  She is eventually pursued and hounded out of the Netherlands by Islamic extremists.  Ali shows us the problems with Islamic culture as transplanted to Europe and the often ineffective ways we deal with Islamic refugees.    This is a fascinating and disturbing portrayal of what life is like for many Islamic women and girls in Africa.   Even more frightening is lengths to which may in the Islamic culture will go to track down and destroy those who oppose them.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Whoa this c.d. is sick. If you like Motograter and Ghost Machine this c.d. will blow you away. Every song is catchy, melodic and fast paced. Easily one of the best metal c.d.'s of the year. Go pick up this c.d. if you like bands like Devildriver, All that Remains and such. It would be major if they could add a bit more weird sounds like the Ghost Machine albums but nonetheless this c.d. still rocks HARD!!
0143036556|5.0|This is a brilliant book that may change many minds radically about the concept of economic development. Unfortunately, many influencial economists and politicians that determine the destiny of our ever deteriorating word are almost totally ignorant of nature. They think development solely in terms of human production and dollars. Wrong! Don't forget the nature. Nature is our prime producer which produces clean water & air, solar energy, mild climate, fish in oceans, soil for agriculture, inspiration for beauty and fine arts. What's the use of luxury motorcars and notebooks if you lack clean water and pure air? We as human beings have a future only if we can live peacifully with nature and control our population.

0618526412|5.0|Having read my first Carson McCullers novel, \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\"(being, incidentally, her first as well), I cannot believe I did not manage to read her books earlier, only now, on the wave of my interest with American South. I have just discovered amazing prose in a perfectly structured novel with great characters and about things of importance. It is also hard to believe that she produced this kind of book at the age of twenty-three, because it is a work of a mature writer, insightful and deep. Unsurprisingly, the novel was a great success and gave fame to McCullers, who continued writing despite her desperately difficult life (alcoholism, bisexuality, suicidal husband, divorce, remarrying her husband who finally managed to commit suicide, numerous strokes, rheumatoid fever, breast cancer and, finally, death at fifty) and successfully become one of the most significant writers of the South.<br /><br />\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is all about characters and setting in time and space. The action takes place in a small town in Georgia, before the United States joined World War II. The central figure is John Singer, deaf and mute, who after his Greek friend's confinement to the mental hospital rents a room in the boarding house run by the Kelly family. John has a unique quality: he attracts lonely people who need to open their hearts and express their ideas. There are four such people revolving around him. Mick Kelly, the daughter of the landlords, is a teenager, who struggles with her desperate need to create music. She feels the notes, sees them and has no idea how to pour her visions of symphonies and concertos on paper, having no education, no musical instrument and no perspectives - her big family is poor, she needs to take care of the younger children and to start earning money to help her parents... Her hopes and dreams seem to be in vain, although I like to think she ended up like McCullers, managing to find the outlet for her creativity. Doctor Benedict Mady Copeland, a black physician, whose hopes for his own children's education and success in life had been shattered, and dreams of achieving the complete freedom for African-Americans remained unfulfilled despite his preaching, is sick with tuberculosis, but still goes about helping his patients, until his illness, overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and disappointment kill him. Jake Blount, a raging alcoholic, migrant worker who longs for the revolution of the working class, tries to convince people to follow the teachings of Marx, and at some point enters in a great discussion with Dr. Copeland, which shows the disparity between white working class and black community and the rift where both should be united for their success. Both Jake and Dr. Copeland get very passionate about their ideals, they can enter into ecstatic states nearing madness, just thinking and talking about their plans and visions. Finally, Biff Brannon, the owner of the New York Caf&eacute;, who is doing well in his material life and is a good, compassionate man, but feels unexpectedly lost after his wife's death and develops a gentle, secret love for Mick.<br /><br />Each of the four characters is drawn to Singer, they like to talk to him and feel as if they are very close; despite his deafness they sense in him the friendly soul. Singer, in fact, seems to personify the God figure, nobody knows much about him, but all feel good to confide in him without any doubt or mistrust. The town inhabitants concoct the improbable stories about Singer, who becomes a legendary figure. The most interesting point is that nobody notices or is willing to explore his troubled soul - he is very unhappy after the loss of his Greek friend and his friendship is full of sacrifices and suffering.<br /><br />Each of the characters, individualized, but at the same time representing different social groups, wrestles with the acceptance of their fate or with the disagreement with the world they live in. Theirpersonal fights may look small and insignificant, like small dramas without heroism, but each of these characters is devoured by the internal fire, impossible to extinguish. McCullers' great writing talent makes each sentence of her novel burst with monumental strength, lyricism, sadness, mystery and magic of everyday human problems, and shows the perspective of life in the first half of the twentieth century in a small town in the South of the United States.<br /><br />This novel is mainly about characters and social situation, with excellent background. Although there are several excellent dramatic events (Bubber's gun accident, where Baby is wounded, or Mick's discovery of sex with Harry, or Jake's involvement in a fight at the fairground) the plot is virtually non-existent, the whole novel is a fragment of reality, a cut-out of the life of the town. The language is simple and clear, yet precise and perfectly grasping all the nuances of the characters, places and situations.

006056251X|4.0|While the second book (It Happened One Autumn) to this quartet still holds the number spot on my book shelf...this one does come close! It was a pleasant surprise to see the author include characters from her other novels (characters like Derek Craven, Ivo Jenner...).  It did not click in my mind that Evie was the daughter of Ivo Jenner... the same Jenner that I read about in \\"Dreaming of You\\", who was also portrayed as the antagonist in that book.  He was mentioned in the first book of this quartet, but not until this particular book did it all come together...and it was quite a delight!     I also loved the story itself...I was never bored with this book.  It wasn't as funny as the second book, but I liked how Evie and Sebastian bickered playfully.  The characters were great...Evie finally developed into an outspoken little vixen and Sebastian was able to give his heart to a woman he least expected!  I loved the passion and the excitement and of course the re-appearance of the other wallflowers- esp. that little scandalous scene with Daisy.  I can't wait to read the 4th book!  I'm starting it tomorrow.    I definitely reccomend this book...fantastic and splendid to the core!
6305910340|5.0|This movie tells the story of Josh Waitzkin and it is based on the book with the same title written by his father. If you have read the book, you will certainly notice that the adaptation for the movie was flexible and does not really follow he facts, but it sure does make the story more exciting.<br /><br />The film starts at the time after Bobby Fischer withdrew from the international chess scene and went into seclusion. After winning his title, Fischer had many disagreements with FIDE (International Chess Federation) and  did not show up to defend his title against Karpov. As a result, he lost the title and left a huge crowd of fans, that had taken up chess after and American defeated the seemingly invincible Soviets, without a hero to carry their flag.<br /><br />In this setting we find small Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), who picks up chess from watching people playing in the park and soon shows his innate ability for the game. His parents soon find themselves in unfamiliar territory and have trouble coping with the requirements and stress even young chess players face. In an effort to help their son cultivate his gift, they contact Bruce Pandolfini, one of the most recognized chess coaches in the US (if you go to a bookstore and look for chess books you will see several written by him).<br /><br />This is when the search for Bobby Fischer within this child begins, and the journey could not be better. Kingsley, Mantegna and Pomeranc are all very good in their roles and give their characters with the right amount of emotion and passion. But if I had to pick a performance, it would be the one by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a character that will remain imprinted in the memory of all those that watch this movie.<br /><br />The fact that Pandolfini is presented in a slightly negative light, compared to reality and the modification of the end of the story do not really detract from the overall quality of the production. If you love chess, this movie is a must, but even if you do not, I bet you will really enjoy it.ll really enjoy it.

B0002OERI0|3.0|Ok I know 90 percent of Americans hate Bush with a passion, but to create a whole CD to emphasize that is rediculous.    I started to listen to Green Day a year before this album came out and I was impressed with what I heard.    I anticipated this new CD since Green Day had been in the shadows for so long and what came out of it disappointed me.     Their old music was dark and punk. This new stuff was too \\"pop\\" for their taste.    My Recommendation:    If you don't like political music, then pass up on this CD.

This book really tests the boundary between real and sci-fi. However, you will fall in love with the main character, the dog. I won't say much more other than the fact that he has super human intellect.    My Recommendation:    If you are new to Dean Koontz, then this is probably the one you should read first.
0385522401|2.0|On Chesil Beach tells the story about the wedding night of a young couple, and is set some decades ago.  In the process it also describes their courtship and it goes on to tell the ultimate outcome for these characters.    The book is well written and quite brief. Thankfully.  I would have no major problem with this story if not for the fact of the way the book is promoted - a tale of how something done or not done can change your life.  This may be so in some cases but certainly not in this story.    This is the story of a young couple who misread their feelings for eachother, got married and let one small incident kill their alleged commitment to eachother. Clearly trust was lacking, love was lacking, and commitment was absolutely lacking. What they have in spades is love of the fantasy in their head. End of story.      It is a failing of the book that the ultimate outcome is not placed in a useful context.  Rather the book encourages some rather strange conclusions about the relationship.  On the one had it is reported that the woman was provided with a book that explained in some detail, everything she could expect on her wedding night from the physical point of view, and even provided tips on what to do.  Her peer group are also reported as not at all prudish.  Yet this woman is overwhelmed by revulsion at the entire idea of sex with her husband, and in the face of hints that this might be a temporary situation, she makes the choice to excise physical intimacy with this man from her life.  Clearly she is with the wrong partner, yet the author draws the conclusion that she is in love with him, but somehow stunted in her sexual life, and self sacrificing in her proposed solution. Similarly the personal growth of the man is implied in his realisation of her loving self sacrifice on his behalf.  It is totally ridiculous. Even if you could stretch belief to accept that this is how the characters perceived the situation it is certainly unhelpful to the reader to suggest that this is the lesson to be taken from this story. Love is evidenced in practical action, not self indulgent yearnings decades later.      As it happens I have a cousin to whom this very situation occurred. Married the wrong woman for the wrong reasons, the specifics of which do not need to be discussed here.  He divorced her a couple of years later when she persisitently refused to consumate the marriage. He went on to a very happy union that produced 5 children. She also didn't pine indefinitely.  She went right out and got pregnant by some other fellow.  She had something to prove.    All in all a very unsatisfying book, that provides no useful insight for life, and ultimately seems lacking in any real insight to the motivations and responses of the couple under discussion.  A silly book about silly people, by an author that would appear to have no actual experience of such situations.
0321344758|5.0|As a graphic designer for over ten years I paid little attention to the conventions of web site design and definitely not the SEO end of it. Krug's book has opened my eyes to the importance of keeping it simple and identifiying the \\"visual rhythm\\" of a site and even more so the importance of a consistent structure.     All too often designers want to do something different but if it's a product or service you're trying to sell, you're doing that business a disservice by making it difficult to process visually and intellectually. When using the web people \\"thin slice\\", (Malcolm Gladwell's book \\"[[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]\\" delves into this topic of the immediate perceptions of the brain) they know what it is that they're looking for, want the quickest route to it and know at a glance if they've found it.     Today's website is \\"the new business card\\". That first impression is possibly the only one you'll make, so make it your best. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is creating websites or having one designed.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I have been a casual Johnny Cash fan for about 5 years. So I can assure you as a casual fan that this CD had to earn all five stars out of me. I wish I could have given it 10. What struck me the most was the passion in Johnny's frail, course, yet emotionally pleasing voice. You feel like your right there in the room with him. After listening to this CD you feel like your saying goodbye to an old friend. The CD feels like a right of passage for Johnny. Most of the songs are covers, but he makes them his own (which shows just how in touch he was musically). When you listen to this CD Johnny will take you on a tour of his heart. I especially loved the songs \\"Help Me\\" and \\"I came To Believe.\\" This CD left me humbled, and sad to lose a close friend I never knew I had.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I first heard Sara Bareilles in New York City, where she was opening for Britpopper Mika at the Gramercy Theatre. I was instantly blown away by her throaty, full voice and right-to-the-point lyrics. I bought the sampler she had available at the show (which consisted of \\"Love Song,\\" \\"Bottle It Up,\\" and \\"Gravity\\") and played it over and over again.    Although my expectations for this CD were relatively high after having listened to the sampler so much and having heard a decent amount of the rest of the album live, they were all met and then some. Comparisons with Fiona Apple and Norah Jones are inevitable, as the female singer-songwriter-pianist genre is fairly constrained, but while Sara may not be an instant superstar, as the other two were, her sheer talent is certainly comparable. Her voice, while a bit more on the conventional side than the other two, is powerful and has a great range, and her songs convey just as much emotion without some of Fiona's melodrama.    A definite buy, especially at Amazon's price of $8.99. My favorite tracks are probably \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Vegas,\\" but there's not a clinker on the album. Couldn't recommend it more!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara B. definitely has one of the most amazing voices!  I first heard her when she was a student at UCLA performing at Spring Sing, a huge talent show near the end of the year, which she won and was absolutely blown away by her voice, well everyone was.  Her voice has this richness and great vibrato that's just right.  Her voice never sounds pushed or forced either.  And then when I heard she signed with Epic and was coming out with a new cd well I got so excited because now she can share with the world her amazing gift and talent!
B000RJO58M|5.0|I bought both 300 and Hot Fuzz on HD DVD.  I enjoyed both, but Hot Fuzz is the better movie.  It has excelllent video, excellent audio, excellent extras, and most importantly--it is an excellent movie.  I can not praise it enough.  If you have friends who have never seen a movie in HD, show them this one.  Yes, I know it can be fun to show impressive scenes from various different movies, but in reality most people want to see an entire movie.  This is now the one to show them!

0385340559|5.0|\\"Two against seven or more. No time. No element of surprise. A fortified position with no way in. A hopeless situation. 'We're good to go,' Reacher said.\\" - from BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE<br /><br />In my review of Reacher's immediately previous adventure, [[ASIN:0440241030 The Hard Way (Jack Reacher Novels)]], I gave 3 stars and opined that author Lee Child had his hero on R&R. But here, in BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE, Jack is teamed with three of seven former members of the special operations unit that he commanded years before as a U.S. Army Military Police officer. Why only three? Because the other four have been tortured and thrown out of a helicopter high above California's Mojave Desert by villains unknown. Back in their service days, the eight of them had been like family, and Jack and his surviving colleagues are on a mission of vengeance. Ohhh, yeah, are they ever.<br /><br />The thing I like about the Reacher series, unlike another which I read religiously but whose heroine (with a pet hamster and initials S.P.) is in an unchanging plot and character rut, Jack is constantly evolving in the perception  of the reader. For instance, in this installment, Jack reveals himself to be a mathematics adept and the club sandwich as one of his favorites. He likes to pick his teeth with the frou-frou toothpick that holds the sandwich together.<br /><br />As an aside, one of Jack's team, present and past, is ex-sergeant Frances Neagley, who appeared, as I recall, in one other Reacher thriller some years ago. Frances is perhaps just as deadly and efficient as her old CO. She also has a violent aversion to being touched. A character as interesting as hers deserves her own series. Lee, are you taking notes?<br /><br />My only quarrel with the plot came towards the end when four Bad Guys are searching a perimeter fence for signs of entry by Reacher and Neagley. It's a moonless night, almost pitch black, and the searchers have no flashlights. While that makes it easier for Jack and Frances to do their bloody work, it makes no sense from the opposition's point of view and strained credibility.<br /><br />The ending to BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE alone is worth the full hardcover price and the five stars I'm awarding. It's perhaps the best in the entire series so far. Yup, Jack is back.t makes no sense from the opposition's point of view and strained credibility.

B000G8NXYQ|5.0|After two deaths at the end of July (Bergman and Antonioni) one more appreciates the revolution in film language, which took place in the 1960s.   Fellini has a different spot in this era of Film-Becoming-Poetry. In near future his dicoveries would be valued no less than Eisenstein's or Vertov's. In many ways Amarcord (and Rome) is more sofisticated than 8.5, which is constructed around plot (last cry of modernism), when the PoMo (late) Fellini is focusing story around thought-feeling, that is a true existential EVENT. Is possible for a requiem to be humorous?   Dante called it \\"Divine Comedy\\" ...    I hardly know any episode that doesn't belong to the poem... I think it is a philosophy piece and, maybe, should be viewed as such.
0192804782|4.0|At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma.  However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters).  Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable.  S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters.  A really great read--if you stick with it.
B000TFINY6|4.0|\\"Lost\\" ended its second season with a bang... literally. The hatch violently imploded, and Kate, Sawyer and Jack were captured by the Others.<br /><br />And so the third season is all about the repercussions of those events. It lags badly in the first half, but shocking predictions and new arrivals on the island add fresh twists -- and some stunning answers -- to the twisty, surreal storyline. But there's still plenty left for the remaining three seasons.<br /><br />Kate and Sawyer are put to work, then locked up in gorilla cages, while Jack is similarly imprisoned inside an Other compound -- and finds that he is there to be a doctor to the sinister Ben, who is suffering from a spinal tumor. Jack finds himself suspended between two Others -- Ben and the mysterious Juliet -- and unsure what to do, or who to trust.<br /><br />The tensions between the Others and castaways become worse as Kate and Sawyer escape, and she mounts a rescue to find Jack. But even when they get him (and the disgraced Juliet) back, things don't improve -- Juliet is secretly spying for Ben, Desmond has terrible visions of Charlie's demise, and the newly solo Locke forces Ben to reveal the island's greatest secret -- Jacob, a mysterious power that commands the Others like a god.<br /><br />Suddenly a woman parachutes onto the island, and tells the castaways that a ship is only a few miles out to sea. As the Others fragment and turn against each other, the survivors decide to take them out once and for all, while Charlie and Desmond set off to infiltrate an underwater hatch. But there will be shocking losses on both sides, as Jack is faced with the most important decision he may ever make....<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" still has plenty of unsolved, unanswered mysteries, and the first half of the season is frustratingly slow and oblique. No answers, at all. But it picks up and answers questions in the second half, including who ruined Sawyer's life, who commands the Others, and the relationship between Dharma Corporation and the Others and why they protect the island so fiercely.<br /><br />The writing for the first half is pretty lax (major questions are answered with non-answers like \\"We watch\\"), but later on it tightens up considerably, with dozens of seemingly unrelated plot threads coming together in the battle with the Others. Locke's dad, Desmond's checkered past, Rousseau's daughter and Sun's pregnancy are only a few of them.<br /><br />But despite all the personal drama (enough about the love triangle!), the stories are still full of gritty action (including Sayid killing a man with just his feet), and increasingly twisted flashbacks that let us see the pre-crash lives of the islanders. These had gotten kinda stale, but Desmond's timeslip makes it seem fresher, as does the revelation of how Ben became King of the Magic Island. It answers a lot of questions too.<br /><br />And there's the occasional loss. Two beloved characters bite the big one in this season, and the handling of their deaths is enough to bring tears to your eyes. But there's some humor as well -- usually provided by Hurley, who revives an old van, triumphs at Ping-pong, and even gets to be the rescuing cavalry. Not to mention the wry, solid dialogue (\\" If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now\\").<br /><br />Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly turn in some solid performances as the increasingly tormented castaways. But Dominic Monaghan and Henry Ian Cusick really rule the acting front, with their poignant struggles with love for their respective girlfriends, and the angst that Desmond's visions bring to them both.

1416523359|5.0|While I have read many of King's books, I've never considered myself a King fan. There are a few that I really liked, The Shining, Dream Catchers, to name a couple. But, Lisey's Story has totally converted me.    Lisey's Story is good for so many reasons. The character development of Lisey and Scott Landon is deep. With his usual economy of words, King has a way of conveying unspeakable horror with one or two sentences. I loved the imagery and the unique phrases and terms used by these characters . . . I'm interested to see if I hear anyone else say, \\"Everything the same,\\" or \\"Bool, the end.\\"    I also was completely engaged in the story of Lisey's grieving process and the extremely intimate relationship she shared with her partner. The book made me take another look at the relationships in my own life.    I bought this book at the airport flying to Acapulco and read the 600+ page book in about four days. I was sorry that it ended. This book had it all, it was a supernatural thriller, horror story, love story, drama . . . I heartily recommend it.

1933784032|2.0|For those who have purchased the series of \\"Art of Star Wars\\" books, as well as \\"Star Wars: Sketchbooks\\" et cetera, this tome is impressive but not novel.  Many photos from those earlier books are reused here.  The problem is that they have been blown up for this larger format.  Consequently, the blown-up recycled photos are slightly blurry.  There are some wonderful photos of star destroyer details that have not been seen before...but is that enough to merit this huge new book?  That decision is up to you, but I expected heretofore unseen, crisply focused photographs.

0790729350|2.0|Reviewer Thomas Thatcher is absolutely correct in every aspect of his review. Younger people ask me about that time (I had the long hair, blue jeans, and Dingo boots, etc.)and I set them straight about things as I see them. Referencing the film, one student found \\"the dialogue and antics of the hippies....\\" to be corny. This documentary on \\"Woodstock\\" is a fascinating cultural artifact but that's about it.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Say what you will about the current Metallica. Sell-outs or not, they knew how to rock in this album. Garage Inc. consists of two discs, all covers of some good, fun songs.<br /><br />Garage Inc. Disc 1<br /><br />Free Speech For the Dumb: It's not a terrible song, but nothing great in my opinion... 7/10<br />It's Electric: It can be a bit repetitive at times, but the lyrics and guitar are fun. 8/10<br />Sabbra Cadabra: Another good song. 8/10<br />Turn the Page: One of my favorites. Hetfield suddenly turns from this devilish man into a singer with a great voice... it shows off his range, and the music is good. 10/10<br />Die Die My Darling: Again, a bit repetitive, but it's a good listen. 8/10<br />Loverman: Nothing special, but not bad. 7/10<br />Mercyful Fate: It's a good song, but it lasts way too long. 7/10<br />Astronomy: Good song, a bit long but it's still good. 8/10<br />Whiskey In the Jar: A fun tune, the lyrics are also good. 10/10<br />Tuesday's Gone: Another very good song, what brings it down is the length. It could easily work as a 6 minute song. 9/10<br />The More I See: It's alright. 8/10<br /><br />Sorry for the somewhat short reviews on that disc, I haven't listened to it as much as... Garage Inc. Disc 2<br /><br />Helpless: A fast paced song, it lasts a while but it's still good and a nice intro to the CD. 8/10<br />The Small Hours: In sharp contrast to Helpless, this song is quite slow. The guitar and bass is very heavy, and Hetfield's voice is much darker. It can get a bit repetitive, but I personally enjoy it. 8.5/10<br />Crash Course in Brain Surgery: A quick song, with good guitar and singing. 8/10<br />Last Caress/Green Hell: Last Caress is one of my favorites on the whole set, simply because of its over-the-top lyrics... I won't spoil it for you. Green Hell, well, the guitar is very fast but it's hard to understand Hetfield and it's frankly boring. As both songs, it gets an 8/10, but rated alone, Caress gets a 9 while Green Hell gets a 7.<br />Am I Evil: A long song, but it changes in speed throughout the song. Interesting lyrics, and pretty nice singing. The guitar is solid. 8/10<br />Blitzkrieg: Good guitar, good singing, a fun song. 8/10<br />Breadfan: It gets repetitive, but the music is good. 7/10<br />The Prince: Somewhat similar to the above songs. 8/10<br />Stone Cold Crazy: These next songs are probably the best on this disc. This is a cover of a Queen song. It's very high-paced, with good lyrics and music. A very fun song. 10/10<br />So What: It's not terrible or anything, and the lyrics are funny the first few times, but after a while it stops surprising you and you sit there wondering \\"So you're swearing. So what?\\". 8/10<br />Killing Time: It's a catchy tune, with good singing and tempo. One of my favorites. 9/10<br />Overkill: It's a bit hard to hear Hetfield in this one as well, but the music is very close to Motorhead's... Lemmy would be proud. 9/10<br />Damage Case: Starting off with a thrash and clash sound, heading into a somewhat repetitive (in the good way) sound with good singing. 9/10<br />Stone Dead Forever: The singing is good, the music is good, it's not too long like Breadfan. The 'sweet long lizard' line makes me smile for some reason. 9/10<br />Too Late Too Late: It's short but sweet. The singing is rapid-fire (not as much as Green Hell's) and the guitar is good. 9/10<br /><br />Now, one might wonder why a set with mostly 9s and 8s gets 5 stars. It's because the CDs are very approachable to anyone who's into harder rock, while still having a Metallica touch to it. Most of the songs can be heard over and over again, and the quality of the covers is great. If you've got the cash, I highly recommend it whether you're a Metallica fan or someone just looking into harder rock.yrics, and pretty nice singing.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|So how long has this DVD been out of print?  This movie has been impossible to attain (unless you live in Brazil) and I think it's about time that this movie is back in circulation.  The movie itself is great simply because of the Queen soundtrack.  The soundtrack is pretty much Brian May rocking out.  Overall, this DVD is definitely a must have for any Queen fans, as well as those who like campy popcorn movies.
B000062TU1|5.0|Since finishing Book 7, I have been re-reading Books 1-6, and also watching the movies in the order they were released. Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is a feast for the eyes, it is beautifully filmed, the special effects are fantastic, and the cast is excellent.<br /><br />The story centers around young Harry Potter who discovers his destiny as a great wizard and goes off to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is played by the brilliant young actor Daniel Radcliffe who seems perfect for the role, not just in looks, but also in his gestures and mannerisms. His best friends Ron Weasley [Rupert Grint], and Hermione Granger [Emma Watson] are perfectly cast as well, and together, these three young actors make the story of Harry Potter's exploits come alive.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well - Richard Harris's Dumbledore reminds me of Gandalf the Grey, he is dignified, and full of wisdom. Maggie Smith delights as the strict Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman truly breathes life into the character of sly, cunning Professor Snape who seems to have a secret agenda of his own. Robbie Coltrane's gentle giant Hagrid is amazing as well.<br /><br />The costumes exceed expectations - truly what one might expect of characters playing wiches and wizards, and the creatures such as the centaurs, dragon etc are fun to watch, as are the special effects.<br /><br />This is a great movie for both kids and adults - a great beginning to the series and truly outstanding in its storytelling skills. The others in the series are amazing in their own right and merit multiple viewings as well.

B000069HK2|5.0|I was lucky enough to be working at Reprise Records when this record came into the door.  I did promotion and marketing for 20 years there, and in came The Used CD.  I listened to it, an it just hurt my ears.  I didn't like it.  I was a Sting and Peter Gabriel fan.  But there was SOMETHING about The Used that made me go back and listen.  Why was this guy screaming like that?  \\"Taste of Ink,\\" was the first single, and the first song I really liked.  The promotional video for Box of Sharp Objects just made you love the guys.  And I started liking more and more songs on the CD.  Finally it was my FAVORITE cd.  Maybe Memories, song 1, which I could not swallow at first now was blowing me away.  This one band changed my taste in music totally.  So I went to see them on their first Warped Tour run in Atlanta, and I have to say it was a life changing experience.  The band came out on this tiny side stage, and Bert BLEW into it.  He started smashing the mike into the floor, and when it came back broken when he swung it back to himself, he shot a bird to the sky.  Like \\"Thanks God for allowing my Mike to break!\\"  It was and AMAZING show.  The raw power had me in a state of shock. I remember looking at the radio guy I was with there and the look on my face was certainly, \\"Do you BELIEVE what is happening???\\"  So, if you don't have this masterpiece, get it!  bj

B00008DDXC|5.0|The second instalment in the Harry Potter movie franchise is an excellent movie in its own right - the story of Harry Potter and his battle against dark forces continue, and the story takes on a darker tinge as the evil that Harry Potter battles begins to develop into a thing of more substance.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe reprises his role as Harry Potter as do Rupert Grint [Ron Weasley] & Emma Watson [Hermione Granger] -all three do justice to their roles, and show some maturing in each respective role, esp Radcliffe. Richard Harris plays Dumbledore, sadly for the last time, as he died, and Dumbledore is played by Michael Gambon after this movie. Kenneth Branagh plays the role of Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a convincing air of vanity, appearing airheaded most of the times, as should be.<br /><br />The effects are even better in this instalment than in the previous movie - the creatures especially Dobby the house elf,the Basilisk, and Aragog, the giant spider are true examples of great CGI effects.<br /><br />All in all, this is a worthy follow-up in the Harry Potter franchise, and a visual feast for the senses.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|Absolute Garbage compiles 18 totally unforgettable tracks together in one nifty pacakage + 13 super remixes. Garbage can't produce a bad song, so I really have no complaints about the track sequence. There've been 'best of' cds with less tracks than this, so, at this price, I say pick one up with they're hot. Too bad there's no CD/DVD combo thingy, cos I haven't seen one video of them yet. Was looking for the Absolute Garbage DVD as an individual item to buy at the same time, but none of the local music stores carry it (yet). Perhaps there's one song that could've been added (Sex is not the Enemy). Don't know why wasn't added. It really gets me moving, especially when I'm on the bike.<br /><br />The liner notes are well-written and thank you, for the lyrics to the songs! Very good move, guys. Disc one is red and the the remix CD is black. Artwork is kept simple yet catchy. I haven't seen most of these photos, yet I don't spend much time on the net looking for photos of Garbage anyway. Shirley & the Boys never cease to amaze me, whether it's their 'in your face' posing & expressions, or their funky shades. I've had the opportunity to see Garbage in Montreal, April 24th, 2005. What an experience!<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent and the songs I believe have been remastered. Housed in a double jewelcase with matte paper outer slipcase, everything is summed together rather well. 13 years of super-great hits spanning the band's career will keep your speakers pumping out continuous ear candy like none other. Go Baby Go!!! The liner notes booklet features 24 pages including front & back covers. All photos are in black & white or greyscale. The \\"Parental Advisory\\" sticker on the slipcase is not a sticker at all, but actually printed on as part of the artwork. This CD is a must for any garbage fan, and should be on your Ipod. Support Garbage by purchasing this item. You won't regret it.
0743496728|5.0|School schootings are uncomfortable ground for adults because by their very nature since they subvert everything we tell outselves about children: that they're innocent, that they are a product of their parents, that they are the future, that they are safe in the hands of their parents and teachers. Picoult confronts all of that in her new novel about Peter Houghton. From his first day of kindergarden Peter was bullied relentlessly by his peers. Some of it was normal: being called names, and some was more extreme: physical violence. Certain occasions were a display of sickening cruelty. Lots of children go through these same experiences and survive them, sometimes emerging as stronger, and more compassionate adults because of the experience. But there are the rare cases where the victim will react violently. So what is this mysterious \\"x\\" factor that makes Peter Houghton bring weapons to school one day, kill ten classmates and wound ninteen more? To answer that question Picoult brings us back in time to Peter's birth, through his early childhood, his first days of school, his one close friendship, his romantic woes, the loss of his older brother. She interweaves this account with what happens in the hours, days, weeks and months that follow the shooting. What we don't see are the ninteen minutes during which the shooting took place. By the time we finally do learn what happened in those fateful minutes it's almost irrelevant. The same people are dead, the same lives are desroyed. Assigning blame is the only thing people are able to do, even though it's ultimately futile.     Blame is a huge issue in this book. Who is to blame for the shooting? Peter is the obvious answer, but what about all the factors that led him to that point? Is is father at fault for teaching him how to use a gun and taking him hunting? Is his mother at fault for constantly comparing him to a sibling? What about the bullies who tormented him every day? Or Josie, the friend who betrayed him forpopularity? Did anyone \\"deserve\\" to die because Peter suffered? Is anyone more at fault than anyone else? It's up to the reader to come to know these characters and form  an answer for him/herself.     People have criticized and praised the final \\"twist\\" at the end. In truth if you look for it, Picoult carefully plants the seeds for the development from the begining and it end up being bitterly ironic that things happened this way. But it ends up being unnecessary in the long run. It's just another shade of grey to add to the mix.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|~~~\\"North & South\\" is a period drama set in the 1800s in both the north and south of England. The story centers around Margaret Hale, a passionate southern belle; John Thornton, a strong-willed northern tradesman; and their respective families.  Margaret has grown up in country Helstone, surrounded by comfort, beauty, and society; now a young woman, Margaret's father decides to move to the north of England - much to the shock of all around him. In the move to the new town Milton, the Hale family comes in contact with the life of industrial mill workers and masters. It is here that we meet John Thornton, a wealthy, handsome, cotton mill owner; but he and Margaret are as far apart as east and west - at least on the surface. Yet the longer the Hales stay in Milton, the more they like it, and the more John and Margaret are attracted to and repulsed by one another; until the excellent ending.          ~~~\\"North & South\\" is a wonderful drama of two people caught in a web of misunderstanding and love. The characters are very much believable and the wardrobe was excellent. The cast is great for the movie; from moodily handsome Thornton, to hardily-built persistent Higgins. Personally, my favorite was Thornton, for he was much more complex than Margaret and a very interesting character.         ~~~The setting of Milton might be a bit dark for some, with no brightly colored backdrop except in London and Helstone, but the characters themselves are very colorful with a very realistic multi-dimension to them.   ~~~There is some issue with cleavage and corsets in this movie, both being in full use. Although most of Margaret's clothing is modest, I wouldn't recommend anyone under 10 years old to watch this movie (also the plot is a little confusing for younger ones).   ~~~Anyway, besides what I mentioned above I sincerely enjoyed this movie!  A lot of people compare \\"North & South\\" to BBC's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" but in P&P the main characters have both pride and prejudices, while inN&S, the line is more clearly drawn.  For, Hale has her own ideas and prejudices against \\"the north,\\" while Thornton has his own pride to deal with concerning his continuing attraction to Hale (just as an aside: Daniela Denby-Ashe was made for this part, she isn't what one might immediately declare as 'pretty', but there is something about her that is very sweet and endearing). Yet it all ends very sweetly after the four hours are up and I will definitely be adding this movie to my own video collection alongside \\"Sense & Sensibility\\", \\"Persuasion\\", \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Emma\\", and \\"Wives & Daughters\\".
B000001F5F|5.0|I still have my original cassette tape of this--my very first U2 purchase.  I adored it, and I adore it, still.  I realize one of the tracks isn't exactly \\"live\\" as they are all labeled, but no matter.  The passion and strength of the songs on this CD stand.  It's brilliant!
1416523359|5.0|Two years after the death of her husband, celebrated author Scott Landon, Lisa (Lisey) Landon finally faces the challenge of cleaning out Scott's study. While doing so, she is forced to face memories of their life together in this world and in another, alternate world Scott would retreat to from time to time, a place he called Boo'ya Moon. During this time, Lisey resists pressure from a professor to donate Scott's papers to his university's library. She cannot be bothered with this; her sister Amanda has gone into a catatonic state over the marriage of her boyfriend to another woman and Lisey needs to find a health care facility for her. Lisey receives a phone call from a man calling himself Jim Dooley, warning her that if she does not donate the papers, he will hurt her. Although Lisey ignores the threat, she soon finds Dooley in Scott's study, where he physically assaults and mutilates her. Recalling Scott's healing trips to Boo'ya Moon, Lisey goes there to mend herself. When she returns, she knows where she needs to take Amanda to cure her mental illness and where Jim Dooley must die.<br /><br />This lengthy story transits from the past to the present and back to the past again, in an entertaining way that keeps the reader engaged and eager for more. Lisey is a strong woman mourning her husband's death who finds herself not only caretaker of her sister Amanda but also the person her family turns to in times of crisis. Reminiscent of King's earlier works, Lisey's Story is an electrifying read, with in-depth characterization and a plot that demands the reader's constant attention.
1593352816|5.0|This book is well written, and gives you enough information to believe the slightly incredible tale. One of the best books I've ever read. I would / do suggest this book to everyone I know.    This book is about a woman and man who are brought together by a genetically altered intelligent dog. There is a wide range of characters who people can relate to, their stories are colorful and entertaining till the end.    On a side note, the book exlains that there were people looking for the dog everywhere. Including all modes of transportation. And that they wanted to stay close to resolve the situation, rather than flee across the country. It keeps together the core characters.
0684830515|1.0|I'm no scholar, no student of literature. I just like to read. Everything from Huxley to HST to Dan Brown... if a book is good, I'll read it. If a book sucks, I'll usually put it down about halfway through.    That's what bothers me the most about The Sun Also Rises. I've heard nothing but good things about Hemingway, how he's the greatest American author of all time. So even though page after page of this book was boring to the point of tears, I kept reading. I gave Hemingway the behefit of the doubt that at some point, SOMETHING other than dinner, drinking, and everyone taking their turn on the neighborhood whore would happen.    Unfortunately, nothing happens. There's no plot, no conflict -- wait, that's not true... everyone hates the Jewish guy and everyone wants to sleep with the same woman... let me clarify -- there's no conflict interesting enough to carry a novel, no interesting characters (everyone is either an alcoholic or a slut, who you'd think might be interesting, but they are really just sad and pathetic), and absolutely no action. I wish I had read something else by Hemingway first, because odds are that ANY book would be better than this one. But now that this is my first impression of him, unfortunately, I don't know if I'll ever pick up another one of his books. It really is that bad.    DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!

B000F3T3E6|5.0|This early allegorical oratorio (written by Georg Frideric Händel at a mere 22 while on an Italian sojourn) already shows the inventiveness of this genius (and one can understand why the composer cannibalised the work for his later compositions).  The libretto is no more than a poetic and moralistic conversation among its four allegorical personae, all individually characterised by the singers all armed with marvellous technique and emotional expression: Bellezza/Beauty (French soprano Natalie Dessay) is fought over by Piacere/Pleasure (Swedish mezzo-soprano Ann Hallenberg) on one side, keeping her enticed with the joys of present \\"superficial\\" and pleasurable pursuits, and Enlightenment/Disinganno (Italian contralto Sonia Prina) and Tempo/Time (Slovakian tenor Pavol Breslik) on the other.  Of course, the libretto having been written by Händel's pal, the Cardinal, Benedetto Pamphili, it's inevitable that the \\"virtuous\\" personae of Enlightenment and Time will win in the end, and Beauty agrees to take on the hairshirt and do penance for enjoying life too much.  And yet, the irony of it all is that the very music Händel wrote for this oratorio will bring such pleasures to its hearers and would likely draw the disapproval of Time and Enlightenment for its \\"corrupting\\" beauty!     The work is performed with spirit and verve as well as sensitivity by the singers, guided by Baroque conductor Emmanuelle Haïm directing her Le Concert d'Astrée playing on period instruments.  Although her over-bright soprano took some getting used to by me, Dessay becomes simply delightful in her very many arias (about nine of them, by my last count), with coloratura passages as in \\"Un pensiero nemico di piace\\", \\"Della vita mortale\\" and \\"Un schiera di Piacere\\", all joyfully rendered and proving of little difficulty for her agile technique. Hallenberg gets to deploy her magnificent, incandescent mezzo in the work's most beautiful and famous arias, including the exquisitely languourous \\"Lascia la spina\\", the courtly \\"Un leggiadro giovinetto\\", and the furious \\"Tu giurasti di mai non lasciarmi\\" and \\"Come nombe che fugge col vento.\\" Prina brings a measure of majesty to arias like \\"Più non cura\\" and \\"Crede l'uom chegli riposi\\", entrancing you with her dark, smooth and warm alto, with some impressive virtuosic runs in the middle of the latter aria.  Finally, Breslik holds his own among the women as the authoritative and father-like chastising figure of Tempo, with his expressive and textured vocal that's hard to ignore, as in his affecting \\"Urne voi\\".  On the ensemble pieces, the singers all blend together superbly, and one can get a taste of that excitement in the YouTube music video featuring the quartet singing the exhilarating \\"Voglio Tempo\\".    Additionally, director Haïm plays a mean organ on several tracks, with excellent sonata-like passages on \\"Taci: Qual sono ascolto?\\" and \\"Un leggiadro giovinetto\\". She's actually made this organ-leery listener more appreciative of that instrument.    This is a most welcome addition to the growing recorded Händel repertoire, and one highly recommended to anyone already a Händel fan, or one just starting to learn about the Baroque master's works.
B000001FA4|5.0|You won't get a negative thought from me about this CD.  I love it.  It's one of the more poetic renderings of a U2 forthcoming.  It's great on its own, but especially intriguing to look back and see how this release was in the middle of a constantly evolving sound.
0792165020|5.0|I'm a huge Matt Damon fan because he is such a versatile actor.  He doesn't disappoint here in The Talented Mr. Ripley.  A+ for the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen with a musical score that is haunting.  I'm giving the movie five stars because to me it was perfect until the very last scene, which felt incomplete and unfinished.  Jude Law more than holds his own against Matt Damon's subtle performance as Dickie Greenleaf, the wealthy dilettante that has the life that Matt Damon's Tom Ripley covets.  The film completely draws you in and you truly feel both Damon's desire and desperation and Law's utter contempt of both of those emotions.  The film also makes you long to be in Europe during that era, to be a part of that time period.  The supporting performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Cate Blanchett and Gwenyth Paltrow are also very strong.  This film truly shows you how the other half lives and what it feels like to be on the outside looking in.

B00005JPLW|4.0|I wanted to look at 300 from a historical perspective.  The story itself is based on the Frank Miller graphic novel of the same name and it stays more true to that than history of course.  In fact, it is a very dedicated adaptation of Frank Miller's work.  After watching 300, in what seemed like a ten minute movie but was almost two full hours, I have to say that I almost prefer this sort of historical fantasy to the historical fiction of Braveheart or Gladiator.  Zack Snyder (the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake) directs and he, like Miller, is entirely willing to elevate the legendary Greek underdogs who inspired a great people to unite against an unstoppable enemy, to exaggerated mythology. It is a film that doesn't pretend to do anything other than entertain it's audience.  I know a Greek guy who, in an snide imitation of the Pope's rumored reaction to Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, says that 300 \\"is as it was.\\"  Keep that in mind while watching and you will see that 300 is quintessentially about bravado.<br /><br />300, if you don't know already, is about the Battle of Thermopylae, which to be brief basically is a battle that occurs as King Xerxes I's massive Persian army converges toward a small force of Spartans led by King Leonidas.  The Spartans block the only road into Sparta.  The battle is perhaps the most famous last stand in history.<br /><br />300 really is an astounding production.  Considering a budget of $60 million, the film looks amazing even though teetering on over-stylized.  Not to suggest that $60 million is a low budget, but consider for a second the cost of Spiderman 3 ($258 million).<br /><br />This movie is constant primal action and it never stops until almost everyone is dead.  It could've easily followed the formula from other similar movies, and it does at times, but for some reason it's fantasy approach and inclusion of giants, monsters, and super-sized animals puts the movie in such a unique frame that it almost gets away with all of the cliches.  It gives you everything you want in a blood soaked action epic.  All things considered, the acting isn't bad either.  Gerard Butler, who plays Leonidas, is actually very good in his role, while at the same time he carries a presence worthy of his character and all of his men who inevitably die beside him.<br /><br />This is a unique film with a visual style that will make it unforgettable.  The action scenes are intentionally like the comic, so the bloodshed depicted in 300 shouldn't really disturb the audience but it is still pervasive.  Because the film is fantasy, Snyder is justified in liberally interpreting how powerful the Spartans were.  They are basically super-human at times.  The shots often slow down to give the audience the ability to comprehend everything that is happening, reminiscent of the iconic and memorable shots from the Matrix.  Mostly though, this is to show how quickly a Spartan can cut a limb off of a Persian before doing it again and again.  Personally, I have no complaints.It gives you everything you want in a blood soaked action epic.  All things considered, the acting isn't bad either.

B000001EAQ|3.0|Not one of their best, IMO, but what are you gonna do?  For me this was nowhere man's land, from a group of artists who are very self-assured and focused.  Listening to it feels like a record label at work.
B000002IST|3.0|Still to Collins influenced {example, I Can;t Dance}, but enough material here to make a decent album. Fading lights is definitly a highlight. Tony hits the mark with an awesome solo every Genesis (not PhilCollins Fan) fan has been hungry for. Also,Driving the Last Spike is another well written lenghty song; even though musically nothing fancy, it is lyrically awesome and sung beautifully by Phil. But why is the song's Hold on My Heart and the ever dreadful I can't dance have to spoil a close to great album.AS I say again- PHIL KEEP YOUR SOLO MATERIAL OUT OF THE BAND> Making a long story short, this album has something for the old and the uneducated Genesis fan. I actually recommend it!

B000P46QIG|3.0|By what criteria do you rate a progressive rock fusion album on steroids? If I was rating this merely on musical skill on display, it would have to be 5 stars.<br /><br />Yes, there is mind-blowing technical prowess on display throughout this album and I laugh at the the sheer audacity of what these musicians present with finesse. I am sure Vinnie and Simon Phillips are grateful they were not invited to play drums on the opening track - for drummers out there - listen with caution - as Virgil kicks serious poly-rhythmic butt! Complexity that most rock drummers wouldn't comprehend, and if this isn't enough wait for the double-pedal speed kick in the final track's extended drum extravaganza!<br /><br />This progressive drumming master class never abates and as much I believed it was Virgil who keeps the excitement going through their live album I hesitantly suggest that there are just too many time changes on every single track and that his compositional style weakens this album. I would have thought that Derek Sherinian, as the awesome keyboardist he is, would have surely been able to at least share 50% of the compositional credits. I would have preferred a variety of compositional styles as the repeated minor motifs that appear in nearly all the tracks make this almost repetitious towards the second half of the album. [Hence my initial award of 3 stars].<br /><br />The second track is the highlight for me and the very different piano approach in the opening bars with the unmistakable touch of Holdsworth's shimmering chords is wonderful. His solo is like most if not all Allan's work - unmistakable tone, breath taking speed and beauty. It is indeed a loss that instead of playing on the whole album, Holdsworth contributes only here and on track 4 with another master solo over an impeccable Donati groove (I loved the openness and space here).<br /><br />What I did note was how similar Derek's keyboard solos sound to Holdsworth; indeed even Garsed's guitaring had tone and approach that approximated the 'noodling' of Holdsworth. One can't help but think what might have been. That's not to say that Brett Garsed's playing is lacking; on the contrary I believe that with not much notice he came to the rescue and pulled out some amazing playing. One does sense though that overall this album is more keyboard dominant and that rhythm guitaring in particular was lacking or so close to the keybooard mix that it's not noticeable.<br /><br />The track 'Poland' has grown on me with each listen and ends with Sherinian's keyboard providing an alien soundscape including dolphin-like cries over which is there is a great Jimmy Johnson bass solo. This stands out as a beacon of melodic light from the dark sheets of keyboard and at times muddy bottom end that permeate through the album.<br /><br />[UPDATED PARAGRAPH-December 2008: When I initially wrote this 3 star review I stated that I wasn't emotionally engaged and that perhaps with time this album would grow on me. Well it certainly has. A year later and I regularly play this album - the 'Alien Hip Hop' opening track is now one of my favourite hard fusion/prog metal tracks of my collection. I'd now give the album 4 stars.]<br /><br />The production and musical standards are high - even the packaging and great cover art make you hold this CD with anticipation and appreciation.<br /><br />This all instrumental album - a hybrid between Dream Theater meets Return to forever on steriods, establishes the unique Planet X style.

Overall, the cd is really great and the musicians are talented.  My only complaint is for the lyrics, since I don't believe in any God, the message is a bit boring to me, but I respect Neil and his thinking as well as anybody who have faith, after all, he is a great composer and his music is just amazing, that's what it is all about !

It's in my all time top 3, and ever shall be. This CD defined the collective consciousness of the musical industry for a decade, catalyzing an audience unprecedented for any other new 80s band, setting a standard no other act has followed.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I hadn't heard much about some Carribbean hottie named Rihanna until her big hit \\"SOS\\" started making waves in the US in 2006.  Though I thought the single was somewhat catchy, but a bit too repetetive for my tastes, her nasally vocal delivery made me cringe and I couldn't get past that annoying quality in her singing.  Being a person who doesn't really listen to radio these days, I just so happened to hear she had a huge hit single on her hands in 2007 called \\"Umbrella\\" so I decided to check it out to see just what made the darn song so catchy.  The first time I heard it, I thought it was just a mediocre R&B dance track with little to offer (the infamous \\"ella ella ella ey ey\\" part was the least satifying part of it for me at first); but with subsequent listens it sounded better and better.  Soon I started playing it repeatedly on my iPod and noticing I was grooving to the bea so I decided to get the album.  Even though Good Girl is far from perfect, its good outweighs its low moments.  Opener and lead international smash \\"Umbrella\\" is, undoubtedly, the highlight here--everything about it, from its beat to Rihanna's refreshingly bubbly delivery--make this track a sure feel good single, worthy of the praise it has received since its release onto the charts.  \\"Please Don't Stop the Music\\" is another memorable tune, more disco and dance than R&B and Hip Hop.  \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" is lyrically jarring as it references a woman discovering her man done did her wrong and how angry it has made her.  Ballads have never been one of Rihanna's strong points (\\"Unfaithful\\" was a beautiful, almost tragic R&B ballad which showcased her oft-questionable singing skills quite brilliantly), but the two real ones presented on Good Girl are quite listenable: closing and title track \\"Good Girl\\" is decent and presents a good message to all those cheaters out there, but it is the smoky \\"Rehab\\", not to be confused with the brilliant Amy Winehouse song, that stands out here as the better song.\\"Lemme Get That\\" sets the mood for the Carribbean flavor Rihanna presented in her debut single, the annoyingly likable \\"Pon de Replay\\", and features a hilarious chorus lyric over the top of its addictive island Hip Hop beat: \\"Got a house but I need new furniture/But why spend mine when I can spend yers?\\"  Rihanna may not have made a perfect listen, but Good Girl is certainly her best album to date and worthy of its success.
0060763892|5.0|I have to admit that I'm a die-hard James Rollins fan.  Cracking open his new book is one of the highlights of my summer.  Sure his action can be a bit over-the-top and a few details slightly hyperbolic, LOL.  I mean, what's a thriller without the thrills?  But the books are consistently well-researched, deftly plotted, and very, very smart.<br /><br />Probably my favorite aspect of Rollins' thrillers is their integration of science into the story.  After all, his team of protagonists, the Sigma Force, is part of a government agency that recruits former special forces operatives and educates them to the Ph.D. level in scientific disciplines.  They've got both the military training and the scientific knowledge to investigate technological and scientific phenomenon around the world on behalf of the US government.  Not a bad starting premise.<br /><br />The plots of Rollins' novels tend to be complex, multi-stranded affairs that are difficult to summarize.  In Judas Strain, as has been noted by other readers, there is an urgency brought on by a possible pandemic outbreak of bacterial infections.  That, in and of itself, is not the most original plot.  But in a Rollins novel, it's never that simple.  Did you know that only 10 percent of the cells that make up your body are human, and the other 90 percent are alien--bacteria, parasites, etc?  It's true, absolutely true.  Did you know that the difference between a commonplace, harmless bacteria and a potential killer disease is just the tiniest alteration to its genetic code?  What would happen if something altered all the zillions of harmless bacteria we have contact with daily and suddenly they turned on us in the most horrific way imaginable?  And I do mean the most horrific way imaginable, because James Rollins is a bit of a sicko, and nothing seems to be off limits for him.  What he puts his poor \\"patient zero\\" through is--yuck--awful!<br /><br />But what does all this have to do with the travels of Marco Polo?  The architecture of Angor Wat?  The behavior of red crabs on Christmas Island?  The development of \\"Angelic\\" text?  The religious beliefs of cannibals?  How the heck does Rollins COME UP WITH all this stuff?  And most impressively, how the heck does he tie all the strands together!  Because he does, most satisfyingly.  Although, it must be warned that The Judas Strain leaves readers with a simply terrible cliff-hanger that will have us all on tenterhooks until next summer.  Waiting for the next book in the series is going to be torture!Wat?  The behavior of red crabs on Christmas Island?  The development of \\"Angelic\\" text?  The religious beliefs of cannibals?

B00005JLIU|5.0|Thoroughly Modern Millie is an excellent reminder of all of the fun of the 1920s in America. It features all sorts of tributes to the era from the style of music, the costumes, homages to silent films, and the overall feeling of fun. The story is silly, but never in a way to alienate its audience. Millie (Julie Andrews) has come to New York to become the stenographer of a rich man and to marry him. She bobs her curls and wears knee length skirts. Soon she meets Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) who has come to New York to become an actress. She has no family or friends in the world, which makes her the perfect target of Mrs. Mears (Beatrice Lillie), the owner of the hotel that Millie and Miss Dorothy stay at. Mrs. Mears is involved in a slavery racket in which she kidnaps young girls with no ties to the world. However, Mrs. Mears has no luck in getting Miss Dorothy, and Miss Dorothy has plenty of time to meet friends including Jimmy (James Fox), Muzzy (Carol Channing), and Millie's boss, Trevor Grayden (John Gavin).<br /><br />This film features standards like \\"Baby Face\\" and \\"Do It Again\\" as well as modern songs written for the show like the title track and \\"Jimmy.\\" However, every song sounds like it was written during the 20s, so each suits the film well.<br /><br />This movie is very long, but that doesn't seem to matter. The performances are excellent, the music fits in very well, and there is constant action. The film never drags. Film makers often have trouble capturing the spirit of an era when doing projects like this one, but Thoroughly Modern Millie is a surprisingly accurate and fresh tribute.

0618680004|4.0|Belief in God is a delusion.  This is the Dawkins hypothesis.  Faith in science -- and check out my Meme theory while you are at it -- is [intelligent] mankind's only true refuge.      This book is necessary; in the same sense that Oliver Cromwell was necessary (see Chapter 10 for a similarly gratuitous but much grosser reference to Oliver Cromwell).  Not a lot of fun, but necessary to the explosion of the old order.  And Dawkins is only too eager to be a bomb-thrower and explode the old order.  But just as no one really loves a bomb-thrower at the end of the day (\\"How did the bomb-throwing go today, Honey?\\"), Dawkins is hard to love.    He does not reserve all bombs for God and religion.  In the last paragraph of Chapter 4 he tosses one directly into the lap of you the reader.  After bushwhacking a series of weaker arguments in favor of a belief in God, Dawkins arrives at the stunning conclusion:   \\"God almost certainly does not exist.\\"  Wait a minute!  Say that again?  God ALMOST CERTAINLY does not exist?  But isn't that the whole point of religion?  If there is any possibility at all, however infinitesimal, that God does exist - how can it be delusional to keep the faith?  To say that God \\"almost certainly does not exist\\" and therefore should be banished, is like saying that Lotto should be outlawed because almost no one ever wins.    Like Cromwell, Dawkins has no sense of humor.  In fact, he possesses only anti-humor.  Not only are his attempted witticisms not funny, they are anti-funny and suck all the fun out of anything within five pages.      He presents himself as an aggrieved member of a discriminated against atheist minority but is either unwilling or unable to offer any evidence of personal discrimination -- other than having his opinions attacked in interviews or when he appears on panels.  So sorry, here sign another book.     He finds no evidence or need to believe in a God.  OK.  He thinks the burden of proof falls on the believer but then is apoplectic to discover that believers feel no need to prove anything.  The reality is that beliefs, rightly or wrongly, do not require proofs; that is why they are beliefs.  Time to move on we say.  But no, Dawkins has his dander up.    Dawkins maintains his own superiority as a scientist over theologians.  His beliefs are based on evidence, while the theologian's are based solely on an alleged revelation of truth in scripture.   That sense of superiority is heightened by his belief that only scientists are open to new evidence that may change their views.  Hmmm...  Not sure about this.   Dawkins states that he believes in evolution because he has studied the evidence.  Oh, really.  I would like to see his beak collection.  He invokes the analogy of evidence as presented in a court of law.  The first problem here is that just as the courtroom relies heavily on eyewitness testimony, so does the New Testament.  In fact, that is what the Gospels are purported to be:  the recounting of eyewitness testimony.  Just as in a court of law, testimony that can be corroborated by multiple witnesses is considered to be more credible:  i.e. four Gospel accounts, not just one.  Part of the mystery and source of authority for the office of the Pope are the degrees of separation leading directly from St. Peter the current Pope:  you can count backwards from this Pope to that Pope to the Pope and on and until that Pope who knew St. Peter, who knew Jesus of Nazareth.   This is what bearing witness is all about.   He also fails to account for the fact that faith evolves - and doctrine changes - in response to the continuing study and interpretation of \\"the evidence\\" which is scripture.  Say goodbye to Limbo.    He consistently employs the same technique of evasive argument to deflect criticism and defend a tenuous position that is favored by conservative politicians and pundits in Washington today.  He takes a legitimate question, \\"How can you know the world would be a better place if only wedidn't have religion?  What about Hitler and Stalin?\\" and rather than answering the question, he attacks the question by reframing and demeaning it.  He first places it in the mouth of a non-credible source, in this case a \\"fictitious apologist\\", he then ridicules the question by attaching assertions that obviously have to be rejected out of hand (any statement invoking Hitler and Stalin requires an absolute imperative), and finally subverts the question by implying a meaning that is often the polar opposite of the question's intent.  In this case, he infers that the question being asked is actually, \\"Don't Hitler and Stalin prove that atheism is evil?\\"  This of course is not the question at all and is a question that no well informed, reasonable person would ask.  But it is the only question he prepared to answer.  This is bush league and grows quickly tiresome.  It suggests that what we are dealing with is more political agenda that scholarly inquiry.    He is always flogging his own Meme Theory.   This is tiresome too    It is indeed high time to challenge the established order in religion.  Mainline religion is failing to keep up.  Dawkins is right to passionately reject creationist attempts to invade the [if I dare, magisterium] of science.   But it is perhaps a delusion to think that 1), religion is the problem and not perhaps a symptom, or that 2), mankind can or even should universally live without some form of religion.  Dawkins admirably references Freud's assertion that it will be hard to do without religion as long as mankind harbors a fear of death; which I think we can all agree is a good fear to have in order to insure the survival of the species.      He is at his best when he is gleefully traducing the Old Testament by recounting the many instances of misbehavior and slaughter but does not seem able to draw any thesis beyond obvious paradox and this only lasts for one chapter.    Dawkins' relentlessness will surely appeal to some.  His outsized egowill not get in the way for others.  He is an aggressive self-promoter and like Michael Moore, will have a devoted following.  If only his book were as entertaining as the movies.  Personally I wish he would stick to chasing Memes.  Dawkins reminds me of a trained physician who is more interested in managing his commercial interests than practicing medicine.        Ultimately, the book must be read -- it is now part of the literature of dissent -- if only so that it can be properly criticized.  It would be immoral; innately, absolutely or dogmatically immoral, whichever you like, to diss the book without reading it.    If you're looking for a good fight, you have found one in this book.  However of Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, the last is the best.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Being a huge fan of Mariah Carey's music, this may read like a biased review of her \\"comeback\\" album. Regardless, it is my opinion that the Emancipation of Mimi is one her best ever in the sense that it is an eclectic mix of different styles targeting a wider variety of audience.     Mariah never \\"left\\" as many have alleged; her voice has always been there. It is just that the delivery was not packaged so well in her most recent outing. This album, however does a great job of showcasing her incredible talents.    From the opening tune of \\"It's Like That\\" through the mega-hit ballad \\"We belong together\\" and the catchy \\"Shake it off\\", this album takes the listener along a fantastic ride of musical joy. My other favorites on this album include \\"Stay the Night\\" and \\"Circles\\". The gospel-themed \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and the sweet, sentimental \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (added in the re-release version) are some of the other prominent selections.    With \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", Mariah continues to show exactly how music can and should be made.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Although it is not soley based off the real battle, it is still a decently depicted movie, despite it being twisted. But the point is to entertain, and yet even as Frank Miller twists it as he does, he still does an amazing job depicting it already. If you don't like, then don't complain, its your opinion, you should have watched the preview. Its an amazing movie, and still depicts the truth. Those 300 men stood up to the tyranny and showed the world they were the fiercest and bravest warriors defending democracy in the west.
1594489505|5.0|I recently finished reading this book and immediately went out to find \\"The Kite Runner\\" which our local library did not have! I did not think I would enjoy the book as much as I did. I knew that living in Afghanistan must have been difficult during their many years of different rules, however, I did not fully appreciate what women went through. This book really opened my eyes and I have recommended it to friends.
0385337388|1.0|I first picked up this book in 1982; I read it for a second time this week. There is little character development as the book evolves through this one resident's personal experience. Aside from the drum beat style the author uses to describe residency training, the reader gets a sense of cynicism toward medical education, the health care system, and the human condition. All of which are sadly real. I feel badly for residents.  They are abused. It's true the endless stream of patients with their various needs & agendas can wear literally one out, but within the text, I looked for a sense of purpose in the main character's decision to become a doctor in the first place; I never found it. The main character would have been more interesting given a sense of direction after residency. With all due respect, I found the book superficial; I will likely not read it again. Thank you.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|If you enjoy charming, semi-biographical period piece films based on literary personalities (i.e.: `Finding Neverland') you will certainly enjoy the turn of the century charm of the '06 release `Miss Potter'. This enchanting family film tells the story of Beatrix Potter and her struggle to express herself and her artistic talents to the male dominated culture of the times. While many may know her as the author of the famous children's book `Tale of Peter Rabbit' and others, few are familiar with her trail blazing life and warrior spirit, as she not only broke the preconceived mold of womanhood prevalent in her day but played an instrumental part in protecting and preserving vast areas of the rural landscape that England is famous for.<br /><br />Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor make a wonderful team as business associates and would be lovers, Beatrix Potter and Norman Wayne. I also enjoyed Emily Watson in the role of Norman's sister Millie, but the real star of the film for me was Lucy Boynton who played the part of young Beatrix. She's absolutely delightful.<br /><br />Miss Potter' will definitely surprise you; solid storyline, charming characters, some unexpected special effects here and there and lots of absolutely magnificent cinematography of the British countryside.
B000003T9B|4.0|As I read some of the other reviews for this album I was struck by how many referred to it as a \\"thrash\\" album.  To me, Overkill was one of those bands - like Forbidden & Holy Terror - that bridged the gap between power metal & thrash metal. They walked a fine line between the two genres.  Maybe they were considered to be a thrash band because some of their early lyrics dealt with satanic themes. In 1986, Overkill was the opening act on the first leg of Slayer's REIGN IN BLOOD tour.  Slayer weren't particularly happy about that because as far as they were concerned, Overkill played a different style of metal.  Still, many thrash fans enjoyed listening to Overkill because they had plenty of attitude.  And with 1985's FEEL THE FIRE, that attitude was prominently on display.    Simply put, Overkill's debut album is the best thing they've ever done.  Pretty much every song is good here, but the best ones are \\"Raise The Dead,\\" \\"Rotten To The Core,\\" \\"Hammerhead,\\" \\"Overkill\\" & the album's title track.  Singer Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth has a sick voice.  He has one of the best screams you'll ever hear.  Guitarist Bobby Gustafson came up with some great riffs.  His solos on \\"Hammerhead\\" & \\"Feel The Fire\\" are amazing.  Bassist D.D. Verni can be heard clearly in the mix.  His playing is just as prominent as Gustafson's.  Rat Skates is a very good drummer.  Check out his intro to \\"Hammerhead.\\" The overall sound of the album is pretty raw, but the band is super-tight.  My copy of FEEL THE FIRE does not contain \\"Sonic Reducer,\\" which is an old Dead Boys song Overkill covered for a Megaforce Records compilation that came out about 20 years ago.  It's a pretty good tune.    Sadly, they've never really been able to follow this album up.  From what I understand Overkill have put out more than ten albums - & are still together today - & they've never been able to recapture the magic of FEEL THE FIRE.  I stopped buying their releases after 1989's THE YEARS OF DECAY.    FEEL THE FIRE would make an excellent addition to anyone's metal collection.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|A great performance captured from the Ronnie James Dio era of Rainbow, and a must have for any avid Rainbow fan.  Great picture and sound quality DVD.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I am a comic book movie fan and thought they did a fantastic job depicting Batman and his darker complexities with this film.  Christian Bale was an excellent choice.  A far cry from Michael Keaton.

0385340540|2.0|It's been so long since I've read a good Grisham book, I was hoping this would be a return to the style and pace of his initial blockbusters.  Not so.  Most of the book has the main character lounging around Bologna with the reader just waiting for something to happen.  Finally, the book picks up the pace in the last 30 or so pages.  The story also has lots of rather large logical flaws, but it's main fault is simply that it's boring.
0316067598|5.0|LONE SURVIVOR is one of the most gripping narratives I've ever read about real life combat and the sacrifices our warrior elite make. Sent to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader surrounded by heavily armed Taliban fighters in the mountains of Afghanistan, the four-man SEAL team, now very close to their target, is discovered by two men and a boy herding goats. What to do? Kill them, or let them go? Under the Rules of Engagement, killing unarmed civilians would almost certainly result in their being brought up on murder charges, but letting the goatherds go to sound the alarm would be an equally certain death sentence.     The question the book raises is, how much leeway do you give men who are out there \\"on the wall\\" (in this case on the mountain) doing the brave, but sometimes dirty work necessary to keep us safe? In my view, you give them all they need or you stay out of such conflicts. To quote Marcus, \\"Any government that thinks war is somehow fair and subject to rules like a baseball game probably should not get into one. Because nothing's fair in war, and occasionally the wrong people do get killed.\\"     This is a book that will keep you turning pages far into the night. Highly recommended!

0553588486|5.0|This ranks as one of the best fantasy books ever written for adults. Flawed heroes, sympathetic villains, greed and lust, pride and cowardice, this epic has it all.<br /><br />Unlike other books by lesser talents, Martin delivers period detail, world building and character development without ever forgetting to be a great storyteller. This plot really moves!!!<br /><br />I finished this massive novel in two days, my eyes totally destroyed, and then I rushed off to get his next book and abuse myself some more.<br /><br />The sweet joy of pain!
1400064287|5.0|JFK inspired a nation to go to the moon. As the authors say: \\"Here's the thing: You're not JFK.\\" This book, however, shows you how you can inspire people to listen and take action anyway--as \\"not-JFK.\\" As you. Before page 50, I was telling all my friends about the book. By the time I hit page 150, I was telling anyone I knew even faintly. (I may have told a few strangers.) We all yearn to be heard, and most of us are in touch with wanting to make a contribution. This book is an Essential Toolkit to make our contributions stick.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|If I were to make a list of the top 10 must-see movies of the decade so far, this would be one of them. There is much to learn in this tightly-woven, well-written, and powerfully-acted historical drama that says in simplest form, \\"In order to continue to be free, we must stand against the odds and continue to fight for that freedom.\\"<br /><br />In choosing Gerard Butler for this lead role, the producers added much to the statement. A more \\"in-crowd\\" actor would have diminished the idea of going against the odds and staying true to who you are in spite of opposing opinions and the social hype of \\"should be.\\" Butler epitomizes the stance of standing outside the crowd and succeeding there, and anyone who has seen his interviews knows the role is both \\"him\\" and enough unlike him to be an honest acting role. They didn't fit the part to the actor (such as Affleck and company playing themselves in different roles). They picked an actor with the talent to both fit the part and to make it his own.<br /><br />Along with the skill of the actors involved, the artistry of the movie is something rarely seen in mainstream cinema today. It was exceptionally filmed, dramatic and scenic and vivid without an excess of gore, and with enough humor to bring occasional relief from the drama.<br /><br />There are many lessons in this film. Let's hope they will be captured and taken away after the credits roll.
076531178X|5.0|Other reviewers have covered the many pro's and limited con's of this book quite well enough.  I would add that this book scores points simply because I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!  I came to care about the characters and I was quickly vested in their welfare.  The end of the book was complete and satisfying enough that I can wait until the sequel comes out with longing rather than frustration.  I can't wait to read more!  Elantris was wonderful, Mistborn was amazing-- who knows what wonders Sanderson may continue to create as he perfects his art?<br /><br />P.S. I met Sanderson at a literary conference and when he spoke about writing, he was truly inspiring.  He loves what he does!
B000OONQBM|4.0|Bret Fetzer hits the nail in his review: the comic book transitions added by Walter Hill seems to overkill the movie. That's the only reason I rated it whith four stars instead of five.  The warriors is not a masterpice, but triumphs over its limitations. The premise is timeless: a group of (literally) warriors is unjustly acused of a murder and forced to fight its way back home against overwhelming forces. Some details of the film are cheesy, but it has style, and the over-the-top costumes and makeup plays ultimately in its favor, not bounding it to any particular period.  This HD DVD edition is very good. The transfer is flowless, with excelente constrast and wonderful colors. There are four interesting featurettes on the movie. What impresed me most was the interviews with cinematographer Andrew Laszlo. He details all the problems they faced shooting by night in locations, and one just wonders at his skill and artistic sense (the problem of the unpredictably summer rain in New York turns an ally at the end, because it was the perfect excuse to spread water over the pavement and thus reflect street ligths and make even richer the colors on the frame).   I fully recommend this movie in HD DVD (though I not find the director's cut 100% satisfactory, but maybe it's just a matter of personal preference).
B000002MIY|3.0|Own just about everything this guy has ever done, both alone and in Steely Dan. This one didn't do it for me, when most everything else does. Can't put my finger on issues, just doesn't have the pizzaz that most others do. Arrangements are not as appealing with fewer fun ditties that stick in my head. Liked it fine, just expected to love it. Hard to live up to expectations when you set the bar so high, Mr. Fagen. Hey, LOVED Morph the Cat!!!
B000RJO58M|3.0|After loving Shaun of the Dead so much, I had high hopes for Hot Fuzz, and was let down. It wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be, and kind of lost direction at times. Alright, but not a must.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|After seeing the movie, this became my second soundtrack album in my collection of music (Grace of my Heart was first). I love it, but the music is much more powerful when combined with the visuality of the movie. Some very meaningful lyrics go with some nice driving music. Overall very well done. Happy to own.
1594489505|5.0|It seems those who reviewed the book here had a lot to say, which is a good indication of a good book, but I will be purposefully brief.  There are few books that I have read in the past year that haunted me during the reading and now after as much.  The characters are very well drawn and the plotting is paced with precision that keeps the pages turning.  As an American who struggles with the conflict we are currently in with the middle east this book and The Kite Runner allow a good look into the human struggle that is taking place over there.  This book is not only good fiction (though sadly much of the tragedy is drawn from the real human struggle there) but it provides another level of compassion that clearly indicates how we human beings all want the same thing and that the human beings caught in the madness of the Taliban et al, are NOT our enemy.  Bravo Mr. Hosseini, I will be look for your third with anticipation.  Thank you for a wonderful story.
B000002KXV|5.0|Love almost everything this guy does, whether alone or in Steely Dan. Ths one was no exception. Lost my old copy... got upset.... bought another on Amazon. So glad I did. Listen to it all the time.
0800177177|4.0|This early 1990's version of the classic Bram Stoker story has a lot going for it. The director is Francis Ford Coppola who made The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Combine this with a cast including Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves and you'd have thought this was a recipe for a masterpiece - sadly not I'm afraid.<br /><br />Although visually its very impressive, especially in the excellent first half hour, in general the whole thing is hugely overblown and in a lot of cases over-acted. I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, but in the key role of Van Helsing he just overplayed his part too much. A little less ham please Sir Anthony. However, its unfair only to level criticism at one actor. In general this applies to the whole cast. Gary Oldman although not as bad as Hopkins has the same problem. Perhaps we should blame Coppola.<br /><br />Lets be positive though. The music score by Wojciech Kilar is excellent and I bought the soundtrack recording of this when it first came out. In many ways his score is reminisant of James Bernards great scores for the Hammer Dracula films. Furthermore in comparison to the truly awful 'Van Helsing' (2004) this IS a masterpiece. So this is a good film, with some flaws yes, but very entertaining nevertheless, and I have bought it.
0783225547|4.0|Was very pleased with the campy, family oriented feeling I got from this film.  A small, pleasant town is suddenly rocked with the huge challenge of accepting the possibility that the nearby inactive Volcano could soon decimate the peaceful world around them.  Brosnan is great but the actress who plays alongside him is even better.  Linda Hamilton has always impressed me in the roles that she plays in and her role in this one is just as good.<br /><br />A single mother of 2 and a leader in the community, Hamilton soon teams up with Brosnan as they begin to run across signs that show the area is in trouble.  A small but sweet romantic spark seems to start between the two, but there is no time for love when the trouble begins.<br /><br />Earth shaking scenes of carnage and lava flows devouring everything in their path suddenly put everyone in peril, and the scenes of escape and also of being trapped do add some suspenseful feelings as the second half of this film really rocks with scene after scene of the action, and the impending after effect of the lava.  There are a lot of natural disaster style movies that came out during this time, but I happen to feel that Dante's peak was one of the better ones.
B000R8YC18|5.0|This searing movie from Martin Scorcese is one of the great films of the 1970's. It features Robert DeNiro in the role of a lifetime, as ex-Vietnam vet Travis Bickle, who can't sleep and drives a Cab at night as a form of therapy. Travis also has trouble relating to people and it is this that gives him difficulties when he meets Betsy (played wonderfully by Cybill Shepherd) and things go from bad to worse when he then meets Iris (Jodie Foster) a teenage prostitute.... The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Scorsese works magic in this film. A number of scenes from this film are unforgettable and some have become iconic. Obviously the \\"Are you talking to me...\\" mirror scene is the most well known but there are a number of others. Travis winds up a Secret Service agent, suggesting he would like to join. This is marvellously played, and you will notice that Travis has made some slight adjustments to his hair. Another classic scene, which certainly influenced Quentin Tarantino for a scene in 'Reservoir Dogs', is where Travis goes to buy some guns. The dialog is marvellous. Full credit to Paul Schrader for the brilliant script, without his contribution the film would not have as good.<br /><br />The film also contains the last ever film score from Bernard Hermann who had previously done Citizen Kane and Psycho to name but two. This score is really excellent. A Jazzy saxophone with a haunting melody, but that changes menacingly without warning. Quite brilliant.<br /><br />This is, particularly at the end, a very violent film and one with an ending that may leave you perplexed. However it is an essential DVD for any serious film collection.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite moview for the human interest, the delicate handling of a difficult reality for many people...the humor and the performances.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Helllllooooo, for those of you who are interested in a historical drama that never happened and isn't true (Gladiator)this movie is not for you.....Ever heard of Frank Miller? his name is just all over this movie, for those of you who haven't Frank Miller is the creator of Graphic Novels (Does Sin City ring any bells?) and the movies based on his Graphic Novels are indeed actually based on his Graphic Novels not something that is trying to imitate real life. yes he based his novel on a historical event, but other than that it's his own brain child (hence 9' tall enemys that could throw a buick without blinking) so for those of you who do not understand the genre i only have one thing to say, try watching a preview once in a while, that's what there for. don't just go out and rent/buy a movie you know nothing about and then cry becouse it's not what you wanted it to be.
B000OT6V00|5.0|I like this movie although I would not say I love it based on the story. I picked it up thinking the picture would be awesome on blue ray. I was not wrong. As another review stated, the blue flames were brilliant. I really noticed the detail on Hellboys face. Sound was great. I noticed alot of sound I did not hear before. It is (or was when I bought it) one of the cheaper films on BRay and it was well worth it.

B00005JPLW|5.0|300 is a rare movie that succeeds as pure entertainment, as fairly accurate historical fiction, and as a movie with important messages for our times.  I'll take these in turn.<br /><br />Much of the critique of the movies' lack of accuracy borders on pedantic.  No, the Spartans didn't fight in the near-nude, but then again, the idealized male form has been used to depict this battle on media as diverse as classical pottery and oil on canvas.  It has a long and noble tradition.  No, Xerxes probably wasn't an 8 foot tall, bald man of a sexually ambiguous nature, but since he is meant to embody an overwhelming threat to the West, some hyperbole is not out of line.  Criticisms like this miss the larger point:  this is not meant to be Saving Private Ryan, much less a Ken Burns documentary.  It is a film depiction of a comic book that was in turn based on the battle of Thermopylae.<br /><br />That said, the movie still hews close to its historical roots.  The best lines come, not from Frank Miller, but from the contemporaneous history written by Herodotus in the 5th century B.C.  (when told that the arrows of the Persians will blot out the sun, the Spartans are said to have responded \\"Then we will fight in the shade\\").  Look, don't take my word for it.  Eminent classicist Victor Davis Hanson writes:<br /><br />\\"Again, purists must remember that 300 seeks to bring a comic book, not Herodotus, to the screen. Yet, despite the need to adhere to the conventions of Frank Miller's graphics and plot -- every bit as formalized as the protocols of classical Athenian drama or Japanese Kabuki theater -- the main story from our ancient Greek historians is still there: Leonidas, against domestic opposition, insists on sending an immediate advance party northward on a suicide mission to rouse the Greeks and allow them time to unite a defense. Once at Thermopylae, he adopts the defenses to the narrow pass between high cliffs and the sea far below. The Greeks fight both en masse in the phalanx and at times range beyond as solo warriors. They are finally betrayed by Ephialtes, forcing Leonidas to dismiss his allies -- and leaving his own 300 to the fate of dying under a sea of arrows.\\"<br /><br />If it's good enough for VDH, it's good enough for you.<br /><br />Finally, the movie entertains, even moves, but in so doing teaches us about ourselves and our future.  The movie is exciting as all get out.  It is hyper-violent.  And yes, the sub-plots occasionally drag.  However, the idea of an impassioned few standing up to tyranny has such resonance that the battle scenes stir like none other.  It's the blood-spattered, manly art of war set to an industrial rock soundtrack, but it's also a paean to self-sacrifice and freedom.  Like those who have answered the call of freedom at Valley Forge, Omaha Beach, and now Basra, these men fight not just for glory.  They would prefer to die fighting for freedom than live on their knees.  History has not ended.  If the West is to remain free, the we will do well to keep alive a memory of men like Leonidas, the 300 Spartans and the other Greeks who gave their lives the narrow pass of Thermopylae.<br /><br />5 starsnge beyond as solo warriors.

B00005JPFE|5.0|Everyone knew that Paris hotels had the biggest, friendliest and juiciest fleas in the world with whom all tourists fell in love at the first bite. A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference. I must admit though the few views of the Eiffel Tower were quite appetizing.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnethough some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice.

0385720920|4.0|I read this book a few years and I remember not being able to put it down after I started.  I honestly can't stay focus long enough to finish a book and this is the 2nd Chuck Palahnuick book that I was actually able to finish.  The other being Fight Club.  If you liked Fight Club, then you will love this book.  It's written in the same signature to the point of action style that the writer is known for.  It's not a perfect book because there are points of confusion, but then again this is Chuck we're talking about.  Fight Club still my favorite from the writer, but my experience is limited to this book, Fight Club and Survivor.  Just read this one and you'll thank me later.  By the way, there are quite descriptive scenes of bio fluid movement that might make your stomach turn.  So if you get sick easily from readin about them, then this is a fair warning.  Just don't let that stop you from reading this book.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I got to say I was completely stubborn in reading \\"Eragon\\" for several years now.  And I finally sat down and read this book.  I enjoyed it and think that Paolini has potentially in the future with his career.  Anyway, I just recently finished \\"Eragon\\" and wanted to see the movie.  Taking out from the my local library (which was a good choice on my part). Two and a half hours later, you had a disappointed person sitting on the couch.    Where was the bond between Brom and Eragon?  What the heck Arya is an elf, you know.  Eragon was suppose to be able to fight with both hands (left and right due to an injury).  And Saphira kinda just grow up in a matter of what? 3 seconds.  I felt that the relationship was pitiful with both Saphira and Brom (yeah, I basically shrugged when he died in the movie.)  I thought Saphira's version was blue not red.  Something they should have changed if they plan to make a sequel (which I hope they don't. I have not finished the second book yet)  I felt like this movie was more like \\"Lord of the Rings in training\\" with all that random running.  Like \\"The Return of the King\\" it did not come through for the fans (at least in my opinion).  Paolini should have written or helped in the screenplay.  Maybe it would have been better, maybe.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|Inland Empire is one of Lynch's most unique pictures, a really strange, vivid, haunting, yet flawed movie.  Its main flaw is its mammoth running time (3 hours), and that Lynch has abandoned (at least for now) 35mm film in favor of digital video.  David likes the DV a lot more, but it also detracts from the film itself, as it's often muddy (especially when projected) and, at times, amateurish.  While Lynch was making this film, he took his time over a period of 2 years, making it was exactly as he wanted it.  I feel that sometimes that allows a filmmaker to be too indulgent, and this film often feels like that.  But there are so many instances of filmic brilliance that the film is still worth watching.<br /><br />Kudos to the actors who not only reside in Lynch's world, but who give great performances.  Laura Dern is phenomenal as the woman, Jeremy Irons is very good, and Justin Theroux gives another brooding performane in a Lynch film (he was fabulous in Mulholland Drive).  Theroux has a really brooding intensity and nervous energy, like he's about to flip out at any time.  While I feel the film would have been better if he had shot it in 35mm, it's still good.  Lynch could film with an ancient, hand crank camera from the silent days and still make something interesting.  This film is really something to see, despite its flaws.  It makes you think for days afterwards.  Lynch is a great filmmaker, one of the greatest working in cinema today.  A work like this demands respect, and should be treated with such.  That doesn't mean you have to love it, but you should at least acknowledge its ambition and respect it for that.<br /><br />The special features are range from quite good to a waste of time.  There is some great behind the scenes footage (a huge cut above the usual, Hollywood featurette) where we see Lynch happy, exhilarated, and very angry.  Kudos to Lynch for showing his dark (bad pun, I know) side.  A man named Jeremy (his co-producer) gets it the worst from Lynch.  Lynch even helps build sets (which is mentioned in the credits).  There are 2 short films on the supplemental disc, one called Ballerina (which, honestly, is really, really boring), and Quinoa, where we see David Lynch cooking, what else, Quinoa.  It's interesting mainly because it's David Lynch doing the cooking, but it's nothing really earth shattering.  There are 75 minutes of deleted scenes, some interesting, some really boring.  It may have been interesting to edit them together into a 75 minute film, but Lynch didn't do that.  The deleted scenes (or as he calls it \\"more things that happened\\") happen back to back without any attempt at cohesion.<br /><br />Overall, Inland Empire is a very good film, recommended mainly to Lynch fans.Lynch.

B00005JKMQ|2.0|Rather disappointing film about the life and times of the famous boxer.  The name Cassius Clay (his real name) is never brought about.  Also a downer was that it seemed to center more on Malcom X later in the movie than Clay himself.  It was funny seeing a young Don King represented but instead of getting to know the man, the viewer is bandied about with constant themes of racism, the draft and other pieces of the 1960s.  I know that is a part of his life but personally I really did not enjoy it, instead of feeling like I was viewing his life, I was viewing the life around him.  Will Smith is cast as Ali but honestly, they portray the man as if he could only talk when ranting about how great he was with \\"float like a butterfly/sting like a bee\\" and \\"I am the greatest\\" being punched at me over and over again.  I must say again, this film is more about the life and times that happened around Ali than about his personal life or boxing legacy.
0613174674|3.0|This was an interesting book, although there were parts of it, dealing with the trial, that went on and on to the point where I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the book - but I am glad I perservered.  This is more or less a \\"coming-of-age\\" book in which 15 year old Michael Berg, finds himself in love with a woman twice his age.  Although I have to admit, since I have a child that age, I had a hard time with the age difference at first, but it got to the point where I was so wrapped up with the characters the eventually I forgot all about the age difference.  This is a book about your first love, and how those memories linger through your life time. The book was very touching and as you read about the couple, how their relationship suddenly and mysteriously ended, and how eventually they rediscover again.  It is about the realization that sometimes you fall in love with someone that you know absolutely nothing about...and that people aren't always who they appear to be.  Be sure to have a box of tissues close by.<br />I wanted to give this 3 1/2 stars...........
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Many people I think watch this movie and expect it to be just a no brainer of a slasher flick.  The true meaning I got out of this film was that it was actually a very good script that surrounded the ideals of International travel and hopeless circumstances.  This is a film that takes its time and does not just douse the viewer with blood and severed body parts for two hours.  There is a great twist in it towards the end...two actually, that really help sell the mystique.  There are a lot of different things going on but they are all told in a manner in which they fit nicely into the plot, and all the loose ends come together for a finality that is a justice of sorts which happens in the bathroom of a train station.  You will follow a survivor of peril as he goes from country traveler to hero and eventually you will find him at the end, on the path of redemption.  I have never been a big fan of Tarantino movies and this one does have some of his style, but in fact I think this script is excellent and I would like to see Tarantino try another hand at this type of film perhaps in the future.  Despite a vague DVD cover, do not think that this film is a couple of hours of people being chopped up for dinner in a dank cell, there is so much here than meets the eye...no pun intended!  The film is about a group of young males who are traveling around other places of the world, backpacking college student types.  They soon are led with some advice, to a Slovakian city that is very isolated but full of beautiful young women and pesky elementary school age children in a gang.  Soon bad things start happening and one of the backpackers realizes that his vacation of fun has turned into a nightmare.  Beyond the walls something is going on that is far more sinister than anything that could be imagined, and with a capitalist structure within that very horror, the lone backpacker soon finds himself fighting for more than just his life.  Directing is a cut above the norm and I give it five stars without hesitation.<br /><br />Zane Joryt five stars without hesitation.    Zane Jory
B000GFLKF8|2.0|This movie had great potential.  I'm not a big fan of Spike Lee.  I think his movies sort of drag out and impose his political viewpoints other than just entertaining the audience.  This movie is no different.  In fact, I got to a certain point of the movie and turned it off.  Reason being, it was boring to say the least.<br /><br />It dragged, it dealt with stereo types and racial profiles, it just didn't entertain.  I felt Spike Lee's message was becoming just like all his other movies.  I admit, when I saw Spike Lee's name on the movie, I knew right there it would be much of the same.  But, in all do fairness, I decided to give it a chance.  I should've went with my first instinct.<br /><br />The cast was fantastic, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, these are \\"heavy-hitters\\" in the movies.  Too bad the story didn't bring out their talents.<br /><br />I would say to pass on this one.  Only because it took too long to really tell the story.  It needs to be edited to make it move a little more.  Unless the Director believes that \\"editing\\" will stifle his creative vision.  But, sometimes vision needs glasses in order to \\"focus\\" better.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|First, I am a devoted fan of the band so I may not be as much impartial as I would want to. Still, I think that it is a very good album. Like I read from other review, it is what \\"Train of Thought\\" should have been. It is different from other Dream theater albums and definitevely more heavier, but it keeps that prog vibe on the deep. Particularly, I prefer the more prog-melodic style of \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" and I hope the next album to be a \\"Metropolis part III\\", but I still think that \\"Systematic Chaos\\" is a very well developed album.
B000PA9Q6E|4.0|A raucous and pleasing concert  for blues fans  from 1977. Some of the singing gets a little crazy but overall a solid performance. Blues is not a large share of the commercial market and its up to  diehard fans to keep supporting it.
B000QUCNP4|1.0|This flick is just gosh awful!  I had such high hopes for it, given the  cast, but the film is totally sabotaged by poor direction.  R. Downey Jr. mumbles nearly all of his lines with a cigarette in his mouth, so don't count on understanding him. Other characters rival his  mumbling as well.  The film is too long, should have been edited down to  2 hrs max.  Too many subtitles are so miniscule as to be illegible most of the time. And the lighting? Just awful. Too bad this work which had potential is such a failure!
B000PTYPAC|3.0|This cd is not a bad one but it sounds like they haven't broke free from their first album. The sound is a little bit more varied this time around which is good but the lyrics aren't so much. The songs sound like just another version of their other songs off \\"All We Know Is Falling\\". For example, If you listen to \\"Born For This\\" you can obviously spot the strong resemblance to \\"Pressure\\". After I listened to \\"Misery Business\\", I thought this album would be a lot different for the better. I was expecting way different sound from \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" and lyrics but it just didn't deliver.

It's very validating for those of us who have been mislabeled because we are HSPs, or for those of us who have misunderstood and mislabeled ourselves. What a relief!    I also recommend reading \\"Too Loud, Too Bright, Too Fast, Too Tight: What to Do If You Are Sensory Defensive in an Overstimulating World\\" by Sharon Heller. Elaine Aron's books helped get me on the right track, but until I read Heller's book, there was not real relief.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Being a true crime buff, I eagerly anticipated two recent releases:  Brian DePalma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\" and David Fincher's \\"Zodiac.\\"  The Black Dahlia film was incredibly inept in every respect, simply an awful movie.  As such, I went to see \\"Zodiac\\" in an extremely skeptical state of mind.  I was not disappointed this time.  \\"Zodiac\\" is one of the most gripping crime dramas ever made, comparable to such classics as \\"In Cold Blood,\\" \\"The Boston Strangler,\\" \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"Capote.\\"<br />Being a Bay Area native (as is director Fincher), I remember very clearly the palpable sense of fear and anxiety which enveloped the San Francisco area during the Zodiac's reign of terror in the late '60's - early '70's.  The media went wild, curfews were imposed, doors were locked and bolted, guns were purchased, and children were herded inside well before dark.  Scary times.<br />And all that has been vividly brought back in this starkly realistic, understated yet extraordinarily powerful film.  David Fincher has captured the very essence of time and place, taking us back to a much more innocent era darkened by such California horrors as the Zodiac crimes in San Francisco and the Manson / Tate murders in Los Angeles (both occuring during the same summer of 1969).  Scary times indeed.<br /><br />This story is much more a crime procedural than a \\"serial killer\\" film, as the murders themselves are de-emphasized over the incredible efforts (and some real blunders) made by the S.F.P.D. and other local law enforecment agencies to identify and capture this monster.  The killings are presented, however, in an incredibly realistic (and EXTREMELY accurate) manner, and as such are truly horrifying and difficult to watch.<br /><br />To those who feel the film is too long, or boring, or not violent enough, all I can offer is the fact that this was all real, not made up by some hack screenwriter.  Perhaps because I lived through those times and have extremely vivid memories of them, this film carries more import for me personally.  I can say that I held my breath for most of the film's running time and did not experience a nano-second of boredom (in fact I actually felt the film could have covered MORE ground--i.e., the early killings not depicted in the film).<br /><br />As in real life, the end result is far from satisfying:  the killer was never caught, and the film leaves you hanging, just as we all were left hanging over 30 years ago.  Frustrating, yes...but that's the way it was.<br />Simply put, this film is superb in every way:  direction, screenplay, photography, production design, music, acting (though I must briefly note that I've had about enough of Robert Downey's  twitchy, mumbling performances, and if there were any one thing I'd change about this film it would be his casting).<br /><br />An intense, cerebral, unsettling and ultimately shocking film.  Highly, highly recommended.  Five stars.ort for me personally.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is probably one of the BEST concert DVDs I have had the pleasure of watching.     I have been an Eagles fan for a long time and, unfortunately, have NEVER seen them live. This DVD, filmed in Melbourne, Australia, is the next best thing to being there.    The sound and picture quality are both excellent. Each member of the band, including the horn section and backup players, had their moment to shine.    Now for the Eagles themselves. Those guys have only gotten BETTER with age. Their harmonies are just about the most perfect I have ever heard. Each one of them gets to sing lead and do some of their solo works (Henley's \\"Boys of Summer\\" is fantastic). Joe Walsh, the court jester of rock and roll, seems to be having the time of his life and brings a refreshing amount of comic relief to the band without overdoing it. It's obvious that these guys have long since gotten over their differences and now enjoy a level of chemistry that is far beyond what they had ever had in the past.    The concert is full-length and sports some pretty good extras featuring back stage moments and interviews with the band.    Of particular note is the NEW Frey-penned song \\"No More Cloudy Days\\". What a great song! Hopefully, it will be on the next Eagles album (when the heck is it being released already?????).    Eagles fans will not be disappointed.    WELL worth the money!
1594489505|3.0|I was bored.  This novel was not bad, but it wasn't good.  The author had quite a success with Kite Runner, another novel I didn't get.  I believe that his success is due to America's curiosity about Afghanistan.  In fact, this book appeared to be written almost to serve as a novelization of Afghanistan's recent history.  Of course, anyone with even a passing knowledge about recent history will not be especially enlightened by this book, and the writing and characterization alone are not good enough to merit reading.  If you are not going to live forever, I would skip this book.  I mean, it's not horrible, but we're all going to die someday and don't you want to spend your time reading the best books you can?
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|Wow! After 14 years, who would have thought the Eagles would ever get back together?    This landmark event has been presented on a DVD with excellent sound and picture quality and includes interviews and clips of backstage antics. After a \\"fourteen year vacation\\", the Eagles prove that they still have what it takes to bring the house down. Their harmonies are still AMAZING and their guitar playing is just about some of the best around.    The only reason I give this 4 stars is because it is mostly a mellow performance from the band. With the exception of \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Life In the Fast Lane\\", the rest of the songs are ballads. Don't get me wong, the Eagles write amazing ballads, it's just that playing almost all of them back to back keeps the overall pace of the show pretty slow. Also, with just a couple of exceptions, most of the songs on this DVD are acoustic versions of some of their greatest hits. Again, I love hearing different arrangements and versions of classic songs, but it keeps the pace of the concert generally slow.    Any Eagles fan (like me) will absolutely LOVE this DVD. I still watch it  at least 3 or 4 times a year.

B00000272N|5.0|Layne Staley will forever remain my favorite vocalist of all time, despite his tragic death. Jerry Cantrell is one of the most talented guitarists in heavy music.   When I first heard AIC, it was junior high, and \\"Again\\" was getting airplay on MTV and radio. Of course, I loved that song, so I picked up their entire catalog of music.   Facelift packed the most metallic punch of all their albums, and included the classic hits \\"We Die Young\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" and of course \\"Man In the Box\\". Also, every song on here is simply incredible, and while this is not their best album, it is the most intense and darkest.   If you are new to heavy music, this is one of the pioneering bands of modern hard rock and grunge, and you have probably heard them again and again on rock radio. They receive my highest recommendation.
0385340559|2.0|The first chapter made the book sound promising, but the rest of it fell way short of any substance.  The characters seemed empty as if they were going through the motions.

0606192166|4.0|Those who know Truman Capote's alternately poignant and comic 1958 novella only through the memorable 1961 Audrey Hepburn [[ASIN:B000BTGY1O film]] directed by Blake Edwards may be surprised to find that Holly Golightly, in her original incarnation, is recalled in a flashback as a nineteen-year old Manhattan \\"party girl\\" during WWII. The still provocative story is really a memory piece fifteen years later by the narrator, a struggling writer with no name except the one given to him by Holly - \\"Fred\\" - after her beloved brother. The rest of the elements will be familiar to anyone who has seen the movie, though Capote is more forthright in describing Holly's hedonistic behavior than film censors could allow in the early sixties. Revealed gradually is her background as Lulumae Barnes, a hillbilly child-bride to Doc Golightly, written with more comedy than pathos here, as well as her erratic, amoral journey to Hollywood as a starlet and then as a \\"companion\\" to wealthy men in New York who give her cash for the powder room.<br /><br />Eccentric characters fill in the corners like Mr. Yunioshi, the Japanese fashion photographer who lives upstairs, and Sally Tomato, the gangster who passes messages to Holly while serving time in Sing Sing. Capote has less affinity for the romantic conventions found in the movie as he more comfortably explores the tale of two emotionally stunted people who find momentary support from one another. The melancholy ending is testament to that, and as such, the book is well worth reading for Capote's gift for illustrative prose. Three very brief stories from Capote are also included with the book, all with their charms - \\"The House of Flowers\\", the fanciful tale of two warring bordellos in the West Indies; \\"A Diamond Guitar\\", a tender story of a prison inmate who attempts to use his glass-diamonded guitar as a means to escape; and \\"A Christmas Memory\\", a childhood remembrance of his distant cousin embodied by the elderly Sook.

A Thousand Splendid Suns is quite simply, a beautiful book.  Yes, Mr Hosseini follows the same sort of trajectory as he did in The Kite Runner, but John Irving's novels tend to share similar outlines and locales with each other.  It is called having a \\"voice\\".    If you enjoy John Irving or Charles Dickens, you will enjoy Khaled Hoesseini's novels as well.    A Thousand Splendid Suns is that rare book that moves forward with ease at the same time that it is educating you.  And on top of that, it packs a truly mighty emotional wallop!!    I highly recommend it!
0060899190|4.0|My review title says it all. One of the main things that drew me to PostSecret is that it is that glimpse into other people's lives, minds and thought processes that all human begins LOVE to get. Let's face it, we all like to hear the dirt on someone else - even if it's someone we don't know. This book is just that.<br /><br />Also, everyone who reads this book will tell you that at some point they came upon one (or a few) of the secrets that they could relate to. All of a sudden, you find something funny, touching, scary or disgusting and you say to yourself: \\"wow - that's just like me!\\" Then you feel a little less alone in the world. :-)<br /><br />Finally, many of these secrets have been presented in really uniquely artistic ways. Check it out, the illustrations and designs are as compelling as the secrets themselves.<br /><br />Definitely something that'll stay on my coffee table for a really long time. An excellent gift.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Amazing, I put this guys in the same ranking of Led Zeppelin, U2 and Queen. What is happening with the US bands that can not achieve this quality? (with the exception of The Killers).
B000OZ2CZW|1.0|Oh Dear,    What will she release next year??? A country Album?  Will she be Bad girl gone Good??? She has to strip and change her style(if she has one) to keep the public interested...    She is an image created to be so popular, but her album isnt selling as good as they are making us think, for an artist that has been on the charts for 9/wo week, her album hasn't even gone gold yet, but Maroon 5, Pink with U & ur hand, Justin Timberlake with Summer Love which didn't even go to #1 on Billboard have all gone gold???  I dunno I think it is like One person buying or downloading a song/album a million times so people will think everyone is buying it and then they start to buy it too...    An image created because talent & this girl don't go together...  If not 4 Jay pushing her with those endorsement deals, she wud be forgotten like that Tierra Marie.  But if i was her i wouldn't feel too bad, at least u never took ur clothes off to sell an album, keep flippin those burgers girl ;-)...

B000E1MTXQ|5.0|I bought this DVD initially in standard def and enjoyed it, but after getting the HD-DVD version, there is no comparison. The HD-DVD version has so much more detail and vibrancy, it was like watching it for the first time all over again. I especially like that the movie was filmed in Europe, as I had lived there for close to 3 years back in the 70's. European locations have a certain \\"feel\\" for me that makes me a bit nostalgic, but there is so much character in the architecture, streets, etc, that it makes the film so much more interesting, at least to me.
B00003CXAT|4.0|John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has come up with the most incredible idea for a theme park yet.  He has found a way to clone dinosaurs.  He's thought of all the controls to keep the population in check and the dangerous ones under control.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his investors aren't sure that the park is safe.  So, before he can open it, he has to bring in dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to sign off on the park.<br /><br />The three are admittedly impressed by what they see, especially Alan and Ellie.  But the wonder soon turns to horror when security goes down, freeing the creatures.  Suddenly, the group finds themselves stranded on an island in a storm fighting to survive these creatures from the past.  Will any of them make it off the island alive?<br /><br />This movie was one of the first to use computer effects, and it revolutionized the industry.  Frankly, these effects still hold up even today.  You'll really believe that these people are interacting with the dinosaurs.<br /><br />The biggest weakness is the story.  It starts out very slowly while the science is explained.  There's lots of talking in the first hour.  Once the dinosaurs get loose, the movie kicks into high gear and becomes an edge of your seat thrill ride.  It doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, I still get knots in my stomach during most of these scenes.  Unfortunately, the climax is again weaker then it could have been.<br /><br />I have never understood why this movie was marketed at kids with fast food tie-ins and action figures.  This isn't a kid's film.  It's downright scary for at least half the length.<br /><br />Despite the weaknesses in the story, this is still a well deserved classic.  If you haven't seen it, you're in for a heart pumping thrill ride.
B000OCXF0Q|1.0|I've sampled/downloaded a good majority of the songs on this album.  After having heard all the songs I realized that it was a complete waste of my time.    This crap is worse than even her first album.  I thought Avril's second was a very nice improvement and it showed that she had some talent.  But THIS is just plain horrible.  \\"Girlfriend\\"?  Please.  It's completely unappealing and I believe that the only reason anyone over the age of 11 would like it is because it's got a \\"beat\\" to it.    That beat from \\"Girlfriend\\" is pretty much the same exact thing, more or less, in every other damn song on the record.    I would not recommend this CD to anyone except young girls... like, in the \\"tween\\" age.
1400079179|3.0|Wow, nearly 3500 reviews of this book on Amazon. That says something for its impact. For a book that breathlessly seeks to combine a thriller with a broad rethinking of some of the most sacred Christian beliefs, that is indeed something. Imagine telling someone in 1980 that the hottest book of the future would be about ancient Christian relics, codes, art history, and symbology?<br /><br />Many have already noted the books \\"tell-all, leave-the-reader-to-imagine-nothing\\" style of storytelling, and many dismiss the theories brought up by the book. It's true that the conspiracy-style theorizing is sometimes inconsistent -- for example, the book argues that the Romans adopted Christianity to shore up their empire and that they expunged the goddess-worshipping aspects of early Christianity, even though the Emperor Constantine was a goddess-worshipper himself (huh?).<br /><br />Less often noted is perhaps a key to the book's appeal: the dizzying allure of re-imagining everything you think you know. What if the man known as Jesus Christ did have a family, and hence a bloodline? What if there were relics that cast new light on this old story, that may show that Mary Magdelene was the wife of Jesus, etc. Of course, these stories are so entrenched in the human imagination that no proof, no matter how incontrovertible, could erase them. But it's fascinating to ponder, and perhaps it is a clue to a new kind of Christianity that is emerging, one less reliant on dogma, and more open to interpretation, to each person's experience of the sacred.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book, like the secret societies it features, fall into a curious kind of spiritual materialism in thinking that some object, like an ancient cup, holds the key to anything important. The Holy Grail is clearly a metaphor for the human heart -- the sacred vessel which holds the essence, the blood, the holiest of holies, that which has always been, and will always be: the light of the soul. Searching for this grail leads one within oneself, not to some musty old church basement.self, not to some musty old church basement.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I bought this card because I was in need of more memory for my games.  That's about all I can say about it.  Except that, I bought Sony because they created the Playstation and the price at Amazon is cheaper than at Walmart.
0385751060|5.0|This is a book about understanding and tolerance.  You are taken along the journey of a little boy named Bruno as he travels from Berlin to Out-With (what he calls Auschwitz) because he is the son of a Nazi Commandant.  Through Bruno's experiences, the author shows us how we should look at the world from other people's point of view and try to understanding their history--where they came from and how they became who they are when you interact with them presently.  This is one of the themes throughout the novel that really caught my attention and I believe it is what the story is really about rather than just another novel about the cruelty of the Holocaust.         This book does not have a happy ending.  When it comes to Holocaust stories we always wish for a happy ending.  The ending of this book puts you back into the reality of things--there are no happy endings to the Holocaust.     I can only think of a few children's novels that leave adult readers contemplating about the world as you are reading. This is one of them. It will leave you thinking. Hopefully it will have children seeing the world in another light as well.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly Clarkson far outshines her pop contemporaries on this cd.  Mainly because she can actually, you know . . . sing.<br />A lot of the songs sound like \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" both in subject matter of the lyrics and the full-throated, booming chorus.  What caught me by suprise, though, were the softer songs on the album.  They reveal the quality and subtlety of her voice.<br />Seeing as how she got her start on American Idol, I did not think Kelly was much more than a media creation.  I grouped her in with Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Britney Spears.  After listening to My December I can see that Kelly Clarkson is in a whole other league.<br />Kelly Clarkson is one of the few good things to come from American Idol.  And while I was not completely blown away by My December, it is good enough to make me wonder about the possible directions her music may take her.

B000I2IT44|5.0|I'm a drummer and also have an interest in photography/ videography. Being a huge fan of Porcupine Tree, when I discovered this DVD, I bought it immediately. The band plays great as usual during this live show, but what really impressed me was the camera work. The video company who shot this DVD really knows music and found some of the best camera angles I've seen on a live show. Their use of focus shifting and colorization is spectacular. It goes without saying that the band's musicianship is awesome, and Gavin Harrison's drumming is inspiring. If you are a fan of Porcupine Tree, definitely buy this DVD.
B000RIWAVW|1.0|This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, and to be fair Anchor Bay does put out some good special edition DVDs for this title.  However I think its only fair to point out the obvious.  This is almost the same DVD that was released back in 1999 (Halloween: Restored Limited Edition).  Hopefully, this explains the single star rating.<br /><br />As all true Halloween fans already know, about a year ago all of the \\"lost footage\\" or the unused portions of the film that was left on the cutting room floor was discovered.  But this never-before-seen footage is not included on this DVD (not weaved into the original film or even available as an extra).  I was really hoping to see some of this \\"lost footage\\" but it looks like we Halloween fanatics are in store for a longer wait.<br /><br />I visited the Anchor Bay website to get the details on this latest Halloween installment.  Here they are:<br /><br />Features:<br />-Widescreen Presentation enhanced for 16x9 TVs<br /><br />-Full-Frame Presentation<br /><br />-Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />-TV Spots<br /><br />-Radio Spot<br /><br />-Talent Bios<br /><br />-Still Gallery<br /><br />-Behind the Scenes Still Gallery<br /><br />-Featurette: Halloween Unmasked 2000

B00000JLWW|5.0|There's nothing wrong with telling a love story against the background of a real-life historical event. That's what Margaret Mitchell did with \\"Gone with the Wind\\", one of the most successful films ever made from a huge best-seller. And \\"Titanic\\" is certainly not to be classified as a documentary, thereby making comparisons to \\"A Night to Remember\\" (which WAS done in the style of a documentary) totally unreasonable. Cameron's achievement here is undeniable, despite some of the negative responses.<br /><br />\\"Titanic\\" is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives. Told in a flashback technique, it focuses mainly on Jack and Rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicide--but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot, adding to the intrigue and conflict.<br /><br />The class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity--making complaints from previous \\"commentators\\" meaningless when they say that the film doesn't even deal with this factor. The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose's class-conscious mother.<br /><br />TITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen--masterful in all departments. The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent--but no one has given enough credit to Billy Zane. He's the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest. David Warner is another first class villain and he's excellent, as is Gloria Stuart (as old Rose) and Bill Paxton.<br /><br />The Jack/Rose love affair is played with considerable skill by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, putting emphasis on the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy. All of the supporting performances, including Kathy Bates as \\"the unsinkable Molly Brown\\", are cast to perfection.<br /><br />The technical credits are beyond reproach with a standout recreation of the famous ship itself, and James Horner's score adds immeasurably to the film's poignancy and drama.<br /><br />Summing up: A voyage to remember for the ages.a standout recreation of the famous ship itself, and James Horner's score adds immeasurably to the film's poignancy and drama.

B000002GQK|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles, but then in 1969, thru a friend, discovered the Moody Blues and they became my lifetime favorite. In the 70's, I saw them perform many times in NY and anxiously ran out to buy every new album the first day of release.  I have to admit as the years passed on, I never replaced my vinyl LP's with CD's and stopped listening to this incredible band and have now just recently bought two Moodies CD's thru Amazon and will continue until I have all of them.  I just bought \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" and I can't stop playing it. After all these years I remember every note, every word, every feeling I had back then and I feel the same way now.  To D. Berryman - it does my heart good to hear of a new Moodies fan - you have a wonderful, fantastic treat in store for you.  Each album is a treasure. You must buy \\"Bluejays\\" - Justin and John's album from 1976. I literally played that record every day for 4 years and in 1980, when I met Justin while vacating in Cornwall, England, I told him that, and he was pleased.    I do believe, though, that no other album has affected me the way \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" did the first time I heard it as a 19-year old.   A magic, cosmic, dreamy experience that has not been duplicated since then.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.<br /><br />Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. His role is the focal point throughout most of the action--so perfect in his characterization that he makes the story an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.<br /><br />His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. Nothing, it seems, is pictured in terms of black and white. All the gray areas are visible. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.<br /><br />Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.<br /><br />An inspired, thought-provoking piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.<br /><br />Highly recommended for mature audiences.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Despite some of the negative comments, this is well worth seeing for the awesome special effects alone. I wish the armchair critics would stop trying to analyze the \\"logic\\" behind this project and sit back and enjoy a good blockbuster thrill ride, which is obviously the aim of director Roland Emmerich. It's not meant to be a serious documentary about global warming. Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.<br /><br />My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.<br /><br />Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize that scientifically, it's all in the realm of creative imagination rather than fact.<br /><br />The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the thrill ride!! Yeah, baby, it's cold outside!!

B000QXDED6|4.0|I liked the movie and all but I'm not happy that theirs no special content on the dvd.  I think that it's a b**** move on WB's part to put out another dvd version with the special content they brag about with a higher price.  Hell makes me wish that I had a PS3 so I could get the blu-ray version.
B000002542|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites. There is no Steve Perry on this CD, so if that is the style of music your looking for I would suggest you buy something else. However, this CD is a gift to music based on it's own merit. Gregg Rolie's voice is soothing, Neal Schon is actually allowed to really express himself through his guitar playing, and this CD is full of excellent songs/musicianship. Honestly, there is not one bad song on this. If your looking for progressive 70's music this CD is a must have. The song \\"Of A Lifetime\\" is worth the ten dollars you will spend on this alone. Don't be left out in the dark. If you have never heard this CD your missing out on a musical masterpiece.
067003830X|3.0|The Brain That Changes Itself is a brilliant multi-faceted book,  scintillating with information on divers aspects of the plasticity of the brain. What a pity,in the light of this dazzling acchievement, that Dr. Doidge's opening chapter,\\"A Woman Perpetually Falling\\" should be in many respects misleading.  In dealing with the case of Cheryl Schiltz, he accurately describes the symptoms of gentamicin toxicity from which Cheryl suffers but inaccurately says that gentamicin is toxic only if given in excessive amounts. On the contrary, there are well documented instances of gentamicin toxicity after from one to five days. His account of Cheryl's treatment by the sensory-substitution device BrainPort is anecdotal and plausible but he fails to document how Cheryl became eligible for treatment by BrainPort; he fails to mention that this device, only recently approved for sale in Europe and Canada, is still undergoing clinical trials in the USA, where it has not yet been approved. He does not mention that its price is $10,000.00 (in Canada), a sum far beyond the means of most patients who have been damaged by gentamicin, many of whom, like Cheryl before BrainPort, have had their ability to earn a living drastically reduced by gentamicin damage.  This chapter, while alerting readers to the damage gentamicin can do, may mislead them into thinking that losing one's balance is  of no importance, since the effects can be alleviated by an electric device. It makes a lovely story with a happy ending: one wobbler plucked from  the thousands who have been damamaged by gentamicin. But one instance does not make a case expecially when Dr. Doige fails to provide esseential information. It is a pity, too, that his opening chapter belies the title of his book. Cheryl's brain did  not \\"change itself\\"; it was changed by a machine. Dr. Doidge might better have studied the brains of the thousands of gentamicin-damaged patients who have trained their own brains to instruct their feet to move through a world that seems to be in perpetual motion. There's a subject for his next book.

0316018953|3.0|THE OVERLOOK is the latest Harry Bosch novel released by Michael Connelly. This book, previously released in serial form, is about half as long as a regular Bosch novel. I'm a fan of Connelly and I've only read 5 or 6 of his books but have to admit I'm disappointed in this book. First, considering it's length, you are getting half the novel you usually get from Connelly. Knowing that, the content of the novel has to be judged even more critically, ie. quality, not quantity. In the Bosch books I've read, they've always been short on twists and turns. They've been more like straight forward procedurals that slowly grow on you as the novel moves on. In The Overlook, the novel doesn't have a chance to build up steam, it has to capture you right away. And I don't beleive it does.<br /><br />Harry is awake, at home around midnight, when he recieves a call. He's a homicide detective now and there's been a murder. Harry calls his new partner Iggy to meet him there. Stanley Kent was murdered at the Overlook, a scenic spot in Hollywood that looks out over the city. Rachel Walling, an FBI agent that Bosch has a history with, also shows up at the scene. The FBI is also highly interested in Stanley Kent. Kent worked in the medical profession with cesium, a highly radioactive material used to treat cancer. Because of the cesium, the FBI believes there may be a possible terrorist angle to the case. Bosch goes to the Kent house and finds his wife, Alicia, naked and hog-tied in the bed.<br /><br />We learn all that in the opening, and the middle part of the book is what disappointed me. First, since this book is so short, there isn't much room for plot twists and turns. In this book there isn't any. Connelly details the investigation in extreme detail, and unfortunately, none of the details are very interesting. Second, Connelly establishes that the primary conflict in the novel will be jurisdiction. Harry wants the case since it is a homicide. The FBI is more concerned about the national security angle. The novel follows Bosch going back and forth with Walling, backstabbing, playing politics, all in the name of jurisdiction. I'm sure law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction problems all the time, but as a plot device in a novel, it gets old. And it especially doesn't work as the central conflict that drives the novel.<br /><br />Now, the novel has strong points as well. I've found many Connelly novels to focus on what seems to be boring details, only to have the details come back to matter later. That is true in THE OVERLOOK as well. Every seemingly tedious observaiton Bosch makes in the beginning plays a part in how the case is solved. Bosch fans will enjoy this novel, as I did, because of its brevity and because Bosch is his usual self. I didn't much care for Connelly's commentary on the motives of the FBI in the case, but that really doesn't play a part in the quality of the book. I recommend this to all Bosch fans, but I certainly wouldn't pay full price for a book this short.angle.

B000OPOANE|5.0|The next great CD from Rush. Now Rush is on the cutting edge of technology by releasing an MVI DVD. The songs come in MP3 and allow you to burn an audio CD or load them directly onto your MP3 player. It also comes with great backgrounds, lyrics and extra features you will love. Not to mention that the new music is great as always. Malignant Narcissism keeps up with the famous Rush instrumentals of the past, with its Bass and Drum solos although at 2:17 is not as long as I would have liked it to be. The spirituality of the songs is blatant but not overpowering to the music and Rush has hit another one out of the park.
B00005R62K|5.0|To me, Stained Class may be the last of its kind. I love all Priest (At least with Halford), but I think that Stained Class was the last time that Priest were so serious (well Exciter isn't 100 percent serious), so dark, so epic and intense. Also, I think it is Priest's heaviest album before Painkiller (Especially for the time). There is not one song that is filler, there is not even one second on this album that is wasted. The jazzy, progressive influenced Les Binks (who departed one record and one live album after this) would be greatly missed and replaced by the far more pedestrian Dave Holland (though he was great on Priest...Live), also contributes riffs and ideas to one of the greatest epic ballads of all time, Beyond the Realms of Death.<br /><br />We begin with Exciter, which like Painkiller after it, flaunts their new drummer's amazing double bass skills. I would defy anyone to find songs that were played this fast for this time (other than say, Motorhead or others, BUT then again maybe not) and also as intense. Congratulations Priest, you just invented speed metal!<br /><br />White Heat, Red Hot is just as the title says, a 70's metal (beyond proto-metal at this point) firestorm of hot riffage, and vocal intensity.<br /><br />Better By You, Better than Me is another classic, its a cover, but I sincerly think that Priest made it their own (in the same way that Led Zeppelin made their (uncredited) cover of Jake Holmes' Dazed and Confused their own).<br /><br />Stained Class continues the onslaught of METAL intensity, and its just another example of Halford's progressively genius lyric writing. Halford's lyrics cut much deeper (in my opinion) back then, whether he was contemplating the meaning of life, doing some type of social commentary, or even discussing a mythological beast, he wrote about it all back then!<br /><br />Invader is another classic, and Saints in Hell makes its doomier prescence known. Savage is lyrically similar to the later Iron Maiden song \\"Run to the Hills\\", and Beyond the Realms of Death and Heroes End end the album in intense precision.<br /><br />To me, this is one of the essential metal albums. It defines \\"thinking man's metal\\" even before the term was invented (and before \\"heavy metal\\" itself was a widespread term), and is the forerunner to nearly every progressive, epic or power metal band that came later. Its all there, contained within these grooves, or now laser etchings.<br /><br />Priest to me would get more and more mainstream after this release, and even though thats not bad, I still think this had more of an impact in the history of metal than some of the later albums.<br /><br />Pretty much all the songs are heavy and somewhat fast on this album (other than the ballad) and it doesn't let up. Its almost like Priest's version of Deep Purple's In Rock, or their Master of Reality.alms of Death and Heroes End end the album in intense precision.

Watch it along with Why We Fight, and you will have an eye-opening experience.  You don't have to feel sorry for MacNamara, but you owe yourself the chance to listen to him articulate what he has learned and how much he regrets.  Not to get too specific, but I think you will see a frightening parallel between the war in Vietnam and more current wars.      This is not propaganda. There is no bias or agenda set down by the filmmaker. You are not asked to sympathize with MacNamara.  It's straight talk.

B000OQF6N6|1.0|Zeitgeist is a major disappointment. It is very immature and sloppy, which is strange coming from such a perfectionist. Billy's vocals are dreadful, so much for the singing lessons!

B000MRAAJM|3.0|I chose to purchase the BBC version, as I have no problem with R. Attenborough, BBC did the original project and the price with no shipping charges was unbeatable (about $66).  I absolutey fell in love with the series on Discovery HD Channel through Comcast and wanted to see the highest resolution images of this series possible on our new 1080P LCD.  However, I am very disapointed in the grainy/snowy picture, which displays on my brand new Sony 40\\" 1080P TV via HDMI cables.  I have to crank down the TV sharpness to 2/3rds to obscure the grain.  Picture was actually worse than the Discovery Channel HD recording, which is compressed, in 1080i and using the same HDMI cables to the TV.  I initially played it on the Sony PS3, which has some limitations, but it was also grainy on a dedicated Sony Blu-Ray player.  I even tried several expensive HDMI cables, without luck.  Then I purchased the Discovery HD Blu-Ray version (with Sigourney Weaver) for almost twice the price and it also has a much sharper picture than the BBC Blu-Ray version.  The BBC Blu-Ray versoin appears to have encoding problems.  I am considering returning this as a defective product.
B000RJO578|5.0|Hot Fuzz is one of the few current DVD movies I've bought... That's why I'm here. It is a remarkable parody of Tough Guy films with lots of layers. It also has several logical plot twists and brilliant foreshadowing that is clear only with hindsight. It is said that the best comedy is done strait as if it is a serious drama... and this film is an exemplar of that axiom
B00014NE62|5.0|Sometimes the best adaptations are those which do the least amount of adapting. That is, they more or less just put the dialogue as it is in the book onto the screen. In that respect, the novel by E.M. Forster must be a director's dream, because the dialogue is sharp and already reads like a script (a bit like \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" by Waugh). And I am glad to say, this minimal approach is what Merchant/Ivory used here, so almost all the best scenes in the novel are also in the movie (and the rest are in the  deleted scenes, which are also included on the DVDs).    \\"Maurice\\" has often been called a lesser work by Forster, likes Gide's \\"Corydon\\" a mere effort to justify the author's homosexuality. However, while the topic was obviously important to Forster, the novel does not sacrifice style for message. The overall construction of plot and characters is very clear and straightforward and less flowery than his other novels. When his other books are heavy in \\"female dialogue\\", this one ultimately maintains that deeds are more important than words (and in fact Maurice says so in the beginning), and that physical love is more worthwhile than the upper-class discussing how the have a piano removed from under a crack in the ceiling. So in a way \\"Maurice\\" satirizes Forster's earlier works, and maybe that is why many Forster fans don't seem to like it.    I was initially a bit apprehensive about the choice of cast, since Wilby does not exactly look like I imagined the character from the novel and Graves is a bit too much the 1980s pretty boy to be believable as the rugged groundskeeper. Also, Grant has been mostly playing annoying roles ever since the \\"Four Funerals...\\", so I was not expecting much of him here. But fortunately, the performances are all very good and -- in the case of Grant -- almost make you forget all the low-quality movies he has been in since.    When I picked this title up I did not even realize it was from the Criterion Collection (it is only mentionedin tiny type on the back cover -- why?), so you actually get two DVDs, one with the movie, the other with extras. The transfer looks exquisite and really brings out the cozy interiors as well as the rainy and foggy outdoors (again, comparisons to the \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" adaptation with Jeremy Irons seem apt, and besides Phoebe Nicholls also stars in that).    The predictable extra features are present, like interviews and deleted scenes. You can tell the interviews were filmed with an American audience in mind when the three principal actors endlessly go on about how _they_ themselves are completely heterosexual (only Graves allows for a streak of bisexuality) and how difficult it was to do the love scenes.    This reminds me of the coverage of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" -- apparently you can only make a film with gay themes for Americans if you assure the audience that (a) the actors are straight and (b) they absolutely had no fun at all when filming the intimate scenes. It makes you wonder who is more emotionally stunted, Edwardian England or modern America.    But that aside, the deleted scenes are all very interesting and I wish they would have remained in the movie. So did Ivory himself in his commentary. I  would like to know why directors always like to cut 20-30 minutes from their movies only to later complain that they should have left the material in in the first place.    One of the things that is gone is the part when Maurice, in a sort of sexual frenzy, mounts a probably ill-advised seduction attempt on Dr Barry's 16-year-old nephew Dickie. Perhaps it is understandable this was left out, although this might have made Maurice's character a bit less angelic and more well-rounded. But it would also have been an easy target for detractors of the movie.    While it was a better idea to tell the first have half of a movie _not_ in a flashback as in the rough cut, we are missing some little moments here and there, such as when Maurice sees Alec flirting with some of the housemaids. A minor touch, but a reminder that Alec, like perhaps many members of the working-class, should really be considered bisexual. That is, his sexual orientation is not a conscious matter of inquiry of him, he just does what seems to feel right at the moment. That is of course also why a homosexual fling with Maurice is not a big problem to him.    Perhaps the main problem with the movie is that we see too much of Alec too soon, and from his point-of-view (e.g., the camera is behind his back when he is first seen stealing some pastries from a coffee table). In the novel,  more distant glimpses of Scudder are gotten from Maurice's POV, who vacillates between attraction and disdain for him as a member for the lower classes.    The moment where Alec climbs into Maurice's bedroom is also not as well handled as in the novel -- in the novel Maurice calls out into the night (at no one in particular), only to have Alec appear on the ladder, which is more surprising and romantic. In the movie, we see Alec watching Maurice from the park as he climbs out the window himself and rocks the ladder. The surprise is spoilt, because we identify at that moment more with Alec than with Maurice.    Another change from the book concerns Clive's sudden motivation to \\"become\\" heterosexual. In the movie, an Oscar Wilde-like trial takes place that scares Clive into mending his ways. Then again, I always felt that Clive's 180° turn is actually quite easy to understand, because there really is no change at all: In the beginning, he effuses about Platonic love, which to him is an idea, not a physical reality. In the second half, he is equally exuberant about marriage, but again more as an idea than something sexual (his wife does not look like she gets much sex, or even expects it from her husband). Clive and Maurice are vastly different in that regard -- to Clive love is an idea, separate from reality, while to the less intellectually inclined Maurice it cannot be divorced from sex. And that is why their relationship goes nowhere.    But those are really only minor quibbles. All in all this a sumptuous adaptation of a well-conceived novel. Some adaptations change the plot or dialogue for no reason and make you wish that they had simply stuck to the source, but this one is smart in that it lets Forster's writing, its beautiful photography, and its evocative, wistful score speak for themselves.

B000KQF6X0|4.0|I won't go in to about the film, if you've already clicked on the link then you will know the jist of the film already.  I have to admit I've been looking forwards to this release qutie a bit since it was first anounced, and I'm pleased to say it doesn't disapoint.    the picture quality for a pre-hd era film is quite simply amazing, you can seen right down to the scuff marks on the biker jacket at the begining, and I'm please to say that compaired to the standard DVD edition the dark areas finally appear clear like they did in the cinema complex all them years ago instead of the mush that was hastly rushed out on DVD in the first place.     The only complant picture wise I have is it kind of looks a little soft whether that is a process of re-scanning the film or how the director intented I don't know, all I know is this is the best qualtiy I've ever seen this picture in.    sound wise has come into a complete revelation. their are times in the film where you just wonder if the sound was comming from outside instead of being on the disk, if your player can handle it switch to DTS6.1 and see what I mean, maybe its taste prefrence but the EX soundtrack didn't have quite the same bite to it.    All in all I'm very happy with it 4* if you haven't seen the film and have Blu-ray get this belive me you won't be disapointed

B000007VCM|5.0|This album was an instant classic! As other reviwers have mentioned...GOOD LUCK picking a favorite...seriously it has all of what makes an album a classic. From my first experience listening to the Cult I was hooked on the Angelic vocals and dreamy guitar. They were something more than just another alternative rock group...they had a touch of blues and a unique sound altogether...i have NO CLUE how they never got bigger. One thing is painfully obvious with them is that they were WELL before their time! Had they not released their music until at least 10-15 years later they would be all over Mtv as well as all the Radio stations. This album is a must for those of u out there seeking  an original, ROCKING but musical sound...they really have it all! Favorite tracks on this cd of mine include; Brother Wolf... Sister Moon, She Sells Santuary( their hit off of this cd), Nirvana, & last but not least Black Angel...as you can see i listed half the album...enough said...this band is destined to be re-discovered as i have faith in the world of music...thank you, your humble narrator, Alex D.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Did anyone denouncing the jealous rages of Tinker Bell, the petty antics of the mermaids or Peter's sometimes cruel spirit actually read the original book?  No?  I didn't think so.<br /><br />What is left to say?  This movie is a Disney classic and holds a special place in the hearts of many adults.  However, the indirect racism and stereotypes may not be appropriate for todays audience and their parent's undue concerns with political correctness and empowering views of femininity.<br /><br />The film is very dated, but no more than the other animated features from this time period.  The film also doesn't accurately reflect the original novel, but none of Disney's Classics hold very true to their inspirations.<br /><br />This film is a beautiful example of light hearted entertainment of a bygone era.  The old Disney Classics are in a league all their own and modern children's movies just can't touch them.<br /><br />If you are a parent concerned with the indirect racism and old fashioned views just look to the humor in today's children's films.  Sexual innuendo, toilet humor, political stabs, many of which go over the heads of the little ones.  What makes outdated stereotypes any worse than the derogatory humor used in today's CGI cinematography?<br /><br />At least these older films are intelligent and encourage children to dream big and use their imaginations.<br /><br />The Platinum Edition of Peter Pan is a must have for any Disney collection.  As your children get older show them the other adaptations, such as the live action and encourage them to read the book.  There's no reason not to challenge a child.  That's what these Classics did, they opened doors to other means of enjoyment and enrichment for children.  A lot of parents today really miss that point.
0061142026|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It doesn't just tell the story of a trip from the mundane world into faerie, it tells the story of a boy becoming a man, and how he gains knowledge of himself and his world while doing so.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that the story could have been longer. In the hands of a less-gifted author it could have been a fantasy trilogy still going after ten books. That Gaiman left so much to the reader's imagination is a good thing in my opinion. Leaving so much out underlines just how vast and mysterious faerie is.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I have several older movies I sometimes plug into at night as a sleep aid , but this film won't even make it into my snoozer stash. It's too loud and intrusive to fall asleep on. An absolute waste. The one star is for Kate Beckinsale , she had the only fake accent that didn't grate on my last nerve. The special features promise a movie that must have been sent to an alternate universe. Why do I have a copy ? I got it for Christmas. I'm glad it tanked at the box office , a sequel is just too horrid to consider.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album is stunning, all the way around.  Musically, you can't find a better quote, \\"Metalcore\\" band than All That Remains: the incredibly solid guitar team of Oli Herbert (whose guitar tone and style is very reminiscent of Soilwork's Peter Wichers) and Mike Martin, with their gallop-picking riffs 'a plenty, the monstrous, vomit-inducing/sickening drum work of Shannon Lucas...  And then you have, undoubtedly one of the greatest metal vocalists around representing his multi-varied range, from death metal cookie monster growls, rabid screams, and over-the-top melodic singing, Mr. Brutality himself, Phil Labonte!  What is amazing about this album is how catchy it is for being heavily-laden with death metal and even black metal influences abound.  There are also some obvious Soilwork-like groove metal with guitar harmonies galore.  This band really knows what they are doing.  Perhaps it's the polished production that makes it sound so solid and good, however, I have seen videos of this band live on YouTube, and they know how to bring it.  Needless to say, this is no run-of-the-mill cliche \\"Metalcore\\" band.  This is a band that has re-written the book and approach of the whole Metalcore genre, and defies being pigeon-holed into Metal Sub-genre.  All That Remains owns!

The special edition DVD has a documentary with two professor types arguing the artistic licensure of the film makers. They make some good points. Mostly everything is discussion based.

B00005JPQR|5.0|Just so you know, there are plot SPOILERS in this one.<br /><br />I read in an online interview that, while Matt Damon hasn't entirely ruled out filming a fourth Bourne installment, he's put the kibosh on doing one in the immediate future. If he does end up not doing any more, he goes out on a very high note. The Bourne movies have been consistently graced with intelligent scripts, diligent acting, and peerless production values. Oh, and nonstop adrenalin rushes. With THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, this series reaches its crescendo.<br /><br />The movie picks up with an injured Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) still being pursued in Moscow, Russia, where the prior film, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, ended. Bourne, of course, easily handles his predicament. The focus then shifts to a London journalist who's gotten a sniff of a potential headliner. Soon, his newspaper The Guardian is outing a front page story involving our amnesiac superspy, which naturally draws the eye of Bourne. The article also doesn't sit well with various clandestine government agencies (the CIA and the NSA). Specifically, one unhappy intelligence officer is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), who ramrods Blackbriar, the hush hush CIA black ops program ressurected from the ashes of Treadstone. Treadstone being the original project which trained and programmed assassins, of which Bourne was the primary guinea pig. Naturally, the paranoid Vosen wants to, once and for all, eliminate Bourne, who is the mother of all loose ends. But Jason Bourne, too, has had enough. After running for three years, he wants all the answers regarding his past. And he wants it now.<br /><br />THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is simply two hours of intricate and well choreographed entertainment. The film's got smarts and forces the viewer to constantly pay attention as it doesn't linger too much on any reveals. And when things get revved up and Jason goes into action mode, the jittery hand-held cameras evoke an atmosphere of immediacy and of things barely kept in check, even though we assume that Bourne knows exactly what he's doing. There are screaming car chases here and extended rooftop pursuits and plenty of frenetic scenes with Bourne outthinking, outrunning, and, when it comes to it, just plain outslugging the foot soldiers of his near omnipresent and overwhelmingly equipped opponents. Nothing cute about his fights, either. His one-on-one, life or death struggle with the assassin in Morocco takes your breath away with its speed and primal brutality. No posing or James Bond witticisms here as it's made clear that the only objective is to take the other guy out, promptly and without any wasted moves. However, my favorite scene in the film takes place in Waterloo Station as Bourne aids a targeted reporter and attempts to talk him thru to safety via cell phone. Never does a sequence put more of an exclamation point on just how resourceful this guy is and how fast on his feet he thinks.<br /><br />Our government agencies once more come under scrutiny. Again, we are reminded of the immensity and scope of the power and tools at their hands, and of how easily such things can be misused. It boggles my mind that any cell phone conversation you may have can be accessed and recorded for posterity, and your every little secret can be ferreted out just as offhandedly. In the parlance of these covert agencies, a mundane statement such as \\"Let's activate the asset\\" carries grim connotations. There's a bit of suggestiveness coming from the film as it presents these assets, or assassins, as unthinking automatons who linger in their hotel rooms as they await their next target. You get a feeling that, until they do receive their next assignment, there in their hotels they stay. On the other hand, Jason Bourne who's strayed from his programming, has come to display clear remorse. In one evocative scene, as he gazes at his bloodied knuckles, he breaks his silence by stating, \\"I can see the faces of everyone I've killed. I just don't knowtheir names.\\"<br /><br />The unassuming and formerly boyish-looking Matt Damon was 36 years old during the filming of this, and while he still looks unassuming, the boyishness has given way to more lines on his face, which works to convey more weight to his character. Fortunately, there's enough warmth in Damon to keep his stoic and laconic super agent from becoming robotic and too impersonal for the audience. As he goes thru his memory loss, performs his amazing feats, and takes a lickin' but keeps on tickin', one can sense the internal conflict going on. Matt Damon has never been known for his loquaciousness, and his natural reserve and everyday guy demeanor serve him well in this role.<br /><br />He's backed ably by a cast of veteran actors. As the main villain, David Strathairn nicely personifies the burueacratic mentality of Bourne's adversaries. It's not personal with these bad guys, they're just trying to clear out some red tape. Meanwhile, Scott Glenn has such a minimal role that I'm ambivalent about his performance. Returning to the fold are the very good Joan Allen as the agent with principles, Pamela Landy, and lovely Julia Stiles, who gets an expanded part as Nicky Parsons. A prior history with Bourne, possibly a personal one, is hinted at by Stiles' character, so it's unfortunate that their story arc seems to sputter out.<br /><br />With the cast and crew trotting the globe as they film on location in Moscow, Paris, Madrid, London, Tangier, and New York, it's no wonder Matt Damon wants to take a break. But it's all been worth it, to have this wonderful capper in the trilogy. Finally, we learn of Jason Bourne's true identity. Of course, if you've read Robert Ludlum's novels, you would've been privy to it by now. But never mind. After all that Jason Bourne went thru, I felt a sense of relief for him as he finally got some answers and received a sense of  closure. And, going by the raucous audience reaction at the final moments played out on the screen, I wouldn't count out another sequel. But, hopefully, Mattie's in it.their names.\\"<br /><br />The unassuming and formerly boyish-looking Matt Damon was 36 years old during the filming of this, and while he still looks unassuming, the boyishness has given way to more lines on his face, which works to convey more weight to his character.

1841591009|5.0|The Code of the Woosters, by the inimitable P. G. Wodehouse, is a fun and enjoyable romp with Bertie Wooster and his Man Jeeves.  This novel features numerous plotlines, including but not limited to, the battle over a cow creamer, a lost notebook, romantic entanglements, the theft of a policeman's helmet, a potential jail sentence for Bertie, a dictator, and more romantic entanglements.  Each plotline is brought to a conclusion by the brilliance of \\"Plum\\" the excellent English humorist.  The book is full of hilarious one liners and brilliant wit.  Amazingly, this novel was first published in 1938, yet it is still full of timely situations.<br /><br />This novel of classic comedy introduces us to Totleigh Towers and its owner, Sir Watkin Bassett.  Several memorable mainstay characters are in this book including Gussie Fink-Nottle, Aunt Dahlia, Madeline Bassett, and Stiffy Bing.  Any journey taken with Wooster and Jeeves is time well spent.  This classic series endures because the characters are wonderful and memorable.  A 5 star fun-filled romp.

B000MRA5EM|5.0|I loved it, the water is crystal clear, the different creatures and life that were addressed were fascinating, and educational. The narration was very well timed. The notes of humor were appreciated.  It is a great IMAX film, as always wish it were longer!!!
0307341550|5.0|I read much more nonfiction than fiction, but picked this book up at an airport a few days ago.  Usually, such purchases are a waste of my money and time.  Not so this time!      I read it in two days and was disappointed my flight wasn't longer so I could've finished it in one sitting.  The subject matter was disturbing on a couple different levels.  But I couldn't help myself, I really enjoyed it.  Like a bad accident, I couldn't stop reading.  And the narrator, while imperfect and sad, was very easy to sympathize with.  The writing was easy to read and felt effortless.  A nice work from a first time author.  Like so many other readers here, I will look forward to Gillian Flynn's next novel.  Well done.
B000002AS3|5.0|This is oasis's debut album... and it is their best, all the song's seem to flow together very well.    Rock N Roll star- this is the first track off D.M and it represents everything oasis is... a great rocking opener.    Shakemaker- This was going to be released as oasis's first single.. and it is not hard to find out why.. its a fine example of noel gallagher's nonsensical lyrics with a catchy tune.    Live Forever- this might be a cliche but this is my favorite song on the album, there is just something so magical about it.. to the catchy melody, to one of noel gallaghers best solo's.. played in the key of G.. it sounds  very much like a undiscovered beatle's tune.    Up in the sky- this is a very good filler song about rebellion.    Columbia- Another amazing song by oasis, it is a perfect example of shoegazing music,  With the most absurd lyrics, catchy chorus and all the instruments unidentifiable from each other.    Supersonic- One of the great rockers in this album, the guitar work in this is amazing, it is hard to believe a song could be this great with lyrics such as \\"i know a girl called elsa, shes into alka seltzer,she sniff through her cane in her supersonic train\\".    Bring it on down- another filler track, it fits well into the album (also the filler tracks on the album make it better in a sense).    Cigarettes and alcohol- The riff is the same as t-rexs \\"get it on\\" but for some reason you can't help but like this song..    Digsy's dinner- Very laughable, great song with a insider's joke if you care to read more about it.    Slide away- Oasis's first love song... Liam really shines here in his singing ability, You can't help but sing along with the chorus, although noel's acoustic version is very fine if you can find that (note that this is the only oasis album where noel does not sing any of the songs A-sides)    Married with children- Not the way you would expect oasis to end this amazing album, a acoustic only, Minor key song, but the more listens you give it, the better it is, very under-rated.     So all in all this is oasis, you either hate or love them, you either love Liam gallaghers sneering vocals or you don't, you either love the draining  production or you can't stand it, you either tolerate oasis's cocky attitudes or you dont... I personally love the album every bit it deserves.
0440238609|5.0|The trilogy is very well written: all the parts flow together well and the ending brings the series to a close. You can't ask for more in a story.    A small complaint I had was that The Golden Compass had a little star in the corner of the cover that said \\"Motion Picture coming in 2007\\". I would have preferred that my book not have that, and the picture in the Amazon description didn't show it. But just a minor complaint.
1594489505|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Khaled did an amazing job expressing the lives of Afghan women. I was once again unable to set the book down. From the moment the book arrived, I read it cover to cover without interuptions.     Khaled has a very special gift recreating real life experiences in his stories. This book moved me to tears of anquish and anger, over what the main characters went through, to tears of relief and joy. I learned something from the book too. \\"Strength of will.\\"    If you read the Kite Runner you will love A Thousand Splendid Suns!

0517223546|4.0|Sarum is the sweeping epic of England, a rich history that blends the ancient and the modern, beginning with the Ice Age 10,000 years ago and transporting the reader through the worlds of Stonehenge, the Black Death, the Industrial Age, World War II, and ending in modern times. It follows the fortunes of five families: Wilson, Godfrey, Shockley, Mason, and Porteus. Witness how changes in political, social, and economic climates affect these families and witness how the landscape is transformed over time. From the unspoiled land of the five rivers to the ritual and spiritual centers of Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral to the bustling commercial and industrial centers of the modern age, Rutherfurd interweaves history with fiction to create a seamless tale that will endure across the ages.<br /><br />Though several chapters seem to drag with the story and characters, you can still learn a lot about the history of England -- many parts of the novel actually read like a history book -- and you will learn how the country arrived at its modern state. You will understand how the social climate changed dramatically with the coming of the Black Death and how the legislative system developed over time to make England unique. I particularly enjoyed the earlier chapters, those dealing with the Stone Age, the Roman occupation, the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, and the medieval period, which included the construction of the famous Salisbury Cathedral. I felt the stories and characters were much more entertaining than those in part two of the book, \\"New Sarum.\\" Despite the slow going of some of the chapters, Rutherford's impressive storytelling ability does not get lost in all the history.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read. Rutherfurd seems to have done his research well, though as with all historical books, I'm sure there will be debate concerning the accuracies of various parts. It's a book you will want to read more than once, as much for the entertainment as for the history.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|This is a great collection for anyone who's not exactly the most fanatical fan but is decently obsessed. The movies are in great condition. While there are a lot of featurettes, I do wish they were longer. Otherwise, there isn't a better collection of the Matrix Trilogy elsewhere.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We saw some of the episodes on TV here in Australia and bought the set to watch the rest.  Really stunning.  There is one problem though, some of the playback, especially aerial footage, is sort of jerky... I wonder if it is an issue with the discs or our Yamaha DVD player... certainly never seen that before.  Glad if anyone could shed some light.  Cheers  Georgie
B000OCXMAE|2.0|After spending the time to listen to the whole CD, I've never been sooooo disappointed!  Other than the lead vocal's voice, it doesn't sound like Linkin Park.  I hope on the next one (if this doesn't bury them) goes back to the old Linkin Park sound (the one that made them great).
B000002J6H|5.0|Stephen Stills' self-titled solo debut album is a great release from the most important musical contributor to Crosby, Stills & Nash. Aside from the overplayed (and annoying) \\"Love The One You're With\\" (I know a young woman who uses Proactiv to keep her skin clear so she won't get asked for a dance to that irritating song), this is a great CD, with such songs as \\"Go Back Home\\", \\"Sit Yourself Down\\", and many others implying that if you want to look good for your significant other and/or your favorite celebrity, you need to keep roots in where you came from and take the time to relax and reflect. The same themes resonated through other Stills albums, both with and without CSN (and Y). Stills' opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|I loved it while it was on, but a month later I find myself dismissing much of what I felt at the time.  After a month away, I now say, yes, Ryan Gosling was great, and so was the young woman who p;ays \\"Drey,\\" his student, and Anthony Mackie is the greatest actor of his generation.  I like the way the movie didn't try to \\"explain\\" everything like why Dan was addicted to crack and how he got on the path to ruin.  I do agree that Ryan should have won the Oscar.  Though I hope he never has to play so anguished a part again (looks like he's signed up for the new Peter Jackson film of THE LOVELY BONES so my hope is shot).  (Watch out, he'll be making that same gesture of anguish he's used from the beginning of his career--watch for it--squinching up his eyes while simultaneously pulling at his nose with his fist.  In HALF NELSON he does it eleven times, or approximately once every reel.)<br /><br />[SPOILERS INVOLVED.)<br /><br />So what's my beef?  I don't know, after thinking about it I was just sort of lackluster.  I didn't like that uncomfortable gulp after the movie when you're thinking, \\"Gee, am I dumb, or did they call the movie HALF NELSON for some reason I completely missed?\\"  I didn't like the suggestions of romance between the teen girl and her teacher.  The ending scene was pretty outrageous in this regard, setting them up as a couple with a future filled with possibility.  It was the traditional happy ending--for a romance movie.  Certainly Ryan had more chemistry with Shareeka Epps than he did with his old girlfriend, played by Tina Holmes.  Other reviewers have praised Tina Holmes for her luminosity.  But me and my wife were sitting there and when she came on screen we debated whether or not to turn off the tape.  \\"Oh let's keep it on, maybe she won't be in the movie long.\\"  She isn't, but she nearly sinks it.  It's not just that she can't act in the traditional sense, but it's also that we keep remembering her from her role in SIX FEET UNDER, where she played James Cromwell's daughter, Maggie, the sweet little thing whose butter wouldnn't melt in her mouth but who stole Nate right from under Brenda's nose on the even of their wedding, then killed him!<br /><br />(SPOILERS OVER.)<br /><br />Plus, isn't she about 10 years older than Ryan?  I thought they were supposed to be high school sweethearts--maybe she was his teacher like Nicole Kidman in TO DIE FOR.  That would explain the haunted look in her eyes, as though regretting the past when she had seduced this underage teen Romeo.  That same haunted look was also shared by another actress, Karen Chilton, the woman who plays Drey's mother, the security guard who works too many shifts to give her daughter any guidance.  All she does is stare out the window looking haunted.  The director, Ryan Fleck, must have called her and Tina Holmes into his office at the same time and handed them each the same notes, \\"Look haunted.\\"<br /><br />But enough complaints.  Overall the movie is worth watching, if a bit painful and overdetermined.  The acting is good, even Tina Holmes, that maneater, is good.  People complain that Ryan and Shareeka were robbed of Oscars, but their time will come!  The most underappreciated performance in my eyes goes to the pair of jockey shorts Ryan Gosling in the film's staggering opening sequence where we see Ryan, still drugged up from the night before, sprawled on the floor of his shabby apartment.  The strain on those shorts must have been incredible and yet, they made it all the way through the scene.  They should have won the 2005 Emdurance Award for holding so much coiled power.ell's daughter, Maggie, the sweet little thing whose butter wouldnn't melt in her mouth but who stole Nate right from under Brenda's nose on the even of their wedding, then killed him!

0060887966|3.0|I liked THE ALCHEMIST, but didn't love it.  It starts out very well, but it quickly gets bogged down by excessive symbolism and a lot of detail that didn't seem essential to the story.<br /><br />The major point of this book is to pursue your life dreams, as opposed to making excuses for not doing so.  I certainly support this message, but I felt that Coelho took 165 pages to convey a relatively straightforward point.  This book is also heavily unrealistic in spots (the wind talks, the sun, etc.), which diminishes the power of its message, at least to me.<br /><br />I read the most recent trade paperback edition of THE ALCHEMIST, and would suggest that you read the four-page introduction by Paulo Coelho before purchasing this novel.  In that introduction, Coelho summarizes the main themes and ideas of THE ALCHEMIST in a crystal clear manner that I thought was more effective than the novel itself.  If the message resonates with you, then by all means buy this book and enjoy it.  Otherwise, you probably will not like it.

0141439785|5.0|An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas.  The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:<br />1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival.  Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.<br />2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.<br />3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused  by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.<br />4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.<br />5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.<br />6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.<br />  The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.<br />  As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written.

0446677450|4.0|Having spent over 30 years in the banking business, this is the first time I have seen someone put into words how to make money work for you.  This portrayal of working for money or letting it work for you is an outstanding lesson in life and how to not become rich, but to work better, not harder.  I commend the author on a unique way to look at entrepreneurship and its challenges of people and capital.  Allan
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Listening to this fab CD doesn't even compare to seeing the theatrical show along with the brilliant music of the Beatles, but it comes pretty darn close.

0792165020|5.0|The movie is an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel by the same name. The story line follows Highsmith, but there are notable departures. I find the movie adaptation to be brilliant. It is a psychologically complex movie that continues to probe deeper and deeper into issues of identity and moral conscience right up until the closing scene. Seeing the movie for the first time one might have the feel that director/writer Anthony Minghella is walking one through a tour of a grand old castle where rooms and corridors upon up into more rooms and corridors even more intriguing than the first.<br /><br />The film seems to divide into two movements. The first is the \\"age of innocence\\" for Tom Ripley. He is a boy with an opportunity and a hope for a better life: to escape his boring life of normalcy in New York for a life of beauty and taste. Where else, but Italy!??!<br /><br />While in Italy he is charged with bringing playboy Dickie Greenleaf back home to his wealthy father in the States. Dickie, however, has no interest, and Tom quickly realizes this and chooses to cast in his lot with Dickie and become fast friends. But Dickie is too fickle for the \\"brotherhood\\" that Tom craves. Hence the tension leads up to a moment of dramatic tragedy that forever changes the course of Ripley's life and ushers in the second movement of the film.<br /><br />There is now a turn towards suspense and intrigue as Tom uses his \\"talents\\" to gain a life of privilege and beauty. The narrative unfolds the suspense of Ripley trying to maintain multiple \\"worlds\\" and \\"realities\\" of deceit that Minghella describes as a myriad of \\"spinning plates,\\" and Matt Damon creates a character who skillfully holds all of these false realities together in a grand score that somehow makes sense to all the players despite the glaring inconsistencies that the audience can see.<br /><br />Holding this labyrinth of duplicity together would not have been possible without an absolutely incredible cast of actors and characters who come in and out of Ripley's life at every turn. The classical scenery also provides a setting where Damon can create his character of complexity.<br /><br />Ripley is desperate to escape the social and aesthetic \\"basement\\" of life, and for a while he seems to have succeeded. Yet despite his achievement he is left wondering whether he has not simply constructed another basement of moral and spiritual darkness. This is a character who begins a journey of discovering identity and finds himself trying to attain a new life through any means possible. But the events of Ripley's life play out like a tragedy and the grip of irony becomes tighter and tighter for Ripley as the road to his self discovery leads, as Minghella says, to \\"the annihilation of self.\\"ut of Ripley's life at every turn.

B000000WJZ|5.0|Lotta good stuff on this album, mostly very satisfying hard-rock crunch with a pile of guitar overdubs: \\"Cherub Rock\\", \\"Quiet\\", \\"Today\\", \\"Rocket\\"... these guys know how to rock, you know? And it is sincere. I've always loved this group's sincerity, and that's what makes so many of these songs fly. Take \\"Disarm\\" as an example. If anybody but Billy Corgan were singing it, it would have been a bloated, pompous mess of a song. However, his strong songwriting skills knock it out of the park. And it's just beautiful. The guy can't sing, but so what? The group also experiments with interesting song structures, such as on the multipart \\"Geek U.S.A.\\", \\"Mayonnaise\\", which has a hard-rock section, a ballad section, a psychedelic section and a hard-rock section; \\"Soma\\", which starts quiet, but ends up roaring: regardless, it's slightly overlong and one of the album's weaker tracks; and \\"Silverfork\\" (not its real title of course, but I can't use that word on amazon.com), which is very long but worthwhile: it does hard-rock, space-rock, a cutesy a capella bit, and a part of entirely white noise. I do think that \\"Spaceboy\\" is completely melodramatic, bathetic and bombastic, but I also think it's the only weak song on the album. Okay, \\"Sweet Sweet\\" isn't a great song either, but it's not even two minutes long. It ends before it begins. And following it is another beautiful piece of music, \\"Luna\\". In no way is this crappy TRL-endorsed mind-numbing uncreative alt-rock angst a la My Chemical Romance. This is sincere, resonant, powerful, excellent music.
B0000042GM|5.0|There may be the individual recording made by others - Gilels, Rubinstein, Arrau - of a particular piece which might be preferred but as a collection of the Brahms piano works, this set has to take the prize.    The quality of original recording is high and the digital transfer seemingly well done. One has to listen very attentively to detect which of the four Ballades were recorded monaurally; a strange anachronism in the 'sixties. Also, the piano is an unusually fine-sounding instrument and I wonder if it might not be the Bösendorfer which resided in Decca's Hampstead studios around the time these recordings were made.    As another reviewer has suggested, the accompanying notes in french and german do provide interestingly different perspectives. But what I find inexcusable is that neither of these, nor the text in english, offers any biographical or other information on the pianist. The title is \\"Brahms, Works for Solo Piano. Julius Katchen\\". That's it - Katchen dismissed! Despite there being two blank pages in the accompanying booklet and two more of irrelevant other releases by London, that is the only mention made anywhere of the artist. I find this not only irritating but offensive.     Julius Katchen was an American pianist who moved to post-War Paris at the age of twenty. He was the consummate musician with a broad performing repertoire; a very highly regarded soloist in his time - a time which included Rubinstein, Backhaus, Gilels, Horowitz, Moiseiwitsch and Solomon -  and a very empathetic accompanist but whose achievements like those of Witold Malcuzynski are not so well remembered today. This set serves to redress the balance a little and introduce Katchen to a new generation who surely will appreciate what in my view is the best available recording of the fiendishly difficult Paganini variations. His recording of the Brahms Opus 24 Handel variations (which are up there with Bach's Goldbergs for sheer breadth of musical invention) also is one of the best.     I recommend this set very highly.    As an unconnected aside, some fifty years ago and quite by chance, I found myself sitting next to Katchen on an aircraft. I remember he had unusually expressive hands; a useful attribute as the noise level of the DC3 cabin militated against easy conversation! At the time, I was wrestling with the G minor Rhapsody and he was very generous with his advice (and a free ticket to a recital the following evening!). A charming man who died prematurely in 1969.     Buy this set - I can't imagine why you would regret it.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead are my favorite current band, wtihout a doubt. In spite of that, I don't know where I stand at all on Amnesiac. Very little of this album is in the moody techno style of Kid A: the only songs I'd describe as \\"techno\\" are I May Be Wrong, Packt Like Sardines in a Crusht Tin Box, and Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors. Stylistically, this one's all over the map, even bringing in  a horn section that's obviously spent a bit too much time at the punch bowl on Life in a Glass House. That's not the problem: the problem with Amnesiac is that it contains some of Radiohead's greatest songs contrasted with some of their weakest.<br />Just about all of this album's first half qualifies as \\"strong\\". Packt Like Sardines etc. is a tad bit repetitive, but I like its \\"I'm a reasonable man, get off my case\\" motif, overused as it may be. Pyramid Song is a masterpiece, a piano-driven song with a bunch of chilling sound effects and the group's typical ellusive lyrics. It's one of my top five Radiohead songs. I May Be Wrong is quite good also, a techno-rocker with a surprising false end. If it weren't for the violent lyrics, I could easily see Knives Out as having been a huge radio hit, an amazing piece of folk with Thom Yorke's eerie vocals and some rather graphic imagery. You and Whose Army sounds great in all its underproduced glory. Oh, and I Might Be Wrong is pure techno that ranks with the best of Kid A.<br />Now, we get to the bad side. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors might be my least favorite Radiohead song: a scratchy techno beat and a disembodied electronic voice that sounds like it escaped from Fitter Happier lecturing us about secret doors and doors that open and doors that shut. If that's your idea of entertainment, cool. It's just not mine. I couldn't remember a thing about Dollars and Cents if my life depended on it: I do recall not liking the song, I just don't remember why. As an ambient transitional instrumental, the guitar solo Hunting Bears fails where Treefingers from the previous album worked. I'm not a fan of Life in a Glasshouse either; the loaded brass section is very distracting and exasperating. And why'd they remake Morning Bell and meld it with the title track? The cool time signature and the weird organ are sacrificed for an obnoxious chiming bell and a noable lack of imagination: the only good part of that song is Thom Yorke's falsetto, which you can hear in far better form on numerous other Radiohead songs. And Like Spinning Plates is worthless until Thom steps up to sing it and almost saves the day.<br />Sadly, Amnesiac is half a stunning record and half a debacle, and in truth it's not one of Radiohead's better albums. There are flashes of what had made The Bends, OK Computer and Kid A so good here and there: there are even a few full songs that easily rank among the best of those three albums. However, this also falls to some truly impressive (in a sense of the word) lows, so it's hard to recommend this very highly.ous album worked.

1594489505|5.0|How is it that some writers can blend depth and simplicity, happiness and sorrow, and beauty and disgust all in one amazing tale?  That is what Khaled Hosseini has done in A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />The book is the story of 2 women.  There is Mariam, an illegitimate daughter of her town's most respected businessman.  She lives in a hovel with her cynical and disillusioned mother.<br /><br />There is Laila, the daughter of a forward-thinking schoolteacher and a mother who is vibrant and outgoing.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts.  Part 1 is Mariam's story, which is filled with hopes, determination, and years of emotional numbness after circumstances force her into a harsh marriage.<br /><br />Part 2 is Laila's story, which is filled with love, tenderness, loss and redemption.  I don't want to give anything away, so forgive my sketchy descriptions.<br /><br />Part 3 is where these women's lives meet, then intersect, then become entwined out of circumstance, necessity, and, ultimately, sacrifice.<br /><br />Part 4 is where they part ways, each finding a new kind of peace and tranquility and even fulfillment.  Although they part ways, they are still very much entwined with each other.<br /><br />During the tales you see the disintegration of society in Afghanistan.  Happy families are torn apart by death and political upheaval.  Thriving cities are now piles of rubble ruled over by warlords who are merciless.  Rules are imposed that remind you of what the Jews had to endure in Nazi Germany, only this time it is the Afghan women who are being oppressed.<br /><br />But through it all you see the indomitable spirits of these women.  They find a way to survive the most incredible challenges.  They love, they hope, they plan for the future.  They try to create normalcy for their children.  They shake their heads at the men riding by in the backs of trucks with their rifles and airs of self-importance.  They even stay optimistic that their lot in life will eventually change.<br /><br />This book in amazing, just as I expected it to be after my previous experience with Hosseini's The Kite Runner.  Despite the subject matter, it is extremely fast reading.  I learned and understand more about the plight of the Afghan people from A Thousand Splendid Suns than anything I've seen or heard from the media.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not the only one who watches those news stories about the Middle East with a sense of mild apathy.  After all, those countries are always fighting amongst themselves and with others.  There are so many names of leaders, cities, warlords, and factions we don't understand.  I know my sympathy has diluted over the years because all of these problems seem to melt together until one isn't distinguishable from the other.<br /><br />What I most appreciated about this book is that the reader gets an inside perspective of what life was like before, during, and after the Taliban took over the main cities of Afghanistan.  You see how lives change.  I, personally, felt thankful for having been born in the USA (which, considering what a mess our government is in, is something I haven't done in a long time.)<br /><br />Give yourself the gift of an amazing read that will leave you with knowledge of a forgotten group of people--the women of Afghanistan--and a heightened sense of compassion for everyone.

0515141429|5.0|We walk with Reacher down a new road.  No baggage.  No hassles.  Striding out happily with the big man, who yearns only to be invisible, craves solitude, anonymity, a loner who can fit his possessions into a zip loc bag.<br /><br />This is the first Lee Child novel, and having read virtually all the Jack Reacher thrillers, I revisited this road again, thinking I would reread the book that turned me on, that excited me to start with, The Killing Floor.<br /><br />Lee Child weaves action, suspense, mystery, raw power and a killer plot into his debut novel.  Still on the Amazon best seller list, which begins as Reacher, a drifter, six months out of an elite military police unit, gets off the bus in Margrave, Georgia with only a vague plan, a whimsical pilgrimage to discover the roots of a long dead guitar player named Blind Blake.  He finds an old lady who sang with him.  And a whole lot more he didn't bargain for.<br /><br />An almost dozen books later, I'm more than acquainted with the man who simply calls himself, Reacher.  This book is the beginning.  Maybe the best in the series, and a good place to start.  Maybe years from now, after reading Reacher a couple dozen times, you will reread this first novel too, forgetting how good it was that first time.

009917961X|4.0|I have read just about every book by John Grisham and except for \\"The Client\\" and \\"The Chamber\\" I have enjoyed all of them. The main character, Rudy, in The Rainmaker gave me a laugh or too which was nice. The hardships that he encounters throughout the book are real-life experiences that any reader could identify with; bankruptcy, unemployed, homeless, and the list goes on. Overall, this was a fantastic novel and I would recommend it to all readers.
0552998087|3.0|Bill Bryson, a child of the 50s, used to spend each summer with his family on one of those all-American vacations that consisted of endless driving, sweltering heat and the inevitable destination that was, due to his father's preference, free and educational.  He always longed for the chance to buy tacky hats with plastic crap on them and other tasteless souvenirs, and now that he's an adult, he finally gets that chance when he embarks on a nation-wide odyssey in the hopes of getting to know the country he left behind in The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America.    Although he was born in Des Moines, Illinois (\\"Someday had to,\\" he explains on the opening page), Bryson's heart was elsewhere, and he spent most of his adult life living in England.  Some 30 years after those summer journeys he's back in the states, and with no specific itinerary or time constraints, he leisurely passes from town to city, looking for the perfect place that survived from his childhood in this travelogue.    Of course, America has changed since Bryson's childhood days, and instead of finding Perfect Town, U.S.A, he encounters a deluge of faceless shopping malls, unremarkable villages and far too many gas stations.  His hilarious observations usually come at the expense of the people he talks to and places he visits, which almost seems to suggest an air of British snootiness that he picked up from his years living abroad.  Still, there are plenty of irreverent comments (\\"I only ever knew one journalist with a truly tidy desk, and he was eventually arrested for molesting small boys.  Make of that what you will; but just bear it in mind that next time somebody with a tidy desk invites you camping\\") that are just so outlandishly amusing, that it's easy to forgive him for his treatment of the occasional small town citizen.    Traveling across America and being disgusted with the over-commercialization is hardly groundbreaking material.  John Steinbeck, the quintessential American, didexactly that in 1962 with Travels with Charley: In Search of America.  While Steinbeck is a folksy, talkative guy, Bryson instead bares his teeth.  He travels alone and all along the way he doesn't strike up many conversations aside from brief chats with a plethora of waitresses and moronic country folk.  He does meet up with a friend, and later a niece, but they're pushed into the background and the surroundings become the main characters.  The closest we get to travel companions is when Bryson vividly describes what the past trips with his family were like.  His mom says nothing other than \\"Would you like a sandwich, honey?\\" and \\"I don't know, dear.\\"    Much of Bryson's journey on both coasts, and everything in between, brings up plenty woeful places, yet he does find some attractions worthy of his admiration.  A rare few of the stops on his trip nostalgically remind him of his youth, from the sheer scope of the Grand Canyon (\\"Your mind, unable to deal with anything on this scare, just shuts down and for many long moments you are a human vacuum\\") and the \\"sleepy\\" college town of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania (\\"You feel at first as if you should be wearing slippers and a bathrobe\\").  Bryson covers so much ground (38 states) and visits so many similar towns, that at times, his travelogue almost read like a list.  Even the memorable places are often described as simply \\"pleasant,\\" and after a paragraph, it's off to the next destination.  Like the long road trip that Bryson embarks on, The Lost Continent captures the vastness and monotony of driving across America.  Because of the now-famous Bill Bryson humor, for most of it works well and there are plenty of laughs, The Lost Continent becomes more than another lackluster expressway town.
B00005JO5L|5.0|I have it on VHS and have been waiting for the DVD for years. The cop in the movie with the black hair taking the two drag queens into his police car was my neighbor. He fell and hit his head and bled to death in real life. He lived across the hallway from me when I lived in NY. This is a must-see movie for the younger gay audience to see how packed the village used to be and how it looked. The hotel room they set up is over a bar that was called the Anvil. I found the movie quite good as far as realistic bars and scenes. For us a bit older it's nice to see how the good old days were. The murder scene is horrific.

Now he heads a team of fresh young lawyers who also represent the state to help him win cases against Los Angeles criminal underground and others who try to get away with it. While doing this job, STark tries to be a better father and reconnects with his daughter especially when she gives him more trouble than he thought    This is a show about a man finding redemption within the one job he's great at especially since half of L.A. hates for being who he was.  Great script writing and great story telling especially with the one of the most hated professions in the U.S.

0823013626|5.0|Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]    Yes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.    It has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.    Donna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.    Donna splits the book into seven different sections:        * Polymer Clay Basics      * Mica Shift Techniques      * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay      * Creating Texture      * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders      * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays      * Sculpture and Mold Making    I love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.    The twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.    Peppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my \\"Donnelly's Sampler\\" is included in the book.    This is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.
B000001G53|5.0|This was the first Parsifal I ever heard. Of course, it was perfect then, like a sermon. The beauty of the playing-there was no other way to do it. Well, some 17 recordings later, this has moved down about six places on my list, though I still listen to it time to time(about once a month). The problem is, beauty isnt what this opera is entirely about.  Acts I and III are wonderful, but act II seems to be fighting itself-beauty or angst.  Personally, I feel KNA62 is the finest musical interpretation, along with Kubeliks, while the KNA54 is the finest vocally. Moll is good hear as Gurnemanz, not as good as with Kubelik but worlds better than for Levine on the CD and DVD. Van Dam is a good Amfortas, again very beautiful, but where is the suffering of London or Hotter. Peter Hofmann is  astrained, though decen Parsifal, again no where near Siegfried Jerusalem(for Barenboim only!), or Vickers, or Vinay, or Thomas, or even King. Kundry here is uninspired, as if she never mentally made it back from arabia.<br />Its funny how things change over time. Despite all that said above, this isnt all bad. The orchestra places wonderfully and karajan is still karajan, which could be more of a problem than we know. Get the KNA62, or if you dont want that find the Kubelik(its on amazon, before gets imprissoned in the ivory tower in the desert, again, never to be heard from again. Also, get Barenboims, before this one, and Solti.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Because there's not.<br /><br />I love this movie more than I can say. Where to begin. Okay, Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male supermodel and recipient of the Male Model of the Year Award for three years in a row. The movie begins with Derek being profiled by a TIME magazine reporter the same night that he's going up for his fourth nomination against newbie Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. Now, that Hansel, he's SO hot right now, but Derek is a household name. Who takes home the honors? The newbie. Of course. Then, to top things off, Derek's best friends and roommates die in a freak gasoline fight accident. Crushed and depressed, Derek decides to leave the world of male modeling and go back to his roots. But how long will that last?<br /><br />Beginning with the MTV awards right down to the final runway walk, this movie is hilarious! First of all, it's so full of celebrity cameos you can't blink or you might miss one. This includes the outrageous (and fantastic) cameo and a half put in by David Bowie. If you wonder why it's a cameo and a half, you'll have to watch to find out. Secondly, I have never seen a satire so completely willing to go anywhere and take any risk while completely making fun of itself at the same time. I mean, Ferrari, Le Tigre, Blue Steel... what more could you want in a male model? I thank TBS for reintroducing this movie into my life, and Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell for being so hilarious. When you're in the mood for a laugh, Zoolander will never steer you wrong.
0783235380|3.0|I'll spare the plot summary since there are already 72 reviews as of this writing so I'll write on the jist of the movie. Remove all the unrealistic scenes and this movie is basically a good conversation piece for you and your lover (wife, girlfriend, whatever) because it has to do with choices in relationships. Yes, the movie will reflect the basic sentiment prevalent nowadays regarding marriage which is basically that a successful one is a crap shot. But for those who have been run over by that train before we all know that relationships are work.     So jumping from partner to partner when things don't go the way you thought or want them too and you decide that you're \\"not happy\\" just doesn't really work for the average person. All you end up doing is carry your emotional baggage to the next relationship as Sarah's character slowly unfolded. Bottom line is that Ben went through a classic infatuation episode but in the end he did the nobler thing.     If you think that marriage is going to be a perpetual dose of dopamine that will leave you elated and euphoric every day of your life then think again. You have to both make it work and keep reminding each other of what brung you together in the first place before the kids, in-laws, and career.    As for the best acting, Sandra Bullock took the prize. I enjoyed seeing her free spirited bohemian side. She basically made Ben look good.     Ironically enough though, this movie was done before the Beniffer drama - remember that? He basically had the \\"forces of nature\\" in the form of paparazzi to help him walk away from that one. Not exactly the same ending as in this movie.
B000RIHBIE|4.0|I like Sum 41, and have bought a few of their albums, including this one. I'm a big fan of pop punk, and these guys are good at it. This album has many catchy songs, shows a lot of diversity, and is well done.    The only reason I didn't give in 5 stars is that a few of the songs sound way to much like Bink 182 to me. This is especially true about the song 'Walking Disaster'. I am also a big Blink 182 fan. Now that they are gone, I am looking for bands that do similar music. So, Sum 41 is a great candidate. But this song, and a few others, are TOO IDENTICAL to Blink 182. Not only is the music of the same type, but the 'musical tricks' used are also exactly like Blink 182 (e.g., having line-ending vocal note drop instead of rise).    There is also some hints of Greenday (track 7), but this is done more like I'm suggesting. It 'hints' at Greenday, its not a 'copy' of Greenday and their style and methodology. I also find hints of an old band called '10 CC' at the end of track 10. Hints and homages are ok, I just have a problem with down right mimicry.    Having said this, 'Walking Disaster' is one of my favorite songs on the album. I just would have preferred if they had done it more in their OWN style (Sum 41 does have their own) instead of trying to BE Blink 182. But, like I said, the album is very good, I will continue to listen to Sum 41 and likely buy their albums, and I DID give it 4 out of 5, which is not shabby! :)
B00005ATQD|5.0|The only reason I can think of that this DVD deserves 3.5 stars is the MPAA's mandate for the inclusion of digital figures to cover up the sex sequences, which can be seen \\"unadulterated\\" in the Region 2 disc (but with different music, as the theatrical/Region 1 DVD's music was found to be offensive to Hindus, I believe).     But otherwise, this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Like the best of Bergman, like Welles' F for Fake, like Fellini's 8 1/2, this movie represents a story that is truly genre-less. How do you classify Eyes Wide Shut? At Kubrick's _worst_, his movies were some of the best out of their given genres. At his best, they are not only the best of the genre, but transcend it altogether (2001, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Stranglove...).    Other reviewers have already noted what is fantastic about this movie. The lightening is some of the best of Kubrick's career. It holds both Nicole Kidman's and Tom Cruise's best performances of their careers. Sydney Pollack is fantastic. And the centerpiece, the orgy sequence, is quintessential Kubrick.    I think that this movie will be reevaluated in the future, and people will finally understand it for what it is. Personally, I think that Eyes Wide Shut is effectively a period piece. It is a period piece about the 1990s and the era of civilization we now find ourselves in, with the sexual freedoms and faults (and diseases) we now have to deal with. How else do you explain the nondescript \\"New York City\\"? How else do you explain the persistent presence of a Christmas tree in _every damn scene_? It underscores the pervasive materialism at the heart of the 80s and 90s, which in turn underscores the kinds of sexuality and sexual inadequacies on display in this movie. It is a period piece about the 90s, it just happens to have been made in 90s as well.    With his final film, Kubrick managed to create a story that is free of any genre, free of baggage, free of any previous assumptions about what a film can do. It is not his best, but it might be his most fulfilling, and it sums up one of the most cynical, but also one of the greatest director's career with a tiny glimmer of modest - but realistic - hope.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I have to say I was quite dissapointed with this product.   I had heard it was \\"reference material\\" for your HD TV display.  Bull.   But before I mention the bad stuff lets start with the good stuff.    The actual content of the disc is amazing, you will see stuff in this program that you have never ever seen in your entire life.   Amazing pictures and direction. The content is a A+    On to the bad stuff.  There must be a lot of people watching this on 720p and 1080i displays, because if you have a HDTV like this there isnt much a problem.  However if you have a sweet 1080p TV, like my 46 inch Samsung watch out!  For some reason when playing in 1080p you get this snowy effect on some dark areas like caves and shadows of mountains.  This is directly from a bad transfer of the disc.  If you watch in a lower resolution, turn off your DNIe setting or watch it in movie setting you dont have this problem however its because you are not getting it in as good as detail as you should.   And when you watch it on such a large display in high resolution, the snowy flashing REALLY stands out in the scenes were the conversion got messed up.  The reason why this is probably only 66 dollars is because they know of the flaw.  Ive heard the American Discovery HD version will fix this.  Probably best to save your money and buy the 100 dollar version when it comes out later this year, but be sure to look for a review to see if they fixed the 1080p fiasco.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|A fellow Beatles fan told me about this disc.  I thought it was just another compilation of previously released material, but it's a whole lot more than that!  It's a joining together of the Beatles songs and musical passages into a unique theatrical-type program which is extremely enjoyable in its concept and also sounds cleaner with better fidelity. I suspect some first generation master tapes were utilized. If you love the Beatles, you'll probably flip over this baby!  If you're not sure if you love the Beatles, this well-produced and conceived CD will convert you completely.  George Martin did a wonderful job and I'll bet it was a labor of love....The Beatles LOVE rules!

JASON has learned about who was the mastermind behind all of his escapades and he wants answers-and to find things from the beginning.  there are alot of flashbacks(some we have seen and some not-help to fill in gaps for the viewer).  all the bad guys are truly bad with a great performance from aging relic actor ALBERT FINNEY who is just great!!.  there is direct continuance from the second film-lagging time alittle.  there are alot of holdovers obviously from the 2nd film and even so-the film moves at a fast clip with no sense of redundancy.  pacing is fresh and relentless.  the only reason I gave this 4.5 stars and not 5 is, in this film while the action is fantastic there seems to be alot of MTV cuts/quick camera movements. while it looks exciting and it is, slow it down and let us watch JASON BOURNE in his hand to hand contact.  robert ludlum has passed on but there are a couple of books I think written by others waiting in the wing.

B00001U0DP|5.0|My entire family adored this charming tragicomedy about life in Italy just before and during World War II.  Director and star Roberto Benigni has created a fairy tale with an edge.  An irrepressible Jewish waiter falls in love with a socialite, winning her away from her Fascist fiance with a mix of humor, coincidence, opportunism and whimsy.  They have a son and find themselves in the midst of a Jewish pogrom that transports them to an unnamed concentration camp.  Father \\"Guido\\" uses the same skill set that he used to win his wife to protect his four-year old son from the brutality that surrounds him, convincing him that the camp is an elaborate holiday and game in which the winner will receive a new tank.<br /><br />Benigni's performance (which won a Best Actor Academy Award--rare for a foreign language film) is a masterwork--manic, touching, hilarious and affecting in about every possible way.  The scene where he translates a German soldier's camp instructions for the benefit of his son is priceless (\\"No lollipops!  Don't even think about asking!\\") His wife Dora is beautiful and bemused in the first act and exists more symbolically, but still powerfully in the second.  The very young actor who plays son Joshua is amazing--portraying the wide-eyed enthusiasm of his father combined with a mistrustful wisdom well beyond his years.<br /><br />Like the recent French film \\"Amelie\\", \\"Beatiful\\" has a whimsical soul.  The concentration camp sometimes seems a little too smooth, a feature that Spielberg films on serious subjects are sometimes accused of.  Still, the Germans were known for the their organization and order, and the story doesn't really need grisly depictions of much of what went on during the Holocaust to make its point.  The production design also fits with the fairy tale feeling of the tale.<br /><br />My wife doesn't much care for foreign films, but said she felt like she'd learned some Italian watching this one.  My daughter doesn't like foreign films or period movies.  Both loved \\"Life is Beautiful.\\"  You will too.d \\"Life is Beautiful.\\"  You will too.
B000RJO578|4.0|From the same crew that brought us the smashing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz gleefully satires the mainstream, tough guy, bug budget, bullet-laden action films that big studios always push out on us.  Simon Pegg stars as supercop Nicholas Angel, whose action filled career in the big city comes to an unexpected end when he is reassigned to a quiet, quaint, and overly boring village.  Or so we think.  Soon enough, people start meeting mysterious, and bloody, demises, and Angel suspects foul play is afoot.  Teaming up with the dim-witted Danny (Nick Frost), Angel soon finds himself over his head to say the least.  Make no mistake that Hot Fuzz is incredibly funny and instantly enjoyable for those who enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and longtime action movie junkies alike.  Director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Pegg clearly have a love for the genre that allows them to have such casual fun, even though the film never feels like the labor of love that Shaun of the Dead did.  Despite that though, Hot Fuzz is a blast (if a bit overlong) and features a bevy of star talent including Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Cranham, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Cate Blanchett.
B00005JPQR|4.0|First of all, The Bourne Uktimatum is an outstanding, exciting film. Fast paced and at times gut-wrenching. It's interesting to note that original director Doug Limon [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)]] had to fight the world to get his pick of Matt Damon to play Bourne. Now, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Although the movie is meant to be the end of the trilogy (Damon has already said he has no interest in playing Bourne again) the ending does leave a small window for a fourth film. So this may not be the final piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />However, I do have an issue with the movie in general. Starting with [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)]] the characters and plot begins to separate itself from the Robert Ludlum books. In both [[ASIN:0553263226 The Bourne Supremacy]] and [[ASIN:0553287737 The Bourne Ultimatum (Bourne Trilogy, Book 3)]] Jason Bourne/David Webb's motivation is based solely on protecting his wife and family. Marie, introduced in the first book & movie is actually a main character of all three books. But in the second film she's killed off within the first 10 minutes. From that moment on the whole dynamics of the plot change. Now, instead of protecting his family, he starts off to enact revenge, then becomes guilt-ridden of the killings he did in the past. I understand that screenwriters & directors take liberties with the plot of the books they film but the characters of these books were so interesting and now, by the third movie, those that are left have become almost one-dimensional.<br /><br />But anyway, enough of the rant. If you do like non-stop action, things blowing up, car chases, and such, then I would recommend this movie highly. It is an exciting end (?) to the franchise.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Yeah, I know I'm going against the grain on this one, but I honestly believe that once this band got back together with their original drummer, they produced something better than anything they've ever accomplished. The first two songs just completely blow you away with the never ending thrashing and heavy riffs, and Tom's classic voice screaming those lyrics couldn't be better for a man his age. It slows down a little bit, but the album is still kicking your butt with next few tracks till it picks up speed again. 'Eyes of the Insane' takes the cake on this album, along with other songs that are favorites of mine such as 'Cult' and 'Jihad'. It's a very modern sounding style of metal which is a plus, too. Not one song on this album is just OK. Every single one of these songs could be a single in it's own right, which means they all rock. From track one to track ten, you're hearing nothing but the best heavy metal out there that Slayer has to offer today, hands down.    On a side note, if you're looking for a band that is similar to Slayer, I recommend Unearth. I saw them in concert with Slayer, and they sure did give Slayer a run for their money.
0451457994|5.0|I first bought this book at a local bookstore and read the first six chapters. They talked about how man has evolved from apes trying to defend their land to the wise humans that we are today. I then put the book down, thinking that I was not going to read the rest of it. However the next day, I read the next few chapters and then could not stop reading it. I read all day for the next couple of days and finished the book in under a week. The book is very easy to understand and follow.       You should read the book before you see the movie. The book however, is a lot different from the movie. For example, the HAL 9000 computer does not deny Dave entrence to the ship as he does in the movie. Instead, he lets him in and then tries to kill him by cutting off the ship's air supply. To me, the book is better then the movie.      If you like science fiction stories, then this book is a must. It is by far one of the best books that I have ever read
B000I2J0W4|5.0|I personally wouldn't re buy every film that comes out on Hd-dvd especially seeing as how the prices haven't really come down.  That said a film like this is an exception, I believe horror fans are some of the most die hard film fans out there, and should and will pick this one up.    For Audiophiles there is a new 5.1 track as opposed to the mono you got on the previous release.  The beginning score when Jack is driving to the Overlook hotel is amazing cranked up with a Dolby digital plus track in 5.1.  The transfer on this is beautiful.  The Shining is the greatest Stephen King film adapation and is one, if not the greatest of all horror films.  Also one of the greatest films for any genre and right in time for Halloween you can't go wrong.      Special features    - Audio commentary by Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown and Kubrick biographer John Baxter  - The Making of The Shining, with optional commentary by Vivian Kubrick (from the previous DVD)  - New View from The Overlook: Crafting The Shining featurette  - New The Visions of Stanley Kubrick featurette  - New Wendy Carlos, Composer featurette  -Theatrical Trailer - This was one of the most effectives and eeriest trailers I've ever seen and it was so simple.    I'll go more in depth of the special features as I watch them.    Technical Specs:  - Aspect Ratio: 1080p HD 16X9 1:85:1  - Audio: Dolby true HD:  English 5.1 Dolby digital plus
B000068PQ0|5.0|I've been a listener to the flaming lips for several years, and it seems with each consecutive album they exceed all hopes and boundaries. At least all my hopes and boundaries.  Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is a very deep but gentle album (admittedly it sometimes is rather aggressive) that captures your mind and won't let it go until it's through.  As a matter of fact, this album is so damn near perfect i don't even feel worthy to review it.  The guitars soar, the drums roar, the sound effects make you wonder whether its men or gods in that studio.  But above all that, what i like about this album more than anything is that every song has a brilliant melody.  It's like a breath of fresh air.  It seems that melody has been all but rejected by modern society.  Granted, some of these hip-hop stars can throw one off every now and then, but to even compare them to the flaming lips is a sin.      All in all, this album is amazing and easily worth the price of admission.
B00008972S|5.0|It is great. I bought it as a gift because of the extra info and it is well worth the extra investment the info is awsome so is the many story. A winner
0307383415|5.0|Well written depiction of how Barack Obama came to be a man with much focus on his paternal side of the family. I would like to read a follow up book with more focus on his mother's influences on him.
630522577X|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. They did a good job with it two. The extra stuff stinks  so buy it for the movie.
B000002IZ4|5.0|this is a great follow up to core.  stand outs are meatplow, big empty, vasoline and my favorite; interstate love song.  all of these are still in heavy rotation on the radio.  after song #11 ends DONT TURN OFF THE RADIO JUST YET!  keep it playing and another song starts playing, gracious melodies.  its more comical than serious.  the guy has a real cheesy sounding voice.  actually sounds like he is some sort of vegas lounge singer.  if you like this band get this, core and thank you (a greatest hits compilation) and thats about all you should need.  also check out velvet revolver if you like scott weiland him and slash put something together after STP broke up.
B000065V3H|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!! It takes me back to the good old days... curled up on Grandma's couch with my cousins, huddled around the tv with a bowl of popcorn!! Too much fun! We would watch it over and over!<br /><br />It is such a cute story. I think teenage girls will love it still! After all, it does have a younger, but still cute, \\"Dr. McDreamy\\"!!!
1878424505|5.0|But SO hard!  What a paradox.  If we all lived our lives this way, we'd communicate better, we'd feel better about ourselves, and our relationships would improve.  What's not to love about that?  The trick - making it a part of our everyday lives.  I hope I can do that!
0316018953|3.0|At a little over 200 pages, this book is more of a novella than a novel.  It moves along well enough.  There's some misdirection as to the who the bad guy is, but it's almost as if thou dost protest too much and ultimately it was very obvious who it was all along.  I figured it out way too early in the story and though I like Bosch and following him around the mean streets of LA, this was a somewhat disappointing entry in the series.
B000002UAO|5.0|Have always liked Rubber Soul.  One of my favorites.  Was in high school when it came out.
B000QXDED6|2.0|The movie is good (6/10), and the visual style bumps it up to 8/10. The direction, the memorable lines, and the comic book style are all perfect. But this DVD is sparse on the extras. The only extra is the director's commentary. It's a great extra but in order to see all the featurettes about the historical battle or behind the scenes you must buy the two-disc version.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I really bought this CD on a whim.....it was on sale.  It is much, much, much more than I expected.  What I expected was crunching, aggressive metal with growling angry voices. Lincoln Park does this on some songs, but does it very well (Given Up and No More Sorrow). The music is creatively organized and the vocals are superior to anything I have heard in the heavy metal genre. Most importantly, the lyrics (which you can easily understand) have meaning in today's world. The \\"protest\\" songs are outstanding (Hands Held High and No More Sorrow) and really have relevance today for every man, woman, and child, not just your typical \\"angry adolescent\\".  For example, the raspy, screaming chant of \\"theives and hypocrites\\" accurately depicts members of our current administration. LP embarrassingly describes G.W. Bush as \\"the leader just talks away stuttering amd mumbling for the nightly news to replay\\".  Although their line \\"when the rich wage war, its the poor who die\\" is not original, I would certainly like to hear it much more often in all kinds of today's songs....rock, pop, country, etc.  I am from the generation that helped to force the Nixon administration end an immoral war and we need EVERYONE to focus the same energy on Bush and friends. As LP says, \\"Your time has come to be replaced.\\"      So, I give Lincoln Park an A+ for taking a \\"clear political stand\\". My only concerns with this CD is its over-reliance on ballads and the fact that it could be longer by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, many of the ballads are excellent with great melodies, harmonies, and themes, but I would have enjoyed a little more of the harder metal.  All and all, it is an excellent effort and a good way for us \\"older rockers\\" to add some contemporary metal to our collections.  Try it...I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|GREAT MOVIE FOR DEPP FANS.  HE IS SO CUTE AND COOL IN THIS JOHN WATERS MOVIE.
0440238609|4.0|I don't read much fantasy or sci-fi anymore but was intrigued when I saw the movie poster recently.  I thought perhaps I could read it with my son but quickly realized the child-snatching plot in the first book is too fearful for kids under 10 or 12.  The second book sets up the great conflict that is resolved in the third, final book.  I enjoyed this trilogy very much.  I did find some of the character dialog a little stiff (for my tastes) and the two protagonists, Lyra and Will, mature beyond belief.  The closing chapters devoted to tying up the loose ends got too maudlin for me.  Overall, though, this was a \\"ripping good\\" yarn.    Many other reviewers have pointed out Pullman's anti-religion basis for this story.  I would also warn off anyone for whom belief in God, original Sin, heaven-and-hell as the Afterlife, etc. is essential to their spirituality.  This story negates all of that.  There is no doubt that the \\"Church\\" antagonist is the Catholic church.  But Pullman also devotes as much to the idea that Love is the greatest power, that Knowledge can be used as much to help people as it is used to keep people in fear and want.   Add to that the themes of heroism and sacrifice and I have to say that there is much more to these books than being \\"anti-religion\\".
B000NA2348|5.0|\\"Young Americans\\" still surprises me to this day with it's amazing R&B.  The sound was more clearly mixed than \\"Diamond Dogs\\" and it was a real departure for Bowie.  The regular remastered CD with, \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\", \\"Who Can I Be Now?\\" and \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\" sounds even better than the original CD.  The extra three tracks are on par with the other songs and its bewildering that in an era when 12 songs per album were standard, Bowie released an eight song album.  \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\" is a much more improved R&B version than the rock version.<br /><br />The 5.1 mix surprised me.  It is not perfect and I like it that way.  Luther Vandross's back-up vocals come mostly from the rear speakers and you can hear him much more clearly.  The congas on \\"Young Americans\\" are a little loud for the mix, but it makes the whole experience seem more like a live studio recording instead of a carefully remastered remix.  In fact, Bowie mentioned in the liner notes that he liked recording this album with all the instruments playing at once while he sang.  There are other surprises.  On this DVD you can hear John Lennon speak briefly after one song and the finale of \\"Fame\\" has each word of 'fame' descending going around the room from speaker to speaker, but the loud shout of 'fame!' before, 'what's your name, what's your name, what's your name...' is missing.  It catches you!<br /><br />The Dick Cavett interview is a treat, with Bowie sniffing and wiping his nose while fidgeting with his cane.  So he did a lot of coke during this period.  Who cares?  The album is a perfect choice for surround sound.  And that sound will vary from system to system.
B000003N7K|5.0|This record reminds me of my honeymoon on the Florida panhandle before anybody went there a long time ago.  It is a sleepy, dreamy, breezy, intoxicating recording that I don't think I could ever live without. It's like a lovely summer afternoon laying in a hammock, in the softest breeze imaginable. Thank you gentlemen.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|AFTER THE WEDDING  (EFTER BRYLLUPPET)  (A+)    I was just coming off my euphoric high from \\"The Lives of Others,\\" a Cold War era story of self-discovery and redemption in the desperately paranoiac last years of the East German Stasi, when along comes an exquisite Danish film about reconnecting lives, second chances, and noble deeds called \\"After the Wedding,\\" written and directed by Susanne Bier, that all but left me hyperventilating.  Both films are as freehanded and frank as they are forgiving while penetrating with astute precision the flawed, enigmatic, but  accessible souls that populate their narratives.  Both explore the murky issues of power, trust, self-interest, honor, morality, and spirituality.  Without sentimentality or the manipulation of our responses, both end on an upbeat, if uncertain note of hopefulness.    \\"After the Wedding\\" is often extraordinary for what is left unsaid -- Bier, with 20-20 vision of her story and its implications, believes in an economy of words and the generous use of camera close-ups to capture nuances in expression, gesture, mannerism, and body language, as her characters have stirring encounters with one another.  Of course, that approach takes for granted the keen insights and instincts of her actors and how fully invested  they are in their roles.  Those assumptions are never in doubt with the cast of \\"After the Wedding,\\" which is headed by Mads Mikkelsen as Jacob Petersen, a rugged, hands-on humanitarian and, in some cases, surrogate father, who administers a food-aid program for orphaned children in India.    The promise of a windfall gift from a wealthy Copenhagen industrialist named Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) that will underwrite construction of an orphanage takes Jacob back to his native soil for somewhat delicate negotiations.  There are terms and conditions to iron out before the transfer of funds can be implemented, so Jacob is obliged to be obliging to his benefactor for a few days.  As it happens, the wedding of Jorgen's only daughter Anna coincides with Jacob's stay, and the affable billionaire is graciously adamant that Jacob attend, though our hero is clearly more at home with grit than glitz.    Just after the ceremony itself, Jacob encounters a coincidental and shocking link with his past and, later, a stunning revelation about the present, that saddles him with a potentially life-altering dilemma.  What follows is an urgent and deeply affecting melodrama, in its most distinguished form, that explores with brilliant clarity and aching humanity the yin and yang of allegiances, moral ambiguities, and, in the end, a decision that tests the mettle of a man torn between two callings.    Mikkelsen, seen for the first time by most American moviegoers as the villain Le Chiffre in last year's James Bond prequel, \\"Casino Royale,\\"  is a magnetic actor,  in the mold of Clive Owen, Gerard Butler, Christian Bale, and Russell Crowe,  who commands the screen with his ideally constructed frame, chiseled cheekbones, and wide eyes that peer icily and inscrutably, probe menacingly, and well up tenderheartedly as befits a complex character haunted by a less-than-impeccable past  and confronted with having to make intelligent judgments and agonizing choices that will change the entire landscape of his future.    But \\"After the Wedding\\" is almost as much Lassgard's film, as he transitions from impregnable corporate mogul with appearances of ulterior magnanimity to gentle giant in the ultimate state of vulnerability.  He has a scene near the end of \\"After the Wedding\\" that's as exhaustively heart-rending as any I've seen on film.    Like \\"The Lives of Others,\\"  \\"After the Wedding\\" was an entry in last year's Oscar sweepstakes for Best Foreign Language Film, but wasn't placed in general U.S. release until the first quarter of 2007.  They'll be tough competition for the wave of late year entries that usually dominate my \\"Dazzling Dozen.\\"
0061142026|5.0|This book is fascinating. At times it is somewhat predictable, but only because it employs many of the familiar archetypes of the Western/European fairy tale tradition; however, it most usually does so with an intriguing and inventive twist. What you *know* is going to happen either doesn't...or does BUT in a different and eye-opening way.<br /><br />I believe that the childhood stories of any culture reflect the norms and zeitgeist of that culture at that time, and that how these change can be traced through how the stories evolve. Witness the Brothers Grimm transformation to Disney, for example. No shoes full of blood in our modern Cinderella or our modern acknowledgement of how life either *is* or *ought* to be (even though this defies reality for some). If I knew more on the subject, it would be fascinating to see what Stardust says about who \\"we\\" are now in relation to the canonized tradition.<br /><br />Further, Stardust strikes an enjoyable and \\"believeable\\" transition in tone between the mythic and the mundane. For perspective, I found \\"The Finovar Tapestry\\" lacking in this regard--it wavered jarringly between something like \\"The Silmarillion\\" and Tad Williams or Charles De Lint at their least inspired.<br /><br />In spite--or perhaps because--of this, Stardust is *not* a children's story. Kids are accustomed to the bad guys dying, so that's probably no big deal, but there are 2-3 scenes that are not appropriate for young audiences due to either graphic sex or profanity. However, once you've read it, you could likely get away with an only mildly edited out-loud read to your kids; it's by no means pervasive.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|IMHO this is the best Wilco album yet. It grabbed me from the first track and just kept getting better. Different from the rest, well maybe but then again each successive album seems to go in a new direction that compliments the previous work but doesn't perpetuate it...isn't that how it should be? As I am concerned Jeff Tweedy is one of the great poets of the 21st century: Great job!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is an awesome cd.  When I first got it, I didn't understand everything Damian was saying, but now that I have it memorized I can truely say this is Damian's best offering to date.  Let it grow on you and read the lyrics along with the song if you don't get it at first.  This is great dancehall style reggae music, produced by his genius half-brother Stephen Marley.  The best songs are \\"Confrontation,\\" \\"There For You,\\" \\"Welcome To Jamrock,\\" \\"The Master Has Come Back\\" (using a Bunny Wailer sample), \\"All Night (f/ Stephen Marley),\\" \\"Pimpa's Paradise (f/ Stephen Marley and Black Thought of the Roots)\\" (probably the best Bob cover by one of his kids to date; completely original), \\"Move!\\" (a re-make of Bob's \\"Exodus\\"), \\"Road to Zion (f/ Nas),\\" and \\"Khaki Suit (f/ Bounty Killer and Eek-A-Mouse).\\"  Damian deserves much respect for this album.  Get it if you love dancehall or if you've heard \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\" (the single) and are just wanting to know if the other tracks live up to its greatness.  Trust me, they do.
B00005JPLW|5.0|i agree with the last reviewer, this movie has lots of slow-motion, so much i wonder why SLOWPOKE RODRIGUEZ isn't in it!!!... also THE MONSTERS!!!!! did anyone noticed abobo from double dragon, yeah the fat dude that looked like a crab,i mean whats up with those arms?????I think  the fat dude was the chef from the persian army, i really dont know what he was doing chopping heads off, he should have been in the kitchen...also,,why were the inmortals zombielike creatures???? this is supposed to be a fansaty-graphic piece of art,,i know that, but should have toned down a little bit, and last but not least my favorite moster of all time..........along with xerses whos my second favorite monster, theres a dude that measures like about 30 feet carrying a little puny persian in his back...( seen on the deleted scenes) WHAT IS UP WITH THAT???? i was insulted, i almost choke on my popcorn when i saw that!!...the persian was just shooting arrows, he looked so hilarious,,i defifnitely gave it first place in this monster mash.......another thing,,leonidas was screaming all the time, samuel jackson should have taken that roll.....great movie to laugh on and have a good time.....
0670827592|5.0|My children (ages 12, 8 and 5) had gotten this book from the library, but since they continued to read it over and over again, I thought we should have our own copy.  It is a very clever story of the Three Little Pigs told from the wolf's point of view.  As enjoyable it is for the children, it's just as enjoyable for the adult reading with them.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I saw 'Serenity' first. I'd never seen the series 'Firefly' and neither had the friend who had gotten a bootleg copy of the Serenity dvd. We sat down and watched it and were immediately sucked in. We didn't know the characters, we didn't identify with them as deeply as those who had seen the series first. But it didn't matter. The action, the well-written quips, the fear that after that first death no one was safe, kept our attention for a solid 2 hours.     As soon as it ended, we both immediately went out and bought a copy. Then we looked everywhere for the box set - it was sold out. Everywhere. It was maddening to try and get a copy of it. In Los Angeles of all places. That shows just how popular this series was/has become.    The series is FAR better than the movie in that it had a 14 hour span to tell a story. Each character has their time in the spotlight and in each episode we learn more about them. They're flawed, they're not perfect, but that's what makes them 'real'.    The movie was an excellent continuation of a story that was prematurely cut by executives that just didn't undestand Joss Whedon's vision - or didn't feel it was profitable enough.    Of course, in a film, there isn't as much time for character moments, but they're there. And if enough people purhase this special edition, Joss said at a recent interview at Comic Con 2007, that the possibility for a sequel rests on sales of this dvd.    If you liked it the first time, you'll like it again with all the nifty new additions. I've pre-ordered my copy. Have you?
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Return to Oz fills that foid where the original Wizard of Oz left off, and allows it's fans to be encompassed within the magical world along with Dororthy, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump... An exciting experience for all ages!
6305971935|2.0|It had an interesting story line, but just didn't deliver on film. I felt I was watching a first effort on the acting and filming and special effects.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This is a movie that my family loved so much that we had to get the soundtrack. We all know the words to the sounds. The two year old hums while the  seven year old and Mom and Dad sign. Great stuff.
0800141849|5.0|I don't care what some of the other reviews on here say, this was a great film filled with joy and laughter.  It was genuine, sort of honest and had all sorts of heart.  It is, by all definitions, a chick flick - and a damn good one!
B00005JPQR|5.0|I just got back from seeing The Bourne Ultimatum at the theater. I have been looking forward to seeing it since it was first announced that it was in preproduction.  I have been a fan of the Bourne series since seeing The Bourne Supremacy (yeah, I saw the second one first and loved it so much I bought The Bourne Identity on DVD the same night after seeing The Bourne Supremacy). The Bourne Ultimatum was an incredible experience.  This movie has moved to the top of my list of favorite movies. It seems that most of the time by the time the third movie in a series comes out, the ideas have run dry.  This is NOT the case here. It far exceeded my every expectation.  I can hardly wait for the DVD release.  I definitely will be seeing this one in the theater, again...and again...and again!
B00008A7QK|5.0|This is a great cd for anyone who is a fan of Marc Bolan!  The collection of songs just rocks my socks. Plus the acoustic version of, \\"Planet Queen\\" is just swingin' cats.
B0000CDJPQ|2.0|I need an adaptor to plug a 800 cable into a 400 plug. I got just the opposite. Okay, i have enouh cables, I can switch configuration.

Found out that the end of the sonnet cable has a flare to it that prevents two cords from being plugged into together.

1594489505|5.0|This is a very good novel - gripping material, terrific writing!  Like Kite Runner, it's un-put-down-able.  But compared with that previous volume, there is much more \\"dark matter\\" explored.  I'm glad to be a woman in the USA rather than in Afghanistan!  Everyday life there is much more difficult and limiting, and cruelty can be a normal life experience. Even though this writer has lived in the US since an early age, he makes it all ring true.  I felt like he was presenting actual facts, not just dropping in gratuitous misery like some best-selling novelists do.  It's well worth learning that my own problems are pretty paltry, but it's sad to think that women are living like this right now.  This is definitely a book to be read and remembered, but don't mistake it for a light read for the beach.  (P.S. - This man has such insight into human suffering, it's wonderful he's now the US envoy to a UN program for refugees.)
1594481717|5.0|Dan Pink's book A Whole New Mind is a resource that is beyond measure.  I can't think of a more nutritious book for parents, teachers, artists, writers, administrators, business people, or anyone who wants to get ahead in life and prosper.      The layout of the book makes it work in a way that each chapter gets you thinking about how to improve upon six fundamental human abilities (like empathy and story and meaning) and then Pink follows each chapter with pages that are colored grey.  These grey pages offer suggestions about how to go about and take action on improving these abilities.  For example, after the chapter on \\"story\\" he suggests a seminar on screenwriting.  I went ahead and took Robert McKee's course on story and screenplay writing in San Francisco.  Outstanding stuff.  These grey pages are so valuable; they make Pink's book a lifetime resource.      As an educational consultant, I promote A Whole New Mind to teachers across the country as a resource for living and teaching writers and influencing young people.     Buy two.  Keep one for yourself and pay it forward to a friend or colleague.   I have given several copies as gifts.  It IS the best book I have ever read.
0393327655|3.0|The combination of poor organization and long sentences using advanced vocabulary words made this book difficult to enjoy. I also think Harris comes through as arrogant and condescending. His discussions would be much more welcome if he would refrain from cheap shots at the oppositon.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|I enjoy the album, but feel guilty every time I listen to it and recognize yet another great Classic Rock band this album \\"borrows\\" from. Its almost become a game.     I checked out reviews tonight to see what other bands people have identified that I missed. One that I didn't see mentioned so far is The Doors. Wolfmother's White Unicorn rips a huge chunk right out of Riders on the Storm.     Its a fun album but lacks creativity. Perhaps they will grow in time.
B00005JMAH|4.0|This is a much darker version than the previous two movies. Director Alfonso Cuaron creates a movie that is permeated with a menacing air, and with creatures such as soul-sucking Dementors about, this is quite natural. The bright, bold hues of the previous two movies gives way to misty dark hues that seems depressing at times, yet is very crucial to the story as the plot does get darker, as does the series progressively.<br /><br />The trio of Harry [Daniel Radcliffe], Ron [Rupert Grint], and Hermione [Emma Watson] have definitely matured as actors and seem more confident in their respective roles. We have Michael Gambon as Dumbledore here [since actor Richard Harris died], and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is played convincingly by David Thewlis [though at times I felt that his character in the book seemed more commanding than on screen]. Emma Thompson plays the Divination teacher, Sybil Trelawney, and I felt that though she is a good actress, her character in the book was much darker and meaner. On screen she seems more of an airhead than anything else.<br /><br />The reason I gave the third movie instalment of Harry Potter 4 stars instead of five is because I read the book, and felt that some crucial plot points that explains a lot had been sacrificed in order to keep the movie to a manageable length. I understand this, especially so since the books in the series do get much longer in length, but I felt that at least some of the important plot points should have been included...for example, there is no real explanation as to the dynamics of the four friends - Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prongs, or the significance of the stag patronus that Harry conjures[ his father was Prongs, as he could tranfigure into a stag]...there should have been a short scene at least about why the three friends minus Lupin decided to become Animagi [tranfigure into animals].<br /><br />Oh well, I guess its too much to ask that all crucial plot points be included in the movie version. On the whole though, this is really a pretty good adaptation with credible acting, and wonderful CGI effects [the dementors, the hippogriff Buckbeak, the conjuring of the patronus etc]. And the scene where the Time Turner is used [where Harry & Hermione go back in time] is pure genius.he whole though, this is really a pretty good adaptation with credible acting, and wonderful CGI effects [the dementors, the hippogriff Buckbeak, the conjuring of the patronus etc].

B0001FR3IG|3.0|This movie had the potential to be much better.  I wish they had included more scenes of the husband and what he was about. All that really stands out to me is all the screaming and running Halle did.  She's a great actress and was great in this movie but I wish she would choose to make movies with a little more substance.  This wasn't her worst. Cat Woman holds that honor, but this was certainly not her best.
B000RJO578|2.0|Seriously, the hype over this film on DVD is unreal.  I was not that impressed with the previews but I decided to check it out anyways.  I usually laugh pretty much at everything and anything and I thought maybe the comical approach this film had would be to my liking.<br /><br />Other than a few funny general spoof plays on London police procedure, this thing is a waste of time.  I just did not see any value to it whatsoever.  Am I being a stick in the mud?  Perhaps I missed something, but considering I have loved films that range from comical to crime drama, this one is at the bottom.  What it does is TRY to be funny, and nothing could be more revolting.
0684857219|5.0|Seeing as how this guy was the best, there is no other way than to get the best advice of the weightlifting sport from the very best. So much is packed in this encyclopedia I sit for hours reading, with a ton of pictures to demonstrate and inspire. If you weight lift seriously, then it is a must have.
B00064WSN2|5.0|Great album that grows on you.  I'm talking milestone.  It stands by itself as remarkable; at the same time it delivers a kind of enhanced echo of its predecessor, Crimson King.  Especially, the guitar and drums interplay here between Fripp and Giles is inspirational.  The pieces still sound incredibly edgy and beautifully smooth.  Works every time.

B000RJO58M|5.0|I gave this disc a rent and absolutely loved the film.  Fast-paced, clever, hilarious, and heart-pounding, not only does it successfully parody and pay homage to ridiculous Hollywood blockbuster action films, it outdoes them in almost every way.    The HD-DVD gets very special treatment as it includes a host of extras not found on the standard DVD release.  I haven't had the time to go through them all but I've read they add up to nearly 18 hours.  Video and audio quality are absolutely superb.  I haven't felt this blown away by an audio mix.. well, ever!  I was so incredibly impressed with this HD-DVD release, and look forward to owning it.  Definitely a great value and rewards fans with the equipment to enjoy the film to its fullest!
B00064AM6C|5.0|I am biased. I love these two. I think they are the best ever and I would give my left eye to play guitar like Jack White. I haven't seen them in concert but hope to before I die. This video is raw just like their music but if you love The Stripes like I do , you will love this video. I watch it all the time.
B000L212HC|5.0|I won't spend too much time reviewing the movie, though I will say, I absolutely love this film.  Christopher Nolan is establishing himself as one of the brightest young directors today.  And likewise, Christian Bale turns in another masterful performance, as he continues to rise to well-deserved heights.  And Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as a man gripped by obsession.    The Blu-ray disc provides a stunning visual and audio experience.  This is one of the best-quality transfers I've seen in any High-Def disc.  Extras are at a minimal, just a short 6-part documentary which is ported from the regular DVD edition.  Thankfully this documentary is a nice 1080p transfer and a pleasure to watch.    Though the disc is a bit lacking in extras, it still deserves a solid 5 rating, as the movie itself is captivating and most importantly, very rewatchable.  It takes on new dimensions with each viewing.
B000PMGS8G|2.0|I own the Silver Anniversary Edition from Amazon.co.uk. It's got better features and packaging, and you will pay a lot less for it.     Just make sure you have a region-free dvd player. I actually bought one so I could play the UK versions of dvds they try to price-rape you with here. Look for a Nexxtech or something similiar for around 30 bucks.      Ordered 1984 on dvd for cheap, too.       ***UPDATE*** 8-14-07    Reordered the UK edition, as my origional metal-cased Silver Anniversary edition is now the property of my ex... It's no longer packaged in the same dvd case. While the artwork is the same, the case is now just a silver plastic snapcase. Just wanted to share that with potential collectors.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|When Discovery HD Theater broadcast the Planet Earth series over the course of 5 weeks, my wife and I tuned in religiously every Sunday night to soak in the brilliance of the show.  Much has been said about this show's quality, so I won't go much further.    The Complete Series on HD-DVD gives you all 11 episodes completely uncut.  When rewatching the series, I was amazed at how much Discovery had to cut out of the original program due to time constraints.  It was like watching a completely new episode every time.  And this show is what High-Def is all about.  The HD-DVD completely blows away any overly compressed and lossy broadcast signal could provide.  Being able to soak in the amazing images in full High-Def is incredible.    The only knock is that BBC inextricably decided to deprive the HD versions  of this set of any special features.  You would think that for a series that was touted as pioneering High-Definition filmmaking, they would've given the HD version the special treatment.  But for some reason the extras are exclusive to the DVD version.  This is a pretty big letdown, but I still have to rate the set highly due to the quality of the program itself.
B000RJO578|3.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie, I was very dissapointed. Shaun of the dead is a very funny movie and I was looking forward to the same in this one.  On a scale of 1-10 shaun of dead is an 8 Hot fuzz a 2, I won't be watching it again.
0143038419|5.0|i love this book... it has been more than a chore to put it down at a reasonable hour! if you can actually enjoy someone else's tales through self-discovery, then you should definitely read this book! if you are looking for a book about yourself... write it!
B00004Z400|5.0|For some reason this CD did not want to please me.  I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived damaged.  The packaging was a joke as it was basically like two cardboard sleeves taped together.  I sent off to get another one and the exact same thing, damaged only this time the CD and the case were damaged.  I gave up and bought it from Best Buy instead.<br /><br />Review:  Love this album, a plethora of sonic, ethereal singing and sharp execution that is very clear.  Each song a statement, a poem or a raging inferno because the Deftones know how to be true to themselves, and therefore the fans.  Five stars and as of this writing, my favorite Deftones album to date.
B000OCZD5G|4.0|I have always been a fan of this and the original Mad Max movies. I was pleasently suprised with the quality of the transfer to Blu-ray fo rsuch an old movie. It had it's poor quality moments, but they were far out-weighed by the quality cheesey-ness of the films story. Loved it!
B00005JPQR|4.0|The Bourne Ultimatum has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) trying to find out more about himself as he's on the run once again. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) believes him not to be a threat but Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) believes otherwise. Since she was after Bourne in the past, Noah wants Landy to help track down Bourne anyway. Bourne risks his life to protect a reporter who wrote leaked information about him in the newspaper. Vosen then sets all his sights on Bourne since he thinks he is the one that gave the information out. Whether he did or not he's still a threat to him either way if he gets his memory back.<br /><br />  Anyway that's about all I'll say since I might've said too much already. But all also say that next to the first movie Bourne Ultimatum is the most exciting. Just like the second one also directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93) this movie is fast paced and never stops moving until the very end. Viewers of the 2nd on knocked all quick camera movements and editing but I don't mind it must. It gives the movies more of a gripping feel. His direction hooks you in and doesn't let you go until it's over.<br /><br />  I'd like to see more Bourne movies since there are more books eventhough this is the last one based on the original writer's books \\"I think so anyway\\". Damon is always in top form though so I'd love another movie with him in the part.
0446677450|2.0|I had hoped to actually get some insight from this book - yet it is so unrealistic and vague it doesn't help at all... Of course, owning your own corporation(s) is better then working for someone else... doesn't take rocket science to figure that out.  Yet there is no insight on how this is accomplished.     I'm dismayed that the author considered one father \\"poor\\" when that father obviously cared enough to teach and provide for his children... the writer wouldn't be someone I'd want to emulate or transpire to, sadly.
B000Q6GXW2|1.0|This version does not play in my standard dvd player.  A disclaimer in the box says I should consult my DVD manufacturer to purchase a hardware or software upgrade to play this HD/DVD disc.  This also happened recently when I bought a CD that was advertsied as a new digitally mastered release.  It failed to play in my Bose or car stereo.  Beware the \\"new HighTech\\" come on.
B000094HMU|5.0|The Zeffirelli production was absolutely breathtaking in its detail: lighting, costumes and staging were truly inspiring.

1932907009|5.0|I have read several how-to screenwriting books and each one has yielded some aspect of information.  Granted, none are completely perfect because writing is like life; it is completely subjective.  However, with that said, there is the constant truth that studio execs are looking for screenplays that follow a particular formula and one that works for the pocketbook.  This is just a hard, stone-cold fact of the business.  If you want to be successful in Hollywood you have to work with the system that is in place.  Out of all the books that I have referenced, Blake Snyder's Save The Cat! is the best about showing you how to create a faultless structure for your story to stand on.   This book is a great starting platform for the basics of screenwriting.  I suggest reading as many different screenwriting books as possible to learn different perspectives and then move on to more advanced books that localize on character development and conflict.  All in all, I would say this is the book to start with.
1582701709|1.0|The book is basically a belief system that everything in your life you attracted it to you.  I don't think anyone would doubt the benefits of afirmations and positive thinking and taking responsibity for your own life and actions.  However, pretending that money, material possessions, friends, health etc are going to just magically appear in your life if you visualize it, seems absurd.  I do believe that you get out of life what you make of it.  The book basically says that YOU create all disease or illness.  The book also says your body regenerates itself every few years and your whole body is new, so any sickenss is all in your head. It says also that aging is all in your head and there is no such thing as aging.  So why is it that every single person who has ever lived on the earth will eventually die or have died.  No one asks to be sick.  It is explained that if you talk about you sickness or are around sick people you are summoning sickness to yourself.  There are just so many things in this book that contradict common sense.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  There are lots of claims but very few, insignificant personal examples.  If you are looking for answers to lifes questions or need money, don't expect this to help.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|I got my HD-DVD version of 300.  This is a good warrior movie and gives some historical information which is interesting and is well made and the new web special features are nice, but the movie is certainly not for general family viewing even adults.  Of course it's rated R, but some of the violent scences are just too over the top sometimes even for R rating for entertainment purposes even if they probably did happen back then.
0060557818|5.0|I think the only potentially more interesting trip would be one into Gaiman's mind. This book is truly exercise for the imagination. I almost always skip overblown descriptions in fantasy books, yet here I found myself rereading some scenes to try and better wrap my mind around the vibrant images conjured up. The people, places and personalities that Gaiman invents are at once thought-provoking, mind-expanding and totally believable. The world he describes is so surreal and delightfully irrational that it actually becomes credible. The reader parallels Richard in his descent into the madness that is London Below, but like Richard acquires a taste for this madness such that it is preferable to the artificialities littered throughout real life that Gaiman exposes.<br /><br />This blending and contrasting of settings is to me the most interesting aspect about this book, but everything else is well done too. The protagonist is endearing, the story is cleverly constructed, and the supporting cast is downright compelling. Dark humor and defiance of stereotypes reign, and the heroes and villains all follow the theme of joining the unconventional with the ordinary, the exotic with the familiar.<br /><br />In the end, perhaps the greatest testament to Gaiman's achievement is that by the end of the book it is hardly clear whether the fantastical or the mundane world is the more \\"real\\" of the two.
B0007OCG56|4.0|First off, this is not your regular \\"Adam Sandler\\" Film.  It should not have been marketed that way.  He was the big name to get people into the theater, and he did a good job at his role, but Paz Vega is the true lead in this.  Paz plays a immigrant from mexico who decides to make a better life for her and her daughter by getting hired on as a housekeeper for an eccentric, upper class housewife who is clueless about daily life.  Adam Sandler plays the homeowner husband who just tries to hold life all together, and is just as grounded as Paz's character.  The movie follows the relationship of a housekeeper and the family over about a 6-12 month period, through the eyes of the housekeeper's daugther.  Despite a huge language barrier, bonds are made.  This is not really a comedy at all, but has it's humorous parts.  Good flick to just take in.  You'll either like it, or push it aside.  Worth a spin though, and give it a chance. Good rental.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have many strollers, and all of them were made without a parent/snack tray!!! I LOVE this!

0679809015|4.0|This book is simple and cute. It's a nice size for little hands and sturdy too. The flaps are a bit difficult to open when you first get the book, and I actually tore a few of them. All in all, this is a cute book to introduce animal names and sounds to a young child.
B00004W510|5.0|When the Band recorded this in 1969 the Band had already recorded a masterpiece, Music From Big Pink.  This album takes the Americana concept a step further.  The album is overflowing with music drenched in Americana and rock.  And the lyrics in this album are absolutely amazing.  They are up to par with the master, Bob Dylan.  They are all about people, places and different times.  The album is about the average man.  It is a concept album lyrically and musically.  Following is a song by song review.    1. Across the Great Divide -  9 out of 10.  This song is a great song to start the album.  Very Happy and fun lyrics.    2. Rag Mama Rag - 10 out of 10.  This song is fantastic.  The way the mandolin and the fiddle are used in this song.  This is a great example of the Band not being afraid to use different instruments in a rock song.    3. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - 10 out of 10.  This is one of the best songs on the record.  The drumming and piano parts are powerful and the lyrics on the civil war are some of the best Robbie Robertson ever wrote.    4. When you awake - 9 out of 10.  This song is one of my favorites and I think the guitar really holds this song together.  This song has a great chorus and hook filled verses.    5. Up On Cripple Creek - 10 out of 10.  This is one of the Bands best known songs.  Absolutely awesome chorus and it is a classic.      6.  Whispering Pines - 5 out of 10.  This is the only song on the record that I don't like.  It has no hook and has uninteresting lyrics.    7.  Jeminia Surrender - 10 out of 10.  This song is just a rocker fun lyrics.  Who doesn't like that?    8.  Rockin' Chair - 9 out of 10.  This song has really great lyrics and really cool instrumentation.  When a song this great isn't the best song on the album you know it's a really great album.    9.  Look out Clevland - 10 out of 10. Another really cool rocker.  Robertson's guitar and Danko's bass really hold down this song down.     10. Jawbone - 9 outof 10.  This song has a couple of musical shifts in it.  It is one of the only ones written by Richard Manuel on the whole album.  It is also very cool lyrically.    11. Unfaithful Servant - 9 out of 10.  This slow tune if filled with great lyrics and a really cool horn section.  The guitar part by Robertson is also really great.    12. King Harvest (Has Surely Come) - 10 out of 10.  This song is one of the highlights of the record.  The lyrics are great and the instruments really bring this song together.  The vocals are also great.  This song is a great end to the great album.    This album is one of the great albums of the greatest musical decade ever.  And if you want a treat you should try and find the take of \\"Get Up Jake\\" that the Band recorded for this album.
0552550299|4.0|I almost rated this a 3-star. Bartimaeus is brilliantly refreshing. He is Professor Snape meets Jack Sparrow. It's well worth the read just for him alone. What bogs this book down is the highly irritating magician Nathanial. He is only 12, yet is seemingly as arrogant, intelligent, and cruel as an adult. I think the author forgot his characters age entirely until much towards the end. While Bartimaeus is the brilliant main character of the book, Nathanial is also a main character - and a highly annoying one, at that. He is Harry Potter, only much worse. I've not read the next two books, but already I'm very sick of him. I will most likely read them simply in pursuit of the demon Bartimaeus. Without him, this book would have been worthless.    The plot moves slow and a large chunk is spent reading a 12-year-old rant and whine. Only the demon saves the day, and what's more, he goes completely unrecognized or un-thanked for his duty.     I do highly recommend this book for the character Stroud has created, but be prepared to take the good with the bad.
B00009V7P8|5.0|the music is extremely mature, soulful and intimate! if you like John Meyer, Jack Johnson, or Amos Lee then you'll probably fall in love with this.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I am a boomer who usually sticks to Van Morrison, Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, the Band, Dylan etc.  I had heard a great deal about White Stripes.  I tried this CD, and I really like it.  It is interesting and different in many ways, but each song is good; each song catches your ear.  Some reviewers thought bagpipes or other sounds were a bit of a joke, but I think each song works very well.  (I also liked Radiohead, Hail to the Thief, in the kind of way that you know it is different, but everything is good in its own way.) I would recommend this CD to anyone of any age.
B00005JPSL|3.0|About midway through \\"No Reservations\\", Zoe (Abigail Breslin) turns to her aunt, Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and says...<br /><br />\\"Aunt Kate, you don't have to do that...\\"<br />\\"What?\\"<br />\\"Try so hard.\\"<br /><br />It occurred to me this is an apt analogy for the film itself. Director Scott Hicks (\\"Shine\\", \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\") you don't have to try so hard to make things cute, romantic and adorable. If you have a well-written script with all of the right elements, everything will come together. Don't force it.<br /><br />Kate (Zeta-Jones), the exacting chef at a well-regarded small restaurant in Manhattan, is very uptight and spends all of her time thinking about food, her restaurant and her career. Her sister and her niece (Breslin, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") are on their way for a visit when they get in a car accident. Suddenly, Kate is her niece's guardian and has to deal with a new young girl in her life. Kate's boss (Patricia Clarkson) asks her to take some time off, but she stops by the restaurant to find Nick (Aaron Eckhart), her new sous chef stirring things up in the kitchen; he plays opera, he jokes with the staff, he's a good guy. But Kate suspects he is trying to steal her restaurant. When she returns to work, she begrudgingly puts up with him because he claims he wants to work with, but that doesn't mean she will like it.<br /><br />\\"No Reservations\\" is based on a German film called \\"Mostly Martha\\". It has been sometime since I have seen the original, but I remember enjoying the film. It wasn't earth shattering, but it was an enjoyable experience. \\"No Reservations\\" seems to be a fairly straightforward remake. Both films tell virtually the same story, with some character names and the location changed. But \\"No Reservations\\" seems excessively \\"Hollywood\\", as though they have drained all subtlety out of the story and tried to make it more `understandable' for the broad audience it will receive in this country.<br /><br />\\"No Reservations\\" is not a bad film. Zeta-Jones and Eckhart are both good, and I felt they were able to build some actual chemistry. Breslin is also good as the young lady who finds herself without a mother and has to deal with this. But it is an extremely predictable film.<br /><br />On \\"Ebert and Roeper\\", Roeper and his guest reviewer gave \\"Reservations\\" thumbs up, noting it was a nice film for the summer and seemed to praise the fact they could predict everything that would happen before it happened. Unfortunately, they hit the mark right on the head. This is part of the reason I feel Hicks is trying to hard to get a reaction from his actors and from us. And also why the film is simply mediocre. If you can catch it on cable, you won't turn it off. But take the time to go to a theater or rent it? No way. Not worth it.<br /><br />After Kate returns to the restaurant, she is reluctant to work with Nick, but her boss insists. Kate's sous chef is about to leave to give birth and she needs some help. At one point, they have a blow up and Nick won't stay unless Kate says she needs him. This scene has been done, and done, and overdone in millions of romantic comedies. Of course, the fact she says she `needs him' is a metaphor for the impending romantic complications. What do you think she does?<br /><br />When she becomes resigned to having Nick around, Kate tears the menu in half and gives Nick a portion of it. But he objects, \\"Your portion is larger than mine\\". She half-heartedly brandishes a knife and he sheepishly slinks away.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Kate makes periodic visits to a shrink (Bob Balaban), a practice enforced by her boss because Kate is so highly strung; she confronts customers when they make a complaint. Unfortunately, you realize really early on the shrink will start using cooking terminology to help Kate with the problems in her life. So when he started to talk about how Kate knew \\"the best recipes in life are the ones she creates\\" the film completely lost me. This was the last straw. For your next film, Mr. Hicks, don't try so hard.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is a good actress, but she has had mixed success in her film career. In \\"No Reservations\\" she seems very consistent in her creation of the super controlling, but also super uptight chef. Everything in her life is about her job and her food. When a neighbor, Sean (Bryan F. O'Byrne) asks her out, she makes up a rule about not dating neighbors; she doesn't have the time or the energy to devote to a relationship. Everything is about her food and her career. Then, when Zoe enters her life, Kate realizes she has to take care of her niece and tries to make her feel comfortable, but she doesn't become June Cleaver overnight. It takes some time for her to open up to her niece and for her niece to feel comfortable around her. This is realistic and makes her performance good. After they move in together, Kate naturally tries to get Zoe to eat, but Kate's idea of food and Zoe's idea of food are two different things. The first thing she serves her niece is a whole roasted fish, complete with eyes, and some saut&eacute;ed squash.<br /><br />Later, after Nick (Eckhart) starts working, Kate has no choice but to bring her niece to the restaurant with her. Naturally, Zoe is drawn to Nick and he realizes she is not eating, so he fixes a big bowl of pasta and gets her to eat. When Kate realizes this, she looks at him and mouths \\"Thank you\\". He nods back. This is the beginning of their relationship and it is a little too precious to be realistic.<br /><br />Nick's purpose in the story is to charm the socks off of Kate, something that has apparently happened very rarely. Eckhart does a good job of making this character interesting. He is the complete opposite of Kate; he likes to play music in the kitchen, get the staff motivated, let them have fun. He is serious about food, but when Kate intones, \\"That restaurant is all I have. It's what I am.\\" We know Nick doesn't feel that way. He replies, \\"It's only a small part of you\\".<br /><br />Naturally, because Nick is such a lovable guy, he is also going to charm Zoe's socks off as well. Zoe arranges for Nick to come over and cook on their day off. Zoe has a plan and has only let Nick in on the details. Whole roasted fish again? Not on your life. But Zoe has more plans than simply food. This is a cute idea, but it crosses the line and becomes saccharin sweet.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin does a good job of portraying Zoe's grief. As a young girl, she doesn't know how to deal with the feelings of loss she experiences after her mother dies. She is afraid, lonely and unsure about what will happen. After she moves in with her aunt, she tries to be brave (when Kate leaves her alone for a few hours to go to the restaurant) but ends up barricading herself in her room. As the story progresses, she gradually becomes more and more accepting of her aunt. As with Zeta-Jones, Breslin makes this believable because they never rush into each other's arms for a big hug. There is too much going on for them to become so close, so quickly.<br /><br />As I said \\"No Reservations\\" is not a bad film, it is just so predictable. If you have seen any romantic comedies in the past, you will probably be able to chart out the entire film about ten minutes in.ta-Jones is a good actress, but she has had mixed success in her film career. In \\"No Reservations\\" she seems very consistent in her creation of the super controlling, but also super uptight chef. Everything in her life is about her job and her food. When a neighbor, Sean (Bryan F. O'Byrne) asks her out, she makes up a rule about not dating neighbors; she doesn't have the time or the energy to devote to a relationship. Everything is about her food and her career. Then, when Zoe enters her life, Kate realizes she has to take care of her niece and tries to make her feel comfortable, but she doesn't become June Cleaver overnight. It takes some time for her to open up to her niece and for her niece to feel comfortable around her. This is realistic and makes her performance good. After they move in together, Kate naturally tries to get Zoe to eat, but Kate's idea of food and Zoe's idea of food are two different things. The first thing she serves her niece is a whole roasted fish, complete with eyes, and some sautéed squash.    Later, after Nick (Eckhart) starts working, Kate has no choice but to bring her niece to the restaurant with her. Naturally, Zoe is drawn to Nick and he realizes she is not eating, so he fixes a big bowl of pasta and gets her to eat. When Kate realizes this, she looks at him and mouths \\"Thank you\\". He nods back. This is the beginning of their relationship and it is a little too precious to be realistic.    Nick's purpose in the story is to charm the socks off of Kate, something that has apparently happened very rarely. Eckhart does a good job of making this character interesting. He is the complete opposite of Kate; he likes to play music in the kitchen, get the staff motivated, let them have fun. He is serious about food, but when Kate intones, \\"That restaurant is all I have. It's what I am.\\" We know Nick doesn't feel that way. He replies, \\"It's only a small part of you\\".    Naturally, because Nick is such a lovable guy, he is also going to charmZoe's socks off as well. Zoe arranges for Nick to come over and cook on their day off. Zoe has a plan and has only let Nick in on the details. Whole roasted fish again? Not on your life. But Zoe has more plans than simply food.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is one of the treasures of the Disney catalog.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to see where great Broadway musicals were being written in the 90s should look at this film. The songs by Alan Mencken and Howard Ashman are masterful.<br /><br />The classic story is beautifully realised by directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Beautifully sung and voice-acted by the talented cast. You would have to be hard of heart to not be moved by the finale.<br /><br />Coming after \\"The Little Mermaid\\", the success of this \\"traditional\\" animated film inspired the resurgence of the previously moribund animation genre in the 90s, which has continued through until today.
B00005JODK|4.0|\\"Hairspray\\" is easily one of the most infectious, fun films I have seen in years. I defy even the most hard-hearted musical hater to keep his or her foot from bouncing to the melody of the very enjoyable musical score.<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) wakes up every day excited to go to school because it means she will only have a few hours to go before running home to catch her favorite television show, \\"The Corny Collins Show\\", a local \\"American Bandstand\\" type show, is on. She and her friend, Penny (Amanda Bynes), rush home after school to watch Corny (James Marsden) croon his way through a selection of great songs and introduce the rest of his dancers. Among these teens, all of which go to Tracy's school, are Amber (Brittany Snow), the daughter of the station manager, Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer), a former beauty queen who now will stop at nothing for her daughter to follow in her footsteps. But Tracy only has eyes for Link Larkin (Zac Efron), the good-looking lead crooner and boyfriend of Amber. One day, Tracy hears they will be holding an audition to replace a girl who will be taking nine months off. Her mother, Edna (John Travolta in drag), discourages her because she doesn't want her daughter upset, Tracy is a big girl and girls like her just don't get on television. But her dad, Wilbur (Christopher Waken), owner of the joke shop under their apartment encourages her to go for it and Tracy rushes down to the station. Velma quickly dismisses her. Tracy ends up I detention and meets a bunch of African American students who are trying to pass the time dancing and singing. One of these students, Seaweed (Elijah Kelly) shows Tracy some moves, which she quickly learns. The next day, Corny Collins hosts the hop at their high school and Tracy decides to do the dance she picked up from Seaweed, with his full consent. Corny hires her on the spot and she becomes a popular, regular fixture on his show. Much to Velma's chagrin. Once a month, the Corny Collins Show hosts \\"Negro Day\\" and Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) takes over, bringing in a group of black students to dance. But Tracy doesn't understand why they have to remain segregated and tries to help change things.<br /><br />\\"Hairspray\\" is the latest in a growing sub-genre in Hollywood; the popular film adapted to Broadway musical and then filmed again with the Broadway score. Director Adam Shankman has created a film with such a joyous spirit it is completely infectious. Is this the same director who worked on \\"Cheaper By The Dozen 2\\" and \\"The Pacifier\\"? Has he been holding out on us? It seems impossible the same director made all of these films. \\"Hairspray\\" is really good.<br /><br />The entire cast is enjoyable and adds to the overall feel of the film. But you have to admit watching Christopher Walken play the husband of an overweight John Travolta is worth the price of admission alone. Christopher Walken always appears to be enjoying himself, whether he is doing a good job of creating his character or not, making him one of the actors I always look forward to watching in a film. He has done his share of stinkers, and doesn't always do such a great job of creating an interesting, different character, but he has a good time and this makes him all the more watch able. I have seen the trailer for his next film, \\"Balls of Fury\\", probably a hundred times and it always makes me laugh to see Walken in his Fu Manchu outfit.<br /><br />There is a scene late in the film when Wilbur and Edna dance together in their backyard, fantasizing about different types of dances. In one of these fantasies, they start to dance like Astaire and Rogers. It is simply hilarious to see Travolta, in drag, wearing a fat suit, and dancing like Ginger Rogers, complete with silvery gown, in Walken's Fred Astaire hands.<br /><br />Travolta is also quite good. He takes the role, historically played by the likes of Harvey Fierstein and Bruce Vilanch, and makes it interesting and even a little subtle. Edna has a phobia and has holed up in their family home for years. As the owner of Edna's Continental Laundry, she does laundry all day, a business she tells Tracy she can own. One day. If she is lucky. But Edna's clients come to her, so she never has to leave the house. She makes allusions to the fact this added to her weight gain, but Wilbur also comments that he has always loved her, preferring size 50 women, so I think her size has been a constant throughout her life, and Travolta brings this to the character, making us feel her desperation, her subtle loss of hope even if she won't show it.<br /><br />I was a little surprised by how little singing and dancing Travolta does. He has a nice number with Nikki Blonsky, when Edna's daughter takes her out of the house for the first time. Later, Travolta has the dance number with Walker, and he/ she joins in the big finale \\"You Can't Stop The Beat\\". We have seen Travolta dance on film, this is how he became a star, so I expected more of this. Perhaps it was too difficult, or too out of character to have Edna do much.<br /><br />The real find in the cast is Nikki Blonsky, a newcomer. The young lady is about as far removed from other teen actresses like Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff as you can get. She has a `full figure' and more talent in her pinky than Lohan. Her performance is so exuberant you can't help but smile.<br /><br />The film opens with Tracy singing \\"Good morning Baltimore\\", a love letter to the city where the film is set. At one point, she even serenades the rats eating out of the garbage cans in front of a restaurant and the waves happily at the neighborhood flasher.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see Blonsky, who is anything but thin, playing a character who doesn't even seem to realize she is big. No one at her school ever mentions it, she never seems to care, and in fact embraces it. After she appears on \\"The Corny Collins Show\\", and becomes a local celebrity, Mr. Pinky (Jerry Stiller) calls and wants her to become a spokesperson for his Plus Size dress shop. She doesn't care and we don't care. It is refreshing to see such a thing in a major Hollywood motion picture.<br /><br />And she can dance. She is in the majority of the dance numbers and helps to bring a more modern style of dance to the show, a style she first learned from Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), an African American student, and all of his friends. Tracy gets detention from one of her teachers and she reluctantly walks down the hall. Then, when she enters the detention room, she finds a number of African American students dancing together, trying to help the time pass. She immediately embraces them and they learn to accept her. It is a nice moment because it says something about the era; the detention room is filled with African Americans, and Tracy is the lone Caucasian. It is also a good moment because she doesn't care about the color of their skin than they don't care that she is overweight.<br /><br />In fact, no one seems to care about Tracy's size except for Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former Miss Baltimore Crabs, who now runs one of the few television stations in Baltimore. But Velma dislikes a lot of things, so it is difficult to tell if she really dislikes Tracy's size or dislikes Tracy because she isn't a perfect white girl, like her daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow). Velma dislikes the fact she has to turn over \\"The Corny Collins Show\\" to Motormouth Maybelle once a month; she would prefer to see everything as white as bread. All the time. And Pfeiffer does a good job of making this character interesting and fun to watch. Essentially the villain, Velma is also the broadest of the characters, but Pfeiffer manages to pull the performance back a little and make it les cartoony than you might expect.<br /><br />James Marsden stars as Corny Collins, the host of the \\"American Bandstand\\"-esque show at the center of the film. At first, he seems to be yet another local celebrity whois entirely too full of himself, but as the civil rights themes of the film become more prevalent, he takes an active part in the integration of his own show. Marsden is a very good looking actor and his smile beams when he first appears on camera, perfectly fitting the persona we would imagine for a local celebrity with his own television show.<br /><br />Queen Latifah makes another memorable appearance in a musical. In \\"Hairspray\\", she plays Motormouth Maybelle, the owner of a record store, the mother of Seaweed, and the host of \\"Negro Day\\" on \\"The Corny Collins Show\\". She begrudgingly accepts her role in the universe, until she receives a little push from Velma and some inspiration from Tracy. Then, she becomes a leading force in the civil rights movement in her community.<br /><br />There is another nice moment depicting the era and the changing of the times. On one episode of \\"The Corny Collins Show\\", Amber and two of her backup singers sing a sweet song, using dance moves popular in the 50s. The next day, Motormouth Maybelle features three African American singers singing the same song, but with a lot more feeling and better dance moves. This does not escape Velma's attention.<br /><br />Zac Efron (\\"High School Musical\\") plays Linc Larkin, the lead singer on the show and Tracy's idol. He has a likable charm and soon notices Tracy at their school. Elijah Kelly rounds out the cast of young actors playing Seaweed. Kelly is a dead ringer for a young Sammy Davis Jr. and has a likable energy matching much of the rest of the cast.<br /><br />\\"Hairspray\\" has a lot of fun depicting the era, making fun of the bad (we see two pregnant women in a bar, smoking and drinking) and embracing the good. There is a great moment before the television show starts taping when all of the performers are clouded by hairspray, primping and preening, preparing to go on. Its also fun to watch the taping of \\"The Corny Collins Show\\", something that seems so of the era, yet could easily be done in this day and age. The film has a lot of fun depicting the era, as the styles change from the more safe 50s, slowly morphing into the more loose and freewheeling 60s. All of these moments help to give the already buoyant film even more energy, even more fun, and even more laughs.<br /><br />\\"Hairspray\\" is just a lot of fun.e doesn't care and we don't care.

And that is how Burgess wanted the book to be read.
B00005JP5P|4.0|The incredible style of this movie offers a lot to like. The space hardware brings 2001 to mind: massive and majestic, and with all the drama you could want inherent in near-solar space. Like in a deep-sea submarine, where any trickle of water threatens catastrophe, any glimmer of light getting past Icarus's shields threatens incineration. Sunlight as adversary gives the director's visual sense a range of play that's hard to equal in any other environment. That visual style, plus a narrative sense that omits as much as offers, carries this movie.<br /><br />Note what I've left out of the list above. Icarus's crew remain drab and generic, hard to care about except in a very few scenes. Michelle Yeoh finds herself under-utilized as the gardener (?!), for example. And, in the kill-them-off countdown of crew members at the end, Cassie seems more to wander away than to pass away with any dramatic purpose. The supposedly scary sequence toward the end falls flat, at least to anyone who's seen the tension build in [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien]]and other flicks. And, if you want science in your science fiction, see something else. There's so much wrong with the solar physics here that I don't even know where to start. (Yes I do - the sun has way too much thermal mass for the proposed temperature changes to happen on anywhere near the time-scale of this movie. There's lots more, though.)<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" is one of those movies that gives two contradictory impressions. The visual spectacle carried me away as I sat in front of the silver screen, partly because of the silent violence in every flash of light. Unfortunately for the movie, it ended, leaving me behind with its many flaws.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, rating this mostly on its visual strengths

0618680004|2.0|Richard Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and one of the top thinkers in his field - that being evolutionary biology.  When the topic is science, this book informs.  Unfortunately, the God Delusion is an example of how brilliance in one field does not translate to brilliance in all fields.  This careful scientific thinker abandons the disciplines that have garnered him so much prestige in science and resorts to hyperbole and a strident tone in an attempt to mask fallacious arguments, and flawed logic.  Dawkins, of all people, should have been capable of rising above such sloppy thinking.  In the end, Dawkins' arguments will satisfy atheists who will have their positions reinforced, and perhaps some non-atheist readers will we swayed who are willing to be persuaded in spite of careless arguments, however careful readers who are not atheists (Dawkins' target audience) will find Dawkins' arguments unconvincing.    In the first chapter Dawkins expresses one of his objectives for writing this book; that a believer who starts reading the book will be a non-believer when the book is finished.  He is out to proselytize in the same way that a Christian evangelical would proselytize.  And he employs techniques similar to those employed by Christian fundamentalists.  It seems that I have just read my first apologetic from an evangelical fundamentalist atheist.  Unfortunately, I doubt that Dawkins would be flattered by such a characterization.  If he had really understood his objective, he would have taken considerably more care in assembling his thoughts.  One other point regarding persuasion; ridiculing the beliefs of those you are attempting to persuade will have the opposite affect to what you intend.  One of the fundamental flaws that pervades the book is the question of which god is being critiqued.  In chapter 3 Dawkins takes some time in identifying the god under review.  He suggests that his focus will be the god that is revealed in the three great monotheistic religions that claim divine revelation (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) with primary attention to the Christian god with which Dawkins is most familiar.  This is a creator god who created the universe but who himself is uncreated.  This lays the necessary ground work for addressing the issue.  So far so good.    But then we get to chapter 4 and we have suddenly left that god behind and Dawkins proceeds to dismantle a different god - a straw-man erected for the purposes of easy dismantling.  This new god is one that itself was designed.  The god of Christianity who creates but has no creator is replaced by a god who was designed and presumably has a designer.  In essence the whole basis of Dawkins' argument is new revealed and rests on the question that if god designed the universe, then who designed god.  I wasn't sure at first whether I read that correctly.  But Dawkins returns to this theme a number of times through the remainder of the book - as irrelevant as it is to the god of Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam.  The second part of Dawkins argument is the fact that the only way we know of for complex organisms to exist is through a process of evolution.  So if the universe is so complex that its existence is highly unlikely, then a creator god who designed the universe must be even more complex than the universe he created and therefore even more unlikely to exist - indeed most unlikely to exist.  These statements are absolutely true in and of themselves.  But completely irrelevant to the god I thought Dawkins was critiquing.  So what are we to make of the fact that we've changed gods in mid stream?    I am faced with one of several explanations for this dichotomy.  1.  Dawkins did not realize his misstep.  (Although, a high school student could claim this excuse, but Dawkins is too smart for such a lapse.)  2.  Dawkins realized his misstep but had already formulated his arguments in such a way that he needed a designed god and he hoped most readers would not noticethe bait and switch.  In other words, he had such noble ends that the means were justified.  (Dawkins' is somewhat notorious for his arrogance.  This would reinforce that.)  3.  Dawkins was unable to able to muster the arguments to dismantle an uncreated god and deliberately resorted to a straw-man to dismantle instead.      So, Richard Dawkins, give it another try.  Your assignment is to dismantle the God of the Bible and of the Qu'ran, not a straw-man.  Specifically, a god that created the universe but is itself not created because it has existed with no beginning and no end.  Some further guidelines;  1.  Pointing out how bad religion is does not disprove god.  2.  Pleading that everything must have a first cause including god is pointless since the Bible itself (and the Qu'ran, for that matter) claims that god did not have a first cause..  You objective is to critique what believers believe, not what you think they ought to believe.  3.  Clarify whether your objective is to convert believers, or amuse fellow atheists.  If the former, then resist the urge to insult god-believers.
B000002J0N|3.0|I bought this album on a whim, when something reminded me of this favorite from my senior year of high school.  The lyrics don't do as much for me as they did in 1977, but the smooth harmonies still hold up.  I wouldn't call the album a must-have in the oeuvre of Crosby, Still, Nash, (and Young), but I'm glad to have added another item to my collection of CDs that replace my 70s LPs.  A better investment for those who like this stuff would be the \\"new\\" Neil Young album of his 1971 concert in Massey Hall.  That's priceless.

0743270754|5.0|I brought this book for two reasons.  After reading \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\" by Joseph J. Ellis, which was a phenomenal and touching biography on Washington and  \\"1776\\" by David McCullough, also about Washington, the general - I wanted to find out more about our second greatest president, Abraham Lincoln.  My other reason was I saw others with the book \\"Team of Rivals\\" during my commute to work of which I seldomly ever see anyone reading history books other then myself.    First, I will say this is probably one of the best books I have ever read.  The size (over 700 pages) was intimidating but I will tell you, I could not stop turning the pages.  This was one of those books you read that plays like watching a vivid movie that runs through your mind.  I actually felt as though I lived in the 1850's and 60's and knew Lincoln personally.  When the book was finished, I wish it had not ended - it was that good!  It was moving at many times, deeply touching and really absorbs the reader.      The book is so phenomenal because of its scope.  It tells of what life was like during the mid-century of the 1800's.  It encompasses politics, people, foreign policy, scandal, war, life and death.  I actually believe it's a biography of many of the powerful and gifted men of the times beside Lincoln.  It encompasses the issue of slavery and the ferver it created.  This issue was known even to the founding fathers as an issue that would tear apart our then infant country and thus \\"tabled\\" by Washington and others giving time for our nations' government to form and get underway.  And rightfully so as it did tear the country apart.    You witness William Henry Seward change from a \\"silver spoon\\", aristocratic, life- time politician holding many offices to being out maneuver for the presidential nomination of the under dog - Lincoln.  Seward \\"matures\\" through his career to Secretary of State and Lincoln's closest advisor, friend and confidant.  Lincoln's powerful speeches allhave the hand of Seward behind them.    Salmon Chase gets equal attention throughout the book.  He is portrayed as an almost villain and short sited as he appears to be out for himself, blind of the world's opinion of him and obsessed with becoming president.  For all his shortcomings, he was crucial to Lincoln and served him well in his position.    Edward Bates gets the least attention and by the middle of the book, there are many times he is completely unmentioned.  Very little is said of his accomplishments or importance to Lincoln.    The book brings in many more characters of the time such as McClellan, Grants, Sherman, Lee, Welles, the Blairs, Douglas, Mary Lincoln...  The list goes on.  No stone is unturned.  The reader gets a true, exciting picture of the FULL political climate of the times.      But above all, the author hails Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents of all time.  And she fully backs up her claims with pain staking research and support as to why she feels this way.  The reader will walk away knowing Lincoln was perhaps one the greatest humanitarian leaders who ever lived.  You felt his grief as he witnesses first hand the dead and wounded from the civil war.  You feel his frustration with his failed generals such as Meade, Burnside and McClelland and his loving embrace of Grant and Sherman witch were men \\"who actually fight\\".  The agony was he did not want the war to continue tearing the country apart and the death it brought.  You will feel his love for his family and his life long established friendships.   You will understand how important he was to the South when the war ended as his sympathy and understanding in healing was the best ally to the South.  This was a man who was an actual human being who \\"felt\\" and \\"related' to the common man as he rose from nothing to the highest office in the land.  The sorrowful ending of the book with the assignation of Lincoln filled up my eyes with tears.  Because I knew after reading this volume,that something so great, a man so inspiring was lost to the world.  This was a man who was ingenious with his thought and was honest and convinced in the greatness of an undivided country.  We need another Lincoln now!    I will still endeavor to read a biography specifically for Lincoln as this book didn't focus on specifically him.  I'd also like to read a moving biography on Andrew Jackson - Please leave me a comment if you have any suggestions of good books for these.  Thanks!

Gilbert's journey is interesting and exciting and I found myself wishing that I was on a life-quest journey like her's.  Honestly, I didn't love Elizabeth at first but the more I got to know her the more I grew to like her.  Her book is the journey of a life-time and for that reason alone, it is a must read.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I did a very thorough search of crib mobiles and their capabilities before I bought this one.  I am very pleased with the results of this one.  The mobile itself has 3 volume settings options (no sound, quiet, or louder), several music options in addition to a \\"rainforest\\" sound of birds chirping, owls hooting, and crickets making noise (my favorite setting, as it seems to sooth my 3 month old to sleep quickly), an option to have the night light on or off, and various combination options (i.e., light or no light with sound or no sound).  The rainforest characters are very colorful and, in addition to the leaves going up and down, the orbital movements of the characters makes my daughter very fascinated.  This mobile really started getting the quiet, peaceful attention of my daughter when she was 8 weeks old.  Now at 13 weeks old, the mobile still gets used daily as she transitions off to sleep.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|For years--25 of them--I coveted the top-of-the-line financial calculator from Hewlitt Packard, the 12c. I'm old enough to remember the first HP calculators--4-function devices with red LED displays--when they were introduced while I was in college. They were always the calculator we wanted, but couldn't quite afford.<br /><br />Since then, HP has set the gold (or in this case, Platinum) standard for calculators, and the Platinum Edition 12c does not disappoint. The only difference I can see between this model and the \\"traditional\\" 12c is the color of the metal surrounding the display: \\"platinum\\" (brushed aluminum) instead of gold-colored aluminum.<br /><br />Functionally, the calculator allows both standard and reverse-Polish notation (RPN) for entry. I'd never used RPN before, but I'm a convert--it definitely saves steps, and is easy to learn and remember. The HP-12c has dozens of built-in financial functions, and is also programmable.<br /><br />The supplied manual was written for the HP 12c Platinum, and is straightforward, easy to follow--even the sections on programming. Clear, definitive examples are provided, with step-by-step instructions for solving almost every imaginable financial calculation. There is also a section to explain the differences in calculations between the USA and Great Britain, so you prospective buyers \\"across the pond\\" should have no trouble working with the 12c.<br /><br />The 12c comes with a leather case--nice, but not sure how useful it is. I suppose it might protect the unit if you're carrying it around in your briefcase, but otherwise, you have to remove the calculator from the case in order to use it. However, this is a very minor quibble.<br /><br />In sum, the HP 12c Platinum is the best at what it does, period. You won't be disappointed if you buy this unit.

B000P2A24W|3.0|All I can say is Bon Jovi's sound has traveled far and wide from the way it used to be back in the good old days of Keepin the Faith and These Days....  Jon's voice is nearly an octave lower than it used to be and his accent has changed too.  I much prefer to hear the magnificent vocals found on past albums than the average vocals you'll find on this one...
031286504X|5.0|I just finished to story (not the book) and I have to say that I didn't it except it to be so short. I know if I would have read on a little more I would have found out that its basically a short story, even still, I think that there could have been so much done with it. Don't get me wrong, Mathesons' interpretation and use of scientific fact is flawless and very convincing, but I was just left wanting more. (which is sometimes a good thing.) I also greatly enjoyed the included short stories. With that said, even though it was a shorted than expected, it was a great read and still deserves 5 stars. Also, I amped to see the movie interpretation (regardless of the fact that it's staring Will Smith..lol.)

B000002UY3|5.0|Hard to belive this album was put out in 1990. It, as well as all of Mazzt Star's albums, put you in a certain relaxed almost blissful state with blues guitars and haunting reverb added to the female lead singers voice. Lyrics are excellent and moving if you really listen to them, but can also run in a smooth array in the background as you focus on the music. I would recommend any Mazzy Star album; the consistancy is amazing!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young's 40 year career has had its high points but, while his songwriting skills shine through a great deal of his huge output, 1970 & 1971 were something special... and this brilliant live album shows why. Confident, controlled, clearly completely at home as the only man on the stage and with a string of new songs to showcase - many of which would become \\"Harvest\\" classics - this is \\"unplugged\\" music at its very best, beautifully sung & played and enhanced by crystal clear recording & engineering. And, unlike many live albums, his between song reflections and introductions add real depth & interest to the performance to produce a wonderfully effective record of what it must have been like to be there. Breathtaking stuff and an absolutely superb CD...    ...and then there's the DVD. Don't think that this is a \\"normal\\" video of the concert, because it isn't... what it is is some fairly reasonable but shaky hand held film of several of the tracks interspersed with grainy film clips of Neil Young's ranch and a lot of even grainier \\"filler\\" shots of spinning tape recorders and dark silhouettes of him hunched over his piano. Intriguingly atmospheric in parts but all very odd, particularly as the BBC has an excellent high quality video, recently aired on UK TV, of him playing a shorter version of the Massey Hall concert only a month later that's not available on DVD. If this is intended to be, as it says on the liner notes, part of a \\"definitive\\" collection of his career then why not dosh out the dough and include the much, much better BBC video here, which is, after all, the most obvious place for it? Ah well, at least the other items on the DVD - including a great deal of memorabilia, videos of two tracks filmed several months later and an extensive interview with Neil Young about the period, filmed in 1997 - are genuinely interesting. But that's the man for you... brilliant (CD) and frustrating (DVD).
0316067598|4.0|Reading this book is like having a conversation with Marcus. This is a riveting account of a mission that ended badly, and my wife and I had a hard time putting the book down when it was time for lights out. We bless the day Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Team 10 and Class 228 members agreed to serve and protect. These guys are the real deal, and their story is not to be missed!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Zodiac\\" quite a bit.  The acting is mostly excellent, the story is interesting, the visuals are effective, and the sound track is good. That is, like a good sound-track, it underscores the film without attracting attention to itself. A couple of period hit-singles are also used, including Donovan's 1968 \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\", which plays at the outset, and then accompanies the opening scene and initial murder.    The violence is graphic, though not intolerable.  In fact, even though I am definitely not a fan of horror shows, I am impressed by the \\"execution\\" of the stabbing sequence during the second murder.  Mostly indirect, but very convincing--especially when the girl's body rolls toward the knife. AND the camera.  Powerful.  In a later scene, he threatens a young mother whom he given a lift, that \\"before I kill you, I'm going to throw your baby out the window\\".  Thankfully we don't have to watch anyone being hurled out or mutilated.  She gets away.  Her fear is then compellingly portrayed by her maniacal behavior when she flags down the driver of a truck heading straight toward her.    Several actors turn in stellar performances in this gruesome epic. Robert Downy, jr. really knows how to play the cynical alcoholic journalist, Paul Avery.  Avery is one of people whose lives were destroyed in the wake of Zodiac's killings and menacing threats.  Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of the tenacious inspector David Toschi  is also quiet engaging.  Jake Gyllenhaal is good, but he seems a little too guileless to play the part of author Robert Greysmith.  He's fine as the \\"boy scout\\" sweet single dad who works as a political cartoonist and likes reading and puzzles.  But as the obsessed amateur sleuth who sacfices his family life and everything else in his life to dedicate to study, solve and write about Zodiac, he is less convincing.    Then there's Arthur Leigh Allen, played by John Carol Lynch. Mega creepy, but not over-the-top.  Some people say that in writing his book, Graysmith manipulates the data in order to try to \\"prove\\" that Leigh is Zodiac.  That may well be, but in the movie version, Lee Allen, with his zodiac watch and wing-walker shoes, is obviously the killer. The people can't pin it on him because the evidence is circumstantial.  Whatever.  Enjoy it as fiction, and Lynch's \\"Lee Allen\\" will chill your soul.  Especially at the closing scene, when he and Greysmith lock eyes in recognition.   \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" plays again, now sounding eerie and ominous.   Punchy, slovenly, creepy, Hurdy Gurdy, Zodiac Serial Killer Man. Shiver.
1596912855|5.0|When I first saw this book, I knew I wanted to read it, and when I finally did, I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the story immensely. Its nothing to take serious, its just a great book if you want to sit down and get lost in a story for a while. Its a quick read and totally worth it.   And for those of you who may be wondering, i'd say this book is quite appropriate for teens. (Provided you find kissing appropriate.)   I liked this book a lot and I think it would even be worth re-reading.
B00005JPQR|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.It's hard to believe, but this is a three-peat that works!   Jason Bourne is still trying to get to know who he really is...and it may not be good either! Matt Damon goes beyond himself in THE ULTIMATUM, and as far as I am concerned he has defined himself here as forever on the A-List of actors.I freely admit that \\"action\\" films are not my favorites, but The BOURNE series are something uniquely special in their writing and execution.    Having a reuniting with \\"the German Woman\\" from the first two installments,Jason goes to  London England where  he is more alone and more disassociated from people and himself then he has ever been.Wow, does Damon nail the pathos and suffering of Bourne at this point.It breaks your heart!  Jason has seen so much death that he starts to resemble it.It's a masterful piece of acting and lighting and clever camerawork.!This is where the action begins for Bourne in his mission to regain the knowledge of self  and soul.Joan Allen is in this one,and OH YEAH is she good!    I am stopping here! To reveal anything more would be a total disservice to this film.It is taut,nervous,roller-coastery and seamlessly edited to keep anyone glued to the screen. There is no down time.This one should bring in the Nominations if not the Awards!    TRY NOT TO READ TOO MANY REVIEWS.GO AND BE TOTALLY SURPRISED!
B000E1155E|5.0|Fantastic.  It is pretty much the only CD I play in my car since I bought it a month ago.  This band is genious.  The music is so tight.  I have never heard anything like this.

B000006NL3|3.0|Keep in mind that this album has the hallmarks of a low grade production. Vocals are muffled, guitars sound thin, there's hardly any bass, the drums are nowhere to be foud in the mix, and is ove-rmodulated as all hell. This album was designed to be listened to on an old cheap record player connected to cheap speakers. If your into collecting MFSL gold discs then this should be a nice addition in the \\"What Were They Thinking\\" file. Others save your money and just buy the standard aluminum disc.
1594200823|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend to me, and it has honestly changed the way I eat. The book is written so well, that it changes the way one eats depending on what parts of the american food system most bothers them. For me, it has lead me to review my hunting. I now will try to hunt more, as I feel this is one way I can honor the creatures that have died to feed me and my family. It changed my friend, by getting her started on her own garden. Basically, it is an eye opening adventure, and it lets you the reader decide which ways you want to effect our system. Great Book!
032147404X|5.0|As a novice, most of the books I found were too technical.  The author throws in humor to relax the beginner.  As he gets to the nitty-gritty, he gives you the answer without the technical explanation.  Such as how to set depth of field when you're shooting a landscape.  The deeper explanation can be found later, if your're interested.  This book was recommended to me by many camera clubs and I'm glad I have it.
B000RJO578|5.0|I'm not to big a fan of \\"comedies\\" these days.  In fact, I've pretty much stopped seeing comedies.  Every day there is a new one that comes out, filled with sex, poop and fart jokes (American Pie, and movies such as that).  Those movies disgust me, and I can't stand them.  However, once in awhile a great comedy comes along that I truly enjoy, and most recently this movie was Hot Fuzz.    Lets start off by saying that this movie is literally my favorite comedy of all time.  There's no question.  Also up there with my favorites is Shaun of the Dead, made by the same guys.  This movie is so witty and smart that I was blown away.  It's not one of those where some guy farts and everyone laughs, not at all.  You have to actually listen to what they say and what they show, and everything that is said or shown is played upon later in the film.  It's just incredible.      The acting is top notch, and Simon Pegg as a super-serious constable is flawless.  Nick Frost as his action-movie junky partner is equally impressive.  Besides the acting, the actual movie making and technology is quite astonishing for a comedy. It's seamless.  The action scenes are top-notch, making this not only a parody, but an action movie all in it's own. During these scenes, countless references are made to other defining action movies, most noticeably Bad Boys II and Point Break.  I could not stop laughing at a point when Frost shot his gun up in the air, instead of at his father, a scene straight from Point Break.      Everything in this movie is funny, and even when they are pretending to be serious, you just have to bust out laughing. This comedy is truly a work of art, and it propels itself far out in front of any other than I've ever seen. There are even some obvious \\"lets act stupid\\" jokes for those who aren't into analyzing movies, but they are well done and don't ruin the movies intelligence at all.    Again, this movie is considered a parody, but is a fine action movie itself. If you absolutely don't feel like thinking when laughing, then this is still a solid action flick wit hardcore action.  I highly recommend this movie for everyone (not children, of course), although a fair amount of pop-culture knowledge is needed to get many of the jokes. Regardless, this movie is a classic.  See it for sure, whether that means buying or renting, just see it.  Can't wait to see whats next for this movie-making team.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER may not succeed on every level. Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick S&uuml;skind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people.  The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers.  It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice.  The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat.  Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims.  When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.<br /><br />In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching. Grady Harp, August 07tting and moods created are well worth watching.

0684803356|4.0|This was my first time reading a book by Hemingway, and it was not all I had hoped for. The Spanish Civil War is one of my major interests (it was the subject of my undergraduate research thesis) and so I ordered this book with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was not completely satisfied.    \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" gives a great understanding of the personalities and characters of the Spanish people. It also is balanced in the sense that it shows that atrocities were committed by both sides.     However, my main complaint with the book is that it seems like nothing happens. It is not until probably the last 100 pages or so that action begins to take place. (Granted, there were many instances during the Spanish Civil War where the lines were at a standstill and nothing DID happen, so perhaps in that sense it is quite accurate). But despite how much Hemingway tries to build up to the destruction of the bridge, it's not exciting by the time you actually get to that point.    The other thing that irritated me (and this is just as a Spanish speaker) was that the dialogue is written as though it was literally translated word-for-word from Spanish conversation rather than translated for meaning. For example, the dialogue reads, \\"That he comes soon,\\" (\\"que venga pronto\\") instead of, \\"I hope he comes soon,\\" or \\"He better come soon.\\" It just makes the dialogue awkward and unnatural.     Despite my complaints, I will not let this be my only reading of Hemingway and I will try out something else of his in the near future.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Watching Daniel Craig reinvent James Bond in \\"Casino Royale\\" makes one wonder how fans ever tolerated the noble but graying Roger Moore in his later Bond films.  Craig's steel-blue eyes, clenched jaw, and massive shoulders remind us that Bond is first and foremost a killer.  Everything else - the women, the gadgets, the one-liners - are mere window dressing.    \\"CR\\" is the first James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming, and so the movie is essentially the prequel for the James Bond series of films.  The opening sequence shows Bond reaching \\"double-o\\" status.  His relationship with M (Judi Dench) is flinty.  And Bond is also naive about his new status.  After a bravura chase sequence in which Bond goes after a bomb-maker, one of those astounding urban acrobat types, Bond proves that he does not yet see the \\"big picture.\\"  Bond's poor judgment forces M to put him on hiatus, and so Bond heads to the Bahamas.      But Bond does not take anything lying down.  He knows that something is afoot with the bomb-maker he nailed in Uganda, and he needs to track down the guy who has hired the bomber.  Some clever detective work and opportunistic womanizing lead Bond to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker to the world's terrorists.  Le Chiffre is a bit reckless, however, and has some of his clients angry because he has lost their money.  All this leads to a huge poker game - no baccarat for Craig's Bond - where Bond, Le Chiffre, and the CIA's Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) go head-to-head.      In addition to being one of the most solid, well-crafted Bond movies ever, the delights in \\"CR\\" are found in how the movie plants the seeds of the James Bond legend.  We see how Bond forges his lifelong friendship with Felix.  We also see the birth of Bond's fondness for the vodka martini.  Perhaps most importantly, we get a little understanding about Bond's complex relationship with women after Vesper (Eva Green), a British banker, gets closer to him than any woman ever has.      A beautiful film shot on gorgeous locations, \\"CR\\" knows that the Bond franchise needed a huge shot of adrenaline.  \\"CR\\" gives it that shot and then some.  Welcome back, Mr. Bond.
B000002GQH|5.0|Admittedly, this 1969 release did not bowl me over at first, but after only a few listens On the Threshold of a Dream became yet another fantastic listening experience courtesy of the Moodies.  Of course, like all of their albums, the combination of excellent vocal harmonies, moodiness, and heavy use of the mellotron won me over - in fact, I would rank this album right up there with their other 1960s output including Days of Future Passed (1967), In Search of the Lost Chord (1968), and the superb To Our Children's' Children's Children (1969).  Overall, this is a fine example of proto-progressive rock and shows the Moodies delving ever further into the exploration of philosophical/spiritual themes.<br /><br />The instruments used on this album, while not as numerous as those used on In Search of the Lost Chord, are still varied enough to generate a rich palette of tonal colors.  The vocal harmonies are also superb.  The range of music on this album may be a little wider than on previous LPs and spans the gamut from Ray Thomas' cheery and bouncy Lazy Day to Mike Pinder's experimental and \\"progressive\\" three-part Have You Heard suite, which runs a bit over eight minutes in length and is a personal favorite.  Mikes acoustic piano work and mellotron playing on this track is extremely tasteful and well-done.  Justin Hayward includes his usual outstanding compositions including Lovely to See You; the haunting and sublime Never Comes the Day, which features some pleasant acoustic textures and superb mellotron playing; and the gloomy Are You Sitting Comfortably.  The experimental introduction In the Beginning is somewhat disquieting and compositionally distinct from the other tracks - it consists of sound effects and spoken word parts.  What I found especially disquieting was a brittle and dry voice that uttered spoken words over the frantic ticking of clocks.  I almost felt relieved when that ended and a calmer spoken word followed up with the confident reassurance to \\"keep as cool as you can\\". For me, the only piece that really is not up to the usual high standard of excellence is John Lodge's driving and bass heavy To Share Our Love, which seems a bit forced and is a lot heavier than most Moodies material.  This really is a minor complaint when you consider the high quality of the other material on the album.<br /><br />This remastered version is pretty good and features restored cover art along with a somewhat informative \\"question and answer\\" session.  The sound quality is very good.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent Moodies album and is highly recommended along with Days of Future Passed, In Search of the Lost Chord, To Our Children's' Children's Children; A Question of Balance (1970); and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971).l as you can\\".

B00007KWI9|4.0|This 1969 debut by Yes is quite distinct from their 1970s masterworks of symphonic progressive rock, yet stands on its own as a very listenable bit of psychedelia.  There is also the beginning of the trademark Yes sound, which is very much in place with Chris Squire's thunderous, trebly bass lines, Bill Bruford's drumming and Jon Anderson's voice.  Although I generally listen most often to the 1971-1977 material, this is still an excellent album of psychedelic rock that finds its way into heavy rotation.<br /><br />The lineup at this early stage in the development of Yes included Jon Anderson (vocals, tambourine); Tony Kaye (Hammond organ, piano); Peter Banks (acoustic and electric guitars; vocals); Chris Squire (Rickenbacker bass guitar, vocals); and Bill Bruford (drums, percussion, vibes).  Although there is some good playing here, especially by Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, the playing is somewhat restrained and not characteristic of the wild, unchecked virtuosity that characterized definitive albums like Close to the Edge (1972) and Relayer (1974).  The playing is however, undeniably very tasteful and well executed.  Peter Banks works a few jazzy riffs on the electric guitar in here and there and his work on the acoustic guitar is also very nice.  The three-part vocal harmonies are superb throughout and demonstrate the band's fondness for groups such as the Moody Blues and the Beatles.<br /><br />The eight tracks on the album range in length from 2'37\\" to 6'33\\" and are all great examples of highly melodic, tuneful, psychedelic rock pieces played with a great deal of energy.  Come to think of it, many of the melodies and harmonies seem to simply revolve around and respond to Chris Squire's extremely loud and aggressive bass lines.  I don't mind it one bit though - his virtuosic bass lines and extremely trebly tone are a refreshing change of pace from the plodding and muddy-toned bass playing characteristic of that time (Greg Lake, John Entwistle, Jack Casady, Jack Bruce, and Phil Lesh are all notable exceptions to this generalization).  The songs on this album (and they are really just songs) are chock full of the strong emotion that would surface on many Yes compositions written in the 1970s.  The tracks Harold Land and Survival come to mind as good examples of this.<br /><br />This remastered album by Rhino is excellent and features both the US cover and the British cover (which is shown on this page) - come to think of it, my first exposure to this album was through the British LP.  The CD booklet features loads of informative liner notes by Mike Tiano and the lyrics to each song.  The bonus tracks are OK but really do not add too much to the CD apart from historical value maybe.  The sound quality is simply superb.<br /><br />All in all, this debut is significant in that one of the more influential English progressive rock bands was up and running.  There is also some great music to be found here, and amply demonstrates the bands mastery of harmony and melody.  Although a lot of Yes fans do not like this album too much, especially in comparison with their definitive masterworks, I think that this album has a great deal to offer.  Recommended along with Time and a Word (1970), which finds Yes using an orchestra, and some of Peter Banks work with his band Flash (Out of Our Hands, 1973).Phil Lesh are all notable exceptions to this generalization).

0451169514|5.0|Another great Stephen King book, and I don't like all of them.  I'm not a Stephen King horror fan, but I enjoy many of his books because they are so engrossing and have so much depth in the characters.  Therefore I usually don't mind if they run on long, what some people call bloat is actually what I enjoy out of the books.  That and his unique story ideas.     This is not a story about a shapechanging clown, it is a story about several children that come from various functional and disfunctional families, are terrorized by bullies, find friendship with one another and come together to fight a terrible monster.  Then later in life, after all but one have left Derry, Maine to find success, they are called back to fight the monster again.  It is these people that are the story.  The clown (IT, I won't spoil what ITt actually is) just plays the adversary in the story.       I find that I do usually find the endings in Stephen King books disappointing.  It is almost like he just runs out of steam after writing 1000 pages.  That or after reading that much I always expect a cataclysmic, life changing ending that is almost impossible to deliver.  This story, like many others, kind of just peters out in the end, but the story itself was worth the effort of getting there.
006072448X|5.0|I was shocked to read the negative reviews- I am an avid reader and I absolutely loved this book.  It is difficult to read, but it reflected the discomfort that Eva, the mother was experiencing.      As a \\"later in life mom\\" who had a thriving career, I related to her angst, selfishness and frustration with the changes in her marriage.  I handled things differently, but it was easy to see how the road could have turned in a different direction.      I have been so extremely judgmental regarding school shootings- obviously, it must be the parents' faults, right?  After reading this book, I can say that I don't know.  Are some children so disturbed that they can't be helped?  We acknowledge that adults can be disturbed or damaged, but yet have the illusion, as does the father in this novel, that children are inherently innocent.    I found the mother to be honestly confused, the father to be hopeful and blinded by love.  I finished this book unable to answer the question why something like this happens, who was to blame, how Kevin felt about his mother-- it felt very genuine- no nice tidy bow that answers something so enormous.     It took a few days to shake the \\"ick\\" after reading this.  It was a good ick- it made me think and look at something from an entirely different view. It's why I read.
0142004235|5.0|I just finished this book a week ago!  What an amazing story as told by an amazing author.      I tend not to provide a synopsis of the book in my reviews and I will continue that trend in this review.  I will say that East of Eden is basically a grand morality play using the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel as  its backdrop.      As in Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck throws in chapters that are very omniscient in scope, some might even say Biblical in tone.  It is in one of these chapters that Steinbeck basically asks the reader to make a choice between good and evil in his or her life.  I had to stop reading at that point and just think for a little while....that is the sign of a great author at the top of his game!       Highly recommended!!!
B000QXDEDG|5.0|All I can truly say is the theme \\"United we stand divided we fall!\\" This movie was an example of what can happen if people stick together. A small amount can move mountains. There was so much action in the movie I felt as if I was there at the battle as a spectator wishing that I could join the 300 men. This movie will keep your attention throughout.
0312995423|1.0|I read this book a few years ago and am just now getting to a review of it, so forgive me if I don't have all the \\"details\\".  When The Da Vinci Code hype was in full boil a couple of years ago I decided to read this novel to see what I thought about Dan Brown as a writer, without all of the conspiratorial \\"baggage\\" that would come with reading The Da Vinci Code.  I thought it would be a fairer way to experience Dan Brown's writing \\"Style\\".    And wow does he stink!!!!!!!!!!    The characters were boring, the dialogue was forced and inane and he had the  incredibly annoying \\"stylistic\\" habit of writing a sentence of dialogue in Spanish or German and then repeating again in English.  Yeah this is cool when it is a word or phrase that has some emotional depth or actually moves the \\"plot\\" along!  He used this \\"device\\" when someone had to use the bathroom or ordered a beer!  And Dan Brown uses this \\"device\\"  WAY too much, sort of like I have been using \\"quotation marks\\" WAY too much in this review.  My quotation marks have gotten old and pointless haven't they?  Get my point??    NOW...I am not a book snob!  I love many many types of books!  I love GOOD thrillers and I love classic literature.  I enjoy biographies and so on and so on.  The only thing I look for is if the writing is doing what it was trying to do, and if it was doing it well.  Based on that criteria..Dan Brown fails with this \\"book\\".
1400063515|2.0|So there are a few decent ideas in this book; it's just too bad that the author takes a million pages to make some rather simple points.    Yes, I was aware of basic psychological biases that humans have such as the recency bias and conservatism bias.     No, I don't care about NNT's childhood story, which he goes on about for pages on end to illustrate some simple points.    Lastly, NNT likes making up words and phrases that often include Latin words to explain his ideas (which aren't even new). This really over-complicates some basic points.
6305882606|5.0|I initially thought what a lot of people thought: this price must be a mistake.  But I went ahead and paid it anyway, and found that I actually enjoyed this movie 8 times more than the $10 DVD I'd already bought.   It's inexplicable but true! This 89er is identical in every way to my cheapo H&M, but when I put in the 89er, the plot is just more fascinating. The ideas bolder...The originality and zaniness sharper and fabulouser!  I've done blind comparisons with friends and they all agree. I blindfolded and deafened three random viewers and 1 senior citizen (for control) and had them watch each one, not telling them which was which.  Each independently agreed the 89 dollar Harold & Maude was up to 7.7 times greater than the lesser priced item.  So pay extra, people! You get what you pay for. BELIEVE!!
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock or John Huston proud to have made.  I read the original Robert Ludlum book when it first came out and found it one of those books you couldn't put down.  I remember staying up all night just to finish it.  The movie is as true to the book as anyone could want while constantly keeping wanting to know what will happen next.  The ending is the type that will satisfy just about everyone, and not what you expected. Except for the second ending which is kind of a throw away.    A short synopsys is that a man is found floating in the Mediterranean by a fishing boat.  He is in a wetsuit and has been shot twice in the back.  He also has an implanted device in his hip that gives the name and address of a bank in Zurich.  The man (Jason Bourne) doesn't remember who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the numbered bank account.  So he heads off to Switzerland.  From there everything else follows; he finds money, six passports and a gun.  So who am I and what do I do?  Well my first guess would be that your a spy, but in the movies it's never that simple.    There are a couple of incidents that don't ring true: 1)how he crosses the border into Switzerland on a train without a passport is not explained, 2) how Marie manages to park behind the bank when no else is parked there,   3)having been on the fishing boat for three weeks his hair looks like he had it cut yesterday (in fact it looks that way through the whole movie),  4)when he drives with Marie overnight to Paris (say twelve hours), sleeping in the car, when he awakes, he clean shaven, no stubble at all (and once again not a hair out of place)and 5) he doesn't seem at all surprise when he beats the crap out of two Swiss Police on his first night in Zurich.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This CD brought back memories of my teenage years. I enjoyed all 26 tracks thanks
0440241413|5.0|I have read the complete Shopaholic series several times. This first book is by far my favorite! Becky is a outrageous spender with a big heart, and I could identify with her character. She is one person who makes me feel better about my own Visa bill! Entertaining, mindless reading. Perfect for the beach or while traveling.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I agree with many of the reviews that gave this film five stars, although the ones I read described Ricci's character as she was described in the film's liner notes, as \\"a sex addict.\\" While this may be true based on her behavior when we meet her, what is clearly underlying this behavior is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) The \\"spells\\" she has are flashbacks and her compulsive behavior to re-enact the abuse (through violent and excessive sexual encounters with others) she endured as a child are clear signs of this. I bring this up not to sound all psychologist-y and to excuse her behaviors, but to bring light to the fact that most sexually abused girls/women will experience what Ricci's character went through and will be labeled a \\"sex-addict\\" and worse when really they are suffering inside and need someone to nurture and support them. A turning point for Ricci's character was when she wrapped the chain tightly against her so she could sleep. This is revisited at the end when she holds onto the waist chain while pulled over in traffic.  It was a beautiful and realistic representation of what we grasp at when we've been traumatized and have found a source of comfort to get us through the inner torment.     Some people have complained about how the film was shot, seeming too sexy-trashy at times and to that I would say this was done tastefully through what seems to be a film technique. It is clear the director was allowing us to see Ricci's character how others in the film saw her and allowed us the opportunity in the end to revise our perception of her once we got to know her and watch her transform.     There is more to this movie than meets the eye. I love, love, love it.
0440241901|3.0|I have read almost all of Sophie Kinsella's books, including this one twice. Though some parts of the book have redeeming qualities, overall this was not one of Kinsella's best. The part in the book when Jack goes on national TV is especially unbelievable. Who does that? In any case, if you are looking for an entertaining Kinsella read, stick to the Shopaholic series!
0743298020|5.0|one of my favorites.  Masterful,gothic-esque, mystery that leads you down a tangled web of assumptions, lust, love, and evil.
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|Just based on what's here, it's a waste of money. Run time is identical to the original release; no extended or additional scenes restored to the body of the movie so why bother. Just talking heads. If it turns out otherwise, I'll update my review.   Oh and I loved FIREFLY and SERENITY, I just want more of the movie!
B000002BQK|5.0|I have been a fan of Mariah for many years and I own every CD she's ever made. But this CD is completely different for me from the rest of them. Of course this excludes the Christmas CD. But this CD for me is like a journey through time.     1. Honey - This is the song that was the driving force for me to get this album. I love it. It's such a fun song.    2. Butterfly - \\"Spread ur wings and fly...Buttterfly\\" Need I say more?    3. My All - A beautiful ballad. This is one of my favorites on the CD.    4. The Roof - This song is probably without a doubt my least favorite song.     5. 4th of July - Beautiful song with beautiful lyrics.    6. Breakdown - Mariah & Bone Thugs = Classic hit!    7. Babydoll - I like this song. I don't know if I'd consider it a favorite, but I like it.    8. Close My Eyes - This song is absolutely beautiful. I love it. Deffiniatly a favorite for me.    9. Whenever U Call - This is the most beautiful goregous song on this entire CD. It is so beautifully sung. Thank you Mariah for bringing something special to this song.    10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) - Good dance song.    11. The Beautiful Ones (Mariah Carey with Dru Hill) - I was never a big fan of Prince until the \\"MUSICOLOGY\\" CD came out. But compared to Prince's version of this song - I like Mariah's better. Goregous.    12. Outside - This song without question is my all-time most favorite on this CD. It's absolutely wonderful. I love it.[[ASIN:B000002BQK Butterfly]]
B000O76T90|5.0|Boy,they just don't make'em like this anymore! Willis is perfectly cast as the wisecracking cop who is in the wrong place at the wrong time....or the right place at the right time?? Many quotable lines in the heart pounding fast paced action film! I thought Alan Rickman was incredible as the cold hearted methodical \\"Hans\\". Great stunts,story and characters make this one of if not the best action movie ever! The 2 disc DVD transfer is excellent and there are some nice extras.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I first heard Ev's Fallen, and absolutely fell in love with it, not a bad song on the CD.  I've been waiting for the open door for a while, and bought it the day it came out.  I had heard the single \\"call me when your sober\\" and though it was ok, but showed promise for the rest of the album.  When I first popped TOD in my CD player and Sweet Sacrifice started, I thought I had another gem like Fallen.  Unfortunately, anfter the first two tracks, the rest of the CD failed to impress.  I know that Fallen is a tough act to follow, but it just felt like the spirit wasn't there.  Maybe its fall-out from all the band trouble, and Amy doesn't have Ben to write lyrics for her ideas anymore.  For what its worth, check it out if you want.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This is a classic Newman/Redford movie and one of my favorite westerns. I know the story is loosely based on truth and the facts are inaccurate, but it still a very entertaining film! It's well paced with a nice mix of drama and comedy. I think the reason this film  went over so well is because the two stars chew up the screen every time they're on it. The two disc set has a nice transfer and lots of interesting extras.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns is absolutely fabulous.  We watched it twice right through as a rental and then bought it.  Some of the film's scenes are both poignant and funny, and some  are so magical that they transport you to the world of the cats.
B00005NVDF|5.0|If you are not sure if you will like a \\"Woody Allen\\" movie, I suggest you start with this one. It is one of his more straight forward films and it is funny! I am a fan,but I must admit that I like his earlier films (Play it again Sam,Banana's,Take the Money and Run,Sleeper,Manhattan,Annie Hall). There are some really funny scenes in this one. The scene where he is introduced to a blind date at his apartment is hilarious! The DVD transfer looks good,but the treatment could be better.
0765348276|4.0|A unique take on the immortality-through-cloning plot - to get your 'rebirth' you have to sign up for the intergalactic armed forces.  Though the story took a while to get going, seemingly because the author took too much time (or pleasure) in explaining how the immortality was going to work in his universe, once you get past the army cliches, the story becomes quite fun.  I like the alien races he created, and how he imagined our interactions with them to be.  The story really got GOOD in the last third of the book, so I expect the follow-on books to be just as good now that the universe is already explained.
B00005JPFC|5.0|I went to the theater to see this animated tale of a cleaver rodent who dreams of being a chef. The story is well written and seemed geared more for adults,kids should enjoy it too. The animation is incredible and some great voice work by Oswalt and company. I wrote this review after seeing this film in theaters and I am adding some comments about the DVD release.<br />The DVD has an excellent transfer but, the extras are a little thin for such an interesting film. I smell a 2 disc in the future which is bound to \\"tick off\\" consumers. There are two very good shorts on the DVD release to save this release from being rather \\"bare boned\\".
1594628858|4.0|\\"Right Ho Jeeves\\" was first published in 1934 in the UK, though was first published in the US under the name \\"Brinkley Court\\". The book is set in England and features Wodehouse's best known creations : Bertie Wooster and his valet, Jeeves. Bertie is the book's wealthy, good-natured and rather dim narrator. He's a member of the \\"idle rich\\" and, rather than having to work for a living, lives off an allowance provided by his uncle. He spends much of his time in the bar-room of the Drones Club, is fond of the occasional wager and has an appalling dress sense. Luckily, Bertie has Jeeves, to look after him. Without Jeeves, Bertie's life would be a mess : he makes an excellent hangover cure, his bets usually win and is intelligent enough to rescue Bertie from nearly any situation. He disapproves of Bertie's more garish items of clothing, and will - occasionally - take it upon himself to deal with the offending item.     The book opens with Bertie's return from Cannes, having spent two months on holiday with his Aunt Dahlia, his cousin Angela and Madeline Basset - Angela's best friend. Arriving back at his flat, Bertie is surprised to learn that Gussie Fink-Nottle has been a frequent caller in his absence. Gussie, an old school-friend of Bertie's, is something of a reclusive character : he doesn't drink, looks rather like a fish, prefers country life to the city and is a noted newt-fancier. Gussie has apparently fallen in love, and has - wisely - taken to visiting Jeeves for his advice on how to win the young lady's heart. However, following a disagreement with Jeeves about a white mess jacket purchased in Cannes, Bertie decides to take over Gussie's case.     By sheer coincidence, the object of Gussie's desires is none other than Madeline Basset - who, after the trip to Cannes, has returned to Brinkley Court (Aunt Dahlia's stately home). Bertie sends Gussie off to the stately home in question - though his motives aren't entirely noble. As well as spending time with Madeline, Gussie will also be delivering a speech at the local grammar school's prizegiving day - a job Aunt Dahlia had intended for Bertie. However, when word comes through that Angela has brokern off her engagement with Tuppy Glossop, Bertie and Jeeves race off to the countryside to offer their support. Naturally, Bertie's attempts to ease smooth things over land everyone in a great deal of bother.     A very easy and enjoyable read.
B0009X766Y|5.0|This is a classic film. I'm glad I waited so long to watch it again, as it felt like it was the first time. The Sting has an incredible cast and an engrossing story. If you've never seen it,it will knock your socks off,if you have you will still love watching the movie unfold. The DVD treatment is excellent with a stellar transfer and yes it is the correct aspect ratio! It also had a ton of interesting extras.

B000QGDIKM|5.0|Greatest album of 2007!!  Full blown Pumpkins at their best.  Strong guitar riffs, powerful lyrics and classic Smashing Pumpkins sounds.
B000O176Q6|5.0|I recently watched Enter The Dragon on the Voom HD Kung-Fu network, and it looked relatively good, but not great.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version obviously got a lot more attention, care, and cleanup.  It is by far the best looking and sounding version I've ever seen of the movie.  It sounds like the bass was tweaked quite a bit, because whenever Bruce would hit one of his signature punches, my subwoofer put out one heck of a thump.  It sounded great, if not a little over the top.<br /><br />Some of the signature grain of the original is still there, but the images are much more crisp and sharp than any other version.<br /><br />Definitely worth it for the Bruce Lee fans out there.
1574535811|5.0|I am so pleased to have such solid information on the diet and lifestyle connection to health, and to various diseases that plaque so many. I like that this is sicentificly supported, rather than just another diet book. I find it helpful that it is explained so clearly that anyone can understand how the results of the studies are done, and that it is so clearly related to our daily choices of the food we eat. I finished reading the book last week, and yesterday (8/02/07) I received my copy of the audio version of the China Study. I have just begun listening to it, after loading it into a playlist on my ipod. I'm near the end of CD 1 of 6 in all. It is very good so far. I like that I can listen while doing other things, and hear the information again, there is so much info that is worthy of hearing more than once.  The reinforcement of this type of information, helps me in my commitment to a healthier diet.   I look forward to hearing T. Colin Campbell in person speaking next month at Dr. John A. McDougall's advanced study weekend in Santa Rosa, CA. It is the very lifestyle he is refering to in his book/audio book.

0446605409|5.0|DeMille's character of NYPD detective John Corey had me from the beginning. His quick wit and sarcastic humor, even when under his breathe to no one but himself and you the reader will have you laughing out loud as you acompany him on assignments of danger and deception. Plum Island is a masterpiece of writing and will keep you on the edge of your seat and have your brain working overtime to try to \\"figure it all out\\" early. I highly recommend Mr. DeMille's works and especially the series in which our tongue in cheek detective will take you on the ride of your life. Kudos!
B0001I561E|5.0|If you like great comdey, exotic cultures, places, and people, magical fantasies (a genie), fast paced action, great, catchy songs, and the comedic talent of Robin Williams this is definitely the movie for you! No other Disney movie is better than this one!
0316018953|3.0|I am an absolute Harry Bosch fan and the many works over the years have delivered great reading satisfaction and pleasure as the character grows and develops.  Unfortunately for me, this latest work which I understand was first published in lesser form as a weekly, left a lot to be desired. The story was engaging enough but was far more predicatable and slower paced than any other Bosch novels I have read. I still think Connelly fans will want to add this book to their collection, but I hope for more in the next installment. After all, even a so-so effort from Mr Connelly will place far ahead of most authors in the mystery/crime writers arena.
B00005O3VC|5.0|After watching the musical production Monty Python's SPAMALOT this summer I could not resist in purchasing the DVD of this 1975 movie featuring the greatest comedy troupe ever! Here we are, 30 years later and it is still the most outrageous film with Monty Python. I think the real attribute is the work of Terry Gilliam's animation that was featured. This is a must for all Python fans and for those who have seen or plan to see SPAMALOT! Buy this DVD..You won't be disappointed!!!
B000RJO578|4.0|When you see the previews for Hot Fuzz and you look at the ridiculous title, you think that this is going to be Reno: 911 all over again.  When you buy the DVD on a whim and check it out, knowing that it has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost from Shaun Of The Dead in it, you are pleasantly surpised that it's not all that tongue-in-cheek, as the title and the previews suggest.  In fact, Hot Fuzz is a very well done movie chockful of English humor and bits and pieces of ultra-violence.  Much like Shaun Of The Dead, minus the zombies of course.  Definitely wasn't the dumb but funny movie I was expecting, Hot Fuzz is well-plotted with intelligent humor and over-the-top situations.<br /><br />Seargeant Nicolas Angel is sent to a sleepy little country village from London because he's literally such a great cop that he's making everyone else look bad.  Trying to fit in, and finding it extremely hard to do so, Angel is face with several grisly accidents that make him suspect the sleepy little village is not all that it seems.<br /><br />Written by Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg, this movie is not quite a classic, but definitely one I would recommend and watch again. If you liked Shaun Of The Dead or are just a fan of dry English humor, this will be a treat for you.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000000OQF|5.0|Although I've owned \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" for quite some time, I never, really considered reviewing it. However, since it celebrated its 20th anniversary on July 21st, I guess now would be an appropriate time to bring it up.  Even though AfD is a great album, it actually took some time to really grow on me. However, between Axl Rose's banshee vocals, Slash's crazy guitar work and the rest of the band playing their hearts out, it's easy to see that, when combined with such excellent songs, this album made an impression on American musical culture. What with the famous album cover and an amount of underlying drug references, little things only add up for this stunningly impressive, late '80s album.    Starting off with \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" we heard a guitar riff that combines the sleazy guitar tone of Ratt with the brute force of, say, a much heavier band like Megadeth. And with the opening chord sounding like part of the National Anthem (IMO, at least), the jungle-percussion section midway through, and Axl's definitive cry, \\"You know where you are? You're in the jungle, baby! You're gonna die!\\", it's easy to see how such an awesome riff-rocker solidified itself among countless, other legendary songs of the time. 10/10  \\"It's So Easy\\" starts off with a bassline and some no-frills snare drumming. The haunting guitar riff compliments Axl's voice, which, in this song, has a deeper, more Mick Jagger-esque sound. And with the catchy verses and nightmarishly nihilistic lyrics, this song definitely fills in the boots of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\". 10/10  \\"Nightrain\\" is a song whose adventurous lyrics stand as a double-entendre for drugs. Axl's voice is back up in the higher register as Slash wails his heart out on the pentatonic scales on his guitar. And as a matter of fact, this song is ideal to play in the night time. 10/10  \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" sort of reminds me of a musical version of \\"The Outsiders\\". Unfortunately, the song doesn't do it for me, as I don't ever seem towant to listen to it. 7/10  \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" has another drug references, but the music and the humor mask it enough that it doesn't really bother you. The salsa section used twice in here is a great moment for me, the guitar solo rocks, and the ending of the song is fun, as well. 10/10  \\"Paradise City\\" ends the first half of the disc as a six and a half minute epic in the vein of \\"Free Bird\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". Everybody is at the top of their game here, Axl giving some of his most powerful and spirited vocal work on the entire album, Slash shredding out one of the greatest guitar solos of all time, and Duff McKagan throwing in some nice bass work at the right time. What a classic this song is. 10/10  \\"My Michelle\\" is the complete opposite of the anthemic epic that was before it; Between the progressive, opening guitar work and the speedy choruses, Axl sings about dating a girl who lives a sterotypical hard life. Actually, the ending kind of reminds me of something that could be said in a movie. Although it's not the definitive song on the album, it's another, solid track. 8/10  \\"Think About You\\" is a beautiful song, a \\"half-ballad\\" as I would say, for it contains balladic lyrics with a rocking beat. The acoustic guitars in the chorus complement the electric ones, however, the ending seems to come out of nowhere. Nevertheless, a great song. 10/10  \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" was voted as one of the ten best songs of its decade, so that alone should give you some insight that it's a great song. The legendary guitar riff, which sounds like a melodic alarm, starts this six-minute love song off, which boasts some of Axl's most poetic lyrics around. The lengthy guitar solo is another bit of history you're going to love, and the repetition of \\"Where do we go now?\\", only adds to the beauty of the song. A true classic. 10/10  \\"You're Crazy\\" is a fast and furious song about staying away from that girl that only \\"wants you for your body\\", which Axl describes as being \\"CRAZY! oh my...\\". A good song to thrash around to, yet it keeps the melody a lot of the songs have. 10/10  \\"Anything Goes\\" a fun song that has plenty of double-entendres, sounds like somebody combined AC/DC with Alice Cooper. I love the swing section at the end, which displays some of Steven Adler's drumwork. 10/10  \\"Rocket Queen\\" is a lengthy, darker song at over six minutes. The last verse is based a lot on being friends with somebody, however, even with that and the fact that this is the last song on the album, \\"Rocket Queen\\" doesn't seem as introspective as you might think. Still, a great way to close the album. 9/10    There you have it, my review for \\"Appetite for Destruction\\". In my opinion, and in the opinions of many others, it's considered one of the absolute best albums of the '80s, up there with AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\", U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\". A relentless burst of guitar solos, Axl's legendary vocal work, and an overall vibe that's very different than later songs such as \\"November Rain\\" or \\"Don't Cry\\" makes Appetite For Destruction a five-star album in my book. Even if Axl's neck-deep in feuds with countless other, famous figures, the music itself is more than fine, and hopefully makes a great addition to your music library. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000QXDED6|4.0|300 is not the greatest movie ever made.  Let's make that perfectly clear from the get-go.  It is, however, visually breathtaking and filled with depth and clarity and lots and lots of fantastic images.  Born of the Frank Miller graphic novel, 300 is the story of Spartan king Leonidis who, when threatened with slavery and death by the immense Persian army and forbade to wage war by a group of inbred soothsayers, takes 300 of his most vicious warriors into battle to save Sparta from certain annihilation.  Waging a war against the vast superior forces led by the androgynous Man-god Xerces, Leonidis manages to hold his own with the Sparta brand of killing.  Based on actual events (loosely, I assure you) 300 manages to keep you entralled through scene after scene of ultra-violent battles and well-flexed abs.  Taking it for what it's worth, 300 is a highly stylized piece of entertainment.  Good story.  Erotic sex scene.  Blood.  Gore.  Decapitations.  Stab wounds.  Impalement.  Death.  And a hunchback with a funny hat.  All that is compacted into a visually stunning epic of Spartan magnitude.  If you came to see 300 expecting the new version of Citizen Kane, well... you won't find that, but what you will find is a fast-paced (mostly) CGI war movie with more catchphrases than you can shake a spear at.  Well worth the cash.  I've seen it no less than 10 times and I can't help but continue to want to see the scene in which the Persian messenger encounters Leonidis for the first (and last) time at the edge of the great black hole in the center of the city.  This is SPARTA!  This is AWESOME!  TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!!!<br /><br />Dig it!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I normally write long, progressive reviews, but considering who I'm reviewing, I'll make this short and sweet.  Different people will say different things about \\"1\\". Some will say it needs the more cult classics of songs such as \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", or \\"I Am The Walrus\\", but \\"1\\" reflects the more pop side of the Beatles. It shows how they dominated the American and English charts in their time. In addition, just the fact that they can put 27 songs on one disc makes me happy.  Opinions aside, this is the greatest rock and roll ever. What more can there be said? The Beatles = Timeless music. 1 = Five-star album for me. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|Here we have an extraordinary set that belongs in everyone's music library---twenty-two CDs, the entire catalog of the recordings Stravinsky made for Columbia, at an amazing bargain price. Everything is here: the ballets, songs, symphonies, chamber music, short pieces, cantatas and operas, including the complete Rake's Progress. The Firebird, Pulcinella and Petrushka ballets appear both in full versions and as suites. With a few exceptions (A Soldier's Tale appears only as a suite, without narration), it's all the Stravinky you will ever need.<br />The collection includes some historic performances from as early as the 1930s, with the composer at the piano, but most of the pressings date from the late fifties to mid-sixties, and the stereo sound remains fresh. Some individual pieces are better recorded elsewhere --- listeners would do well to seek out Rite of Springs by Gergiev, Solti, or Abbado --- but as a group, they make a strong impression, and I have not found better, more infectious readings of the Symphony in C, Jeu des Cartes or the Symphony in Three Movements. The voices of Adrienne Albert in the Cantata and the Gregg Smith Singers in the Mass deserve special mention. For me, they make the recordings offered here definitive. (Some other personnel is surprising. The piano quartet in Les Noces consists of the composers Aaron Copland, Roger Sessions, Samuel Barber and Lukas Foss.)<br />Stravinsky was getting along in years when he arrived at the Columbia studios, and he was not generally well regarded as a conductor in any case, but his performances benefit from the steady guiding hand of Robert Craft, who rehearsed the musicians in advance of the recording sessions, and who is indeed a fine conductor, as he has proven in his own recordings of Webern and Varese. \\"Robert is my ears,\\" Stravinsky said. There is no higher compliment, I suppose, and Craft deserved it. These recordings are his greatest contribution to Stravinsky's legacy.<br />The brief notes in the booklet are not everything one could wish, but they never are in bargain boxes like this. Sony has been sitting for years on a treasure trove of historic Columbia recordings it has not seen fit to release on CD. We should be grateful that for once, they  did something right.are not everything one could wish, but they never are in bargain boxes like this.

B000QUCNP4|1.0|Zodiac is a great movie.  I went to the theaters multiple times to see it.  This dvd is great for people who do not value their money and want to purchase it for the point of owning it on dvd. However, as a big buyer of DVDs no DVD has ever made me so sympathetic to renting since I've seen this.  Why?<br /><br />The company includes a preview for the Directors Cut DVDs coming out in 2008!  Forget that!  Where's the extras? Where's the Trailer?  Where's anything for that matter?  That junk should be included on this disc!  Lazy money hungry industry that cries about movie downloading has the nerve to Sell this for $20 hard earned dollars like it's nothing and then advertise to you about the beefy version coming in 2008.  Rent this folks!  Do not buy!<br /><br /> They are so shameless they will even include an ad for you...  They should have just told you the truth... \\"BTW Please remember to buy the version with all the stuff we should have included... here's a photo of the cover so you know what it looks like and it will include all this.  We just felt that ripping you off for $40. was more worth it since we felt the film was that good.\\"<br /><br />What I want to know is, why doesn't anyone combat situations like this. Fortunately I rented it and due to the ignorance of Paramount, I only have plans to pass word along to anyone else considering purchase so they either A) rent then buy the good one or B) just not buy at all.<br /><br />It's long overdue.  Just because it's just a movie doesn't mean it's not dishonest business.  Paramount, you should have waited... This DVD package is the pits just like your corporate cheating of an American Dollar!<br /><br />Keep your cash... buy something else... hopefully not Paramount!

B0001AVZA8|4.0|To be sure, Something's Gotta Give is a formula movie populated with formula types. Nicholson, for example, plays the same sort of hate-to-love-him misfit who redeems himself before the credits that he played in the more original [[ASIN:0767811100 As Good As It Gets]]. Having said that, the quality of the acting and directing make this as good as formula gets; which is to say, quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The characterizations, and the choices the characters make, are sure to ruffle the feathers of those with an ideological axe to grind. But ideological commitments are hardly the basis for a romance, or a successful relationship. Reeves is charming as the earnest, smart younger man who does everything right. The dilemma for Keaton's character is that he doesn't understand her the way that Nicholson's character does.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment is not with the choice Keaton's character makes--the movie would work either way. What's disappointing is that a character who has been portrayed as an intelligent, mature adult ultimately has her choice made for her. In that sense, the ending of the movie is a cop-out.

B000NIVJEU|3.0|I like to imagine that the writer who adapted Paolini's book for film pounced on the novel in this way: He grasps the book firmly by the spine and begins flipping through the pages with mild interest. He pauses on one and then with a swift motion he tears it out. He continues, ripping more and more pages from the novel, until the pages are fluttering to the ground like leaves in autumn. Then, out comes the red pen. He removes all traces of Du Vrangr Gata, among many other things. The entire ending is crossed out, and then, after many drinks at a local bar, he stumbles back to the book and rewrites it as a dogfight between Durza and Eragon. As he looks over his abomination, he grins dimly and quietly congratulates himself, before passing out on top of the script.    So, I think from that you can surmise what I thought of the film. I would have given it one star, but it gets another star because I think people who have not read the book generally will enjoy this film, and I gave this Blu-ray edition a third star because the quality of Blu-ray is really quite good, and if you've invested in an HD television (which I assume you have if you're considering this format), a dragon soaring across the screen at 1080p is simply dazzling, not to mention all that beautiful scenery is quite a sight to behold.    All in all, buying a high definition copy was worth it for all the eye candy, but if you're expecting the novel's beautiful storytelling, it just isn't there.
0316067598|5.0|This was one of the most powerful books I have ever read.  The first person view of such a traumatic, life changing, experience that many of us only can see in the movies.  What these courageous men do for all of us, which is beyond what any movie could convey, is spelled out in these pages.    I have a new respect for all of our Hero's serving in the military after reading this book.  I literally couldn't set it down and ended up reading the book in one day.  I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!    Thank you Marcus Luttrell!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I love this movie. Both Reese and Joaquine do an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter. However, while this music is what i prefer, its not even close to the original Johnny Cash and June Carter songs. If you don't mind that the music is totally different, than by all means enjoy this great movie of a musical genius's life, cocaine and all.
B000002B2X|5.0|This album is only 4 songs long, plus one hidden track (really goofy), but it boasts two of their best songs: \\"Brother\\" and \\"Got Me Wrong\\". These tracks showcase a lighter, acoustic side to AIC. \\"Right Turn\\" and \\"Am I Inside\\" are both great tunes, as well. If you are a fan, this is a must-have set. It was released between Facelift and Dirt, probably just to keep the fans happy. I enjoy it when bands try different approaches. This was a great addition to their discography.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Another perfect record, just like \\"Core\\" was. It is full of hits: \\"Meatplow\\", \\"Vasoline\\", \\"Interstate Love Song\\", and \\"Big Empty\\". But again, every song is great and there is a good variety of song types. Some that rock hard, some that are mellow, but they all have great hooks.     After this album, STP sort of mellowed out a bit and started incorporating more of a pop influence in their records. While I still enjoyed every moment, many fans were undoubtedly disappointed with the musical direction. I recommend the first two albums (this one and \\"Core\\") before you buy the rest. Just expect the last three albums to be different. They don't rock as hard.
B0000028M7|5.0|First of all, Alice In Chains are my favorite band that is defunct. Wait, you might say. Aren't they back together with a new singer? Well, yes, but the fact remains that it will never be the same without Layne at the helm. I have no doubt that they can still create awesome music, but it will seem more like a Jerry Cantrell solo album and less AIC.     Dirt is the definitive experience out of everything they created. It has the most classic songs, biggest hooks, most creative song-writing, and best vocals. Layne and Jerry are legends.   Don't buy this just for the hit songs: \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would?\\". While those are all classic songs that are simply incredible, every song on this album is great. I love to sing along to AIC, in the car, shower, karaoke, whatever. Some of my favorites are \\"Junkhead\\", \\"Dirt\\", and \\"Rain When I Die\\". The vocals are gripping: emotional, soaring harmonies, and haunting, vulnerable choruses. The subject matter is very dark and never lets up: this album is not for the faint of heart. It deals with drug addiction, death, and loss of loved ones, among other things. However, it also serves as a lesson to others about what drugs can do to a person. Layne was one of the most talented dudes around, and a heroin addiction took him from this world. When I heard he died, I felt like someone punched me in the gut. All that wasted talent, all the wonderful music he could have continued to make. RIP.  This is an album that should be at the top of anyone's collection, and while it isn't as easy to get into as more by-the-book bands, if you give this band a chance they will get under your skin. I own everything they have put out.

B000QFCD5O|3.0|I saw the reunited Asia in concert in Toronto on Canada Day weekend and this recording doesn't do the band justice. Carl Palmer's drumming at the Toronto show was astounding...he was the driving force behind the performance and his kit sounded incredible. But I find the drums are buried on this recording...I have to strain to hear some of his rolls because they're simply muffled. As well, John Wetton's vocals are too far \\"up front\\". The music needs to be a bit louder to achieve a better balance.    All that said, this is still a good performance and the \\"unplugged\\" versions of Don't Cry, The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and Ride Easy are fantastic.
B000QXDED6|4.0|But in a good way!<br /><br />This is \\"300\\", a movie adaptation of a comic book version of a historical event.  This movie cannot fairly be critiqued from a single perspective, so I'll look at it from several.<br /><br />As history: Not as bad as the most vocal critics would have you think, but consider it an inspiration to read about the actual events rather than a history of the events (unlike the old \\"I, Claudius\\" series, which had only a couple of historical errors).  \\"300\\" mentions most of the key events around the battle of Thermopylae.  Then the history goes downhill fast.  The costumes, the weapons, the armor, the role and nature of the Ephors, the terrain of Greece, the ships, and numerous other elements detract from the historical accuracy of the movie.  But this doesn't keep it from being a good movie, just don't watch it before that big history test.<br /><br />Visually: Overwhelming!  Miller's imagery presents very well on the big screen through Zack Snyder's direction.  It's from a comic book, so everything is larger than life.  The use of color was brilliant, and shapes the mood of the viewer with remarkable grace.  This movie overwhelms with vignettes of image, each more powerful than the last.  I was particularly impressed by the imagery of the Spartan phalanx, capturing the power, beauty, and lethality of a coordinated team that has been trained and forged into a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  On the other hand, I think Zack Synder is trying to do for American men what the fashion industry has done for American women (when I'm done typing, I need to do about 10,000 ab crunches, sit-ups, and flutterkicks).<br /><br />As a story (apart from history): Brilliant!  It's a story of a man forced to decide between his desires, the duties of his office, the laws of his land, and the future of his country (and of the world; had Leonidas and his comrades not fought at the hot gates, Persia would have shaped the world very differently than the inspiration of Classical Greece did).  Not an easy decision, and the factors shaping the decision are developed beautifully, and how the story of Leonidas and the 300 heros of Thermopylae shaped later events is mentioned at the end of the movie.  This story is well told.  It is also the story of Queen Gorgo, and one of the few cultures of the time that treated women with the respect they deserve.  Sparta was the only Greek culture of that time where woman could be heard openly in political discussion, and had greater equality than in any other Greek city (and MUCH better treatment than in Persia).  Ironic that in every other way, Sparta was the least liberal city of Greece.  The Queen was a powerful woman of integrity, and the treatment of her piece of 300 is respectful, well told, and shows the whole woman.  Congratulations to Lena Headey for a job well done!<br /><br />As having current, real-world impact:  I am amused.  The President of Iran's response to this movie is very telling.  Iran is what was Persia, and the majority of Iran are ethnic Persians.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad voiced complaints about this movie, that it portrayed Persians in a negative light, that it was propaganda a psychological warfare, and demanded that the U.S. government do something.  (Like anyone in Hollywood would do any thing for the Executive Branch these days.)  It's from a comic book!  This is as silly as China's complaints about Disney's \\"Mulan\\"!  Oh, by the way, the U.S. government doesn't control the movie industry, but Ahmadinejad clearly thinks it does.  But maybe Ahmadinejad was offended by a movie that had woman having a voice in a nation's policy.  Maybe he was offended by exhortations to stand up against tyrants, for freedom, the future, and the hope that (Greek) democracy brought to the world.  Maybe he was upset by the comicbook presentation of Xerxes.  Still, regardless of the reason, his demands to suppress the arts speak volumes about his vision for Iran and the world.<br />Nah, he was just upset that someone reminded the world that guys in pajamas (Persian trousers) were beaten by guys in skirts.<br /><br />As a source for leadership vignettes: pretty darned good.  The single best one is in the dialog between Leonidas and Xerxes, as they discuss the roles of leaders and followers, but Leonidas' talk with hunchbacked shepard who wished to fight alongside the Greeks, and the final monolog have much to offer also.<br /><br />There have been frequent criticisms of the way \\"300\\" presents the human figure, alleging that the film is soft-core homoerotic porn.  Critics shouldn't be so narrow.  If \\"300\\" is any kind of soft-core porn, it is pretty even-handed and diverse in its nature, especially in Xerxes' tents.  The movie is not for kids, and not for adults offended by human bodies or sexuality.<br /><br />In all, I enjoyed \\"300\\" and was moved by the final scene, where the entire story is placed in context by the narrator.  As a bit of a historian, I couldn't give it the fifth star, but that wasn't easy as I believe it captures the spirit of the Greek side of the Battle of Thermopylae well, despite uncounted historical inaccuracies and fabrications.

B00005JPQR|5.0|Wow was this a nice surprise!  After being dissapointed with \\"Hairpray\\" last weekened we decided to see the \\"Bourne Ultimatum.\\"  Matt Damon is great as jason Bourne! I am also a fan of Julia Stiles (LOVED her in \\"Save The Last Dance\\") and she came back for the conclusion of the Bourne series.  What a great finish!  Everything was great, the scenes, the acting, etc.  I never got bored from seeing this movie.  It was non-stop action from beginning to end. Think similar to \\"Casino Royale\\" but better.  I haven't seen the first two Bourne movies but now I want to after seeing this.  I would definately watch this movie again on DVD.  If you like action movies and CIA thrillers, I'd reccomend seeing \\"The Bourne Ultimatum.\\"  It's worth the money!
B000005IRG|5.0|Often cited as one of the NYC bands that helped inspire the \\"punk rock\\" movement in the 70's, Television is typically lumped-in with the punk bands that followed, but this is a tragic mis-characterization. Television certainly shared some of punk's elements: spare instrumentation, raw youthful energy, and a \\"street rock\\" rejection of the overindulgences of 70s era musical and visual style. But unlike the bands that followed, Television did this with a keen musicianship, that was equal to the intensely inventive spirit of their songwriting. This is why their debut album still remains fresh today and deserves recognition as a unique document that has all the qualities of the highest forms of musical art. I fully expect that hundreds of years from now those interested in and knowledgeable about electric guitar music will still be listening to the work of Television while their contemporaries are long forgotten.    Perhaps it takes a musician to truly appreciate the sheer brilliance of Marquee Moon. The inventive guitar interplay of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd over the equally inventive rhythmic foundation of drummer Billy Ficca and bassist Fred Smith puts every other rock foursome of the time to shame... both in sheer originality and musical sophistication. Most of the bands that followed eschewed serious musicianship and offered little more than youthful rebellion driven ever harder to a new level of speed, attitude, and volume. Television cracked open a door to a different kind of music, one that combined the raw attitude of rebellious youth, with a musical sophistication rivaling that of creative jazz, a fresh musical alchemy all their own that remains influential long after the raw appeal of punk has run its course.     For those looking for punk head-banging over densely hammering chords, this recording is not for you. For serious musicians and others interested in the deeper creative possibilities of guitar, bass, and drum rock music, Marquee Moon remains an essential and timeless artifact that defies categorization, and still inspires awe in Those Who Understand.
B00005JPQR|5.0|The enigma that is Jason Bourne (a focused, determined, conflicted performance by the terrific Matt Damon) is almost (there is indeed room for a Bourne4) un-masked by the end of this film: the newest installment of a series of now three excellent films; the last two directed by Paul Greengrass who also directed the staggeringly focused and shatteringly emotional \\"Flight 93.\\"<br />On the very basic level, through all three films, Bourne has been on a quest to find himself: who he is, who he was and why he does the things that he does.

0553588486|5.0|While I appreciate sci-fi and fantasy, I am far from a die-hard fan.  Like most readers, I came to the genre during my younger years, only to find, as I got older, that certain themes and archetypes repeated themselves with annoying and predictable regularity.<br /><br />With \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" George R.R. Martin has written the rare novel that is likely to appeal both to readers who are, and readers who are not, fans of the standard sci-fi/fantasy conventions.<br /><br />The book does away with many of the more tiresome fantasy standards.  Gone are much of the altruism, heroism (and lots of other -isms) seen in most books of this kind.  There is no \\"Dark Lord.\\" There is no all-powerful magical artifact that must be (a) discovered or (b) destroyed.  There aren't really any magical critters running around--for the most part, the action in the book occurs the old fashioned way: people killing other people.<br /><br />The premise is straightforward and believable: the crown of the realm is up for grabs, and everybody wants it. While there are several factions struggling for control, there is no readily-identifiable \\"evil\\" or \\"good\\" side; each would-be sovereign believes that their claim is justified, and from time to time, every character employs means that are something less than noble.<br /><br />The events in the book are founded on an epic backstory, which is only hinted at in the course of the narrative, but which leaves the reader with the distinct impression that NONE of the characters is above a little foul play from time to time. This is probably the greatest strength of Martin's book: his examination of the everyday evils committed by regular people, all justified as the means to the ultimate end of the \\"greater good.\\"<br /><br />The cast of characters is enormous, and it's almost worthwhile to take notes as you read, as new characters are introduced in almost every chapter. Martin won't hesitate to kill any of them, either--even the ones you may believe the book is \\"about.\\" This creates a much more realistic narrative tension than in most books of this kind. In most fantasy stories, when the characters find themselves in trouble, the reader finds himself wondering HOW they'll pull through. In this book, once the reader realizes that no character is safe from the seemingly capricious stroke of Martin's pen, he is more likely not HOW, but IF the characters will escape danger at all.<br /><br />Don't think that the story is totally of devoid of sci-fi/fantasy goodies: the setting of the story is a world in which summer can last for years at a time, and winter for more than a decade.  While there are no characters with magical or supernatural abilities, it is strongly hinted that this may soon change.<br /><br />Whether or not you're a fan of \\"classic\\" fantasy, give this one a try.ch more realistic narrative tension than in most books of this kind.

0385486804|5.0|I found this brief account engrossing.  The story of 24-year-old Chris McCandless' intense efforts to live a \\"pure\\" life in the Alaskan wilderness, his naïve but brilliant sacrifices, his perambulations across America, as well as his childish posturing and late adolescent hang-ups, culminating in a study of how he inadvertently killed himself by ingesting neurotoxins in wild potato seeds, rings true with anyone who ever daydreamed like Tom Sawyer, Jeremiah Johnson, Jack London, and Daniel Boone.  This goofy kid could have been so much, had he just tried to live life a little less intensely.  Although he was a young fool who died foolishly, I believe we can all relate.

B00062RCBW|4.0|I'm really glad that I have the entire seven seasons of Star Trek: TNG.  I wanted it for a long time.  However, after receiving the collection and watching a few episodes, I was disappointed. I was expecting better video quality.  And, I hope I'm not the only one with the following problem.      Specifically, the DVDs that I have watched thus far have superior audio, and the video stream is smooth but has poor color contrast.  The picture has an overall dim background brightness, rendering a poor contrast between light and dark objects.  This makes it difficult to see everything in the scenes.  The brighter elements are okay and the darker colors and background elements are barely viewable or not viewable at all.  Examples include scenes of video where the Enterprise is orbiting a planet, inside scenes of the Enterprise with Captain Picard, Commander Riker, Counselor Troy, etc, and other interior shots where the darker colors of actors' uniforms, and background objects which were, again, barely identifiable/viewable on the screen or not viewable at all.  I thought, perhaps, my TV was the problem or maybe even the DVD player, so I conducted a few tests.    First, the TV was evaluated.  It is not possible to adjust picture elements like the contrast or turn the brightness up on my TV enough to have the picture to appear normal and get the background colors to come out correctly.  When I do turn the brightness enough to somewhat see the background elements, the rest of the picture (lighter elements) washes out.  So, I put the same episodes into my computer, which has an LCD monitor.  Although the picture came out a little better, the problem remained.  Now, I happen to have many VHS episodes of Star Trek: TNG.  I compared some identical episodes using both DVD and VHS formats with the same TV and DVD/VHS player, with a follow-on plan to then try more tests using a different TV (computer monitor) and player.  So, I watched a couple of the episodes that I had on both DVDand VHS.  The VHS versions played well and the video was normal for both background and foreground viewing brightness and color identification.  Continuing on, I tried the DVD on another DVD player hooked to the same TV with the same poor results.  I also tried using another VHS player on the same TV, played the identical episodes on it, and the picture quality was great.     My conclusion is that the Star Trek: TNG DVD collection was recorded incorrectly or at too low a brightness level.  Whatever the cause, the poor video quality is unacceptable.  Unfortunately, I passed the warranty period because it took me too long to view enough video episodes to know this was a systemic problem.  And, I really don't want to give up my collection since the next set I purchase will undoubtedly be the same.  I say this because I own Star Trek, the original series and it is too dark, as well.      All I can say is that I will not purchase any other Star Trek series until I know I'm getting something substantially better than mediocre video quality and offered quality replacement DVDs for my current two collections.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|There is a sadness, a desolation to this music which adds to its beauty. The title track, from a selective interposing of acoustic guitar and electronics to the thoughtful, intelligent lyrical reflections of the author, bathes intimation of loss in a melodic beauty that makes us yearn for more. I don't know its appeal to be truthful. I've loved this album thirty years and cannot imagine thinking less of it in thirty more. Every track is strong. More remarkable still is that the atmosphere of the piece is maintained throughout. Of course sometimes things just come together. For Al Stewart things came together with 'Year of the Cat'. They have never been the same since, for him or the rest of us, and if I died tomorrow and all I could claim was authorship of an album like Year of the Cat I would face St Peter with a degree of confidence. Another reviewer is quite correct: this is not for lovers of rap, house or similar. It is for music lovers - of any age - with a brain.

0515127485|5.0|British author Harris' literary thriller is a compelling, suspenseful novel of contemporary Russia and its Stalinist legacy. The narrative rests on a dangerous foundation of shifting momentums; control of events slipping from one ruthless character to another, paralleling the fate of Russia itself.<br /><br />As the novel opens Papu Rapava, one of brutal Beria's bodyguards, recounts the night of Stalin's fatal stroke to a foreigner who plies him with drink and who Rapava addresses as \\"boy.\\" \\"By this time the girl had stopped screaming,\\" Rapava recalls, noting that the call had come about 2 a.m. and he had been the sole guard as was customary \\"when there was a girl.\\"<br /><br />The interviewer, as drunk as Rapava, is \\"Fluke Kelso,\\" middle-aged former Oxford professor of Soviet history, in Moscow for a conference of historians, desperate for a book to revive his stagnating reputation. His excitement grows as Rapava describes a macabre scene: he and Beria rifling Stalin's paralyzed but conscious body for keys to his private safe, seizing his secret papers, abandoning Stalin to his fate. In the pre-dawn hours Rapava, sweating at the prospect of his own death, digs a grave-like hole. But only Stalin's papers are buried and when Beria is executed several months later, Rapava keeps the secret, which he alone still holds.<br /><br />Despite his mounting excitement, Kelso is sick in the bathroom and Rapava flees during his absence, leaving no proof of his story and only a discarded nightclub matchbook as a clue to his whereabouts. A set-up, one of Kelso's respected colleagues assures him. A set-up to extract money from the wealthy foreigner. But Kelso, in the grip of hangover as well as ambition, can't let it go.<br /><br />The details of Rapava's story take Kelso to the Lenin Library, where tantalizing confirmations lead him to confront the murderous Mamantov, a former KGB officer and reactionary Stalinist. Heedlessly, typically, Kelso does not reflect on the possible repercussions of this meeting but simply blunders on.<br /><br />While the historian stumbles feverishly through Beria's former residence, now an abandoned embassy, Mamantov escapes his official surveillance and disappears. When Kelso finds proof - a disturbed plot of dirt that matches Rapava's description of the burial place - his own inertia plunges him into the murk of Moscow nightlife where career women moonlight as prostitutes, salting away dollars, Rapava's daughter among them.<br /><br />Kelso becomes a catalyst for events which spiral out of his control. His headlong yet skillful search ignites the fears and ambitions of various splintered Russian power groups - police, state security, the heart of government and the forces of revolution.<br /><br />Harris' (\\"Enigma,\\" \\"Fatherland\\") skillfully drawn characters appear real without being deeply complex. Kelso himself is a crafty, misanthropic, venal sort, but not unsympathetic. While you can't root for his success, you don't want him to die.<br /><br />Combining the unexpected with the brutal and crafty to build a complex, atmospheric plot culminating in a surreal, heart-stopping chase through the frozen hinterlands, Harris constructs an equally surreal but convincing picture of the Stalinist fervor that lives on in Russia, a strange, creepy nostalgia for a dictator who killed between 45 and 66 million people.<br /><br />And without letting it escape him, Harris manages to secure his plot in a maelstrom of murderers, mobs, the frightening power of unwitting international television, the sweep of historical forces and the harsh reality of post-soviet daily life.

0316067598|5.0|Fictional thrillers about elite combat units pale by comparison to this true story.  All Americans should read this book to learn what our armed forces are doing to prepare for and engage our terrorist enemies . . . and how difficult and dangerous those tasks are.  The book squarely poses the question of whether military or civilian lives should have greater priority in terrorist combat.  In this case, following the rules of engagement seems to have led to the deaths of many SEALS and other American military personnel . . . as well as the deaths of many enemy combatants.<br /><br />The story of Lone Survivor focuses on a mountainside battle during which four SEALS were outnumbered about 35 to 1 by Taliban forces that were protecting an al Qaeda leader.  The SEALS were in a tactically compromised situation with no adequate communications to call for help.  The SEALS defended themselves as vigorously as anyone could, and three of them died despite amazing heroism and great training.  The fourth SEAL, Marcus Luttrell, survived only through the grace of God and the protection of Pashtun tribe while being tracked and menaced by the Taliban.<br /><br />Before the battle, Lone Survivor moves backward in time to describe how Leading Petty Officer Luttrell became a SEAL and how even that intense training wasn't nearly as demanding as combat turned out to be.  The book concludes with his rescue, recovery from his wounds and illness, and fulfilling his promises to his comrades.<br /><br />There's a lot of heartbreak in this story.  You'll be changed by what you read and how you feel about what happened.<br /><br />As an American, I feel very proud of those who serve in the American Armed Services and feel enormous gratitude to the elite units for the special risks and rigorous training they endure for our sakes.<br /><br />But never would I have imagined that duty would call four \\"frogmen\\" to battle so many Taliban on a mountainside near the roof of the world.  We should all honor the sense of duty that leads brave men and women to answer the call to go so far beyond what it would seem mere mortals could hope to accomplish to protect us all.<br /><br />May God bless our troops!leads brave men and women to answer the call to go so far beyond what it would seem mere mortals could hope to accomplish to protect us all.

B00AEFY5B6|5.0|With Kubrick gone and Spielberg in semi-retirement, Ridley Scott is now arguably our greatest director.  Gladiator is a great cinematic achievement, grasping the concept of honor, courage, and duty in the story of a Roman general(Russell Crowe).  He believes that Commodus(the new emperor) did in the prior emperor and will not promise allegiance.  It's a fateful error and he's brought down.  He must flee in exile and return as a gladiator, doomed to fight to the death in the Colosseum in Rome.  But the way he does it, with efficiency and honor, we are drawn into his fate and care for him, and the nation(Rome).  The themes are so universal that at the end, you feel that you've reviewed not just his life, but your own...<br />Now, to be sure, this is Hollywood.  In reality, there's no hard evidence that Commodus(the young emperor who secures the throne) ever did in his predecessor.  His sister far from being a victim was, by some sources, part of the conspiracy not of him but against him.  Eventually, this young emperor was himself done in by the seemingly endless Roman tradition of conspiracy and turmoil.  But, as with all films, we can forgive some poetic license and just sit back and enjoy a masterfully presented story...

075640407X|2.0|I had, in general, mixed feelings for this book.<br /><br />I read many reviews on this book before I decided to purchase this novel (most were strongly positive but there was the occasional, not so impressed, review). Now having finished the book I find myself on the lower side of the middle.<br /><br />There were areas of the book I did like...for instance.<br /><br />1.)I enjoyed the overall concept of this medieval story (that being the retelling of a life's journey by the hero [Kvothe]); it was well done.<br /><br />2.)There were moments (unfortunately, few and far between) of intense danger and foreboding at different parts of the story that really added a wonderful, disquieting atmosphere to these surroundings.<br /><br />3.)I found the story (and maybe the overall quality of writing) seemed to improve towards the latter 3rd of the novel.<br /><br />4.)There was an adequate map.<br /><br />5.)It had an interesting ending, which hopefully bodes well for book 2.<br /><br />The Cons:  (which eventually seemed to take over and generally overshadow the good features of this novel)<br /><br />1.)I found there were areas of this novel a slow moving (almost to the point of thinking about skimming through them).<br /><br />2.)Some of the problems Kvothe had with money (debt), his girl friend and some of his university associates, seemed the be quite repetitious. It just seemed that for all his special \\"talents\\" he never seemed to learn from previous encounters and frequently used questionable judgment. I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated with each recurrence of these shortcomings.<br /><br />3.)the repetition of [2.) above] seemed to give this novel extraordinary length; this novel could have be a couple hundred pages shorter and not suffered any major ill effects.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />An interesting first book, however, I hope the author is able to correct some of the perceived weaknesses in his next installment. 2 Stars.<br /><br />R.

B000AWYOGE|5.0|Usually if I watch a movie I don't like, I never watch it again. However, I gave Dark Water a second chance and I'm so glad I did! Dahlia is a woman with problems, and this movie lets you make up your own mind whether they are psychological or paranormal. I personally feel like it was a combination of both. This movie just gets better and better every time I watch it. I truly feel like Jennifer Connelly is this generation's best actress, and I feel she's so underrated.
B000AA305M|3.0|I can't really say I am a big David Gray fan. I like a few of his songs and that is about it. I decided to check out his most recent studio album LIFE IN SLOW MOTION from the library because I love the country-tinged song \\"The One I Love\\". Unlike WHITE LADDERS (the last album I heard by David), there were more songs I didn't care for than ones that I liked. This is not the case here on LIFE IN SLOW MOTION. David's vocals didn't bother me so much since I last heard his music a few years ago. LIFE IN SLOW MOTION is chockful of infectious melodies like on \\"The One I Love\\" and \\"Slow Motion\\". The only song I wasn't wild about is \\"Nosda Cariad\\" but overall I loved LIFE IN MOTION as a whole.<br /><br />I would have given this cd a higher rating but no thanks to Sony freaking Records and their stupid attempt to copy protect their product, I could not listen to LIFE IN SLOW MOTION on my iPod. I was able to load it onto my iTunes and iPod but the music sounded like s**t. Thanks a lot Sony for reminding me why I don't like you and every other major recording label.

Not only does this book talk about the painter's life, but more importantly, each of J.W .Waterhouse's paintings are described in very full detail (eg: OPHELIA).<br /><br />I was so intrigued by reading about Waterhouses' pictures, because the author of this wonderful book (ie: PETER TRIPPI) elaborated in great detail about each work of Art, by contrasting and comparing Waterhouses' paintings to other famous paintings and sculptures (eg: Bourne Jones from the 1800's,  and also many famous Italian 1400-th Century Artists) .<br /><br />The author has attempted, (& with great success, I may add), to show how Waterhouse was influenced by past Rapheaelite Artists and also by some of the other famous first-phase Pre-Raheaelite English Artists.<br /><br />Each synopsis, of each Waterhouse painting is quite amazing and like no other interpretation that I have read on this famous late-Pre-Raphaelite Artist.<br /><br />The repro-photos of Waterhouse's works are amazing, -----showing such wonderful details and colors.
038572179X|5.0|I've been on a McEwan kick for the last few months, and Atonement is, by far, his best book.<br /><br />This book begins with the events of a sleepy summer day at the Tallis family's English estate.  The consequences of this day unfold over the years.  From the war-torn French countryside to a pre-Blitz London and beyond.<br /><br />The pace of this book is perfect.  McEwan floats us along a hot summer day, then engages a sense of urgency as the conflict unfolds.  The atmosphere is heavy with rich detail.  The characters are honest and sympathetic, even when we want to scream at them.  McEwan is a master at writing inner dialogue, and this book delivers his best in character development and delivering scenes from multiple perspectives.<br /><br />It's no wonder this book has become the darling of book clubs and required reading lists.  It is an all-encompassing journey in innocence, discrimination,  blame, consequences, humility, and above all, atonement...

Nonetheless this is a really good album that predates the above mentioned. The first and last tracks are quite lengthy but still very interesting to listen to.  I have collected the majority of Pink Floyd's cd's recently and all are very enjoyable to listen to because you can see their development from one album to the next. It is my belief that many bands really do not develop in this manner anymore because of the general population's short attention span or the search for one hit wonders.

1594489505|5.0|Well written and it takes the reader into the sordid, sad lives of women and female children in Afghanistan. For me, the background setting of the Russian invasion, and the turmoil up to this century is nothing compared to the treatment Afghan women have gone through. It is time to stop the inhumane treatment of women and children in the world now. Bettye Johnson, award-winning author, Secrets of the Magdalene Scrolls.
B0002OOUP0|5.0|This is a great collection of Rolling Stones classics from the years 1971 to 1993!!! Okay not every hit from that time is is on the disc,but it's still one hell of a collection,most of the BIGGIES are here!!! Some of the great classics contained on this great disc are:Brown Sugar,Wild Horses,Beast Of Burden,Tumbling Dice,Miss You,Start Me Up and many more great rockin' Stones classics!!! Some more obscure hits are also included here such as Harlem Shuffle and Hot Stuff!!! This would have been probably better done as a 2 CD collection,so classics such as Happy,Can't You Here Me Knockin',Ain't Too Proud To Beg,Time Waits for No One,Shatterd,She's So Cold,Hangfire,Little T&A,Rip This Joint,Heartbreaker,Dance Little Sister and so on could be included!!! But even with it's faults,it's still a five star collection,excellent 20-bit remastered sound quality!!! Maybe a larger collection will be released someday,but for now,this collection will have to do!!! Five stars!!! A+
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The sense of smell has never be so compelling and so wonderfully put on film then it has in \\"Perfume - Story of a Murderer\\".<br /><br />The movie takes place in Paris 300 years ago and tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by Ben Whishaw, who is an orphan with the best sense of smell in the world.<br /><br />Jean's goal in life is to make a perfume that captures the esseance of smell and never goes faint, a perfume so potent that people loose track of all reality.

The preformaces of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille by Ben Whishaw is a wonder to watch...you see a little Hannibl Lector in him.<br /><br />The DVD does the story justice and I can't give it enough praise without sounding like a rambling idiot anymore.  For a uniniqe vewing experince everyone must check this movie out.

B000RJO578|4.0|Hot Fuzz marks the second movie from the guys that gave us Shaun of The Dead, a fun romatic-comedy-zombie movie.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz is a story a story of Nick Angel, a great London cop who is so good he is sent to a sleepy little country town, in witch he relises big time crime can still happen in a small town.<br /><br />The comedy in Hot Fuzz is to take every movie clice and put them in a movie, not as a parody, but to simply take notice of them.  A long montage of quick cuts show Nick processing paperwork, for example.  The movie is fun and full of energy.  Nick Frost and Simon Pegg do a great job and provide the movie with the right amount of charm to the screen.<br /><br />The DVD does a good job in the audio and picture quality.  The bouns features get the job done but aren't as extensive as most DVDs now released.<br /><br />Overall if you enjoy comidies and/or action movies you'll find some enjoyment in this picture.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|A wonderful movie about a child, her mom and Santa Claus, yes I still believe.
B000ROALCG|4.0|When I heard this album, I expected for Marc Anthony to adapt to Hector Lavoe's style to interpret the songs, not just imitate his voice (UJUM!, Van Lester)!!! and anyone else that can a buck only as a Hector Lavoe imitator or Hector Lavoe \\"covers\\" orquestras.  And I think Marc Anthony accomplished that without using completely his vocal range.  Remember, Hector Lavoe was not known for that, but more the way he spills his emotions and interacts with his public with his phrases on stage.  The songs chosen are some of the obvious popular tunes, some that are not really the most popular tunes from his catalog.  I guess that might depend where you lived in that era, PR, NYC, South America, the favorites vary slightly by market or area.  I have not seen the movie yet, but I imagine the reason these songs were chosen for this sountrack is because it fit the best with the \\"movie's standpoint\\" of Hector Lavoe's live.  You can't compare salsa quality from the Fania era, that is something that is locked and treasured, but I think for 2007 this album is done musically very good. It's a well done album with a great musical quality in today's standards, (stop comparing with the Fania era, that was the  sacred time golden age of salsa and is never coming back). I recommend highly this album.  The main reason I gave this album four stars is the last song, by Jennifer Lopez, it is very out of place from the other songs

B000006O7C|1.0|As the title states, these were sketches for an album which was never made due to Jeff's accidental drowning. These are VERY ROUGH sketches. According to those who knew him, these sketches were nowhere near the state Jeff would have wanted them to be recorded and published. Most are incredibly unmelodic, and Jeff's voice is quite harsh and unrefined on the majority. Despite loving Grace and Live at Sin-E, I found this music very difficult to listen to and with very little worth remembering.  It actually tarnishes my image of Jeff.
B00005JPQR|5.0|I loved this movie! Finally a smart action film in a summer of mindless destruction. Don't get me wrong, I liked Transformers and Pirates 3, but this was a nice change. Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, period. The shaky camera while present isn't as big of a problem this time around. I also like how the Bourne films use very little CGI.<br /><br />A little warning though. More than half the film is a prequel to the end of The Bourne Supremacy (the call between Pamela and Bourne). The start of the movie takes place after the car chase in the last movie and continues until Bourne call Pamela Landy and says, \\"you look tired, get some sleep.\\" It's kind of neat how they tied it all in.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|Fincher does a fairly good job at directing this film.  The problem lies in the fact it's based on the works of Robert Gray Smith, a certified obsessive.  Gray Smith has been obsessed with, beyond factual evidence, proving that (and on book jackets claiming that \\"by the author that solved the Zodiac case\\") Arthur Lee Allen was the killer.  To prove Gray Smith's obsessiveness, towards the end of this movie Gray Smith meets a friend of a Zodiac victim in jail and starts interviewing her about the case.  While asking her about a suspect, on his many suspects in the film, Gray Smith pressures this person into confirming his preconcieved notions of the guilt of the suspect.  He yells at her, \\"Just say it! It was Rick!\\"  So take the movie with a grain of salt, and just be entertained by the fable that Gray Smith has woven.    Other than that, the soundtrack to this film is great.  The songs work really well with setting up the mood.  In addition, Fincher's cinematography is superb, especially with the opening sequence at the July 4th and the Stein Cab scene where the camera follows the cab in an almost Grand Theft Auto camera sequence/ talk radio coupling.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Through Stanley Kubrick's camera lens, the universe is a cold and frequently sinister place.<br /><br />The man-made world of DR. STRANGELOVE marches to its wacky Armaggeddon even as its silly characters struggle valiantly to save it.  The technology that got us into the outer space of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY betrays us and leaves us as nothing more than a well-fed, well-dressed specimen to the powers we find beyond our solar system.  The government of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is so bent on behavioral modification that it makes a hero of a rapist thug like Alex the Droog.  The mask covering our historical and psychological sins is ripped away and leaves us as absorbed ghosts in the Overlook Hotel in THE SHINING.  And the military of FULL METAL JACKET chews up our young men and spits them out as psycho-killers razing someone else's countryside.<br /><br />So at the end of his life, Kubrick makes a love story.  Talk about confounding everyone on the planet, including his fans.<br /><br />Kubrick died just after finishing the cut that was released to theatres and much speculation has been placed on what he would've done before anyone saw it.  There were enough wild rumors during production.  Even now, I read a story that Kubrick was disappointed with the Hollywood power couple of Cruise and Kidman.  (Although he's a very earnest actor, Cruise seems to struggle with depth, but I thought Kidman was a good choice...although she plays getting high on marijuana too silly and ridiculous--has she ever been high?).<br /><br />But something worked for me with EYES WIDE SHUT.<br /><br />And there's something new here that's never been seen in a Stanley Kubrick film before: optimism.  Even as Cruise's love for his wife is assaulted by the haunting images of her making love to the officer in uniform, even as he recklessly follows paths to violate his vows and his faithfulness...something always stops him.  He doesn't ravage the hooker, he doesn't indulge in the bizarre private orgy, etc.<br /><br />Something always brings him home, safe and sound.  Something you never saw in the Kubrick film before.<br /><br />(When will they release a version without the computer-generated orgy attendees blocking our view?)afe and sound.  Something you never saw in the Kubrick film before.    (When will they release a version without the computer-generated orgy attendees blocking our view?)
B00005JPQT|2.0|... DH 1-2-3, I think this one will appeal only to those who regard TV crap as entertainment, and video games as the 'nec plus ultra' for what does not any longer deserves to be named \\"civilization\\". As well, the director's name must have been very badly mispelled, since it should not be \\"Len Wiseman\\", but \\"Loose Dumbkid\\". And, since they must have paid Bruce Willis over the top so they could use 'Die Hard' in the title, that would explain why they were not able to have any real actor in this pretence of a movie.  Of course, all those with an IQ lower than 55 will disagree with that opinion.
B00005R8FI|5.0|I used to listen to this recording in the 70's, and today it is as good as ever. A pleasure to have it again.
0060536357|5.0|To say this book was expertly written, would be an understatement. The authors craft the perfect description of an LBO, with all the players, transactions, and affects on peples lives. How they were able to get inside as well as they did, is really beyond me. This is one for the ages and should be read in Business schools.
B000HT3P7E|4.0|I have been so burnt on much of network traditional TV and was pleasantly surprised to find a witty, well written, well acted, and well directed comedy featuring a stellar cast.  The characters are entertaining and it gives us a break from the horror that is most comedy programs such as Everybody Loves Raymond (blech!!!) and its million clone of copycat crappy shows about miserable marriages and families.  Kudos to CBS for airing a show about intellingent people trying to make it, not middle aged miserable people who hate their spouses and their kids (again Everybody Loves Raymond and its clones that CBS was and airing for so long...).  I have loved both seasons 1 and 2 and look forward to season 3.  This is a show I can relate to in my life as a single person in my thirties:)
0151013047|5.0|If you are not moved beyond reason by this deeply thoughtful as well as lyrical and yet concise masterpiece, I don't know what to suggest. Like cognac, it has a bite, initially quite nasty in some cases, but then it lightens and blends and then even sharpens a moment; think of all the things we have all been through over 9/11 and how absolutely enlightening it is to get a very different perspective on the whole thing. I am reading it a second time and finding that there is not an extra word in this entire book. Can't wait to go find \\"Moth Smoke.\\" I'm thinking of changing my own name to Changez. No small honor for an incrediblely dense yet light on the prose wonderful work of art. It may not last forever, as 9/11 and that precise emotional cargo this wonderful book speaks to, will be limited to those present at that specific moment, in the same way that the assasination of JFK will always live with some of us, as a before and after division in our lives. But this book speaks to so much more about how little we understand the world that we at times think we are qualified to rule. A delectable presentation of all of these issues, written in a superb manner. Devastating, to say the least.
0316067598|5.0|Outstanding!

B0002EXH5O|1.0|Rust in peace has been in my favorite top five of all metal albums since I first heard it back when it first came out.  I;ve replaced this album three times already and was excited to see that they finally had a remastered version.  My excitement very shortly turned to disgust.  After listening to this album I once called a masterpiece for the last seventeen years, hearing the rerecorded vocals (and possibly even some of the bass and drums) was agonizing.  Dave Mustaine, in my opinion ruined the best thing he ever accomplished.  My copy of this cd quickly became a frisbee.  I suppose now if I want the original version, I'll have to settle with a used copy.  Shame on you Dave Mustaine.
1582701709|3.0|I have a mixed review on the concept of \\"The Secret.\\"  Overall, this little book will be very effective for those who persist in their daily lives with negative attitudes.  However, people like myself who use an optimistic approach to life may not find this book very helpful.  It can be a good reminder for everyone to approach life and situations with positive thoughts (energy).
B00003CX9E|1.0|I bought this expecting to see the movie \\"Citizen Kane\\" however, when it arrived in the mail it was not a movie. It came in a weird box that was not like a movie and when I opened it there were two CDs inside. Normally when you buy movies they have a large tape inside that you put into a VCR. I put the CDs into my VCR but they didn't do anything, the machine just made a weird sound. So then I tried putting them into it one at a time but the same thing happened. I even tried rewinding it but nothing happened. I thought maybe it was just the music from the movie, but I don't have a CD player so I can't find out. The box says that it is a movie but it does not include instructions for using the movie or how to make it work. I just wanted to see a movie, I didn't ask for all of this!
B000ION79Y|5.0|I am truly awed by this monumental piece of work. It smacks of something Shakespeare or Ed Woods would have given breath to.

B000F1IQNM|3.0|This was a fun movie for the family.  lots of action for kids and good humor for adults.
0743277708|5.0|This is a story about totally ordinary rabbits.  For all we know, all rabbits may act like these when confronted with difficult situations, only we have not noticed.  Maybe they travel in slightly bigger groups and are slightly more fearless than we're used to seeing, but there's nothing that differentiates these rabbits from those that live in your backyard.  This story takes place in a totally ordinary setting in the author's part of rural England.  The imaginative part of this novel is how the various rabbit characters interact during their exodus from their native warren until they find a new home.    The prophecy of Fiver, the resourcefulness of Hazel, the strength of Bigwig, these are the characteristics that keep the Sandleford rabbits moving even as they encounter enemies in the form of dogs, foxes, men, and the dreaded automobile.  The name of the legendary patriarch of all rabbits \\"El-ahrairah\\" says it all - in Lapine, it means \\"he of a thousand enemies.\\"  During their journey, the rabbits tell stories of his cunning to keep themselves and the reader entertained.    This book is for everyone.  Its insights on trust, friendship, and community are priceless.  It is filled with adventure, suspense, ingenuity, and humor.  Rabbit behavior is true to nature, according to R. M. Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit.  The reading level is not complicated, and there is a glossary for those of us who don't speak Lapine.  Highly recommended.
0761944524|5.0|In my job, I often train others how to use SPSS. This book comes up in conversation a lot. It is outstanding. I have come to the conclusion that if a serious user of SPSS's statistical features is to get only one reference; this is it. Something I have noticed is that when I meet someone that has spent time with the book, the are invariably quite good at SPSS. Even if they may not have mastered all the techniques in this large book, they know their stuff.<br /><br />The Pallant book [[ASIN:0335216404 SPSS Survival Manual]], which I have also reviewed, is designed to help survive a first course (and presumably last) in basic statistics. The Field book, however, could be revisited again and again, each time reaching a deeper understanding.<br /><br />I already know the statistics in this book well, so I can't claim that this book has taught me the basics, but it simultaneously covers all the major topics of interest while keeping it as simple as possible. I wish it had existed earlier in my career. The main advantage to users of SPSS is that all of the examples are SPSS examples. However, make no mistake, this is a serious introduction to statistics, not merely a point and click guide. It is not current with version 15.0, but I don't think this is a major strike against it, given the excellent review of theory. If, however, you really need to keep up on the current features like I do, you will want to consider books in addition this one. Consider one or more of the three Norusis books depending on your level and needs.
630218021X|3.0|If you watch 1970's \\"Music Lovers\\", Ken Russell's badly misinformed portrait of the life of Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, you may think people were as open about homosexuality in the 1870s and they were starting to become in the 1970s. Europeans have always been more open and accepting of lifestyle than Americans, but this film treatment still borders on the ridiculous.<br /><br />The subject of Russell's dissertation, Tchaikovsky, was one of the half-dozen greatest classical music composers in history. He remains the greatest architect of ballet among all composers with \\"Swan Lake\\" -- some scenes of which are delightfully reenacted in this film -- holding steadfast to its reputation as the greatest of all ballet. Tchaikovsky also wrote six symphonies, three piano concertos, three operas that remain in the standard repertory, a violin concerto and the late romantic era's most endearing and beloved orchestral music on subjects ranging from Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Francesa da Rimini) to travelogue (Capriccio Italian) to history (1812 Overture, March Slav).<br /><br />Tchaikovsky, who died age 53 after composing his dynamic and depressing Symphony No. 6, was homosexual and was tormented by his homosexuality, which is the aspect of his life this film exploits. A remarkable early scene, where actor Ricahrd Chamberlain, playing Tchaikovsky, premieres his magnificent Piano Concerto No. 1 to the conservatory, is followed almost immediately by a scene of the composer in bed with a boyfriend. This is the exploitative nature of the film, which merges sensationalism with incorrect history to give viewers an incorrect thumbprint of the composer.<br /><br />Just as [[ASIN:6304712936 Amadeus]] did not always accurately reflect Mozart and the abominable [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]] was essentially 100 percent wrong in its portrayal of Ludwig van Beethoven, so too does \\"Music Lovers\\" poorly portray the life and times of Tchaikovsy. However, the two musical scenes provide insight for novices into the range of expression the composer offered and the piano concerto's first movement is played in its entirety.<br /><br />Fortunately, a subsequent films about Beethoven -- [[ASIN:B000936H7S Beethoven - Eroica]] -- is somewhat frivolous but casts the composer in better film treatment than the earlier travesty. In addition, the PBS film [[ASIN:B00005UJYA Impromptu]] was very accurate in its depiction of composer Fredric Chopin and Franz Liszt, writer George Sand and French revolutionary artist Eugene Delacroix.<br /><br />For this reason, there is hope that one day Tchaikovsky will be represented on the silver screen more appropriatley. Until that day arrives, this is it. Enjoy the music but beware the hype and sexual manipulation.the range of expression the composer offered and the piano concerto's first movement is played in its entirety.

067101756X|5.0|You might have read any of the multitude of books and seen any of the dozens of cable TV specials perporting to present you with the most accurate account of the July 1947 events in New Mexico. Virtually all of them have been written and/or produced by a variety of persons who approached the subject from an outside investigator's point of view.  But that is exactly what makes this amazing book so unique. Indeed, it was written by a man so highly credible as a person of impeccable standing and as one of those who would doubtlessly know the facts behind the legend, that those who remain adamantly fantatical in their disbelief of the events described in great detail herein after reading this man's testimony are left to comfort themselves with the imagined thought that he must surely have been only joking.
B00000E2VC|5.0|One of the most distinguished pianists of the XX century, Benedetti Michelangeli' s contribution for enhancing the music of Chopin, restored it that coveted majesty and aristocratic &eacute;clat, endowed of sentiment, not sentimentality so typical of the late Romanticism, he added the required doses of sheer lingering between two notes to make the sound floated and so to link with the next bar, that orchestral approach nourished and enriched the nocturnal visions of the original conception of the Romanticism, in which the sense of the unexpected, diffuse temporality and unreality elevated the labeled opinions of critics and audiences accustomed through five generations to listen a mournful and afflicted Chopin, showing us on the contrary, that glorious poetry nestled bellow the score.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I don't know why it took so long for me to figure out he is my favorite Beatle. He lived in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney, but produced some of the Fab Four's most enduring material. After the breakup, he continued to grow both spiritually and creatively, and this concert supplies a rewarding retrospective of his work from Beatle to Wilbury, with Bangladesh in between. For some, the performances of celebrities who honor him (Eric Clapton leads the band) will be reason enough to buy the DVD [[ASIN:B0000CEB4V A Concert for George]], but it's George's music that shines through, and it is played with joy, reverance, and an ear for the sound of the original recordings. I liked the concert so much I had to have the CD so I could listen in the car! George may have gone, but he left us an incredible body of work and a son who looks just like him!
0061142026|4.0|Stardust is a delightful little story of a boy who, in order to win the hand of the girl he loves, goes on a quest to recover a fallen star.  He's promised the girl that he will return with the particular star they saw together to prove his love, and she promises his heart's desire if he returns with the item.  Seems like a fairly straightforward task, right?  Of course it's not!  Because the star has fallen into Faerie, the land beyond the gap in the wall of the town of Wall, and no one's gone through the gap except for the fair that comes to town every nine years.  Undaunted, however, Tristran resolutely goes through on his quest into the strange land where gnomes, little hairy men, witches, talking trees, and who knows what else lives.<br /><br />Gaiman has given this tale lots of twists and turns. It doesn't take long for Tristran to discover that he's not the only one looking for the fallen star; the would-be rulers of Stormhold need it to recognize which brother will inherit the kingdom, and a trio of witchly sisters covet the star in order to return themselves to their former youth and beauty.  Tristran, whose own parentage seems to indicate he's from Faerie as well, is mightily surprised when he discovers what the fallen star actually is, and he finds himself outwitted and forlorn in his journey to return to Wall to capture his love's heart.  Along the way he encounters and battles some strange creatures, and discovers that maybe what he desires most isn't what he thought it was.<br /><br />This is a short book, and it really could have used a bit more fleshing out at times.  Tristran is an engaging character, if a bit naive, and the other creatures he encounters are imaginative, often behaving in the least expected ways.  The best part is the ending, when Gaiman gives us some very surprising, smile-inducing twists.  Recommended!
B0002I831S|5.0|After having watched Enterprise (Season 4) and The Next Generation (Season 5 - their best season), I have reached one inescapable conculsion.  The Original Five-Year Mission, helmed by Captain James T. Kirk, is by far the best.  The first season is full of gems, the worst of which is better than the best 1st-season show in ST:TNG.  The Original Series takes a lot of heat: deadline issues created William Shatner's stilted delivery (\\"It bought me time to remember the next line!\\") and budget issues led to some very cheesy (even for the late '60s) effects.  But the stories themselves, and the interaction between the Big Three of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy raised the level of the show to levels seldom achieved before or since.  One might question the need to release these shows on DVD - after all, they seem to be on in syndication constantly!  But the clarity and completeness of the shows, not to mention the lack of advertisements (they run 10 minutes longer than a conventional hour-long drama, and are often trimmed in syndication), is reason enough for me to pick up this set.    These shows have a timeless quality, because the writing is often a metaphor for the human condition in general.  Often written by the top science fiction (and in the case of Robert Bloch, horror) writers of the day, the actors are given a wide range of emotions and interactions: with the regular cast, with the guest stars, even with blocks of latex masquarading as aliens and robots.  The actors have been panned in later years as being hams - especially Shatner - but such an opinion does not bear close scrutiny when watching these shows.  These are actors at the top of their games (especially when compared other performances of the '60s).  Interestingly, these shows are presented in order of broadcast (not in order of production, as they are always shown in syndication).  This leads to some bizarre anachronisms in the early episodes.  Sulu, for example, has three positions (helmsman, botanist, and physicist), and Uhura's costume changes back and forth between yellow and red several times (and occasionally a black belt appears for no apparent reason).  That said, it's amazing how fast the cast and writers come together - by the time of The Naked Time - the 4th show broadcast - the main characters are fully developed.  This didn't really take place in TNG until Season 3!    Instead of listing the episodes in order, as other episode lists do, I've decided to arrange them by importance/enjoyability.  The episodes of Season 1 are (order of broadcast in parentheses:    Super-Fantastic Episodes:    Where No Man Has Gone Before (3) - The second pilot develops some real tension between the crew members as Kirk must act to save his crew at the expense of his best friend.    The Naked Time (4) - a virus causes members of the crew to lose all inhibitions, so we learn that Spock finds it difficult to hide his emotions, that Kirk finds the Enterprise to be a substitute for a real woman, etc.    Balance of Terror (14) - The Romulans have a new weapon and a new cloaking device, which they are testing on the Federation's outposts.  Kirk and the Romulan engage in a battle akin to a destroyer-submarine conflict in WWII.    The Devil in the Dark (25) - Kirk must find and destroy a creature that is killing miners on a very valuable mining colony.    The City on the Edge of Forever (28) - Often voted the Best episode of the series.  McCoy mistakingly changes history when an accident sends him through the time portal called the Guardian of Forever.  Kirk and Spock follow him back to the 1930s to try to repair the damage.  Guest stars a young Joan Collins.    Very Good Episodes:    What are Little Girls Made Of? (7) - A showcase for Majel Barret as Nurse Chapel, in which she and Kirk are pitted against her ex-fiance as he tries to force his idea of utopia onto the human race.    The Menagerie (11 & 12) - the only 2-parter in TOS, using footage from the Cage pilot.  Spock hijacks theEnterprise and kidnaps his former captain.  During the court martial, we find out why in flashbacks.    The Galileo 7 (16) - Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and a few others crash-land on a planet in the middle of a nebula.  A great story marred only slightly by the seemingly artificial attacks of McCoy and others on Spock's leadership.    Arena (18) - Kirk and an enemy captain are forced into single combat by Superbeings into whose space their battle strays.  One of the few ideas the Next Generation series did better (in \\"Darmok\\"), but this is still a very good episode.    Space Seed (22) - the first part of what turned out to be a 4-part arc (this show, plus films 2, 3, and 4).  Ricardo Montalban guest-stars as the genetically enhanced Khan, exiled from Earth, who tries to take over the Enterprise to reinvoke his rule on humanity.    Errand of Mercy (25) - the first appearance of Klingons, as the Enterprise and the Klingon war fleet battle for control of a strategic planet.  The natives of the planet seem strangely indifferent to their plight, however....    Episodes to which I am fairly indifferent, but enjoy when I see them:    The Man Trap (1) - the first episode, suffers from poor development of the Salt Vampire monster, although there is a nice debate about the morality of committing xenocide even to save oneself.    The Enemy Within (5) - covers much the same arc as \\"Naked Time\\" but only Kirk is involved, as he is split into an intellectual half and an emotional half.    Mudd's Women (6) - Harry Mudd, interstellar con artist, is transporting women using an illegal drug to make them irresistable to men.    Dagger of the Mind (9) - Kirk is taken hostage by an insane doctor in a mental hospital, who is illegally using a machine to wipe out the minds of his inmates.    The Corbomite Maneuver (10) - the Enterprise is caught in a standoff with another ship while exploring a new region of space.  Notable as an early example of Kirk talking his way out of trouble instead of shooting his way out.    Shore Leave (15) - A neat idea but not a very credible delivery.  The Enterprise comes across a planet where thoughts become reality, sometimes to deadly effect.    The Squire of Gothos (17) - One of the first Superbeings encountered by the Enterprise.    Tomorrow is Yesterday (19) - An encounter with a black hole throws the Enterprise back in time, where they inadvertantly change the past.  They must correct the error before they can return to their own time.    Court Martial (20) - Quite enjoyable for the most part, if contrived.  The ending spoils it somewhat - surely there is an easier way to prove Kirk's innocence than evacuating the entire ship?    Return of the Archons (21) - Notable as the first instance of Kirk talking a computer to death.    A Taste of Armageddon (23) - A pair of planets is engaged in a sanitised, 800-year-old war, and the Enterprise is listed as a casualty, and is expected to voluntarily destroy itself.  Kirk intervenes to put an end to the society that allows the war to continue.    This Side of Paradise (24) - A spore infection causes the entire crew of the Enterprise to choose a utopian sloth over a life of progress that contains danger and struggle.    Operation: Annihilate! (29) - A madness-inducing parasitic organism threatens to spread through the galaxy, destroying humanity, unless Kirk can stop it.    Episodes I wouldn't watch if they happened to be on in syndication:    Charlie X (2) - only \\"The Changling\\" is a worse TOS show.    Miri (8) - again, much of the same material (the tension between Kirk and Rand) is covered in \\"Naked Time\\", and the rest isn't really that interesting.    The Conscience of the King (13) - an ambitious Shakespearean episode that just doesn't come together for me.  Kirk and Lt. Reilly are the last two living witnesses of a massacre when they were children.  Kirk suspects a Shakespearean actor is the man who ordered the massacre, but can't act without proof.    The Alternative Factor (27) - A madman and his alternate-universe doppleganger battle between two universes, when a meeting in one universe of the two of them would spell its complete destruction.
B000002UAX|5.0|THE WHITE ALBUM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BEATLES ALBUMS INDEED. IT CERTAINLY RANKS AS THE GREATEST OF ALL OF ROCK DOUBLE ALBUMS EVER RELEASED!! THERE IS NO DOUBLE ALBUM SET WITH AS GREATLY VARIED SONG TYPES AND UNIVERSAL MUSICIANSHIP THAT ANY ONE WILL FIND!!! THOUGH ALL OF THEM ARE PARTICIPATING IN EACH OTHER'S SONGS, WITH TECHNICALLY LESS COHESION THAN THEIR EARLIER ALBUMS, THE GROUP EFFORT ENHANCES EACH SONG STILL MORE THAN WHAT ANY OTHER GROUP COULD HAVE ACHIEVED UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. LACK OF COHESION AND EMERGENCE OF TENSION WITHIN THE GROUP SOMEHOW WORKED IN SOME RARE WAY TO SHOWCASE EACH ONE'S TALENT AND OUTPUT IN AN ENHANCED WAY WHICH MADE THIS A VERY SPECIAL BEATLES (DOUBLE)ALBUM INDEED! GEORGE'S 'WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS', LONG,LONG,LONG' ARE TWO OF MY GREAT FAVORITES. THE ALBUM IS FULL OF REVELATIONS, PEARLS, POETICS, SHEER HARD ROCK, BLUES, HUMOR, FOLK STUFF, OLDER STYLES, EXPERIMENTAL EXCURSIONS, SATIRE, PHILOSOPHY, LOVE, POLITICS, PSYCHEDELIC INFLUENCE, RAW EMOTIONS, LAMENTATION, POP, ROCK AND ROLL, AND ALL THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE ON THE MUSICAL HORIZON!! NO OTHER BAND COULD HAVE MADE SUCH AN ALBUM OF SUCH WIDE-RANGING ARTISTRY AND VISION. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT: THE GREATEST MUSICAL GROUP MAKES THE GREATEST OF ALL DOUBLE ALBUMS EVER RELEASED... A CONCURRENCE EVEN HARDER TO ACHIEVE!
B00001OH7P|1.0|Vulgar and unpleasant album from the tiresome Bowie in his alien-comes-down-to-Earth-as-a-rock-star guise.<br />Why he NEEDS alter-ego's at all is a mystery, perhaps it's to fool us into thinking he's more interesting than he actually is, or not blame him when things are wrong. Some hope.<br /><br />Anyway, 'TRAFOZSATSFM' is a dreary, humourless excursion. Dull as dishwater with a subtle-as-concrete premise; Messianic traveler descends, and is distraught to find our civilization is on it's last legs. We're all to blame, and we're about to take the last ride on self-destruction highway.<br />Fair enough - so what's he gonna do about it?<br /><br />Well, he's going to play some of the coarsest, stupidest, badly dated songs you can think of, in ludicrous make-up and a clown costume. The planet's saved! Go Ziggy!!<br /><br />I suppose what really irks me here, is the fact that this is almost reverentially over-praised, with little or no dissention - no sane voice of reason pulling it up, and having a second look.<br />It's accepted-as-fact that it's a work of unencroachable genius, despite the fact it's got no guts or soul, or anything that would make you warm to it. Anything that makes you remember it fondly, mark a time in your life by it.<br /><br />I can already hear the screams of outrage and disbelief as this 'great work' is dismantled (and that's the easy bit, a slight glance past the hyperbole and it falls apart), but I kid you not; this is some of the most clapped out, weary music that exists in the world - and in that sense, it's no wonder Bowie needs to hide behind a 'persona' to present it.<br /><br />Despite all the bombast and show, Ziggy's not that interesting (either!), it's as if someone's decided to construct him loosely, in the shadow of Bowie's own psyche, of a perception. And he's delighted to go along with it, myth establishing and ego massaging as he goes.<br />Cue that false, aloof, but-not-so-aloof-that-you-don't-buy-my-records, grin.<br /><br />Concepts like this should be done with a flourish, with a smile, with a lightness of touch. Laugh-a-minute-Dave uses a mallet.<br /><br />He should prefix the closing (excruciating!) 'Rock n Roll Suicide' with a Mike Yarwood style: \\"and this is me\\", just to reassure us; let us know it's just a lark, a druggie blast, and not to take it too seriously.<br /><br />No chance. Deadly Duke Dave plays this severe grey charade to a grim death, and that's why the album dies one.mile, with a lightness of touch. Laugh-a-minute-Dave uses a mallet.    He should prefix the closing (excruciating!)

B000RJO578|5.0|I am a Brit living in the US and where I live they never showed Shaun of the Dead at the cinema.  Thankfully HOT FUZZ did show here.  It was literally a laugh a minute and I probably laughed more because I \\"get\\" the humour.  I know people who have seen this and Shaun of the Dead and didn't find them funny at all.  I am not knocking them, but not everyone \\"gets\\" British humour.  I thought this was funnier than \\"Shaun\\", but that still cracks me up after numerous viewings. In reality of course, there is no Sandford in Gloucestershire (where I used to live).  This was all filmed around the Wells, in Somerset, about 70 miles south.  Timothy Dalton was great as the villain (and Somefield is a real Supermarket chain over there by the way). The ending or should I say endings, was brilliant.  It seemed like the movie would end then something else would happen.  This is not just the funniest film of the year, but the funniest ever, with great comic timing, great stars and cameos (yes it is Cate Blanchett), and the hilarious Bill Bailey (who I'd like to see crop up in more movies).  Can't wait to see what they will take on next.
B000UDJS2S|4.0|Comic book movies are always touch and go.  They could be great (X-men, Batman, Spiderman, Hellboy, V For Vendetta), they could be awful (Hulk, Skycaptain, Judge Dredd, Ultraviolet).  This one gave me what I wanted out of it and adequately told the story of the Ghost Rider, though I never really followed the comic that much, so if there are plot holes I wouldn't know about them.  Basically, Nicolas Cage makes this movie.  The man is a great actor and can turn S*** into gold (with the exception of the unsalvageable Wickerman).  In this case the story is well-written though most of the other actors are B-rated.  The girl/love interest Eva Mendes, can barely act, though has nice bouncy breasts and therefore satisfies as eye candy, but little more.  Overall, a successful and enjoyable movie.
B000ROALCG|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am one of those hardcore Hector Lavoe fanatics that gets up to dance every time any one of Lavoe's songs starts playing - be it in a restaurant, a nightclub, \\"la calle\\", you name it...    Hector Lavoe had an undeniable talent captivating the audiences with not only his voice, but his personal style back in the 70's and early 80's... Let's face it, there will never be music like Lavoe's (which is also true for all the other big \\"Salsa Gorda\\" Soneros - e.g. Tito Rodriguez, Ismael Rivera, Tito Puente, just to mention a few) - Even though I believe Mark Anthony did a great job acting in Hector's capacity (I realized this after seeing the film), Hector's music is still unparalleled today and always will be (which should not be unexpected). Objectively speaking, these songs make more sense in the movie than they do when put together as a standalone compact-disc.  For my everyday listening and dancing leisure, I would much rather enjoy the unadulterated Lavoe's originals (which I do not think is particularly unexpected).    What I really expected from Mark Anthony was for him to incorporate some of his own flavor into this production. Mark Anthony is gifted in his own ways, and he should have allowed for this album to stand-out by being a little bit more like himself. Should he have done this, we would have ended up with one of the best salsa CD's ever - After all, this was a great opportunity for Mark to interpret, and not just imitate, during the remaking of some of yesterday's most-treasured salsa classics while concurrently allowing himself to reach today's \\"newer\\" salsa crowds... And as far as us consumers go - Why buy a less-than-perfect replica, when you can listen to the crème de la crème - which has stood the test of time?    Overall, this CD lacks originality and since Mark's intentions were to mirror Lavoe verbatim, I should write my evaluation with that in mind... And no, there is no Mark Lavoe.
B000P0J02E|5.0|This soundtrack is excellent all the way through.  With more variety than the first one...and I dont even want to mention the second one...it has graced my CD player more than any CD in the months since I bought it.  The music is well performed, well written, and well put togehter.  Each song seems to complement the next.  Overall, one of the best CDs I have ever purchased
B00008BRB5|5.0|Just back from the concert reunion in Chicago and had to re-new my love for this band by running out and getting some DVDs. Synchronicity is simply put, awwwwwsome! I agree with some of the other posts, why have the back-up singers featured so much? I saw the Police in the 80s in Chicago with a bunch of High School friends, not sure if they were there to pick up chicks and get hammered or watch the show? Never-the-less if your a fan, put this in your DVD collection. I also picked several other Police DVDs and can't wait to play the air drums when the wife and kids are out at Chucky Cheeses! LOL

B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother, Where Art thou is a dark comedy imbued with shades of the mystical.  Based on \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer, it is set in hard-hit Mississippi during the 1930s Depression.  Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), desperate to get back to his wife and family, escapes from a Parchman chain gang with cantankerous Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, clueless Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and begins the long and arduous journey back home.  Along the way, the three adventurers meet a host of interesting characters, including George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson and, with a bow to \\"The Odyssey,\\" three beautiful Sirens, a blind prophet and the Cyclops (John Goodman).  They join forces with Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who is reputed to have sold his soul to the devil for musical fame, and manage to save him from a Klan lynching.<br /><br />George Clooney is perfect for the lead and John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are wonderful in their supporting roles.  In fact, the entire cast turns in outstanding performances.<br /><br />The Coens describe the film as a \\"Ma and Pa Kettle film with high production values,\\" and that is certainly true.  The settings are true to the period and the artistic filming is in tint similar to the photography of the day.  Like photos from an old family album, scenes bring a touch of nostalgia for a way of life forever gone.<br /><br />The folk, bluegrass and spiritual music are perfect for this story and add authenticity to the tale.  In the film, Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and King, calling themselves the \\"Soggy Bottom Boys,\\" cut a record entitled \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" to earn money.  Clooney lip-syncs the song, which is actually sung by Dan Tyminski.  Tim Blake Nelson himself performs the song \\"He's in the Jailhouse Now,\\" also in the film.  The Soggy Bottom Boys' guitar accompanist, Chris Thomas King, who also performs the Skip James' blues song, \\"Killin' Floor Blues,\\" is an accomplished blues musician and recording artist in his own right.<br /><br />The writers obviously did their research well.  The Southern politics and methods of campaigning, the Appalachian folk music and Delta blues, and the country customs, the dialog and expressions are right on target.  This film tells a story that is far more than just a comedy.  As a life-long resident of Mississippi, I found it touched me on so many levels.  The baptismal scene was awe-inspiring, the Klan meeting chilling.  The film encompassed everything I both love and hate about my great home state.  Even in its most comedic moments, it whispered truths.<br /><br />O Brother, Where Art Thou garnered two 2002 Academy Award nominations:  Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen) and Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins).  For his work in the film, George Clooney received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.<br /><br />Brilliantly produced and directed, from the cast to the script and the setting, this movie is as good as it gets.

B000R9J3X4|5.0|This album encapsules 12 years of the band, and they are not done yet according to recent interviews with Butch and Shirley.  The best part about this album is that it is remastered, so listen carefully and you will discover sounds you never heard before. This collection is essential for any garbage fan, especially the remix CD which puts a good spin on the originals.  This greatest hits collection is a good start for anyone who likes the band, but Garbage is best known for their albums as a whole, so while this takes you down memory lane, make sure to buy their albums if you haven't already for the real journey.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Well, it is better than \\"Hi Ho!\\" [different meaning today .....]<br />HOWEVER, what a BEAUTIFUL movie, minimal, graphic [yes] but in a sytalized way, and quite a love story.<br /><br />Wonder how Pasolini would have handled this, but that's delving into realism, this one's pure fantasy, pity obout the accents though?<br /><br />HENERY:  What about the chorus line?<br /><br />Well, the accents were a bit confusing, considering they - most of them especially Gerald Butler [yumO!] sounded like Seam Connery, \\"Leonidas, Leonidas-Leonidas, but you can call me Leonidas\\", and \\"sire' [as in fire] confused with 'sir\\" as in \\"her\\".<br /><br />The Queen?  Very much a Joan Crawford role in her early career, would LOVE to see more of this Lady.<br /><br />HENERY:  ...but what about the Can-Can?<br /><br />As for Xerces ~ where's the feathered head-dress?  Rodrigo Santoro does a fine job, although the make up is awful[ly] like Steve Boyd's Nimrod in \\"The Bible, in the beginning .....\\"; touch of Gina Lollobrigida, more than a hint of Anita Ekberg in 'Bocaccio '70;  and the piercings - YIKES!<br /><br />and ...<br /><br />Yes, Herery one could retitle this \\"Follies Begere vs The Moulin Rouge\\" -those gams are great, but it's also a story about great heroism ...<br /><br />HENERY:  Heroism?  My eye [the one that can still see] - they were a little upstart, macho,  state along the lines of Hitler's Gernary and considered themselves a superior race!<br /><br />Henery - shut up!  They were very nice, Greekmmm err Spartan boys - fotunately, now all of them over there are much more focused on soccer...<br /><br />HENERY:  BUT wasn't the soccer ball originally your enemy's head!<br />,,, and what about Xerces 'making eyes' at Leo???  Slightly impossible considering big \\"X\\" is over 9 drachma tall!<br /><br />Henery!  Behave or no baklava for desert !<br /><br />[Folks, also check out SIN CITY - great companion piece to this saga!]<br /><br />Henery:  Now, where's Kirk Douglas when we need him???<br /><br />wonder if enlistment is going up - as for the much needed pedicures..... wasn't anyone looking - at least they bikini-waxed!st they bikini-waxed!

B000001E3L|5.0|Catch Van at his best, in this stunning live concert that demonstrates conclusively why he is so highly regarded by music fans.  As he shouts at the end...\\"Is this band hot ?\\"...and it is.  A sparkling series of performances that put other live albums to shame, and that you will listen to over and over again. Hard to get, but worth the wait if you order, this album will be a treasure to visit again and again.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|The visual impact of this series in full high-definition is simply amazing.  My wife and kids are equally enthralled; when teenagers request that we watch a nature documentary, you know it has to be really, really good.  My personal opinion is that this series shouldn't even be shown in standard-definition; many of the scenes (particularly the wide-angle aerial shots) require the fine detail of HD DVD to be of value.      It's nice to see the special effects of the usual guns'n'bombs'n'cars movies in 1080p, but this series takes full advantage of the medium and uses it for something worth seeing more than once.    [A note to potential purchasers: if you're not certain whether or not you have a HD DVD player, you probably don't.  This HD DVD series requires a true HD DVD player, not an upconverting DVD player.  They are not the same thing; HD DVD is far more advanced, but many of the HD DVD discs will not play in the 'old-style' DVD players.]
B000ICL3KG|5.0|To be honest, I have been a big fan of Al Gore since the book \\"Earth in the Balance.\\" Indeed, this DVD is a lecture that might put someone to sleep, however, it is much too important to miss it! It is informative and hopefully will lead to change.<br /><br />Mr. Gore may be the speaker, but since \\"Earth in the Balance\\" I have known Mr. Gore to speak \\"on behalf of\\" the greatest scientific minds ever - not just on his own. He is passionate about the cause, but more importantly, he had very very intelligent people on his side.<br /><br />So no matter how you feel about Al Gore, at least think about the message of the scientists he brings together in this important documentary
0316067598|5.0|Having worked with and known Marcus for a while now, this book is pleasing to see that the truth about such fragile matters has been told by someone who is most concerned about the things that really matter.  The great men who have passed, the great men who continue to serve, and the great number of people who support those who serve.  This book will open your eyes, and will most importantly give you the honest truth, from the most honest of men I have known.  God bless the Teams!
1594489505|5.0|I had already read THE KITE RUNNER and loved it.  That book was so powerful that I expected A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS to be weaker.  SUNS was awsome...splendid as a matter of fact.  Khaled Hosseini has the ability to expose his characters souls and lives and connect them to the readers soul and life.  His characters are of a culture drastically different from our own.  Still you connect and understand and empathize.  Maybe we are all just people after all.
B000I2J2WM|5.0|No matter what you think of the plot and/or acting, this is without a doubt some of the best racing footage ever captured on film.  I race an open-wheel car on the weekends, and I have to say that this is the only film I have ever seen that comes close to capturing the experience.  Add to that the outstanding transfer to HD DVD, and it is just plain stunning.  Grand Prix is also a great demo for an HD display.
0061122416|5.0|Presented as a story/fable, I am going to venture to say that I think this book contains the secrets to life. Maybe not all of them, because, how would we know? -But you can learn a lot from reading this book. The nice thing is that it is written in a way that people of different ages can read this and understand the point. I just don't get why some people think that something worthwhile or important must be complicated? I think it's the usually the other way around. This is similar to the way fairytales work in that it speaks to your subconcious and plants seeds in your mind of the way the world works. Like Jesus and the parables. Same principal. Among the many bits of wisdom throughout the book, the major theme is the shepherd boy trying to realize his Personal Legend.<br /><br />I find the story quite enjoyable and interesting. This is one of those books that you need to have in your collection and reread it, like once a year or so. The great thing about books like this is that usually each time you read it, something different pops out at you.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite books by an author who has an awesome gift of storytelling. I remember reading a quote from a different book, that I think describes the author's writing perfectly: It was a quote from 'The Millionaire's Secrets, Life's Lessons in Wisdom & Wealth' that goes like this: \\"What you write has to reveal what is great about humanity. You have to show how people can attain their own greatness, how they can regain their lost nobility...\\" -This is something that I think Paulo Coelho has achieved marvelously.<br /><br />Now, the nice thing about this particular edition is, if you look in the lower right hand corner of the cover, you'll see that it says - \\"Plus insights, interviews & more\\" -Which is so cool because you get an idea of what the author was trying to convey, along with some other goodies about the author and the story.
0618680004|3.0|Debate between religion and science is doomed from the outset because they come from two different domains: one from within (religion) and one from without (science). Therefore, Dawkins falls into a trap when he scurrilously condemns religion for scientific reasons.

B00005JPQT|5.0|This movie was like going to your regular restaurant and ordering your favorite meal and the waiter brings it to you with presentation, quality and taste exactly as you expected it to be.  I was not disappointed with 'Live Free or Die Hard'.  It was action, action and more high impact action and John McClane is right up front dishing it out with villians worthy of the man.  They were hard to die and he was tenacious at getting them terminated. I enjoyed every moment, I never looked to my right or my left in that theatre, my eyes were glued to that screen.  The Justin guy was funny too. Thank you very much Bruce Willis, I like it when I get what I paid for.  This movie, I will see again on DVD but this is a movie to see on a huge screen at least the first time around.  If you enjoyed the previous Die Hard movies, then this fare was produced with you in mind! [[ASIN:1419642529 At My Father's Knee]]

Although it was not as funny as I expected it to be, there was very little laughter in the threatre even from the children.  However, it is a movie you can choose to view with your kids.  Maybe those of us in the theatre at the time were a hard audience to please or maybe too many of us left our funny bones at home.
0316067598|4.0|This is a fantastic war story. The book basically takes you through SEAL training into the battlefields of 2005 Afghanistan. I was genuinely crying as I read how these true warriors died, as millions have before them, without self-pity and with a savage ferocity. They never gave up.     I do wish that the politics were left out. The author blames the ROE for the mission's failure, and the \\"liberals\\" for the restrictive ROE, which, considering that Congress and the Presidency were both held by conservatives at the time, is a little disingenuous. He also blames the media, but why and how would the media find out the details of a covert SEAL operation? It seems like he should be blaming Rumsfeld if anyone.
B00005JODK|1.0|Hairspray seemed to have been a West side story gone foolish.  Please, were there no white fat women available to act the part of the white fat mama?  Travolta was a Travesty as John turned Joan, goodness me is this what happens when actors go into menopause?  Leave this sort of thing to Eddie Murphy who has already perfected it.  Additionally, the big deal made over overweight people during the sixties is another nonsensical flim flam.  During the sixties people were not so weight conscious as they are now.  In fact skinny people were considered unattractive.  The Travesty and his big white behind dancing on stage on TV would have been so laughable it would not even be considered.  I am not going to spend any more time on this review, suffice it to say, I wasted my time going to the theatre.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|The VCR ate my video one evening so I immediately jumped on the web to see if I could get it on DVD and of course Amazon had it! I had it in three or four days and have already watched it twice... again.  Not only does it \\"rock\\" as in a good movie, it rocks with its musical content... it you like this kind of jivey kinda music and I do.  I just pass over the language of which it has plenty and concentrate on the story-line and the actual musical content. Joe Seneca's character is cantankerous and steals the show. A fun movie... for me.
1590171993|5.0|The book takes you from Professor William Stoner's birth on a Missouri farm in 1891 to his death in 1956, describing starkly and simply the main events of his unremarkable life.  Somehow, the little triumphs and defeats add up to something palpaby greater than the sum of the parts, in the end assuming a dignity and majesty that might move the reader to tears.

B00005JPHT|5.0|The most surprising thing about Michael Moore's \\"Sicko\\" is that it holds so few surprises. HMO chiefs raking in billions in profits? Insurance companies finding any loophole or lame reason to deny coverage? US politicians deep in the pocket of Big Pharma? It is so depressingly familiar and so well-known to anyone paying the least bit of attention to what is going on in this country.<br /><br />Moore does something that the endless stream of talking heads on TV never manages to do, and that is to show the anguish of real human beings who are daily fed into the meat grinder of the American health care system. From sick parents forced to foreclose and move back with their kids, to 79-year-olds working in menial jobs to keep their health care, to young, sick moms having to lie to get their meds across the border in Canada, Moore show us the faces and tells us the stories of Americans who have been thrown under the bus by a system bent on profit, profit and more profit.<br /><br />What might have been a ridiculous \\"Moore-ish\\" stunt - bringing 9/11 heroes to Guantanamo Bay to gain the same rights as terror suspects -- actually broke in Moore's favor. Moore managed to get his charges into the Cuban health care system, where (get this!) they were cared BASED ON THEIR NEED, NOT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY! One woman who pays hundreds of dollars for inhalers in the US was sold one for 5 cents. This poor woman, much of whose income goes to treating the airway injury she received digging victims out of the Pile, burst into tears at the indignity of having been screwed so thoroughly by the health care system of the nation for which she had sacrificed so much.<br /><br />\\"Sicko\\" also takes us to Paris and to London, where Moore explodes the myths that socialized health care is so terrible. When citizens of these nations get sick, if a government-funded doctor does not come to their door, they go to the hospital where they are promptly cared for, and at no charge. That's right, not grilled to make sure they can pay and not plied with high-priced designer drugs. It's no wonder that our politicians (and many of their witless, gulled constituents who happily vote against their own self-interest) mock the French so mercilessly. Clearly, if the average American knew the fleecing they were getting, and the way they are doing nothing but enriching the super-rich, they would revolt.<br /><br />\\"Sicko\\" should be a jolt for everyone who reflexively assumes that America is best at everything. Clearly, the nation that consistently places profits before people, then convinces them that this larcenous state of affairs is a better deal, a sign of patriotism and proof of advanced morals has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Bravo, Michael Moore, for sticking your finger in the eye of the Man once again.can pay and not plied with high-priced designer drugs.

0618680004|3.0|Every once in a while a person rises as a spokesperson for a particular community, but that person is so angry and abrasive that you have to wonder if they're actually helping their cause. That is more or less how I view Richard Dawkins, at least judging from this book.    I'm not even saying that I disagree with Dawkins. I just feel like Dawkins could be a little more compassionate and understanding of the complexities of religion. I wondered while reading this book if Dawkins was dropped (for example) into the middle of rural Haiti, would he say \\"You ignorant peasants, how could you possibly think that Voodoo explains the plights of your lives?!\\"    It is well known that religion arises very naturally from all cultures, and can play an important role in keeping communities together. It's only when religion is taken to an extreme that it becomes truly harmful. Dawkins takes the stance that religion is completely useless and any other viewpoint is nonsensical. I'm sorry, Mr. Dawkins, but that absolutist perspective is just as dogmatic as the religions you're railing against. An aphorism about pots and kettles comes to mind here.    Remember how you felt after reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", like Ayn Rand had pinned you down by holding your neck to the ground with her foot and beat you over and over again with a large Capitalist stick? Well, replace Ayn Rand with Richard Dawkins, and Capitalist with Atheist, and you've got this book.    In the end, there are so many other more worthy vehicles by which a person can come upon atheism. My advice is to skip this book and instead spend some time carefully reconsidering your personal convictions and determine for yourself whose convictions they really are.    P.S. I'm fully aware that this less than glowing review will invoke a barrage of \\"unhelpful\\" votes, but in the end I just hope that my review will help thoughtful people avoid myopic polemics like Dawkins.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner is an amazing film in many ways.  It is very artistic, reflective and overall a wonderful piece of cinema that will hold up over the years despite being released in 1982. Ridley Scott is a superb director and this is one of his best films and is one of my personal favorites.  Harrison Ford also does a wonderful job and the story will keep you thinking long after watching this. What is great about this set is that you don't have to worry, \\"which version should I get?\\" because it comes with all of them!  How cool is that?  FIVE DISCS for ONLY 27.95?  Amazing.  This is THE version of the film to buy, and in high-def.  I've been waiting on this for YEARS.  Also Blade Runner and music fans, may I suggest the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis.  (UPC 0 7567-82623-2 6)  The expanded soundtrack features more music from the score not released in the film and is just as powerful and evocative as the movie.
B000002J1M|4.0|How could I have missed this album all of these years? This is fantastic music! I have been going through some prog rock groups older material when I read some glowing reviews of some of the earlier Genesis work. Being a Peter Gabriel fan, I was willing to invest some of my hard earned coin on faith. I must say that the first few listens did not provide the reward I was banking on. Then I listened to Nursery Chryme for about the fourth time and something clicked. Hey, I didn't hear that before! Where were those great sounds hiding earlier? It was like I finally was allowed into some secret club or something because now I was hearing the Genesis sound for the first time. It was rich and wonderful. Then I listened to this album again and wow, Watcher of the Skies almost took my breath away! The rest of the album also opened up as a solid progressive rocker. If you are a Genesis fan (early or later years) or a Peter Gabriel fan, this album is a true gem and a MUST HAVE. Once in your hands, play it repeatedly and I assure you the magic will reveal itself. - Ciao
B000TFINY6|4.0|EDIT: Since first writing this \\"review\\" the price of Lost - The Complete Third Season on Blu-ray has had a price drop!  So now it's even better.      First reaction seeing this listing... wow is it expensive!  Lost is one of my favorite television shows and I have still held out owning them for my home use because I have been waiting on high-def!  And now I am thrilled it is for Blu-ray (which I always thought it would be seeing the connection with Disney (ABC) and Blu-ray) because I am a Blu-ray supporter.  Of course the regular DVDs can be upconverted to high-def, which looks okay, but it's NOT THE SAME!  Especially for something as amazing as Lost.  ;)    I saw a promo of Lost in high-def running at a local Best Buy store on a very nice Sony high-def television.  Let me tell you, it was INSANE!  All of the details from that island just POPPED.  The stuble on Jack's face nearly cut me it was so sharp looking!    Know this... Lost on Blu-ray is going to look amazing.  Now let's just hope for seasons one and two to show up as well.

FURTHER, THIS VERSION POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE AND EVEN SHOWS A PICTURE OF THE YOUNGEST SISTER & HER HUSBAND AS NOT BEING HAPPY AS THEIR MARRIAGE WAS BASED ON INFIDELITY & HER DISDAIN AT NOT HAVING A BIG, FANCY MILITARY WEDDING DUE TO THE INAPPOPRIATENESS OF THEIR ACTIONS.

B000P7V46C|5.0|\\"...And Then There Were Three\\" is the 3th post-Peter Gabriel album, originally issued in 1978. It continued the sophisticated sound of the previous 2 albums, albeit in shorter songs. I got the 1994 reissue but the temptation of a bunch of DVD bonus materials was such that I did buy the \\"Genesis 1976-1982\\" 6 CD/6 DVD set.<br /><br />As to the CD, \\".. And Then There Were Three\\" (11 tracks, 53 min.) remains a fabulous listen almost 30 years later. From the opening moments of \\"Down and Out\\" to the beautiful \\"Undertow\\" (one of Banks' better tracks ever), and on it goes. Other highlights for me are \\"Snowbound\\", another one of Rutherford's beautiful ballads, and \\"Down In the Motherlode\\". The album closer \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" was an unexpected hit and would foreshadow the band's evolution to a more commercial, mainstream sound on subsequent albums.<br /><br />As to the DVD, it first brings the album in a terrific 5.1 surround system, and it sounds fantastic if you have the proper home music set-up (which I do). As to the visuals, it comes with the videos for Many Too Many and Follow You Follow Me, nice but nothing earth-shattering. The \\"Reissue Interviews 2007\\" brings about 20 min. of the guys bringing their perspectives on the album, quite entertaining (and revealing that they are not particularly pleased how the album now sounds, with almost 30 years of hindsight). The real jem is a 40 min. BBC documentary \\"Three Dates with Genesis\\", which follows the band on 3 gigs, in Germany, Holland and culminating with their headlining gig at the famed Knebworth festival in 1978. The performances are okay, but the real eye-opener is to see a behind the scenes look of a big festival in 1978 (admission price: 5.50 British Pounds!), it's like watching a time capsule, just terrific.<br /><br />If you are considering buying any of the reissued CD/DVD albums, you really should look at buying the \\"1976-1982\\" box instead as it offer far more \\"bang for the buck\\" (only $69 here on Amazon), and on top it comes with a bonus CD/DVD of assorted B-sides, EPs and other hard to find tracks from that era.h a bonus CD/DVD of assorted B-sides, EPs and other hard to find tracks from that era.

B000P7V45S|5.0|\\"A Trick of the Tail\\" is the first post-Peter Gabriel album of Genesis, originally issued in 1976. When Gabriel left after \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", the survival of the band was much in question, but after a long search for a new lead singer, drummer Phil Collins (who had sung lead on one track on the \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" album) stepped up. I got the 1994 reissue but the temptation of a bunch of DVD bonus materials was such that I did buy the \\"Genesis 1976-1982\\" 6 CD/6 DVD set.<br /><br />As to the CD, \\"A Tick of the Tail\\" (8 tracks, 51 min.) remains a fabulous listen 31 years later. From the opening \\"Dance On a Volcano\\", the band shows it is as good, if not better, than anything it ever did in the Peter Gabriel era. \\"Entangled\\" remains as spell-binding as ever. \\"Squonk\\" finds the band charging hard, to end in a beautiful gentle outro, wow. \\"Mad Man Moon\\" is a great Tony Banks ballad. \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\" brings out the lighter side of the band, and it was the track that opened some mainstream attention, with its witty video. The beautiful ballad \\"Ripples\\" and the happy \\"A Trick of the Tale\\" also gained some attention. The instrumental closer \\"Los Endos\\" perfectly summarizes the album, and would be a concert staple for years to come. Wow... what an ablum. It's hard for me to pinpoint my favorite Genesis album, but I've probably played this album more than any other over the years.<br /><br />As to the DVD, it first brings the album in a terrific 5.1 surround system, and it sounds fantastic if you have the proper home music set-up (which I do).

The absolute 'must-have' is a 45 min. footage of a 1976 concert, with surprisingly good audio and video quality, and bringing mesmorizing and stunning performances.

B00005JPQR|3.0|These Bourne movies are very frustrating for me because they're good enough to get me involved and interested, even though I'm not generally into action movies. Good plot, decent acting, the movies are just FUN...or, they could be, if the camera work weren't so nauseating.     Apparently, someone's decided that everything is SO much more exciting if you can't really see what's happening. This is a big disadvantage in a movie that's two-thirds chase scenes. In some parts, I was nearly convinced there was no actual car chase--just a cameraman waving his lens in front of walls, sidewalks, the sky and the street while the soundman played a tape of squealing car tires.    In fact, I didn't especially want to see this third installment because of the same problem with The Bourne Supremacy; I remember having started to feel a little queasy during a big chase scene. Knowing what to expect this time, I looked away when things started getting too crazy. I knew it was only going to be speed-blurred swipes of random scenery anyway, so why bother trying to focus? Besides, I thought if I missed anything important, I'd just ask my husband later. Turns out he, the big action movie fan, had done the same thing! Kind of a waste of film, really. Whoopee, crazy-cam is so cutting edge and exciting, but only up to the point where people can still stand to watch it and see what's going on.    Good series. Bad, seriously overused technique. Why do they keep doing this? Must be getting kickbacks from Dramamine.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album remains fresh to this day because the themes Meat Loaf sings of are universal and timeless importance. Meat Loaf sings of love the way it REALLY happens in real life and this helps to bolster the sales of this album to this day.<br /><br />The CD track set begins with the title track, \\"Bat Out Of Hell.\\" The strong intro really rocks hard--love those guitars! Meat Loaf sings this as if it were easy--even though of course we know it really isn't. Meat Loaf's voice is full of energy and masculine warmth. \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" explores the desire to remain in a relationship even though he has some ambivalence about his girlfriend. The tempo is just right and the melody sports a dramatic quality to it that truly makes \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" a masterpiece. Good backup vocals, too.<br /><br />\\"You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)\\" opens with a great dialogue about a boy who wants to spend romantic time with his girlfriend--and when she accepts he's rather happy about it even if all he says is \\"I bet you say that to all the boys.\\" The music starts immediately and Meat Loaf takes charge of this song about two young kids who are lusting for each other without much patience! The backup chorus creates a heavenly effect that works well against the purely primal desire for romance with someone you find attractive. The guitars work well and the percussion bolsters this hard rockin' number, too!<br /><br />\\"All Revved Up With Nowhere To Go\\" explores teenage angst; a young man wants to romance a young woman and maybe even have a relationship with her but he just can't quite get up the nerve to approach her. The lyrics don't tell us if she has anyone else in her life--it wouldn't matter to this boy. He just wants her alone with him. The melody rocks and has a distinctly poignant flavor to it that reflects pure genius on the part of Jim Steinman who wrote this song. Again, Meat Loaf uses a great backup chorus at times to enhance the number. \\"All Revved Up With Nowhere To Go\\" is definitely a rock opera type of ballad.<br /><br />\\"Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad\\" is my favorite song on this album; Meat Loaf sings the story of a love affair gone awry. Sure, his woman wants him to love her--but her love goes unrequited. In fact, he's \\"crying icicles instead of tears\\" because of there is no warmth and true love in their relationship. The lines \\"Don't be sad/'Cause two out of three ain't bad\\" are incredibly meaningful--factual, heartless and sarcastic all at once; he tells his woman that he can never love her--at least not anymore. The backup vocals shine and the melody stays strong for this song about deep angst and sorrow.<br /><br />Yet another masterpiece on the very same album would be the encapsulated rock opera story told in the song \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light.\\" The young man really wants to be romantic with his girlfriend--who makes him promise her that he'll always love her. Of course, this doesn't hold up over time. However, what makes this song a classic is not so much the story but rather how the story is presented. The song rocks with an optimistic flavor leading up to the girlfriend's allowing her man to be romantic with her. The story is told in flashback as the young man eventually laments the fact that he did promise his love to her. He remains stuck with this young woman forever; and boy, does he come to regret his promise! Great background vocals include the voice of former Yankee shortstop Phil \\"Scooter\\" Rizzuto talking about their romantic encounter as if the young man were a baseball player trying to score a home run!<br /><br />The CD ends with two bonus tracks that were previously unreleased: \\"Great Boleros Of Fire\\" and \\"Bat Out Of Hell.\\" \\"Great Boleros Of Fire\\" has a beautiful intro with the piano in the background as Meat Loaf sings. The song's intensity increases as it moves along. \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" is a live track from a Meat Loaf concert in 1978. The song starts with a Wagnerian feel complete with minor chords on the piano; and the guitars rock great, too! There's an incredible opening musical flourish and when Meat Loaf comes in this number takes off--just like a bat out of hell! The live track of \\"Bat Out Of hell\\" provides a strong ending for this album.<br /><br />The liner notes include great photos of Meat Loaf and the lyrics to each song. The artwork reflects good judgment.<br /><br />Meat Loaf and this classic album remain very popular because of how this album deals with universally important topics regarding love, sorrow, and teenage angst.

The distortions will remain in the minds of those who are unwilling to read accounts of the Greek-Persian Wars.  As the youth view the \\"heroic\\" battle, they would be unaware that the actions of Xerxes was very similar to President Bush in Iraq.  The Greeks had acted as terrorists and even burnt a Persian city.  The Persians were reacting in defense of their own homeland.  But, fact is not what the young audiences of today want.  The charge of rhinos and Xerxes dressed up as some crossdresser will appeal to illerate.

With all its flaws, I actually found this movie to be quite entertaining. The first half I was really thinking that there was no way he would actually fight. He looks like he was spit out from a wood-chipper. I was wondering where all his money has gone, or did he simply enjoy living in his old stomping grounds. His restaurant looked like it was somewhat profitable. What I disliked most about the movie was the halucinogenic fight scene. What's with all that back and forth, black and white, jerky, grainy special effects? The fight scenes in the earlier movies were much easier to watch.

That just goes to show you how real it is, realistic, dramatic and gripping tale set in an America that was not so long ago.  If you are a younger person wanting to expand the fictional horizons of your library this would be a good book to start with.  I first saw the TV movie of it when I was in Junior High and never forgot it.  Years later I bought this Centennial Edition and now have probably read it four times.  It is just one of those stories that has so much power with the power of love, but also carries a world of pain.  Don't read my review any more just go read this novel if you have not already!
